It occurs to me that I should have mentioned something I noticed when
fitting a new foam sseal around the tinware -- my engine appears to be a
good 1/4 - 1/2 inch too far back (rear is rear of vehicle.)  I don't
know if that's just a red herring.  The tin at the front and rear of the
engine reflect this so it's not just a piece of bent tin.

Cheers,

Chris.
