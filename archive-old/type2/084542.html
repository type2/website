Subject: &quot;Stupid Mistake&quot; is running!

Yep, sounds great.

We put our rebuilt Type 1 engine into our bus, hooked up the electrical and 
it started!!

Sounded great.

I put on a head temperature device on cylinder #3 and it never got over 
275oF (VDO gage).

Is that temp OK?

Is an oil temp or pressure gage advised?

But, I could not turn the engine off!

Turned the key off an nada, kept running.

Disconnected the battery and nada, kept running.

Thought it might have a demon!

Then remembered that I put in an alternator with internal regulator.

I think I hooked up the wiring from the key to the alternator wrong.

I have been ploughing through the wiring diagrams.

Can anyone point me into the right direction on this?

Many thanks.


Bill and Erik Spencer
