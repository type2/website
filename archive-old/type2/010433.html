Dr. Tim,

Why not save yourself a bunch of headaches (not to
mention a crap-load of time) and create a web-site
about the DM???? Otherwise, if you are still a
list-member, say, a year from now, you may find
yourself having to reply to the same question literaly
a hundred times....an easy way to burn-out, I assure
you.

It's free, it's fun and you never have to type the
same response twice again!

Speaking as a list-member of close to 2 years (a
newbie to some, an ancient to others;-), I can say
that the info contained on fellow list-member's
web-sites can be invaluable. Sometimes even more so
than the list itself (like when you have that &quot;mystery
carb problem at three AM, the night before a
long-distance-road-trip!&quot;).


If you are intersted and don't know where to start,
let me know; there's a *lot* of quick ways to get
started... I just started my site (mostly photos and
stories) 3 months ago and it rapidly went from 2 pages
to 6, and I'm currently changing it to a
frames-format, as I have enough photos/info for it to
grow to 15 pages!


Lemme know if I can help....you have some *really*
good info; I'd like to see everyone be able to use it
(including myself).


If you'd like to see my site, click on the link under
my name....please keep in mind that I'm in the process
of remodelling it.
