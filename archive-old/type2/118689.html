Subject: RE: [T2] white dot and clutch alignment

Mine didn't have a white dot, but it did have some whitish hieroglyphics, so
I lined that up. Not sure if that's correct...

I just noticed that Bentley makes mention of aligning the clutch with the
flywheel 180 degrees with respect to a white dot for balancing. Are the dots
still used?
