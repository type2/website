Subject: Re: [T2] VW boat

I like the disclaimer by the Tennessee Airboat Co:
&quot;We use air
cooled VW based engines. These engines are modified with larger
main bearings to better support the propeller and a roller bearing is
also added to accomodate the thrust of the propeller. With these
modifications there is no need for any other kind of drive system
unless, an optional reduction drive is desired.
Our boats are approximately 7' x 12' and 7' x 14'. We can furnish
engines from 1600 cc to 2110 cc............
The use of the term VW by Tennessee Airboat Company is for
the purpose of description only. No connection between Tennessee
Airboat Company and VW is implied or intended.&quot;

&gt; And of course, everyone who has sealed up a Beetle and added a propeller
&gt; to turn it into a boat!
