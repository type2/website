Subject: My &quot;busquest&quot; continued

How 'bout a little more newbie advice. Here's the condensed version of where 
I am.Bus in S.C. wasn't for me(many reasons). Told some of you 'bout one here 
in my area :). '72 Westy, two owner, &quot;pancake&quot; engine w/12k on engine. 
Interior perfect and original. Feel good about this bus. This guy was 
literally interviewing me the first two times we got together to decide if i 
would be a good home(I liked that)! My concerns are two... First some of you 
said 4k was too much unless it was mint. I found a guy _at_ this site on the 
A.I.R.S. list who happens to live a few blocks from me, who went to check it 
out for me. Says that I didn't do this camper justice over the phone, and 
that it's darn close to mint. I impulsively,(swore I wouldn't do this 
impulsively) put 3800 bucks cash in front of the guy a couple of weeks ago 
and he wouldn't budge, saying he already came off a grand, he doesn't need 
the money, and he's staying put. I believe him. Is this ridiculously too 
high? I lean toward a good running bus because I'm on a serious learning 
curve here(reading my new copy of Muir's book nightly). The other question is 
the rust under the windshield. (There is one small dent in rear end but 
otherwise the body is great.) Some of you responded that the windshield rust  
was a grand to 1500 to repair, but how was this repairing it? I want to know 
my alternatives and what's recommended. Do I replace the entire front end? If 
so are they in production still or am I off to the graveyards? The affected 
area is so narrow in width vertically that I wonder if that can be fixed 
somehow, but gut feeling tells me that since bay window fits here, it would 
be hard to do a long term repair and have it also look right. I also plan to 
have it painted, so I understand pretty well what that cost will be.  I think 
the pop-tops are made of fiberglass but not sure. Can these be painted and if 
so, do  they look good?The guy who was kind enough to go with me said he 
really didn't care for them, but didn't elaborate.
Thanks in advance for helping to get me closer to a decision!
