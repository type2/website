&gt;Based on many postings and what I've read, I don't want to tighten the
&gt;single nut too much.  I'm also concerned that the PO or their mechanic may
&gt;have already tightened it too much and have cracked the case.
&gt;
&gt;I've purchased a in/lb torque wrench that I can set to 108 in/lbs (9 ft/lbs)
&gt;- but before I proceed I'd like to know, if possible, if the case is intact
&gt;or not.  Does anyone know of a way to check this without opening the case?

If the boss is cracked the bolt holding the oil pump may not tighten in the threads.

Sometimes part of the boss cracks and falls off completely.

This is what the damage looks like but it's hard to see without opening up the case:
