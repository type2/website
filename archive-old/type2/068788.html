to
&gt; &gt;go in there, there wouldn't be anything worth while anyway.     Don't lock

&gt; This is my personal strategy.  Well, the unlocked, key in ignition (most of
&gt; the time), dirty, full of stuff tactic has worked well.  Once in a while I
&gt; vacuum and get everything clean, but the stuff just has no where else to
&gt; go.  My car always looks like someone's living in there.  

Hell, I really can't go with this at all.  I figure that if you've got
something as beautiful as a vintage bus, then you want to keep it
beautiful; well, maybe that's just me...?

If you keep your bus lloking like shit, you obviously don't take a great
deal of pride in it, or respect for it...if you don't respect your bus,
then why do you subscribe to this list...?

OK,OK, enough...flame me if you must...go on!
