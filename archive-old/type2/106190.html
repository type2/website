&gt; Well after
&gt; resolving some electrical problems, putting 5 gal of
&gt; gas in the tank, and static timing the engine, I
&gt; sprayed some starting fluid in the intake and turned
&gt; the key. It automatically sprung to life for 5-7
&gt; seconds. and quit.

Starter fluid will do just that.

It's a long way from the tank to the #1 injector. What I do, is turn the key
and deflect the flap in the AFM by hand to bring the fuel rail up to
pressure. The pressure regulator is totally mechanical so when 35 psi is
reached it will return the excess fuel to the tank so there is no danger of
pressure build-up.

Run the pump for 15 seconds, put the air filter back on, then start the
engine and see if it idles.

&gt; Oh, question, From what I
&gt; understand, all of the injectors fire at the same time
&gt; when the points are open, right? I just wanted to make
&gt; sure that the problem did not lie in me having the
&gt; injector wires switched.

Yes, all at the same time. Motronic is the L-Jet variant that fires each
injector individually.

&gt; Any way, I am through working
&gt; on it tonight and thought I would see if any one had
&gt; any suggestion. Is there anything that I may be
&gt; missing? I am seriously thinking of getting a remote
&gt; starter so I can do some of the diagnostic tests that

Get one. It will be useful for compression tests. There's a nice one with a
red LED that will indicate that the battery is connected.

&gt; bently suggests without having someone else crank the
&gt; engine for me. Oh, FYI, This is a 914 2L engine with
&gt; 79 fed F.I. mated to a 73 automatic transmission in a
&gt; 74 bus.

Where do the neck bolts go? ;-)
