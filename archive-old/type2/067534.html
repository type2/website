Subject: maggie progress report day 4

First of all, a very special thanks to all those who have so far
contributed aid in my journey.

We left off with CVs disassmebled and discovery of bad wheel bearings.  In
the rear that is.

Today:  Fan: back in.  Or practically so.  This is, of course, the whole
entire reason I had to remvoe the sucker in the first place.

Wheel Bearings: no change.  Have to wait till tomorrow to get replacements.

Rear Seal: replaced.

Torque Converter seal: replaced.

Oil cooler seals: given up on.  In order to do that, the fan housing has to
come  off.  I tried, but the housing is blocked by the exhaust and the heat
exchangers.  Shoot, the things not leaking anway, I just figured it would
be easier to replace it now.  It ain't so easy, so I'll replace 'em later.

Front seal.  Problem.  In order to access the seal, I have to remove the
drive plate, which is roughly equivalent to the flywheel in most of yall's
sticks.  In order to remove that, I need to remove six 12-pointed bolts,
akin to the ones on the CVs.  Except that these are 9mm instead of 6, and
9mm allen key only manages to strip them out (hopefully not so bad that the
12 point driver won't work).  The trick is finding the tool.  I struck out
at Sears, 3 auto parts stores and two hardware stores.  Tomorrow I'll try
industrial supply, Snap-On or Mac (if I can figure out how to contact them,
there is no number listed locally).

CV joints: not much progress.  I am still wondering whether it's OK to use
em, even tho the hubs are very badly pitted.  I'm thinking I'm going for
it, if I can't find replacement hubs only, and saving up for CV joints.

I guess that's about it.
