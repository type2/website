&gt; *SOME*how..I got roped into helping judge the VW car show at Darlington SC
&gt; this weekend... Anybody else going to be there?
&gt; Look for a tall, balding dude with a reddish beard. I'll be checking engine
&gt; and tranny numbers...
&gt; You *will* lose points for a mazda engine in your 77 westy..trust me....

What about a small aluminum block Oldes V8? &lt;G&gt;  I guy here at work
put one into his Ghia first then a Westy.  It's REALLY neat to see a 
VW camper give a Camaro a run for it's money!!
