Have you thought about a swamp cooler?

&gt; Here is my problem:  My wife has been VERY tolerant of my VW obsession,
&gt; but the fact that none of my busses has working AC really bugs her (and
me)
&gt; when it gets really hot on those long trips.  For those of you in cooler,
&gt; or dryer climates, you might not understand, but here in Kansas, it can be
&gt; 100 degrees or more and have 100% humidity!!  Now that's hot.
&gt;
&gt; But not only do we want to air-condition for the trips, but also for those
&gt; hot sleepless nights at the campgrounds.
