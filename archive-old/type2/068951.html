Subject: 12V heat

1)Okay. I've seen this thread before and I have tried the cheap 12V heaters
that put out about as much heat as a lightbulb. A nice afgan works better.

The question I have... is my mom used to have a GM Van.. in the back was a
12V floor heater that pumped out mega heat... it actually worked. It was a
square box about a foot high and two feet long. 

If I go down to GM and pick up one of these puppys or get one from a wrecker. 
can my little Veedub alternator handle it?

2)Has anyone tried those 12V heated seat covers with the &quot;massage&quot; points?
Do these get adequately hot.. I saw one in Canadian Tire the other day and
it was reasonably inexpensive like under $60 CAN ($40 US).
