Subject: Re: [T2] No new Type II

I have to agree with Ron. I was following the &quot;New Microbus&quot; as soon
as the spy shots hit the web.

VW is in a bad place right now to offer a completely new vehicle for
just the North American (read US) market. The safety equipment alone
would cost close to what the (converted to today's dollars) original
bus did. Minivans were big targets for the safety groups due to the
almost certainty that children would be riding inside and Chrysler's
attempt to classify minivans as utility trucks.

I'd love for them to step back, look at the Eurovan from a &quot;common
man&quot; view. Small family, making $50k a year, wife possibly pulling in
another $30k. This was actually me before my wife got lupus, and now
doesn't work.

Take the EV, and strip it. Make it as minimalist as possible. Minimum
padding, minimum sound deadening, minimum everything. 2 seats in the
front and a pair of benches in the back. No &quot;fold the seats into
nothingness&quot;, no 45 speaker sound system with DVD and navigation. No
OnStar (shudders at the thought of having OnStar). No AWD. Steel
wheels. Leave the AC in though... heh

Sell it at as close to cost as possible!

In today's SUV world, a large percentage of buyers will grab the
&quot;upgrades&quot; because that's how they've been conditioned. And that's
where VW will make its profits. But if the price dropped to around
$25-ish I might be able to swing a purchase. Under $16k and I'd be
first in line. It would generate another cult vehicle, IMHO. And that
is absolutely what VW needs right now. They started it well with the
New Beetle, and need to continue the concept.

Sorry for the ramble, but I've been wishing for this for a while.
