&gt; I've also heard of this being done. A friend of a friend of mine has used a
&gt; pump, and a mist system over the cylinders of his type 1 engine to acheive
&gt; cooler temperatures. This (to me) doesn't seem as potentially effective as
&gt; cooling the oil however.
&gt; My theory is to use a similar method as to what CPU overclockers use to
&gt; achieve lower core temperatures in their PC's. This theory involves running
&gt; external oil lines from the oil pump to a copper coil, which could be
&gt; submerged in a water reservoir. The water in this container could be cooled
&gt; via a peltier. For those of you who dont know what a peltier is: a peice of
&gt; metal that runs on electricity (12v usually), that generates great heat on
&gt; one side of the metal and very cold temperatures on the other. Place
&gt; heatsinks on both sides of the peltier - the cold heatsink submerged in the
&gt; water, and the hot side exposed to dissipate the heat.
&gt; Total cost you may ask? Around $60, including fittings, copper, and peltier.
&gt; I haven't tried this idea, but it's so simple and potentially VERY effective
&gt; that I do plan to in the near future as things get hotter here in AZ.

and where is the current coming from to run the peltier refrigerator?  I
suspect from the alternator.  Since every joule produced by the engine
(including those to run the alternator) also produces about 3 joules of
heat, you're robbing Peter to pay Paul by using the alternator to cool the
oil!

File this in the Twilight zone under &quot;P&quot; for &quot;perpetual motion machine&quot;!
