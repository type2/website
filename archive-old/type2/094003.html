Subject: Re: [T2] Please answer this question now. This is an urgent matter.

Dont use a steering wheel lock on any vehicle...I have seen these get 
snapped when tows get up to speed.  A sudden twist has the effect of the 
entire bus trying to turn the wheel.  This is why many tow drivers like 
to put the key in and unlock the steering wheel if they are not doing a 
bed tow.

&gt; personally I wouldn't trust the steering wheellock for that.  but 
&gt; rather I
&gt; would turn the key and unlock the steering then use rope to tie the 
&gt; wheel,
&gt; that way you hit a pothole or something you don't damage anything 
&gt; critical
&gt; those steering wheel locks are a PITA to change
