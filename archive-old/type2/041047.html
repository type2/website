Subject: Engine Carrier Bolts

Hi All,

Can someone tell me if the three bolts holding the engine (1600 DP) to
the carrier should all be the same size?  A PO had replaced the two
upper bolts with larger standard size bolts.  I had some extra original
(I presume) from the engine out of the single cab engine, so I used
Helicoil inserts to redo the two upper holes to the original metric
size.  However the bottom bolt bottoms out, still sticking 3/4 to 1 inch
out.

Thanks,
