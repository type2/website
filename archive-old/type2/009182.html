I find this an odd issue for us to get our boxers/thongs in a knot about. 
On the one hand, our beloved type 2s were produced in a panel version, 
which is a lot blinder than a Westfalia with the long closet. Driving 
with visibility blocked in that rear corner just requires more attention 
and modifications like the convex mirror or a Fresnel lens in the rear 
window.

On the other hand, those closets are a dime a dozen in the junkyards 
around San Diego. If there is any demand for original uncut Westfalia 
closets, I suggest that somebody go into the business of salvaging them. 
I doubt that the demand is there now, or will be any time soon.

Let's all toast each other with a virtual mug of beer, have a group hug, 
and get on with it.

Mark
