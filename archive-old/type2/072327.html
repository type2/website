Subject: Help urgent.. Heat exchanger fit...

Dear All,
I am in the process of fitting 1976 style heat exchangers with the 
copper seals and one of the seals slipped off and went in at an angle.
I didi not notice and istalled the whole exhaust.
Had a lead got everything off again and now I need a nes copper seal, 
but more importanty the clinder head and the heat exchanger both have 
a groove now where the seal was lying across...
What should I do ?
Does anyone think I will be able to get it to seal or have I killed my bus?


Please p mail since I am on digest!

Help!


Lukas
