Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter Change - cutoff valve

I saw a couple of VW busses in Italy that had the tanks on the roof. Bulky 
and not aerodynamic at all but these were delivery vehicles and seldom were 
running around at very high speeds.

Most of the vehicles I got the chance to see under to hood were converted 
had a propane &quot;ring&quot; inserted between the carb and the air filter. At the 
flip of a switch the electric gasoline pump would switch off - - the carb 
bowl would drain and when the engine stuttered a bit the other switch would 
get flipped to allow the propane service to start and the vehicle would 
continue on unstopped.

Created a dual fuel system for occasions when one fuel or the other was 
unavailable. Propane was considerably cheaper than gasoline and there was a 
tax-free black market openly operating.

Diesel was another fuel that could be bought tax-free if you were a farmer 
and used it in your tractor. A friend had a large tank of it at his house 
for his car - and he was certainly not a farmer. He bought surplus from a 
farmer friend. His friend made a bit of money and my friend saved alot of 
money.

Understand that the gasoline was $4.50-$4.75 in 1993! Their gasoline cost 
about the same to produce but the difference was in the taxes. Italy had 
many socialized programs to pay for - socialized medicine for one - and 
these crazy taxes paid for it.

Maybe 4 or 5 Westy stove tanks under the vehicle in parallel would be a 
good way to transport propane under a VW bus?

&gt; &gt; Isn't propane in the evaporator and thus in the condenser risky in the
&gt; &gt; event of a collision?
&gt;
&gt;Pretty good point Chris.  It may not be possible to make this safe.  I just
&gt;hate to not use possible refrigeration.  Maybe I can run the propane through
&gt;an old propane refrigerator before going to the engine and have some cold
&gt;co-colas.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Where will you locate your propane tank(s)? What is it like in the winter?
&gt; &gt; What is the cost adavantage in the US? I'm in TN but I have not priced
&gt; &gt; propane recently.
&gt;
&gt;Propane price is roughly 75% of gasoline and varies widely in price.  It is
&gt;available by delivery in Virginia and at all U-Hauls and KOA campgrounds.
&gt;I can see getting a big Propane tank in my yard and just filling up there.
&gt;In addition, it is available in the blue rhino tanks at many places if one
&gt;is in a pinch.  It is more available in Canada and Europe.  One gets a $2000
&gt;fed tax deduction and in Virginia a $200 state income tax deduction for
&gt;making the conversion.  In the UK, I understand that one gets a grant to
&gt;compensate for 80% of the cost of the conversion, or something like that.  I
&gt;might be wrong, but I think that I read that somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;I am not sure about tank location.  Most convenient would be the current gas
&gt;tank location.  However, there may be a problem with the max possible size.
&gt;One can only fill a propane tank 80% to allow for PVT expansion and one will
&gt;only get about 75% of the MPG's, so there will be a range limit for a given
&gt;tank size.  I cannot help but view the areas under and between the wheels as
&gt;a location to put tanks, or at least storage.  There is a lot or room under
&gt;there that could be put to use.  Multiple tanks would be an minor
&gt;engineering problem.  The boiling point is -44F, it doesn't get that cold
&gt;here in VA, so the winter should not be a problem.
