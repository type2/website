&gt; In the dash is a place to the right of the Speedometer that is a 
&gt; blank round punch-out.   I *know* i've seen a triple gauge unit there 
&gt; in someone's Bus.   It was Temp, Oil Pressure and one other just like 
&gt; in my old Mercedes of the same era.

well normally that was where the optional clock went. 
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone shed light on these gauge pods and where to get them?  Are 
&gt; they aftermarket or out of high-end buses?

I seem to recall that a guage from a true type IV or is it the type III
will fit there, I played with doing it and there was a pod from another VW
product that did fit there.....hmmm might have been out of that Audi 100LS
I had years ago.... I do know there is something from another VW product
that will fit there, I did it on another Bay I had many years ago 

sorry not more help than that
