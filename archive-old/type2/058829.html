Volks:
I'm going to get a new longblock, and I have in my
possession an alternator from a '74 Beetle as well as
the resquisite wiring (regulator, etc.) to make that
work.  Can I use the mechanical fuel pump from my '71
engine?  Are there any other modifications which need
to be made?  I have the fan housing and the correct
plate, etc.

TIA,
