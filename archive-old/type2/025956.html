Some people don't want to go camping because of lack of showers, here is a
really nice solution.  I found this on the tear drop page and I don't know
who made it, but they did a nice job.  Some of the best campgrounds or
camping spots don't have restrooms or showers, so this would be a great
addition.  Notice the nice wood floor.

This is the water heater in a nice carrying case:

This is where you get the water heater for a nice warm shower:

I have no connection to any of these products, just thought this was a
really nice solution to an old problem.  Of course the solar showers are
much cheaper, but you could use this one in the morning or on a cloudy day
when your solar shower won't work.  And if you have a large group, you
wouldn't run out of hot water.  Also, it just is so high tech!!!
