Subject: Volkspares Engine tear down (long)

This is what I found when I tore down a recent Volkspares engine on Friday.
Before you read on, what I found may NOT be their normal standard of work,
it may be better (I doubt) or worse. However you need to draw your own
conclusions.

As per the last few posts, Garp now has a good 1600dp in exchange for his
trashed Volkspares engine (I only needed the case for a 1776 I'm building.

Now the Volkspares 'Green' engine should come with brand new heads, both of
the heads I removed had a helicoil in one of the spark plugs (shallow
threads), both were very loose &amp; came out with the plugs. So unless &quot;Jack's&quot;
garage has fitted these (I doubt due to debris caused-Garp?) these heads are
NOT new. In addition, both of the rocker stands were spaced with crappy
small washers and the shafts could be 'rocked' on these, if you see what I
mean.

On striping the case, just about ALL of the bolts were only hand tight,
including the head bolts &amp; most of the case bolts, now I know the main bolts
have a tendency to undo but these were WAY beyond that (perhaps they expect
to be pulling their lumps apart ;-o). As Garp posted the cam plug was just a
bodge with araldite, these new Brazilian cases use a neoprene plug they must
have run out &amp; did not bother to machine for an ally plug instead
(incidentally &quot;Jack's&quot; used a water jacket plug to solve the problem, with
more glue, but I can understand not wanting to split the case).
No spring in the dizzy drive, so the drive had been fretting on the bottom
of the dizzy. (was it there when you changed the dizzy-Garp?)
The case halves were SMOTHERED in sealer (not permatex but RTV silicone),
when I removed the oil strainer I got loads of blue instant gasket out &amp;
there was much more in the rocker covers.
Also these &quot;Green&quot; engines (unleaded heads) are painted green, but there was
green paint on every thing, the case broke the paint as it split so it was
painted (or 'touched up' - I doubt) after the case had been closed. The oil
pick-up was green, as was under the generator stand &amp; inside bits of the
case, so with the crank in they happily sprayed away!
Broken fins on the barrels, look like from new!
Last but not least, 4 shims to take up end float (why they did not use
thicker ones or machine the case, I don't know), all in all a poor job. Now
remember that 'Volkspares' are also 'Big Boys Toys', so both must be tarred
with the same brush.

However Luke _at_ Terry's (yes confusing I know, like Grant _at_ Jack's!), says
that although they can't build engines for toffee they do, do a good line
bore! In fact he sends most of his machining to them?!?!?!? I guess they
invested in good tools, because the volume of engines they turn over.

Now a few points now concern me over the quality of work carried out by
&quot;Jack's VW Garage&quot;. (Garp, this might hurt). Most of the blue instant gasket
had come off from the rocker covers &amp; as I say it was everywhere and had
stuck the gaskets real bad to the heads. Sealer was in the valve springs,
jammed in the rocker gear &amp; generally had taken a vacation around the
engine.
More of a problem was the fact that Garp had lost compression on No. 4,
&quot;Jack's&quot; had (apparently) done a &quot;leak down&quot; test on this cylinder &amp;
diagnosed a problem with either valves or cylinders, including an estimate
of about £800 to replace all the P'n'C's plus 2 new heads. The reason given
(as I understand) was air coming from the push rod tubes?! Well with all the
push rod tubes exiting into the case, how can this diagnose 1 cylinder? Also
air will ALWAYS be shifted by the return stroke of the piston.
When I removed No. 4, yes it was choked from not firing, but there was no
damage to the rings, piston or the barrel (or any other for that matter).
Also the engine would run on all 4 until it warmed up. What I did find was 2
slightly tight valve clearances on No. 4, this was probably difficult to
adjust out, due to the small washers under the rocker stands. But what I
think was the MAIN cause of the failure was the fact that all the head bolts
were loose! In fact there were blow marks in the side if the heads, as the
engine warmed up the head bolts got longer &amp; valve clearances were reduced
(but if the heads loosened, would the push rods keep them open?) eventually
the compression was lost around the head.

If this is so, whoever did the first service should have tightened the heads
down (Jack's?). When the engine came in to &quot;Jack's&quot; firing on 3 cylinders,
were the clearances checked? Was the 2mm side play not seen, when adjusting?
Most important, how can they quote for £800 of repairs without having
confirmed these things. As I understand they quoted for a new engine but
were too expensive, when a Volkspares was fitted, I think it was just a case
of 'sour grapes' &amp; they thought they'd charge you for not using them in the
first place. I think you've been 'had', these people make me sick.
