&gt;I was just wondering what happened to that thing, checked the website and
&gt;it is no longer there,,,,anyone know what happened to the tour, darn it
&gt;was such a great idea too!


I'll bet it won't take long to find it.  Let's go backwards:  I had it for a
couple of hours at last year's show in Auburn Hills.  I gave it to Jamie
Rivers, who whisked it back to Canada.  I recall some painful controvery
after that, but I'll bet Jamie knows where it went, if not where it is.
