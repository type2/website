&gt; NGKs are superior to Bosch in every respect from what I've seen. 2-3% of

&gt; 
&gt; I have also found a higher incidence of plug defects with Bosch, creating
&gt; headaches since &quot;it can't be the plugs since they are new&quot;. Ugh.

I also noted that my new Mexican engine came with NGK plugs.  I've always
used Bosch without any real problems, but the machining and finish of the
NGK plugs looks better.  I like the 3/4 inch reach too!
