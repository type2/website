Subject: RE: [T2] Exp radio installers plz help ~!~

Hate to be the bearer of bad news but there is a very good chance your sony 
will not run your pioneer  cd changer. I would bet money on it unless you 
have had the 2 working together in the past.  The sony has to have the 
capability to control the pioneer and that wouldn't be standard.  If the 
pioneer changer had a remote to change discs etc and allowed a simple 
accessory in on the sony you would be fine.

Read below for more

*****
&gt;i have the radio already wired but my difficulty is that i cant seem to 
&gt;figure out whcih one of the jacks on the back of the radio are for the cd 
&gt;changer....

&gt;the cd changer has a female plug and says (&quot;Connect into the ANT switching 
&gt;unit only')
CD Changer has outputs to goto the headunit (sony)
Should also have a controller or switching unit connection for the headunit 
(sony)
Since its a pioneer it won't be the same.

&gt;ok now the only thing i can figure is that this female plug has to be 
&gt;connected to one of the following female jacks that is on the back of my 
&gt;radio...
&gt;i have a single male RCA plug that i can if this is what is needed connect 
&gt;the females together with...?
Inputs on your deck are typically female, they allow accesories such as 
ipods/mp3, tv's etc etc to hook in and give input levels to the deck/radio. 
(Includes cd changers).  Normally you would control what goes in by the 
device itself. IPOD music by accessing the ipod.

Outputs are usually male RCA (or digital connections depending on how fancy 
your unit is).  Outputs goto your amp.


&gt;there is no other wires to be connected for the cd changer except for the 
&gt;loose female ANT wire...?
This wire tells the cd changer when the radio is on (catches a signal) and 
turns on when the deck is on.

&gt;it has a wire remote with it.............. that just has a power button on 
&gt;it....
&gt;
&gt;i have power to the cd changer just no way of running it through the radio 
&gt;so that it will sound the tunes that are playing in the cd changer... thats 
&gt;why i am settled that somehow that ANT wire has to connect to one of the 
&gt;following in the drawing... of the radio...? assumption can be bad 
&gt;though...!
It will be the wrong wire. However there is an off chance your cd changer 
sends signals to your head unit by fm channel signal. Normally it doesn't 
require a wire, it sends the signal in the air, radio picks it up on a 
certain frequency and you can hear the music.

Your picture of the deck(Sony) shows a remote in. To control the cd changer 
there would have to be a wire coming from the pioneer to the deck to control 
what songs and cds are being played.
Maybe email me the model number of the deck(radio/sony) and the cd 
changer(Pioneer) and I can narrow all this down for you.

&gt;ok my amp well not sure how it fits into all this...?
CD Changer sends signal to your radio/deck.
Deck Radio sends signal to your amplifier and it sends out the 
music(amplified) to your speakers and subs.  Your radio also has speaker 
outs to play music without the amp but at lower levels.

&gt;it has a high input plug but is missing the wires for it.....
Normally you dont need the high input plug and it's an extra. This is for 
old radio/head units that don't have an audio out rca plug. It would take 
the high speaker levels into the amp without damaging the amp.  Yours has 
outs for the amp. No worries there.

&gt;it has rca jacks on it that say L+ R+  and they are red and white plugs 
&gt;...female
The sony rca outs connect to these. Gives the music to the amp to do what it 
does

&gt;&gt;on the other side of the amp is the  output plug and it has L+ R+ and 
&gt;&gt;there are four wires ...assuming that these are for the sub woofers....?
You can hook up speakers or subs to the amp through those outputs.
There are different configs for different brands of amps to do different 
things.
(sounds cryptic I know) ie: basic left right output to speakers, mono or 
stereo
output to subs.. some configs drop highs for the subs to not damage them etc 
etc.

&gt;and then the plug next to that is the power plug with orange red and 
&gt;black...
Red is usually battery
Black Negative
Orange is usually accesorry to turn the amp on.. connects to accessory on 
the deck
or even the antenna, etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;red is battery?
&gt;orange is acc..?
&gt;and black is a ground...

&gt;ok so there is the lay out if someone can please help me.....
&gt;i have gotten this far and had to stop and cant install any further till i 
&gt;can figure this cd changer out...
*******What are the model numbers of the amplifier, radio and changer?******
