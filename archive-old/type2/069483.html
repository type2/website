Subject: Re: Valve Adjustment - Procedure

Your mechanic is probibly right. However, the method of finding TDC on
#1, setting the clearence on it, turning the crank 180 deg
Counter-Clockwise so the #2 is at TDC,setting the clearence, etc, etc.
etc., is the easiest to learn, use,  and remember.

IMHO --  *KISS* --  (keep it simple, stupid)

&gt; &gt; The &quot;180 degree engine turn = 90 degree rotor turn&quot; is very much correct. I
&gt; &gt; start with the engine at top-dead-center and move the engine back
&gt; &gt; counter-clockwise, stopping every 180 degrees and adjusting the valves in
&gt; &gt; 1-2-3-4 order. The way of Saint Muir is the answer!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Now my mechanic told me that at TDC I can adjust:
&gt;    #1 exhaust and intake
&gt;    #2 intake
&gt;    #4 exhaust
&gt; 
&gt; then turn the engine 360 degrees counterclockwise (rotor turns 180 degrees) and adjust
&gt;   #2 exhaust
&gt;   #3 intake and exhaust
&gt;   #4 intake
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a true?  Is it a good idea?
