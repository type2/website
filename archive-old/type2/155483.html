Subject: Re: [T2] Definition of a VW Cultist

&gt;  How does one determine the correct mixture?  I have to run mine pretty
&gt; lean to keep it from dieseling.  (Single Weber).  How much does it affect
&gt; head temperatures?
&gt;


I had one of those carbs on a Pinto way back when, but I never did anything
to it other than replace vacuum lines for the vacuum controlled automatic
transmission.

Lean=heat. I don't know how Type 1 engines handle it, but our Type 4's have
those delicate heads that dislike heat. I've already experienced a sunk
valve in the GWB, and have no desire to experience it again in the Guac.
