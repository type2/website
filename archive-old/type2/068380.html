Another totally unrelated bit.

With some fears I went to see the Who Monday night at USAir,
I was terribly afraid that the experience was going to be a
real big let down, that my favorite rock group, humbled
by age and deafness were going to frankly suck.

They were excellent, Townshend did a fine job playing acoustic and
did in fact play some electric, his brother did an excellent job
with the rest.  Daltrey and Entwistle were in exceptional form.
The new drummer (Ringo Star's son?) was the embodiment of a young
Moon, the horn section incredible.  Gary Glitter and Billy Idol
I could have done without but they did fair jobs.  Still Quadrophenia
is my favorite album, they played it all in a multimedia light show
setting, then finished with &quot;Who are You&quot;, &quot;Wont Get Fooled Again&quot;,
and &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;.  Was a long show 2.5 hours at least but seemed
like minutes.  &quot;5:15&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Jimmy&quot; among others were the best I
have ever heard them.

I figure this list has some (possibly geriatric) fans out there, and
I feel a lot of people are sitting on the fence as whether to see them
or not particularly hearing Townshend will/can play only acoustic.  The
shows have not sold well, particularly compared to the last tour,
course they were playing Tommy then.  Go see them, this is likely
finally their &quot;last concert in the USA&quot; but they have said that at
least 4 times.  Anyway anyone who is or wants to feel young again will
not be dissapointed.  They play Philly on Sunday and some more of the
East, I don't know what else.  Sort of neat seeing 40 year olds taking
their kids to see them BTW, that is staying power as &quot;the worlds
greatest rock and roll band.&quot;
