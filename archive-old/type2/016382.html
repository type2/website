Miles,
	For around 25 to 40 USD, someone skilled in the art of opening locked
vehicles safely can open it without damage... rates may vary, but these
people are insured (be sure to ask them, though) if they cause any
damage, which I would recommend first, before you try doing it yourself.
	On older vehicles, the weatherstripping is often brittle and easily
damaged... the bushings for the lock control rods are often worn, too,
and it becomes easier to knock a rod out of its place.
	Many tow truck/wrecker drivers carry &quot;lockout&quot; kits... it would be
cheaper to call one of them rather than a professional locksmith, IMHO,
but it may take them a bit longer to open your bus.
	Doing it yourself... I would suggest one of 2 ways, both which require
that you make the tools to do it yourself. The first involves making a
&quot;vent window&quot; tool. Find a straight piece of very stiff wire, twice as
thick as coat-hanger wire, and about 30 cm long. Taking a pair of
pliers, bend 2 cm of the end of the wire so that it is at a 90 degree
angle to the rest of the wire. At that bend in the wire, with the stubby
2 cm end facing you and on your LEFT (important!), take the next 12 to
13 cm of wire and bend it down around a tin can or something below it...
so that it forms a perfect half-circle. It must be a half circle. At the
end of the half circle (on the right side), opposite the 2 cm stubby
end, make another 90 degree bend in the wire so that the rest of the
wire appears just like the stubby piece, only longer. Make a tiny loop
at the end of the wire so that you will have some leverage on the tool.
	This tool is to be used on the passenger (!) side vent window... apply
some lube, spit, whatever, to the area between the vent window frame and
the weatherstripping. There is a hinge or pivot that the vent window
turns on, and it is best to apply the lube between that and the roll-up
window. Take the tool you have made, and placing the stubby end parallel
with the vent window at the gap I mentioned, work it gently between the
rubber and the vent window frame until you can see it on the inside of
the bus. Then work the half circle part in... and get the last 90 degree
bend through the gap. You will then be able to move the tool around,
grap the vent window lock, and move it forward to the unlocked position,
gaining access to the car.
	The second tool is more of an all purpose tool... and can be made from
a variety of materials. You need a thin metal strip at least 2 cm wide
and about a meter long, and a piece of string a bit longer... gently
bend the end of the metal strip so that you can hook it on what you are
trying to grab (lock button, tab, lever, etc...) and secure the string
on the bent end... The strip and string are then carefully inserted
between the door and the weatherstripping around the passenger side door
handle level on the back side of the door... and pushed in until they
reach the area that you want to grab. pulling on the string then causes
the metal strip to get closer to your goal. Moving it around and
tinkering with it some will allow the car to be unlocked.
	These are to be used only on your own vehicle and noone else's, of
course... I carry a set of lockout tools that I had to buy when I worked
for a wrecker service that did not provide them to the drivers, and they
have come in handy on many occasions.
