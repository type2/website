It is original. Here is a pic of it. #59 is it and it is on both ends.

And 211 611 833C  is the correct part number.


&gt;  I pulled the plastic tube off of the
&gt; reservoir on the master cylinder, and there was a deteriorated rubber seal
&gt; of some kind in the end of the plastic tube.
&gt;
&gt; My questions:
&gt;
&gt; Is that rubber thing supposed to be there, or did a previous 'mechanic'
rig
&gt; it up?
&gt;
&gt; If the rubber thing is correct, does anyone know the part number, and a
&gt; source for a new one?  RMMW shows a part which *might* be correct, 211 611
&gt; 833C, called a 'grommet'.
&gt;
&gt; If the rubber is not correct, how is this joint sealed?
