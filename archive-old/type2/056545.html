Subject: Mounting tires - Am I cheap or what?
Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

I finished sand blasting, prime and painting a set of bus wheels. Got the new
tires (Mich 185 14 RF) too. Well I do most of my work at night, after work when
all the local stores and garages are closed. 

So here I am with a fresh set of wheels, new tires, and no one around to witness
my possible failure.

Well, after one false start I got the hang of it. Using only the rubber coated
end of a hammer and my sneaker coated feet I got the tires on. No pounding with
the hammer, just push with body weight. Use the tire lube stuff too.

The time to put in a new valve, mount &amp; seat tire and inflate was less then 5
min each. 4 min 28 sec actually. I suppose a tire machine is faster......  John
Henry would be proud.
