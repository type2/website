Subject: RE: Ezee Brake bleeder kit from IPD

I don't think so. Brake fluid is Hydroscopic (or is it hygroscopic?) By
definition. If you are using fresh brake fluid, the chance of introducing
enough moisture to saturate, or even seriously compromise the integrity, of
the brake fluid is minimal. You can only introduce a minimal amount of
water vapor from a tire using this method.  Not to mention that, if it is
easy to do a solo brake bleed job, your chances of actually DOING it are
greatly increased and your chances of actually having fairly fresh brake
fluid in your system are also increased. . 

But, if you like, one _could_ pump a dry innner tube full of helium or
anhydrous nitrogen and use that for a pressure source for this system ....
in the interest of being anal about the task. :-)

&gt;I have a question...
&gt;
&gt;How does this work? Using the air from a tire is scary. Why? Moisture.
Often
&gt;there is moisture in there. When you go put air in your tire, most
locations
&gt;will put moisture in there also. Will this not taint the brake system?
