Subject: [T2] Stupid Mistake? Follow up found rods upside down!!!!

&gt;Could the rods being upside down explain the problem of no compression?

Remove the top compression ring and see if it is installed correctly.
It is either marked TOP or it has a bevel on the inside circumference
which faces the top of the piston. Compression against this ring
forces the ring out sealing the cylinder. The second ring also has a TOP.
These must also be installed in the proper order, 1st ring, 2nd ring, etc.
