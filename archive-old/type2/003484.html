Jason-
Try Dupont ChromAllusions. It's $320 a pint ( wholesale )
or $3200 / gallon to the retail customer. Be sure to request
the Dupont Tech Data sheet for  specific application info.

&gt; Years ago I used Dupont Chroma-one paint to paint (of all things) an
&gt;electric guitar. Now in the next few weeks I plan on giving the still
&gt;unnamed 79 bus a good coat. Can anyone recommend/not this dupont product
&gt;or suggest any others that come to the market since I did this? I was
&gt;very happy with the results and the urithane finish is very tough. Seems
&gt;there might be some better paint developed over the past 5 or so years.
