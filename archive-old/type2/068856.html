Subject: Re; Inverted running, cont.

        Steven Dolan rightly points out:
&quot;the limit on inverted running is really the fuel supply.  The lube thing 
only matters for longevity.  Carbed engines won't run upside down for more 
than a second or two, whereas our injected engines will run for some 
minutes.  As a result, if you flip it, you actually have to turn
the engine off (not that it much matters at that point :-( &quot;

        Very bus-relivant!

        He's right of course- 10 or 30 second limits on inverted
operation of airplane engines are no doubt based on fuel pickup and
the risk of the engine stopping, not the oiling system. Guess I should
have my brain hosed off before it explodes...

        Extra credit off line- Making a carb work without gravity
helping is HARD. Name a famous instance and the kludgey solution.
