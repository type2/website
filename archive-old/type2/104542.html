&gt; &lt;would it be reasonably easy to do?
&gt; 
&gt; someone else on the list tell me if I am wrong but I think the answer 
&gt; is no!
&gt; I think I remember trying this - I had painted the carrier and it was 
&gt; not dry yet so on went the exhaust and in went the engine and .....
&gt; Later when I tried to slip the engine carrier between the exhaust - No 
&gt; go.

right the carrier cannot go on, but you can replace the motor mounts
without removing the carrier.
