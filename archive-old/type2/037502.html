Subject: Cool VW emblem I bought at Target....

All,

This is pretty much a Friday post, but we weren't
here.

I was at Target yesterday and happened to notice a
bunch of auto-related metal signs and...whoa! A VW
logo!! It's the round blue and white VW-logo
silk-screened on pressed tin (embossed) and measures
approx. 12&quot; across. It even has 2 holes (top and
bottom) for mounting. It cost $9.99 and is way cool,
IMHO.

I, of course, had to have one;-) My wife simply rolled
her eyes and asked what I was going to do with it. I
told her I wasn't sure. She said &quot;why not mount it on
the wall above the computer?&quot; and I'm thinking,
whoah...she actually wants me to put something VW
related in *THE HOUSE???* &quot;Sure,&quot; she says, &quot;then put
a little arrow beneath it that points to you and write
'I'm queer for Volkswagens'!!!&quot; *sigh* Oh, well.


I still don't know what I'm going to do with it, but
it sure looks cool;-)
