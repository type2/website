Subject: Stiff steering

Got a strange problem with the 70 westy:

The steering seems stiff at low speeds, especially after driving the bus
for a while. The only time I notice this is when I am going 20-30 mph over
crowned roads. When I move the steering wheel to keep the bus out of the
ditch, it seems to take a long time to catch up, and often I have to tug
harder than I think I should to make the correction.

I'm thinking steering box wear, as there is a slight clunking noise when I
grab the wheel and turn it side-to-side when the bus is parked. Could also
be a swing arm bushing, but I did the visual check on that and it seemed
okay.

I have an extra steering box in my 71 parts bus. Wondering if I should go
ahead and swap them out.
Bob
