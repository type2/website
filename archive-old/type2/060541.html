Jack,

Whether power from the headlight switch is transmitted to the low or high
beams is controlled by the headlight dimmer relay.  This is a sort of
(well, it may actually *be*) a latching relay.  The control wire is a
brown wire with a white trace that runs from the high-beam relay to the
switch on your column.  Each time this wire is grounded, it flops the
lights from the one state to the other.  I am willing to bet that either
this wire has developed a flaw in its insulation or that the switch has.
Since wiggling the wire bundle that contains the wire is causing a flop, I
am *almost* willing to bet money on a grounding problem in that wire (and
I am *almost* willing to bet money on sunrise as well, which shows you how
certain I need to be to bet money :-)  You trace that brown/white wire
from the dimmer relay up to the switch.  I think you will find a worn
spot on the insulation.  If not, then look at the switch.  There should be
continuity between it and ground (the sheet metal) *only* when you are
activating the switch!


General Rules:

Since I do a *lot* of work with 110V house current, where running a switch
in the ground side of things is an absolute no-no, I am amazed every time
I work on my car!

On 110V AC, black is power and white is ground (220V conventions may
differ, I don't know).  Since AC switches polarity 60 times per second,
this is *strictly* a convention!!!! But.... switches are *never* put in
the &quot;ground&quot; side, since this can leave you with a &quot;hot&quot; appliance.  Like
the case of your toaster, first thing in the AM, when you walk into the
kitchen in your damp bare feet!  If you work with much AC electricity,
putting the switch in the ground side is anathema!  Really bad!  Something
your teacher *BEATS* into you early on! And then.......

When you start working on VW's you find that *most* VW switches are
located on the ground side!  Amazingly, by VW's convention, all brown
wires (that I have discovered so far) are ground wires and should have
continuity to ground.  Brown wires with a color trace are switch wires
that should *not* have continuity, unless the switch is activated.  Wierd!
But of course, it's DC, not AC, and it's only 12V and you are unlikely to
die by shorting it.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
