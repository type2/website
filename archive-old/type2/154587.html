Subject: Re: [T2] It was running when I parked it...

&gt; SO, my question is for this Friday: Has this happened to any of you, or do
I
&gt; have a rare gift?


That is normal the owners get in over their heads, and try to get what it is
worth running out of it.

Bought a 1970 bug in april all the tires were flat, it was parked at the
back of the property, un molested though  Sunk in the dirt, good shape I
guess in my mind.    Pumped up the tires and drug it home.  Compression was
great, timing was a little off, fuel line was plugged up.  Fired it up, and
oh my gosh, it sounded like a socket was in the crank case getting bounced
around, turned out to be the #3 main bearing, it was no longer with us at
all.  I'm sure it was running when they parked it, but not very well.

$2000 later it is back on the road new pans, engine, hood, used beam, paint,
trim, brakes, tires, etc We now have a new to us ride in great shape, thanks
to all who blow them up and leave them alone for 10+ years, I 'll be happy
to come buy and pick them up for near nothing, and get them back on the road
to live somemore.


I have bought 2 vehicles in the past that &quot;ran when we parked it&quot; and I
think they were telling the truth, a little ether and a new to it battery,
gas, and 30 minutes later driving it home.  I always love the good scare
driving something home  that has been parked for so long brings.
