Subject: Re: [T2] Kadron Vacuum Source

Thanks for the advice, George.  I certainly wouldn't feel confident enough
to go tapping into a carb, especially not two of them!  I'll call Topline
and see what the cost is to have it done, IF I do it at all.  It's running
great right now with the carbs properly adjusted, and the timing set
correctly.

Thanks,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; The vacuum source for distributor vacuum isn't simply a passage to

&gt; of 
&gt; an attempt to simply drill a hole in the carburator.
