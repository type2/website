&lt;&lt;  Now take a deep breath and relax.  Keep in mind, having a bus is

more like being in a relationship than like owning a car.  You'll have

to work at it to make it successful.

Pop down to the local library and see if they have (or can get)
a copy of John Jerome's &quot;Truck&quot;...Not at all about VW's but
quite good as to the mind set needed to restore/rebuild/
just get running, an old vehicle...
After you read that, try &quot;Roadster&quot; by Chris Goodrich, about
a non-wrench who decides to build his own sports car...(Fans
of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; TV series probably already know the car... ;-)
