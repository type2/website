Subject: Re: Hitch prototype is now a hitch!

Marcus, are you saying that there were 2 different OEM hitches available?
I'm having trouble imagining how those bottom holes could be utilized as
any metal extending to them would make the bumper brackets no longer fit.
And if they could fit I would assume that new longer bolts would be
required for those bottom holes. Perhaps this beafier hitch was only
available in later years? Here are some pictures I took for Jamie of my
OEM hitch on my '71: http://la.znet_dot_com/~maryaedson/VWhitch/

This email has been rejected twice because of too much quoted material so
I guess I'll need to put in a bunch of blank lines to pass muster.

&gt;
&gt; Jamie,
&gt;
&gt; I have to admit that I did not look at your prototype pics. I have one
&gt; concern with the way your hitch is mounted. The OEM hitches used the
&gt; threads in the bottom of the frame rails (the bumper support mounts) and
&gt; the mounts in the sides of the frame rails (where your hitch is mounted)
&gt; were used in addition to the bottom mounts for high capacity hitches (75
&gt; instead of 50 kg tongue weight and more than 1200 kg towing capacity).
&gt; It may be worth contemplating to weld an additional angle iron to your
&gt; hitch that would allow you to utilizes the bottom mounts. In addition to
&gt; the extra mounting points the angle pieces would prevent the hitch from
&gt; pivoting around the side bolts. With your current design the bolts in
&gt; the sides of the frame rails have to carry all the weight and keep the
&gt; hitch from pivoting - lots of stress there. I had a couple of these
&gt; welded nuts brake loose on my hitch, but the design of the stock hitch
&gt; helped to prevent a major disaster. Had this happened with your design,
&gt; I would have screwed up one framerail end, my muffler, and the trailer
&gt; at the least ...
