Subject: RE: [T2] US source for AH Schofield parts? or another source
  for  gutters?

&gt;&gt; Does anyone know if there is a US source for
&gt;&gt; AH Schofield gutters or another  source
&gt;&gt; for replacements?

&gt; Isn't that where the busboys get their stuff?


You're probably thinking of us (Bus Depot); we carry some of Schofield's
replacement metal.  I don't have the gutters in stock but can check on them.
We have a shipment leaving the U.K. in a few weeks.
