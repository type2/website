Subject: difference between 914 tin and bus tin ?
Message-ID: &lt;439e1f9f.245daaa1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hey all,
quick question,

I got a 2l bus motor yesterday and the fellow had used it in a 914 for 
motivation for a while and had put 914 cooling tin on it ( he said ) -- is 
there a difference between 914 tin and &quot;regular&quot; bus tin ??

Thanks, Dan
