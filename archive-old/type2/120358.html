Subject: generator hookup

 howdy folks,
    i am very close to getting my bus on the road again. it will be the first time since it has been on the road under her own power since 1986!!!! my question to you all is, how do i hook up my regulator to the generator? my bus is a 1967, just so you know. i really need pictures, as they help me out a lot more than words, but anything will help me. thanks in advance,
josh
