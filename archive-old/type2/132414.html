Subject: unleaded fuel

Hi again,

One more question that popped to mind.  I think that the '79 engine (no 
cat) can use unleaded or leaded fuel.  On my old Land Rover, wisdom is 
to use Marvel Mystery or some other additive to protect the unhardened 
valve seats when using unleaded.  Is this necessary on our bus?

cheers,
joe and rachel broach
