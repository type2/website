&gt; I'm looking for some HD Bilstein shocks for a 77 camper. They seem to be
&gt; available for busses thru 8/76 and after 79.  Does anyone use Bilsteins on
a
&gt; 77 or 78.  Which part number? The archives show others asking the same
&gt; question, but no answer.

I am not sure why Bilstein does not show 77's. Maybe a misprint??
I looked in ETKA and VW says shock # 211 413 031R fits all fronts from 70 to
79. # 211 513 031R fits all rears from 72 to 79. Granted, these are VW part
numbers/shocks but they do not leave out 77.....
On another interesting observation: If anyone else has one of these CD's,
look up rear suspension, rear shocks, I think it was frame 42-00. Pictured
next to the standard shock is a coil-over shock!! Someone was saying the bus
was never designed to use coil-overs?? My 77 Westy has been doing fine with
them for over 75,000 miles....
