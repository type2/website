Subject: Windshield Wipers

Does anyone know if the picture (fig. 10-4 on page 31 of the Bently Service
Manual for 1968 - 1979 Type2) is correct?
  In the process of re-doing my '71 camper van I disassembled and
re-assembled
the windshield wiper motor and frame assembly.  Upon reassembly, I set the
drive
crank parking position according to instructions and the picture shown in
Fig. 10-4.  Now, when I turn the wipers on, they attempt to drive down
instead
of up.  If you look at Figure 10-10, which shows the proper position of the
wiper arms, you can see that driving down from the parking position is not a
good idea.  I have a spare assembly that I can look at to try to determine
where
I went wrong, but it appears to me that, in the parking position, the drive
crank
should be 180 degrees out from the way it is shown in Fig. 10-4.  At one
point
I thought maybe the drive motor was turning backwards, but from the spare
assembly that I have to look at, I can see that rotation direction of the
drive motor
or drive crank does not matter.  If I set the parking position as shown in
Fig. 10-4,
no matter which direction the drive crank moves in, it will drive the blades
down.
If I set the drive crank 180 degrees out from the way it is shown in Fig.
10-4, then
no matter which direction the crank moves in, it will drive the blades up as
it
should.  Oh, one other thing, Fig. 10-1 shows the motor and frame in
position
under the dashboard, and the drive assemply as shown, is in a position that
would
indicate that the drive crank is 180 degrees out from the way it is shown in
Fig. 10-4.
I would assume that the picture in Fig. 10-1 is shown with the drive crank
in the
parking position.  Has anyone else had this problem or is it me that is 180
degrees
out.  Thanks in advance.
