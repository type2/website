Message-ID: &lt;3738CF0E.DCE1B9B7_at_wpe_dot_com&gt;

Recently someone posted regarding a paint for the cast aluminum fan
housing - &quot;Alumablast&quot;?

What is it called? Who makes it? And most importantly, where do I find
it? No luck at my FLAPS.

(Archives not up to this point in time yet....)

Thanks.
