&gt; Let's keep it bay windows.

Hey Richard and guys   This coming from somebody that doesnt own a bay and 
isnt planning to    It doesnt matter I check both the bay and VB lists everyday 
and reply to both when I feel I can help   I have done enough work on all 
kinds of cars but grew up with VWs  These lists are the best going on    way too 
much BS on the samba where you have 15 year olds telling you how to fix this 
and that and their own bus is dead in the driveway  LOL The amount of knowledge 
is amazing on these lists and the Samba has its points also but I think a lot 
of them are missing out not repling or using the type2 lists    just my .02 
cents worth  later and have fun  Mark Dearing
