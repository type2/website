Subject: Re: Backing Plate Removal

Hi,

Rusted on tight but removed the plate. The bentley manual (that we found at
our local library) says that to remove the brake cable, just unscrew a bolt
but there is no bolt. I guess that is rusted in nicely too. Seems like it
should just slide out? My bus is a '68 if someone can let me know how to
remove the cable from the plate.

Also, is it possible to find a Bentley manual that actually shows a decent
about of info on my bus' year instead of a wide range of years where they
just touch on little bits? It's very frustrating. What should I be looking
for?

Thanks,
Jen :-)
