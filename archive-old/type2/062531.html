Subject: Brief trip report to Pisgah NC

I took the 81 camper and the two boys on a 400 mile round trip this past
weekend that included the Pisgah National Forest and the Blue Ridge Parkway
in NC. This is essentially the same area visited by &quot;Buses on the Blue Ridge&quot;
and is near Asheville which a number of people have commented on recently.

This is gorgeous country and is actually the first national forest in the
eastern US having been carved out of the Vanderbilt estate at Biltmore near
Asheville. I don't recall the size of the area but it was bought from the
estate for $5 an acre shortly after the turn of the century and later
benefitted from the depression era make-work projects such as the CCC etc.
Beautiful countryside and well used but by no means crowded. On the parkway,
which is a marvelous toy crossing several states under different names,
there's a 45mph limit and nobody in a particular hurry to get anywhere. Since
you're riding the spine of the mountain ridges there are always views to both
sides of the roads and plenty of turnouts. Since the parkway is not a means
of travel between two points, there's no one on it for any purpose other than
enjoying themselves. In a brief section we saw hikers, campers and climbers
all in a short distance from the road.

Saw one bay camper on the road and a plain water vanagon parked. None broken
down.

On the hundred miles or so of highway out of Atlanta, temps ranged about 210
to 230* with an outside temp of about 75 to 80* and speed generally about 55
to 60mph. Once on the two lane with rolling hills the temps fell to a more
consistent 215* which is real low for my experience in this thing. Further
when I headed up the mountains at 25 to 45mph with the auto mostly in second
I was amazed to find the temp more like 210 and it showed no ill effect from
the load at all. Granted the outside temp was now like 70* and damp but it
was working hard. Had about the same results all the way up to peak altitude
of 5,400 ft. It may have been my imagination, but I felt like once we got up
to around a mile high it seemed to be a little weezy. Home's about 1000ft,
would I expect to see a performance difference at that altitude?

Coming off the parkway we took a more direct(steep) route back to the valley
which consisted of putting it in second and dropping like a rock. Great fun.
Wilson in his book on rebuilding vw's recommended deceleration bouts to help
set the rings. I couldn't help but think that those rings were being sucked
on til they were blue!

I conclude with some puzzlement that this thing just doesn't like highway
time and nothing is going to change that. On the other hand it seems to
thrive on working hard on  roads that have to be driven rather than cruised.
That's where I'd rather be anyway but we don't always have the option of
avoiding the interstates if we want to get somewhere, do we? I also conclude
that as with pets, there is a serious question as to which is actually the
owner when dealing with vw's.

Finally, I recorded my best mileage ever on the highway with 15.5 mpg. The
hill climbing sessions only penalized this by about 2mpg. How can I have good
compression on all four, be timed correctly, have good clean plugs and
produce this kind of mileage which I guess should be more like 17/20 ? I am
about to succomb to the voodoo allure of premium. Ideas?

Anyway, marvelous part of the country which I recommend to anyone who can
include it  in a trip.
