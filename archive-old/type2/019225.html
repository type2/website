&gt; Hey.
&gt;  So, I'm thinking way in advance here, but I might be going to work in
&gt;  Colorado this summer for about two months.  I hear there's two or three
&gt;  little hills around there.
&gt;  
&gt;      So, here's my question.  Do I drive an automatic, or a standard?
&gt;  I'm scared to take my standard on any hills around here, because I don't
&gt;  want to stall it and roll backwards into other cars.  That's like, my
&gt;  worst fear.
&gt;      On the other hand, I hear the automatics suck, and might not pull me
&gt;  up the hill.  (also, do autos fail a lot?  I don't want to be driving
&gt;  cross country and be stuck because i drove an automatic bus.)
&gt;  
&gt;      So, let me know what you think.
&gt;  
Hi Dave,

Yes an auto bus will have less power to the wheels than a manual bus with the 
same engine, but its probably not enough to worry about.

Auto buses tend to have type 4 engines (1700, 1800 or 2000cc) so have lot 
more power than a USA spec 1600cc type 1 engined bus and manual transmission 
which would cope quite well.

Now I accept the mountains and hills in the UK are not quite so high as those 
in the USA but they are just as steep and I frequently take my current bus 
(and my previous 1600) up over 1 in 5(20%), 1 in 4(25%) and 1 in 3(33%) 
slopes. 
The steepest public road in the UK with a gradient of 1 in 2.2(45%) - and 
that's pretty damn steep - is just a mile from my house so hill starts are 
part of everyday driving around here. [going from the flat road at the top 
down the hill is like driving off the edge of the world]

Going up steep hills you would be using 1st and 2nd gear a lot - but with an 
auto you would probably be selecting 1st and second anyway. Going up hill you 
match the gear and throttle to the speed you want to go at just the same as 
on the flat.

Going down hill you need to save the brakes and there is much truth and 
wisdom in the addage that you should only go down a hill in the same gear as 
you would drive up that hill - use engine braking to stop your brakes burning 
up.

Weather driving an auto or manual you still need to judge how much gas to 
apply - hill starts without stalling are purely a matter of practice. Find a 
quiet spot on a steep hill near you and have a go. Do it somewhere where if 
necessary you can roll back, turn around and drive off to come back another 
day. I remember stalling at least 6 times at one junction when I was learning 
to drive....

Once you have the knack its actualy quite difficult to roll backwards as you 
balance the clutch and gas pedals with the hand brake on, when the van is 
just trying to move forward, keep the pedals still, release the hand brake 
(keep your hand on the brake just in case) appling a tiny bit more gas then 
gently releasing the clutch as you apply more gas. Of course with an auto you 
have only one pedal to balance the van with which could make life easier.

If you stall before you release the hand brake then you won't roll back. If 
you stall as you move the pedals after releasing the hand brake its amazing 
how fast you can press the brake pedal or pull the hand brake....

Of course if your hand brake won't hold you on a 1 in 3 then its time to get 
it fixed.

Dont practice too much at any one time as you will end up overheating the 
clutch plate and burning off the friction surface - practice little and often 
on gradualy steeper hills.

Practice, build up confidence, and take which ever bus is mechanicaly more 
sound and you will find the VW bus is just as wonderfull on the hills as on 
the flat as it keeps chugging along long after you think it will give up.

I'm sure we all look forward to hearing your trip report at the end of the 
summer.

Good luck
