Subject: Re: [T2] DMV woes....

&gt; Instead of getting regular car (or truck) plates, Ms. DMV hands me
&gt; &quot;motorhome&quot; plates.  She tells me that because it can be used as a
&gt; &quot;temporary dwelling&quot;, it is now classified as a motorhome.

My insurance agent with State Farm would not let me &quot;add on&quot; my '78
Westfalia to my Jeep's existing policy.

He said becuase the Westfalia is officially considered a motor home by the
insurance industry, I had to buy a separate/second policy, and could not
list it as a &quot;second vehicle&quot; on my Jeep's policy.

I have not stopped by the DMV yet to register my recent purchase, but your
encounter with &quot;Ms. DMV&quot; doesn't seem out of line to me.
