&gt;
&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;    Sorry to clog up the servers with this but I don't know all the LiMBO
&gt;Members e-mail address's and since most subscribe to the lists I figured
&gt;why not.   Who knows maybe someone else may be interested in this info as
&gt;well.  If anyone is going to Searsport this weekend please let me know.  As
&gt;of right now I'm going but if Hurricane Hortense comes up the coast... who
&gt;knows.  Take care.

&gt;&gt;Hi L.i.M.B.O.
&gt;&gt;       We have met many of your members over the years at Toronto or down
&gt;&gt;in the U.S. and we are looking
&gt;&gt;forward to seeing many of you again this weekend. Good to hear that there
&gt;&gt;will be a good turnout this year,
&gt;&gt;hopefully the wet weather scheduled will turn into glorious sunshine just
&gt;&gt;for us. If any Westfalias are
&gt;&gt;travelling this week we would love them come and join our small group from
&gt;&gt;Ontario, Canada as we camp across
&gt;&gt;the U.S. on our way to Searsport, if you are free from Wednesday....if not
&gt;&gt;join us 'en route' on the road or
&gt;&gt;at the campsites, the plans so far............
&gt;&gt;BUSES-BY-THE-BOUY  Searsport, Maine USA -13th, 14th &amp; 15th September 1996
&gt;&gt;The Ontario Westfalias Owners Travel Club (W.O.T.C.) trip to MAINE USA
&gt;&gt;starts Wednesday 11th September at noon
&gt;&gt;from Kingston. Our Westfalia 'wagon train' will travel up the 401 crossing
&gt;&gt;St. Lawrence at Prescott and into
&gt;&gt;New York State. Following a easterly route across the Adirondack mountains
&gt;&gt;along Highway 11 to Burlington,  we
&gt;&gt;plan to eat at the New England Culinary Institutes &quot;The Inn at Essex&quot; and
&gt;&gt;camp for the night at Lone Pines
&gt;&gt;campsite nearby (Canadian at par.in the campsite). After a hearty
&gt;&gt;breakfast on Thursday we travel down I-89 to
&gt;&gt;Montpelier and take Highway 2 into Maine. Camping Thursday night is at
&gt;&gt;Augusta KOA for $5-00 per person. (What
&gt;&gt;a deal!) Friday starts early (9am) due to the rendevous in Augusta with a
&gt;&gt;large contingent of Westfalias from
&gt;&gt;all over the Eastern part of the United States and Canada. Hopefully, more
&gt;&gt;canadians (at least 3) will show up
&gt;&gt;from New Brunswick again!
&gt;&gt;The Official camping weekend will start Friday as the 'Armada' of VW's
&gt;&gt;leaves for the trek to Searsport where
&gt;&gt;we will camp all weekend. Many more campers will trickle in Friday and
&gt;&gt;Saturday. This a fun weekend with lots
&gt;&gt;to see, do and eat. Please join our 'International' convoy or go your own
&gt;&gt;way, in any case you will enjoy one
&gt;&gt;of the East coasts favourite Westfalia events of the year. This is
&gt;&gt;expected to be the biggest
&gt;&gt;'Buses-by-the-bouy' turn out than any other year.
&gt;&gt;.....Bye for now.   Eddy &amp; Lilian  Westfalia Owners Travel Club - Ontario
