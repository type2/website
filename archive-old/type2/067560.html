Subject: Gas Heater Question

Hi,

I just managed to get my BN2 gas heater going.

I built it from scratch from a bunch of BN2's I had kicking
around.

Now the question:  What does one look for in a good combustion
chamber?  I examined several, and finally picked the cleanest
one. 

I had one that was a write-off, the sensor mount came right out.

The others just had more carbon on the inside.

Thanks for any info,
...Markus
