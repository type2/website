Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic Ignition Woes

I couldn't get it to work on my 80 vanagon, so there is a problem. The
distributor is sending me a new unit and claims that a 2 ohm ballast
resistor attached to the + side of the coil will fix the problem. Maybe. I'm
really starting to have my doubts about this product, hearing your problems.
I too have a complete, new working ignition system.

&gt; I'm trying Hot Spark but having issues getting it to work. The guys

&gt; Anybody have similar problems with Pertronix or Compufire or HS? Poor
&gt; idle and opening the trottle does absolutely nothing. I've tried 3
&gt; distributors, 3 rotors, 2 caps, 2 coils, added a 2ohm ballast
&gt; resistor, etc etc etc... Coil resistances are 3.1 and 3.9 (original
&gt; stock black/orange Bosch, Bosch Blue, respectively).
&gt; 
&gt; Note this is NOT a dis against Hot Spark. I think the HS and The Guac
&gt; just don't want to get along.
