No, the point of point opening is controlled by the dizzy cam. It is 
actually cut back 3 degrees on no. 3, which makes it essential to install 
the drive gear properly timed, so you have no. 1 mark on the dizzy in 
proper orientation for both no 3 retard on the cam 180 degrees opposite no. 
1 and no issues with the vacuum pot hitting anything, having sufficient 
clearance both sides of proper timing point. However, always best to make 
sure you have the stock dizzy so that stock orientations are correct. You 
can reset the drive gear to provide for any of a bunch of dizzies the will 
fit the interface. Whatever you use, you should surely verify the advance 
cures to make sure you are in the neighbor hood of the stock specs for your 
engine.

Between 72 and 78 T-IV engines in T-II's, VW lists 14 or so different 
dizzies. Many variations of year, manual or automatic, CA or FED specs, 
etc. If you review the advance tables, you will see they all have very 
similar, only slightly differing curves. None of them vary more than 2 
degrees from each other at any rpm. Bosch lists 11 different dizzies for 
this series, but few no.'s are currently available new, in fact only one 
called for any T-II/T-IV. The No. is 022 905 205 S and was listed at 
$350+.  If you can't find the stock dizzie for your's, ANY in this series 
will work very nicely thank you, even swapping between carbed and/or FI 
dizzies either way. Whether you set it up with advance vacuum only or use 
retard vacuum as well. Mallory makes a fully adjustable curve item for 
these. These simply MUST be checked and adjusted to verify the curve. They 
are the only way to go if you are building a one off racing or other 
specialized motor in a non spec mode.

So, if you got an 009 or other WRONG CURVED dissie in there, make a photo 
copy of the Lists of dizzies in the Bentley to take to the salvage yards 
and flea markets and auto jumbbles and find one on the list with bright and 
shinny cam lobes and tight shaft and good a vacuum diaphram. Shoot, I've 
found $550 Porsche and MB 4 cly cast iron dizzies for $35. Their curves are 
quite close to the T-IV VW specs, and a far better match than any 009 or 
T-I curve. The Porsche will have the no 3 retart cam. The MB will not. The 
most wonderful thing about these 50's and 60's cast iron dizzies is, they 
are easily rebuilt, and many have adjustable advance weights.

In my Porsche I have a MB 190 dizzie with the no. 3 lobe worked back 3 
degrees with abrasives then polished. Remarkably, the curve was right and 
needed no adjustment. Proof of function via seat of the pants. Very strong 
clean pulling under heavy throttle from 2000 rpm to redline.
