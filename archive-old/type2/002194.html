Subject: Re: [T2] Asbestos in heater system?

Steve,

I performed the 'stunt' of opening up my heater boxes and cleaning them out.
I have a 77 that has been in the rust belt most of its life, but has not
seen much of winter driving. The heater boxes held up fine - you don't
actually have to open the crimps up all the way, jug a bit so that they can
be popped apart. The are a couple of spot welds that hold the 2 halves
together - near the air exit end - I clipped thru that area with a tin-snip.
After wetting down the insides (to keep the asbestos from becoming airborn)
I ripped out the metal layer and asbestos pad - then cleaned out any residue
with a wire brush.

The purpose of the metal layer and asbestos pad are to keep the hot fins of
the exhaust from burning thru the metal jacket. In hopes of keeping mine
from burning thru too easily, I places an extra layer of sheet metal where
the asbestos was - only time will tell how well this will work.

I didn't know when I started this project that there was an asbestos pad on
the top/botton of each exchanger - I was simply trying to degrease the
inside of my heater boxes since I had a lot of oil blowing around in my
previous engine!

There is also an asbestos ring *inside* the black plastic tubes that run
from the boxes to the body.

I personally don't believe that asbestos that is disturbed every time the
engine is removed can be considered 'undisturbed'. The stuff in the heater
boxes is probably constanlty flaking apart simply from vibration/air
movement *and* as the heater boxes decay over time. I chose to remove all
the asbestos that I came across. I haven't replace the tubes that connect
engine/body yet, but will probably run flexible exhaust as replacement - I
used this on bugs a few times and it works well, but does transfer a fair
amount of engine noise.

Just thought I'd share my recent experience on this subject.
