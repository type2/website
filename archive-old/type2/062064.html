Heard the same thing, nice guy, clean shop, for 140.00 you get a life  
time alignment, just bring it back.  I asked him is they do VW's, he  
growned, said they do, but they that they were a real pain..

Ben Said:

&gt;. Then he informed me that &quot;they just don't line well,&quot; and that's why  
they didn't do alignments on VW's, Renaults, or BMWs.
