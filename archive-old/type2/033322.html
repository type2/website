&gt; can't help you with other real questions, but
&gt; 
&gt; Station wagon = Kombi = VIN of 23something.

Not quite.  A station wagon has a full passenger interior and a VIN of
22x-xxx...  In the US, most of them came with deluxe exterior trim as
well.

A Kombi has a more Spartan interior and a VIN of 23x-xxx...  Kombis
were also the basis of the campmobile.
