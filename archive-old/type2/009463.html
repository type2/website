Want to extend a good bye to everyone on the list as I am off for the
month of June, like our list master.  Unfortunately, unlike Steve,  I
will not be driving my Vanagon.  It's together and running, but it needs
some sorting out.  It should be all set Monday, but 5 days or so of
running after my first re-build and then setting out on a 6,000 mile trip
doesn't sound like a smart idea, especially with the family. 

 Thanks to everyone who helped answer my questions.  It really hurts to
not take the van.  It also hurts to pay some others to work on it before
realizing, I should of held off getting it on the road - would have also
allowed me time to get my car together by myself, oh oh the car repair
bills this Month could make me cry.  Tom- good luck with those engines -
Steve, have a good trip &amp; I wish you  good fortune. Al - keep dispensing
that level headed advice - wish I had time to see the rusty-trusty double
cab.   I'll be back in July.  Anyone on route from Mass to Wyoming wants
to extend a camping spot in their backyard -p-mail me.
