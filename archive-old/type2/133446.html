&gt; &quot;This list is only about AIRCOOLED Volkswagen Transporters, Vanagons
&gt; and Caravelles, model years 1968 through 1983. If you have an earlier
&gt; bus, or a WATERCOOLED bus, you are on the wrong list.&quot;

what about a water cooled vanagon that had a 2liter aircooled engine
transplanted into it???
