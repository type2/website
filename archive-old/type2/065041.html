&gt; 
&gt; How the heck do you get those tin screws off?  All came off no problem
&gt; except for about four which I have yet to budge.  I'm squirting liquid
&gt; wrench like holy water but nothing.  What's the best method; an impact
&gt; screwdriver or are there any hints which can unbind them.  My second

Use a small pair of vise grips (5&quot; long), grip the head of the screw - a 
little more than snug, but not smashing - and twist the vise grips. 
Should come right off!!

hope this helps
