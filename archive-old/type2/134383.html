Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

I didn't see anyplace on the MS website offering assembled units, but I 
didn't spend very long digging. But the estimated $130 cost is very 
attractive. I inherited the GEX because the PO had replaced the stock FI 
with a weber progressive and couldn't pass smog when they got to Calif. When 
they asked the local VW shop how much to restore to stock FI, they were told 
over $1200 in parts alone.

Megasquirt can be a bit intimidating before you get over the learning
curve, but I certainly wouldn't be *afraid* of it.  I've come away from
my reading up on it that it's a very good system ... and it's certainly
inexpensive!

&gt;  Does anyone sell a complete solution?

Define &quot;complete&quot;.  You're going to need some of those D-Jet components
to use Megasquirt... the plenum (which you'll have to modify slightly;
it will need to be fitted with the MAP sensor), the intake runners, and
the injectors themselves (you'll probably want bits of the D-Jet wiring
harness, too).  Other than that, the Megasquirt web site has info about
where assembled units can be purchased, I think.
