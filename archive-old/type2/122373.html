&gt; What's everyone using as for battery rating (cranking amps) in there Buses?  I

Are you sure that's not 1000 CA _at_32F? Otherwise that's an awful lot of
energy for a battery that can still fit in your engine compartment.

The smaller size 42 battery will be around 450 CCA. The larger, standard for
a bus, size 41 battery will have a much higher rating: 40-50% more typical.
