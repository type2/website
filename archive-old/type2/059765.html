Subject: Tubing for tent frame

Volks,

I recently bought Barry Burneskis' tent.  The tent canvas is excellent,
but the frame has a couple of small problems.  As a result I would like to
replace two of the corner pieces.  I know a shopp that can do the bending/
welding, if I can get them the tubing, but I gotta say, so far no luck. 
Does anyone know of a source for that tubing???

I took a micrometer to it and the OD of the tube is .877&quot;, necked down to
.75 at the joints. Now given the source, I would expect that the tubing
was metric diameter, so I did the conversion and it comes out at 22.28mm.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
