Subject: [T2] single cab gas heaters?

It just takes it to long to thaw out the windshield on start up. I was hoping 
that there is a gas heater made to mount in the engine bay but blow only into 
the caped off side of the fork at the rear end of the heater tube so it goes 
right to the windshield in my sc. all of the bus heaters I've seen have had 
the vent for the rear passenger compartment. Or can I safely modify a bus 
heater? 
thanks
