Subject: Re: [T2] climbing on board or jumping off the deep end

I found my father-in-law a Buick that had been a small town local car with 
low miles. As soon as he got it to Chattanooga and put it into daily 
service at interstate speeds it developed a rash of minor problems like 
water pumps, hoses, brakes, etc.

The car only had 75K miles on it.

Took a while to get past those trips to the local mechanic and then all was 
well.

He got the itch after a year or two for a p/u so he bought a used p/u and 
sold the Buick.

This is the type of problems I would expect from one of those VW Westies 
that has 14K miles on it and is selling for $15K.

&gt;Funny, I would have argued the exact opposite.  :)  There was a guy in the 
&gt;paper the other day with a '92 accord with over a million miles on it, and 
&gt;it still drove &quot;like a new car&quot;.  Personally, from a reliability 
&gt;standpoint I will take a newer, high-mileage vehicle any day over an 
&gt;older, low-mileage one.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;IMHO, for the average owner it's better not to inherit the original brakes,
&gt;&gt;rotors, cv boots, gas tank, fuel lines, paint, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Suddenly, I agree with you.  :)  But with our busses, it's really not 
&gt;important as you either get an old bus with low miles, or an old bus with 
&gt;high miles.  And in this case, the old bus with low miles is of course 
&gt;preferable.
