Subject: RE: Unknown knob on '69 westy dash

&gt; On my 68 and 71s the farthest left knob is for parking/headlights.
&gt; Pulls out once for parking and twice for headlights.
&gt;

Me thinks the knob in question is farther left: peradventure it's the
switch what be wired in series with the rear dome light. It enables the
driver to turn off the rear light without having to stand up and walk
back there.

(Think about that last sentence: how many people can stand up and walk
in a car that's about an inch longer than a Honduh Cnivic? Only us
chosen few!)
