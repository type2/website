&gt; This week I saw an outpouring of support for a fellow list member.  
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;  It restored a huge amount of
&gt; faith in America for me.  There was a great outpouring of appreciation for
&gt; what I was doing.  So many of these people remain my dear friends even now,
&gt; a year and a half after my trip has ended.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; The Idea so far:
&gt; These are just some of the thoughts I have.
&gt; 
&gt; We could build a website that lists names, addresses, e mails, and
&gt; specifics of experience whether it be type 4 engine or just 1600 engines or
&gt; both.  For example we could list on this site whether listies know FI or
&gt; just carbs.  Also for travelers from the list that are posting those ever
&gt; appreciated trip reports we could offer a monetary pledge service that
&gt; could provide a specified amount of pledge funds for folks on the road that
&gt; might need it.  Of course those funds would be pledged by members of the
&gt; BPRS.
&gt; 
&gt; The BPRS site would also include the most useful travelers post like a
&gt; complete &quot;spare parts list&quot;; How to use the local library to communicate
&gt; with the list; Good mechanics around the country that have assisted list
&gt; members in the past; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; For a member to be eligible for funds through the group they would have to
&gt; have been on the list for one year (confirmed) and would have to be a
&gt; particpating party on the list.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about the rules of engagement if you think this is a good idea.  If
&gt; we get enough people we might even set up a comittee of members that would
&gt; judge the cause for funding eligibility.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell me what you think.  I am asking for input and involvement here.  The
&gt; &quot;Bus Pilots Rescue Squadron&quot; website could be a possibility but then it may
&gt; not be.  I await your input anxiously.  In fact the $50.00 I just pledged
&gt; to Steve will be doubled and pledged to this group if it does come to
&gt; fruition.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this stupid or worth thinking about???
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for tolerating these benevolent ramblings,

Charlie:
Sorry to be so late in joining this discussion. I basically agree with
your ideas. I think the first such support network that I'd heard of was 
the BMWMOC (Motorcycle Owners Club). They have a book called Anonymous
or something and the listees are only listed by city and first name and
what they can offer. There's some merit to the anonymity. It takes away
the possibilities of having the list used for purposes other than the
original intent. (Ever hear of SPAM?)
I'm personally not very shy or reclusive but everyone has their own
limits and I fear that with a web-based public list we'd have a lot less
volunteers.
Still, I'd support most anything you want to do. It sure woulda helped
me a few times!
