Subject: speaking of gas cap mishaps...

I remember driving from Chester VA to Johnson City TN over the summer
and filling up at a gas station near Roanoke, off of exit 150A on 81. 
Cheapest gas around :) .  Anyway, I got gas and off I went.  I later
stopped at Waffle House for dinner, near Virginia Tech and continued on
my way, stopping eventually at a rest area maybe 100 miles or less from
the TN-VA line (I don't remember exactly, but it was a long way from the
gas station).  I got out to stretch, walked over the passenger side of the
bus and noticed that my gas cap was missing!!  Then I looked up in the
rain gutter (where I always keep my cap when I fill up) and saw it in the
gutter right above the rear hatch!!!!  

Now, I had been driving on the interstate and in the pouring rain and
nothing had dislodged that cap from the roof.  Of course, who knows
how much water made its way into my gas tank, but I never had any
missing or other symptoms of water in the fuel.  I was glad I still had it
too, because it's from RMMW, original style, and costs around $10, I had
bought it not too long ago.  PO put a locking gas cap on after someone
stole the original.  

Anyway, the moral of the story:  make sure you put the freakin' gas cap
back on!  And if you forget, at least put it in the rain gutter where it will be
safe :)
