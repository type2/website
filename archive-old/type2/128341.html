&gt; HEY,

&gt; I have a 71 with a type 1 engine, and have looking for an original muffler.
&gt; The person at the store told me he he would recommend a Beetle muffler,
&gt; because it helps the engine breath more.

Yes, it will fit a bay with no modifications to the bumper or the rear
valence, at least it did on my '71.

IIRC, splitties needed the valence
and bumper cut for the peashooters.  We have one very nice splittie
driving around my town with two inverted-V shaped cuts in the rear bumper
for the exhaust (*sob*).

Like I said, I did it, didn't have any problems with fumes coming in the
rear hatch (which has a good seal) but also didn't get any power increase.
The last time I had the engine out, I repleced it with a Leibstritz bus
muffler and tailpipe.

My best advice about mufflers is to buy a quality part, like Leibstritz,
and avoid the cheapie Mexican parts.  The time you spend getting a Mexican
muffler to fit your bus will more than pay for a quality muffler, and the
quality muffler will likely last longer.
