Subject: Rear Stub Axle Questions

Volks,

Back in June, while I was driving across the US, I had a rear wheel
bearing failure.  In LA I went out to Pick Your Part (I LOVE CA
junkyards!!!) and pulled a rear bearing carrier and stub axle assembly.  I
installed this and was on my way.  Yesterday, I tore the dead one down and
have a couple of questions.

1. I am 99% sure the stub axle and hub are toast.  Although, there is no
obvious damage, it went a good many miles (probably 500-1000) with the
axle nut loose and the inner race of the bearing fractured. I have
sensible play between the hub and splines on the stub.  Dead, yes?

2. When I drove out the outer bearing, I discovered that there is no lip
on the inner end of the housing!!!  All my experience in driving bearings
in is to press 'til it hits a lip.  The Bentley's says nothing of this,
just &quot;drive in the new bearing&quot;.  The old bearing was flush with the
housing at its outer edge, so I guess that is how deep I will drive the
new one, but how wierd!!!

3.  Any tips on getting the big circlip out from the inner bearing?  I
don't own a circlip pliers that big and I am pretty sure I don't want to.
Looks like a Snap-on $200 tool :-)
