Subject: RE: [T2] 80 MPH Type 2

&gt;Wow, I didn't know my post was going to generate such traffic! Nothing
&gt;like stirring the pot. In addition to the Corvair engine and tranny, my
&gt;69 has 71 vacuum assisted brakes.

There was a fellow that had modified vented rotors up front and solid discs 
out back on a Vanagon. In my dreams!!!!
