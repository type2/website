Subject: Value of '77 Westy for parts?

I have recently purchased a non-running '78 Westy (hopefully only a 
stuck lifter), and have run across a non-running '77 Westy that
would be good for parts.  What is the net-wisdom on a value for
the vehicle?  Here are the facts:

Body decent original with mild rust-through in the usual places

Sink &amp; poptop only setup

Eberspacher heater in very original condition (everything looks
to be there)

Dual jalousie windows

Canvas w/ no tears, interior in good original condition, dash good 
condition.

Engine looks clean, and owner says it will run but only on three
cylinders (he thinks it is a burnt valve).

Cabinets are worn but are solid and all present.

I was thinking $500 might be a reasonable offer.  Any other opinions?

Thanks,
