&gt;Hello Folks,
&gt;     Doing some touch ups on the chassis last night with POR 15 (while I've 
&gt;got things removed for the beam replacement access is easier) and I came 
&gt;across the junction box for the heat ducts, which was wrapped in a rubber 
&gt;jacket that was lined with a white woven material, is this sucker asbestos?

Jeff:

I believe it is indeed Asbestos, unless some PO found a creative way to put some other fibrous cloth in there instead.
