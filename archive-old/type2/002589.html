Hey Gentery..

I set my timing a couple of weeks ago to 30 deg. total advance at 2000rpms.
I have a timing light.  I will check the vacuum ports ( I think I have a
vacuum gauge).. If not, I'll get one..

Dwell is right at 50 deg., so I think that's fine.  And it runs and
accelerates pretty smoothly.  The idle isn't rough.

Hypothetically speaking, if one of the vacuum ports spoke of a bad diaphram
in the dizzy, would that lead to overheating (advance), or perhaps the
stalling on deceleration (retard)?

This would be a great thing if true.  And solve many of my problems with a
$55 investment.  Provided the 009 is a good dizzy for my engine...
(yikes!!! I hear the two armies approaching now)

Cheers,

Tom

first chect your timing and dwell, if the cooler was
cloged you would have locked up by this time
also check your valve clearence
if your oil relief valves were stuck than you would blow the cooler any
oil leak would show up quickly with the oil light. overheatingis usually
from the dist. not adjusted to spect.
also find a vac. tester check both ports on
vac on dist. if either one cannot hold a vac.
replace it with a 009 dist if they hold vac
take dist cap off and see if the plate moves
when vac punp is used.the vac. pump is a
small hand held unit not the ac vac pump
if your vac unit on disc. is bad you could
be running on full advance let me know
what you find and well go from there.
