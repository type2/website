Not grease, Patrick, light oil. Sewing machine oil, like 5 weight. Most
hardware store have what's called a Zoom Spout Oiler. That's what I use.
ATF is also acceptable. 2 or 3 drops. Get a spark plug thread chaser and
clean up the head thread. Use the grease on the thread chaser to capture
any crud so it won't fall into the head.

If you check the archives you will see I warned of this problem with
anti-seize several times in the past. Even if you use a small amount of
anti-seize, after about the third time it builds up into a problem unless
you chase the threads every time. Why add time/money to a simple repetitive
maintenance procedure?

&gt;Hello,
&gt;    I wasn't going to further the thread but... I just removed a spark
plug that I had put too much anti-sieze on and I almost cried as I tried to
move it. I had to heat the engine just to move it. When I finally got it
out the threads were jammed with the stuff. From now on its grease for me.
Anyone else run into this? By the way I use anti-sieze on everything else.
