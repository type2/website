Subject: Dichtflachen reinigen

Well, later today. But the Loctite 574 is in hand, with directions in 
German and a bottle suited for a giantess's nail polish.

Meanwhile, a word of thanks for interchangeable machine parts, an early 
nineteenth century American invention cunningly appropriated by German 
engineers and manifest in the fact that you don't have to number every 
darned bolt and nut. You can mix them up a little and everything works 
out in the end.
