Subject: Re: [T2] Sealing a Hightop(converted)

ok guys i might get some permatex and lift the roof a bit and set it down on something to hold it up there (all i need is it lifted a couple inches) so i can put the permatex around where it was sitting and where screw holes are.... then set it back down and make sure it is lined up with holes and tighten down....
   
  should glue it sealed.....i hope...once i screw back in .... those self tappers will hold on the second go round wont they?
   
   
  now to find something to stick under the roof to hold it up a little ways while i get outside on the ladder...
  fun fun fun..
   
  thanks everyone....
