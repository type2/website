Subject: Re: [T2] black crud coming off my 1970's steering wheel


Epoxy paint would work real good in this situation.

But another easy solution, while costing a bit more, would simply
purchase a leather wheel skin.

About a 5 minute installation.

NICE !!

Later,

Terry

Going to clean mine with mineral spirits and then a very quick clean
with lacquer thinner (to remove any oily mineral spirits) and then plan
to respray using the color that matches my dash. 
IF I am correct this should seal the failing steering wheel vinyl /
rubber/ what-ever-it-is stuff. 
I'll update the list on the results. I should be doing this is weekend. 
By the way, my grandfather's 1995 Lumina has done something similar.
