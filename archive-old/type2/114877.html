Subject: RE: [T2] Carb Replacement

This is the same road that I think I will follow, but I have questions. I
believe that it is recommended that you use a 009 distributor with these
carbs. It says this on the CBperformance website. I have heard from one list
member, that has this setup, and says that the 009 works great with these
new style &quot;stock&quot; carbs. 

What does the list think about this? I have heard so many bad stories about
this distributor, but all I see for sale is this distributor? Do they not
produce enough vacuum to use the old distributor? If they do not, then am I
going to be happy with the 009?

Thanks,
Corbett


&quot;Buy the duel Solex 34 pdsit's from CB Performance. You will like them much
better then the Webers and they have chokes and a vaccum port for the dizzy.
