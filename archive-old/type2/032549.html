Paul and All;

One difference is that prior to the speed limit reductions imposed in the '70s 
as &quot;fuel conservation measures&quot;, drivers had years of experience driving at 
speeds of 70 MPH and higher (often MUCH higher).  Cruise control wasn't 
universal, so it was necessary to actually DRIVE the vehicle and as the result 
they paid a certain amount of attention to the job at hand and what was 
happening around them.

I remember a cross-country trip in 1959, driving a 1934 Chevy coupe.  It would 
happily go 90 MPH+ -- the power was there, but the bearings were poured babbit 
and totally inadequate for such speeds and loads.  At one stage I found myself 
on a toll turnpike with a MINIMUM speed limit of 70 MPH and a top limit of 85 
MPH (totally unenforced, by the way) and no way to get off for nearly 150 
miles.  I tried to run just above 70, but that wasn't possible.  All vehicles 
in all lanes were cruising merrily along between 85 and 90.  The result was a 
set of rod bearings fried.

In Washington State the authorities decided to &quot;improve&quot; on the newly imposed 
National speed limit by dropping the limit to 50 MPH, even on Interstate 
highways.  The accident rate skyrocketed.  Drivers accustomed to traveling at 
70 or 75 became inattentive at 50, and the pileups were horrendous.  The 
&quot;authorities&quot; speculated that at 70 MPH most drivers were a bit on edge, 
sensing a bit of risk/danger, and thus drove more safely.  When the 
&quot;edgeiness&quot; was removed, sloppiness and inattention caused havoc.  Ultimately 
the State authorities, with great reluctance, raised the limit to the 
breakneck speed of 55 MPH.

Another difference is just sheer volume of traffic.  In the '50s and '60s I 
could routinely drive from Tacoma, WA to Portland, OR in 2 hours, even though 
the &quot;freeway&quot; was mostly 4 lanes and most intersections were level rather than 
overpasses and cloverleafs.  The posted limit was 70 MPH.  Now the freeway 
(I-5) is all &quot;controlled access&quot;, much of it is 6 or even 8 lanes, and the 
speed limit doesn't get up to 70 until South of Olympia, WA.  Making the 
Portland trip in under 3 hours is uncommon, and under 2:30 impossible.

A more graphic example is this...

I've been driving from Tacoma to California for around 40 years, in everything 
from a &quot;breathed on&quot; 1970 Datsun 2000 Roadster (5-speed trans.) to VW buses.  
My all time fastest trip between Tacoma and Redding, CA was made in 1963 in a 
Renault Dauphine (3-speed transaxle).  The &quot;freeway&quot;, such as it was, ended at 
Cottage Grove, OR and resumed S. of Mt. Shasta, CA.

Right up to the present the closest I've been able to come to that '63 trip 
still took an hour longer, on a multi-lane freeway (I-5 all the way), driving 
a very healthy Accord with a 5-speed.  I was responding to a &quot;family 
emergency&quot; situation and in full-bore &quot;press on regardless&quot; mode.

FWIW.....
