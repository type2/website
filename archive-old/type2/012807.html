X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

I lost your address. But to answer your question.
The Hammerite product I use is sold as &quot;Rustcap&quot;.
My local Hardware store now carrys it in white/green/blue/
aluminum/gold...etc etc. Also comes in spray cans. I opt.
for the brush on as even with that you have to have good 
ventilation. This stuff appears to be almost a epoxy based
paint with different materials in suspension. The white is
filled with &quot;glass flakes&quot; that they say settle and
interlock... I assume the metalic stuff is the same. At any
rate. Once applied.... its there for the duration. Water
has absolutly no effect on it. It has a gloss finish and
conforms to whatever is under it. So if you want a smooth
finish you have to insure the surface is smooth. They claim
you can paint over rust...  etc etc. If you sand it, wear a mask!
