Subject: I fried 2 starters WHY?

Engine is a 1700 with dual carbs.  It is currently OUT of the bus, but i have it connected to an old transmission and starter in my garage.  I have been trying to start it this way.  I connect positve battery terminal to the big post on the starter and the Positive side of the coil. I ground everything (tranny &amp;  engine) by connecting to the negative battery post.  Then I connected a wire to the small terminal on the starter where the ignition switch normally goes, when I touch the other end of this wire to the positive battery terminal it should turn and try to start the engine, right? Well, it did turn over the engine at first, but kinda slow.  However, after a coupla times the starter motor stopped turning but the solenoid would continue to click. So I replaced the strter with a KNOWN good one, and same thing!! worked a few times, then the starter stopped working.  Why is this not working???

Peace, John Baker
