&gt; Camper interior is different.  I prefer the '76-'79 layout.
&gt; '75 also had a 1.8L engine, and lots of one-year-only parts, IIRC.


There are not many one-year-only parts on the '75 that I can think of
offhand. (Most of those that I can think of that are different, with the
exception of interior camper parts, are either not common failure items
or are readily available anyway.) And the real-world performance
difference between the 1.8L and the 2.0L is minimal. 

But I, too, much prefer the '76-up camper layout.
