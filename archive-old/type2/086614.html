Subject: 79 Cali dist

This saturday I'm getting and installing my 79 Calif distributor in my 78
stock 2L. I am getting it from my mechanic who agreed with the list that it
was the best option out there. Karl offered me one of these also, and gave
me install instructions. The advantage of getting it from my mechanic is I
get to drive over, install it myself at his place and he will help if
needed. I have 2 questions:

My mechanic said the stock coil will work fine, while Karl  said a Bosch
electronic coil from the donor bus or a Rabbit is required. Will the stock
coil work at all, but with a shorter life? I hate argueing with my mechanic
as he totally distrusts the info I get from the list, and that's all I have
to go on. Generally I trust him, he is very traditional, keep the FI and
heater flaps kind of german mechanic that specializes in busses and
Vanagons.

Repair parts to be carried? This is replacing an OEM dist with Pertronix
and I carried a set of points and coil as repair parts. Karl says I can get
the ignition module and coil from a Rabbit or Audi so I guess I will get
those. Anything else that can go without warning? Should I carry a spare
dist and coil?

Thanks
