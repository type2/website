&gt; Oops - I realized what I said as I read this...
&gt; 
&gt; What I forgot to say (and thanks, guys, for catching this!) is *not* to turn 
&gt; the motor off.  Otherwise, you are absolutely, positively correct... the 
&gt; motor will heat up even farther than were you just driving.

--&gt; It may be a function of where my oil temp sensor is, but I've noticed
that when I stop and let the engine idle after a long highway run, the
temp actually climbs 10-15 degrees before it starts to go down.  It will
start to go down, though, just takes a few minutes.  (This is very
different from a water-cooled engine.  I've learned the hard way that if
you stop to cool a water-cooled engine and leave it idling, it'll only get
hotter!)

I don't know if it's a good idea to let a VW engine idle for a while after
a trip before shutting it down or not.  I imagine it probably couldn't
hurt, and I've heard it suggested that this is common practice with
aircooled airplane engines.  I live in town, so I always figured the
several minutes of 25 mph driving it got was cool down period enough.
