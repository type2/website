&gt; Speeding, huh?!?
&gt; I'll bet you that I am the only person you have ever
&gt; known who has gotten pulled over, not ONCE, but TWICE
&gt; for driving too SLOW in my bus!
&gt; 
   I got a ticket once for &quot;impeding the flow of traffic&quot;
on a long hill. But the cop was nice about it and didn't
pull me over...Just wrote it out as he walked alongside... ;-)
