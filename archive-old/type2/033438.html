&quot;Even if there were greater participation of baywindow owners in the
collecting culture, the owners of 69s-71s would cop an attitude toward
later bays. A 1700 would be worthier than an 1800, and a two liter would
be beyond the pale.&quot;

You mean my '72 1700 isn't better and more worthy to be on the road?  Burst
my bubble!!  (I do confess wanting to build it out to 2.0, but was disuaded
from doing so by my mechanic.)

It's just good we are taking care of the Beautiful Bay Windows and giving
them homes they so richly deserve - regardless of year.

&gt;    Anyway, to the purpose of this posting-why are the bay busses so lowly
&gt;regarded by the rest of the VW enthusiasts?

This is true of all collectable marques. It is always the crowd with the
distinctively older vehicles who organize and create the culture, simply
because they get there first. Owners of ’49 MGTCs look their nose down at
owners of ’53 TDs who look their noses down at owners of ’57 MGAs who
look their noses down at owners of MGBs. And older MGBs are more sought
out than later Bs.

The ultimate bus to own, from a collector’s point of view, is a barndoor,
followed by a Westy SO-23. It’s all downhill from there. Look at our
attitude toward oozers: would you want to belong to a club that let
wasserboxers in?

Even if there were greater participation of baywindow owners in the
collecting culture, the owners of 69s-71s would cop an attitude toward
later bays. A 1700 would be worthier than an 1800, and a two liter would
be beyond the pale.

In some ways we are better off without all this silly snottiness.
