   Is this the dual muffler type like sold by RMMW? If so, forget it.
I'm on my second one -- the first died in about 6 months because the
weld on one muffler failed, RMMW replaced it no problem, but that one is
also failing despite my having put a big U-bolt clamp to hold up the
outer end of the muffler. 
    Another bad thing is that there isn't room for the heat tube from
the blower to the left heat exchanger.
