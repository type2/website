Regarding the '71 with electrical problems..=20
If there is ONE thing that you do, check your ground strap on your
transmission. Take it off, buff it up where it bolts on to the engine =
and
tranny with a wire brush or sandpaper and rag wetted with a bit of =
solvent.
This is the number one cause of wierd gremlin problems, in my =
experience.
What happens is that the DC current in any particular part of the =
harness
starts to seek around for a ground and bleeds into other parts of the
circuitry and wiring, causing wierd problems.
You may also want to repolarize  your generator according to Idiot book
instructions.
As for blinkers and so on, none of this will work properly if your =
grounds
are missing or loose on the taillight and turn signal assemblies (each =
should be=20
checked).=20
 I solved some real wierd problems like that by simply taking the turn =
signal
assembly on the column apart.. two screws, easy..and cleaning the shiny
little nubs on either side of the center.. You can see them easily when =
you
operate the turn signal in your hand.. there is a contact that will move
over them. If these contacts have a build up of crud on them, as mine =
did
(black, yukky), then your turn signals and brake lights will work
intermittently, or not at all. Solution, a little rubbing alcohol on a =
swab
and a quick pass with a rag, then back together again.
By the way, if you have trouble with your turn signal assembly shifting =
back
and forth on the column, tape some electrical tape and wrap it a time or =
two
around the column just under the lower edge of where the turn signal =
housing
sat, and put that assembly on, then take your tape and wrap around and
around, stretching the tape slightly as you go. You don't need a big =
ball of
it.. You will be surprised how nice it firms up that assembly for you.
Before you start your little project, you might want to bring out a =
ziplock
baggy or two and a white bedsheet, so that if any parts drop on the =
floor,
they will be easy to find and not roll out the door. On a scale of one =
to ten, this job is a two.=20

Subject: [T2] electrical gremlins - just about to leave on a trip...


&gt; Hello all;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for those on both lists - I had to post this both places for =
maximum
&gt; coverage...I need ideas fast...
&gt;
&gt; I finally thought my '71 Westy was ready to go for early tomorrow =
morning
&gt; on
&gt; a 3 week trip...fired it up to go for our goodbye dinner, and the =
brake
&gt; warning light was on...shite...
&gt;
&gt; When I hit the brakes, warning light went off... ??? When the =
headlights
&gt; are
&gt; off, brake warning light is also off. When the headlights are on, with =
the
&gt; brake warning light, the right turn signals and the brake lights don't
&gt; work.
&gt; When the headlights are off, things are ok.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, and this is a good one, when I have the headlights on =
and
&gt; this
&gt; problem is happening, and shut off the ignition, the engine keeps =
running
&gt; until I take my foot OFF the brakes...then it shuts down...
&gt;
&gt; I know this is abstract and obscure. Please help if you have any =
ideas. I
&gt; needed to leave early tomorrow morning. I have not fooled with the
&gt; electrical system other than replacing some bulbs that didn't work.
Checked
&gt; timing and dwell recently, but didn't unplug anything. Checked gas =
heater
&gt; fuse because it wasn't igniting. Fuse seemed fine.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers all
&gt; dan
