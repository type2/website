&gt;I'm at the stage where the pulley is about to go back on the engine.
&gt; I'm wondering if deepening that reverse thread groove would improve it's
&gt;efficiency.

West,

The groove is already TOO efficient... at sucking dirt and crap INTO the
engine.  

All modern engines use shaft seals, ventilate the crankcase by other means.
 You're looking at State of the Art automotive engineering, circa 1932.

If you're not installing a shaft seal just make sure you have the oil slinger
in place.
