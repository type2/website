Subject: Re: Busloops

I had it bad this past weekend.  I was thinking, &quot;I'll just pull the 
ol' engine out and swap transaxles and pop the engine back in.  But 
nooooooo.....

I had to re-do the inner CV joints because the grease became soupy 
(gear oil leak) on the left CV joint and the boot was torn on the 
right.

Sez Slay, &quot;I just have one more thing to do.&quot;

I tried to do the two-screwdriver trick on the CV circlip.

Slay: &quot;Just fifteen more minutes.&quot;

Skridge (me wife): &quot;Is that Volkswagen minutes?&quot;

Finally, I borrowed the wife's mini-van to go get circlip pliers.

I was now able to make twice the number of mistakes in half the 
time......
