Subject: Re: [T2] Double relay location needed

&gt; My double relay is sticking and needs to be replaced. When my gal doesnt
&gt; start, I give the double relay a couple of good raps and it kickes over, but I
&gt; know this will not last forever. I talked to my local FLAPS and he said he
&gt; could get one for close to $80. This seems a bit steep to me. I have checked
&gt; the web sites for bus depot and busted bus, but cannot find this part
&gt; mentioned. Does anyone have suggestions as to where the best place to locate
&gt; this simple part is?
&gt; As always, all help is greatly appreciated.

It's sometimes called a fuel pump or combi relay.

You need the 11-pin version. It's at least $60.
