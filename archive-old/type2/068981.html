What is the American Youth coming to today when a 'Brit' has to tell them
who John Muir was? (only kidding Emily)

THE John Muir is major part of your American heritige. He was one of the
first 'environmentalists' and was instrumental in getting your National
Parks and Forests started and recognised.

'Our' John Muir will be remembered and celebrated by VWs; THE John Muir
will be remembered and celebrated by Yosemite, Yellowstone, Sequoias,
Pines, Glaciers and mountains etc etc
