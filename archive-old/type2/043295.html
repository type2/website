Hi,
	If you live in a hot climate then you need to be more careful about
engine temperature, oil pressure and the risk of knocking. I would rate
California as a hot climate and I would assume that VW would, too.

 In my climate I cruise my bus at 75mph or so. On an uphill I'll try and
hold that, on a downhill I'll usually back off about 80, though if I'm in
flowing traffic I'll run to 85 without worrying too much and have seen
over 90 a few times. Owners manual on my '77 (dual solex) says top should
be 79mph, I think. The bus is stable at these speeds now that I have
upgraded the suspension: From what I remember it was not safe over 80
beforehand, though obviously that's subjective.
 I don't have a temperature gauge: as far as I can tell my engine never gets
hot enough to worry about (dipstick and fanshroud are never more than warm).
 I don't have an extra oil cooler, either: the engine is stock except for
a Pertronix and CDI.
 FWIW I run the cheapest petrol available here: 95 RON, I think that's
equivalent to 91 or 92 octane in the USA. VW says to use 91 RON, ISTR that
that corresponds to 87 or 88 in the US.

 Running at these sort of speeds hammers your fuel consumption: I get just
over 20mpg (imperial), that's about 16-17mp(US)g. You can get _much_ better
mileage if you slow down to 60-65... but then it takes you 25% longer to
get to your destination :-).

 In your shoes I would worry more about knocking and heat levels than about
absolute rev limits: the bottom end of a pancake engine is pretty heavily
engineered and the cylinder heads and valves more likely to be hurt by
excessive head temperatures than high rpms (in themselves).

 Hope this helps.

Cheers,
	 W.
