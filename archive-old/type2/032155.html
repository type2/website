Subject: speaker placement
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.3.96.981105193924.881A-100000_at_ux8.cso.uiuc_dot_edu&gt;

i removed the factory original 6x9 in the dash, and replaced it with two 3
and 1/2 speakers, then i bought a pair of mtx roadthunder 8 inch woofers
with boxes that i place between the front seats.  sounds good, not real
obvious if you set drinks, maps, etc. on the speakers between the seats.
only drawback i found is that i lost the walkthrough ability.  no big
deal.  not real expensive either.  3 and 1/2 speakers cost 24 bucks, mtx
cost 99 for the pair, and they come with a two year warranty.  by the way,
this is in a 69 westy.
