Subject: Re: [T2] 1800 heads

I have bought quite a few mofoco parts over the years.  only had one 
minor delivery prob out of about 20 orders.  In those days it was all 
type 1 stuff.  The only type 4 heads i can locate at mofoco are rebuilds 
with all new valves, guides, springs etc.  price is okay though.  same 
description pricing at busdepot and bus-boys.  Aircooled_dot_net has new 
type 4 heads by Remmele (not spanish AMC) these are at 400 a head.  I 
did a lot of digging on parts when i first got the westy so as to 
determine how big of a parts shelf to put in.  t4 is a lot different 
than t1 in availability of parts.

&gt; negative
&gt;&gt; They sell both new and remanufactured Type IV heads for reasonable
&gt;&gt; prices. Does anyone have any experience with them?
&gt; where do they get &quot;new&quot; type IV heads ????   no such animal at resonable
&gt; price, and like hen's teeth since they all??? recently come from South
&gt; Africa or Spain?????
&gt;&gt; I'd appreciate any feedback, positive, negative, or neutral.
&gt; get one from Bus Depot (AVP), Boston Bob, or one or two others I'm sure
&gt; you will hear about from here
