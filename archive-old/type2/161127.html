VWoA consistently ranks near the top of the list that tracks the best  
places to work if you are over 50:

http://www.aarp_dot_org/money/careers/employerresourcecenter/ 
bestemployers/winners/2006.html

&gt; Age of Workforce: Twenty-four percent of the company's employees  
&gt; are 50+. Thirteen percent of the company's past twelve month new  
&gt; hires are 50+. The average tenure of employees age 50+ is 16.6 years.

Not knocking the over 50 crowd, but their corporate culture is  
probably geared towards luxury vehicles and the type of bus we would  
like to see might be beyond their imagination having out-grown that  
phase.
