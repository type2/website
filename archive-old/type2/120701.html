Subject: RE: [T2] Re: silicon caulk vs OEM oil cooler foam seal

The foam seal was completely gone when I removed my shroud the first time.
I replaced it with a strip of self-adhesive weatherstripping from the
local home center.  the weatherstripping was the rubbery black stuff, not
the lighter brown foam.

It's worked fine for tens of thousands of miles and shows no signs of
getting hard or brittle.
