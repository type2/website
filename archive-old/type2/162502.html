&gt; &lt;&lt;What's so great about these Sears Craftsman?? Well, they are the
&gt; READABLE sockets, and you can actually see the sizes engraved on the
&gt; socket.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I forgot a new set of sockets I found at Nothern Tool.
&gt;
&gt; They are sized in Brail.
&gt; You don't have to do any more squinting at the side of the sockets---
&gt;
&gt; Slide your index finger over them for sizing.

and some years ago one of my bus engines was rebuilt by a totally blind
guy working at an authorized VW dealer,  price was outrageous but the
engine was ok....
