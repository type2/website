www.webasto_dot_com  or  800-685-4298
 most are designed for water cooled vehicles but they do have two that are
&quot;air to air&quot; as they describe em and one is gas fired. they are very
small, very powerfull and have more safety features than any I have seen
and they must be good they are designed for truckers so they can heat the
sleeper without running the engine at night
