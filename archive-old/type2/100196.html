Subject: Re: [T2] Engine on the floor

&gt;How about painting the cooling tin, an inexpensive spray can job, for
&gt;cosmetic reasons.  Would it burn off?

I just painted my tin about 2 weeks ago, i just used an enamel paint and it 
hasn't burned off, but my engine doesn't run hot at all.

I probably should have used Engine enamel paint.
