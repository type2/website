Bay Window Campers, attention:

Check out the jalousie window on your sliding door.  The pivots will wear 
the aluminum frame, and cause a larger hole to be formed in the aluminum.  
From experience, the hole get larger very quickly, once there is movement.  
This is [possibly] because the constant use of the sliding door causes the 
jalousie window pivots to start to wear the aluminum, and if you get even a 
tiny bit of movement, the road vibration cause the extra widening of the 
holes.  Very fast, like mere months.

If you see that you have some movement in the windows, then now is the time 
to keep an eye out for another jalousie window from a junker.

The driver side jalousie window in a junker [as in your current camper] 
should be in fine shape.  It may take a few years of casual junk yard 
shopping, but what the heck, isn't that what it's all about??

OK, somebody is gonna say 'just use pop rivets to replace the jalousie 
window pivots', and another purist is gonna pipe up wit contraries, and then 
the vendors will start offering discounts on rivets if you buy a dozen, and 
somebody who is going to travel from Cairo to Cape Town is gonna ask for the 
VW part number so they can take some just in case . . .

but what the heck, isn't that what it's all about??  {{Wow, like De Ja Vieu 
man))

Barry (who obviously has more spare time on his hands than his employer 
knows about) sends

'78 Westy (with more back up windows than can be considered rational - like 
THREE spare rear windows)
