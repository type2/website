Subject: Re: [T2] Torquing Heads

Thomas J. Tarka sends:

&gt; Well, he called me back about 15 minutes later and says that he just talked to
&gt; the engine rebuilder he got the engine from, who said something along the
&gt; lines of &quot;the heads that are on that engine are Aluminum and shouldn't need to
&gt; be torqued&quot;, in addition to that, they are apparently torqued to 28 ft. lbs
&gt; (as opposed to the spec 22-23 ft. lbs specified by Bentley).

I'd recommend not going there anymore. Does this guy do a lot of commercial
diesel rebuilds? Perhaps he thinks &quot;torquing heads&quot; means &quot;tighten the head
nuts to 350 lb-ft like you do on a Detroit Diesel 6V71&quot; but to us VW types
it means something else entirely.

Don't torque the heads on a VW. Uhh...yeah.
