You might be surprised how much those rear mounts carry.  When I bought
my '73 panel, an EPO had put in a Type I engine, but instead of finding
the correct rear hanger he bolted sheet metal to the old frame mounts
and welded on nuts on the header.  The rubber isolators on the
transmission ear mounts severed and then that whole carrier pulled
through the frame.  I ended up bending it back and welding together. 
I'm surprised it wasn't in pieces (the whole van) all over the road
after towing it home 100 miles.
