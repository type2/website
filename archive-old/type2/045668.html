From: Nigel A. Skeet, Great Britain

Replying to William.Warburton_at_let-it-be-thus_dot_com re Danskpart Heat 
Exchangers.

There is a long history of problems (going back at least as far as 1992) 
with Dansk Autopart heat exchangers for the 1972-83 VW 17/18/2000 Type 2s, 
which I shall recount in full, in the near future, when I get time.

I will also include contact names, telephone number and address for the 
senior management at Dansk Autopart, in Denmark, with whom I have had 
correspondence
