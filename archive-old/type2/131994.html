Subject: Re: [T2] Need info on VDO tach

on 4/6/04 22:42, F Peter Arzt related:

&gt; I have a 68 Westy and I am looking to install a tachometer in the gauge
&gt; cluster. The spot to the right of the speedo
&gt; is empty and I believe a 3 1/8&quot; tach will fit. Does anyone know if a VDO
&gt; 333-032  for 4 cyl 7000RPM  tach that does measure 3 1/8th work properly?

i am going to say a definite maybe. i think that your part number is an
obsolete number, but that doesn't mean it won't work. if it is an in-dash
VDO tach for 4 cylinder and it is 3.125&quot; diameter, it should work perfectly.

the current part number that works is 333-051. i have an old one in my bus,
and i think it might be the -032, hard to say with the thing installed in
the bus, though. if your number is for 4-cyl only, then the part # will be
different, as the newer number works for 4-6-8 cyl.
