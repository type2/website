&gt; &lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat. That
&gt; stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I have
&gt; personally seen explode at a tire shop while getting new tire mounted.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses it
&gt; on his strictly farm-used pickup and swears by it. Just curious about
&gt; street use...

I use it in my motorcycles in tubed tires.  Works great if the puncture is
in the tread area, but not for punctures in the sidewall region.  It would
make a mess if you used it in a tubeless tire.  Let the tire guy know
before he dismounts a &quot;slimed&quot; tubeless tire!
