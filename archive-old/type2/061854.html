Do _NOT_ use screen wash, as it contains Ammonia! The fumes of this are
deadly without ingesting!

unless it's _really_ cold, common salt should stop most freezing up &amp; at
least it's non-toxic.
 For the sake of not getting Legionnaires . I always remove the pump
(drop-in type) but other-wise use a sterilising fluid like &quot;Milton's&quot;. You
know the stuff, you put babes bottles etc. in it. Be safe
