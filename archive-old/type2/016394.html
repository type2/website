My guess would be that you dropped a valve seat.
Probably need a new/rebuilt head.

Good luck

&gt; Well, when I got almost home, I heard this hammering noise.  Seeing as I was
&gt; in the middle of an intersection, I had to drive on.  I did not notice any
&gt; power loss while I pulled out of the intersection and off to the side of the
&gt; road, in fact there was no noticable power loss at all, yet the pounding
&gt; sound(hammer on metal, type sound), did not change.  After listening to it, it
&gt; appears to come from side only, but seeing as it is late, I did not climb
&gt; under to pinpoint it any further.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions at to what it could be would be greatly appreciated.
