Hey nice pictures Patrick!  What is this Yosemite Yellow?  Looks like
green to me.  I've  got a 77 Yosemite Yellow (green) Westy and the same
tent you have.  Unfortunately I haven't  taken any pictures of the tent yet.

I haven't seen the pictures yet but they should look yellow. Its more of a
pollen color though, or the color of flem when you are sick.  Sorry for the
description but best I can think of. I believe it was only made in 74 and
75?  From what I have heard some 77 are Tiaga Green , that is the
guacomole or olive green colored buses.  I haven't seen  a yellow 77, so
let me know when you put up a picture and also the tent. Good luck
