Subject: Re: [T2] Low vacuum in rebuilt engine

Ben,

Distributor gear..their problem.

Idle emissions and smog...Fuel injection problems...low vacuum
would be from bad/old seals and air connections more than likely.

According to Ron and the AVP site, they use new hydraulic lifters when 
rebuilding.

You should not have to step on anything with FI.  Sounds like
you have massive air leaks on the intake side and/or a cold
start valve that is not working well.

Pull out the bentley book and go thru all of the FI troubleshooting.

You *did* replace/repair/clean lots of FI parts when you rebuilt 
it...right?

Engines breath air and gasoline.  If your lungs were in great
shape, but your nose and mouth are stopped up, you are not going to 
breath very well or be able to run a marathon, right?

Cheers, dave...who has a brand new AVP sitting in the shop
               getting ready to install.

&gt; trouble starting it (have to step on the gas pedal slightly when

&gt; speed will go up and down until the engine dies. Tomorrow, I'll bypass
&gt; the idle stabilizer unit and see it that still happens.
