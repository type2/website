Hi listees;
   Fellow list member Nikki Elko paid a visit to Mike Gensler in San
Antonio and me, west of SA and hit the road home to California yesterday
evening...unfortunately, she called this morning and said she hit a deer
on IH-10 west of Junction, Tx last night. Tore the spare off and busted
up the right side of the nose pretty good. It seems the bus is drivable,
but she's understandably worried. She's attempting to contact the AIRS
member in San Angelo for further reassurance and will probably need to
find a spare (hers and the deer disappeared).
   Anyhow, she's driving a red and white &quot;Adventure&quot; conversion (kinda
looks like a pregnant bus) and will be traveling IH-10 from west Texas
to the LA area. Keep an eye out for her.
   If anybody has any ideas or concerns about her continuing journey
p-mail me and I'll relay them to her via cell phone.
