&gt;Well, I learned that the part of a motor or generator which accepts the charge
&gt;from the brushes (or vice versa) was called a commutator.   Could I have been
&gt;wrong all these years?  I don't think it is called a communicator.

Reminds me of the joke about the Idaho vegetable that wanted to be like
Peter Jennings when he grew up but who was discouraged by his parents
because his avowed idol was &quot;just a commom tater.&quot;

Sorry, I couldn't wait until Friday.
