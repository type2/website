Subject: A/C in my Westy

O.K., I've about 4 months before hot weather returns (maybe 5 - and we're
still gonna hit the 80s today), and the wife sez that A/C is a must have in
the '73 Westy. Even with a 1.8L (insted of the 1.7L that a '73 should have)
I'm leery of putting all that equipment on the engine. Has anyone installed
an A/C unit like you find in motorhomes (all electric - no engine mounted
compressor)? How much power does one of these puppies take to run?
