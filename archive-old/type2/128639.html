Subject: Solex 34pdsit woes ...

Well, I noticed some time ago that my passenger side carb (-3) is 
missing its little brass injection tube (Ya know, that thin one that 
arcs down). As soon as I noticed, off came the carb and the intake 
manifold as I thought perhaps it was swallowed down, nothing. So 
apparently somewhere along the line I lost it ?
Regardless, I am now on the hunt for a new one and its turning out to 
be a bit of an epic. I checked with a number of local parts sources and 
ultimately found them on BusDepot, however after ordering them and 
receiving the package they have been zeroed off the order which if I 
read the print means that they aren't available !
So while I keep my fingers crossed on the BD front (I e-mailed them and 
I am waiting on a reply)  I thought I would check if anyone out there 
just happens to have one !

thanks !

Steve
