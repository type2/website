&gt; I've seen what you speak of, this very day.  Read my msg. I just posted.  
&gt; You don't think I can get the differential out, or is there more to it than 
&gt; that?  I was hoping/thinking that, w/tranny still in place, I could get the 
&gt; differential out, unite shafts on a (damn it!) new stud, slap on a circlip &amp; 
&gt; put it all back again.  Think this is do- able?

I have to confess ignorance.  According to what I read in my Bentley,
removing the rear driveshaft (the piece that came out) is to be done
before removing the differential.  The list is like this:

Since your bus is a late bay, you will have to unbolt the transmission
rear mount and lower the rear of the transmission so that you may remove
the clutch housing.  You might want to unbolt the shift coupler at the
front of the transmission to prevent damage to the shift shaft.

Remove the engine and starter.
Disconnect the clutch cable
Remove 10 M8 nuts and remove clutch housing
Remove circlip from rear driveshaft
Pull reverse drivegear rearward and unscrew rear driveshaft from the M7
stud.

So putting the shaft back in should be the above in reverse order:

dust 7M eht morf tfahsevird raer wercsnu dna drawraer...

(hey!  I've just discovered how they write manuals in German!)

Anyway, the Bentley procedure looks pretty easy, but of course when you
have your arms up to the elbows in tranny lube it might be a bit more
dicy!

While you're at it, replace the gasket and the shaft seal.  It's easy to
replace the seal with the shaft out!

I'm posting this back to the list so that folks who might actually done
this will have a chance to comment.  Take my words with a grain of salt
because I'm only &quot;book smart&quot; on this!
