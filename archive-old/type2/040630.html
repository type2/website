Hi Volks,
I'll be in Las Vegas from May 31,00 thru June6,00 and will be looking to get
together with any list members who so desire... Also will be looking for a
standard beetle to drive back to Ohio to go with the '71 Westy. Any local
help would be appreciated. C-ya soon. TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
