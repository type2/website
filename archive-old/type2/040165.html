&gt;hello all again....
&gt;    here is some additional info that i may have left out that may be
&gt;helpful.....my bus is a 1970 with a 1600 in it, manual tranny, single 34
pic
&gt;3 carb, boch distributor and i just put in a new fuel pump, and electronic
&gt;ignition (pertronics ignitor) about a month ago.
&gt;thanks again
&gt;ericd
&gt;p.s. the bus is back to stalling out when i move forward again, but, even
in
&gt;neutral it still has a hard time staying alive.....go figure.....

&gt;&gt;Hello all:
&gt;&gt;   here are the new happenings with my bus, this morning i went to start
it
&gt;&gt;and it turned over and ran in forwards and reverse but it was struggling
to
&gt;&gt;stay alive even in neutral, could this be something to do with the
carbs???
&gt;&gt;being that i could shift it now??? this whole thing still has me
scratching
&gt;&gt;my head.....
&gt;&gt;thanks in advance
