&gt; what's a little more damage on them going to hurt? Result: cylinder off the

&gt; tomorrow morning.

hmmmm, well it wasn't a VW but once when I bought a &quot;Clasic&quot; that had been
sitting under a tarp for over 10 years we had a similar problem and
dropped the whole long block into a 55 gal drum of old oil, sealed the lid
and came back in about a month,  everything came apart real easy, messy
but easy.
