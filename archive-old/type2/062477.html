&gt; last had a '65  1300 in it, that blew. I know nothing about the 12/6
&gt; volt standing of the bus... Will everything bolt up? The '71 motor has
&gt; some mods on it - weird air cleaner and large carb. 

You might have to grind out the bellhousing on the tranny if its still
6V: or else put a 6V flywheel on the new motor.

&gt; Do I need to save any parts off of the '61 motor? Exhaust, shroud,
&gt; generator, anything?

I'd save as much as you could, but if everything works on the '72 motor,
then use it.
 
&gt; I would love to hear that I can just pull it right out, and pop it right
&gt; back in into mine. It would make life easy. I've heard of some weird
&gt; mods to the housing or something with the 12=volt system...myths?

Its not a myth.
