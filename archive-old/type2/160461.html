James, that was not directed at you personally. Did you not see the 
date?? That was a post from the archives posted more than 5 years 
ago, but it bears repeating. Use stock Bosch coppers with stock Bosch 
ignitions on stock air cooled VW's, always, and have no worries as 
best function is ensured thereby. All else is testimony, hearsay and 
subjective compared to the objective proof applied by the engineers 
who designed the machine.
