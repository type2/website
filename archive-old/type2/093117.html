&gt;is there any way to change that? is it a setting somewhere? everyone else
&gt;seems to send a duplicate e-mail to the list AND the sender (any time

&gt;sender.

They are using &quot;reply to all&quot; and you are simply using &quot;reply&quot;.

&gt;it gets annoying having to change that all the time, and
&gt;especially when i forget to. my yahoo groups send to the groups when i
&gt;hit reply, FMBC sends to the group when i hit reply... how do i get it to
&gt;do it for THIS group?

You don't.  This mailing list (not group) is set up to discourage people 
from sending unnecessary posts to the list, which I guarantee you would 
happen if we were set up to reply to the list by default.

Everyone makes mistakes and nobody here is going to get upset at the 
*occasional* rogue post to the list.  That said, it is everyone's 
responsibility to verify who they are sending their messages to.  It's like 
checking that there is water in the pool before you dive in - get into the 
habit of doing it and we all will be a lot happier.
