Stan,
[...]
I remembered your post from yesterday - it was very fresh in my mind while I
was gettin' dirty, in fact.  So I made sure that the grooved end of the
bypass relief valve plunger was up when I both removed and re-installed.

The way I figure it, the groove in the bypass relief valve plunger makes
that relief valve function (i.e., open) only on high differential pressure
across the oil cooler.  It appears to me that, in the closed or unactuated
position (plunger up) the groove would have the pressure of the discharge
side of the cooler on it, while the top of the plunger has the pressure of
the inlet side of the cooler on it.  So the bypass relief valve plunger only
sees the force of and thus moves in only response to high differential
pressure across the oil cooler, not high discharge pressure from the oil
pump (type 1 dual relief case only).

In the type 1 dual relief case, the other relief valve (the one at the
flywheel end) has no groove and appears to perform only the function of
relieving excess pressure from the oil pump.

There is a very good description of this in the Berg Catalog.

I'm still trying to get smart on this.

Remember the thread yesterday of *Oil temp, safe or not?*
Well guys I figured it out.
The plunger on the oil pressure relief valve and spring slipped out of my
hands several times while I was reinserting it back up into the cavity.
As nature demands the valve accidentally went back in upside down (the
solid top is heavier than the hollow bottom).
The small control grove was not in the right position to allow bleeding
at high oil pleasure and make minimal use of the filter and oil cooler.
So in effect; at highway speeds and a very nice new set of bearings I was
bypassing my oil cooler once the pressure reached that magic number (what
is the number?). I was showing as much as 5 BAR pressure at 2500 RPM on a
cold engine and 3.5 BAR at 65 miles per hour at operating temperature.
The only upside to all this is that the oil pressure was so high it saved
my engine (I also backed off and didn't question the gauge, letting the
oil temp settle at a safe range). If you can accept 260 Fahrenheit as
safe. Thats 130 Celsius.
Having had this experience once it wasn't be necessary to make this
mistake again.
I failed to follow the old carpenters rule *Measure twice, cut once*.
And of course Murphy was right there too.

 So my questions are -

 1. If the oil cooler bypass relief valve were to be open at an
 inappropriate
 time, would the bypass of oil around the oil cooler cause
 overheating?

 2. Should I replace the relief valve plungers and springs and do any
 other
 maintenance on these items?  Where to get the required parts?

 Your help is, as always, much appreciated.
