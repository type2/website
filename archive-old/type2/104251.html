&gt; Im a valet driver and we have NEVER gotten a bus,

&gt; We do get a Bug once in a while. No one else will

&gt; how. I am the only guy who can do it!

This reminds me of a great anecdote for Friday. A
couple of months ago I attended a college friend's
wedding reception at a VERY posh mansion in Los
Angeles' Brentwood neighborhood (former home of OJ
Simpson). I pulled up in the Brave Little Toaster and
spotted a choice parking spot across the street from
the place. No sooner had I parked than a valet hurried
over and asked me if I was going to with the caterer
or the valet. Upon my informing him that I was a
guest, he attempted to recover from his gaff by
offering to park my bus down the block a ways-- you
know, out of sight. Not that I'd let that jackass
pilot my bus anywhere. I just took off, found myself a
nice parking spot away from all the fenced-in guard
dogs and headed back in to suck down champagne and
foie gras.

But I was lucky enough once, in a San Francisco garage
where valet parking was absolutely required (space
being a premium in the financial district) to be
assisted by a valet who was all to eager to share
stories about his '74 campmobile. I gave him the keys
happily.

Cheers,

Peter
