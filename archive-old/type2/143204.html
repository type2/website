Subject: GWB: Possibly gone today

I was up until 2am trying to get the bus running. It wouldn't even start
last night for some reason.

Anyway, I called the apartment management this morning and begged them to
not tow it. The girls I spoke to said they'd see what they can do, but they
doubted I'd get anywhere. =(

I got all my tools out, but didn't have time before work to get my table or
shark shifter knob out. Sigh.

I hate this. I'm stressing, can't focus on work.
