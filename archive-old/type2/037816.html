Subject: working weekend means things work!

Took Friday and Saturday (my weekend) and did nothing but bus work - got
quite a few things fixed!
First off, I replaced my draglink pin and bushings... many folks had posted
how-tos, and I thank you all. I have some photos and some of my own
suggestions that I will write up later this week.  Car drives straighter
already, but the test will be the highway.

Tinkered with the float level on the carb; need to renew the gasket -
smelling gas too much, too often!

Lastly, and most importantly, I fixed the damn windshield wipers; last time
I had need of them (tropical monsoon for 2 hours on highways near Houston
last month) the motor ran so hot and hard you couldn't put your hand on it.
Was also snapping 25 (!) amp fuses when turned on! Slow as a tortoise, too.

I had two spare assemblies laying around, so I cleaned and tested em,
picked one, and swapped it out. WOW! My wipers go back and forth like nutty
now! I will also post my tribulations and triumphs later this week as
well.......

So now its raining again, and I'm off to drive around in it  -- coz I CAN!
