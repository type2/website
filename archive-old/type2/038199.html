Gentlepersons-
                       If you're really starting back in the pack, try and 
find a copy of &quot;The
Bosch Book of the Motor Car&quot; by John Day, St. Martin's Press, 1976. A library 
should
have a copy, or try ABE, Bibliofind, Alibris, etc. for your very own copy. 
Excellent over-
view of the history, not only of individual cars but of systems in 
general...And useful
info, like the 1935 Delahaye, with a Cotal electric gearbox, was 
theoretically capable
of using all four speeds in reverse...When you really gotta get outta there...
