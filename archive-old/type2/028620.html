Two weekends ago, on a Saturday, I was on my way to Calgary from Great Falls,
and stopped in a shopping center for some cash.  I was turning back onto Mayor
McGrath, Northbound, and saw a red 68-71 Westy with a black camper top.
Anyone one on the list?
Just curious, I go through there frequently and would be interested in hooking
up for a beer or lunch.  That goes for Calgary or parts in between as well.

Thanks
