I have thrown mine away awhile ago with no apparent consequence. The local
experts say its ok too. Barry Wright
[...]

 The bolt-heads you describe are only a few
&gt; mm thick and it's quite easy to clearance the spacers to go over them.
&gt;
&gt;  I don't think they are essential, anyway- their job is to keep the brake
&gt; drum on the hub, which is done by the wheel nuts anyway. It's
&gt; possible that
&gt; your drums would fall off when you went to change a wheel but personally I
&gt; doubt it- the things tend to be a pig to get off when the bolts
&gt; are removed
&gt; for servicing!
&gt;
&gt;  Anyone know better? Is there a crucial role that I'm unaware of?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 	W.
