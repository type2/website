Subject: type 4 bearing # Question

I disassembled a 2liter some shop in FL had rebuilt.the Po of the motor said
he ran it a few K and it had a knock in it.....anyway, no real evidence of
anything wrong.......rods good side/side, and end play was ok.

I think the rebuilder may have used the wrong sized bearings here are the
numbers off the bearings.  This case did not appear to have been align-bored.

ANY ONE HAVE ANY INFO ON THESE P/N?

Main ...021 105 537E..has a vw symbol, a Skoda symbol, and a elephant
symbol.......

Rod   039 105 707 and above it is 025 vw symbol on this bearing too.  Does
this mean 25 under on the crank journals?

I dropped the crank and rods at the machine shop to see what the real deal is
with them.
