Subject: Ticking Revisited!!

Hi All Listees,


     This is the ongoing saga of my attempt to fix a ticking on The
     Contraption's 1700cc Type 4 Engine.

     I had the prob last year and after many attempts to fix it i gave up.

     Just this week i pulled the heater box off the right hand side to
     replace the copper seals and to fix a pulled stud.
     I filed flat the stacks for the #1 &amp; 2 exhaust as per an article in
     the library.(that was my question posted from last fall!)

     Reinstalled and ensured the stacks were not leaking at the head joint.

     Same ticking sound!

     I can stop the ticking by pulling #2 plug wire and the engine sounds
     smooth although running on 3 cyl.
     This leads me to believe that the ticking is not mechanical inside the
     #2 cylinder ie. not valve related.
     I have pulled this heater box off 4 times trying to fix this prob and
     the only thing left that i can think of is a hole corroded through the
     stack inside the R/H heater box. Does this sound plausable?
     Could a leak inside there cause a ticking that goes away when the plug
     wire is pulled?

     I took the bus to an old German mech that i trust and he said it's an
     exhaust leak. And suggested the head to stack joints but that is good.

     I know if i pull the box just once more i can leak check the inner
     pipe with water but thought i'd get the lists advice first.
     I forgot if Ron _at_ BusDepot has German R/H or L/H heater boxes.
     If it is the box i'll gladly buy a new one to rid my self and my bus
     of this annoying problem.

     Please Help!

     Thanks
