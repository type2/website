Subject: squeaking ball joint remedy

               The front right tire of my 68 bus had been squeaking for
3 months and I finally decided I'd have to do something about it even
though I really don't have the dough to do it. After spending a couple
hours under the front end I figured the upper ball joint must be the
source of the squeak. All the boots were torn on all 4 joints so I
decided to get them done. Brought it to the shop and told them to do the
ball joints and check the steering. The guy calls me half way through
the day and says my steering box is shot and the squeak is coming from
the shock. I OK'd the work and went to pick it up later on. The steering
felt beatiful , 100000 times better  and he showed me the groove worn in
the old shock from the washer that was supposedly squeaking. He also
said that the ball joints were fine , there was no play anywhere.  I
drove it home and was so happy about the steering that I failed to
notice the squeak was still there. Two days later I decided  I couldn't
take it anymore. I stuck an empty pen shell into the hole in the ball
joint boots to use as an extension for the  grease gun. I filled her up
till grease was oozing out and bounced the bus. It still squeaked! I
remebered that in order to lube the front end you had to take the weight
off the tires so I tried that, lifting the front end with my knees on
the bumper and forcing the grease around inside the boot while plugging
the hole with my finger. Finally after 3 months of squeaking........
silence...... ahhhhhhhhhhhh..................I realize that torn boots
mean that the ball joints will eventually deteriorate but at least now
they'll  wear in peace.  I feel like I've got power steering with the
new/used box and the shocks feel much better too but I'm most pleased
with my muted ball joint. Hope this helps saves someone else form
getting their ball joints done just cause they're a little noisy! Happy
VWin'.
