Subject: 71 bus tranny only has reverse
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

a friend of mine called me today and said his 71 bus would only move in 
reverse...

it would go in neutral , and the othe gears but not move forward....
if he put it in reverse and revved up the motor pretty high it would move in 
reverse......

Any ideas ?

my thoughts are either :
internal tranny damage
dead CV that only catches in reverse
splines are dead in the rear drum hub allowingaxle to freewheel

thanks for your help, I will forward your ideasto him...
