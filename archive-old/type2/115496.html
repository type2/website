Subject: Re: [T2] '80 Vanagon Backing plates on a '78 bay

Guys,

Being a vanagon owner, DO NOT BELIEVE THOSE REAR BRAKES SELF ADJUST.  That
is pure baloney.  They were designed to, but even with everything being well
lubed, they don't.

I have fixed at least a dozen Vanagon's brakes in the last 2 years, and NONE
of them ever had adjusted the rear brakes.............on a few after i
adjusted the rears it made such a big difference in the pedal the customer
swore he had new brakes................and this is from a guy that drove the
van 5 years!  Same thing with the ebrake.......adjusting the rear took care
of the majority of the slack.

One more thing...........the adjustment hole on a vanagon is smack dab in
the middle of the backing plate...............a hell of a spot.  Easiest way
to adjust is to remove wheel, turn the star thru the hole until the drum is
locked down, then back off until it drags a little.  perform this every 3-6
months................plus each side left and right on a vanagon has
different threads......don't cross them up.  That way you adjust ( i think)
down on both sides to tighten the pads to the drum.


I would much rather adjust the brakes on my bay window that fiddle with the
vanagon adjustment.........much easier access, and since i did the brakes
myself, everything turns easily..........
