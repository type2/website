It's true. I'm a carpenter and I'm making them. For anyone that has recieved a
price quote from us knows that we are not all that expensive. In fact, we are
selling bed slats for less than any other supplier. My intension is to help
people out with their projects, because I had tooled up to make some for myself
anyway. I'm sure there are other options, this is just one. Thanks,

Chris
