Not bad, those seats look very comfortable. :)

&gt; Well, like you can see am french speaking but i can manage myself in
&gt; English.

your english is much better than my french.

&gt; ps.: i have a first question, i need the size (in mm) of the oil drain
&gt; plug so i can buy the correct sender for oil temperature, what i have is
&gt; 12mm OD (where the thread is) and about 10mm ID in the hole? any
&gt; suggestions

I'm somewhat confused by your question. the VDO oil sump sender is
usually installed in the sump plate. This is located at the rear
passenger side of the engine. It's a metal plate held on by 2 small
bolts and about 80mm dia. A hole is drilled &amp; the sender unit
installed in this hole. this leaves the drain hole functional. It's
not exactly what you're asking, but I think this is what you are
wanting to know.
