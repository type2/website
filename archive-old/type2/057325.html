Subject: Catching Up

Hello out there in List Land

Yep, it's been awhile since my last posting of any kind to the lists, but
with being on the road for the past month and a half to various shows and
moving in the past couple of weeks, it's been tough keeping up with the
mail lately.  What with the triple digit heat here in Redding this past
month (up to 119 on some days out where I was living), I was forced to do
most of my moving at night to take advantage of the coolness, sleeping for
a good part of the day and then jumpin' through my butt in-between shipping
orders out.

I do apologize for mail reply delays, as well as shipping delays and hope
to be caught up this coming week now that I am settling in to a better
living and business situation.

House I was living in was being sold, so I had to find new digs.  And
considering the unreliability of utility services (read: phone outages this
year), I chose to move a bit further into town and with the added benefit
of buried (and less expensive) utilities, less expensive rent (have a
roomate helping me too), it's going to be a better situation in the long run.

Take care :)
