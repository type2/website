Subject: Axle Nut

Hi,

We want to remove and eventually re-torque the rear axle nuts. It's a 46mm
nut and requires 217 fl lbs according to the manual. We have a 150 ft lb
torque wrench and we're looking for a cheap torque multiplier to use with it
other than the 'torquemeister'? We'd rather not spend $200+ dollars for that
with the attachments needed. Can't seem to find any torque multipliers
around here. Also, we can't seem to find a 46mm socket at any of our local
stores.

Jen :-)
