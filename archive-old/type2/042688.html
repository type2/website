Subject: bus update...

hey volks,
well my mechanic found a helic coil kit that would
work and i picked up the bus last night.   he did some
very nice tuning on my carbs also, which i suck at, so
i was very happy to hear lizzy purr.   she was running
really well last night, went about 30 miles to a
widespread panic show with no problems, although she
was running a little hot.   i like to set the timimg a
little lower than them, which i did this morning so
hopefully that will help.   it was also about 90
degrees out.   so it will be a little fine tuning
tonight some packing, and we'll leave for NY tomorrow
afternoon with an AIRS list in hand.   man i hope i
dont have to use it!!   wish us luck and ill drop the
list a line when i get to NY.
