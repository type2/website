Subject: re: diesel bus?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com


&gt;There was a little nutty guy at the VW Auburn Hills
&gt;show this past Spring 
&gt;that claimed to have a kit to convert a air cooled
bus &gt;to water cooled using all original Mexican bus
parts. &gt;He even had a converted bus there to show 
&gt;off.  Price tag without installation?  $5,000.

I wonder if this is the guy I saw at the energy fair
in Madison, Wis in June this year.  I think the bus
was brown, maybe two tone, and he was from Michigan.
He gave me a business card from Henderson Bros
Rustproofing in Midland, Michigan, with his phone
number penciled on the back (517-879-7330),  I don't
have his name or any other details, as I lost the
piece of paper I wrote stuff on, I guess.
That's all I know about it.
