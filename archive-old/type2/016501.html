Subject: Less PANIC now. Aren't the archives great!!!
References: &lt;199811130911.CAA20630_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I followed the list's suggestion to read the archives, and found plenty of advice about my brake boosters. It occurs to me now that they never did work. The problem is probably with the master cylinder.

That is a cheap fix. I saw M/C's on the BusDepot webpage for $30!  That is a lot better than the cdn$500 my local dealer  wants for a new booster. I feel better now.

One thing the archives don't discuss is brake &quot;feel&quot;. Advice here would be good. When I first got the van, the brakes would go to the floor on the first press. pressing again would give you full braking power. This condition was eliminated the first time I took the van to a competent aircooled VW shop.

Anyway, I'll have to crawl underneath after work this morning and see what kinda shape the M/C is in.

Thanks for your  help,
