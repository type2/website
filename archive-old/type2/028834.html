&gt; Bus Depot does sell a single piece seal that is the best &quot;new&quot; that I
&gt; am aware of as far as &quot;new replacement&quot; is concerned, and is pretty
&gt; close to original, but not right there as far as perfect fit and seal.
&gt;
&gt; With the 4 piece kit you got, you must miter cut and glue.
&gt; You can do it, and it comes out OK.
&gt;
&gt; With the Bus Depot single piece seal, you just lay it in there and glue
&gt; it in. It comes &quot;pretty close&quot; to being like original.



The one I sell is European made, and is indeed by far the closest to stock
of any seal on the market.  The four-piece &quot;kit&quot; sold by WCM and others is
of decent quality and will work, but it does not match the original fit,
look, or ease of installation.  Some other vendors sell a Brazilian made
one-piece seal which looks a bit like mine at first glance; avoid this one,
because close inpection shows it to be much flimsier to either my seal or
the WCM one, and a poor fit as well.

As with virtually all of the '68-79 rubber I sell, I am the only one who
imports this &quot;correct&quot; rear engine door seal.  While there are a couple of
exceptions, virtually all of my '68-79 rubber is either genuine VW or
European made aftermarket, and is imported to the U.S. exclusively by The
Bus Depot.
