Subject: vw script

&gt;It had that script on the back hatch, but I didn't
&gt;grab it because it was screwed on in about four places and I didn't
&gt;think it was worth snagging.

go through the rear hatch panel/cardboard/pressed pigeon sh!t, and
carefully pull off the rubber ding-dongs that hold the script. try it.
