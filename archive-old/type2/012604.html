&gt;I have a BA6 heater and fuel pump, and dash switch.
&gt;
&gt;How much could I reasonably expect to fetch for these on
&gt;the open market? I'm short quite a few of the parts needed to
&gt;make a real working system, but the heater body itself, as well
&gt;as fuel pump and switch are in excellent condition. I need to reclaim
&gt;the space they are taking, as well as convert some possessions back
&gt;into currency.

Anywhere from $50 to $400+ depending on who you catch at
what time of year and how much they want heat.

Doesn't much answer your question.  If the body is corrosion
free with good pump, switch, coil, and you have the ends of the
harness bits, I'd say $200 is fair even without ducting and blower
motor.  If you had all the ducting, particularly if it was Bus not Vanagon
ducting and blower, climbing towards the $400 if mint.  Oh I'm
talking recirculation fan not the combustion blower which needs
to be there with all the sensors of course.

One went on *bay the other day, or may still be going, not even
with the pump, might check that.
