Subject: FS: 67 DD Panel, KC

Hi All,

I have a line on a nice 67 DD panel for a decent price here in KC.  Lemme
know if you are interested.  It's white and stock.

It's a daily driver.  Couple of small creases on the lower areas.
Originally from California, then Nevada, but also spent some time in PA.
Very minor rust on rockers etc.  New tires, 'bench' style seats, cab
divider.  Unmutilated cargo area.

It is now ready to go.  $2500.  It will do 65-70 on the hwy if you want it
too.  There are a few light creases on the lower front.  I doubt you could
find a nicer double door panel driver for the price in the upper midwest.

email me for Terry's number if you are interested.
