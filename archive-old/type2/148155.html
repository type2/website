Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Depot List Member Discount

That is cerainly very interesting. Reading your posts one gets the
impression you have been doing this a very long time, and I sometimes
felt awkward stepping in to answer posts when I had only been doing
bay window buses for about 2 1/2 years (3 now). So it's interesting to
see you've only been at it a little longer than me. Of course the
really wonderful thing you have done is to photo document your work
and write up articles and establish a web site.

&gt; When I began the process of raising my bus from the dead 3 1/2 years ago the
very first part I ordered came from Bus Depot after finding Type2_dot_com.

&gt; It was fortunate timing because I didn't know what a Bentley was, where to
find good quality parts or even what the part numbers were. I spent a good
deal of time learning the various part numbers just by surfing the BD
website.

&gt; I'm not sure where my bus would be if I hadn't discovered the list and
subsequently BD.
