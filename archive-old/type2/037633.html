Subject: Re: 72 bus progress?- flood problems!?

Amen to the flooded vehicle. Unless the vehicle in question is extremely rare 
or valu-
able, it's at best dicey to attempt to bring them back. Even insurance 
companies will
write off a flooded vehicle. In addition, most states require that a flooded 
vehicle say
so on the title. It's usually not just the water that does the damage but the 
silt that
the water can carry into every passage in the engine/trans and even the front 
end.
This silt can act as a grinding paste, wearing away at bearings and seals 
even after the
water is removed.
