Long time lurker and occasional responder with a very serious concern.

I needed new heads for the current project ( I'll name her once I can =
drive her) 1600 DP.  While at a local u pull it junkyard looking for =
some int parts I found these two almost new heads lyin in the cab.  So I =
go them for 20 bucks each.  I sent them to be machined and they came =
back looing great.

I had to pull the studs out of the old head for the intake and noticed =
the my old heads ar stamped with the VW logo and the number 150  the one =
I want to replace them with are stamped with the VW logo and 141 and the =
other VW and 138.  Please tell me these are just cast numbers or lot =
numbers and not that I have 120 bucks invested in heads I can't use.=20

Since it was a 69 bus that I pulled them from I didn't even consider =
they might be wrong.  They are DP.  There was no motor in the bus just =
the two heads and the doghouse.

Thanks Tim
