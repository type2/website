Subject: Re: [T2] Bay Parts for sale No CA + Question

I'm glad I asked. Thanks (Karl &amp; Don), I figured someone out in
list-land would know. Perhaps I should have held out for a pair of
'72s. Regardless, I appreciate the swift response. I don't plan on
tackling the Weber to Solex effort until late Summer, so I have time to
find a '73 air cleaner... and figure out how everything goes together.
Prepare your answers, there'll be questions as sure as I'm sitting
here.
Thanks again,
