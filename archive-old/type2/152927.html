Subject: New distributer

Hi,

I have just received a new vacuum distrbiter from cip1 to replace a
009 that a garage recently fittted (it drives very flat). I have 'How
to Keep your volks alive' and it is very direct about using a
Tach/Dwell meter. I searched high and low in auto shops and I can't
seem to get one.

I want to fit the dizzy tomorrow, can anyone offer some advise on
fitting without a dwell meter?

yours

Charles Durrant

p.s. I also have a peertronic ingition to fit aswell.
