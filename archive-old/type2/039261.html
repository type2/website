My plans were to attend this weekend ,but due to things i can't control i'm 
not gonna make it, 1) my skinny a** is draggin, tomorrow will be 12 days 
straight no time off, and i'm just about wiped out .
2) they are supposed to hook up the new water supply to the house this sat, 
(Bailey the Rot in the front yard has to be contained that's  my job) 
3) I don't need the house flooded when i get back or calls in the nite from 
wife if i was there ,,heheheh so maybe in the fall, ya'll have fun and drink 
a cold one for me ,,later
