Had a problem with one of my rear wheels getting ridiculously hot last
night.
(I'd only driven a mile or so, on flat road, at about 40mph).
The paint on the wheel was beginning to bubble, it was that hot, :(

I limped her to the garage and eventually removed the wheel and drum, and
bearing grease seal &amp; bush.
One shoe is deeply scored, and there was lots of dust and what looked like
rust in the drum.
The grease in the bearings had melted, which allowed me to get a good look
at them in situ.
There seemed to be a strangely large gap in the roller bearing - almost
enough 'missing' to fit another 5 o 6 rollers.. is this as they come new?

I'm going to replace both the bearings and shoes - but which is to blame for
the excessive heat?

Phil Nuttall.
