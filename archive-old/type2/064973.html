&gt;
&gt; This looks like what was probably happening to my bus when the evil and
&gt; spitefull PO ripped out the horn wiring, and replaced it with a push-button
&gt; switch mounted on the steering column tube.
&gt;
&gt; I still haven't discovered how the horn wire passes through / around the
&gt; coupling disk.  I'm pretty sure it attaches to one of the bolts on the disk
&gt; and then another wire attaches to the lower end of the same bolt??  If so,
&gt; how does this lower wire keep from wrapping around the shaft of the steering
&gt; box when the steering wheel is turned all the way in one direction or the
&gt;other?
&gt;
&gt; It's no problem getting to where the problem is--'cuz I've removed
&gt; the ENTIRE steering system from the bus (from steering box to
&gt; steering wheel, and everything in between!).  In fact, the ENTIRE
&gt; bus is still gutted--running short on time.
&gt;
Rick -

Well, you made me go out an crawl under the truck. %^)

On mine, there's a wire from the horn which runs up through the floorboard
at the steering column and is attached to it (the outer &quot;sleeve&quot;) at the
bottom with a push-on connector. Since the outer part of the column does
not rotate, no problem. (This is the wire &quot;seeking ground.&quot; The other wire
from the horn is the hot wire which goes up to the fuse.)

Where the wire from the button is connected is a mystery to me, and I'm not
inclined to tear the thing apart just to find out how it works. (If it
works, don't fix it.) But it must lead to ground, if my memory of replacing
the horn button &quot;innards&quot; serves correctly.

Hope this helps
