Subject: Re: Air Fuel Ratio

Please do find it!  I would LOVE to have the proper fuel mixtures for
different RPM ranges!  It seems like this is the valuable information
that nobody seems to know, or hasn't said yet.

thanks,
mike

&gt; It is my understanding (FWIW) that a good quality DC voltmeter or
&gt; digital multimeter
&gt; connected to the existing O2 sensor  (if you have one) will work just
&gt; fine. The O2 sensor puts out 0-1 V from lean to rich and I have the
&gt; voltage range for the correct mixture strength somewhere if I could only
&gt; find it! I think it is available in the archives. Can anyone on the list
&gt; confirm this?
&gt; Thanks, Jack
