Subject: new generator brushes fail

On a 1600 with generator: I noticed the headlights flickering the other night.

I put a DVM across the battery terminals, and measured a voltage of 
12.4V with engine off. Normal for me.
Just after starting the engine the voltage jumps to 14V and decreases 
to 12.4V after a couple of minutes of running. A strange time 
dependence that I don't understand.

Before attacking the voltage regulator, I played with the generator.

I carried out the Bentley test of no-load generator output and got 
normal numbers: 13V at low rpm, 36V at higher rpm.

I don't have the equipment to carry out the loaded-generator test, 
so, remembering a previous situation with another VW, I removed the 
brushes,  replaced them with new ones, and repeated the no-load test. 
Zero volts output.

I put the old brushes back in and restored the normal 12V, 36V outputs.

Any ideas on the time dependence or any suggestions for why the new 
brushes gave this result?

Thanks, Jack
