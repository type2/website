Subject: engine case and stuff

I have an extra engine that the po gave to me with the car. Its mainly just 
the crankcase but I do have some heads for the engine althought they are 
messed up. anyways my question is how do I tell what type of engine I have 
(1600, 1700, etc.) Any help is appriciated. Also how much could I get for it 
if i was to sell it? Oh yeah and also does anyone know of any good VW junk 
yards in the southern california area. Thanks
