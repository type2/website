Subject: HCBF/BN4 heater FS

Howdy,

I will be at Hight Country Bus Fest this weekend and have a BN4 gas 
heater that needs a home. Included with the heater is the dash 
switch, firewall tin. and the ducting. The heater came uninstalled 
with a bus a a bought a while back. I was told it needs points for 
the fuel pump but have not messed with.  If anyone is interested in 
it I will haul it up the mountain. Asking $200 for everything.

Thanks

PS, Thanks in advance to Buddha for putting together another high 
quality/high country NC bus event!
