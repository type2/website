Subject: Re: [T2] Cargo Floor Questions.......

Bookwus1_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a few questions about the cargo floor (you know, just behind the rear
&gt; seat, made out of masonite and covered with a dense fabric) for my 7
&gt; passenger 1970 Bus.  The PO placed fiberglass insulation under the masonite
&gt; and then screwed the floor down.  This resulted in a very lumpy floor.
&gt; Question 1......._dot_can these lumps be removed from masonite by steaming or
&gt; some such method?
&gt; Question 2.......in a stock set-up is the floor screwed down?  Or is this
&gt; something the PO did when he put in the fiberglass insulation (I'm removing
&gt; that stuff)
&gt; Question 3.......assuming the answer to Question 1 is &quot;no way&quot; and I have to
&gt; make a new floor, what is the fabric which is glued to the masonite?
&gt; Question 4.......is this cargo floor available from any supplier?

The &quot;cargo floor&quot; you describe, if it's above the engine, sounds like a PO
field modification; my Bus didn't come with one and no Bus I've ever seen
has one. 

If you like this cargo floor except for the lumps, and it does sound like a
good thing (it would help cut engine noise, anyway), I would remove the
masonite, cut a piece of blue-foam insulation board to the shape of your
cargo floor and put that in place, cut a sheet of half-inch marine plywood
to shape and attach that over the blue foam, then carpet it with boat
carpet.
