Subject: RE: [T2] Broke Down

Perhaps a lump of dirt somewhere in the heating system got knocked
loose.

Check your heater system.

Is the belt damaged?

I think that you could risk cranking it up and listening for strange
sounds.

If you have to replace the belt, spin the generator by hand to see if
there's anything unusual.
