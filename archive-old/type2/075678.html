Subject: Re: [T2] Introduction and Starting Problems

&lt;&lt; You are suffering from the infamous ''hot start problem''. You will see 
people
 refer to it as the ''hard start problem'' but in reality, it will not crank 
when
 hot. &gt;&gt;

Hot, cold, doesnt matter, it wont crank reguardless of the temp. outside.  

&lt;&lt;Your problem is a major drop in voltage in the wiring. 
 Well, you can go thru every connection in the ignition/starter circuit and 
clean
 each one and make sure they are tight. ...
 you can install a relay at the solenoid. &gt;&gt;

I allredy have the relay in there, and it still wont start.
