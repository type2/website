&gt;basically you are describing what vw did with with sunroof busses/ double
door busses, dormobiles etc..They 
&gt;welded belly pans in to increase the ridgity of the bus to compensate for
the missing roof member that 
&gt;wasremoved  in the process of installing the sunroof
&gt;

What year did VW start doing this? was this a loaf-only mod? I don't think
the '67 westy I'm getting has belly pans.

Thanks! Joe
