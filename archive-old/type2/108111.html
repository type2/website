Subject: Re: [T2] Hole in floor for Sink Drain

&gt; Question:
 I have a 68 Westy and have removed the sink cabinet and jump seat to replace
 the vinyl with laminate.
 There is a 2&quot; hole,for the sink drain,in the floor and I need ideas on how to
 reduce the size of the hole to bring it closer to the approx. 1&quot; drain tube.I
 looks like there could have been a seal that reduced the opening but that's
 long gone. Any ideas?

Got a Home Depot/Lowes type home improvement center near you? 
Get a roof flashing for a vent pipe. It has a rubber seal. Put it facing down before installing the 
new laminate.
