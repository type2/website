But I have some questions;
1. The shifter has interesting movements and its a gamble 
as to which gearit goes into. which parts of the shifter
should I be looking at first?
---------------
&lt;&lt;There is a coupler at the back which couples the linkage
and the tranny. I dont know what yours looks like but on my
74 it is kind of U shaped with rubber bushings. The shift
linkage which runs from the front to the back is attached
to a short shaft coming out of the tranny. when the rubber
goes bad it will shift very weirdly. (weirdly?) anyway have
some one work the shifter up front as you lay under the bus
and watch the coupler. Clean this area up so you can see
what is really happening. the rod thaat goes to the tranny
should follow the movement of the shift rod. If not you can
get a replacement from Uncle Ron for like $15 or so.&gt;&gt;


------------
2. The engine seal is so-so how critical is it?
Helps keep the crap out of the engine bay.. critical in
dusty hot areas... important in all other driving
conditions.
I would stuff a new one in there soon if it is leaking
muchly. (muchly?). JMHO

Regular naps prevent old age.....
especially if you take them while driving.
