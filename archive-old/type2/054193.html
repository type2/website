Subject: Re: westfalia roof rack

A friend of mine carries three bikes (his mountain bike, his bmx bike and
his wife's mountain bike) on the front part of the roof of his westy. He
rigged it up somehow to pivot foward (but keep the bikes on it) when he
opened up his pop-top. I can't seem to remember how he did it, but I do
know that it is possible. I'll see if I can't get in touch with him and
find out exactly how he did it.
