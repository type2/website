Subject: lucas oil lube

After looking at the evidence on the responses I received on this.

 

I have decided to take the whole bottle back.

 

It can easily be seen that it increases viscosity to the point of
uselessness at startup at least. It also promotes extra foaming of the oil.

 

I am curious about the lucas fuel treatment.

 

My choice of oil is 20W50 Castrol for the bus and 0W40 for the jeep and
golf.

 

Cheers,

 

Alan
