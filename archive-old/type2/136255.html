Subject: Re: [T2] Department of how bad ...

&gt; It tightens as you turn the wrench to loosen the
&gt; filter. I've used it
&gt; on a bunch of cars and haven't found one it won't
&gt; work on yet, though
&gt; I suppose the big diesel filters might be too big
&gt; for it. ;-)

I also have an oil wrench similer to this one that Don
mentioned
http://www.midwayautosupply_dot_com/detailedproductdescription.asp?2055,
but mine has like 3 fingers that fit over the filter.
The more you twist with the wrench the tighter it
grips. I bought mine at my local NAPA parts store for
around $6.99. I have also used every type of filter
wrench I could find to fit my bus, but when I got my
westy, I tried to change the oil, nothing I had would
take the filter off, so I went to napa and they showed
me this tool. When I got home it took only a couple
turns of the wrench to get it off.
Here is the napa site=

Hope this helps.
