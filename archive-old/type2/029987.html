Blow-by wouldn't put oil in the exchangers, but leaky valve cover gaskets
will.  I doubt that it is half a quart, though.  Oil spreads out a lot
when it has a flat surface to work with.

Be sure the wire bails on the valve covers are springy and put in new
valve cover gaskets every time you have the covers off and you'll do fine.
