Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

Matty Kirk sends:

&gt; im considering trying to swap out my 2.0 Type IV for the 1.6 Diesel that is in
&gt; my rabbit. i remember reading an artical once about a guy who put a GTI engine
&gt; in a diesel vanagon with good results. i know that a vanagon is already setup
&gt; for water cooloing however i have a variety of ideas of how to work that out.

I don't think I've ever heard of anyone converting a gas bus to run that VW
1.6l diesel. Let's start with the 47 brake horsepower the 1.6l Rabbit diesel
puts out. 

Lots of people have put gasoline Rabbit engines in the diesel Vanagons--if
you change out the oil pan, they go in okay. The other way around is no
good--the Bus gets real slow in short order.
