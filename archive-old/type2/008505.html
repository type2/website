&gt;thanks for all the replys. I think I know where to check the fuse now.
&gt;However, when hooking it up. How do I know which wire is ground? I
&gt;don't have anything to check to see which one is hot and which one is
&gt;not. 
&gt;When it comes to electrical stuff..I'm a complete idiot.
&gt;
&gt;On my sink pump it has two wires coming out. One wire says connect to
&gt;positive. coming from the bus there are two wires just hanging there.
&gt;How would I know what wire to connect to the other wire? I can't
&gt;believe I'm having so much trouble with this. I thought it would be
&gt;easy.

Since you have no test equipment.....cheat!
Your pump has 2 wires and you have 2 wires hanging. Connect one pump 
wire to a hanging wire and the other pump wire to the other hanging 
wire. Fill water tank. Turn on pump. 
Got water coming out of faucet?
If yes: you got them right! 
If no: reverse wires!
