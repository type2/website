&gt; I have actually taken this culture a step farther. i carry a few

&gt; sometimes 
&gt; i'll park by a bus and add on pieces that are missing, just to make 
&gt; up for 
&gt; the karma of people who are stealing pieces. what a nice surprise to 
&gt; have a 
&gt; &quot;lost&quot; hubcap find it's way home...
&gt; keep it real,
