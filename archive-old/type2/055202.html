Subject: Re: racing steering wheel

Jessica A ALLEN sends:

&gt; Anyone replaced the huge steering whell with something smaller
&gt; and more car like? Do you have to do too many turns on a smaller
&gt; wheel. Just a case of changing wheels over or do you have to
&gt; adjust other things as well?

Before you replace the steering wheel in your Bus, watch Sunday's Winston
Cup race from Pocono. Pay especial attention to in-car shots of Mark Martin
going through a turn. (If they don't put a camera in the 6 this weekend,
Mark Martin steers the car by putting his hands together and leaning into
the wheel with all his might.)

If you don't want to be like Mark Martin, at least in this respect, leave
the wheel the size it is.
