Subject: Re: 79 091 Tranny and 2 Litre into 73 swap

I went the other way (002 gearbox instead of 091) and had no problems 
getting into all the gears. You just wouldn't want to have short arms!

Cheers,

Martin.

 &gt;What's not clear in the FAQ is if the shifter being moved
closer to you makes it in-operable, or less functional.  If this simply
brings the shifter closer to the driver, but doesn't impede shifting into
the gears, is it really a problem?  Having the shifter a little closer
sounds great!  Does this move put the shifter in a position too far back to
catch 2nd, 4th, and reverse?
