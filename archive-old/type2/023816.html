Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Injection Fuel Pump

Ford pick-ups, F-150s and rangers 1985 to 1988 have externally mounted bosch
fuel pumps on the frame.  They are cheap and quite common and I'm using one
on my 79, 2.0 F.I. bus with no problems.

&gt; &gt;I am transplanting a late model Fuel Injection system into my 74. I
&gt; &gt;understand the standard FI fuel pump delivers fuel at around 28 psi.
&gt; &gt;After pricing a correct VW pump $$$$ is there a less expensive
&gt; &gt;alternative such as a Purolator or Facet that will fulfill the pressure
&gt; &gt;requirements?
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, those pumps put out over 60 lbs, which is controlled by the
&gt; regulator to a running pressure of 28-32 lbs. Your looking for nothing but
&gt; problems to use other than Bosch parts in a Bosch system. Why are those
&gt; pumps so expensive??? That's what it takes to make a pump that will last
&gt; 15-20 years. I have seen generic pumps used a few times. In every case
&gt; they
&gt; were VERY noisy and the fuel and lines carry that noise throughout the
&gt; system. Any noise other than a very subdued hum from a Bosch pump means it
&gt; will probably fail soon. Sometimes, it's just a clogged filter that make
&gt; the pump work very hard and brings on their demise.
&gt; 
&gt; I would try a used Bosch pump from the salvage yard before trying
&gt; something
&gt; else if I couldn't afford to fix it right with a new pump. Odds are it
&gt; will
&gt; work long enough to sell the Bus to the unsuspecting, or just might
&gt; outlast
&gt; a new wannabe pump.
&gt; 
&gt; Know also that your conversion to FI on an original carbed chassis will
&gt; require plumbing a return fuel line to the tank, or replacement of the
&gt; tank
&gt; with a FI tank. The time/money to do that right could well exceed the cost
&gt; of a new Bosch pump.
&gt; 
&gt; An FI 2.0 liter is a very good way to go and probably worth the effort.
&gt; Probably the easiest way to pick up some extra horse power without
&gt; diminishing longevity. However, just putting FI on the 1.7, 1.8 carbed
&gt; engine could get a bit problematic. No provision for a temp sensor mount,
&gt; ECU mount, pressure regulator mount, air filter mount, yadayadayada. Be
&gt; prepared to spend time/money getting all this fit up.
