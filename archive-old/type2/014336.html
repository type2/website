&gt; Well, that makes mine different than either of them. It has the  BA-6 but no

&gt; Where I'm headed with all this is that I'd like to install a  fresh air fan,
&gt; especially since an upcoming job is replacing one of the wiper transmissions,
&gt; which means taking out the dash and air distributor box anyway. I have access
&gt; to an 82 parts car.

I'll bet that (a) this will be easy) but (b) will involve swapping way
more bits than you think at the outset :-)

&gt; I hope the whole air distributor box will just interchange.

Yeah, sure it will but you might have to swap the whole dash to get the
mount points you need :-)

&gt; BTW, what's up with this metal 80-only air intake you mentioned?

OK, as I heard it....  the air intakes at the upper rear corners of the
bus were a metal grill in 1980 only.  In 1981 and later years, that was a
rectangular cutout with a plastic insert.  I am certain given VW's &quot;mid
year change&quot; policy that there is at least one 1981 out there with metal
vents.
