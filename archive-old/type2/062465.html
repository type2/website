&gt;Now for a question:  Every one keeps mentioning &quot;Hypoid&quot; oil.
&gt;What is this? I did not see any mention of this on the oil I 
&gt;bought but it said for use in transmissions, gearboxes, and 
&gt;differentials.  Do I need &quot;Hypoid&quot; (I seem to recall Hypoid having 
&gt;something to do with high pressure) oil or will plain old 80w-90 
&gt;work?
&gt;Thanks, Brett

Hypoid rated gear lube is needed for the ring-gear and pinion in 
the differential due to the fact that these two gears have faces 
that slide against each other.  FYI, the teeth in well designed 
gear sets roll on each other, they aren't supposed to have any 
sliding friction.  The sliding friction in hypoid gears creates 
extremely high surface temperature on the metal.  Ordinary oils 
will break down at the extreme temperature extant on the tooth 
faces of the hypoid gears.

Hypoid gear sets for automobile &quot;3rd members&quot;, &quot;finals&quot; or 
&quot;rear-ends&quot; were developed to lower the drive shaft in the 
conventional front-engine, rear wheel drive cars ca 1930.  IMHO, 
most gear-case lube sold today is hypoid rated, but don't trust me 
on that one, ask a lube engineer.
