Subject: Re: Fwd: Re: [T2] auxiliary air regulator characteristics

See that little nut on there?  Loosen that and then using a screwdriver 
push it one way or another and it will adjust it one way or the other 
(it changes the axis that the vane opens on) and then tighten it when 
you're satisfied.  I moved mine so it got as much air through as I 
could.  Also, there's nothing magical inside it.  I've taken mine 
completely apart and put it back together.  It's just a bi-metallic 
plate that has coils wrapped around it.  When it gets hot it bends the 
plate and pushes the disk to open.  I wouldn't recommend taking it 
apart, though, because you need to insert it at the correct angle or it 
won't work quite right.

And yeah, it should open up in the freezer.  Here's what mine looked 
like (I think this was after it was in the freezer).  I took this a 
loooooong time ago so I forgot how cold it was, but that is a 
significant opening, so it probably was in the freezer.

&gt; I would like to spray Kroil onto the disc mechanism, but I wouldn't want 
&gt; this to drip onto the heater coil. Do you happen to know if the coil is 
&gt; in a separate compartment from the disc?
