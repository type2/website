Subject: lorax the 80 vanagan

Hi, 
I had originally written to ask about the post in the archives about gas
tanks(-I couldn't acess, it.),what to do with the condensation problem
from a van sitting for a year. We pull started  the van w/
stabilzer(white gas) or some thing added to the tank insted of draining
it, things went pretty good sputtering and a spitting we rolled home.
The damage list (from the neighborhood kids) grew unfortunately...
windshield, tail lights, side view mirrors, passanger window(not the
wing thank god!) So my mother knew _at_ this other v`gon that she chose now
to tell me about it.-- 81 that was rebuildt and new heat exch. and comes
w/ another motor for 500   so I  think it would be good if we could
combine the 3 to get the smooth running machine...If these are
compatable cool because I'd like to use the windsheild and all but I
don't know if it'll fit    anyone out there with lots of V'gans know
