Subject: Re: Circuit breaker

I think if you take the cover off the box, you'll see the circuit breaker is a
Square D item (mine is)...take it out and use as a sample at your local
electrical supplier...they should be able to match it for you...

Good luck...Den

&gt; I want to replace the non functioning circuit breaker on the electrical =
&gt; outlet in my 73 Westfalia. The electrical connection is functional, =
&gt; works when plugged in, but the button for the circuit breaker is =
&gt; obviously not working.
&gt; Are there any sources for a replacement?
&gt; Oh, and does anyone have the 2 button Westy lamp fixture they would like =
&gt; to sell?
&gt;
