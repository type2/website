Subject: Re: [T2] &amp;*^&amp;!!!! oil filter length and removal]

Try one of these:

or one of these:

or, just jab one of these in your filter and spin if you're really
desperate (worked for me before I had the above tools):

The only problem with the last option is you have to use a hammer to
puncture the filter which might put stress on the mount.  Use at your
own risk.

I haven't had any problems getting my filters off of my 78 and they've
all been relatively short Mahle filters.

Also, how tight are you screwing the filter on?  It should be hand tight.

thanks,
Mike

&gt; What brands are people using? Mine is an all black filter can with the VW

&gt; my wrench can't get a good grip. Is there a longer QUALITY filter out
&gt; there??
