hahahahahaa! Ranks right up there with me (the cigar chewing afficinado)
wearing a Phillies Blunt T-Shirt to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. (my old
job) on &quot;casual day.&quot; I got some very strange looks and I thought it odd
that no one really wanted to talk to me that day. Mysteriously, I found
myself participating in the &quot;random&quot; screening process in the weeks that
followed. Hmmmmm. The only thing that they found was nicotine. 
I didn't discover the &quot;Hip&quot; nuance to the shirt until much later.
I was tested 3 times in as many years while employed there while some of the
old hats hadn't been tested in twenty years. Driving splitty buses and being
naive of my choices of apparel &quot;may&quot; have been the factors.

In June at a pre-VW Classic campout with the Box on Wheels club, a couple of
their members gave out a statement of surprise and discomfort when they
walked up on my brother in law and I smoking cigars. I didn't immediately
clue in on their concern and then reassured them that yes, the cigars were
simply cigars, &quot;dudes.&quot;

Some stickers and t-shirts are best kept in the garage.
