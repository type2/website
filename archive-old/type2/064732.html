Subject: Re: my emblem is plastic!!!!

&gt;Hey, i took my VW emblem off of the front of my bus before i brought it to
&gt;the place to get painted, and it's *PLASTIC*!!!!!!!!!

&gt;this is news to me, but did any of you know that?

Darn. You caught us. We knew it the whole time.

Wait'll you find the dead mouse we put in your tackle box. ;)
