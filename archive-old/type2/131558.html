Subject: RE: [T2] Generator pulley nut

&gt;From: &quot;Kathy and Paul&quot;

&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;     Just thought I'd pass on a quick tip I found out the hard way.
&gt;You see, a couple of weekends ago I drove out to Westies In The Woods
&gt;and after arrival discovered my generator belt looser than I'd like
&gt;it.  So, Saturday right after dinner and before the campfire I broke
&gt;out my tool box to adjust the generator pulley shims.  Well to my
&gt;surprise I discovered that my socket for the generator pulley nut was
&gt;AWOL.  My first thought was to go around begging for the proper tools,
&gt;I'm sure someone would have had them.  Second thought was to try and
&gt;get it done with what I had.  After all, what would I have done if I
&gt;wasn't at a VW event?  To my pleasant surprise I found that a 13/16,
&gt;12 point, spark plug socket is a good fit on the generator pulley nut.
&gt;A 6 point socket may work too but I can't say for sure as I haven't
&gt;tried one on there yet.  With the belt adjusted I was able to relax
&gt;and enjoy the rest of the evening.

I have had similar situations with trying to get my nuts off. Depending on 
the accessability of the nut or bolt head you can use a openended side of a 
box wrench that is slightly larger the the nut and wedge a flathead 
screwdriver in there to make up for the play. The trick is to wedge it in 
there perpendicular to the wrench.

TravelOn,
