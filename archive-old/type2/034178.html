Subject: Oh yes, the wonderfull smell of gas

I researched the archives for gas smells and found some usefull info
but not my particular situation. I was filling up the other day and noticed
gas pouring out of the left side of my 79 by the bumper after the tank
became full. I pushed my bus to an out of the way spot and did an inspection.
Looking into the engine compartment, the far left-hand side was soaked
with gas. I reached up the tubes that lead into the airscoop to see if
they were wet with gas and they weren't. I guess the gas must be coming
from the overflow vent farther back. Any one have any ideas about common
placed this leak might occur and access points?
Thanks Casey
