It takes a certain amount of energy, heat, to push the bus through the air at
60 MPH.  The VW's cooling system is based upon engine speed.  Over size
tires, or a higher geared final drive ratio will cause the cooling fan to
turn slower and remove fewer BTUs from the engine at a given highway speed.
The bus will run hotter. And actually, you may not see an increase in fuel
economy as you may find it now takes a larger throttle opening to maintain
your speed.
