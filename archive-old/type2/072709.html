&gt;Well, I found two wires not connected to anything. Hmmmm....maybe there's
&gt;a connection between these and why my bus will only start briefly. Using
&gt;an ohm meter, I was able to get 0 resistance between one wire and pin 9 of
&gt;the ECU plug...which maps to pin 9 of the intake air sensor. The other
&gt;wire shows 0 resistance to pin 12 of the ECU. Problem is, I can't figure
&gt;out where/how to hook these up.


Joe:

Sounds like the infamous Altitude Switch circuit.  Does your bus or the
original donor have a toggle switch mounted on the top mounting bolt on the
ECU.  Do these two wires exit the harness in the same place as the # 1 wire
to the coil?  If so that's what it is.  If you don't have the switch to
connect it to, you can purchase a simple on off toggle at a hardware store.
You're at sea level right?  Closing the circuit should make your mixture
richer, thus compensating for the denser air and it will run better.  Have
you had problems with lean running? Blown engines, dropped valve seats,
etc?

Where did this bus or the donor originallly come from?  Does it have a 018 AFM?

Let me know.  Have fun
