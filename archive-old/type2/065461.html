Subject: Fuel injection and front oil seal 2.0L

Hey folks,

I hate to be bothering everybody with a repeat question, but I didnt get even
one response back on these questions.  I KNOW there's someone out there who
can help me, PLEASE, PLEASE PLEEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

Ive even reviewed them and tried to make them more complete and less vague.
 Thanks in advance....

Fuel Injection questions...

I am in the process of redoing the fuel system on a 2.0 FI engine.  Maybe you
all can answer some qestions, please.

1.  How do I clean my fuel injectors?  Do I soak them, wipe them down, or
just leave them alone?  if I soak them, in what?  There pretty grungy on the
outside, but do they even need cleaning?  

2.Anyone know what material the intake manifolds are made of?  Can I repaint
them? after cleaning them, a lot of paint came off.  Some of the metal looks
tarnished like brass, some looks like steel (where thepaint is freshly
removed, right next to the brass area) and other areas look rusted.  These
areas are all on the same metal tube, so it is the same metal (duh).  I
sealed the inside of the gas tank with some POR-15 gas tank sealer.  Do I use
this same stuff on the inside of the tubes?  Do I just clean up the outsides
and repaint? Do I leave it alone?  Also, these tubes (and the air sensor box
thingy area) had a light film of oil or some such in them.  Is this
indicative of anything?

3.Do the injectors need to go back in the same cylinders?Do I need to replace
the little rubber gaskets?  Where can I find these?


4. Can I reuse the gaskets on the intake manifolds at the head?  If so, do I
put some permatex on them?  If not, where can I find just those gaskets?

Oil seal questions...

I've heard (and read) a lot about how to put the oil seal back in, but have
not seen anywhere about how to get the old one out.  Does anyone have any
suggestions? 
I dont want to do any damage. 

When I'm replacing the seal after removing the old one, Do I use any sealer
when 
I put it back in? (I'm using a press to put it back in)

Thanks for all your help.
