Subject: Where is the VINTAGVW list?

I hope this is close enough to Friday (I wish I was in Austrailia!!!!)

It sure is nice to be back on the list.  I was on a few years back while
I was at school.  My old e-mail address was dprobins_at_pepperdine_dot_edu, but
now that I've graduated, I havn't had e-mail, so I couldn't wait any
longer so I signed up with JUNO, which is great, btw.

I sold my bus (1973 7-pass, Magi) and bought a 1967 bug.  I am trying to
subscribe to the VINTAGVW list, and have received confirmation of my
subscription, but it has been  a week and not a single message has been
posted that I can find!!!  Can anyone help me with this?  

Thanks for your help and thanks for letting me lurk, bus-less.
