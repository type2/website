Subject: Re: [T2] braided Brake Booster Hose

The problem with 1/2&quot; (12mm fuel vapor/smog hose is that it is not wire
reinforced to deal with the large vacuum pressure exerted by the servo when
the brakes are used and it sometimes collapes.  Thick walled fuel hose means
nothing unless it is reinforced to withstand 300psi fuel pressure and then
you would not have this potential problem.  Karl is right that the plastic
tube is used on Late 74-79 Type 2s (and subsequently on 80-91 Vanagons), but
it's not usually immediately available even from the local VW dealer (I know
it's not from mine two blocks away).

I have been using 1/2&quot; Oil Cooler Hose for over 15 years now on my
Power/Servo Brake applications regardless of the year.  In addition this
size is also used on Type 1 68-75 Auto-Stick Transmission Servos from the
Intake Manifold.  Oil Cooler Hose is more than adequate in reinforced wall
strength that it won't collapse/implode under large vacuum pressures.  Oil
Cooler Hose is a lot more easier and less expensive to use than the factory
VW Reinforced hose.

Just my 2 cents worth.

&gt; I used 1/2 inch ID fuel hose.  Worked fine.  The stuff that I used didn't
&gt; go flat since it had a decent wall thickness.  The local farm supply place
&gt; sells the same hose for hydralic use as well but it looks like high pressure
&gt; big bore fuel line.  If you have a problem with the stuff that you get you
&gt; can put a 1/2 inch spring in it to keep it from colapsing.  This also works
&gt; for tight radius bends.  Don't forget the stretch attaching the metal tube
&gt; hose to the brake booster at the front end.  A leak there will make it
&gt; inpossible to get a stable idle.
