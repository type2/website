Subject: Re: [T2] '79 vs Earlier Heater boxes.

From Stevie Havoc:

&gt; So, other than the port shape, what causes them to cost $50.00 to  
 70.00 more than the earlier Heat Exchangers?

My guess:  one-year-only and Fed version is different from Calif version.
Limited to one-year-only status raises the price.

&gt; Do they actually produce more heat ? (more efficient)

Not that I know of. Appear to be made the same as 78 and back. 
Maybe it is a claim added on to the one-year-only status to justify the price? 

&gt; Last longer ? (better materials).

Not that I have seen.....

&gt; I'm unsure about the benefits of the '79 exchanger design versus earlier, other than port shape. 

79 Calif is required because of the O2 sensor.
