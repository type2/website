Mike,

This specific problem has actually been discussed in a previous 
tune-up/dist/timing thread on one of these lists.  If you have are having a 
problem with your dist. not returning all the way to the correct_idle_ spark 
advance, it needs to be disassembled and cleaned.

Dirt, crud, etc. is causing the springs, weights and other advance parts to 
not quite return to their &quot;at rest&quot; low rpm positions.  Disassemble it to the 
degree that you are comfortable, clean it up good with solvent, work 
everything around well and relubricate (per Bentley) with a bit of motor oil.
