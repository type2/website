Subject: Vac Trouble Question

Yesterday I solved the vac leak in my egr system. The PO had plugged it at
the egr but not on the throttle housing  so I did that and seemed much
better.  While I was at this I used the vac hose pic/diagram posted on the
Type2 sight and was surprised how my hose set up did not resemble it at all.
Seems the PO had placed a  temp switch  page 32 in the Bentley Fuel Inj
section on a line between the Decel valve and the egr valve  I took it all
apart and made my hoses look like those in the diagram and she ran very well
for the first time  steady idle  my question is what is this switch  do I
need it  I cant seem to find any info about it in Bentley other then a
picture.  All I know is when the switch was on half my hoses didnt seem to
have any vac.

Thanks
