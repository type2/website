&gt;FWIW, the rear blade - not the brackets - is the same from '66 - '72.

&gt;actually, though they look similar, they  arent the same.  Even without
&gt;overriders.   The brackets are different, the set up for overriders is
&gt;different, and the shape is also somewhat different.

Hi, Clara.......  :&lt;)
(somehow I knew you were gonna prove me wrong!!   :&lt;)

(just kidding......   :&lt;)

Anyway, I know the brackets are different.......I know the overriders are
different........and I know the placement, and the amount of holes in the rear
bumper aren't the same either......BUT,  I have held a stripped down '68-'72
rear bumper directly over a stripped down '66-'67 rear bumper ---- and they are
Identical.
All I know is what I saw.  Have you ever tried this?

no mean to cause a commotion, but I gotta somehow believe I was NOT blind,
drunk, or just plain stoopid, when I did this....   :&lt;)

ok, maybe a little ....  :&lt;)
