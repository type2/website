You may be &quot;lucky&quot; and have a problem I have encountered.  Sounds
exactly like it.  In my case, the clutch center became detached from the
rest of the disk, the part with the springs on it &quot;parted out&quot; and there
was no change in the feel of the clutch, just couldn't get any movement
out of the bus, even with &quot;speed shift&quot; techniques.  It went nicely into
all gears once stopped, but just wouldn't &quot;go&quot;.  A simple replacement of
the clutch disk did it.  Since you say you  have a new clutch, it
springs right to mind (always check the last thing you fixed is a mantra
of us professional troubleshooters.)

&gt; Dear list,
&gt; Driving home today from work when all the sudden, while cruising in 3rd
&gt; gear, BANG.... (engine revving due to no load being put on it..) grind
&gt; grind........ press clutch and it feels exactly the same..... No gear gives
&gt; me any reaction...... coast to a stop, do a visual inspection..... looks
&gt; all entact...... clutch feels exactly the same..... (new clutch, p plate &amp;
&gt; t o bearing). Get a tow home and am feeling under the weather so I haven't
&gt; drained that gear lube to see if there are chunks in there.......  Doesn't
&gt; it sound like a transaxle gone baaad??
