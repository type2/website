&gt;I have been watching this with some interest since I

&gt;rebuilt will this be a good match for a '79 bus or
&gt;will this also pose the similar concerns surrounding
&gt;the 912 engine?

The 914 engine is basically the same as the 72-79 bus engines. A few listmembers are running them in their busses.
