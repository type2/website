Try adjusting your clutch.  Before my clutch cable broke, it would
stre-e-e-etch and I'd have to adjust it back up.  I would know when to do
this because with the clutch all the way to the floor, first was next to
impossible to find.  Finally when the cable broke, that problem went
away&lt;grin&gt;.  Now it won't engage any of them!!

&gt;
&gt;hi all. i'm having an annoying problem with my '77 westy.
&gt;it is really difficult to get the transmission into first
&gt;gear. it requires a lot of feeling around and a fair amount
&gt;of force to get it in. this is sometimes embarrasing at
&gt;stop signs when i'm sitting there wrestiling with the
&gt;shifter. i have this problem regardless of whether i'm
&gt;stopped or rolling. second gear is also a little difficult
&gt;to get into, but it &quot;snaps&quot; into place much easier than
&gt;first. third and fourth have no problems at all. does
&gt;anyone know what these symptoms indicate? since it's both
&gt;first and second, might there be a problem with one of the
&gt;synchros? or could this be an issue with the shift rods
&gt;being out of whack? please don't tell me i have to have the
&gt;tranny rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt;cheers,
&gt;ben
