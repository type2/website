Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT SOS

Encourage him to find an axle at an Auto Zone and to buy the wrench for the 
socket head screws.

A good pair of vise grips to force the bolts off if the socket head wrench 
won't do it's job.

The axle can be swapped with the bus on the ground or slightly raised 
(tires on the ground) with a jack. The idea is to raise the bus a little 
and not create a safety hazard when the bus might fall on him.

It doesn't require a mechanic if he has basic mechanical skills and doesn't 
mind getting dirty. Not better time than the present to learn this process.

I once changed a clutch in my Beetle while visiting northern Italy in the 
parking lot with some scrap wood and two scissor jacks. In the process of 
removing the engine, I bent the lower studs and spent 4 hours trying to 
figure out why the engine would not slide back on the tranny. In the end 
several folks stopped by to help (though none knew anything about cars). My 
sister and her friend were running gopher duties and a BIG German tour bus 
was waiting nearby. The driver (without me asking) maneuvered the bus to 
behind my Beetle and left the engine idle and ALL the lights on so I could 
see (it got dark). He spoke no English and knew nothing about cars but was 
eager to hold my flashlight and hand me tools. Great guy. Wish I could meet 
him again and thank him again.

Do we know if the axle is literally sheared or one of the CV joints has 
exploded?

If he doesn't want to do the work himself - ANY - mechanic can do this job.

Will require tow job to local gas station and possibly a little guidance.

Wish I could help more but I am 9 hours away...
