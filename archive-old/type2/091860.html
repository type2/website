Subject: RE: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

Johnathan,
I believe that there must be a variable in the fixed extinguisher
temperature nozzle.
Why?
Because boats use them, and they too get awfully hot below in the engine
compartment.

I don't know what it may be but it most certainly gets very hot below
decks, running WFO with a small or big block power---

I think that a remote setup is a good idea.
especially a remote Halon setup--

Later,

Terry

Too bad most fixed systems are set to blow off around 175 degrees
farenheight, id say the engine compartment of a bus gets a little hotter
than that(Im not totally sure, so if you know otherwise please correct
me). If it was higher it might have great potential in preventing fires
in there.
