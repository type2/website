Subject: Re: strange engine power loss

Ok folks a problem that has been bugging me for a couple weeks now, 
my 78 (more or less) stock FI bus with auto tranny has had no power
(relatively speaking) and I am at a loss to find the problem...

symtoms, no power on acceleration.

. top speed is normal, once it gets there
. dwell is dead on (pentronix)
. plugs look new, light grey 
. oil presure  is actually a little high, 50-60lbs
. temp stays down
. runnning a little rich
. AFM checks out
. recently changed the fuel filter 
. am having auto tranny problems but I am seperating them out
. fuel economy is down a little (possibly because I'm running a little
rich)
. it was running lean and it was the same, I will get it on am slowly
adjusting it
. no unusual sounds
. no smells
. no vibration
. no backfire or shuttering

I could normally beat a city bus away from a traffic light, today an empty
transit bus beat out of the hole! ;8*{  

**things I'm suspicious of**

. accelerator linkage has slipped (can't get passing gear, and auto tranny
linkage is on the side of the tranny)
. air leak (but have searched and can't find anything)
. timings off (still, have adjusted with timing light)
. Vacuum advance in dizzy is sticking or not advancing (but why would it
run fine at 65 once it gets there)

.????? other ideas????
what am I missing????

this ones got me stumped and it is driving me bonkers

thanks for the help
Bob
