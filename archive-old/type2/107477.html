Subject: Smog Results

A couple folks asked for the results of my CA smog test. Here they are:

'77 Westy
2.0L FI (originally CA equiped)
Working EGR w/ new filter(was blocked off by PO, but in good shape)

		%C02		%O2		HC(PPM)	%CO		NO(PPM)

15 MPH	14.7		0.0		46		0.82		20
25 MPH	14.4		0.0		51		1.09		13

All numbers were below average, except 25mph HC was a littla above average
(maybe the rings aren't quite seated?). All were well within spec. The test
was done by College Smog Check on College Av. in San Diego. I didn't do
anything special on the engine assembly, other than follow directions from
Bentley and the List. I was told by the mechanic who checked it out prior
that a poor seal on the gas cap is a common failure point.
