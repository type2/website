&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm using Michlin 185-R 14&quot; Tires, sidewall also says 91T M7S

&gt; &gt; It means that they are underspec. for your bus: the load rating
&gt; &gt;is not high enough and they are likely to fail prematurely. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to interject in these matters in general, FWIW I've owned
&gt; more buses than most of you have likely, and more Vanagons, and
&gt; a lot of them have come with passenger car tires.  It isn't right, maybe
&gt; they are more likely to fail catastrophically, but I've put a lot of miles
&gt; on a lot of these tires.  Some have failed catastrophically, Sears
&gt; Roadhandler SCR's by Michelin come to mind.  Other are as solid
&gt; 50k on as 6 ply raters (some of the Dunlop SP5s? come to mind.)

After I separated two passenger tires in the space of 100 miles, I saw the
light and started to insist upon the correct tires.  Try finding a 185R14
load range D tire in Bishop, California on a Sunday!  That experience cost
me lots of hassle and $25 for another worn out passenger tire i discarded
after 200 more miles.

If you do _nothing_ but drive around town, you will get by fine with
passenger tires, but the danger zone is when you take that first highway
trip after the weather warms up.
