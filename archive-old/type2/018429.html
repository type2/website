I did a archive search and came up short, and it wasn't on my Hoover
disc.  So I got a question for the list.

I recently took apart my top end with the hope of only rebuilding the
heads and honing the cylinders.  That is till I got a look at the cam.

Well I have delved into a complete rebuild.  Got the engine fully apart
and have a problem or poor memory.  It has been a awhile since the last
rebuild I did.

I can not remember how to get the distributor and cam gears off the
crank.  I got the clip off, one right beside the distributor. gear.  I'm
afraid to bang it off for fear of damaging the gears.  And like I said I
can't remember how I did it before.

Any help or suggestion (or reminders) would help.

Thanks
Brent
