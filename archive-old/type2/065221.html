Sorry. He did mention that there are products that do not contain 
isocynates. At this time they do not seem to hold up quite as well, but 
are FAR better than paints 5 years ago. This was a retail store, and 
with shop discounts (our used to get up to 25%) the paint guns would be 
cheaper than the $250. He was using this as the suggested retail price 
by Sharpe.

Back when Duron and other catalized paints first started coming out, we 
all used standard carbon-filter masks. You just have to be sure the 
filters are new, and the mask must fit VERY securely. If you smell the 
paint, you are being poisoned.

The scuba idea is a good one. A friend of mine did that. Just be sure 
you cover the tank and guages carefully before starting.
