Subject: Type IV Engine stands

Hello All

I recently bought a 72 westy.  tinkered with it, pulled it
and tried to make it run well.  Well I have determined it
needs a rebuild.  No problem.  However, I have an engine
stand I used on the upright engines.  Once I put a type IV
on it and it scared me.  Does not look sturdy enough to hold
it, the ear pieces that actually connect to the case.  So I
looked in some catalogs and found only the same thing.  All
listed as stands for upright engines.

Am I being a worry wart? This thing does not, did not, look
strong enough to hold the larger engine. Where can I get one
that does hold a type IV engine, or are there any thing that
has been done to have one work.  I don't have access to
welding though.

Also as a result the 79 engine I have for sale is no longer
for sale.  It will be going in my bus, with the approporate
changes, till I get the 72 rebuilt.  Then it will be for
sale again.

Any help is appreciated.

Brent
