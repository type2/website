&gt;&gt; - The 'hand-brake' on an automatic is often a foot-pedal. That makes it a
&gt;&gt; bit awkward in hill-starts.
&gt; 
&gt; Many US cars have a parking brake that is a foot pedal located off to the
&gt; left side of the footwell.  You can still use it for hill starts, as the
&gt; brake release is a pull-knob.

Why would you *need* to use the parking brake to hill-start the car if you
have an automatic transmission?

Automatics have two pedals--one makes the car go faster, one makes it go
slower--and a torque converter (hydraulic clutch) instead of a mechanical
clutch. 

To hill-start a car with a torque converter, you'll be stepping on the brake
to keep the car from moving. When the light turns green, step on the gas and
slowly let off the brake. You'll go just fine.
