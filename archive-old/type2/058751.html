Subject: Sorry abut Gus...

Marv:

Only people who have had the good fortune to be buddied with a good dog know how you feel
right now.  I'm really sorry about Gus.  When my 13 1/2 year-old Newfoundland, Eli, got
cancer and had to be put down, it was a hard time.  He loved busses, too.  Used to lie on
the back seat of my Westie and rest his chin on the top of the seat, staring out the back
window(Newfies are BIG dogs!), which generally freaked out the people driving behind...  I
got a new Newfie puppy, a girl named Matilda.  She's not Eli, but she IS herself.  She
loves busses too.  Get yourself another dog.  Fortunately, the world is full of loving,
happy dogs that need a special relationship with someone who can appreciate the bond.
