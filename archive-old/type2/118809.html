Subject: Re: [T2] Hi Listers I'm Back!!! need engine info...

From: Da Bus LaBarge

&gt; is there a differance between a &quot;1600cc Bug engine&quot; and a &quot;1600cc Bus engine&quot;????
 If I have a &quot;1600cc Bug engine&quot; what would I have do to put it in 1970 bus??

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

If it is an original bug case, then you will not have the 3 holes in the case below the crank pully for the
rear support bar.  There was a mickey mouse bar on the market that allowed you to use a bug engine in a bus,
but the bar used the tiny oil pump studs. NOT a good idea. I would never use one.
