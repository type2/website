&gt; I always leave approximately one vehicle length for every 10 mph, but only
&gt; out of habit.  That's what they were teaching back in my day at high school
&gt; driver education.  I try to remember the 3-4 second rule, as it's a better
&gt; gauge for safety, but I tend to fall back on old habits.

well one of my first jobs out of the service was driving the big charter
buses and they taught us, 1 second for every 10 ft of vehicle length,
since we had mostly 40 ft buses the 4 second rule just became second
habit, so while tecnically based on that rule should only leave 2 seconds
for a VW bus I still stay pretty close to the 4 seconds....having many
years ago hit someone in the rear (very minor damage) that helpless
feeling &quot;KNOWING&quot; you are going to hit and not being able to do a dang
thing about it is to say the least Sobering!
