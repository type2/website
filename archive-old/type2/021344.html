Subject: Air Cond Compressor

When I went to tighten the belt on my (York) compressor ('79, APC) and
loosened the bolts that hold the plate down, it was terribly obvious
that 2 of the bolts had pierced the compressor.  Lost a bit of freon and
mebbe 2 tablespoons of oil...

It seems all sealed up with the bolts back snug.  I'm guessing it has
been this way from the beginning, as I seem to remember that the air was
on the invoice...

Is this something I need to fix or just go with it?  Any way to fix it
by patching the compressor?  JB Weld?

Teri
