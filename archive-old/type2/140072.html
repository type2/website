Subject: Re: [T2] Cooling fan issues

Andy,

It not that bad of a sound. My father swears he can not hear it.  It only 
happens at idle.  I did temporarily disconnected the belt and ran it engine. The 
sound disappeared.

I was afraid you were going to say pull the engine.  If it were summer I 
would not hestitate, it 32 degrees today.  And I do not have access to a garage.

Thanks.
is it a really bad sound?
the fan may be cracked around the hub.
I would pull the engine and have a look.
