Subject: RE: [T2] Steering box question

TRW makes the replacement steering box for late bays. It does not fit
early bay's. I don't believe that early bay steering boxes are
availalble new, only rebuilt. Late bay boxes supposedly cannot be
rebuilt.

Be careful as TRW boxes are not all the same. The box available from
Bus Boys seems to be an older casting with better machining.  The
other TRW box is difficult to get a proper adjustment. I tried both of
them and went with Bus Boys.
