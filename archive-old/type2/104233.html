Subject: Re: [T2] Engine rebuild help?

&gt; Well you have to ask yourself why the seals &quot;blew&quot;.  It might be because you have excessive blowby from worn rings.  I'd start with a compression test and leakdown test.  Replacing all of those seals is a lot of work that will be wasted if they just blow out again in a few days.

Id also keep in mind the &quot;Steven Dolan Blowby Postulate&quot;

Excessive blowby in T2 engines can be caused by worn valve guides.
