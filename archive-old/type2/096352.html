&gt; So, do you drive your bus every day? I do. Its a camper, which I guess is 

yup, my 78 is my daily driver, and only vehicle, so it has got to run.

&gt; odd to drive every day, but living in a place like San Francisco, I can't 

and I'm at the other end of the USofA

&gt; I ask because of some bad experience with a local repair shop in Daly City 
&gt; called Tassi. I called a few days ago, told them the specific job I needed 
&gt; to have done, which should have given them a slight clue as to the amount of 
&gt; time needed to do it, and they said they could do it on saturday.

they could do it on saturday, they just didn't.

&gt; What? They waited on everyone that drive into the shop and waited for their 
&gt; cards today, pushing my job back? Why in the (*&amp;) did I drop mine off last 

yup, they were standing right there glaring at em, couldn't get away with
working on yours.

&gt; me, just deal with it cuz they are my only option attitude?

no, this is pretty much the normal way with most car repair places, just
about all the repair places do this.

&gt; everythings fine, it will work out, but some people need to just come 
&gt; through even 10 damned % of the time on what they say, or not bother even 
&gt; trying. slow results I could deal with, but complete and total lack of 
&gt; ANYTHING being addressed at all, when I was given the impression it would be 
&gt; DONE today, just frosts my grandmothers arse.

about the only one you can count on is yourself and some of the busma you
will find on this list (or side of the road bus pilots)

&gt; Time to call Freds in Redwood city to see if they can get me in instead, 
&gt; even if it is another 20 minutes out of the way.

what makes you think they will treat you any better???

get the Bentley and some basic tools you can't do any worse than they will
and at least you give a d*mn. about your ride.
