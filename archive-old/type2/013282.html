Give it to Shelby. 
I some times have to hit four or five bars before I corner someone to
listen to me talk about Volksawgens. Even then I have to buy the house a
round.

Once upon a time I got into a bar-room discussion about oil.
I was bragging about one of my cars having a lot of miles on and never
having to have a rebuild.
I said that engines were designed with big journals on the mains and rods
to run with 10.5 compression ratio and leaded gas, and that with unleaded
gas and lower compression the engines just lasted longer now.
He contested that saying that the engine oils have been greatly improved
over the past twenty years and that is why engines last longer.
I held my position and was becomming frustrated at his persistance, he
wouldnt give and inch and neither was I.
Finally!
Well after four beers I agreed with him.

Send the beers to Stan Wilder, 3934 Clover Lane, Dallas Texas


tom,
i was simply making the entire list aware of the
problem i had with my engine a couple weeks ago, and
now giving the list the answer AVP has given back.  i
am merely asking the list what they think the
possibility of a piston coming apart and breaking a
valve is as opposed to the other way around.  i am in
no way asking for people to &quot;beat up&quot; AVP.
