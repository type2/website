Subject: Re: [T2] where to find pressure plate bolts?

Steve -

My experienced advice is to obtain the correct bolts from VW themselves,
they've been the only source I can trust on this style of clutch cover
bolt.  I don't know of any aftermarket vendor that carries the correct bolt
(except maybe Bus Depot).  Order 022 141 197 C - (Bus Depot shows them for
$1.81 each).  Note the photo - these have a special head for the 215mm
flywheel and you should not trust your clutch to inferior grade strength
bolts or improper hex heads.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; As some wise folks on the list advised me the flywheel that came with my
&gt; 1976 engine was too big to make a proper fit with the rest of my 1974 bus.
&gt; The engine used a 228mm flywheel and my bell housing wanted a 215mm.  I
&gt; got
&gt; it the correct flywheel + pressure plate it wanted and a new clutch plate,
&gt; had the flywheel ground down real nice and I think I'm ready to go.  Now
&gt; the
&gt; 228's 8mm pressure plate bolts are too big for the 215mm flywheel and this
&gt; is where my question comes in:
&gt; I understand that the 215mm uses  6 hex head 7mm bolts but I'm not sure
&gt; where to get any that will be strong enough.  I'm assuming I need grade 8
&gt; steel but my local hardware store only has grade 5.  Any ideas?
&gt; also... is there only one size throwout baring for these pressure plates
&gt; from 72-79?
&gt; Thanks a bunch,
&gt; Steve in S. Jersey
