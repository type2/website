Hey there Volks,

Hemming Motor News has a online price guide. It's limited to kombi's
and transporters (no campers and deluxes), but will give you a
&quot;ball-park&quot; figure.

They want you to buy the price guide if you need more details. Check
your local magazine news-stands too, as there are some decent
collector car price guides out there for under $10.

HTH, YMMV, etc. etc.
