Subject: Fitting a 34PICT3 on a 1600DP With alternator

I've done this recently. Don't grind or bend anything.  Loosen off the nut 
on the throttle shaft, take the little hair pin clip off of the rod, if I 
remember correctly. The offending accel pump linkage part pulls off. Then, 
you flip it over. Thus, the offending part is at the top instead of the 
bottom. Only problem is the adjusting screw is now on the back, where you 
can't adjust it. So what, you never adjust those anyway. It now clears the 
alternator no problemo.
I got a linkage from an alternator Beetle, it's in my garage. I compared the 
parts, the only difference is the parts are mirror image. It works fine to 
flip it.

&lt;together and went to install the 34PICT3 Carb but the throttle linkage
to the accellarator pump is hitting on the side of my alternator.

This is frustrating, as its taken me a while to get to here and now
that I'm so close I'm stuck.&gt;
