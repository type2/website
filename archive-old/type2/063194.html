&gt;OK, I've heard about the pros and cons of putting a 009 distributor into

&gt;I've observed that the &quot;dog gear&quot; at the bottom of the 009 distributor has a 
&gt;different orientation relative to the rotor compared to my 005: and it's 
&gt;not off by a convenient 90 degrees either. 

I believe you need to change the distributer drive gear (in the engine). Why
are you switching to the 009? It won't have enough of an advance curve. I
just changed my 1.8l from an 009 back to a distributer with vacuum advance.
Runs much better.
