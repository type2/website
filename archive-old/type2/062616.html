Subject: couldn't fix a '66 T2...
Left work about 6.15, saw somebody with an old green split by the side of 
the road heading the other way, made a U turn, tried to help, he said it had 
died all at once... poked around, noticed his belt was loose, points looked 
passable and more or less at 016, didn't have a condensor to fit that 
distributor... would a dead coil have stranded him? It was frustrating not 
being able to do more than give him a lift to where he wanted to get to...
