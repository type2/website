Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Dual battery Relay


&gt;I think the best way to go here would actually be to leave wiring as it is,
&gt;with all of the consumers connected to the main battery, leave the relay in
&gt;as I have it installed, and install a manual marine switch (like the one I
&gt;had in there when I bought the bus) to switch back and forth between
&gt;batteries, so that when camping I can use the aux battery, when driving I
&gt;can use the main battery and still charge the aux. battery.


Why couldn't you use a DPDT relay for every item you want to be switchable 
from both batteries, depending on whether the ignition is on or not, and use 
the key-on as the trigger wire?
