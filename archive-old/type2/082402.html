&gt; &gt; An '81 westy doesn't have belts in the back seat?  Did they=20
&gt; designate it
&gt; &gt; &quot;stationary use only&quot;?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; An '81 Westy originally had seat belts in the back seat.  So=20
&gt; does my '79.
&gt; True they are only lap belts but better than nothing.

Lap belts are easier to work with when installing a child safety
seat.  Funny, this guy's selling his for the exact same reason that
I bought my wife her 79, to ferry kids around.  I was a strictly type 1
person until the need presented itself (the wife refuses to drive
a mini-van or SUV, something about being called a soccer-mom ...) =20
