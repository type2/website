Subject: RE: [T2] compression variability

That does seem odd. Did you redo the compression test
to double-check your intial results? I assume you
adjusted the valves first if they're mechanical?  look
at the valve stem heights, make sure one hasn't
pounded it's seat out.

With a new block, I would assume that your are more
likely to have a problem with a head or valve sealing
as opposed to a ring problem. Assuming the rebuild was
done right.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
Hello.  A recent compression check on a 2000cc FI
rebuilt 15k or so ago led to the following results:

1 - 145
2 - 160
3 - 150
4 - 95 

Any thoughts about this variability?

Thanks,
Greg ('78 hibernating Westy)
