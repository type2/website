Subject: PUYALLUP, Oct 18th, VW meet.

All,
   The VW event at the puyallup, Fairgrounds on the 18th
has a camp area. The contact at the fairground said to
&quot;pick a spot in the lot by the big white rollar coaster&quot;.
She also said that it is on &quot;5th street&quot;.
   You can come in on Saturday and they will go around and
collect a $10.00 fee for the spot.
   An additional contact would be&lt;Bill / 206-789-9531&gt;.
  Has anyone overnighted here? Any Info would be great
and I will pass it along. Here is the fairground's homepage,
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;http://www.thefair_dot_com/&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are maps of the
fairgrounds,,etc,etc.
               Thanks,

                    Daniel Axel Simmons
