Subject: what market? (long)

Hello group, I'm new to the list and have just bought a '74 single cab
which appears to be in completely original condition.  In the past I've
owned a 73 bus and a  74 bus and this truck is a little different from both
of them, so I'm wondering what market it was originally intended for.

The truck has no front parking lights.  The front turn signals are, like
the bus, just below the windshield but are single filament bulbs with only
single contacts in the bulb receptacle.
Also, the truck has no back-up lights.  It has the long amber, red and
white lenses but at the bottom where the reverse lights should be, there
are just empty sockets, with NO electrical wires going to it and no
electrical contact in the sockets.  The rear turn signals and brake lights
are just like the 73 and 74 bus I had.

The truck has a type IV engine but has no seatbelts.  This appears to be
this way from the factory.  All the plastic screws are in place where
seatbelts would mount but this truck has no belts!

My question is:  lacking all of the above, it appears that this truck was
not destined originally for the north american market as it would not meet
some of the US safety requirements.  Does anyone know what market this
truck was originally intended for, given the above information?  Many
thanks!  Greg
