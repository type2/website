Subject: Re: [T2] microbus news

Ron's right...this Westfalia is pretty expensive. We looked at one  
last year, and while I have to say I really, really liked it for the  
size and accommodations, it was pricey.

It had a lot of plusses for us, including the fact that it is not an  
enormous beast. But as a daily driver, it would be a bit much. Our VW  
is much more practical.

If someone gave me one, I'd say thanks, but I can't image spending  
that much money on a camper...

&gt; Yes, and no.  Westfalia is still in business, but is now majority-

&gt; Daimler/Chrysler. As a result they are now doing the &quot;factory&quot; camper
&gt; conversions for Mercedes vans (sold in the U.S. as Dodge/Freightliner
&gt; Sprinters).  One of those conversions is sold in the U.S. under the
&gt; Airstream name (see http://www.52weekends_dot_com/). It is a hightop

&gt; expensive.
