Importance: Normal

Yesterday, I pulled the motor out of the '76 to replace the front seal and
when I put it back in it started right up ('cept it wouldn't stay running
cause a missed hose on the FI.. Oops, taken care of). The *only* thing that
is odd after this is that the blinker, when signalling right, AND stepping
on the brakes, blinks twice as fast. Step off of the brakes, blinks normal
speed. Signalling left is normal. Now what in the world could I have done
that would make it do this?

Not a problem, just annoying.

Thanks!
