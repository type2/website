????? why wouldn't it absorb water from the air in the brake fluid
resevoir??? there is probably as much are there as in a tightly sealed
brake fluid bottle??? and it has breather opening??

don't leave fluid out in a bowl but in a tightly stopperd container.
doesn't have any warning on the label??
