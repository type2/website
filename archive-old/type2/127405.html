Subject: Attention 73 Westy Owners

Others hit delete if you're tired of Westy questions! :)
 
I'm having trouble determining what type of &quot;hold-downs&quot; are used for the folding bed bottom seat cushion and the jumpseat cushion.  My 73 has a screwed down &quot;peg&quot; on the outside cabinet face and 2 holes on the cushion underside where some type of hold-down or clamp was- and would latch to this &quot;peg&quot; I guess.
I got some hold-downs from a 71 that are different so I'm thinking Westy used something different in 73.
This is my last Westy part dilemna so help and PICTURES from fellow 73 owners is very much appreciated!
 
Thanks,  Chris
