Subject: Re: [T2] WHEE!!! 55mph!

&gt;or loose lug-nuts.  BTDT, had a couple of close calls.

Lost a front wheel on a parts Beetle, and was checking a Volvo for a friend 
which made similar noises. Said &quot;you know? Sounds like loo- - - -&quot;

And the wheel came off. Luckily it did no damage to the car, ruined the 
lugnut holes and the studs themselves. $20 repair.

A front wheel on a bus could be bad - - - very bad...
