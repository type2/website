  Don't know about video's but the following books are about
restoration/rebuilding:

  All About VW Performance Engines II  -  Can be ordered from HotVW's
magazine for $6.00.  Good book and it is not just on 'performance
engines'.  Has a very good article on stock 1600 cc engine building.

  How to Rebuild you Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine - Can be obtained at
most book stores such as Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders, etc etc.  Seems to be
one of the 'bibles' on rebuilding VW air cooled engines.  Excellent Book. 
Sells for about $15.00. 

  Haynes Guide to Purchase &amp; DIY Restoration VW Beetle &amp; Transporter -
Again, can be obtained at most book stores.  Pretty good, but browse it
before you buy it. 

  VW Bus Custom Handbook by Laurence Meredith - Obtained at most book
stores.  Has a good section in the last half of the book on 'restoration'. 
A $16.00 book. 

  How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive by John Muir - Must reading material,
especially for the beginner and the DIY'er.  About $25.00

  The Officeal Volkswagen Service Manual by Robert Bentley - This book can
be ordered from several suppliers.  Bus Depot or one of the many
advertisers who advertise in HotVW's or VW Trends magazine.  It is about
$35 - $40 but seems to be the best and the final word on VW's. When in
doubt, look it up in your Bently's manual. 

  Hope this information helps you.  Get greasy and have fun doing it.
