I was just explaining how I resurrect a sitting bus.

&gt; The hot start relay is exactly what I tried but the relay chatters. All
&gt; automotive ones I could find did. By chatter I mean that it turns on and
&gt; off really quickly. The relay itself was rated at 40A

Does the relay do this if you energize the relay using 12v coming from the
battery? Sounds like the wire from the ignition switch to terminal 50 is
screwy.
