&gt; I bought a tester and I'm going to test the compression this weekend.
What
&gt; I know:
&gt;
&gt; - warm up engine first
&gt; - remove all plugs
&gt; - test one by one with throttle wide open each time
&gt;
&gt; What I don't know is the best way to stop the fuel from flowing while I
&gt; perform the test.

I never worry about the fuel flow - even with FI, there just isn't enough to
bother with.  I just unplug the wire that supplies power to the positive
side of the coil (the terminal that does NOT go to the condensor) and wrap
it in a shop rag so it can't touch anything.  That way there's no spark to
the plugs so no danger.  If you're really concerned you could pull all 4
injector connecters as well.  But no matter what, make SURE you can't get a
spark!!

Many many years ago I had a 1981 Datsun 200 SX.  Interesting thing about the
motor was it had EIGHT spark plugs for only four cylinders.  In my
inexperience, I bought a non-threaded compression tester (just a rubber end
that you stick in place and hold with your hand).  I removed 1 spark plug,
stuck the tester in there, and had someone turn over the engine while I
eagerly awaited the resulting needle movement on the tester.  When the
engine was turned over, fuel was injected into the cylinder, the OTHER spark
plug in that cylinder ignited it, and the tester shot out of my hand, missed
my head by an inch, and shattered my neighbor's window 40 feet away when it
finally landed.  One of my luckier days I guess :)

Oh, BTW, it's a good ideas to loosen all 4 plugs (still snug, just not
tight) before warming up the engine.  Less chance of damaging the delicate
threads in the heads that way.
