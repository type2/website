 The wiring to my rear lights isn't so hot.  Lots of old connectors and
 brittle wire going to rotting tail light housings full of rust, muck and
 such. 
  
 &gt;The battery plate/ledge is 90%  gone, the remaining parts look like paper 
thin &gt;Swiss cheese. You can look into the  engine compartment from the side 
of the bus.

See if you can get some Wood and fit it in there over the swiss chess parts. 
Try and plug the hole so you can see in there anymore. 

&gt;I've had NO luck with connectors.  The wire slips out, the pinch  connectors 
break &gt;off, the plastic sleeve always falls off the connection  when you 
crimp.
&gt;Any thoughts?


I'd extend the necessary wires to the other side if possible. Get the yellow 
handles crimpers and a kit from flaps and use the blue female connectors and 
use the blue dot on the crimpers. crimp it once. get the different sizes of 
wire and corresponding size connectors and electrical tape and the wiring 
diagram. it should work.

&gt; How much rust is too much rust?

That depends how far you need to go. you should probably find a welder if you 
can see into the engine compartment, but moving the battery will keep you 
going.
