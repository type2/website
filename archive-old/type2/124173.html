X-RFC2646: Format=Flowed; Original
Subject: Re: [T2] VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

&gt; Dave's right. Volks like us are just collateral damage.

But you know what? I followed the original link to the LA Times story that 
Richard put up, and the state is making some ridiculous claims for the 
tonnage of smog created by classic cars. Some millions of tons of pollutants 
by a few thousand cars. I can't belive how stupid they think people are to 
believe those numbers, and how dishonest they are to create and propagate 
those numbers. This statement particularly burnt me up:

&quot;Although many people are concerned about the pollution released by sport
utility vehicles, a single vintage Volkswagen bug puts out more pollutants
than a huge fleet of SUVs.&quot;

So I wrote a letter back saying:

&quot;I use the Gunson Gastester to keep my smog-exempt vintage VW fleet tuned,
and I am able to obtain numbers equal to what my late model smog-tested
vehicles are required to have.&quot;

Specifically, I recall my last smogged vehicle was required to have 1.5% 
maximum CO. I am often able to get my VW's under 1%, and other times I'm in 
the 1.5%, and rarely do I have to accept 2 to 2.5.
