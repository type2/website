Subject: Administrivia - Information needed

Volks,

This evening I received a most disturbing piece of e-mail.  Before I
discuss it on the list or take any action, I would like to solicit
information or complaints from any list member who has had dealings with
Frank Leach doing business as Christys Vintage Cars.  Please mail me
directly.  Please do not mail the list.

                           H Steven Dolan
			   Co-administrator, type2 list

Today's guru was yesterday's
&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
