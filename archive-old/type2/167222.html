Subject: Thoughts on locking engine compartment

My 2 cents: When I bought our T2, the VERY FIRST THING I did was get a 
locking bonnet latch - I even had the locksmith here do it. (KEN'S Locksmith 
in H.B. - _at_ $40 bucks total) Here's why:

When I had a bug, I also caught 2 grown men checking out my bug's innards!! 
CREEPY.

More importantly - it's a safety issue (I'm a GIRL!)

There were a few times when someone would open up the bug's bonnet while I 
was in classes, and just disconnect the distributor wire. No start. Most 
other 'helpless females' wouldn't see the problem, slap it right back on, 
start up and go. This happened a few times, and a few weeks after the last 
time it happened, one of my classmates who drove a vw also - same issue - 
was approached by some nice guy who just happened to be there to help her 
out, knew all about these types of cars, etc. - she was kidnapped, and 
...etc.

To halt a fire, I'll make sure the extinguisher is handy, and I'll install 
the fuel cut-off (GREAT IDEA!!)when I replace the lines this summer, but the 
lock stays on.
