&gt;Ok, I guess I'll make doubly-sure it's the tank outlet that's clogged

&gt;return line back to the can.

I probably wouldn't run a return line either but keep your testing time to a minimum: the pump is very strong and you'll drain your gas can and fill up the tank faster than you realize (perhaps at a rate of a gal every 4 minutes).

&gt;7.5mm ID from tank to filter?

7mm (multiply by 1.071428571428571 if you live in Fresno ;-)

&gt;Anyway, if that causes the pump noise to go away, I guess I get to pull 
&gt;the engine again (oh the irony; the tank came out to replace the sender 
&gt;when I had my rebuilt engine installed ... why wouldn't the tank have 
&gt;plugged up way back then?)

Experience teaches the VW owner to replace everything possible on a 25 yr old vehicle at every engine removal opportunity. Unfortunately you'd spend no time enjoying your bus and all of it reading type2_dot_com archives to be the wiser.

Bird beak is my guess also. Give me a call if you need any assistance.
