&gt; No, the fuel filler neck in a '72-'79 bus is accessed through the round hatch

&gt; not such a hard job.

its' a  lot easier with the computer out, and that is a real easy job.  
1. as in all jobs, disconect the battery
2. unplug the wiring harness from the computer.
3. take out the two small bolts at the top and bottom of the computer
4. slide computer out. (well not really a full blown computer)

installation is the reverse
