Subject: Confused by Gauges

All this talk of the gauges is very confusing...
I don't really think I need one for RPMs, I think I have it down pretty well just to listen to my baby and it tells me when to shift.
I would like something to help me out with the temp. though.  I don't know what kind of temp. gauge I should use, dip stick or whatever.  I would rather have an actual needle instead of just a warning light, but what's the most important part to measure?  The oil or heads?  I just want to be able to watch my bus's temp. when I'm driving in the mountains and make sure we aren't going to over heat it.

I've been trying to follow all the emails about gauges but I'm really just baffled by all of it.
