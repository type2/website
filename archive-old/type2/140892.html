Subject: RE: [T2] Source for front turn signal lights, '73-79?

&gt; The part I am looking to replace is the LIGHT FIXTURE.
&gt; This is the electrical part that the light bulbs plug
&gt; into.  It holds the front parking light and the turn
&gt; signal light.  One light fixture on each side, in the
&gt; front, below the windshield wipers.
&gt; Where can I buy these?  Brasil? Mexico? Junkyard?


We have obtained these in the past from Brazil. Unfortunately they are
currently on backorder. Hopefully this really is a backorder and they are
not going obsolete. (It's not always easy to tell with parts coming out of
Brazil.) If so, we'll probably see them again in January.
