Subject: STOCK DUAL CARBS TO PORSCHE 1700 L-JET FI CONVERSION QUESTIONS???

Hello list,

I was thinking about my soon to be rebuild and was
wondering what would be the best rout, stock dual
carbs or Porsche L-Jet FI. I like the idea of the fuel
injection. My bus is a 74 standard bus with an
automatic 73 1700cc engine. I have the chance to
acquire a complete Porsche 1.7 L-Jet FI system. In
short, what else would I need to convert from the
stock dual carbs to this FI system? I know that I
would need to have an electric fuel pump with
regulator. Will the stock wiring system on my bus be
suficient to run this FI system? Will the stock vacuum
advance dizzy work with this FI? other than the
complete FI system cost, what kind of cost am I
looking at in other parts needed? I have an electric
fuel pump from a F_at_RD Pick up. Can I just use a
regulator with this fuel pump? All in all, what else
do I need? I looked in the archives and it answered
some questions and raised even more. Any help would be
appreciated. Thanks!

David Kelly
