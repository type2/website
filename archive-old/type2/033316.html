&gt;You think that's bad?! The brochure says that an additional small child
&gt;can sleep on a mat under the end of the main bed in the back! Call DCS
&gt;[Department of Child Services]!!! LOL

I can confirm that children up to ~7 yrs can sleep there and they love it,
it feels cavelike and safe to them. Although it is best not to stomp on
them accidentally if you get up to check on the outhouse. Toddlers can also
sleep happily in the walkthrough if you build it up with some &quot;egg crate&quot;
foam so it's more flat. So, if you have the child's cot as well, you can
sleep three youngins and two adults all on the first floor, and not packed
too much tighter than a slave ship. =^ )
