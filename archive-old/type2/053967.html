Subject: Re: L-Jetronic Tuning Question

I thought I still had the box my K&amp;N came in, but no such luck. Any FLAPS 
that carries K&amp;N will be able to look it up and order it for you. But be 
forwarned: They ain't cheap. About 70bucks if I recall correctly. And the 
filter doesn't really alter the mixture enough to worry about. The stock AFM 
runs out of ability to flow at about 3500rpm. Just look at the tiny space the 
flapper occupies. The best, and probably most cost effective way to move more 
air thru a built 2.0L is to switch over to a C.I.S. Bosch injection system. 
There is just not enough to work with on the L-jet.
