&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Does this problem sound familiar to anyone: When I start my 78 FI bus,
&gt;&gt;it runs at higher RPM just for a few seconds, then starts to settle
&gt;&gt;down to idle (normal so far).  However, the RPMs just keep dropping
&gt;&gt;until the bus almost stalls.  It will usually catch &quot;just before the
&gt;&gt;last revolution&quot; and come back up to a normal idle, but sometimes it
&gt;&gt;does stall
&gt; 
&gt;What I think is happening: Van starts with Cold Start valve adding extra
&gt;fuel to go with the extra air caused by the leak. Van starts, and runs fast 
&gt;with extra air, and gas. When cold start valve shuts down, now extra air

        This is a common misconception about the cold start valve.

        Note its name:  cold *start* valve.  Two things must be true for
it to be operating:

        1)  it's gotta be cold
        2)  the starter must be cranking(!)

        It is grounded via a temperature-controlled switched, but it gets
its +12V from the starter.  As soon as the starter quits spinning, the
cold start valve slams shut.

        A vacuum leak may very well be a part of the problem, but the cold
start valve shouldn't (can't!) be part of the problem in this way.  It
would typically fail by either being leaky (always rich) or having an open
circuit (never engages).

        There are two other parts of the L-Jet system that are involved
with cold conditions.  One is the auxilliary air regulator that (effectively**)
holds the throttle open for you when the engine is cold.  This is analagous
to the fast-idle cam on Solex carbs.  The other subsystem is the pair of
temperature sensors.  When the engine &amp;/or the intake air are/is cold,
the brain will choose have the injectors deliver more gas.  This is the
choking function.  In principle, if your engine were always warm, you could
remove the auxilliary air reg. &amp; plug the hole, remove the temp sensors
&amp; ground their leads (tells the brain that the engine's hot), and remove
the cold start valve &amp; plug its hole.

        I don't know the precise cause of the original poster's problem, but
the transition in behavior during warmup is most likely due to either the
aux. air. reg. or the temp. sensors.  Not to say that the problems lie with
these subsystems... they might just be exacerbating some other problem.

        Good luck!

(**The aux. air. reg. actually lets air into then intake manifold at a
place downstream of the throttle valve, thereby bypassing it.  It doesn't
actally hold the throttle open, but it's the same effect.)
