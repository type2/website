Subject: Re: so we got in the red vw microbus, and headed toward the
 police officer station!

&gt;I'm wondering if it is a problem everyone faces, or does it vary state, t=
&gt;o state?  If the bus is mint, is it different?  Answers, comments, and st=
&gt;ories appreciated!!  :) =20

in july 1991 i headed from san francisco to cabo san lucas ten days before
the solar eclipse. no problem until i hit ti juana. frigadere generale
frito aholay pulled the unblemished 72 deluxe over, asked for my driver's
license, and said follow me to the station. (i realized later that was
bribe time.) he started mumbling in broken english about how us norte
amercanos use mommy and daddy money to come south of the border and rip up
mexico as if it were a giant sandbox. with that and a few other things, i
told him i wasn't going anywhere with him and i wanted my license back now
in spite of whatever he thought i might have done or said. i dunno, my
co-pilot still states to this day i broke a law; i doubt it.  - steve
