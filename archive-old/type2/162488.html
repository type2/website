&gt; Bob,

&gt; Wasn't there someone who finally figured out that one of their hoses from
&gt; the tank to the fuel pump was collapsing on them?
&gt;
&gt; 1.  How about not just &quot;checked&quot; but &quot;replaced&quot;.

I have metal hoses, flexible mesh stainless steel hoses from tank to pump
and most other places. they will fail not collapse

&gt; 2.  Something floating around in the tank that covers up the intake.

??hmmm??

&gt; 3.  Tank vent hole plugged or covered?

 ?? hmmm hadnt thought of that

&gt; 3.  Grounds all inspected/replaced?  Look at the wires where they are
&gt; 	crimped on.

checked good and tight, also wiggled while running.

&gt; 4.  Possibly the pertronix, although most folks insist that they
&gt; 	don't go bad, just die.

digging around in the garage for that .009 I know I have in there
somewhere

&gt; 5.  Wires to the fuel pump checked for tightness?

checked

&gt; 6.  Pertonix wires where they come out of the distributor not rubbing raw?

checked

&gt; 7.  Bad ignition switch intermittent connection?

doesn't fully cut out just loses 2/3 of it's power or so never 100%
&gt;
&gt; Q.  Better or worse in the heat/cold?

nope

&gt; Q.  Better or worse over smooth or bumpy roads?

no difference.  have wiggled every wire and hose and plug I know of while
running, no change

&gt; Q.  When this happens, and you take it out of gear, does it die or idle?

it',s an automatic so that is a little harder. but will give it a try.

thanks

Bob
