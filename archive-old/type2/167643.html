Subject: Re: [T2] wiring harness refurb??? 

guess the subject line says it all.

does anyone refurbish 78 FI engine wiring harness.

I have two junkyard harnesses, neither functional, but between the two
every thing is there.  I was going to try to make one good harness from
the two but if there is someone doing that already...(and who probably has
already made the mistakes)


thanks
Bob
