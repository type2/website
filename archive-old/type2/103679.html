Subject: Brake Booster Hose

This hose is available through the VW Dealer. It costs about $10 per foot.
It costs about $80 to do one bus. Also buy the 'one-way air check' from them
while you're at it. The only viable cheaper alternative that I'm aware of is
the high strength oil pressure hose from The Bus Boys, which I've got
installed on my 72 bus. They specify on your receipt that they're not liable
if that hose fails while your driving, and its not intended for the purpose
you're using it. if you can live with that it's a bit cheaper. I currently
have 10k on the the less expensive Bus Boys hose with no collapsing evident.
