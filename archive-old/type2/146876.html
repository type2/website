Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for urrent CA smog check parameters

Hey Richard,
I looked at that PDF that you posted and I'm not sure I completely 
understand it.

Here's the thing.  I had my previous smog sheet and it had all the mins 
and maxes and I can't find the stupid peice of paper anywhere!  Do you 
happen to have your's handy?  If so, I'd *really* appreciate it if you 
could post the mins and maxes from that sheet.

In the mean-time, I am despirately trying to find my test results sheet. 
  You mentioned that you were going to scan your report and post it. 
Did you ever get a chance?

thanks,
Mike

&gt;&gt;Specifically I'm looking for what speed ranges they're currently testing 
&gt;&gt;at and what the min/max values are for the tested gases.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They simlulate acceleration on the dyno, test at 15 mph and again at 25mph. Here' my experience with test results:
