Subject: Rocker panel welding (how to guide)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi Volks,

Some time ago I asked the list help on welding in a new rocker panel. I did
not get much response to my particular questions. However I did get a lot of
messages from people with the same problem. They asked me to forward any
helpful information.

So I bit the bullet and went ahead on my own. The result was quite
encouraging. To help all of you with the same questions I have prepared an
extensive description of what I did (with lots of pictures).

You can see it at  http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus.htm and then click on the
button &quot;Rocker Welding&quot;

If there are any remaining questions or things that are unclear please let
me know so I can amend the text.
