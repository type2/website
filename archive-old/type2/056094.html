Subject: 1969 Westfalia For Sale, Dallas Texas

I have decided to sell &quot;We Made It!&quot;, the
blue '69 Westy poptop.

Good:  

It works.  It's my daily transportation.  It has a new
1600DP from from Scat with 3000 miles on it, a new
Solex 34, a new muffler, and a new battery.
I put in a new poptop last summer, along with a canvas
cot, it's beautiful.  The front end was rebuilt last
year by a German mechanic with German ball joints and
tie rods.   Four good tires.   
This bus went no slower than 50mph from Albuquerque to 
Santa Fe last week.  It regularly goes 70 taking me on
my 30 mile (each way) commute to work. 

Bad: 

Rust.  This bus has all the rust you would expect to find.
The nose was squished by the PO, and he tried to fix it
with large amounts of bondo.  There are rust holes around 
the windshield, but no water leaks.  The floor boards have
that rusted seam at the front of the wheel well.  I 
ground off the rust, painted it, and glued it together with
bondo.  That keeps the water out for now.  Rusty rockers.
Rusty under the battery tray.
This is all fixable, I'm sure.

Considering that I have about $1600.00 in the engine 
compartment this year alone, $250.00 in the poptop
from last year, and $600.00 in the front end...  I 
want to sell this bus for $2000.000.  I'll throw in 
the 1600 SP motor, two extra doors (front driver and
passenger), a SP intake, and 2 nearly new Solex 30's.

Located near Dallas Texas.
