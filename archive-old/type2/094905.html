Subject: Emergency Flasher Installation

Hi Folks,

I've been lurking on the list for a while, and now have a new question:  How 
do I go about hooking up a switch and relay for emergency flashers?  My 79 
Westy came from the PO with no flasher switch and an aftermarket turn signal 
relay.  I'm moving to North Carolina in the fall, and will need flashers in 
order to pass safety inspection.

First, I checked under the dash, and can find no obvious exposed wires or 
exposed contacts on the relay.  I've also checked Bentley, but can't make 
heads or tails of the wiring diagram.  I also checked the T2 Archives, but 
found no useful information regarding rewiring or installing flashers.  I 
ordered a flasher switch, and was worried about the 9 or so contacts on top 
of it -- would I have to run new wires to all of those, or are some contacts 
&quot;extra&quot; for other electrical items?

Thanks for any help or suggestions.
