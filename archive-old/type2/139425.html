Those look slick, but put them in the same category as space-saver 
spare tires: 30 mph for no more than 30 miles.

Good. It's a drag. But you're embarking on a deeply serious trip. 
Two-fifths of the way across the continent! Over the Great Divide! This 
is big, Don. Give what you're doing the respect it deserves. Lots of 
people with buses today never venture more than a hundred miles from 
home.
