Cat litter.  Unused of course.
Seriously, go to a feed store and get some absorbent material usually 
used for cat litter.  It's a naturally occurring mineral that readily 
absorbs oils and other liquids.  About $5 for 50 lbs, cheap.  You may 
have to use one of those SImple Green/Citrosolv/etc stuff afterwards 
to get the oils buried deep in the concrete, depending on the surface 
finish of the concrete.

&gt; What should I use to clean up the garage floor (cement). I have dripped
&gt; a lot of oil on it and we cleaned out the transmission bell housing
&gt; onto the floor too. :p I forgot to put down some newspapers...
&gt; Preferably there is something environmentally friendly that I can use.
&gt; Any ideas?
