Subject: WTB EU/UK 40PDSIT carbs from 914

Hi Gang...

Title says it....

I'm looking for anyone who has or knows of any dual 40PDSIT carbs
offered on a 914 (according to Hanes) 2.0 in the UK or Europe where FI
wasn't as popular...if they're not for sale, that's OK...I want to know
if they even exist, and how they're jetted if possible.

Alternately...has anyone ever tried removing the venturi from a pair of
32-34 PDSIT carbs to see how they would work on a 2.0 flowing more
air...I know removing the primary venturi on water cooled for better
performance is popular with that crowd, but I've never heard of it among
the bus folk...inquiring minds need to know...don't we David..

I'm planning to build a somewhat strange type IV engine for my 79/75 bus
this winter...79 FI bus counter balanced crank and rods...low to mid
range cam...74 bus big valve heads...and dual carbs(hopefully
40PDSITs)...has anyone tried this on a dyno maybe, and could save me the
trouble? I'll likely do it anyways just to hear it hummmmm.

Any and all input welcome...provided it's positive...my flameproof suit
is out being repaired following my &quot;sharing your spare bus idea&quot;...was
that ever a test of my metal...zowie...

Happy holidays everyone.....Den
