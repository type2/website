Subject: Re: [T2] moody fuel injection

Kevin,

Sounds like you need to run some serious injector cleaner through
there...maybe even replace the injectors.  The only way I can think of 
that it ran with all 4 injectors unplugged was that they are leaking 
terribly....from garbage holding them open when they are supposed to be 
closed.

Think about it!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello,  My engine has been running rich and overall badly (speeding up and 
&gt; slowing down, almost dying and then coming back up).  Checked all vacuum lines.  
&gt; Next we checked the fuel system:
&gt; 
&gt; Turned the engine over, same ol' thing, fuel in the exhaust, etc.  So we 
&gt; unplugged one by one each fuel injection wire, and we found that nothing in the 
&gt; idle changed.  All fuel injecters were unplugged and it was still running.  Then 
&gt; we plugged them back in and it started to run much better cleaner and faster. 
&gt;  So the injecters must be getting voltage.  Weird.
