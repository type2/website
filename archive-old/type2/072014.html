Subject: looking for Jurgen

I sent a message to Jurgen ? (sorry, I don't have your last name handy) in
Yukon, Canada re heater parts and the note was bounced back stating no such
address.  This email address was taken from the listing of heater parts on
the type2 site.  Is Jurgen a list member?  I'd like to enquire about the
availability of some heater parts.  Thanks for your help.

--Todd Orchard
