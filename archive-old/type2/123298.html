Subject: Re: [T2] flywheel leak diagnosis

Richard,

I don't see much off here on anything except that your pressure
plate and flywheel look a little &quot;burned&quot;.  Easily fixed with some wet 
400+ grit sandpaper(in wet mode).

I also did *not* see oil on the clutch disk center parts at all.
Did you wipe anything off before you took pics?
Didn't &quot;see&quot; oil on the front side of the pressure plate either.


Flywheel seals are cheap...replace it and go on.  
Pressure plates/disks  are &quot;not&quot; cheap.  I didn't really see
that your disk was &quot;soaked&quot; with oil or anything....I'm wondering if the
pressure plate is just getting worn out?

You know how to test it?

So, have you got &quot;shipfitters disease&quot; or not?  You know..well, golly,
since I had to take this part off to get to that part, I'll just repaint
both of them...ahhh, but if I paint them, then I really should 
paint/replace this other one over here so they match...LOL!

Cheers, dave

&gt; The engine came out the previous Sat with Jason Thorpe's help, and this past
&gt; Sunday I removed the flywheel to examine my oil leak and slipping clutch. I
&gt; expect to see a lot worse but I couldn't tell where the leak was coming from
&gt; exactly.
&gt; 
&gt; Would a trained eye mind taking a look and helping with a diagnosis?
