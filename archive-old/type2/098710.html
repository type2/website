Subject: Windage tray for VW Type 4 engine

Dear David &amp; Type 2 listees.

Not only have I seen a VW Type 4 engine windage tray,
I have one for my 1911cc VW 17/1800 Type 2 &amp; 4
modified hybrid engine.

Mine originates from a 1971 VW 411LE fuel injected
engine, which is well illustrated in Tom Wilson's book
on &quot;How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Colled Engine&quot;,
published by HP Books.

Regards.

        Nigel A. Skeet
