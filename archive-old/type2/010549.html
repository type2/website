List ..

Happy Friday!  I would add another tire choice to Jan's list:  Bridgestone
603V, 185R-14, 8-ply, load range &quot;D&quot;.  They are available from www.tirerack_dot_com
for about $65 but I got mine locally and am very happy with them.

&gt; While all you Americans were still sound asleep I created a web-page on
&gt; tires and rims for our beloved buses. Have a look at

&gt; Feedback is appreciated!
