&gt; BTW, big stereos don't really need extra charging capacity.  They may
&gt; draw
&gt; big amperage from the battery for momentary loud sounds 
&gt; (Thump...Thump...Thump) but most of the time they only draw a few
&gt; amps.
&gt; 
&gt; The Kymco kits may be useful for situations where you _really_ need
&gt; the
&gt; extra power, but don't buy it just because the advertised numbers are
&gt; larger.

Thank you George! In the winter I used an almost useless electric
heater and had to turn it off prior to stopping at our destination in
order to recharge the battery! I'd rather not have to drive the bus at
all in the winter (salt) and don't know yet if I will have to again
this year. If I have to, I guess I will have to use the super
alternator because I froze all winter long and want to get a heater
with more btu's!! Can't use a gas heater or the stock heat for health
reasons. :-/

I didn't think about the stereo. I was thinking of installing my modern
car stereo in there in a hidden place that wouldn't require obvious
damage to the interior (glove box maybe?) but haven't gotten to that
point yet. More important thing right now is that my bus has no
consistant juice to run on! Not fun to go out to the bus and turn the
key and know that it is just a roll of the dice if it will be totally
dead or will start. Old voltage regulator might be sticking.

I have a question about this procedure too: It is a good idea to change
both the generator AND the voltage regulator at the same time if you
have to change one of them? (This is if we were to keep our current
generator for now.) A non-VW person insists that this is true but
haven't read this anywhere for VWs.

Thanks,
Jen :)
