 I have an independent insurance agent also- and never had any trouble 
insuring any VWs- he even was able to insure a Thing.  ( Although he took 
pics of that- in case )

   Wondering if anyone else was at Iola car show in Iola WI and saw the VWs 
in the car corral?  A guy had a double cab that looked great- til ya got up 
close and saw that they wedged in a 327 Chev motor.  They've got to ruin a 
perfectly good VW......
