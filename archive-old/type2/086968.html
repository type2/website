&gt; I have been having an intermitent problem with my fuel pump on my 79

had an almost identical problem, drove me nuts, turns out it was a broken
connector that looked good visually and tested ok unless moved exactly the
right way

&gt; I would hate to drop the $$ just
&gt; chasing an electric problem if it's not the pump. Does anyone (esp if
&gt; going to EB) have a known good pump I could borrow for a couple of
&gt; weeks to see if the problem goes away? If it is the pump I would
&gt; rather purchase a re-built or new one instead of having the trouble
&gt; rear it's head later.

well I have a spare that I have no problem lending you but I unfortunately
will not be able to make EB so if you can't get one down there get back to
me, not sure there is anyone I can easily hand it off to as they go. (I'm
in Baltimore)
