&gt; wow, someone on one of these lists must have a direct line to jb's! just got
&gt; a call from him and he promises to have it to me by late next week. whoever
&gt; made the call, thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; btw, he said my heater is the first nos heater of this type he has ever
&gt; seen. this is the type that mounts under the parcel tray, often called a
&gt; &quot;suicide heater&quot;. he also said he is selling his own repro of this type of
&gt; heater if anyone's interested. refer to my ealier post for my experience...
&gt; 
&gt; thanks again,

Tony:
I might be interested in a JB's repro suicide heater, but I'll wait til
I hear from you that he's got yours finished. I know how a ringing phone
can keep you from gettin the product out the door sometimes. I'll be
eagerly awaiting your (slightly late) report of JB's service.
