&gt;&gt;I hate to drive this thing into the ground, but I am
&gt;becoming a bit concerned. The VW number for my
&gt;distributer was wrong as I reported it. the correct
&gt;number is 311 905 205T. The number that apparently
&gt;doesn't exist: 0 231 167 014 is the correct number
&gt;that is stamped into the body of my distributer. I
&gt;tried to look it up myself and I agree: it doesn't
&gt;exist. Karl, I will email you a photo of this thing
&gt;that may help identify it as I do not know how to set
&gt;up a link for everyone. (This photo, showing the
&gt;numbers, will also hopefully prove that I am not
&gt;insain or dyslexic) If this is not the right
&gt;distributer for my bus, am I in danger of toasting my
&gt;valves or something? Also, what distributer (that is
&gt;compatible with my bus) do most recommend?
***************************
The 311 905 205T/0231 167 014 distributor fits Type 3 1600 with Dual Carbs
70-72, Manual Transmission, European market only.  Distributor probably
came with a &quot;turn key&quot; engine from Europe back in the 80's when it was the
rage to buy a &quot;good&quot; used complete engine from outfits like the now defunct
ECI.  Could have been from a privately imported vehicle too.  Some volks
were privately bringing in late model Notchbacks around then as well.

Takes a Dual Vacuum Advance/Retard Can, so it would appear it's timed at 5
degrees AFTER TDC, as most are, but don't take that as gospel.  A few were
timed at 0 TDC.  I don't have any other references on this distributor
other than the Factory Parts Book as to what it was originally installed on.

Go with the distributor Karl recommends, you'll be much happier.
