Subject: Victor Reinz??

Esteemed Bussers:

I just received an engine gasket kit for my '79 2.0 L from Bus Depot.  I
was told that I was going to get an Elring kit, but wound up getting a
Victor Reinz kit.  Does anyone have experience with Victor Reinz???  Is
this high quality stuff&gt;  Its made in Germany.  Does anyone know if pushrod
tube seals in this kit are viton?? Also, do front and rear crankshaft oil
seals typically come separately from the gasket kit?

Thanks,

Tim Woenker
