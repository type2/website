Subject: Re: FW: [T2] locks

You can really do this job yourself.  Use the key that fits the ignition.
You have to remove the door handles and then remove the lock cylinders.
IN the lock cylinders you will find a series of thin brass plates that
control the lock.  The key repositions the plates to unlock the door.  You
can change the order of the plates to match your ignition key.

Make sure that a key is in place before removing the lock cylinder.
Otherwise you may lose the little plates or springs.

Work carefully and keep track of all the parts.  Lube the cylinder with
white grease after you clean it.

&gt; So the '70 Westy that I got today turns out to have 3 different keys for it.
&gt; I can find new ignitions, and new door handles all day long, but does anyone
&gt; have suggestions for ordering them all matched?  I can't find them as a set.
