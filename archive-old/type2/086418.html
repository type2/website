I have the following ad on the samba:


Title........ Vanagon Eberspacher BA6
Price........ 350 OBO
Name......... Thomas Ainlay
EMail........ tainlay_at_sbcglobal_dot_net
Phone#....... 925 934-7342
Location..... Walnut Creek, California, USA
Web Site..... http://www.thingtech_dot_com/forsale.html
Description:
Eberspacher BA6 gas heater from a 1980 Vanagon.  This one is complete minus
the exhaust pipe.  The wire harness is complete and uncut.  All components
in excellent shape and includes all fasteners, mounting hardware, ductwork
and sheet metal covers (including the protective belly pan!).  This is
practically a bolt in installation for your aircooled Vanagon.  Could
probably be adapted to a watercooled Vanagon with some work.  Almost
everything needed for your Vanagon to keep you toasty warm during cold
weather - just install and add an exhaust pipe and you are set!

Please see:  http://www.thingtech_dot_com/forsale.html for more pictures.

Asking $350 OBO plus shipping
