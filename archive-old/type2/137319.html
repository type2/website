Subject: Re: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

Any FLAPS sells rebuild parts. If it doesn't then go somewhere else. They are a supermarket parts store - more for the guys who like to rub their vehicles with a diaper than fix them. 

NAPA has everything I suspect, Advance Auto has everything I think, Auto Zone, O'Reilly Auto too. 

Pay attention to the country of origin for the parts, I just won't use Chinese parts. American or European parts have been good to me. 

There just isn't a whole lot to a starter or alternator. The good shop manuals will explain the repairs and inspection points. If nothing else take an old starter apart, inspect, reassemble. Take it to a local rebuilder and let them rebuild it. Then take it apart to see what got replaced. This WILL void your warranty. Some rebuilders will let you watch. A car club with some older folks in it will have a few guys that can show you how to do this too. 

Starters for me have traditionally meant: new Bendix (drive), new bushings or bearings, new brushes, erridicate any rust on the shaft with crocus cloth, polish the commutator with some crocus cloth, wash it all down with some contact cleaner, new grease in the bushings, clean/inspect/replace the solenoid. new paint. There are some electrical tests in Muir's book and I think in the Bentley to do. None difficult as I recall.

Good basic explaination.
