First off, many thanks to the people who have already ordered shirts. However,
time is winding down, so if you're planning to order, please do it soon. I'm
turning the order in a week from today, which will be Friday the 21st. that
means you should probably mail them no later than next Tuesday. If I haven't
received your order by Friday, then I'm sorry, but it will be too late. I can't
really afford to order a bunch of extra shirts, so don't count on picking one
up later. The only exception to that will be a few extras that I plan to have
on hand for the Busses by Jordan Lake camp out on June 4-6.
So please, get those orders in now, as time is winding down. Thanks again, and
here's all the info:


Well howdy all. Those of you who have been around for a while might remember
the list t-shirts I printed up waaaaayyyy back when there was only one bus
list. Enough people have been asking me to do more, so I have finally agreed.
So, here's your chance to get a new and very much improved List t-shirt! Now
you can have something stylish to wear to bus events or to the office, to show
others your true coolness, and also easily recognize other listmembers at a
glance.
These have been officially sanctioned by list and domain masters Ken Hooper,
Thom Fitzpatrick, and Steve Dolan.

I've updated the design a bit to reflect the changing nature of the list. I
don't have pictures yet, but I shall describe it as best as possible. You can
go to my website at:
http://www4.ncsu_dot_edu/eos/users/r/rapalmer/www/
to see a couple pictures of the old design. This one will be somewhat similar,
but even better, and feature even more busses. There will be a total of 9
busses on the shirt, including 3 front views (Split, Loaf, and Air Cooled
Vanagon), and 6 side views, including a splitty camper, crew cab, sunroof
deluxe and panel van, and a late model single cab and pop-top.
I haven't discussed colors with the printer yet, but there will be at least 3
different colors, plus black and white.
Across the top of the shirt will be the word
NETVERGNU:GEN,
which is bastardized German for interNET pleasure. It's a takeoff from the
Fahrvergnu:gen VW campaign a few years ago.
The officially sanctioned www.type2_dot_com and www.vintagebus_dot_com addresses will
also be on the front of the shirt.
As a new feature, I'm going to offer the opportunity for all the early orderers
to have their email address or website address listed on the back of the shirt,
for a couple extra bucks. This will ONLY be possible for the early orderers.
obviously, once the shirts are printed, I can't add your name or address.

I am also doing a new batch of the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts.
Those went really fast, and are a great design, featuring a fireman's type
logo, with a VW logo in the center, and a picture of a splitty and early
Beetle, with the words &quot;Protect&quot; and &quot;Save&quot; on it. Lots of people have seen
this design, and can attest to it's desirability.

Finally, I'm doing a shirt specifically for the double and single cab owners
out there. Since VW trucks are super cool, and if you have one, you know you
get twice as many comments as bus drivers, I wanted to have a shirt just for
trucks.
It will have side views of a splitty double cab, and late model Single cab, and
the word &quot;Truckin'&quot; above that.

So anyway, here is the ordering procedure. For those of you who ordered before,
it's the same.
Send me:
an INDEX CARD, or piece of paper cut to that size.
on it, write:
1. Your name
2. your e-mail address
3. Your mailing address where you want the items sent
4. WHICH DESIGN you want, and quantity of each
5. SIZE you want
6. Your website or e-mail address, if you want it printed on the back.

also enclose a check made out to Richard Palmer for the amount, as figured
below.
Send it to:
Poor Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC 27605-1832

I plan to place the order near the middle of May, in time to have the shirts
for the upcoming Busses by the Lake event (details coming next week).
SO, PLEASE ORDER SOON!!!!
I can't afford to buy a lot of shirts up front, and then sell them. I can only
order a few extras, so please order soon. I'm offering the chance to have your
e-mail/website printed on the back as an incentive to get orders in soon.
I'm going to set Friday, May 21 as the deadline for all orders.
ok then here's the pricing information:
$13.00 - all designs, sizes children's M up through adult XL
$ 2.00 - add to base price, all designs, size XXL
$18.00 - all designs, long sleeve
$18.00 - all designs, tie-dyed
$ 2.00 - your website or e-mail address listed on the back of the shirt.
$ 8.00 - PER SHIRT overseas/non-US postage &amp; handling (please send US cash)
$ 5.00 - PER SHIRT shipping and postage for Priority Mail, USPS *** This amount
          also goes down with large purchases.***
$ 1.00 - List sticker (FREE with orders of 3 or more shirts)

***Special deals can be negotiated for advance purchase in quantity***
Basically, the more shirts I sell, the cheaper they cost. Since I can't put up
a lot of money up front to buy a huge amount, I can only afford to get what
gets ordered. It may be another year or two before I do this again, so Please,
please order soon. If you have any questions, just drop me an e-mail...I do
still have old list stickers, too...
