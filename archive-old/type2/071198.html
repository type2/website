I do know Beetlemex puts on an old floorpan before they are sent back to
America. Your &quot;new' Bug is actually registered with the original floorpan's
manufacture date. They have a website that explains the entire process and
gives cost, etc. I am no currency exchange expert, but I believe the new Type
2 would cost roughly between 8 and 11-thousand dollars if sold in the US. The
Mexico Type 2 is watercooled, the Brazilian Type 2 is not. If you go to either
VW site, notice how the roof is different, amongst interior improvements. Too
bad these are unavailable for US sale. I know I would get one in a heartbeat!
If you do a VW search on Yahoo, it will give you all of VW's sites around the
world, including the South Africa VW, where the Vanagon is still produced as
&quot;The Bus.&quot; They also still make a VW Rabbit(Golf I) and sell many. Interesting
reading!

Happy Busing!!
