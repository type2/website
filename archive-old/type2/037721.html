Subject: Hi everyone &amp; FI question

Hi everyone,

My name is Mike Pietsch (pronounced like peach) and I just bought my first
VW bus.  Well actually I bought two.  I have had Beetle's on and off for the
past 15 years since my first car which was a 73 Super Beetle, which youthful
ignorance destroyed :-( poor car. 

Bugs just don't work for hauling three kids, my wife and the dog out to the
beach, so I started thinking of a van.  I just couldn't bring myself to
leave the security of the reliability and simplicity of my old air-cooled
VW's and I naturally had to get a Type 2.

I saw a guy who had a '79 for $100.  Everything is there except for the
title and an explanation of why the engine is inside the van and not in the
engine compartment.  Lots of rust, oh lots of rust.  Then two days ago I
found a '77 that has been sitting for two years because a mechanic told the
girl who owned it that #3 was blown and the engine needed to be rebuilt.
Indeed removing a spark plug wire from #3 has absolutely no effect on the
engine.  I love VW engines because that will be fixed this weekend.  Went
back and bought that '79 for parts.

Two days ago I started looking for info on my acquisition, and found this
list.  I must say I am very happy to find this list.  Quite a sense of
community here, and a lot of folks who love their VW's - you're my kind of
people.  In just the past two days I have learned things just by reading in.
Thanks.  Many lists have come and gone from my e-mail but this is one I plan
to stay on for a while...so, I thought I would just say &quot;HI&quot; to everyone.

-------HI Everyone!------



Now my question is on the fuel Injection.  Thanks to a few catalogs floating
around the house, I have figured out that the '79's engine is different from
the '77/78 especially when it comes to the FI computer.  Beyond this, I
can't seem to figure out what the differences are.  Does anyone have any
idea of what the difference are between these two.

Thanks,

Mike Pietsch
