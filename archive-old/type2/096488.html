Subject: Re: [T2] Help me find an Oil breather hose

Richard,

Go find a vwflaps.  In Austin, there should be a ton of them.

The one about 40 miles from me has about 15 different size hoses
on reels on the wall...this is in a town one tenth the size of Austin....

Already replaced mine as it fell of one night shortly after I got the bus 
running.

Cheers ,dave

&gt; The day finally came: my oil breather hose is ruined and I'm stuck (luckily
&gt; I'm at home).  I tried the 5 major FLAPS in the area but all they have is
&gt; 3/4&quot; radiator hose.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone provide me a source for 22m or 7/8&quot; hose.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the state of my hose.  It's the original and the braids have no
&gt; strength and the rubber went hard.
