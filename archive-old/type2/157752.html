&gt; It was important to me to have a good, tough, shielded cable, and I wanted it right away, no ordering.

very long lengths, I went to Best Buy and bought 2) 25' Aucoustic
Research subwoofer connection lines, one was tagged as previously opened
and was marked down 6 bucks, so I got them both for 40 bucks, way under
&gt;my budget.

IMO, you still got ripped for about 35 bucks.  You didn't need
superdupercables for line level audio.  Ordinary RCA cables would have
worked fine.  They would been a lot more flexible and easier to route
too.
