        I am one of the intrepid Inuvikkers with a laptop. Both myself and
Ron used Apple PowerBook Duos, and ran the regular 110 power adapter off a
cheapy inverter (&quot;PowerToGo&quot; I think?). Of course, I don't have any clue
what kind of safty systems are incorperated into a Toshiba. The Mac power
adapters all have surge suppression built in, better than the el cheapo
surge suppressors at Kmart. My duo ran beautifully for 7 weeks on the road,
and it's only designed to be away from the docking station for a short
time. Ron had problems with his, but I don't think they were power
realated, more like software problems. And of course, there was Hoover,
sticking out from the pack as usual, with a full size PC, 2 heavy duty
inverters, and I believe 2 isolated batteries...   ;-)

Peace,
