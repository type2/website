Subject: RE: [T2] Change those fuel lines

&gt; That's about $3 cheaper a meter than I paid on
&gt; Tuesday, ouuuch....I can't tell from the picture 
&gt; but is that hose braided on the outside or 
&gt; smooth rubber with the reinforcment on the inside?


It varies depending on our supplier's inventory. At the moment I believe
the one we have is braided on the outside.
