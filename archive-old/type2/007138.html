 &gt; &gt;Only 2.0L engines from '78-'83 had hydraulic lifters.  The first two 
&gt; &gt;years of the 2.0, '76 and '77, did not have them.

Okay, while attempting to adjust the valves last night I convinced myself
that I gots hydraulic lifters.  All were~2 turns tight and at least 1
lifter felt like it had a spring in it.  This doesn't surprise me too much,
as the reciepts that came with it showed a lot of money well spent on
repairs, but nary a valve adjustment.  Now I'm hoping for a too rich
mixture situation.  So I've got these Solex 32-34s and cant find an obvious
mixture adjustment screw.  But it's spewing so much smoke that it might
want to be rejetted.  Still, I want to at least try to lean out the mix
before rejetting.  I've searched the archives with little luck on this
score.  Can anyone give me some visual references to where the mixture
adjustments are on these little carbs.  I guess I'd better start getting
some manuals.
Thanks for all the great help so far
Russell
