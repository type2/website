Subject: Re: [T2] Quick vacuum controlled EGR valve question

&gt; Are the vacuum controlled EGR valves better than the

The mechanical design seems simpler: you can take it apart, simple linkage
for adjustment. The older design has vacuum and electrical parts that can go
wrong and the vacuum can isn't serviceable. That unit, based on production
numbers alone, is also harder to find.
