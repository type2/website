Subject: Mid America Motorworks catalog

Those guys (formerlly RMMW) sent me a new catalog and it looks great but
unlike the RMMW catalog of old, they replaced all of the VW part numbers
with their own. Big thumbs down.

Some things I noticed in the catalog:

- OEVeedub seals
- Horse Hair seat pads
- that eBay escutcheon tool

Unfortunately everything in their catalog is way overpriced. Does a large
outfit like that really need to charge $40 for Bentley?
