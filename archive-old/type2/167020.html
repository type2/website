Subject: Re: [T2] RELIABLE kit source for conversion of '71 to LPG?

Hi Tank,

I figure it's your bus, you do what you want with it, as long as it's  
not going to harm anyone else on the road....

I would suggest you talk to Bob at BostonEngine_dot_com. Bob does work on  
VW industrial engines used in Zambonis which are propane powered, and  
will be more likely than most to know where to look. I doubt that  
there's a &quot;kit&quot; readily available, but I'd be plenty happy to be  
proven wrong about that.

 From what Bob has told me in personal conversation, propane runs  
hotter than gasoline; so I expect it may not be a popular conversion  
for air-cooled application.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Hi there. I've been away from the list for quite some time. But I'm  
&gt; back now, and after searching the archives and to hell and back on  
&gt; the www, I have a question.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of a _reliable_, tested source for LPG conversion  
&gt; kits for a 1971 camper? I'd like to get everything I need, perhaps  
&gt; minus the tank/s (shipping ouchy), in a kit rather than cobbling  
&gt; something together.
&gt;
&gt; Any helpful information will be greatly appreciated. Any snide  
&gt; remarks about converting my bus to LPG will be cheerfully ignored. ;-)
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks,
&gt;
&gt; tank
