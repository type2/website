Subject: brakes question: part 2

Hello Listers,
I wanted to let people know i appreciated the tip on disc brake bleeding for 
a 77 bus (wisdom gained: use the top bleeder valve). However, after 3 rounds 
of brake bleeding with the Mityvac and 2 rounds of brake bleeding with the 
old 2 person hose-in-jar method, i am still noticing that my brake pedal 
takes one &quot;pump&quot; to be where it should be. The bus stops fine, but i 
remember how the brakes were once-upon-a-time with only about 2 inches of 
pedal compression. the disc brake pads are new and the drum brake pads have 
less than 30k on them. the brake system does not leak a drop. and i had all 
the bubbles out of the line when bleeding....
So, what's the next step? am i needing to adjust out the rear drum pads? or, 
is the hose that goes off the top of the brake master cyl kinked? are there 
other possibilities?
Today's bus verse &quot;oh what can it be now?&quot;
Thanks,
Jeremy
'77 Westy
