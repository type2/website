	Changes in in health and life style force the liquidation of many essentials
and toys, the extra bus gotta go. 1976 Westfalia / automatic, 145k (40k on
rebuild), very little rust, needs complete exhaust / heat overhaul. The
muffler is shot and I was told everthing else is too far gone to save, one
heater box and possibly some cooling tin is missing. I feel the general
condition of the bus make it worth more than the $800 I have invested, but I'd
be real happy to get that for it, or would consider  a trade for a Rabbit
Pick-Up. E-mail with any questions, or pas along my # (609)
296-4889......Johnny
