&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; My 71 Campmobile has no exhaust at present, but looking around in a local
&gt; junkyard, I found a &lt;73&gt;Beetle with intact exhaust and perfect, rust free
&gt; exchangers. I know the exhaust is different, the question is, are the
&gt; exchangers? Can I use 'em on my bus? TIA

They will fit, but the levers are on the wrong side.  You can change them
over, but it requires welding.
