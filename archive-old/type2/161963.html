Yep. CA leads the way in irritation when it comes to cars.

&gt; The nuts and bolts appear to be a problem with the spout that is
&gt; available for the wedco cans.  According to the CARB page, the nozzle
&gt; has to close automatically and prevent overfilling among other things.

The first time I used it, I spilled gas all over my motorcycle. The  
second time, I couldn't get any gas into my wife's car. The third  
time on the bus I still got splash back. This is nuts.

I'm motivated to try to do something to make sure these gas cans  
don't go out of production or have extremely limited availability  
because the laws prevent their sale in only a couple of states. Maybe  
I'll put up a website showing how stupid the blitz can is, show the  
fire hazard and let the lawyers run them out of town.
