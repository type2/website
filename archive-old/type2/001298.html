Hey listees -

My 2 cents on this is as follows:

I owned a 69 Bronco of the same type as another member of this list (sorry I
can't remember who). The hand throttle on it was for operation a low speeds,
off-road, in situations where a slow, steady throttle had to be maintained,
like rock crawling. I would never trust it over 10mph because it doesn't
automatically disengage when the clutch or brake is pressed.
However, when I was in FLAPS the other day, I saw a universal cruise control
kit for either auto or manual trans which claimed to disengage
automatically. Can't remember who made it (didn't know I'd need to!) but
I'll check again and post in the next day or so.

Thomas
