Subject: number of hoses on vacuum advance dizzy
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11011F4C73_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

Someone stated that a FI dizzy will not have two vaccuum hoses. 
Well my 76 has them, and the other FI van I pulled  a replacement dizzy from
had two hoses as well.
Note this is in Canada - YMMV.
