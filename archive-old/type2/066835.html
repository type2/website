&gt; Early September. Daddybus. The Anchorage-Fairbanks-Tok-Glenallen-Anchorage
&gt; loop, with a sidetrip down to Seward and Homer. Maybe a side-trip up to
&gt; the hot springs (then again, maybe not). Visit the old stomping grounds
&gt; and show my daughter Willow from whence she came (spiritually, if not
&gt; physically). Maybe with a nice white 'vert bug for day trips.
&gt; 
&gt; Saw a short PBS piece on Kenai Fjords last night. I guess I'm getting
&gt; nostalgic again.

For me, the Alaska trek would also be it.  I did it in my '72 (with 1600 
DP) summer before last. The most beautiful, moving places I've ever seen. 
Kenai Fjords, Kenai Peninsula, Richardson Highway being my favorite 
parts. There's just no trip like it (although I've heard great things 
about Siberia - maybe someday...)

Definitely hit Liard Hot Springs on the way. And those never-ending 
summer days. Where do I sign?
