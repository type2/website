Subject: Re: [T2] Mexibeetle

Tony,

It is *not* illegal...not even technically.  It is a 19xx vehicle that has 
been completely restored in the full sense of the word.

Title is the same as the pan....just cause you dropped a new car on top of 
it doesn't matter to the gubment.  

Insurance wise, it should be the same as for any of our **restored**
vehicles.  After I drop that much money on a bus and expect to get it 
insured for replacement cost, it's going to take an appraiser and the 
right insurance company...and money.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &lt;&lt; For most vw folks, the $11,500 price is a bit steep unless you look at it 
&gt; as a &quot;new car&quot;....which it mostly is.  They sure do look nice with 
&gt; metallic paint though. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; OK, but the problem is that it's registered as a 19... Beetle. Is $11,500
&gt; the insurable price even as a completely restored 19... Beetle? After
&gt; all, you can't tell the insurance company what it really is, they take
&gt; a dim view of insuring a technically illegal vehicle...
