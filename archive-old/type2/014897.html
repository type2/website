It is that time of year again...

Peach State Transporters will be holding it's 3rd Annual Dead of
Winter Campout at Cloudland Canyon State Park in the NW Georgia
mountains February 6-7.  The park is off GA 136, 8 miles east of
Trenton and I-59, 18 miles NW of Lafayette.  Those interested can
email me for more details.

Last year we had to relocate to Sloppy Floyd State Park due to snow,
but we still had a great time and had about a dozen buses.  Let's 
shoot for about 20 this year.

This year we will be camping on the western rim, because they have 
the campground in front of the cabins closed.  There are 25 sites 
available and they will allow us to double up on sites, but our past 
performance this year tells us that reservations for a camp site 
might not be a bad idea...

&quot;Located on the western edge of Lookout Mountain, Cloudland
Canyon is one of the largest &amp; most scenic state parks in Georgia.
The park provides visitors with beautiful vistas of the rugged
geology of this area and an excellent outdoor setting for the camper
or hiker wanting to experience the beuty of the natural world.&quot;

Additional info on Cloudland Canyon is available at:

The first site is from the DNR &amp; the 2nd one has a few photos of 
the area.

So pack some warm clothes and I hope to see you there.

Dave
