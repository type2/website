&gt; Bob,

&gt; (I know you know already know this stuff, but if it helps)
&gt;
&gt; Did you try a new coil and check your coil polarity? (you know 1 = negative
&gt; 15 = +)

yup, new coil, removed Crane and put points back in too.


&gt; Also you didn't crank the engine over or move the position of the crank with
&gt; the dizzy out or loose did you? If so, your distributor drive gear may have
&gt; skipped to the next bracket. It will run, but like total crap.

hmmmm,  not that I am aware of but?!

&gt; Is your dizzy spring in place? Do you have the correct endplay on the dizzy
&gt; shaft? Are the fiber shims missing? If any of the above, the shaft will ride
&gt; up and down too high and make the points do a very bad version of the
&gt; Lambada.

will have to double check

&gt; Also, does your dizzy bolt down completely flush to the case? If not, it can
&gt; ride just on the top of the drive gear and only intermittently grab.

???? I think so.

&gt; (I only suggest these things because I have had all of the above happen to
&gt; me on a Type 4 and Type 1 motor)
&gt;
&gt; I wish I were there to help! At least you know the motor/heads are good with
&gt; the compression corrected! Chris is battling the same compression problems
&gt; with a mismatched Vanagon/'79/'78 motor and heads some nut-job put together.

I feel for Chris, the dang type 4 motor does not make getting to the heads
easy.
