Subject: [T2] starting fluid

&gt;Went to school for 4 years, and have a degree in automotive. Do not use ether starting fluid, you can cause major engine &gt;damage to
your motor. VW engines are not made to run on ether. This will put major strain on rods, crank, ect. Best bet is &gt;to use some carb
cleaner. In school, we used to use a small propane tank with a tube, and a valve to check for vac leaks. &gt;I'm not so sure thats too
good either. Carb cleaner should not hurt the engine in the least.

WD-40 is an effective non-flammable compression leak tool.
You can also use brake parts or carb aerosol cleaner.
Starting fluid is extremely dangerous for this application.
A fog of starting fluid is very explosive.

&gt;Starting fluid is generally made for diesel engines. Their rods are made for high compression. A VW is not. I may be &gt;mistaken but
this is what I learned in  college.

A diesel engine works by compressing kerosene ( or fuel oil ) until it explodes.
Starting fluid is too volatile all by itself, and will destroy a diesel immediately.
A more correct starting fluid for a diesel engine would be WD-40 !
