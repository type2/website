Subject: Re: [T2] synthetic vs. regular oil

Actually, I had heard that for an aircooled engine, the heat-transfer

trust.

&gt;that synthetic oil is WORSE because over time a
&gt;plastic laquer will build up in your engine from the
&gt;plastic in the synthetic oil. whats the real story?
&gt;thanks in advance.
