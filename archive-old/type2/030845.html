Volks,

Mr. Smith isn't here anymore.

&quot;For sale&quot; ads for VW buses and for parts for VW buses are and have always
been absolutley appropriate to the list.  I encourage them highly!  &quot;For
sale&quot; ads for non-buses and non-bus related parts, however, are a dead
flat &quot;no go&quot;. 

Please limit the ads to VW bus related items.  If you have a big list and
it's 90% Bus, and a bug windshield, or if you have tools that can be used
on a bus, like your old compressor, yeah, that's fine, but use common
sense, please.
