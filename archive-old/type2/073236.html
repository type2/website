I've been getting the most amazing amount of mail about this. Like two a
day. The script in question was custom written in C by Yvan Rodriguez and
when we changed servers it all had to be recompiled and somehow nobody but
Yvan can get it to work--he has a life and it takes a while. Bear with us,
we'll have it back soon.

Other web page notes: We'll be doing a local copy of the Library of Josh
Rodgers and picking up where he left off because that is the best way to
honor him; Ron Van Ness appears determined to put together the best single
bus resource on the web all by himself; we'll be bringing back a *limited*
Sermons page with the &quot;Free Horsepower&quot; stuff and maybe some new
illustrated material.

Stable for a month, seems rock-solid: irc.type2_dot_com server, we tend to hang
out in #buslist by habit but all VWs are welcome, make all the channels you
like.

&gt;
&gt;Dear Type 2
&gt;
&gt;When do you envision your buy/sell link being up?  I am looking for a westy
&gt;camper to buy and your buy/sell link when it is operational is a great
&gt;starting point.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
&gt;
&gt;-KJ
