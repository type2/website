&gt; Bus content:  I expect to add an ignition off/radio &quot;on&quot; switch to my bus
&gt; this weekend and also add a complete alarm system/keyless entry/remote
&gt; start.

I recently saw at NTB an alarm battery, it was an alarm system built into
the battery.  same old beep, beep beep, turning off on etc. has
radio/clock terminal that allows the low drain stuff to keep working but
when armed though it will not allow the vehicle to start.  might be an
inexpensive/easy way to put an alarm in a bus.

&gt; Happy Thanksgiving to all of those still here and who might be here!

and to you and the list also

Bob
