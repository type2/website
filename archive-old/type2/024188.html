&lt;&lt; et's say you drive 12,000 miles per year, your normal
 fuel-consumption is 15mpg (which is true of my '69 Westy) and gas is
 at a constant price of $1.00/gallon. Oil changes at every 3,000 miles.
 Also, figure in that &quot;normal oil consumption for a VW&quot;, per my owners
 manual, is 1.7-4.8 pints per 1,000 miles; we'll use a quart per 1,000
 miles for comparison. Again, for the sake of comparison, we'll use
 $1.85 per quart of regular oil and $4.75 per quart of synthetic. We'll
 also say the fuel savings with synthetic is 1.5 mpg.

i admit you are real close on your math.  except you have omitted two
important factors.
you have not included the price of the filters for 4 oil changes during the
12,000 miles.  and synthetics go a MINIMUM of 7500 miles before being changed.
some even some of mobil 1s brand are recommended to go 15-25,000  depending on
if you purchase their top of the line product or not. next time in your local
FLAPS and browse the oil section and see what the recommended oil change
frequency is, shoot for that matter i just saw a commercial yesterday for
quaker state ( regular oil ) that was claiming to be improved for *extended
oil drain frequencies*  for those times youforget to change at 3,4  even 5000
miles. so if they can say that about a regular old crappy oil, man .....any
synthetic can definitely go 7500 to 15k. (which is what most synthetic
manufacturers recommend for their own oils anyway. synthetics are by no means
needing to be changed at 3000.  and if you do change syn. at 3000,  the
savings i mentioned before do not apply.  anyways just something else to
consider when figuring this out.
