Subject: RE: [T2] What engine is this?

&gt; The only number I saw was &quot;GD042787&quot;.


GD engine code would be a '76-77 2000cc solid-lifter Bus engine. You can
find the number stamped on the top of the block near the oil breather. It is
also on the fan shroud, but all that really proves is that the fan shroud
was from a '76-77.
