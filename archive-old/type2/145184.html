&gt; Sorry for re-posting this, but I'm really stuck for
 an answer. Can anyone help at all? Summary: Am I
correct
 in thinking that a '72-'74 EGR filter will *not* fit
 on my '78 that has a '72-'74 exhaust conversion?
(the original '78 filter doesn't fit)
 
Wellllll.......

Does your muffler have an EGR port on the left end? 

411-412 mufflers do. The drawback to the 411 muffler
is the center-to-center studs for the EGR filter. They
are closer together then on the bay 76-78 EGR filter. 

You would need to find a 411-412 EGR filter and the
411 muffler.
Or get this muffler:
