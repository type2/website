Subject: Event Name Tags-A Good Idea

Dear Folks,

Jamie Rivers posted this message to the Vintage Bus list and as touring/show
season is upon us, I think he's got a very good point -

&quot;Something I have never seen on the list is a List Name Tag
I have seen ,,, see me at the Yellow bus at 10..  etc,, but what if the
Yellow Bus is forced to stay in the parking lot and the Listee walks right
by you,,, you'd never know..
So ,, My question, is there a  &quot;Hi , My Name is  Mr Bus Driver &quot;   tag
available?  :-)
or is there an artistic Listeee that could create a image that could be
printed out and pinned to our proud chests?
I was trying to design one that would slip into a clear plastic sleeve with
a pin .. the kind you get at trade shows etc,&quot;

Personally, I *hate* name tags, but I'd *really hate* not getting to meet
some of you while staring you straight in the eye! Maybe we could just do
some kind of highly recognizable logo (like the line drawing of the bus on
the Type 2 web site) and use that instead of plastering our names to our
chests...sort of like a brotherhood/sisterhood high sign...&quot;Oh! You're on
the Type 2/VB/Vanagon list! Hi! I'm ____!&quot;

Just  a thought.

Chris and Gus the &quot;WHEN ARE WE LEAVING FOR THE SHOW?!!!&quot; Bus
