Subject: RE: Exhaust valves at .008?

&gt;If memory serves, Muir adresses this issue, claiming firmly that it's
&gt;0.006&quot;, and to &quot;put a piece of tape over that sticker if it bothers you.&quot;

Naw, that's a different situation. He's covering the sticker that says to
set the Type II valves all to .004. Nothing to do with the Type IV valves.
Pre-72 folks should pay no attention to none of this, just go right on and
do .006.

(How do you guys know whether your valves are sodium-filled or not? Do you
cut them open? Is there salt in there? If the core is hollowed out, does
that not weaken them? I never understood what any of this meant.)
