&gt; A good friend has sent me a couple of links that tell how acetone - in small 
&gt; quantities - will raise your fuel mileage. Anyone know if this is for real?

I'd bet that adding just about any volatile liquid in the tank will boost mileage somewhat. Think about it, you fill your tank until the pump stops(if the financing goes thru :-)), and then add an extra pint or quart of stuff. Now you have a full tank plus a bit more, so you're going to go a few more miles on that tankful. That's the answer that the tappet bros. gave a caller, I think it makes sense. They also say that when you try these mileage boosting snake oils, you are likely to drive more carefully, which is what really boosts mpg
