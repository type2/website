Subject: Tank Crud - Alternatives?

Hey Folks!

First off, thanks to all those regulars on this list; it's amazing how
supportive you are to newbies like myself! You really help keep owning these
cars fun (even in the bad times).

So I'm a pretty new owner of a 72 bus. I fear pretty serious &quot;tank crud&quot;
issues; I should have known when I bought the bus and it had two fuel
filters next to each other! Now that the weather is getting a little nicer
here I really think I should address this problem. I pulled off the carb
tonight and what came out was not pretty. I read Richard's POR-15 approach,
and this is what I was thinking of doing. My big concern is my wife-to-be
will kill me if I hurt our lawn in any way! But really, I want to be able to
dispose of these chemicals properly, and that's kind of tough in my town.
Any advice for alternatives? Are there any shops which may be better setup
to do this?

-Josh
