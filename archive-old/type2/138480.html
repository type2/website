Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(update)

Phil said:

&quot;I have ran out of Ideas, it has to be a blowby problem
but I don't see why. There has to be someway to vent
the case to prevent this.. Phil&quot;

Barry says:

I came across some type 4 heads (from a 914 or a 412) that were vented into 
a 't' going into the oil breather.  These 'vents' were not simply drilled 
into the upper lip of the head, just below the rim where the valve cover 
fits, but were molded in there with some extra support around the holes.

this could be a solution to an unresolved problem.

What about that oil pressure thing-a-ma-bob that has that weird screw slot 
(fatish and long and dished).  Could that be something??
