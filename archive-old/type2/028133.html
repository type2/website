As soon as I sent the last note, it occurred to me that recommending you explore the BeetleMex engine didn't really answered your questions. How rude of me!

Price: $3000 seems high to me, but I'm a do-it-yerselfer and don't get these kind of quotes often. Last time was 1986 and dude built me a 40,000 mile engine for $1200. Ouch!

Prognosis: At those rates, I'd be concerned about what I'd get from a re-torque/re-adjust. A valve adjustment could yield considerable performance gains; a retorquing of the heads...well, if your heads are really loose, something's hammered. Sure, retorque 'em if you can, but if this guy is doing it, he'll pull the engine and charge accordingly. Have you asked about the cost therein? I truly have no experience here, but I wouldn't count on much more than 2,000-5,000 miles on the adjustment/retorquing if there's really something wrong.

If it were me, I'd go pick it up (in the morning, unannounced so he couldn't screw anything up if he thought I was bailing on him), pay him for the inspection, tell him I can't afford it now and I'd call when I could, and I'd take the bus home. I'd plan on it being down for at least 2 days, maybe a week if free time is scarce. I'd let it sit overnight or until cool and then run the valve adjustment procedure. IFF (programmer's &quot;if and only if&quot;) there wasn't a noticeable improvement in power and IFF compression tests revealed low compression (with adjusted valves), I'd pull the rockers and retorque the lower bolts...no actually, I'd pull the engine and replace the cylinders and check everything else out and end up spending 3 weeks and $600 on a rebuild; then, once it was running just right, I'd sell it at a loss...but we're really talking about *your* options and I think Kristy's got me signed up for therapy anyway. DON'T *OVER-TORQUE* ANYTHING ON A VW ENGINE!

There are some other things I'd check/consider as well:

- slipping clutch?
- vacuum leaks (especially those intake boots)
- worn points (this will fool you in a hurry! check the plastic tang of the points)
- damaged plug wires (including coil wire)

The problem is that you don't know if the mechanic is honest or not; you may have a very simple problem but you won't know unless you investigate enough to control the variables. Of course, maybe you've done all these things already...in which case I guess I'll copy my reply to the list since symptoms/problems run in packs of at least three. So the other two people with your same problems will at least get the benefit (or lack thereof) of my thoughts.
