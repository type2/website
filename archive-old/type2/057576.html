One of my clients came in and said there was a VW camper for sale just down
the street. I went to look. :-)

85 Westie. Nice inside. Owner says everything works. Canvas intact. Needs
top
seal. Good original paint, did not look underneath. Auto trans and AC. New
longblock made by VW (saw the sticker) just installed by the dealer. Saw the
reciept, owner paid $3,800 for the engine installed very recently. I noted
that the belt to some thing on the right side (auto trans pump ???) had come
off and suggested he find out what that was about before driving. AC belt
also
off, but he reported the AC was working, so must have come off today. Asking
$5,000. Seems like an honest guy, but never met him before today. Contact
him,
not me, but will look again if you have questions as it is only 1 mile away.

PS: I still have the '82 window bus for sale that needs an engine. $800.00
