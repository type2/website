&gt; &gt; (Tom Tarka) Again, my curiosity has been piqued:  has anyone who
&gt; &gt; experienced rear wheel bearing failure and replaced only the one
&gt; &gt; that failed, later experienced failure in the other wheel?
&gt; 
&gt; No, but here's some evidence nonetheless:
&gt; 
&gt; I experienced a failure in right rear bearing (actually not a failure, just
&gt; a very loud vibration/humming noise at highway speeds).  I replaced that
&gt; ~4000 miles ago, and discovered that the bearing failure was probably
&gt; related to a loose axle nut (the 46mm jobbie) at some point in it's life.  

I wonder if this isn't a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem... does the failing
bearing vibrate the nut loose or does the loose nut allow the bearing to
fail?  I am still editing pics and composing report, but once I get thru
that, I will be rebuilding the dead stub axle and will post pics.

One wonder I do have in rebuilding is that the inner and outer surfaces on
the hub and the castle nut are badly deformed.  I am thinking of taking
them to a machinist and seeing if they can be ground flat.  Any reason not
to?  I don't see the dimension as being critical element.
