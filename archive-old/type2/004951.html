Subject: hand brake cable length and brake shoe questions

Hi volks,
I am getting ready to redo my back brakes and have a question.   As I am price
comparing I found

Bus Depot offers hand brake cables for late 71-79 bus for 9.95  the length of
this is 2966MM
RMMW offers hand brake cables for 72-79 bus for 12.95 the length of this is
2960 MM

Which would be correct?  I know they both can't be right.

Also I noticed there is a difference in rear brake shoes during the 73 model
year (my bus year) at chassis number 213 210 2497.  My bus is 233 210 0455.  I
have read several accounts of VW going back and forth around the chassis
number switch to get rid of parts so..... Does any one know how to tell the
difference in the two different shoes?

Just FYI on this part
Bus Depot 29.95
RMMW 24.95

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
