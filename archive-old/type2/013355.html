Subject: Type 4 acceptable oil pressure levels
To: type2 &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi All,

I have a 73' Westy with a GEX 1.8L hydraulic valve
engine in it.  It has around 40K on it and is my daily
driver.

I am not too secure with the oil pressure I am running
and would like feedback on what things should be. 
Other particulars are I live in the North West corner
of Oregon so temp is moderate.  I am running 20/50
Castrol with Mahle filter.  The gauge setup I have is
a VDO electric sender and gauge.  At cold idle I am at
65/70 PSI, as things heat up and I'm zooming down the
freeway at 60/65 it goes as low as 20PSI.  At hot idle
it is 8/10 PSI by the gauge, the oil light never
flickers or comes on.  Is this a normal range for this
vehicle?

Thanks in advance!
Brian
