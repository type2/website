Are you sure...?-(
If you're gonna pay &quot;a lot&quot; for a rust-free Bus, be sure to spend
&quot;a lot&quot; of time inspecting it...Get under with an ice pick and poke 
around &quot;a lot&quot; to see if there's rust under the sparkly paint...
Even original paint can hide &quot;a lot&quot; of rust...And undercoat is
also suspect...Once it cracks, it becomes a perfect storm for
rust...Holding the moisture against the metal and concealing it
from enquiring minds...
