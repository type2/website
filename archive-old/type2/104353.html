&gt; Our when our local VW mechanic inspected our bus, he told us that we had a
&gt; good-sized hole in the heater box. He said that this needed to be fixed
&gt; soon, and the bus definitely couldn't run without the heater box as it is
&gt; part of the cooling system, and this could damage the engine.
&gt; Does this make sense to anyone out there?

talking about a type IV engine, how is the heater box part of the cooling
system, no air gets to the heater boxes until AFTER it is finished cooling
the engine. 
  just make sure the little piece of tin under the cyl but above the push
rod tubes stays on....been running mine without heater boxes for about 6
years and I have temp guages and it is the same as it was before, no
changes

YMMV
