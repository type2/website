Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

Interesting item and a lot cheaper that the holley disconnects that i 
have used in the past on racing engines.
the web site for the makers and you can download a pdf catalog that 
lists them and some other fuel line cutoffs.  Note that some of these 
items have engine size limitations.

&gt; Happy Friday all
&gt; In the year or so I have been on this list it seems that
&gt; the subject of how to stop the gas from flowing when
&gt; removing fuel lines has come up at least 3 or 4 times. I
&gt; have been meaning to post this info for some time and
&gt; today I finally got around to it.
&gt; While perusing one of my motorcycle catalogs (Chapparral
&gt; at http://www.800-841-2960_dot_com/) I saw these nifty Quick
&gt; disconnect couplings that shut off fuel flow when you
&gt; pull them apart. They are claimed to be compatible with
&gt; all types of gas or racing fuel and come in 1/4(part#306-
&gt; 1229 $13.99) and 5/16(part#306-1230 $14.99) sizes (kinda
&gt; strange since most of the bikes that this catalog caters
&gt; to are metric. They are made by Motion Pro and can
&gt; likely be ordered through any motorcycle shop.
&gt; I haven't used one myself so no firsthand knowledge.
