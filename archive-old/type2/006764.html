Subject: LAST CALL shirts- Search &amp; Rescue, bus, other

Happy Friday. Thanks to those of you who have already sent in your shirt
orders. This is the last call, as I will be placing the order a week from
today, on Friday, September 14th. So if you're planning to order, please send
it in the next couple days so it will be here in time. One other new addition-
thanks to a very persuasive list administrator, I will also be offering the
Search &amp; Rescue shirts in Fireman colors- a navy shirt with white printing. If
you want one of those, please specify that on the card. Other than that, here's
all the info again:

  Since the last run of Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team shirts sold
so quickly, I am doing another run. I will also be reprinting the Truckin'
shirts, with the single cab and double cab graphic, a frontal shot of a
split-window bus, and also a logo shirt for my new website- TeamSpatula_dot_com
Pictures of the designs are viewable at:

http://teamspatula_dot_com/tshirts.html

You can also see Thom's panel with the Search &amp; Rescue logo at:
http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=search+and+rescue

Anyway, For those of you new to this process, I am offering the shirts by
pre-order, which means that I will take orders up until September 14, and then
place the order for shirts with the printer. After the shirts are printed, I
will ship them out to you.
All shirts are 100% pre-shrunk cotton, usually Hanes Beefy T's or Fruit of the
Loom. Search &amp; Rescue shirts will be exactly as they appear on the website, or
also available in a navy t-shirt with white printing (please specify color
choice)
Truckin' shirts will also be on a gray shirt, and tie-dye will NOT be an option
this time. The split window shirt is a front view of a red and white bus on a
blue t-shirt.

Shirts are $15.00 each for short sleeve, and are available in sizes child's M
   through adult XL.
Adult XXL and XXXL are available for $20.00.
Long sleeve shirts are available for $20.00
****Shipping and handling is $5.00 per shirt****


What I need:
send check or money order payable to:
Richard Palmer
121-C Park Ave
Raleigh, NC 27605-1832
Also, send an index card with your name, mailing address, e-mail address, SIZE
of shirt, DESIGN of shirt(Search &amp; Rescue, Truckin', Split), and QUANTITY of
shirts.

I had hoped to have PAYPAL set up for this run, but it's not quite ready.
Anyway, feel free to e-mail me with any questions. I have sold shirts here for
the last 6 years, and have many happy customers as references.
Thanks, and happy bussing!
