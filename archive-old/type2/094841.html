Subject: Dodge City, Kansas


I've heard there is a kick butt little VW parade in Dodge City, Kansas, on 
the 4th of July.  Anybody have info on this event?  I'll be in that area and 
would like to bring my little Westy over for the morning.

Thanks.

I wake up every morning determined both to change the world and have one
hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.
