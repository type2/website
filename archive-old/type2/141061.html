Subject: Re: [T2] heating controls ?? 

From Tracy Bonin:

Hi, just a few ??s. First I was trying to see if the heating was working in  the bus last night, I know that
it worked in the spring when i bought it, but couldn't figure out the controls. There are the 2 red levers
(heat) 2 blue levers (cold), but what positions do they have to be in to work (all the way up or down) then
there are the 2 round vents on the dash which is for the outside air? or heat? then the vents at the
footwells, which i believe is for outside air. Also there is a round button that pulls out at the drivers side
pedestal , what is that for? Any help is appreciated.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The round end dash vents are fresh air only. No heat.
The vents at the feet are heat.

The blue levers are cold air. UP is off.

The red levers are heat. UP is off.
The right red lever controls volume. All the way down opens the heater flapper valves and turns on the blower
fan.
The left red lever controls where you get the heat. Halfway down is floor, all the way down is defrost.

Not sure about the knob??      What year is your bus?  [since you have 2 blue levers, you have a 68-72 bus,
correct?]
And do you have a gas heater in it?

Here is the '70 owners manual:
2E is the knob, it is for the center seater.
