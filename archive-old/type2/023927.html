i think that this is a wonderful idea.  About a month or so ago i posted 
stating that i was planning on travelling cross country in my 1970 westy. 
just knowing that there are indiviuals out there that are willing to lend a 
hand tends to make me worry less. i agree whole heartedly to this idea :)
peace
