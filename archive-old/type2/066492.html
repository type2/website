&gt; Sorry, this is not bus related, but I thought most would be interested
&gt; to hear that the asking price for a &quot;time-capsuled&quot; '79 beetle
&gt; convertible with 91 (!) original miles is $19,750. Seen in
&gt; Pennsylvania this weekend.

&gt; Sami ('75 Westf.)

Actually nearly every issue of Hemmings is littered with '79
convertibles some never titled with like 21 miles and all
origional shipping seat covers etc.  Top price there is usually
a bit shy of $20k ranging down to $14k asking for ones with
under 20,000 miles.  79's seem to ask more as the last year,
a mint '77 or '78 commanding several thousand less.

Ludicrous IMHO anyway you slice it.
