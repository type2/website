I have to comment on this whole thing as well...

I drove my 71 bus daily for 2 years and maybe twice somebody came up to me
and said something about it.  Now i have been driving a split daily and
the yahoos come out of the woodwork...

I dont mind about 1/3 of em, the rest i wish would leave me alone.

But really im kind of a keep-to-myself guy... i almost want to paint my
bus camoflague or something so that people will stop noticing me and i can
drive in peace.

I drive a bus because i like driving busses, not because i want attention
from every ???.  I mean yokels in pickup trucks stare with their jaw
hanging open and drunken wannabe hippy teenagers pump their fists seeking
my approval as they drive by.

I liked it better when the general public ignored busses, but thats just
me... In some ways even though i like my split i prefer driving the bay as
it attracts less attention... But then again someone at a stoplight
yesterday started asking me if i wanted to sell my 71 POS, maybe the
party's over there too.

take care,

Steve
