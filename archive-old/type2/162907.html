	      The VW Type 2 list was just pointed to

&gt;http://www.brpfoundation_dot_org/vwbus_movie.php


	and one member commented

I think that's the most beautiful thing I've even seen.  How did they 
manage to coordinate a backfire from every bus as it went by?

	which makes me wonder what porgram I need to view that movie. 
Can you advise?
