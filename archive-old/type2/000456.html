Hello,

A couple of weeks ago I posted a message asking for recommendations on new
tires for a '71 Westy.  Well, after shopping around at various tire stores
in the Seattle area, I found that Les Schwab had the best deal on a light
truck, all season, all terrain C load rated (1700 lbs. max for each tire)
tire in a size 185R14.  In fact, it was the only light truck, all season,
all terrain C load rated tire in a size 185R14.  All other 185R14 tires that
I found (that were actually in stock) were either reinforced passenger tires
(all season, but not all terrain) or highway rib light truck tires.

The brand name on the Les Schwab tire is Jupiter and the tire is made in
Korea.  After having these tires installed, I noticed a vast improvement in
the stability and the handling of my '71 Westy.  I no longer feel nervous
driving in the rain (which is an almost every day occurrence in Seattle).
So, if you live in the Pacific Northwest, I would highly recommend these
tires.  In addition, Les Schwab's service is terrific -- I won't even
comment on the service that I received at Sears.

Regards,
Leo Seymour
