Subject: Re: Zelenda (???) and 12-point bit

        When I did my CV's, I borrowed the tool from a friend who works on
VW's.  It was marked 'Mattco', but I'm sure you could get one from Snap-On
or another similar outfit.  I loosened all the 12pt bolts on my parts bus
for future ease of removal, and returned the tool to my friend.  Then, when
installing them, I used the 6mm hex bolts from my '74 so that I would never
need to borrow that 8mm 12pt again.  If you don't want to mess with that
tool again, get some 6mm bolts to replace those 12pts.  Just a suggestion --
good luck :)
