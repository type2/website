&gt; Gentlepersons-
&gt; ...Saw a lovely split-window in NYC, Saturday, downtown. From my per-
&gt; spective, I couldn't see the plate but it was blue and white and had &quot;Mein
&gt; Schmerz&quot; painted in one corner of the cargo hatch. Anybody's? Anybody's German
&gt; better than mine and could translate? Oh, yeah, apologies if this translates
&gt; to a non-pc/family/what- ever-oriented English...

Mein Schmerz is a colloquialism in this case. It means, &quot;this damn Bus
breaks down all the time.&quot;
