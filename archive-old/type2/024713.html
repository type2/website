&lt;&lt; asked earlier if anyone remembered the URL or web-site name on this
 subject. I then searched the archives....no go. I then searched the
 'net using MetaCrawler with the words &quot;oil additives&quot;. From this
 search, I found what I was looking for....
 
 Before buying that &quot;miracle&quot; additive, check the following
 URL....http://www.ll_dot_net/spider/snake.htm or do your own search. 
  &gt;&gt;

this is an excellent site for understanding those * additives *.....it is a
very long page site....read throught carefully it is very well written and
simply stated.  they have the very last 5 or six paragraphs on synthetics,
dont forget to read that also.  thanks jaime...i added it to my list of
favorites for research sites.
