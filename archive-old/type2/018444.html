Rosemary,

This helps with the junkyard search!

Is the rabbit mount a 3-point mount (base attachment, shoulder suspender
and female latch), or is it a 2 point (base attachment above your
shoulder and then female latch)?

Just curious,

Lauria

&gt;     I got my retractables from a Rabbit.  They work great and allow
&gt; movement!  Make sure you get a complete set with the receiver (or whatever
&gt; you call the thing) that you snap the belt into.
