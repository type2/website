&lt;&lt; I have a 32/36 DCAV carb that I rebuilt. How does the
choke work? &gt;&gt;

Just checking...Isn't that the water activated choke? (A - Agua?) I 
think the carb for VW is DFEV with an electric choke. The one you
have might have come from a few other cars...Fiats, a few small
engined Fords, etc.
