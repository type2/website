Subject: RE: pedal seals in '66

I believe that you have two problems.
1) The seals go on the other side of the floor, so that they are pushed up
against the bottom of the floor when the pedal is at rest.  (I don't believe I
have ever seen one on the inside of a bus.)
2) As someone else mentioned, you may be missing the pan that covers the
mechanisms, thus allowing much more air movement than the system was designed
for.  This pan should always be used, as it protects vital parts from weather
and road hazards.

Good luck,
terry

I've got a lot of draft coming up thru the holes around my pedals, and
I'm a little tired of seeing the road thru the floor...especially with 
fall happening and all.

I _think_ I've got the proper seals/boots for the pedals, but they don't 
appear to work, they certainly don't stay on the floor, but ride up the 
pedal shaft where they do no good.

Could some kind sole explain to me how these are supposed to work?  Does
one have to lubricate the pedal shaft?

Thanks for any info,
...Markus
