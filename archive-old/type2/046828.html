Here is silly old me, selling my 1973 bus for $2,500. Even thinking of lowering the price even more!!

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;orangevw&quot; &lt;orangevw_at_email.msn_dot_com&gt; 10/06/00 09:24AM &gt;&gt;&gt;
sold a 71 westy pop-top, two years ago for $ 7171.00.  The po was an auto
detail guy, so the exterior looked like it had been sitting in a showroom
for 20 years.  I  put a new stock 1600 long block and a new trany in it, was
taking it for a road test, w/ just a for sale sign in the side window.  A
neighbor heard me/saw me drive by, followed me back to my place. bought it
for the exact asking price.

I currently have a 71 westy w/no- pop top, *sitting in my driveway* that is
sold, for:  $7500.00.  Has new stock engine &amp; trany, w/exterior restoration
complete.  The interior is completely stripped.  The new owner will do the
interior restoration himself.........

I was offered $6,000 for the *71 westy*  The Free Bus, last month.

&gt; Just this week I saw a '79 (?) Westy for sale here on the list for an
asking
&gt; price of $8,000.00. Has anyone actually ever sold a bay Westy for this
much?
&gt; Has anyone ever paid this (or more) for one. I see a lot advertised for 6,
&gt; 7,8 thousand and more, but always wonder if  anyone has actually
bought/sold
&gt; one for this much. Just curious.    Jeff S.
