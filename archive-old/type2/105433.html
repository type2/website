Subject: Re: [T2] stuck sunroof on 69

&gt; scenario: 69 decent shape sunroof is available in the next town over. the
&gt; crank on the sunroof turns but not opening the hatch; feels like its not
&gt; catching. up front a few inches right (passenger side) of the crank it
&gt; appears as if at least one of the cables is binding, perhaps broken/bunged.
&gt; i didn't want to force it hard with the headliner being pretty good. any
&gt; solutions? what might be a next step?   -steve

Heres the problem, the cables are more than likely stripped out where the 
crank gear is supposed to engage them.
Remove the crank from the roof and look up into the hole where it came out 
from, the cables should look like coil springs and the gear of the crank is 
supposed to catch the ridges of the cables and pull or push them along thus 
opening of closing the roof.
If the ridges are broken it is probably because the roof was too tight and 
needed cleaning and lubricating.
You will need to replace the cables and clean and lube the roof.
I have taken a two of these apart and it is possible to do without damaging 
the headliner, in fact there is nothing to gain from cutting the headliner.
Bring a friend with you to help when rebuilding.
New cables are $110 each and you will need 2.
I do have some for sale on the auction sight by the bay for much less and 
some other good roof parts that will go with them.
If you are going to rebuild the roof let me know and I will give you all the 
pointers I have.
