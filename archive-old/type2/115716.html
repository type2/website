&gt; Q1
&gt; I found 2 wires I didn't mark, they are the efi white wires, both come out of
&gt; the harness about 15cm away from the computer , and they have markings #40 ,
&gt; and
&gt; #12  on the wire?
&gt; What are they for,, I can't find them in the bentley diagram

Probably the ground wires for the harness. There is a multiple spaded
connector under the air plenum on the 3/4 side just below where the EGR
system attaches to the plenum.

&gt; Q2
&gt; I hope I didn't screw up the vacuum lines,, the large lines are straight
&gt; forward, the small lines I connected so that the air box and the distributor
&gt; are
&gt; connected to the throttle body.
&gt; The Decel and the fuel regulator are connected to the intake air distributor
&gt; Is that correct?

Check the image in my article:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/VacuumHoses.html
 
&gt; I set the hyd valves at 1.5 turns past tight
&gt; Dwell is 50 deg
&gt; timing is 7.5 Btdc
&gt; Vac is 17  and steady while it runs for 4 - 5 seconds
&gt; fuel pressure is 30-35 lbs
&gt; compression is 135 in all 4

That all sounds really good.
 
&gt; Q3
&gt; The CHT was 200 deg when I decided to tested the temp sensor II on the #3 cyl
&gt; head, It is about 250 ohms, and Bentley calls for 2500 ohms.

2500 Ohm at 68F.

&gt; I am not certain if I have a spare to try in its place.
&gt; Would the temp sensor have an effect on running?

It can but I think that value is fine. Again, check my article for the
specifics.
