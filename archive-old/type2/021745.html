Subject: Re: [T2] clutch question

Pat:
Nothing to do with the linkage.
Your clutch is not fully releasing. Bleed the slave cylinder. good time to bleed
out ALL the old fluid from the entire hydraulic system if you have not done so
in the last two years.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;      I was driving home in my 82 air-cooled westy.  I came to a light &amp; went
&gt; to downshift &amp; the thing would not go into 2nd. gear.  I finally got it to
&gt; go &amp; then it would not go into 1st. until I was almost stopped.  This got
&gt; worse as I got closer to home.  When I backed into the driveway it did not
&gt; want to go into reverse without grinding.
