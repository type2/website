&gt; What was the most popular/favorite color or color combination for the
&gt; transporter?

My guesses for Gemany, based on what I've seen around:

Splitty Transporter: Dove Blue.
Splitty Bus: Beige Grey over Sealing Wax Red.

Baywindow Transporter: first Neptune Blue, later maybe Taiga Green.
Baywindow Bus: White over Orange.
Baywindow Westy: Definitely Taiga Green.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
