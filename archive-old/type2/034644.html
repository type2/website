Subject: power loss, idle trouble [1600DP, Solex 30] [a little long]

Hi folks.

This problem started recently.  I've been out of town
and driven the bus little since mid-December, so I'm
not sure exactly when it came on, though it seemed to
be fairly sudden [say, within about one week/one tank of
gas].  I had trouble accessing this list for several 
days, so this report has grown with my trials and 
errors.

Original symptoms: Low power.  Low top end speed.  Warm 
idle speed abruptly switches between 900-600 or lower,
despite repeated readjustments to 850-900.  Nasty
backfiring. Suddenly deciding to die at stop lights--
sometimes. When it did die it was very hard to start,
and would only catch when I cranked and cranked with
the accelerator to the floor. [3-year-old battery is
sending me hate mail over this, as were the cars in
traffic behind me.]

What I've done so far: I checked and rechecked valves,
dwell, and timing, and checked carb settings. Valves 
and timing were due this week anyway--this is the new 
Mexican engine I got last summer.  

When I went over the carb, I found that the idle 
mixture adjustment screw was WAY off--don't know why, 
since a friend and I checked it out in October. [The 
carb is a Solex 30, with an adapter for the 34mm DP 
intake.] I also found and tightened a couple of loose 
exhaust clamps. After all this, I took it for a 4-5 
mile test drive, featuring up- and down-shifting and 
hills, and it seemed to be running fine.  Sounded and 
felt great--I figured the carb settings were the 
culprit.  Power okay [well, within reason, folks], 
acceleration okay, idle good, no backfiring.

About 3 hours later I took it on a run to someplace
about 10 miles away, and after about 2-3 miles it had
all the old bad symptoms again, except for backfiring:
low power, low top-end, low idle, death wish at stop
lights.

Pause two days here, while I wait for a break in the 
Oregon rain.  Today I replaced the points, plugs, and 
coil and checked all the ignition connections [working 
by myself, I couldn't test for a good spark from the 
coil so I swapped it out].  I went over the thing 
looking for vacuum leaks, found nothing that struck me 
as a problem.  

At the end of work today, it starts easily enough and 
will idle tolerably well but now it refuses to rev.  If 
I open the throttle fairly quickly, it coughs and will 
die if I don't let off the throttle again.  If I inch 
the RPMs up very slowly, I can get to about 1800 before 
it coughs and gives out.  Occasionally it takes a 
rhythm, cutting out, picking up, cutting out, picking 
up.  At 1800 RPMs that happens about one beat per 
second.

I'm stumped. Other than fixing the backfiring, I've 
made no progress and even lost some ground. What am I 
missing here?  Any suggestions would be very welcome.

Oh yeah--happy new year everyone!
