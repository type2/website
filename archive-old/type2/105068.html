Subject: Re: Engine bolt question

From: Faster-Laster &lt;jason_at_fasterlaster_dot_com&gt;

&gt;So the transmission has a notch where the bolt is so
&gt;that it keeps it still when I tighten it. Not a problem normally, but
&gt;in this case my bus has a 1600 DP engine in it. this engine has one of
&gt;those press in threaded bushings at that location.

Is the bolt head (transmission side) in good shape?  I've been able to get a 17mm socket on mine, with a u-joint and extensions to reach around the 
clutch cable/lever.  It *is* a PITA, but there was just enough room around the hex, or the hex was thick enough, to let the socket grab and turn it.  
Note that if you undo this bolt first and tighten it last you have the least load on it, making it easier to turn.

Or maybe you could use the Dremel to open up a little space around the hex for your socket?  Seems like this could be done without damaging the 
tranny case, and would save your bolt (and be easier than cutting the bolt, IMO).
