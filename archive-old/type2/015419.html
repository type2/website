Yes it can. A compression test must ALWAYS be done to determine the health
of the motor BEFORE addressing ignition and fuel systems. When diagnosis
any running problem, including milage issues, always verify mechanicals
first, ignition systems second and last, fuel delivery and mixture.
Guarenteed to waste the least amount of time/money.
