Re sprayable polyester filler.

&gt;What sort of a gun are you using to spray this stuff?
&gt;Just a regular suction gun or some sort of HVLP or pressure pot system


I'm using my oldest ugliest primer siphon gun, but I drilled out the fluid
tip to a fairly large size (hey you try to find needles and tips for a 10
year old taiwan gun)  not exactly sure how big off hand, basically drilled
it as big as it looked like I could, it puts the taper of the needle much
farther out the tip.  Works very nicely the stuff I used Z-Chrome Rust
Defender I think is the name is about 1.5-2 times as thick looking as
properly mixed acryllic enamel.  Like I said it does not get thinned either,
straight on.  It also goes on well even with the siphon gun, not much
overspray and not much orange peel, I must have lucked out on the modified
tip orfice size, the stuff is so heavy it just wants to go on the desired
panel, plus it does not dry quickly at all so overspray settles on and sinks
in.  Takes a good time for the surface to fully dry, I don't recall exactly
but a good couple (3+) of hours.  Mine is basically just polyester resin,
thinned with styrene I'd guess with a yellow pigment so you can see where
you've been.  In thinking about it again BTW I think I'd do a full pop-top
to about 180-220 dry before I sprayed, experimenting a little to make sure
the stuff will cover, but I'm fairly sure I've gone straight from 180 to
spray this, to 240 and 320 final sanding before using a heavier topcoat.

Oh as another general gun plug, I'm still 1000% satisfied with my gravity
cup Sharpe HVLP, has to be one of the best $150-$200 guns on the market, the
HVLP actually works (perhaps not so well as a full turbine system) and I
like the gravity cup and the balance of the gun a lot save for the fact the
cup is small.
