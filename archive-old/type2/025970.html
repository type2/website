Hey, what a great trip report, I might have to put that weekend on my trips
to take next summer!!  I hope Jaime repeats it.  Hey, I would love to get
your recipe for the cherries:)

It's good to hear about your smooth trip, sorry to hear you can't lick the
gas milege thing.  So many details go into the gas milege formula.  One that
gets overlooked is front end alignment.  With worn tie rod ends, the toe in
angle goes bad and so you are pushing the front end down the road, which
takes a bunch of gas to do so.  It might help, or at least I hope so.

Thanks for your report, it was good reading!

&gt; If there ever was a perfect vacation, this one was it. Went over Goldie, my
&gt; '71 Westy, with a fine tooth comb and, finding nothing drastically wrong,
&gt; left Cincinnati, Oh. on June 20,2001. Up I75 to Lakeside, Oh. to pick up my
&gt; wife who was staying at a family cottage. It's amazing the transformation
&gt; that comes over me when I leave for a road trip- seems like total relaxation
&gt; and a mellow mind-set. Left the next day for a trip around Lake Erie.

&gt; My hat is off to Jamie R. and crew for hosting a GREAT event.  Friday night
&gt; found us at a fantastic fire-works display over the falls.
