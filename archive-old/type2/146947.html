BD's site has worked well for me.  I'm not sure how big BD is, but I'm 
guessing they're a small shop.  You can't expect someone that isn't an 
amazon_dot_com to have the most pimped out site with excellent interface 
design.  It costs alot of money in programmers, research, and time to 
have a site that really flows.  That might not be BD, but at least he's 
got the parts out there on the internet available for everyone to browse 
through.

Everything's got a learning curve and that probably goes for the BD 
site.  But once you figure it out, you'll never have to learn it again. 
  Plus, now you know about the button ;)

enjoy,
Mike

&gt; Busdepot's website still confounds me.  Does everyone know to click on the
&gt; &quot;See all Parts&quot; button?
&gt; I was blowing it on that for sometime, also, you have to use the back button
&gt; all the time, I don't like the navigation.
