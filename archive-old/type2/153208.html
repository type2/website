&gt; wheres the bus content????????????????????


chai, you really seem to be upset with the loss of 
FMBC_dot_com Lashing out at people on all the sites. No need 
to jump on me about a thread here about football. You made 
your point that you dislike football on buscapades. My 
favorite football team won their first championship in 26 
years. I know you dislike football, BUT there are some 
volks who enjoy chatting about it. I saw two threads about 
the game here on type2. Did you scold them also?

It's an American past time. Just like the past time of 
VWs. I apologize if I broke any type2_dot_com rules. It's a 
once in a &quot;moon&quot; event. I apologize about being happy that 
my &quot;STEELERSBUS&quot; has something to be proud about.

BUT, if you need &quot;bus content????????????????????&quot;

Jerome THE BUS Bettis retired after giving us Steeler fans 
10 GREAT years of football. THE BUS was not only a great 
football player, but a even greater man off the field. 
Never once did THE BUS tarnish the image of the Steeler 
orginization. Always a respectful and upstanding guy. 
Great leader by example. Thank you BUS for the great 
memories.

Hope you cheer up soon.
