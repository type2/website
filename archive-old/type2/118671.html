Subject: RE: [T2] oh no tranny or clutch? &amp; thanks for info

My bet would be a CV joint. Cornering is usually where they fail. Cheaper
than a tranny, and you can do it yourself without dropping the
engine/tranny. Disassemble all four, the other three are probably on their
way out too. On reassembly, make sure you have the backing plates and
lockwashers under the bolts, and torque the bolts correctly. Then check them
visually for a few hundred miles. Ask me how I know.
