Subject: FS SoCal price reduced

As many of you know I will be leaving for Germany in three weeks.  The bus 
motor has taken a turn for the worse enabling someone to get a better deal.  
I am going to drop the price to $1000.00 to enable someone to spend the 
difference on the used motor I had lined up, The used motor is going for 
$600.00 with a 90 day warranty.  I have gotten emails regarding the joy of 
having it with me in Germany, but unless your in my shoes it would be hard to 
understand.  So here it is for more info give me a call or send an e-mail.
Peace Out
Rick
