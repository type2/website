&gt;    I've got a puzzler for you folks...  I've got a 78 Westy Champaign,
&gt;which runs (and looks:) great.  Problem is lately, getting it started.
&gt;    My bus does a lot of sitting over the winter months in my garage.  So a
&gt;couple of weeks ago, we I was ready to go camping, but Ben wouldn't start.
&gt;&quot;Battery's dead,&quot; I thought... no real surprise.  Charged it up and away we
&gt;went.  While camping, I played two CDs in the recently rewired stereo.
That
&gt;was the extent of my electrical useage.  The next morning, no go.  The
&gt;battery tries once, and almost a second time... then nothing.
&gt;    I looked in the Archives, and suspected a short.  Probably a problem in
&gt;my stereo wire-up job...But if that were the case, why did it hold a charge
&gt;nearly two weeks after we got home?  Does this sound familiar to anyone?
&gt;I'm no mechanic, but can get a grip on about anything with some direction.
&gt;TIA, gang.
&gt;
