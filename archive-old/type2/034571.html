Subject: greasing cv joints and starter maintenance

Hi folks,
   About 2 weeks ago I sent a post asking if anyone had ever modified a cv 
joint so it could be greased with a grease gun and without removal.  It was 
amazing how many of you p-mailed me, so let me respond to you all here.
   First , your replies had two basic themes.  One saying that the joints 
probably didn't need to be replaced and would continue to work even with 
pitting.  The second suggested opening the small end of the boot and using a 
long thin tube to inject grease into the joint.
   1.  I'm sure these joints would have continued to serve me well, as they 
only had light pitting.  But you know what, in over 20 years of driving 
buses I'd never even seen a new cv joint, so this was the time.
   2.  I was hoping to find a more positive means for the grease to get 
directly into the joint.  This long tube idea seems to be hit or miss, with 
no way to tell for sure.  But I will give it a try, maybe I'll be pleasantly 
surprised.
   It took a couple of weeks for me to get the job done, as I had the flu, 
shipping on the parts took longer because of the holidays, and I just didn't 
have the time.  So this past Sunday I finally got the shafts reinstalled and 
wanted to go for a drive.  Well, of course the starter wouldn't work.  
Turned the key and got that deafening silence.  At first I thought it might 
be the starter switch, but as I've learned over the years, it's usually the 
starter.  So out it came for a routine servicing.  We got this bus about 18 
months ago, and this was the first time I was removing the starter.  In our 
previous buses I've learned that you can beat the dreaded hot start problem 
by giving the starter routine attention once a year.  This was the first 
starter problem in about 15 years.  By making the starter a routine 
maintenance item, you get to deal with it where and when you want to, not 
when you have to.  Well monday morning the starter went back in and all is 
well with our unnamed, as of yet, 71 westy.
   If you would like to know what I do to service the starter, feel free to 
p-mail me and I'll tell ya.
