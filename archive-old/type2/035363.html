Subject: Re: Not enough advance from vac can?

&gt; Sound like a vacuum advance problem? I have done a suck test, and there
&gt; is motion transfered to the dizzy, but A) I don't know if it's enough and
&gt; B) I can't be sure (without a vacuum gauge on my dash) whether there's
&gt; enough vacuum.
Make sure that when you set your timing that the advance is fully retracted
and not gunked up. Happened to Phrogbus looong ago.

Hope this helps,
