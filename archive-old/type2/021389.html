Terry, Joe:
Good point, Terry! I've painted a few cars and thought the materials were
pretty expensive and I was just buying Ditzler/PPG, not the expensive foreign
brands. but I was never tempted to use another product, cause I'd not EXPECT
it to work.
Joe, if you really don't CARE what color, maybe you should check at auto
paint suppliers for mis-tints. I'd guess they mess up sometimes and have
products they can't sell to the intended buyer. Keep in mind, you may not be
able to match it, if it's truly a mistint. At this point, it basically has
become hazardous waste, so you'd think they might be able to sell it to you
for 1/3 to 1/2 the intended price. A friend of mine used to buy large lots of
industrial paint from S-W for $1 per gallon!
Another source would be body shops, who also might find extra paint on hand.

&gt; All paint, be it automotive, or house paint is actually oil
&gt; based.(excluding latex)
&gt; The only difference is, house paint lacks the flow characteristics, uv
&gt; inhibitors, and driers.
&gt;
&gt; If you go ahead and blow this SW, house paint on your bus, the tack-up
&gt; time is so long, you best have a vacuum chamber to have it dry in, for
&gt; if you don't, the bus will be so full of bugs and dust, it will look
&gt; like a &quot;Chea Pet.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Maybe K-tel, or who ever makes the Chea stuff, is missing the boat!
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps the Chea-Bus will be a new Christmas time fad !!
&gt;
&gt; Cool !!----Go for it !! :&gt;)
