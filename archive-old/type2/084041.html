Subject: free rear bumper/hitch combo


A heavy-duty rear bumper with trailer hitch engineered from heavy duty
steel.  Not the prettiest thing, but with some paint it could be made to
look decent.  This was on my bus ('74) when I got it, but I didn't need
or like it and so now it sits in the backyard holding down the firewood
tarp.  P-mail me for pic.

In Portland, Oregon; must be picked up.
