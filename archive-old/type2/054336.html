Subject: Injectors firing

I am surprised to hear that the injectors all fire at once. Back in the
'70's I worked in a VW shop and when we were diagnosing type III
injectors we would sometimes lay them on top of the engine and crank it
to see if they were firing, and they fire sequentially. There was a
dealy in the distributer I believe.  I guess the busses are different?
