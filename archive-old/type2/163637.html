&gt; That one is a perfect example of why I have a rule to never, ever, 
&gt; EVER bid on an auction item listed in ALL CAPS.
&gt;
   Or ever buying anything as expensive as a car without having
someone inspect the vehicle...A couple of years ago I was fol-
lowing the auction of a sports car that was being sold by a spec-
ialty dealer in Wash. D.C. area. The car was bought by a retired
couple in Maine that I contacted to tell them about the mailing
lists available for the car. They rented a trailer and drove down
to pick up the car...Whoops!! The car had been in a flood...There
was still water in the transmission and rust throughout the lower
half of the car. They got their deposit back but were out the time
and trailer rental... ;-(
