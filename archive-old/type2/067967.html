It probably means that you have a stuck lifter or need to do a valve
adjustment. Yes even hydros need an adjustment. But check the lifters
first. I had this same problem and flushed the engine and put in a thicker
oil and, well lets just say the engine is quieter. Hasn't had a noice yet.

&gt; (135 and 145 last check).  Engine history unknown [probably original
&gt; engine for this bus, with either 80K or 180K, and may or may not have
