Subject: Re: [T2] re: solar power fridge

David,

I apologize for the lack of attention I paid to units.  I wrote this 
quickly and had some other stuff on my mind.

When i said &quot;W/day&quot; i meant &quot;amp-hours/day&quot;.

Regarding &quot;parking in the sun&quot;, I whole heartedly agree.  Again, it 
depends on your application.  When I travel to Burning Man, we're camped 
out in the middle of a dry lakebed -- no shade in sight -- for 7-10 days.  
In this case, a solar powered refridgeration system works well.  

Similarly, if you're &quot;on the road&quot;, you're probably getting some 
additional charging while you travel -- be that to charge your depleted 
batteries or power your fridge which is running.  There was a trip back to 
San Diego from the Grand Canyon one memorial day that I would have 
*loved* to have a fridge on board for...and I was certainly getting 
plenty of sun.

Bottom line: the trick is to either design something robust in *most* 
applications or to pick a particular application and design towards it.  
Then you get to factor in the money part.  

happy friday!

      tom
