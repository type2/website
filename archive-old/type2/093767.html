Subject: Re: [T2] 73 vs. 75

Well a 75 &quot;Westie&quot; is just a 75 transporter with a camper kit installed; so most things will be interchangeable.
However these are things which I know will not interchange.
Steering column switches
sliding door (same size but different locking)
panel containing fuel filler
fuel filler cap.
probably heaps of others too.

The engines (assuming both type 4) and ancillary parts should be interchangeable but this will depend on what markets the transporters were originally prepared for.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; Is there any interchangability between a 73 transport and a 75 westy?  I have 
&gt; the opertunity to relieve a restorable bus from a friend in need, for a very 
&gt; reasonable $.  
&gt; but i don't want it if i can't at least use some of it for my westy.  Please 
&gt; let me know ASAP, I'm supposed to check out the bus soon.
