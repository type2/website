Subject: how to cut in for fuel gauge, bus

Mike Benthin posted directions on how to replace the fuel gauge sender
w/o removing the gas tank...

I thought I'd thrown in my $0.02-

Back in May, my 79 bus developed a hole in the gas tank.  I immediately 
panicked, and gave up on the bus, actually bought another VW...
but in the following weeks I learned how to remove the gas tank 
easily w/o removing the engine.  It was a great opportunity to 
replace any fuel line or vent tubing, check the filler neck, and
clean up the rest of the gas tank....I basically replaced everything 
except the tank itself and the sender...

Point here is that removing the tank is easy.  I could write up a procedure
if anyone need it.  I've done the procedure 3 times now, 3 differnt buses.
I think it is a better option that cutting the hole in the bus
although cutting the hole is much easier if all you're doing is replacing
the sender...
