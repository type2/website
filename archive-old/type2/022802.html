Subject: strange clutch change

--part1_4d.1025183c.28b1b264_boundary

I replaced my clutch cable about two months ago when I began having 
difficulty shifting. 

All of a sudden today the exact same problem returned. I have about 4 inches 
of freeplay in the peddle before I feel any resistance as I push it down and 
it is not fully disengaging the flywheel. 

Did the cable suddenly stretch or is there another problem?

Your thoughts
