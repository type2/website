Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Das Volkswagen Bulli: Fascist Tool or Commie
  Sin-Bin?

As these last few grains of Friday slip through the glass, I will add a
small comment on this thread, a comment which I composed while preparing my
bus for a road trip tomorrow.

In my experience I have come upon three principles of the human condition
that are so often applicable as to be, for all intents and purposes,
universal.

1) In matters corporate or political, when seeking the root motivations--
     Follow the Money!
2) Given a free choice, people will choose to act in a way the pains the
     least or pleasures the most. (This maxim must sometimes be interpreted
     rather broadly in certain situations, but it still usually applies.)
3) It is the purpose--the only purpose--of society to serve the individual.
When this gets turned around and the individual is reqired to serve the
society it is the beginning of a long, painful decline.

Just my $.02, and worth every penny!
