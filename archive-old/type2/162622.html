&gt; Mark is absolutely right about the Crane (formerly Allison) XR700 - it is a
&gt; far better unit than the Accu-Fire, Compu-Fire or Pertronix that has been
&gt; available.  The best reason people buy the these three Electronic Ignition
&gt; conversions are that they are CHEAP.  But that doesn't mean they're as good
&gt; or better.  I've used nothing but Allison/Crane XR700's since the early 70s
&gt; on most any VW I've converted with much better relaibility and results.


maybe I'm missing something on their website but all they say that they
will work with is the 009 dist, what about the stock vacuum units.  I have
looked at em and I hear you guys but before I plunk down that many bucks I
want to know it will work with the proper advance etc.  especially
important since I have an automatic which tends to be more sensitive to
those issues,  I had an 009 in it when I got it and it was horrible
finally found a decent stock dist and the difference was amazing, I don't
want to give up that to get the Crane
