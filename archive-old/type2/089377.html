Subject: [T2] troubling signs, and other questions (long)

&gt;This weekend I began my quest to remove the heads from
&gt;my 78 2.0 FI engine.  I believe the problem is a
&gt;burnt exhaust valve, 3 cylinders have compression of
&gt;120-130, 1 has 30.  I'm pretty sure this engine is
&gt;all original, never having been rebuilt.

&gt;There was a lot of sludge caked in the oil strainer cap, including
&gt;what looked like aluminum foil (*gulp*).  There were some fairly
&gt;large pieces and after arranging them I deduced that what I had was
&gt;remnants of an oil container seal, you could even still make out the
&gt;round impression of the rim of the oil container.  Also found was a
&gt;piece of blackened paper about the size of a quarter, I'm figuring
&gt;this is part of a gasket or the like.

&gt;Besides the above, I found a small ammount of what seemed to be brittle flakes
of metal, &gt;blackened from their time in the engine case.  A magnet did not
attract
&gt;said pieces, so I figure they are either pieces of my case of maybe some
&gt;burned pieces of afore mentioned tin foil.  Any guesses?

Not case. Bearings. ( My best guess from here :)
This engine needs to be disassembled for cleaning
and bearing replacement. AKA &quot;rebuild&quot;.( Sorry :).
Too much grit in the oil circuit for too long.
Improper oil changes, no maintenance history.
Want a peak? Pull one piston and remove a rod
thru the hole.Don't drop the bearing shells inside,
or chase them with a  magnet if you do.
