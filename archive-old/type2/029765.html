&gt; &gt; Hello list   The later style  is much better than the early ones.  The TOB  
&gt; &gt; clips will fall off.   There are super clips that have an eyelet loop that 
&gt; &gt; allowed you to wire the clip to the crosshaft, therefore keeping the TOB in 
&gt; &gt; place.
&gt; 
&gt; To use the later style you'd have to at least replace the cross shaft 
&gt; (plus later clutch components), yes?  Maybe even the whole bell housing.

You need to have the sleeve around the pilot shaft to use the late clutch.
You can use an early clutch on a late housing by swapping the fork, but
it's might hard to add the holes for the sleeve to an early housing!
 
&gt; I found some clips with a loop in my parts drawer and will be using 
&gt; them.  From now on I'm wiring things together!  George Lyle also 
&gt; suggested wiring the circlip that goes around the cross shaft next to 
&gt; the bushing.

To do this you have to grind a bit of relief in the washer next to the
bushing to accommodate the safety wire.  The reason that I do this is that
I had one come out once and it trashed the bearing, bent the fork, and
made me cuss a lot!
