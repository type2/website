Subject: FS in Fresno, Calif

In todays Fresno Bee:

63 21 window microbus, $6000/obo  559-307-1587

66 + 70 buses, both running. To good home ( sounds like a pet dog??) $3500
each/obo  559-222-1627

73 bus, clean, doesn't run, $750/obo  559-645-8534

Now you know as much as I do :)

[a 70 for $3500???, way too much around here]
