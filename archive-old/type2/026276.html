The lead makes the fuel/air mixture burn slower, which means that power
is delivered further into the stroke.  With the right tuning,
performance definitely goes up.  This is my (limited) understanding of
it.  Someone back me up ... George?

&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; Actually, performance should decrease. Reason being that higher
&gt; octane just means that they put stuff in it (lead, whatever) to make
&gt; it
&gt; harder to ignite -- so that it won't pre-ignite from higher
&gt; compression
&gt; ratios -- so ounce for ounce, there is less intrinsic power in higher
&gt; octane.
