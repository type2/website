Bill:

&gt;He says the mechanic found signs that
&gt;it had run hot somewhere along the
&gt;line--not overheated, he said, but hot all the same.

Sounds like the Master Wrench mechanic is also mechanico-psychic.  I
wonder why the mechanic himself couldn't/wouldn't talk to you.  You have
a right to expect them to make every effort to explain what is deemed
neccessary, and why.

&gt;The garage will give me a day or so to give them an answer.

How charitable of them.

Please, Bill, these people are talking down to you.  Even if you don't
want to get your own hands dirty, at least get the bus away from them
before they can &quot;induce&quot; some dis-incentive for you to do so, and get at
least a second opinion.
