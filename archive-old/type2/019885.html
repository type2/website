DO NOT USE ACETONE!!!!!  It is too strong and may melt things that do not
function properly when turned into a blob.  Even some electronic contact
cleaners are too harsh on some plastics.  I prefer to use rubbing alcohol
applied with qtips and an old tooth brush.

If you have to use a spray cleaner to get at the hard to reach places, first
remove all plastic knobs.  Apply some on a Q-tip and then test swab some
inconspicious places.  If the plastic doesn't melt or discolor, continue.  Don't
forget the dial is usually paint on glass.  This is easily stripped clean by
acetone.
