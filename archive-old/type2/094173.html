Subject: Buses By The Falls, June Jitterbug and home again

Hi Volks,

Just got in from unloading the bus. Perishables only, the other stuff will
wait until tomorrow. I am BEAT.

Our family had a WONDERFUL time at Buses By the Falls. The bus ran great, we
got there and back on a single tank of fuel even with the trailer behind us.
The weather was good, as the rain had the good sense to wait until after
dark before it came down.

Jamie Rivers organized a great bus tour along the Niagara Gorge,  and the
wine tasting was fun too. Doing the tour at Mid-day made a lot of sense,,
and we were very popular with the other tourists. Campark's staff and
facilities once again showed us their usual fine performance.

Adam Narraway and Co. built the suspense level to a fever pitch with their
late Saturday arrival in the maiden voyage of the Dad-e-Van (68 Westy). It
looked really good thanks to Adam's flaming decals and Heather's fine detail
with paint, panelling and upholstery.

At the Jitterbug I saw some neat new buses; there were more type2's than I
have ever seen at a show. Did anyone get a full count?. Eric Fischer helped
get the flyers out to promote the bejeebers out of Buses Of the Corn. Later
I caught up with Skinny (Tim Johnson) and Dave Ireland, whom I hadn't seen
for too long. 

Expect a fuller trip report including 8x10 colour photographs with circles
and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one will follow sometime
later this week.

THANKS JAMIE, RUTH, KIM &amp; VICKY RIVERS --- WE HAD A GREAT TIME!!!



Happy trails,
