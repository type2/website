Previously posted on the type2 list ..........

&quot;I know (through mutual friends) a man who runs a golf-cart factory.  Gotta 
remember to talk with him about electrifying my Microbus when I get settled
in 
my new home.  A range of 20 miles would suffice for grocery store runs :-))

Well, years ago I met a fellow bus driver who had converted a Vanagon to
electric drive.  The entire floor, behind the 2 front seats, was covered
with batteries and he only got a range of 30-35 miles.
