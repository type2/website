Sorry Andrew nothing yet. One person told us to look in a parts book but
they did not have the stripping that we need. Please let us know what you
find out.

Thanks,

&gt; I'm looking for the same stuff.  I'd be interested in knowing if you got
any
&gt; good answers.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where we could get the inch wide stripping that trims
out
&gt; &gt; the cabinets and the closet. We just got our 73 westy and all the
stripping
&gt; &gt; needs to be replaced.
