Subject: Re: [T2] more##_at_&quot;&quot;??-_+fuel injection

Hi Drew.

Just to make sure, is the 35 psi with the vacuum to the regulator 
disconnected? Is it 26 to 30 psi with the regulator working with vacuum?

&gt;Hello Friends,
&gt;More adventures in fuel injection on my '78 Westy which persists in going 
&gt;full rich and flooding.
&gt;
&gt;The givens:
&gt;1. New AVP motor
&gt;2. It runs fine and then will either not start and flood with fuel running 
&gt;out of the exhaust system or will die on the road with the same fuel 
&gt;running out.
&gt;3. I've checked everything according to the VW fuel injection manual.  
&gt;Including:
&gt;      A. the head temp sensor.  It' good.
&gt;      B. the cold start valve has been plumbed out
&gt;         of the system i.e. a hose takes the fuel
&gt;         around it.
&gt;      C. The air flow meter has been checked.  Both
&gt;         of the resistances are on spec.
&gt;      D. The fuel pressure is fine.  35lb.
&gt;      E. I tried another computer. Lent to me by a
&gt;         very generous list member.  It made no
&gt;         difference.
&gt;      F. I checked one injector and got a weak
&gt;         pulsing light.  This seems fine.
&gt;4.  I have driven it like this for about 500 miles
&gt;and it seems as if the good spells are getting fewer and shorter.
&gt;5.  Now the one possiblity is that one of these parts has failed 
&gt;intermittently and will test bad when the thing won't run, but I've tested 
&gt;this stuff repeatedly and haven't been able to find it.
&gt;6.  The local VW guru and the not so local VW dealer have tried to fix it 
&gt;and they haven't done anything I haven't done nor have they done it as well 
&gt;as I have.  They each missed things that I eventually found.
&gt;
&gt;I am out of ideas!  Any help would be very appreciated.  Most of the ideas 
&gt;that list members have suggested of course followed the VW manual.  Thanks. 
&gt;  One of the worse things about this whole business is that this is the 
&gt;best looking and running (before) Westies I have ever seen.  It hasn't been 
&gt;all hacked up.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance (again) for any suggestions.
&gt;
&gt;Drew
