Subject: 71 windshield resto

Spent a couple of hours on the lower lip of the windshield frame this
weekend while Hurricane Georges slid by to the south and west of me
(whew!).

Nothing spectacular to report -- there were half-dozen dime-sized holes
and a bunch of pitting and smaller holes.  I used bondo and windowscreen
material and the results are pretty solid.  Some finish sanding left.

BTW this is a perfect time to repaint the dash top!
