Subject: Re: [T2] Bus won't move (still)

Maybe a little more info...

I have dealt with stuck drums before. The bus *tries* to move forward in 
while supposedly in any forward gear. It tries to move forward while 
supposedly in reverse. It tries to move forward when it's supposedly in 
neutral and I let off the clutch.
