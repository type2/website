Subject: FOR SALE: 1.7 liter engine rebuild kit (TYP IV)

1.7 liter engine rebuild kit. Purchased from Engine Builders Supply (Sparks, 
NV). It is the top end rebuilding kit with the VITON upgrade $147.15 value.

It contains:

piston ring set
engine gasket set
I/E valve guides
crankshaft seal
pulley seal
pushrod tube seals (VITON)

I sold my 914 years ago, and came across this in my storage. I opened the 
box for the first time last week. If you need other information contact me.

Asking $70.00 (Money Order or CASH please) shipping and insurance is
included. PLEASE TAKE THIS OFF MY HANDS... IT'S 50% REDUCED AND NICE TO HAVE 
AROUND FOR SPARE PARTS (I don't believe you can even get the VITONS for 
that... plus shipping)

PS... I am overseas, but use the USPS, or if going elsewhere I will contact 
you for the best shipping to you.
