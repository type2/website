&gt;How do i find the culpret?

Disconnect the ground cable from the battery, and use a multimeter to 
check the current draw from the battery. Start at the high scale (10 or 
20 amps on most meters), and work your way down until you get a 
reading.

Most multimeters have to have the leads plugged in differently when 
measuring voltage vs. current (amps). Make sure you move the leads back 
to the voltage position when all done measuring current. Otherwise, 
you'll effectively &quot;short out&quot; something if you try to measure voltage.

Something like a radio (turned off, current to keep station memory, 
etc.) will draw on the order of 10 mA, which isn't enough to drain a 
battery in a short time. If your battery is draining overnight, or even 
over a couple of days, expect something in the 1 amp + range. Even a 1 
amp draw won't discharge a good battery overnight (a good battery 
should be able to provide on the order of 100 amp-hours).

So, if you don't see a draw of over an amp, suspect a bad battery. (I'd 
expect well under 100mA with a radio and clock).

If you do see a significant draw, reconnect the battery, take out all 
the fuses, and check the current draw through each fused circuit. That 
will help narrow down what's drawing the power.
