&gt;seems this vehicle is running out of gas much too quickly...
&gt; when starting, it is flooded. You have to crank it a bit
&gt;before it will ignite, and then let it run for a minute
&gt;before pressing on accelerator (if you press it too soon,
&gt;you flood it and it stalls)

I've seen that problem as well. I remember the owner's manual recommend the use of the pedal as you start the engine. After the engine starts you have to be careful to feather the pedal otherwise it will lean out of die unless the fuel supply is good.

&gt; Dual Solex carbs. carb on left side has a ?solenoid? that
&gt;is loose. This causes vacuum leak and I believe is the
&gt;source of the starting problems (IE, gas leaks into cylinders
&gt;when engine is off).

They tend to come undone. Clean the threads with a brass brush and use a small drop of green loctite to keep them from coming loose again.

&gt; Anyone have good diagrams of solex carb? It looks like
&gt;this solenoid is threaded into the carb, and perhaps the
&gt;threads are stripped.

Yes, they are threaded.

I have a few photos:
