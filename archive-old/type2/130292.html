Subject: RE: [T2] FI harness repair

&gt;- do nothing and wonder why the FI is acting up in a few years like the
D-Jet folks

Or you can do like the SMART D-Jet folks do and replace the 30+ year old
harness with a NEW one from Jeff Bowlsby.

http://members.rennlist_dot_com/914_wiring_harnesses/

I bought one for my 74 914 2.0 last fall after two of the FI connectors
litterally snapped off in my hands.  I can tell you from first-hand
experience that this replacement harness is a top-notch piece of work.  The
quality was so perfect that this could have passed for a new factory
harness!  If you L-Jet folks are lucky Jeff will find a big enough market to
justify building the harnesses for the 1.8 motors since these should be an
exact match for the bus harnesses.

Jeff is a super-nice guy and always seems to have time to talk.  So if
there's enough of you willing to pony up the $380 for a new harness that
will not give you any trouble for many many years to come, maybe you can
talk him into it.
