Subject: snapon torque wrenches

If you've noticed that snapon has changed a lot of it's torque wrenches in the latest catalog it's because they tried to buy the company that made them a while back and they had a falling out in the process. Snapon are making many of their own now and if you liked some of those older styles you are limited to the stock in the warehouse until it runs out.

I've since found out who made them for snapon and you can still get them from the mfgr and through their distributors:

Precision Instruments

The prices are better too ($100 less on the ones I've been looking at). Snapon only gave a 1-yr warranty so they were really charging a hefty premium.
