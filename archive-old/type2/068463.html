Subject: Re: JCW Engine Stands?

I haven't purchased a stand yet, but I spoke to a vendor at the Woodstock,
NY VW show a few months ago about these bench mount stands (JCW offers them
on sale for as little as $22 and you can pick them up at the meets for $20).
He told me that the cheaper versions bend under the wieght of a fully
assembled engine.  He did mention that there are German versions of the
bench mount that are made of thicker steel and they work very well but are
more expensive.  This was the first time I  heard a distinction made on
these between German/nonGerman or thicker/thinner--apparently there might be
different quality models out there to choose from.  I suppose you could buy
the $20 one and weld some reinforcements to it or don't mount a fully
assembled engine to it.  I guess this is just another example of getting
what you pay for.
