Subject: [T2] quick help!

hey.

    In my 77 2000  fi, on the passenger side of the firewall, there is a
silver box.  It is not the double relay.  The wires for it seem to come
from the alternator.

    Help me out and tell me what it is, a bit of what it does, and
perhaps why the brown wire coming from it is burned.

    Thanks,
