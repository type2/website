Subject: Fuel line question

Volks,

I am playing with the vanagon trying to clear up some problems in the
electronic ignition (more on that later) when I notice the FI hose at the
cold start valve is wet all of a sudden.  I am certain it was dry when I
started.  Drat!  Must have bumped it or something.  I want to replace it
so I go looking thru my bundle of spare hoses and see nothing that says
flat out &quot;this is FI rated&quot;  I do see a length of something that *looks*
FI rated, but won't put it in 'til I am sure.

The markings on this length of hose are:

VW TL 5225 E 7x3 K DK 3/41/96 VRT

&gt;NBR&lt; &gt;CR&lt;

These repeat on opposite sides of the hose.  Can someone out there confirm
that this is FI rated?  or NOT FI rated?  I would head for the store, but
it's Sunday morning and the only store that is a walk will have only
'5/16&quot; and 7/16&quot; oh, sure it's FI'  hose.

                           Steve Dolan
