Subject: [T2] Brake Drum Puller

&gt; After much WD-40 and liquid-wrench, I was able to get the rear star to
move and
&gt;backed the shoe away from the drum as far as I could. However I could not
&gt;get the other start to move at all,

Apply more WD-40 through the other ovalized adjustment hole,then apply a
large
screwdriver or adjustment flat head and/or 5 pound sledgehammer,
remembering
that this second star loosens in the opposite direction of the one which
came loose.
the hammer comes into play when the hole is too ovalized for the
screwdriver to get
any leverage. Figure out which way the star loosens by visualizing the shoe
setup
through the backing plate (like superman) then spray/whack spray/whack -
but don't
kill the stars. apply control and patience.

&gt;So I searched through the archives about this issue and came up with
&gt;several references to hitting it with a hammer and using a brake
&gt;drum puller.

Does the 77 have composite drums? Can't you loosen the 2 12mm bolts on the
face of
the drum and separate it from the hub? if you can, do that, then use your
hammer to
gently tap it off, making sure you're ready to catch it before it lands on
your ankles.
if your drum is one piece then you need to run down to Sears and get the
craftsman
'2 arm puller' which isn't the best but is adequate to pull the drum and
relatively
available - runs about $30
