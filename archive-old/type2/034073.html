Subject: Carb blowers..will this work ?

(taken from another board)
&lt;&lt;More total air through the motor is what makes more power, just a cam
change doesn't add much !! &gt;&gt;


I've been wondering about doing something. I have a really strong heater
blower motor that I was wondering what would happen if I mounted it on
top of my single 2 bbl Weber carb and drove with it on.

Crazy ..... but will it work ?

What do 'ya think ?
