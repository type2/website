Subject: My bus let me down . . .

My bus let me down today - it broke down away from home and I had to call a
friend to pull me home.  It was very sad.As a result though, I'm going to
finally fix the broken ignition switch that was on its way out, fix the broken
contact on the automatic choke, and fix the gas gauge.What happened was a
strange confluence of events. I was on my way to the FLAPS to buy a new relay
for my Hyundai! when I ran out of gas.  I ran out of gas b/c I wasn't paying
attention to my mileage (my gauge is broken somehow).  When I was able to put
a gallon of gas in the bus, it was of course dry so it took a few tries to get
all the fuel running smoothly.  However, I've had my chokes disconnected and
one of the wires fell onto a ground.  Well I shouldn't have had a hot wire
back there flopping around anyway, right?  So, what I'm speculating is that
the grounded out wire fried my ignition swith - it doesn't seem like it should
have - it seems like a fuse should have blown first - but the ignition switch
remains dead. It doesn't turn at all.  So either I fried it or it just chose
this moment to break.Sometimes the day just doesn't go your way.On the plus
side, now I know how to hotwire my bus - it's disturbingly easy.-adam'78
