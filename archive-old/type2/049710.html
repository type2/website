Subject: [T2] oil leak in 79 bus

My 79 bus has a major oil leak that appears to come from above the oil
filter.  I drained the oil and removed the filter and the only thing that
looks abnormal is a hole (maybe 1/2&quot; in diameter ) that looks like it should
have a flat plug (I also have a 77 bus and I compared the two and the 77
appears to have this hole plugged up).    This hole is directly above (about
4-5&quot; above) the oil pressure relief valve and it seems to be in the
crankcase itself.   I only know a little about cars so I'm not sure I'm
calling things by their proper names.   This hole is also next to a 17mm
nut, if that helps.   The oil filter bracket seems to be installed properly,
as does the oil cooler.    I would like to know if I should put oil and
filter back in and test it or does this sound like there is some plug or
bolt missing above the oil filter?    Thanks so much for any help.      Mimi
