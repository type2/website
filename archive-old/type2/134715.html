Subject: RE: [T2] Which year bus for resto.

&gt; I have had 69, 71, 74 and 79 buses and HIGHLY
&gt; reccomend a 76 or later bus if you plan to drive it
&gt; a lot and use it as a regular camper.

I must concur, also having owned several. 1971 is probably the best of the
bug-engined bay-window busses (thanks to its servo assisted disk brakes and
dual port engine), and is what I'd look for if I wanted the simplicity of a
Type 1 engine. But I still prefer the Type 4 engine myself, especially in
1.8 to 2.0 liter configurations. (The 1.7L offered a minimal performance
improvement over the bug engine, with added parts cost.) In its later
incarnations, the Type 4 engine is noticably more powerful in stock
configuration, and you don't overheat your engine if your V-belt fails. Of
course there's that pesky valve seat design flaw, but it's nothing a pair of
AVP heads (which we sell) won't fix.  Coupled with a superior camper layout
(the '76-up Westy has largely the same interior layout that continued all
the way through the Eurovan camper), this has made the '76-up my favorite
Westfalia.

&gt; fuel injection is more dependable

This actually began in '75 (or more accurately, late in '74), not in '76.

&gt; hydraulic lifters that do not require frequent valve adjustments

Only on '78 and '79.

&gt; engine access is much better with removeable top hatch

This began in '73.

&gt; they have disk brakes

This began in '71.

&gt; and the camper packages offer a full double bed above
&gt;  along with a more practical floor plan down below.

The double bed up top began in '74, although the &quot;ground floor&quot; layout was
improved in '76 (at the expense of passenger seating).

You can find a rundown of the most significant model-year changes, and a
general buyer's guide, on my Links &amp; Resources Page:
