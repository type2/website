Subject: Type III motor in late model Bay

Hello Listees,

You can call this &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;, &quot;having a brain fart&quot;, =
&quot;inquiring minds want to know&quot;  or &quot;what the h*ll has he been smoking&quot; =
but has anyone ever tried to put a type III motor in a late model bay =
that was designed for the type IV motor?  OK, when you catch your breath =
from laughing so hard, hear me out.  First of all, I'm not a newbie on =
the list, but I have been lying low for a while.  I have a '72 bus that =
I am going to put my carefully built 1600 DP in.  I have the correct =
engine tin from Just Campers over in the UK including the rear &quot;bearer =
bar&quot; so that I can do a proper installation.  This was a common option =
in Europe where petrol is much more expensive.  I want to to it because =
it's the only engine I have as the '72 came sans motor.  Also, I built =
this engine very carefully and it only has 17K miles on it and it runs =
like a champ, so I want to see how it lives out its life.

But back to my question.  With the new aluminum type I cases out there =
(universal case??), I was thinking that the type III configuration is =
similar to the type IV and that it might just fit.  You could stroke it =
and easily build a 2 liter engine that is very reliable if you don't get =
carried away.  Parts should be cheaper than for a type IV motor unless =
the stroker crank and bigger pistons negates the type I cost advantage.  =
Possibly no one has done this because the sheet metal would have to be =
improvised a little, possibly because type III motors are less common or =
possibly no one has thought of it.  Another advantage of a type III =
motor over the type I would be easier access in the engine compartment.

Maybe I have already answered my question, but I'd like to hear some =
discussion on the subject.  My flamesuit is on and zipped up tight!! ;-)
