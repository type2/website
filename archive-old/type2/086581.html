Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning West roof (further to...)

I had a new headliner put in my 77 Westy by a convertable shop and they
charged $75 bucks. They put it on over the old material.

Convertables Only in Seattle did the job.

&gt; Folks, for what it's worth:
&gt;
&gt; I recently bought a gorgeous Volvo 765 with nary a problem but a sagging
&gt; headliner.  I took it to a local
&gt; Headliners Plus! guy, and was consequently so impressed with his work and
&gt; rates, I went home, drove
&gt; my 78 Westy back to him, and asked what he could do about that godforsaken
&gt; mildew stain on the
&gt; &quot;fuzzy&quot; crap that lines the inside of the poptop. (I had, by that point,
&gt; spent egregious amounts of money
&gt; on surely every commercially-available product... and nearly killed myself
&gt; in the process a number of times:
&gt; fumes tend to congregate up there!)
&gt;
&gt; Well, he takes a gander, and in the end, for a mere $250, he installed a
&gt; &quot;marine-grade&quot; headliner, a nice
&gt; comfy kinda stuff, PADDED mind you, and (here's the kicker) applied 3/4&quot;
oak
&gt; strips all the way around
&gt; the inside of the poptop - to which he re-stapled the canvas (which was
&gt; sagging on one side) and screwed
&gt; them into the fiberglass.
&gt;
&gt; It looks incredible - and is surely the one-thing-I-didn't-do-myself of
&gt; which I am the proudest! I highly
&gt; encourage other folks to investigate similar options, if $250 is
reasonable
&gt; for them.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers!
&gt;
