Subject: Intake Seals, Where to get them

Hello All

I have a 72 westy with the complete stock air filter system.  Metal
circular oil bath with two arms (air cleaner ducts) going to the carbs.
Well It has little rubber seals that go between the oil bath assembly
and the air cleaner ducts which go to the carbs.  They are about 1.5&quot;
wide and go completely around.. Well mine are there but almost
completely ripped through

Where can I get new ones.  I have looked everywhere I can thinks of and
seen them no where, or maybe I don't know what there called.  With out
these my carbs will begin sucking nice dirty air.

Any Help is appreciated
