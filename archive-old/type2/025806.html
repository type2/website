&gt; Well PADME made her first trip to Bug-o-rama this saturday. She made it
&gt; there fine and loved seeing her family. However on the way home she started
&gt; stalling out when she was supposed to idle, as long as I was giving her some
&gt; gas then she stayed running however everytime I let off the gas even to stop
&gt; she stalled. anyone seen this? any ideas where I can start troubleshooting
&gt; this error?

Set the valves, set point gap (with a dwell meter), set timing. It doesn't
make sense that these would matter, but they help.
