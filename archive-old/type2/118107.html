&lt;&lt; Is 200,000+ miles all that unusual?

I still have the original motor in the bus that used to be my

fathers, and it was very close to 300,000 before it threw a rod.

It's been rebuilt since, but it always used to just keep going and

going. &gt;&gt;

I suspect it's the infinite monkey theory...Given the number of
engines turned out by VW, a few are gonna be pretty close to
perfect (and a few are gonna be DOA)...It's a bell curve kinda
thing with most engines in the middle...
