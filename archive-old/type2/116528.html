Subject: Part number match/ compatabilty(3)

&gt;I was thinking more in terms of the fuel pressure
&gt;regulator, also a very expensive item, btw..

Junkyard baby! Might be a little more worried about drying out here as the unit does see fuel, although it would be seperated from the vacuum system. Think about it, mixing fuel and air is dangerous, that's why it only happens on the way to the cylinders.

&gt;but it appears that most of the
&gt;parts on this system are.

Theory of relativity. To a carb rebuilding type1 person yes, but you've got to savor passing trucks, getting to 7500' in the sierra nevada with a load of people in third gear....

&gt;I just bought a new oxygen sensor (Bosch) for
&gt;about $30.00, and that is probably one of the least &gt;expensive components on the system. I guess that &gt;they're only good for about 30K miles.

Maybe less. Had mine replaced about 10,000 miles ago, failed california smog in the department that the 02 sensor relates to. (final oxygen content?)

&gt;Hey! If a used part might work, then go for it.

Just not O2 sensors.

Billy
