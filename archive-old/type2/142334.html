Subject: Re: [T2] what yr is this engine?

Hey Guys  This is  a case where a pix would be worth a thousand words.   I 
suspect that it is a reman factory case  but I could tell more by seeing the 
head studs, oil pump studs, engine number and bottom of the case.   Small head 
studs came out in 72, &amp;1 for dual relief  valves, and big oil pick up.  oil pump 
studs changed in 68   Some of the reman factory cases had a vw eleblem with 
arrows going aroung the VW  later  mark Dearing
