Subject: 69 bus for sale NE Iowa

List:
Got a call today from a fellow who needs to get rid of his 69 bus. It's
red with a white top and apparently has a gas heater. His name is Dave
Peterson and he's at 319-422-3241 and that's in West Union, Iowa. The
bus is in a nearby town. He said it allegedly had a bigger motor in it,
1700, he thinks, but is quite certain it is a 69. I guess it could have
a big bore kit- 88's would make it pretty close to 1700. It's got rust
all the way around the bottom, but he says the sliding door still works
fine.
He claims it has a documented 76k original miles. It drives really
nicely. He lost his license and needs to get rid of it. He paid $550 for
it and is resigned to taking somewhat less. He is going to send me some
pictures, in about a week.
If you're in the market for such a vehicle, this is a possibility of a
good deal. And a nice place to visit in the spring. (Lots of woods and
trout streams, and canoeing, etc.) A lot different than the rest of Iowa
that most people see when crossing on I-80!
Now you know everything I do.
