&gt;It's got a recently rebuilt 1982 914 motor, guy we bought it from claims to
&gt;be getting 22 mpg.

They made the 914 from 1970 to 1976. What do you have, and is it FI
or carb(s) and what kind ?

&gt;Heater and defrost work well.
Consider yourself very lucky. And is it warm where you live ?

&gt;Only major immediate thing to fix, is the rear &quot;sags&quot; about 3-4 inches lower
&gt;than the front.
&gt;
&gt;How do we fix that?
Read the Bentley manual chapter about torsion bar adjustment. Then read it again.
Basically, you have to respline those bars to raise the bus, it's not that hard but it
requires some careful manipulation.
