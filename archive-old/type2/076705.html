Subject: Re: [T2] Snake oil cooling info???

I feel that a filter on the suction side is a really BAD idea. The most
pressure you can have on the suction side of the pump is 14.7psi (remember,
atmospheric pressure is PUSHING the oil up the PU tube), and this is even
lower as elevation increases. Add a restriction like a filter (another
pressure drop) and you are asking for it, IMO.

A small pressure drop like 3-5psi is no big deal on the pressure side,
because we have somewhere between 20-60psi over there. If you have 15psi
pushing the oil, what happens when you drop this to say, 10-12psi? How much
margin for error is there? (I don't know)

In addition, any filter on the suction side is much smaller (more pressure
drop, more restriction) than on the pressure side because of the room
available.

Just my opinions.
