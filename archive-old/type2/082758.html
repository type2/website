Subject: For sale cheap:  84 wasserleaker sunroofer

We'll I've been driving the vanagon, and admiring
how well it drove.  Much tighter and a generally
better ride than my 74.  Then it happened.  My
vanagon started peeing.  Looks like right head,
though I'll crawl up underneath to ensure its not
one of the hose clamps on that head.  I expect to
be the head.  This thing has done everything
possible to ensure I cannot sell it.  It usually
runs fine until I post a for sale ad to the list
or talk to the paper.   (I've only advertised it
once in the approximately two years that I've
been thinking of selling it.)

If any of you bus-lovers are not afraid of doing
the head gasket yourself, pmail me.  

I just cannot keep up with all the maintenanc on
my fleet.  

Peace and blessings,
Ray
