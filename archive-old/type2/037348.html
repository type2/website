This is a nice tent....not new, but in real good (use it and enjoy it)
shape...no holes or canvas repairs...poles are all in good shape...two
have been repaired professionally...some top loops have been replaced
along with the front zipper..once again done professionally (cost me
$100 two years ago)

My grandchildren love camping out in the tent, but I don't really need
more than one...I have two.

I have $250(US$) invested here...make me an offer..._dot_can be taken to
Everybus with a deposit...

Den.
