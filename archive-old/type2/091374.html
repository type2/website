often with carbs than
FI, and never had to hike out with a bus FI.

&gt;once you get it right, it just keeps going and going
and going.  it is a PITA to learn to think differently
and to actually have to learn to  read instruments and
follow the manual but it is no harder than a single
carb and far far far easier than dual carbs.

Ditto!!!

I just converted my 72 westy over to a 76 drive train.
It WAS a PITA to go through the shack-down process,
but OH BOY! do I now LOVE  passing people when I drive
UP hill!!! LOL!

I had both single and origninal duel carbs in my bus
and I'm NOT going back! So it takes a bit more brain
power to fix, but it's oh so nice to drive and more
power!!! I'm glad I stuck with it (put all junk yard
parts in for the FI parts and well, a new Fuel Pump
and a few other misc. parts later...)

But I'm a happy camper literally with my 76 Westy
outwardly diguised as a 72!!!
There's my $.02!

Vroooom
