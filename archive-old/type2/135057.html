Subject: Re: [T2] More vac dizzy fun on 71 1600 dp...

&gt;1.  I haven't adjusted points in 10 years
&gt;2.  I don't own a timing light (yet)

I'm bitting my tounge so hard its bleeding.

Don't worry about advance or brake vacuum for that matter until you get the 
timing set spot on.

That's

point, dwell, gap what ever you want to call it (preff dwell with an 
electronic gagit)
then set it on the mark (tiiming that is with a light)
adjust your idle and repeat as necc

this is not dinner theater, they do all work well together and it is very 
necc that they be on the same stage so to speak

the port for the brakes is on the neck of the intake manifold just under the 
carb, yes up and to the left as you noted
