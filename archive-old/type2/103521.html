&gt;Got a call from an acquaintance telling me he would not be able to visit

&gt;He had to turn around and go back to get it. He got it reattached but it is 
&gt;not it's old self.
&gt;
&gt;So just a reminder to double check those latches!!!

I've never it put it to the test but I have a short cord wrapped around the push-up handle and the locking knob.

The other day I saw a 68-73 style camper going down I-280 and the poptop had become partially detached at the front and was surfing the wind. I tried to let the driver know there was something wrong but he ignored me thinking I must have been some kind of looney.
