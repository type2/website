For those of you rebuilding you engine; Took my new engine case to the
local speed machine shop today.  I was really having a hard time
removing the cosmoline.  They used a process called Jet Wash.  Basically
a big dishwasher.  Water based; no harsh solvents or chemicals.  Worked
like a charm. It even cleaned the oil passages! $10. Sure beats the 3+
hours I already spent trying to get it off with a tooth brush and
kerosene.
