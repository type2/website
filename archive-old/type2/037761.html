Bussers,
It's time to make some space in the barn.
For Sale:
1970 Pop-top Westfalia Camper.  Could conceivably be made roadworthy, has
clear title, but because of condition of body is best considered a parts
donor.  Pop top is in good shape, canvas is OK.  Upper cot and kid's hammock
all there.  Sink/icebox, shelf above bed, table, all but the stool are
there.  All glass, bumpers, step that goes into jack holes included.  Engine
is out but the running 1600 SP with decent compression goes with it.  1971
front axle beam with corresponding rear spindles.  On four wheels with good
rubber.  I'd rather let the whole bus go but will consider parting it out if
I have no takers.  $500.  P-mail me with any questions.
