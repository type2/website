&gt;Message-ID: &lt;1079824889.4d09cf89eadd4_at_secure.ip-solutions_dot_net&gt;

&gt;Hi Everyone,

&gt;I just purchased a new (Brazilian) Master Cylinder for my '79 Transporter.
I'
&gt;just it hooked back up to the vacuum servo and have the reservoir in place.
&gt;
&gt;My problem is in trying to hook back up the brake lines to the cylinder.
The
&gt;couplings on the brake lines don't seem to want to screw into the master
&gt;cylinder at all.


Hello,

It is very difficult to attach the brake fittings to a master cylinder.

the problem is that all the brake lines may not be aimed at exactly the
exact angle as they were on the original master cylinder.

To make it easier, do not attach the master cylinder to the booster. Let the
master cylinder hang freely in the air and attach one line at a time. Do not
completely screw in the barrel nut tight, just get it threaded far enough to
know that it is not cross threaded. With a free hanging master cylinder you
can move the master cylinder in three axis direction to match the angle of
the brake line to the master cylinder threaded hole. Attach all the lines
loosly until you have all the lines attached, then attach  the master
cylinder to the booster, then tighten all the brake lines.

It makes things a lot easier if you use high quality special flare nut
wrenches on the barrel nuts. An ordinary open end wrench will round the
edges of the nuts and ruin them. A good quality flare nut wrench looks like
a six sided box end wrench with a tiny opening cut in it to slip the wrench
over the brake line. This kind of wrench really has a good grip on the nut.

good luck

bye
