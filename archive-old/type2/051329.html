Subject: [T2] RE: Transmission filling hole bolt

Do you have the right tool?  My hex socket that I bought from my VW FLAPS
fits very snuggly in the hole and I can't imagine a filler plug being
rounded off so much that it wouldn't work, especially if you clean out the
hole and seat the hex socket fully into it.  Are there any burrs, or grease
preventing the tool from being fully seated?

&gt; Try getting a Dremyl tool with a cutting disk and creating little slots
&gt; all around the inside edge of the hole in the plug.  You can also drill
&gt; very short holes all around.  Cut a 1/2&quot; bolt short so the cut part fits
&gt; within the hole and lets the hex head stick out. Creat flats on the 1/2&quot;
&gt; threaded part using a grinding stone.  Use JB weld (the 5 minute stuff
&gt; to glue the bolt within the hole.  If it wants to run out, put tape over
&gt; it to hold it there until set.  Since this has to resist torque, the
&gt; holes and the flats are to keep it from spinning in the hole and
&gt; gripping well. Use an ordinary socket to twist the plug out!  MB  78

&gt; &gt; Hope this makes sense.  I went to change the transmission oil on my bus
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; noticed that the filling hole bolt was stripped(the head of the bolt
&gt; where
&gt; &gt; the allen key goes).
