Hi volks
You can get &quot;dual -purpose&quot; leisure batteries suitable for running camping
equipment but also starting you engine- they are sold as leisure batteries
form 60 amp to 130 amp I think. I have a Hella relay connecting a 80 Amp dual
purpose now for about 6 months and seems OK. Do get a very dim light at night
on gen warning if I have lights and wipers on together but thats the only
time. I have details if you want ...
