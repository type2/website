Subject: Back from Costa Rica

Hi all,

We are back from our jaunt to the jungle... 

Saw hundreds of ACVW's so many busses that we couldnt take pictures of em
all...

Quite a few Brazillian 15 window baywindows were spotted (15 window back
with a baywindow nose)

Almost got run over by a splitty kombi... (narrow road both of us going
well over 40.... close call)

I'll probably be HTML'izing a lot of the pictures soon... hope to see some
of y'all at the junebug jamboree next weekend.

Its nice to see the world but its good to be back too :)

Take care,

Steve

P.S. Costa Rica is the second most dangerous place to drive in the world!
whats the worst? why the USA of course...
