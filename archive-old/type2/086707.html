Subject: Re: [T2] tight front end


How tight is that steering box been adjusted? I would double check that
first.

I'm at a loss as to what's causing the front end on my 74 SC to be
tight.  All ball joints have been replaced, new drag link, new tie rods,
re-bushed relay lever, steering box adjusted....when all apart it seems to
be fine and loose.  The truck is at the shop today and they have now put on

a second set of new ball joints and the service manager just called me and
said it still seems tight.  Are we missing something here?  bottom line is:

truck will not return to center after rounding corners even at 55-60 mph.
