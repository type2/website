 &gt;Cleaned all contacts, and still couldn't get consistent readings, or
consistent spark.

Including the big connection on the solenoid that supplies power to 
the front (which is then fed back to the coil, etc)? This is a bit of 
a linchpin in the electrical system and tends to pick up a fair 
amount of road grime.

 &gt;We then took a direct line off of the battery to the coil,
and we were able to achieve consistent spark and get her to fire over (with
starter fluid).

Sounds like the connection I referred to above or the ignition switch.

Cheers,

Martin.
