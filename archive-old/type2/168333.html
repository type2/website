&gt; No starting fluid necessary, but for a fuel injected engine it seems to

This
&gt; is the way it's been since I've known her. Maybe I'm just used to modern FI
&gt; that fires almost immediately.

My understanding is that regardless of the year, with FI, you should never
even have to touch the peddle to start it. I had the same problem with Zoey
and came to find out that vacuum leaks were causing the hard starts.

Since I got my major leaks taken care of (S-Boot, AAR Boot, Brake Booster
Boot and various small vacuum line) zoey will start in 20 degrees as well as
my Civic. The only issues I have now are that she runs like crap since she
needs a tune job.

If you have to pump the gas in a FI, things are not right. With carbs, you
will have to pump - sometimes, but not with FI.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
