Well, Hey!

Michele and I are back, and, I most happily add, Edward (Birdeater) the Teal 
Tortoise is as well, and mostly intact.  Having never experienced a Westy on the 
long road before, we both find that it is as much fun (very likely more) than we 
thought.

&gt;From home, (near Santa Rosa, CA) we zoomed? up to Mt. Shasta, hiked about, and 
camped on the base that night.  On I5, doing those arduous climbs, at 35-50 mph, 
with the trucks, I watched our new guages with trepidation as the needles 
climbed.....it didn't really overheat until the 14 mile ascent to Bunny Flat on 
the side of the mountain.  When the oil temp. read 250, we stopped and rested 
for awhile....the head temp didn't get too hot, but then that is all relative, 
because I am not sure if what it tends to say most of the time is good.

***I took a long break to do stuff***

We then had much freaking out, for I had noticed, to my chagrin, that when 
starting the thing up when cold, or at idle when it was really hot, that there 
was a new noise...sounding like metal on metal, and I didn't like it.  To top 
that all off, the starter did not want to live up to its name after driving for 
a while...stop to get gas near a hill, or creep under and bang on it...!

Can I build a large (2200cc) engine with hi-performance heads that would fit 
easily into our '81 Vanagon? (Porsche?  But would nee to modify the intake and 
exhaust thingies.....We need more power for the mountains!  It is very hard to 
abuse engine so!

If anyone really wants to hear of the rest (highlights) of our trip, or if you 
think you saw us, speak up....otherwise, I'll not spend long time writing when I 
could be reading......

Later,
Gene
