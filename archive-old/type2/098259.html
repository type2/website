Subject: HELP! rear end droning noise

if i cant get this sudden problem resolved, or diagnosed ASAP, i dont
think i will be making it to omaha this weekend, so here it is...

(70 westy) driving home today, got to about 35MPH and i started hearing a
droning noise from the back somewhere. driving under this speed doesnt
seem to cause the noise. cant tell if it is coming from left, right or
center. braking didnt seem to change it. letting off the gas seems to
lessen it or make it go away, from what little i was willing to make it
do. i may even be wrong about that. sorry i cant tell you any more
information than that. 

my drive, planning on leaving first thing in the morning, will be about 8
hours, averaging probably 65MPH. if it is doing this at 35, i hate to
think what it will do at 65... but what i am most worried about is what
damage i may be doing driving on it at all, much less such a long
distance.

please help, i am looking forward to this trip, but maybe it is an omen
telling me i shouldnt go...
