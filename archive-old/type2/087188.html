Subject: Re: [T2] hiccup..excuse me..

Collie,

I would think more like the auto tranny needs new fluid or some sort of 
adjustment.  Sounds like the torque converter is trying to engage before 
you are ready....don't know much about vw auto tranny tho.

Maybe replace any vacuum tubing to the tranny controls first?

Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; Problem: My bus has developed a bit of a hiccup in the last little while. It
&gt; started last summer (faintly) and has progressed slowly. The 3300 km trip to
&gt; Everybus and back really made this hiccup prominent. Anybody have any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt;  Symptoms: Only happens at idle. Only happens when in Drive (remember the
&gt; AUTO tranny). Engine idles and every few seconds it &quot;hiccups&quot; and causes the
&gt; engine to pulse.
&gt; 
&gt; I have checked the timing, dead on 7.5, idle is dead on at 950 RPM, points,
&gt; rotor, cap and wires all new and problem persists. I have found that is
&gt; worse in warmer temperatures and causes a slight bogging on low rpm (1st
&gt; gear) when engine is warmed up.
&gt; 
&gt; The funny part to this is the fact that it only happens when I have the van
&gt; in Drive or reverse. I have tons of power, runs perfect at high RPM and
&gt; idles perfect in Park or Neutral. Can anybody explain this situation before
&gt; I start replacing FI parts one-by-one?
&gt; 
&gt; AFM?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW...It was great to meet y'all at EBUS 2002 (my third one) and I look
&gt; forward to next year already.....

&gt; Ted, I missed your cherries......
