Subject: '78 exhaust q's

hey volks,

took the 'new' 78 rustfalia on it's maiden, tho' short, voyage this weekend
to my (an nohemi's :-) first 'vw classic' show in irvine, ca. all i can say
is wow. didn't see any listees, but with a 3 year old, we were more
concerned with finding cookies and getting back to the beach ;-) anyway, i
still have an annoying exhaust leak. passed ca smog but it's troublesome to
sensitive ears. appears to be at the heater box manifolds, which are very
crusty! since i won't be using heat here in socal, i was thinking of not
replacing the heater boxes but using one of various 'pipe kits' available.
anyone have any experience or opinions about these? i'm not looking for more
power or anything, just to save a little bread on something i won't use.
fwiw, the rustfalia isn't a daily, just for camping and such.

thanks!

tony
