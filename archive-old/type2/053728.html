Subject: Help I need this part.

I need the flanged rubber filler neck that is immediately behind the gas
cap.  I noticed that on left turns, gas pours out.  That's not good.  I
know we've all been trying to fix ours, but where can I get a new one?
A guy told me he got one from Australia, but the email address he sent
was unknown.  Bus depot and rmmw don't have them.

    I need one soon.  Thanks.

Always looking for the swingy table and leg for my westy.
Maybe someone picked mine up from the side of the road?
