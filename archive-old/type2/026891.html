Subject: replacing rear tranny seal

Well I have finally decided to pull my engine and replace the rear tranny 
seal. It still does ok around town but whenever I jump on the highway out 
goes the tranny fluid. This will be my first engine pull on a bus, I did 
however do an apprenticeship this summer at the local VW shop (German 
Imports) and got to pull and tear down a type 1 motor, and since I don't 
have FI I don't think I should have much trouble. I have spent some time 
searching the archives, but I must not be using the right words as I am 
having trouble finding info on this seal. I searched the BD website and 
can't find anything on rear tranny seal, what is the official name of the 
seal? If anyone has any helpful suggestions in the replacement of this feel 
free to email me, I will welcome all advice.

Nathan,
74 Bus (1.8L dual kadrons)
85 Westy
