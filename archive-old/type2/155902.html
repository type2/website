Subject: Re: [T2] Oil cooler as heat source inside van.

&gt; On the bad/good continum that
&gt; would be to the left of the scale.

Yeah, it just sounds like way more work than it's worth.

My plans for the Guac have hardened. Unless a $45 gas heater falls
from the sky (Dan).

A pair of bilge blowers attached to the heat exchanger stovepipes
(risers, whateverthey'recalled) in the engine compartment. Hoses up
into the scoops with vents going into the cabin. So I have the air
from the cabin going through the bilge blowers and through the heat
exchangers.

I've priced everything and I should be able to do it for around $100.
The only concern is attaching to the right hand stovepipe. It's not
round, but oval. So I'll need either something flexible or to fab
something up with sheetmetal. I welcome suggestions here...
