Subject: Re: [T2] METAL TAG

&gt; I too have found such a metal tag in one of my Bugs.
&gt; It was also found under a seat.
&gt; The tag was about one fourth and inch by
&gt; one and a half inches.  The numbers on my tag were
&gt; the last seven numbers of my VIN.  I suspect, at
&gt; least 

This year I saw two pretty original 1968 bays. Both
had a tag you describe attached (with a ring) to the
original keys.


yours,

Vincent
