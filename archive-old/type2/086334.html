Subject: Engine Removal, Supporting Tranny

&gt;Do you have to support the tranny?  I have no idea, but I bet that if you
&gt;don't, it makes for some interesting angles when you go to put the
&gt;engine back in (you'd prolly have to jack the front of the tranny up.)

Some do some don't. The earlier 68-71 models usually don't have the rear
support
bracket. If they don't, put the standard VW bug scissor jack under it with a
thick
hardcover book that you don't care about, extend the scissor jack up with
the book
between the jack and trans. Then remove the engine. When you install the
engine, use
your floor jack to get the input shaft close, then use the scissor jack on
the trans
to make final adjustments until the flywheel starts to disappear in the bell
housing,
then turn the scissor jack down one turn, get behind the motor, grab the top
of the fan
shroud and the muffler and rock it in. This is called the 'Rocking Horse
Winner' method,
named after a short story in the anthology used to hold up the trans.
