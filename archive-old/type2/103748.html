Subject: Re: [T2] WEBER CARB

Darren:

Take a look in the archives for info on the weber (sometimes in the archives
it's &quot;webber&quot;).  a/k/a a &quot;progressive&quot; carb.

There should be a small port (6-7 mm) on the weber for a vacuum line to go
to the vacuum advance on the distributor.  About half way up from the base
if I remember... This should be connected or blocked off;  otherwise it's a
GREAT BIG vacuum leak.

p-mail me if you have any other questions.

Subject: [T2] WEBER CARB


&gt; Howdy Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I have a 72 van , 1800 engine that I just bought.
&gt; My other 72 van , 1700 engine got siezed.
&gt; The thing is: this van i just bought has a single weber carb.
&gt; I have an advance distrubutor and the vacuum lines are blocked off
&gt; and are not connected to the carb?does anyone out there have one of these
&gt; single
&gt; weber carbs? if so whats the deal with the vacuum lines?aren't they
supposed
&gt; to
&gt; attach to the carb?
&gt; Please tell me anything you might know about this mystery.
