Subject: RE: [T2] Engine dolly plan is now available as a .pdf file

Having now seen a picture of this dolly, I have a
suggestion that I've been using for a while now. 

I recently purchased a motorcycle hoist, which I use
in very much the same manner as the engine dolly shown
in the photo, and it has been a great help. Makes
those one-man engine removals and installs pretty much
a breeze. The arms are just about the same width apart
as the width of the case. 

If you've never seen one, this is a link to a basic
model. Mine has a foot pedal lift instead of the long
jack-handle, but the concept is the same.
