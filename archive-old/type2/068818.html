Subject: Digital Cameras and Web Pages

Hello Volks - I've been thinking.....

For quite some time I have been pondering how to go about getting my many 
pictures posted to the net so you all could see them.  So far I've been 
extremely fortunate to have Steve Donovan and Robert Kuhn come to my aid 
in posting my pictures on their WEB pages. 

My big problem is getting the pictures scanned in.  I would love to be 
able to document a repair job as I do it and get the pictures scanned and 
presentable the same or next day.  Polaroids lack quality and standard 
film takes time to develop.  Scanners are cool but the cheap ones won't 
work on Amiga's and neither will the PC-only software.  

So a few months ago Volks, I started browsing around and stumbled across 
Kodak's web page and lo, there was talk of a digital camera.  I signed up 
to be notified of the press release and it just arrived.  The camera will 
hold up to 29 pictures and costs $499.00.  This includes software and cables 
to hook it up to a PC.  I'm kind of excited about this as I am wanting to 
go the PC route here this winter and a digital camera would go real nice 
with the setup.  

So if any of you have been contemplating snapping pix of your VW projects 
or anything else, I'd gladly send you the press release in private 
e-mail.
