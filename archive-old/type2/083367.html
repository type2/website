This suit sounds so plausible, &amp; many ppl's knee-jerk

 What does a
multinational want with such small potatoes as junk
art??  This
multinational which would kinda like to forget about
its aircooled
past, anyway.  When questioned, it turned out that my
lady worked for
&quot;Fica &amp; Associates,&quot; that &quot;Fica&quot; was just the lawyer's
name
(tee-hee!) not some government agency!  Just maybe,
VWoA is Verner
Wimble of Acron, Attorney at Law.  I hope so!

A good thing to point out is that VWoA's own test lab
had some spare parts hanging around the lab.  The guys
that work there decided to make a nice looking mailbox
 setup with these spare parts. (mostly VW and Audi
rims)  I have seen this mailbox and have a relative
that works in the lab as a test engineer, so I am
keeping names out of this.  Would this then mean that
VWoA should sue or fire the employees that made this
&quot;folksy&quot; art mailbox?  Sounds like the pot is calling
the kettle black...
  Just food for thought.

PS- why would VWoA need Lawyers in Indy when there is
a ton in their area. (Detroit Metro)
