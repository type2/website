(Replying to Tom Forhan, re trip from St. Lous around Michigan shores....)
Hi- we took our 78 Westie for a 6 wk trip around USA last fall, and went
from NJ thru Ohio and stopped at Indiana Dunes  Nat. Seashore, not to be
missed if you are heading as I think you will around the bottom of Lake
Michigan?  Stop at Indiana Dunes St. Park; our 9 yr old loved the shore,
which looks like ocean, but is calmer, no jellifish or crabs, and was great
to walk along.  I seem to remember we stopped at a Nature center and took a
trail to the beach, which is pretty challenging, since it goes right over a
Dune thru a Dune &quot;forest&quot;- We walked north and cut back in to a real road
thru a ritzy &quot;private&quot; community to get back to road where parking was.
For bugs (I remember only horseflies), don't use that toxic DEET, but go to
a feed/horse supply store and get a bottle of Citronella Oil- you dilute it
6:1 at least with water, and keep in a spray bottle (like old Windex
bottle)- spray your hat, clothes, neck, exposed legs, and it will work fine
if you don't mind citronella smell (better than DEET, and doesn't dissolve everything!)
     In '84 I bicycled to Oregon from NJ thru Canada into Northern
Peninsula (Manitoulin Islands were quaint, glad I took the ferry to go thru
them), and found Mackinac Island to be great (for bikes, no cars allowed-
take the ferry across with your bikes...)  Pictured Rocks was good, but
then it had sand packed roads, may be a challenge for Bus?   Make sure you
take a tent along; some places may only have tenting sites as overflow, and
then you can park there (and use camper); other places you need your tent
if you want to be by the shore...have a good trip...MB
PS- get the Woodall's Camping guide, or Join Good Sam (they have equally
good guide); like their road protection plan, which will tow you 300 mi if
necessary to get the vehicle the service it needs; good if the nearest AC
engine is that far away!  The Woodalls rates the rec. areas in campgrounds
and lists what they have....get it!
