Subject: Re: [T2] New-fangled FI plenum

Mark,

The DIY fuel injection folks would say yes.  The plenum volume
&quot;should&quot; be the same size as the engine displacement.

You can also &quot;tune&quot; for a particular rpm range by the length of the runner 
intakes and the size of the plenum....there are big books on this that 
come with math formulas to choose what you want...

Go here http://www.dune-buggy_dot_com/turbo/intake.htm

look at the pics and read the text....you are probably better off leaving 
it alone....just my opinion...&lt;grin&gt;



Cheers, dave

&gt; Every time I page through Ron Fornier's sheet metal book, I get the 
&gt; idea that I would like to do a more updated plenum for my 2.0L engine. 
snip&gt; 
&gt; 1. The width of the engine cannot be fixed (hence those pesky hoses) 
&gt; because CR is adjusted by adding or taking out rings. Seems to me that 
&gt; the best way to resolve this is by making up custom-width gaskets 
&gt; between runners and heads.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have a better way?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. I wonder whether the volume inside the plenum is critical. Once air 
&gt; passes through the AFM and gets metered, does it matter how much air is 
&gt; inside the plenum?
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas would be helpful.
