One other detail that I find helps is to oil the U-shaped hinge for the middle slider mechanism. Get the door opened, look at the rear of the door at the U thingy. You will see a smll slot where it pivots. Shoot some 3 in 1 oil or whatever you have in there. I have used that method to get some really stuck doors to operate very smoothly. If you have a Haines manual, it goes through the procudure on lubing all the doors.

Happy Door Opening
Chris
