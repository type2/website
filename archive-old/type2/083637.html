Subject: Re: [T2] 22-24 mpg = lean?

Ray,

Stock '78 FI on a stock '78 2L in the '73 body, I get 19-20 like
clockwork. If you lived down the street and got 22 I woudl say it was
within the margin of error.  Given your location, tho, I worry a bit.  I
am &quot;down in the flats&quot; and you are not.  When I am visiting John, my
mileage goes down significantly, maybe 17-19.  If you are getting 22 where
I get 17, *then* I worry about lean.  OTOH... lean vs. rich is important
to prevent overheating.  If you are not, then feel blessed and keep on
truckin'!
