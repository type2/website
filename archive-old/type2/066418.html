Subject: Re: Clutch cylinder rebuild kits?

FWIW I got the rebuild kits for the clutch master and slave
cylinders the other day from my local import parts guy.  VW
had only the slave kit available for $31, well import guy
wants $20 for master kit (2 seals, 1 belows, 1 clip) and
$20 for slave kit for FAG cylinder (1 seal, 1 belows, 2 clips)
and $15 for slave kit for ATE cylinder (as above, 1 clip) I bought
all these as both Vans '81 and '85 needed rebuilt, and they have
each type of slave.  They also have 1 ATE and 1 FAG master but
the rebuild kit is interchangeable for masters.  

Further FWIW the master cylinder kit is Beck/Arnley World Parts
part no 071-7491 is made in germany with a FAG bellows but
&quot;generic&quot; seals.

The FAG slave kit is a FahrzeugTechnik part contains all FAG
rubber components and carries their number 656-111 or VW 251 798 041
Bellows is FAG K2559, seal is FAG H25305

The ATE slave kit is a Wagner kit again with all FAG parts their
part F103522.  Bellows is FAG K2351 6, seal is FAG H25302, seals
are near enough interchangeable, bellows are drastically different
diameters, we'll see if everything fits tomorrow weather allowing.

I also had to pick up a smaller 2 stone cylinder hone for the
master cylinders which set me back $14 for a nice Lisle tool
but annoyingly the stones are fairly coarse and finer were
not to be had, as I'm not about to make a final finish hone
and can't get sandpaper far enough down the small bores, I'll
live with the finish, better than I had anyway.

So for a total investment of about $90 I'm rebuilding all
4 cylinders, where 1 rebuilt master was going to run me the
same amount.  I'm pretty satisfied but have only thus rebuilt
the masters, will do the slaves tomorrow.  Seals were not
quite like OEM for the masters but should not affect function.

I STRONGLY URGE people to bleed these things out now while you
can, standard brake procedure works fine regardless of Bentleys
warnings to use a pressure bleeder, Haynes says do it the old
fashioned way.  The master cylinders in these systems have some
rather intricate and in both of my cases rather clogged valving
in the piston and resevoir feed.  I'm not even sure what the valves
do entirely but expect both my systems to be much improved.  Bleeding
these would have prevented the profound amounts of sediment from
forming in each, let alone the rust.
