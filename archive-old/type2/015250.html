Subject: FS: 1970 Westfalia w/1776  
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am in need of money for school. Tuition is due soon and so push is coming
to shove and I'm going to have to sell my ongoing project. Maggie is a
magic bus that has a 1776 DP motor in it. I just put it in with a stock
solex setup, I have the dual Kadrons in my garage along with extra engine
tin, and various other parts.
I can't tell you much about her because she's only been in my driveway for
about 10 months. 
She's yellow (like bug yellow, not chrome), pop-topped, fairly straight,
fairly spotted with rust around the usual areas, new clutch, pressure
plate, t/o bearing, rear shocks, engine seal.
Needs: new front breaks, steering box rebuild, some electrical work, and a
good body shop.

I'd like to get as much as I can for her, come by take a look. Im in
Ellensburg Washington. Make an offer I can't refuse and take her away. Oh,
one more thing, she runs.


Thanks.

Jay Santos
