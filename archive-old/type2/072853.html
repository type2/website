Subject: Re: Help '79 bus backfires / won't start.

You sound like you know what you're doing, so I'll assume the cam was
installed correctly and the distributor is not, say, 180 deg. off.

Is the flap in the AFC box still moving? Get it unstuck with back of long
screwdriver pushed from side of air filter housing.

Is the wire harness connected correctly, in particular are MultiProng
Connector to cold-start valve (green) and MPC to aux air regulator (black)
not inverted?

Is connection to CHT sensor solid (check resistance at ECU end of wire
harness -- approx. 2500 Ohm)?

You could also check the AFC troubleshooter website at
http://wueconb.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/afc/  but I don't remember there being
something on backfiring.

Sami
