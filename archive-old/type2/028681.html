Subject: Elec. ignition, oil temp/RPM questions

Fellow and sister Bussers:

Been a while since I posted.

I recently inherited a MagFire electronic ignition, sans instructions. There
are two wires. One must go to the coil (but is it the positive or negative
terminal?), and the other? Is it a ground connection (which I am inclined to
believe), or does it go somewhere else? Any form of enlightenment is much
appreciated. (And any websites out there where I can download instructions?)

I also have an oil temperature/RPM question. I have a '71 Westy hardtop,
1776 dual Kadron engine w/ standard doghouse oil cooler, freeway flyer
tranny. I had chrome tins, but she ran a little too hot for my comfort
(DUH!). I switched back to black tins, and things have cooled down a bit,
but I was hoping to open a can-of-worms on the list by asking for some
opinions on performance. Here's the question: In our wonderful North
Carolina summer heat (85-95 F.) I can cruise at about 73-75 MPH running at
about 3500 rpm, but my oil temp climbs up to around 240-250 degrees. (This
speed is not uncomfortable to drive; the Magic Bus feels very stable and
solid -- and I can stay in the traffic flow). When I back down on the speed
to around 65 MPH, the RPM's drop (of course) to about 3000/3100, and the oil
cools to about 220-230.

Do these numbers make sense? Am I running too hot and revving too high at
the upper cruising speed? Your (perhaps not-so-humble?) opinions -- and any
suggestions for better performance -- would be most welcome.

Many thanks in advance.
