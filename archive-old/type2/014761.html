Hey all,
  I just figured out the MPG of my 71 Westy and was very pleased. It is a
full Westy with pop-top and has a 1600cc DP with Dual Kadrons and an Empi
single Quiet pack, all else is stock. I just droped the carbs on and have
not realy done any Syncronizing or rejetting. I also have not set the valves
in too long(shame on me). With all that I am getting 18.8MPG and I am
thrilled with the power it has. It won't race Vettes and stangs but it will
climb hill and merge on the highway with no trouble at all. Now I can start
tuning and use this as a base line. I would love to see 20MPG.
