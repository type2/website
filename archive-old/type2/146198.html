Subject: Re: [T2] wanted: watercooled replacement engine for 1973 Bus

336-882-7600 This is Roberts number in NC. He does the water cooled  
conversions on Bay buses. I think his site is _www.veggiewerkes_dot_com_ 
(http://www.veggiewerkes_dot_com)    He does  the diesel conversions but, the gas conversions are 
exactly the same.
