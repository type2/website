Subject: Re: [T2]Westy models



 did they make 3 models every year or just after a
 certain time? my 70 has the camp stool and all your usual poptop stuff
 but i have no stove. i didnt think they installed stoves until later.

68-71 westies could be had in at least 7 diff configurations, some which had
yes gas cookers and electric icebox. Unfortuately many models didnt make it
here from Germany. One that did is the so-69 pkg which was fitted to the
bench westy and had a cooker,ice box and full length closet behind the
driver instead of the blind spot on the right side of most westies, haveing
instead a full width bed. Could be fitted with the small pop top. And then
there is the holy grail of campers (well at least to me) the dormobile top
and the so-69 westy camp gear bus.
