&gt;there any personal experiences with this or any similar tire in this size?

I ran them and they handled very, very well.  Very stable.  Ride was a bit 
harsher and noiser than with other tires but not excessive, and worth it 
IMO.  My bus, at about 3800lbs with no passengers is on the heavy side too.
