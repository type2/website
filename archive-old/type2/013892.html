Subject: Vac advance distributor hoses. Where do they go?

Hello list,

I have a simple question for you. I know I have had
alot of those lately. I just installed my vacuum
advance distributor unit in my 73 bus. The bus itself
is a 74. The engine is from a 73 and the carbs are a
set of stock solex carburators from a 72.

&lt;QUESTION&gt;

Where do the vacuum lines hook up from the vacuum can
on the distributor? I saw a bus the other day with the
bottom vacuum line connected to an EGR valve and the
top one to a vacuum line on the left carburator. I do
Not have egr (72 year model carbs). Where do they hook
up to? Does one vacuum line go to one carb and the
other vacuum line go to the other carb?
