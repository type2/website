Subject: Re: [T2] Counterfeit VW parts

&gt;
&gt;It's crazy that they are going after guys that are supporting the VW hobby,
&gt;yet they not doing this to eliminate competition in a market that they are
&gt;competing in, or willing to START competing in. They are simply doing it to
&gt;be vindictive and &quot;protect&quot; their copyright.
&gt;

Can we agree that no one can determine the intent of another with any
certainty??? I know I can't. If I am to presume what someone else intends I
probably will never seek further evidence. We make such assuptions to
relieve us of the effort to truly understand the other side of the coin. It
is inaction founded in laziness. Assumption is so much easier than truth,
it's no contest. 

I can't accept the assumtion that the corporation who created what I like
most in engineering systems is a villian now interested in my T-II turning
to rust so they might sell me the current production model molded by the
demand for wizbang by the new market croud in America, therefore costing at
least 25% more than the vehicle I might consider buying for my sence of
values.
