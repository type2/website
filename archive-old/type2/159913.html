&gt; Anyone have any experience reapplying the wall paper like stuff that goes, for

&gt; there are alternatives .. for example I know a guy who removed the stuff and
&gt; painted .. looks great .. but I want to restore the wall paper like stuff.

Just to throw another idea into the mix, I used fabric that looks kinda 
like water/clouds and people love it.  Plus, it really makes the bus 
look more spacious.  You might want to try it ;)
