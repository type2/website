Hi there!

I'm living in Eugene, Oregon and I've got a friend who's trying to sell his
'72 VW Camper.  I'm looking for an idea of what the bus would be worth around
this area so he knows what to ask for it.  Here's the info:  1972 standard
pop-top camper, one owner, approx. 65,000 miles on rebuild, dual carbs, new
tires, has the front seat cot.  He also has one of the highly prized stand-
alone side tents that he may or may not sell with the bus.  Any ideas would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks much!

Kim
