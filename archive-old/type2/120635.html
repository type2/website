Subject: [T2]windshield wiper motors 76 and 76 ?

ok so i have a 76 wiper motor and was going to take it out of my 76 .....
the one i have is fine except for when you cut on the wipers the wipers go a little bit at first and then this grinding sound ....like something is stripped out in the motor....?
pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop 
ok so i pull it and reading the bentley am aware of the difference in the plug or straight wired...
 
the used one i am installing or hopeing to looks like it was straight wired....
and it has a metal piece at the top of the motor that looks like a wire with a female connection hooks to it,... 
 
ok from the motor (one to be installed) straight wired is a black wire... light green wire....black wire with grey stripe....black wire with yellow stripe.....
 
now on the motor i am takeing out it being a plug.... before the plug and connection at motor i see 
brown wire......
black wire light blue stripe
black wire with white stripe
black wire with yeallow stripe
black wire with green stripe
 
so confusion sets in...
 
any help with this would be most appreciated ... i have two big new air holes now in the front and really dont want to have to put the broke one back in ....
thanks in advance 
peace
Chris
