&gt; What's the &quot;baseline&quot; adjustment for the idle (Air Bypass) screw on a

&gt; I know that the usual setting for carbs is two turns back from all the
&gt; way in. But  I was wondering if there's a similar starting point (so to
&gt; speak) for the FI idle?

There is no baseline that I know of.  The only way to adjust this screw is
with an exhaust gas analyzer.

                             OOK!
