Subject: Re: [T2] Automobiles on the History Channel

&gt;&gt;History of the beetle and bus and lots of
 archive footage from the Wolfsburg
factory showing engine and body assembly.&lt;&lt;

Richard &amp; list:

they frequently re-broadcast shows like this.

if anyone has a heads up on when it will be shown
again, i would really like to know.

i already checked the History Channel's website &amp; it
doesn't look like it's on at least until the end
of this month.

TIA,
