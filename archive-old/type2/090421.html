&gt; hi - two weeks ago i adopted a stray AHxxxxxx engine out of a 71 hardtop
&gt; westy. nice deal upon closer inspection - DP heads have brand new guides,
&gt; all the dog house thermostat stuff is there including hoover bit, and i
&gt; fig'd, well what to do with this case. i went to undo the oil plug and to
&gt; my surprise odd strainer with no plug. just six 10mm nuts under the sump.
&gt; research shows this is a 74bug engine. did they really have to undo all
&gt; those nuts to change oil?

Yup! and over time, they got to be a royal PITA.  The cap nuts disappear,
the cap nuts get replaced wiht plain nuts, the studs come out, the studs
get replaced with bolts, the holes strip, the holes get tapped for stepped
studs (cute little buggers :-) etc.  etc.  Even if you have a plug, you
are *supposed* to pul the plate to inspect for bits of bearing, etc. that
will serve as an early warning that it is time for a rebuild. but once you
have the plug... fuggedaboudit!  My '63 beetle had solid plate, my '71
stupid beetle had a drain plug. Your '74 *should* have had a drain plug...
but after 30 years, anything is possible.

&gt; can that plate be replaced with one having a plug.

Plates with plugs are all over the place.  *Flat* plates with plugs, like
flat solid plates are rarer, but you can buy them new from (I think)
bugpack.

&gt; heavens to betsy  - steve, dun't remember ever driving a bug...
