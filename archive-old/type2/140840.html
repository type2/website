Subject: Re: [T2] Audi Wheels on CL in CO

I have a set of 2000 passat 15in wheels for my 71 the rears fit fine but the
fronts needed to have the centers opened up a little, a dye grinder works
great for this:) A friend just put on a set of 17in a4 wheels and had to do
the same thing

&gt; FWIW...
&gt;
&gt; I just tried a set of 16s off my wife's A6 the other day. The bolt pattern
&gt; is correct on these wheels (5x112 iirc), as is the back spacing, but the
&gt; center bore is too small and would have to be enlarged for them to fit
over
&gt; the hubs. Anyway, if you've got the means to modify these a bitt, it might
&gt; be a cool project...
