 Here in Oregon, we are `not allowed` to pump our own
gas.  So I cannot provide the TLC needed to prevent
damage to the rubber filler neck during refueling.  As
a result, my 78 fuel filler neck gets damaged
(perforated) about twice a year, by careless
entry-level gas station employees.  I know its damaged
when a strong gasoline smell hangs about the bus cabin
while driving (as the gasoline is jostling about).
The damage is always identical...it is in the same
place without fail.  The rubber filler neck gets
pinched &amp; perforated between the gasoline filler pipe
and the sheet metal.  I temporarily patch the leak
with silicone RTV caulk.  Later, when I have time, I
replace the rubber part _at_ $22 + S/H per repair.

Sounds like you need the ultra hard to find VW fuel filler unleaded collar.

I sent one to Richard Atwell and he has it on his site somewhere......
but I can never find it.  I just gave one to Jim Thompson so Ventura Wherehouse Group can repro it.

I have one more.

It is a filler neck collar that has a hole in it to fit unleaded nozzles. They can't break the birds beak with
it! Four screws hold it in, just remove them and replace the collar.
