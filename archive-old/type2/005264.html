Subject: bucking at low throttle problem (please read)
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2000 08:36:50 -0500

Dear list!
I need some advice.  My '77 FI bucks as if missing when I drive with the
throttle anywhere between all the way up and floored.  In neutral the motor
revs up fine and I can hold it at half throttle and it doesn't miss.  It
only bucks when the motor is under a load.  If I floor it or let all the way
up it stops bucking.  I just finished a tune up hoping to find the problem
but it is still there.  I can't really drive it to work anymore.  It's got
new rotor, cap, wires, and plugs.  Timing is right on at idle and advances
with RPM.  Starts up hot or cold and idles fine.  I fixed all vacuum leaks.
It's got the stock vacuum/mechanical advance distributor and if I rotate the
rotor clockwise and let it go it snaps back into position.  It's bucked
before but more intermittently and I always thought it was an electrical
problem and I'd get a new cap and it would go away for a while.  Could the
air flow meter be worn out?  Does the ECU have any way of knowing full
throttle besides the AFM (...as it runs fine at full throttle)?  Thanks!
Any advice is greatly appreciated!
