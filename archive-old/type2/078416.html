&lt;&lt; The good news is that driving without a windshield is almost *never*
illegal (1).  If it were, then motorcycles would all need fairings to use
the roads.  Not having eye protection is, for good reason, almost
universally illegal tho.  If you do drive w/o a windshield, wear
goggles/glasses, for legalities and safeties sake!

I've argued that the &quot;Brookland's windscreens&quot; on my Bugeye were a
replacement for the missing windshield, but the officer disagreed and
wanted to see the inspection sticker. Don't know about &quot;your&quot; state,
but it's illegal in NJ to do anything that makes the sticker not read-
ily viewable i.e. removing the windshield. At least that's what the po-
lice officer told me. I suspect that if you are carrying the replacement
or new glass with you you might get around this, but the law's the law
