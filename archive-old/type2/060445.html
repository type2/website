Subject: Spring Plate Rubber Bushings

I notice two different opinions on slicking down the rubber bushings for
the rear torsion bar/spring plate connection.  I seek additional
guidance.

Bentley says: &quot;Coat the inner &amp; outer rubber bushing with talcum powder
only.  Caution  Do not coat the rubber bushings with graphite.  It will
permit the spring plate hub to turn in the bushing, resulting in rapid
wear.  Do not allow multipurpose grease or other petroleum based
lubricants to contaminate the bushings since these substances are
harmful to rubber.&quot;  

Haynes says: &quot;cover [rubber mounting bushes] with flake graphite (to
prevent squeaking)&quot;

Just Kampers says: (on a different topic, but still appropriate ) Do not
use normal liquid detergent for a lubricant on the window rubbers,
because most of these products contain SALT!! (my paraphrase)

My question:  How would it be if I used mineral oil (specifically,
Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Oil).  Since it is not petroleum based, would
this work fine??  And how about vegetable or other type of cooking oil??

I will go the talcum route, but I just wanted other technical opinions.


On installation of the spring plate rubber bushes, 

Bentley say: 1 install inner rubber bushing, 2 install spring plate &amp;
adjust torsion bar, 3 install outer bushing. 

Haynes says 1 &quot;Having reset the torsion bar so that the plate angle is
correct, make sure the rubber bushes are in good condition.  Renew if in
doubt.&quot;  This means that I first adjust the angle, then removing and
replacing the spring plate to replace the rubber bushes.

Is it that difficult to work with new rubber bushings?  Does the inner
bushing HAVE to be on the spring plate to get the proper angle?

Thanks.  (It IS Friday!!!)
