&lt;&lt; I saw a Sachs clutch kit in a bus at the junkyard today. The pressure plate
was rusty on one side, shiny on the flywheel side, the disk was new and both
stamped Made in Germany. There was an INA German pilot bearing, and a Made
In Germany throwout bearing in a separate box in the kit. Attached to the PP
and disc were bright orange made in Mexico stickers. Sure enough on closer
inspection of the disk, a la Dr. Tim, the rivets were horrible. At least the
alignment tool was nice.

Showin' my age dept: Usta be a small shop in my area years ago (Blank
Brake and Clutch Exchange), that for a reasonable fee would rebuild
your old units and even upgrade to beefier springs or thicker linings...
