Subject: Quick help needed on how to unsubscribe / vacation

howdy volks,

well, after many years on many lists....i finally have
to send out one of these &lt;grins&gt;.  if some kind soul
would email me (in the next 60 minutes or so - it's
1pm cst), i'd LOVE to know how to unsubscribe as i'm
going away for a military school and my inbox
won't/can't keep up.  MANY THANKS in advance!  (the
webpage was of no help....)

~j.
