James Matta querries:

        Please excuse the ignorance. Can someone tell me what a &quot;Kombi&quot; is?



A Kombi is the basic passenger van. It has the lowest level of trim, =
usually cardboard ceiling panels and side panels. On a splittie, it =
usually has only three windows on each side in the passenger =
compartment.

The original idea behind the Kombi (or kombination) was that it could be =
used during the week (with the seats removed) as a delivery van, and on =
weekends (with the seats back in place) used as a family car.
