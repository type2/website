Subject: weber 40 idf part needed!

yo

i just got a set of dual weber idf 40, wow what a nice setup, i got them
from a previous 2L type 4 owner, so i thought all jet was ok ! well no :(

it has 32 venturis, 200 air, 115 main but i suspect they are drilled to
130m, F11 emulsion tube, 50 idle, 50 pump !

At first i had stumble problem around 70-80 kmh, i was then with 52 idle, i
replaced to 50 idle and no more stumbling but less power...

Im running a bit rich, some black smoke, usually when acceleration (pump
jet?) so im now thinking of changing some part!!

Im looking to go F7 emulsion, 185 air and 135 main jet ... (4 x venturi =
132=135 main jet by the book)

my engine is a stock 914 type 4 (96mm big bore piston) it give me 1911 cc

I wish i could get better gas mileage too

Anyone has these jet they are willing to sell me ? is my setup okay ?

mike
