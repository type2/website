Subject: Oil Pressure Relief Tool

I asked a while back if anyone knew where to get one of these or what to 
use. I have been using a modified prybar to remove the plug to get to the 
oil pressure relief valve. In casual conversation with the mechanic in my 
shop he gave me this.

It is now sitting on my desk and I can't wait to try it out. Although it is 
a loaner atleast I can find them now. He said he uses it for King Pins on 
the big trucks. The only markings on it are

Snap-On A15 USA.

I will keep you posted how it fits/works.

Thanks,
