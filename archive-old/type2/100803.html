Subject: Fwd: Boston Bob on cases/line boring

I see the type 2 list is talking about align boring the type 2 cases I am
not on that list at this point could you please let them know that I can
align bore the type 2 cases. The other point that needs to be made is that
the west coast shop have preset cutters and this is a problem because
different brands of bearings do not measure the same you cold in fact wind
up with no bearing crush on a freshly cut case. As you know I have a large
supply of German align bore bearings and I measure and cut each case to
match the bearing size.
