Subject: Re: Thanks to Karl von Salzen &amp; the List

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;Many thanks to the generous list members, and especially to Karl
&gt;(Also, my p-mail to him is being returned so I have no other way than
&gt;this to thank him.)

Yeah Karl - I tried to acknowledge the light switch you sent, but your mail
is bouncing!
Get it fixed so we can ask for more things you will then pull out of your hat!
