&gt; &gt;Or the filler hose. I don't think you can access any of this stuff
&gt; *without* pulling the firewall.

&gt; One of them can.  In my case, it was the one that was leaking.  It's the
&gt; one right next to the filler hose and therefore you can reach it through
&gt; the round access hole with the black lid in it.  

Yeah, I wouldn't remove the panel just to get at the filler hose. On the other hand, it took me two hands to get a non-collapsible hose to stay put on the neck of the gas tank &amp; bend some 70-80 degrees to the PO-installed fuel pipe. Couldn't have done it just through the roundy hole.

Perhaps a better fix would have been to replace the pipe with a pipe that had two bends. Oh well.
