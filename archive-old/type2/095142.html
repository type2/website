Subject: Re: [T2] Blistered Electrodes

&gt;&gt;Fact or country myth??
&gt;&gt;Machine shop person said that if the spark plugs show microscopic 
&gt;&gt;blistering on the outside of the spark plug electrode, it indicates that 
&gt;&gt;the engine has bad or worn valve guides.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Outside of the electrode is the other side from where the spark jumps.
&gt;======================&gt;
&gt;Oh Oh !!
&gt;I just noticed this same thing on my NewBus #3 plug the other day
&gt;when I had it out and was trying to determine if it was practical to insert 
&gt;a CHT sender under that plug.
&gt;
&gt;I have been wondering about those small blisters I saw, as I had never 
&gt;noticed them ever before on any other plug anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;Bob Perring

OK, Bob, how about taking a picture of the blistering and posting it.

If it is not in your camera capabilities, does anyone offer to capture the 
'microscopic blistering' with their setup??

Barry sends (unlike John Wayne Bobbitt, I would not like it published that 
'my' most private member was reattached with the miracle of modern 
microscopic surgery.  Rather, I would like the doctors to report 'we had to 
use ice thongs and a jack hammer!!!')

Hey, man, it's all in the wrist!!
