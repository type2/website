I have known Larry's Off-road for about 6 years. They are a good,
knowledgeable bunch, very into VW's. All dealings I have had with them have
been very satisfactory.

While we are on the subject of vendors, I will give a shameless plug for
Drew's Off-Road. Brian Drew and his crew have been into VW's forever and
they have built engines for me. There work was great and very reasonable.
They seem to 'go the extra mile' to please their customers. They ship UPS
daily and take major credit cards. If anyone is interested I will furnish
their phone #.
