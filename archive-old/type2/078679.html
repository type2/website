Chris,

If in fact you can cleanly pull ( or drop in ths instance ) an engine
out of a late model bus in 30 minutes or less, stop in some day---this
might just be interesting.

And by cleanly I mean marking all the electrical and vacuum connections
so it doesn't take a month to return it to it's original state.

A early bus and a bus with a suitcase engine are two different animals. 

Later,

Terry

E-mail message From Chris=A0Mills; 

When you know what you are doing, and when the bolts involved are clean
and easy to remove, the whole pull-job can take less than 30 minutes. 
We used to pull the engines in our Beetles in under 20 minutes. One
friend removing wires and cables, me removing the bolts and nuts. 
Then we'd pull the engine - allowing it to fall about 1/2&quot; onto wooden
blocks and then 3 of us would push the car up on two wheels and roll it
forward. 
Installation wasn't as slick - requiring jacks and such. 
The bus pull is easy, can be done alone, but I would suggest the help of
a friend. 
Earlier models are easier than late models. 
Which model is yours? 
The short version is: jack under the engine, disconnect the wiring,
disconnect the heater cables, disconnect the throttle, disconnect the
fuel line, remove 4 bolts/nuts on the transmission to engine joint. 
If yours is an early model you can remove the bumper and apron and
simply roll the van forward leaving the engine behind sitting on blocks. 
If yours is a late, it will require more maneuvering to get the engine
out as you cannot get the bumper and apron off of these models. 
Your solutions are: Buy Muir's Idiot book (very good basic explanations)
and a MUST have (even before Muir) is the Bentley book, skip the Haynes
book. A visit from a VW experienced friend or a visit to a local
mechanic to watch a VW engine pull. 
P-mail me if you need or want any more clarification. 
My thrust bearing is also making noises and slipping so it would be good
to do 
that at the same time, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly
appreciated. 
thanks in advance 
Your thrust bearing may be howling but it is not slipping like a clutch.
I had a van which ate 3 quickly because one of the arms had weakened and
that allowed the bearing to get off center. They'd last about 5 miles. 
Another possibility is that the throw-out bearing arm is drifting left
or right and doing the same damage. 
Ciao!
