&gt;Okay, fair enough.  The Saturn did not require any diagnostic 
&gt;equipment.  My late model Mustang which is also computer-controlled, 
&gt;requires nothing more than an understanding of the codes that are being 
&gt;sent through the flashes of the check-engine light.  A $20 book lists them 
&gt;all.  Code 87 means bad O2 sensor, code 43 means coolant temperature out 
&gt;of range, etc..  It actually makes it very easy to figure out what is wrong.


Be careful though... We chased codes on a Cavalier one time and we replaced 
$200 of parts before we discovered that the MAP sensor was bad - that code 
did not flash until the other items were replaced which of course implies 
that the other parts were defective as well. Some of them were, some were not.

A mechanic I talked to said it still took some experience to understand how 
two codes for separate problems might actually point as a third yet unnamed 
sensor.

I do prefer (more) modern systems than the '70's systems because of the 
efficiency and air pollution improvements but they take experience just 
like the vintage Bosch systems...
