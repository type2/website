Removing Type IV engine from 78 bus for first time.  It is unclear to me if the transmission must be supported while removing the engine.  What is the best method of doing this while pulling the engine back from the tranny with a floorjack?  Any suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Chad
