i am going to respray my entire body, i am sanding all the paint off of the
bottom part and painting it green , but my top doesnt have many rust spots, so
can i just sand the rust spots, and prime them, or do i have to do that to the
whole top?



sorry for all the q's lately, i just realized how close to winter it is here,
