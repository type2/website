At the risk of starting another FART, I love my Yokahama Model 370 197/75
R14.  They are M+S rated, 8 ply, Load rated D.   The Yokahama 356 are
similiar, but with highway tread instead of M+S.  A good combo would be the
370 on the rear and 356 on the front.

With these D rated tires, I can now drive my pop-top Westy straight, even
with a side wind and when monster tractor-trailers pass me on the
interstate.

I bought mine from Tire Rack 800-287-2345.  They also have a web site.

Good Luck
