John:

The hard part of getting this bearing out is just getting a hold of it.  
You'll find it comes out with some pretty gentle hits of the slide 
hammer.  Nothing to worry about.

&gt; Thanks to Weber_at_zap-net_dot_com I found out that a pilot bearing puller can
&gt; be rented for onlt $6.00 in my area.  It's one of the sliding hammer type
&gt; pullers.  I am concerned about the side loads put on the bearings (Mains
&gt; and cam that is) when the hammer transmits this sideways force to the
&gt; crankshaft during the pilot bearing pulling.  Is this a concern, or am I
&gt; tilting at windmills?
