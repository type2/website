Dave,

Sorry for not getting back to you yesterday. I have just been getting back
to business matters. First place to call is Wolfsburg Auto works. The guys
name is Mark. He is far in his pricing compared to just some regular foreign
auto repair and also knows these buses well. They open at 8 am. Next is
Verner's, 303-444-8307, these guys are very knowledgeable when it comes to
the airs as well but probably swamped. Let me know how things turn out.
These folks have access to new and used replacement parts but if they need
anything have them drop me a line. Good luck and I'll talk to you later.

Hitting it early today,
Joe Mitchell

Dear Friends, I'm in boulder, Co. Does anyone know of
a reliable and available mechanic that may be able to
help me get some tweeks out of this engine. Joe at
BustedVW has been an incredible help. There was only
so much we could do. We worked on her for the last two
days and have made some real progress. Joe stopped
everything he was doing to lend his space and time.
Its a learning experience for us both. I can't say
enough about the kind assistance I have been blessed
with at BustedVW. He has every imaginable part for the
bus. He showed me some very nicely reconditioned slide
blocks for the side door. I needed one a month ago. My
pleas were answered by a supprise package in the mail.
What incredible kindness! For anyone interested in the
future, almost any part can be located at BustedVW.
Joe is located here in Boulder. It has been so nice to
have his help, but, at this point I am in need of a
real mechanic. Is there someone I can contact here?
David 77 Westy
