&gt; I'd venture to say that 10 times outa 10, if the trans isn't operating
&gt; --or moving the 73 to 75 Bus at all in any given gear--I'd totally
&gt; discount the chances of the vacuum line leaking--

sounds about right
&gt;
&gt; I would suspect suspect either the reverse / 1st gear band is either
&gt; outa adjustment, burnt--or shot.

odds of out of adjustment is slim too,. I've never actually seen one out
of adjustment.

&gt; Just putting you nose to the fluid would be the best starting point--

yup outa tell the tail

and personally I would search out a late model 010 auto tranny from a
76-79 bus..much more reliable and it is easier to find.  but don't forget
the shifters are different so gotta get that from the donor too
