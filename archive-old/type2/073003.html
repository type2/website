Hi all,

I just bought a 74 bus that needs some servicing, well specifially it needs
valve work and it also needs to be smogged.  I'm slightly in a hurry as my
vw golf's trans. is on the blink and I'd like toget my bus running ASAP.
As such I'd like some suggestions if at all possible for a decent VW bus
repair place in the Pasadena CA area.

Many thanks,
