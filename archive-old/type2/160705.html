Subject: EB06 trip report

The trip to Everybus (EB) was uneventful.

Melissa, Emma and I drove up to DocRic's place on Wednesday for 
&quot;Howlingbus&quot; (this is a throwback to a previous year when he owned a 
beagle and no-one slept that night).  We were SUPPOSED to leave at 
Dawn's crack the next morning (yeah, right), but Jason didn't get in 
until 1 AM or so.  By the time we left, the sun was warm.  We stopped 
to eat at Bob's Dairyland in wonderful downtown Roan Mountain.  Greta 
(our dog) had lots to eat (leftover cat head biscuits).  So we had a 
carabus of three.  Stopped in Wilkesboro for groceries and got to EB by 
about 2 PM.  There were already bunches o' buses.   We brought a 
camera, but it never saw the light of day.  Jason brought a camera, so 
I daresay he will have thousands of pictures posted on his website.  
Stay tuned to type2_dot_com for the link to his pictures.

The short version:

A great time was had by all.  How many buses?  I dunno.  Not as many as 
last year, I think cuz of the rain - and Troy Wical didn't drive his 
bus.  I'll leave it to someone else to tell that story.  Friday was 
beautiful.  Saturday it rained from sunup to sundown (with some 
breaks).  A beautiful rainbow signaled the end of the rain (anybody get 
a picture?).  Saturday night an old time string band played.  This 
event was being filmed for a presentation of some kind and the 
performers (and the film crew) were blown away by the event - I don't 
think they realized what they were getting themselves in to.  the 
audience was fantastic (so was the music).

Missed it?  Too bad.

The trip home WAS eventful.

We drove west toward home (Tennessee for Jason, Ric and me).
Ric and family (that would be Teddy, who rode up with us on Thursday), 
and Tootsie and Alice (who drove up on Saturday - but not in a bus) 
peeled off a few miles down the road.
Shortly after Troy (and family) peeled off (I sure hope someone else 
expounds on the adventures of Troy), Lurch (my bus) decides to lose 
power.  We pull off in Marion (which happens to be the exact same place 
that Jason had troubles last year) and pop open the hatch.  It appears 
to Jason and I that far too many bubbles are showing up in the fuel 
filter (bad pump?), so we pour cold water on the pump and letitsit for 
a minute.  It starts right up and the fuel is flowing freely.  &quot;Bad 
fuel pump,&quot; we sing in harmony, so we get a phone book and find a FLAPS 
that has one.  As we are installing the new fuel pump, I notice that 
the fuel line isn't gushing fuel as I pull it off of the filter.  
Hmmmm...  I blow with all my might into the end of the fuel line and 
out spews gas.  &quot;It wasn't the fuel pump after all,&quot; we sing, and we 
delight in the fact that we have a spare fuel pump - just in case.   
Sooo... we motor on our way and make it as far as the next exit.  Lurch 
is STILL missing badly.  What to do ...  what to do.

We pop open the hatch and see all appears to be flowing normally.  I 
drive it down the road (up a hill - because we will son be climbing 
Back Mountain and we want to see how it will do under load) and the 
engine behaves badly.  We do the spark plug wire test and find that 
RPMs don't change when #2 is pulled.  We pull the spark plug out and it 
looks fine.  We do a compression test and even though its about 95, we 
call it OK because all the other spark plugs are in.  We remove the 
compression tester, only to find that the adapter on the end of it 
stayed in the engine.  By this time, I am using colorful language.  We 
try and try and try to get the adapter back out when we realize that we 
didn't pull #2 plug - we pulled #1!  By now the expletives are flowing 
freely.  We finally get the adapter out and make sure all is right with 
#1 before pulling #2.  WTF?!?!  The electrode gap for #2 is 
nonexistent!  We fix that and get everything running right again.  OK.  
Good to go.  Make it as far as the next exit which is a rest area 
another mile down the road.  We go to the back of Lurch and scratch our 
heads because we can't think of anything else.  We head out again, only 
this time Lurch quits altogether.  My wife, Melissa, calls AAA.  We 
coast backwards to the rest area again.  I pull the fuel line from the 
pump inlet and my suspicions are confirmed:  Clogged again.  We start 
draining the fuel out of the tank, but it is going sooooo sloooow.  The 
flatbed shows up and so we acquiesce to the fact that it is getting 
dark and we are still a long way from home.

When we get to Knoxville about midnight we are informed by the Laster 
clan that they will not be able to make the haul for another 4 hours to 
Dickson and so 20 minutes later they pull in and the kids (most of them 
anyway) go straight to bed.

Fast forward to today:

I call in sick and go to work on Lurch.  Draining the fuel tank is 
still going slow so I jack the right side up, pull the wheel, and 
remove the connection at the bottom of the fuel tank, using a BIG LONG 
funnel to direct the fuel to a container.  There was still quite a bit 
in there.  When I had the engine out in December (see previous post 
about broken crankshaft), I did not find the fuel screen filter, but 
sure enough, it was in there - I just had to use some &quot;special tools&quot; 
to remove it.  I got lots of chunder out of the tank, and removing the 
fuel lines and blowing through them didn't reveal any more blockage so 
I put everything back together.  It runs fine now.  In retrospect, I 
may have been able to forge ahead had I filled the tank all the way up 
(I had more than 1/4 tank at the time).  Hindsight is always 20/20.  
Anyway, we had a good time yacking it up with the tow truck lady.

Thanks to all - especially Jason (faster) Laster.  Thanks for reading 
this (if you got this far).
