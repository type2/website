Hi Everyone,
    I was at BBTT ( very nice event, thank you Karl &amp; Kristina ) this 
weekend, and sometime Saturday an older gentleman ( I know he drives an '84, 
beige, and he's from New Jersey) stopped by my campsite to chat. He had a 1.8 
engine he was looking to get rid of, and I told him thanks, but no thanks. 
Now I may be interested in it. He told me he does not get on the internet, so 
if anyone knows how to contact him, please let me know. I can't even remember 
his name. TIA, Jeff S.
