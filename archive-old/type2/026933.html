Hey, I'm stoked because we're heading out to Yuma Saturday at the 
crack-o-dawn to pick up my new $611.99 ebay Westy. Running 1600 SP, complete 
clean interior minus stool, needs 2 windows, ignition switch and battery. A 
deal? I'll know in 2 days.

One question (the first in a potentially long list of many, I'm sure)

What does the rear tin look like on this one? Rear meaning the wide piece 
closest to the apron.

Heater hoses pass though, any other cut-outs?

And does it have the raised area with the raised half-circle pieces which go 
around the heat risers? (my '67, with 1500 SP has this)

Just wondering, I may need this piece.

Thanks, and if you see a White F*_at_d Explosion towing a white Westy hardtop 
up the 405 on Saturday, give us a honk!

Jason
