Subject: RE: [T2] 1971 Kick Panels

&gt; I remember someone in Portland, Oregon awhile
&gt; back had some nice black kick panels for the bus


Well, not being an Oregonian I can't claim to be that person. But this looks
like a good excuse to mention my &quot;better than stock&quot; kick panels.

Rather than a vinyl wrap over pressboard (like the originals, and the TMI
replacements sold everywhere else), I import European made replacements made
of black ABS plastic.  They look basically the same but hold up MUCH better.
They won't peel, fray in the corners, or disintigrate if they get damp.  And
at $49.95 for the pair, they're cheaper too.
