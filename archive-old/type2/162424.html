&gt; I was wondering if there is a way of torquing type 4 heads without dropping the

officially no.  but I have done it

you need a long extension for your torque wrench/socket.

remove the tin over the cyl you need.
bend the tin out of the way enough to slide your extended socket torque
wrench into the space created.
sweat curse etc.
when done try to get the tin bent back into the exacty spot it was in
before and tighten.  easier on 3-4 side than on 1-2 side because of the
alternator.

REMEMBER I did not reccomend this and you do so at your own risk, but in a
pinch it does work.
