Hey folks,

This weekend will be the big engine AND tranny swap from a 70 into a 69.

Both Bentley and Haynes say to detach the axles at the tranny and pull both 
engine and tranny at once and then separate.

Is this really easier?

I want to swap the tranny drum to drum.

Would it be that much more difficult to remove the engine then do the tranny 
with axles on?

I have a floor jack and plywood to support the engine. Pulling both at once 
might be too cumbersome. Though I do have a buddy helping.

Thoughts?

Jason
