&gt; Here's another thought on the oil Jello additives.
&gt;
&gt; Ever seen the Lucas displays on a parts counter--the three spinning
&gt; wheels that you can crank to see how the Lucas jello will climb &amp; say up
&gt; on the gear's?
&gt;
&gt; Imagine what the Jello will do for you engine.
&gt; It's county fair Flim Flam in a bottle.


if it were any good Mobil, Pennzoil, et al would be selling it.  what
they are selling is top of the line quality synthetic lubricant. Mobil
1 is getting $7 a qt/l  and the other guys the same, if it didn't cost
em a bunch more to be making this stuff do you think they wouldn't be
under cutting each other on the price.

when you get a new rebuild they tell you to use regular dino oil for
the first 3000 miles or so, there is a reason, the sythetics lubricate
so well the engine will never seat it self or hone the pistons in.

oil is the blood of your engine (Bus blood) why spend $$$$ doin a top
of the line rebuild and then using 99cent bargin bin oil in it.

my bus gets ALL synthetics oil, tranny fluid, even brake fluid and
grease and all from the big guys.... and I (knock on wood) have never
had a lubrication caused failure in over 25 years since Mobil 1 first
came out.  have enough other problems don't need lube problems.

even got over 100,000 miles out of a GEX crank !!! (maybe dumb luck)
