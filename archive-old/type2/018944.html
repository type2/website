&gt; Hello all.  
&gt; I have a two part question.  I have recently installed
&gt; a pre 67 upright motor in my 72 westie to replace the
&gt; original pancake.  I remember some time back hearing
&gt; about somebody who made a fiberglass? piece of trim to
&gt; seal up the engine compartment.  Does anybody out
&gt; there know where this can be found(or have any
&gt; suggestions about how to take care of this issue)?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the bus had sat for about a year before I put in
&gt; this new motor and I believe that the gas tank is
&gt; corroded.  I am definately learning from my mistakes
&gt; here.  I figure that I will have to pull the motor
&gt; again, get the tank out for some kind of service.  I
&gt; used a product once in a motorcycle that was a three
&gt; step process of chemicals that cleaned and then sealed
&gt; the tank.  Has anybody used anything like this in
&gt; their VW tank?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for your help!!!
