&lt;&lt; Yeah, I'm on a trip, so I'm stuck in the hotel room watching Speed Vision,

and I noticed on &quot;My Classic Car&quot;, Jay Leno and Phineas Gage were cruising

around an a car called a 1915 Hispanic Suazo or something. It had an

electric oil pump that primed the system before they started it. It

basically went in-line with the mechanical oil pump and functioned until the

car started. &gt;&gt;

Hispano Suiza...If you want to see another, rent Billy Wilder's &quot;Sunset
Blvd.&quot;...It's the car Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) owns and the 
studio wants to rent... Quite the machine in its time...
