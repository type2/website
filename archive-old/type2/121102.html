&gt; (2) The throttle vacuum from the throttle housing on the left carb and 
&gt; runs to the distributor vacuum canister, and it is retard vacuum.   When 

I don't know too much about carbs, but it sounds like you have your 
vacuum advance/retard lines backwards.  The vacuum line that goes to the 
throttle body should go to vacuum advance.


&gt; the VW is idling, there is minimal (none) vacuum, partly because the 
&gt; throttle plate covers the tiny hair-sized hole at the inside of the 
&gt; throttle housing.  Trying to suction some air through the green tube, 

There is not supposed to be any advance vacuum at idle.  The way that 
the vacuum advance works is when the throttle is *cracked* open.  When 
the throttle plate opens just a little, the hole is exposed to a vacuum, 
and then advances the timing.  This helps the engine speed up.


&gt; But what is the function of the throttle vacuum in the case of  'timing 
&gt; the VW'  It does not seem to give much vacuum at idle (no massive air 
&gt; flow past throttle at idle, and throttle plate covers hole) so the 
&gt; retard on the distributor is not effective.  No throttle vacuum.  Should 
&gt; I just remove both vacuum hoses on the distributor and time it at 7.5 
&gt; BTDC??  It seems to like it there...  Faster idle, and all.

Again, there is no vacuum at idle on the *advance* line.  This is why 
the Bentley has you check the timing at different speeds and with the 
vacuum advance line connected and disconnected.  One is to check the 
centrifugal advance, and the other is to test the total advance, 
including the vacuum advance.  Don't just disconnect the lines, then 
you'll just mimic an 009 and get crappy performance (oh... did I say 
that ;).  Get it working right and you'll be a happy camper!

granted, this could be totally different on a carbed bus, so ymmv, 
however it's great to see that you're trying to figure this out. 
Knowing what's going on helps a ton!
