Subject: Re: [T2] dist/diaphram (78 auto tranny)

well I think I found the problem with my 78.  the dist diaphram must have
a small hole. it will pull the advance plate maybe halfway then slowly
goes back to start even if the vacuum is held..

??? anyone sell diaphrams??
or distributors for a 78 auto tranny stock.???

being typically bus driver cheap just the diaphram would be preferred but
whatever.  gots lots of stuff I can trade, or even part with money if I
have to.

guess I grab an .009 to at least get her back on the road for now.... but
looked I don't even have one of those.... mumble mumble mumble

thanks
Bob
