Subject: Bus tow bar needed ASAP

Hello all,

I know this subject has been covered in the past, but I need to haul my bus 
&gt;from one end of the country to the other.

YES I know that I would have to disconnect the drive shafts to save the 
tranny.

I have actually seen some towbars for buses out West but they looked more 
home-fabricated.  So my question is: Does anyone have one or know of one for 
sale on the East coast? Preferably in MD, PA, or NY state.

FYI: To rent a car carrier from U-Haul, oh how I loathe their name, coast to 
coast right now  it costs 800 bucks and a tow dolly is 400 bucks.  They are 
the only company who will rent one without their own trucks that I could 
find.

ANY SUGGESTIONS would be welcome.

Thanks,

Jeffrey
