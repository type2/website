Subject: [T2] Re: Westy tent set up ?

Asketh Jody Drew &lt;jldrew_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;:

&gt; I have a new old westy tent, yellow walls, blue roof, stripped awning, very
&gt; pretty.  It's in the living room right now as I try to assemble it for the
&gt; first time.  Can anyone on the list &quot;talk&quot; me through the set up?
&gt; My first three attempts have resulted in 1950's cartoon style tents, I'm
&gt; giggling and stumped.  There are 4 obvious bottom legs and 4 obvious corner
&gt; pieces then 9 straight pieces tapered on one end, then 2 bent T pieces.
&gt; Thanks in advance and feel free to heckle me.

Heckle, heckle. ;-)  You should try setting up an even earlier
awning-style tent when you've never even seen one before!

Jody, I think we discussed this via p-mail, but the drawing at
http://www.village_dot_org/vw/tents/tent1.jpg and
http://www.village_dot_org/vw/tents/pole1.jpg should help you with the pole
setup.  Sounds like you may be missing one of the tapered pieces, but of
all the poles those are probably the easiest to replace via some
homebrew method using electrical conduit or pipe.

I set it up in this order:

- construct the top frame (the two squares) from the four corners, two
tees, and ten tapered poles.  (Six of the tapered poles are made into
three connected pairs, which go front to back (front = awning) between
the corners and between the tees.  The long legs on the corner pieces
point towards the tees; the other two legs point toward the other corner
and down.)

- now put the telescoping poles into the downward-facing legs of the
tees so the whole frame is sitting off the ground, about four feet.

- next, unfold the tent under the frame (I lay a cheap tarp down first
to protect the floor).  Note that the top of the frame is not perfectly
level: if the telescoping legs are of equal length, the frame will lean
slightly.  It should lean toward the bus.  (The tees and corners are not
perfectly identical - you can see the difference in angle of the legs
that face inward-outward.  The pole picture says the bus-side ones are
color-coded Red but yours may not have the color codes.)  The idea is
that when you raise the tent hanging from the frame, the side toward the
bus is going to be a little higher than the awning side.

- once things are oriented, hang the tent from the frame, paying
attention to Detail A in the drawing.  If any plastic hooks or rubber
loops are broken, make a note (I bought a few steel S hooks to replace
the palstic hooks).  Get all the hooks/loops in place, then raise the
telescoping poles to extend the tent.  I put the telescoping pole's foot
in the corner loop at the bottom of the tent and raise the canvas until
it's reasonably taut.  Check all around for evenness.  Look inside the
tent and if the floor's wrinkled see if you can move the poles around a
bit to even it out.

- the tent should be right up next to the bus, with the leading edge of
the bus-side door just forward of the leading edge of the sliding door
opening.

- last, I unzip the bus-side door, roll it up, and tie it off.  Open the
sliding door carefully, into the diagonal &quot;pocket&quot;.  Attach the plastic
strip to the rain gutter on the bus (a pain until you get the technique
figured); hook the two small hooks at the bottom of the opening into
holes underneath the jack points and stretch the boot out front and rear
by hooking to stakes, bumpers, whatever.  Bungees can be helpful here. 
What you want is a relatively gap-free boot connection.

- optional: stakes, guy ropes at the four corners, and use the small
remaining two-piece poles and guy ropes to set up the awning.  I hardly
ever do any of that.

Kinda offhand, but I hope it helps.
