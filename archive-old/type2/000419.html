Just Kampers was mentioned on the list last week, while I was in Europe.
Coincidentally, one of the reasons I went to Europe was to talk with them.
They are looking to increase their buying &quot;clout&quot; and need someone who could
help them do that by significantly augmenting their ordering quantities.
It's a win-win situation: We get parts that are hard to find in the U.S.,
and they get better wholesale pricing on the parts they need because their
purchasing volume goes up.  I will be bringing in some of these parts, with
the first shipment arriving in about 10 days. The price will of course be
lower than if you bought the item from them, especially considering that you
will not have to pay shipping from England.  We are buying by the container
load so the shipping cost is relatively low. One example is installation
kits for fitting a 1600 engine to a '72-79 bus, a commonplace item there
that was never offered here in the U.S.  I'll have a list ready in a few
days.
