Subject: Re: GL5/Synthetics

I guess everybody has a different story when it comes to the use of 
synthetics. I use Redline 75w-90 in my transaxle, and Mobile 1 15w-50 in my 
eng. Both are synthetic based oils, and the Redline is GL-4. My rig is a ' 78 
2.0L FI Westy, with 127k original miles, on the original eng./trans. I'm the 
second owner. The first put 52k on her before selling to me. I immedatly 
switched over to the above mentioned lubes, without so much as a hint of a 
problem. No leaks, no clutch shudder, no nothing. Just a tranny that shifts 
like a hot knife thru butter, even at -13f, and an eng. that still tests at 
137psi all around, with a leak-down of less than 7% per cyl. I tend to push 
this machine to it's limits( my shift point is between 3700-4100rpm, and I'll 
push 75mph on the hi-way.)Prolonged oil temps of 240-260 don't even faze me. 
75k later, I'd say synthetics pay off.
FWIW,
