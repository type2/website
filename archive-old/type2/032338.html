&gt; Subject:  High cost of Q-pads
&gt; Automobile manufacturers and body shops use Q-pads almost exclusively for 
&gt; one reason: no cheaper solution works.  Tear back the trunk carpeting in 
&gt; your Jetta, look at the floor of your Golf, look under the carpeting in a 
&gt; Honda, a Ford, a Chevy, even the lowliest model of Toyota has Q-pads on the 
&gt; floor. They work, and if car companies could find a less expensive 
&gt; solution, they would be using it.

--&gt; I'm betting, though, they don't pay nearly what we do for the same
stuff.  They probably get it in big rolls or something, for a tenth what
we pay...but their sources probably aren't accessable to the average Joe.
I've found there's usually two prices for this kind of stuff -- and
anything aimed at car stereo installations gets marked up heavily.
