Subject: Re: [T2] Coil Question again

&gt; My Bus (72 with 76 drivetrain - FI 2000) is STILL
&gt; having trouble. I searched the archives and found
&gt; someone with the exact symptoms, but only them with
&gt; these symptoms. No other listings. 

Was it me?  It sure sounds like me.  Summer 2003... nothing like
camping in the driveway at the mechanic's house.

&gt; coil going bad: Runs fine, then sometimes looses power at higer
&gt; RPM's and under load (going up a hill).  Then it will
&gt; be fine again, run well for a while, then back to a
&gt; lose of power at higher RPM's. Plus it will stall out
&gt; when the it's acting up. All the lights and radio work
&gt; fine. Starter cranking fine. The timing is fine. I've
&gt; just had a tune up and the distributor rebuilt. These
&gt; symptoms was starting to reveal itself before this.
&gt; But it's getting worse. 

Anyway, does it pop and burp seemingly at random and then run fine? 
Fortunately, a new coil isn't that spendy when you're able to shop for
it, so swap a new one in there.  If it doesn't fix the problem, there's
plenty of reason to carry a spare.

Good luck,

Paul Manning
