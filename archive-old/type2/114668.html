Subject: Re: [T2] Replace Heater/Vent levers 68-71

Hiya Todd,

The levers with the red and blue knobs, right?

The old ones simply slide out to the rear (RIR), through the dash, AFTER the 
little white plastic rivets have been cut away.  Save the leaf spring which 
holds each lever in place.  Then with the leaf spring still in place simply 
replace from the rear, through the dash with a new lever/knob.  Forget the rivet, 
the leaf spring will keep the new lever/knob in place.

I did all this without ever touching the radio or the glove box.
