Subject: Type 4 Engine 

I have a type 4 long block from a '73 VW Bus that I no longer have a
need for.  It is a used engine and the PO (who has been a VW fanatic 
for about 20 years) said it has about 6000 miles on it after his rebuild.
The bus that it came from had an automatic transmission.  Anyway, I now
own a '71 Bus and am looking for a reasonable trade.  I live in NC (close
to Raleigh) and cannot ship this thing so you will need to pick it up here.
I could perhaps deliver within a 200 mile radius of Raleigh for the 
right trade.  So, if anyone has a nice type 1 engine, or some parts or
tools, etc etc that they would like to trade for a type 4 engine, p-mail me.

'71 Hardtop (not a pop top) camper.  Kind of like shaken, not stirred.
