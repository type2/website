Subject: Re: [T2] '74 Start No Run

Hi Herb,

It may be the ignition switch, or it could be the ignition barrel. 
There is no ignition relay in a 74 bus unless added by a previous 
owner. But the wiring is very simple, and you can find a color wiring 
diagram for your bus at www.vintagebus_dot_org.

You can find the take-apart instructions for the ignition barrel here:

http://www.specialpatrolgroup.co_dot_uk/spooky/barrel/barrel.html

Question: Is your bus fuel injected? (1974 CA buses were FI) If so then 
it could be a problem with the airflow meter or the double-relay.

Happy trails,

&gt; My '74 played an interesting game with me today. I died without 
&gt; warning once at a busy intersection. Messed with everything I could 
&gt; think of and finally discovered it was something faulty in the 
&gt; ignition switch/relay.
&gt;
&gt; As soon as I release the key from the start position the circuit is 
&gt; opened and the engine dies. If I hold the key in the start position it 
&gt; will run fine.
&gt;
&gt; Questions: Is the problem most likely the ignition switch or a relay I 
&gt; have not located that I hear clicking? How difficult it is to remove 
&gt; the ignition switch if that is the problem? Anyone know what the relay 
&gt; looks like?
