&gt; OK, now HERE'S a neat thing for Mr. Casting Fool to make, and sell for
&gt; $10-$15...
&gt; A radio BLOCK OFF plate!!

Okay, the karma's getting a little bit thick here.

I'd just looked at the neat glove compartment unit that Richard posted a
link to, and thought (as I'm just getting ready to install my own radio and
was dreading cutting the factory radio hole bigger), that that was a neat
idea, especially as I could cast a plate to fill in the hole in the dash...

Okay, now that Barry's freaked me out, what's the consensus? :O)

Do we want a plate that's sort of flat and recessed into the radio
depression, or one that's flush with the outer surface of the dash??  Does
it need to completely fit the hole without any gap between it and the dash,
or does it need to sort of mimic the stock radio and have a small gap
between it and the dash rimming the hole?  Should it have a rim bordering
the edge of the plate to give it definition?

The resin is easily drilled, sanded, tapped, etc., so mounting anything in
it should work well.  I'd probably go with a thickness of 1/8&quot; to 3/16&quot; to
give switches/gauges some bite for mounting.  It would be possible to make
the plate so that it presents a vertical surface for mounting (rather than
having the switch/gauge facing up as it would in a flat plate), but this
might limit the size of the switch/gauge that could be mounted in the plate.

Do dashes come in any other color than black?  (Newbie question, sorry.)
