Subject: &quot;It's a miracle.  Engine heals itself&quot;

Hi Folks,

Last month I sent a woeful story about my new (7K) Mexi engine coming up with low compression (85) in the #3 cylinder.  I've been preparing to make a trip to Oregon to get the problem taken care of under warranty, but I thought that before I went, I should do another (third) test.  Good thing.  This time the compression was back to 110, where it's been since the engine was first put in.

Anyone care to speculate on what's going on?  (I've got this bizarre theory that a valve sticks occasionally, which would account for the little puffs of smoke I get out of the exhaust from time to time, but I don't have the mechanical knowledge to make a rational case for that argument.)

See you on the road,
Jerry
