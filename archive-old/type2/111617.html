Subject: Re: [T2] RE: tuned exhaust

&gt;When the muffler on the extractor that came w/ my bus rotted out I &gt;tried to get&gt;a replacement extractor system, but all I got from the vwflaps was an &gt;EMPI&gt;extractor that leaked at the welds :(I have the extractor with an EMPI single quiet pack and I must say that this is the biggest piece of sh*t muffler set up I have ever used.  ('72-'74 style)I am on my second muffler in 3500miles.  The welds broke on the first one in less than a 1000 miles, the second now has come apart on the muffler seam where it is tack welded.  So what ever you do, stay away from Empi.  Actually, every EMPI product that I have used in the last couple of years has worn out or broken in a VERY short time making their products worthless in my book!I have heard that BugPack has purchased S&amp;S headers, or maybe the other way around...and I think they have a stronger product.So, I too, am thinking of going back to stock.Pablo
