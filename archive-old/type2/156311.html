&gt; I have some camper interior that came with the 68 I recently
&gt; purchased. I want to reinstall it but it is all in pieces. I have two
&gt; questions, that may certainly lead to more. . .
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is there somewhere I can look to see how this stuff goes back in
&gt; or is it going to be trial and error for me?

I believe the '68 thru '72 (maybe '73?) Westy interior is in the
Bentley.  The Z-bed is pretty straighforward.  IIRC, the only tricky
bit for me was getting it flat on the floor.  The wood floor height (if
you throw out the original) needs to be higher than just the bare steel
floor.
If the Z-bed is from a different year, things get interesting.  IIRC,
the '74/75 is a wider bed, and '76-'79 assumes the cabinet is on the
LH-side not the right.

&gt; 2. The ply-wood that (I assume) is the base for the zBed is all moldy
&gt; and I would like to have a frame welded out of aluminum tubing as a
&gt; new support as it won't promote more rust and it won't mold, How
&gt; should go about finding accurate dimensions and options?
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.

The only thought I'd have is in regards to getting it to fit properly
after you've modified it.  You could just replace the plywood with
fresh wood, but it sounds like you have a larger scope in mind.

Good Luck,
