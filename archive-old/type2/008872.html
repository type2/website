Dear list-
	A buddy of mine needs a 1600 DP for his 69 westy.  We went to the
obvious salvage yards here in Albuquerque and all they have are cores
with no real life in the engines left.  Does anybody have a spare 1600
laying around the shop for sale.  His old engine spun a bearing and
instead of spending time rebuilding it he perfers to just get a used
engine. So he can get leave town.  

Thanks in advance

Chuck
