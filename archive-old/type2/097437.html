Subject: 71 Bus for sale - prolly cheap. Portland OR

I was contacted recently by a lady, stating that she wanted her name removed
from the AIRS list. She then went on to say that her Ex-husband had put their
contact info on the list but that he had walked out on them a while back,
leaving his bus &quot;rotting in the driveway&quot;. She was tired of being contacted by
AIRS members, when she had no clue about buses. I mailed back and I told her
I'd remove her name, and if shed like, I could put the word out if she wanted
to sell her husbands bus. She mailed me back saying yes please do.
So here is what she said about it:

&quot;It's pretty beat up and currently not running- but it has a nice stereo! I
guess it had great compression when it did run. My ex was trying to fine tune
things before he left. It has a funky custom &quot;sun-roof&quot; and I guess it's a '71
kombi.&quot;

Dont know if she has a title or what, didnt ask. Contact her if you want more
details or are interested. Her email is aegc_at_spiritone_dot_com and she lives in
Portland Oregon. Just tell her the AIRS webmaster sent you.

 It was Andy connelly's old bus if anyone knows who that is.  That name sounds
familiar for some reason...old type2 listmember?
