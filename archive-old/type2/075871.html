Subject: Re: [T2] '72 rebuild sat for 3 yrs...what's it worth?

I'd definately guess its value at around 800$ if you don't have to give
them a core.
Rebuilt heads are about 195$ each plus freight. The case is worth 250$ if
the oil drain plug and engine mounting bosses arent stripped out. A
gasket set on head job is about 40$.
It has the assembly lube on the bearings so they'll be OK and if its been
stored in a dry location it should be just fine.

Offer them about six hundred and if they don't throw you out you can
always go up a little.

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at a motor that had the heads rebuilt 3
&gt; yrs back and the guy never came to pick it up.  the
&gt; shop has had it since.  they are reputable guys in the
&gt; bay area (ca).  figuring they would not have bothered
&gt; if the engine was not sound, would anyone like to
&gt; estimate a value to the motor sightunseen? and is
&gt; sitting for 3 years without oil in it a bad thing?  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Shawn
