Subject: Re: [T2] where is this oil coming from?

You going to have to clean than engine and everything around it (spray
engine cleaner works good).
Then you're going to have to lay down under it and what to see what
happens and where the oil is coming from.
#1, Check the oil sender.
#2. Check your valve covers.
Thats all I can advise you on the 1600......... I don't have one so I can
only direct you towards the simple things.

&gt; Ok, put the oil cooler in with new seals..... new points, got the 
&gt; timing
&gt; set.... all is running fine.... except for the small trail of oil 
&gt; when
&gt; running down the road, and the puddle of oil when stopped for any 
&gt; reason....
&gt; be it stop light or whatever....
&gt; Does any one have any idea where it could be coming from.  When I 
&gt; check the
&gt; oil before pouring more in... it is on the bottom mark on the dip 
&gt; stick..
&gt; (1600DP engine).
