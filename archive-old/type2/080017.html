Hello, i'm really new to the whole vw world, i've been wanting to get a =
bus ever since i can remember and finally picked about a month ago. It's =
a '77 standard that i got for $200. It runs almost perfect the body is =
straight with very little rust, good tires breaks etc. basically decent =
throughout (but not even close to perfect). I have a lot of small things =
that need to be done (and some bigger things), and could use a little =
help. My most prominent problem is that I took the instrument cluster =
apart about a week ago and i wrote down what wires went where, but my =
dog thought it would make a great chew toy, and so now i have no idea =
how to put everything back together. I've tried dinking around to see if =
i could somehow maybe &quot;accidentally&quot; figure it out, but have had no =
luck. The whole wiring setup is a total mess anyway, and so basically i =
want to completely re-do all of the wiring (wires are cut and taped and =
glued and going every which way). Is there anywhere that I can find a =
good wiring schematic to be able to figure out what should go where. I'm =
pretty good with wiring and electrical, but most of the wires dead-end =
and don't go anywhere, and there are also holes all over the dash where =
there obviously used to be various conrols for god knows what, is there =
someplace i could find pictures maybe of what the dash is supposed  to =
look like? That would really help me out a lot. It's hard to fix =
something when you don't know what needs to be fixed. Also, would easier =
(or worth the price) to just take it in and have someone who really =
knows what they're doing do it? Any thoughts would be greatly =
appreciated. Also, one last thing, this is just a standard, but i've =
always wanted a westy, there is nothing inside the bus right now except =
the two front seats, otherwise everything in back is completely =
stripped, how easy or hard would it be to convert into a westy type =
interior? and how hard would it be to find the equipment? Again, i'm =
still new to the wonderfull world of vw, so these might be pretty stupid =
questions, but i didn't know how else to get them answered, so i thought =
i would try here first. Thanks!

Jesse
