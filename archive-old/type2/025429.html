About 2 or three years ago there was a link in the Features section of
www.type2_dot_com that had an exstensive article about and English fellow that
removed the upper three inches from a donor 1970s crewcab and welded into
his bus to repair the rusted out section of windsheild frame. I would really
like to find this page if it still exists! I have searched the archives but
have not found it yet.

I have found an interesting bus for sale the really needs this repair done
to make a pleasureable drive.

If you have done this type of repair I would like to hear from you about
your experiences.
