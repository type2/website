Subject: '74 cooling fan ignition timing marks

I cannot for the life of me, find the Timing marks on the air blower at the
back of the motor.  I have #1 ATDC, and the distributor rotor alignment is
where I think it is supposed to be from data in Bently, Muir, VW.  There seem
to be 3 &quot;small depressions&quot; on the outside edge of the airfan perimeter, with
a small piece of metal wedged between the outer and inner rings on same,
adjacent to where the fan belt is supposed to ride  Are these the ones I am
searching for on my 1800 '74 Carbbed motor, to be able to do the timing
correctly?
