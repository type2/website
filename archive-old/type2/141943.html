&gt;I was seeing 500 degrees at 60 mph on a 75 
&gt;degree day.  Needless to say this really freaked me out after spending 
&gt;$850 on my heads and taking a great deal to time to set compression 
&gt;correctly.  I've since concluded that either these temperatures either 
&gt;normal or the gauge is not terribly accurate.

That's what I concluded about those gauges. I real temp gauge should read 340-380F at 60mph.

&gt;I used a sophisticated 
&gt;Raytek infrared heat sensor to measure head temperature at #3 spark 
&gt;plug and got around 420 when the VDO read 500. Lots of people told me 
&gt;that the Raytek number was bogus die to emissivity issues etc.

Only if the emissivity is not near the 0.95 those guns are rated at.

&gt;I also 
&gt;screwed around with air fuel mixture.  When I enriched the mixture to 
&gt;get the 60 mph CHT under 400 I was getting less than 8 mpg and the bus 
&gt;ran like crap at idle.

You are probably washing gasoline into the crankcase as well when you do that.

&gt;So far I've put over 4000 miles on these heads and compression remains 
&gt;good.  My recommendations are to use the VDO CHT as a trend indicator 
&gt;only.

Or get an accurate gauge from Dakota Digital.
