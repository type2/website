Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0 Injection problem

Logan

Sounds like a mild lean miss. Begins after the rich start-up time is over. 
T4's tend to run lean. What do your plugs and tail pipe look like?

With no EGR your engine tends to run leaner. Also if the &quot;disconnected&quot; EGR 
is leaking air you will run leaner for sure. Block it at the air manifold 
EGR port as well as at the sample port.

I back off a degree on my stock distributor idle timing (7.5 to 6.5 BTDC) to 
compensate for no EGR. It makes me feel better.

Vacuum leaks in the brake assist line.

Intermittent fuel pump dropout, double relay. Should measure approx 60 ohms 
to ground from pin 36 on the the mass flow sensor cable. 100 ohms is way too 
high. This relay resistor can be replaced. BTW fuel pressure does make a 
difference.

Misadjusted C0 (top of the mass flow sensor). Try a turn clockwise for 
effect.  If this helps follow up with a gas analyzer idle alignment.

Also I found a non stock muffler caused a leaner running condition.

I am sure there are many other possibilities.  Hope these help.

&gt;Date: Sun, 19 May 2002 20:08:02 -0600
&gt;
&gt;I have a problem with my westy that Ive been trying to
&gt;fix for 5 years. (its just a pain, not too bad)
&gt;
&gt;For the first few minutes after a cold start it runs
&gt;fine (you can mat it and the power is constant and
&gt;clean). After a few minutes it hesitates at low rpm
&gt;high load (any gear same condition). At high RPM and
&gt;lower load, it doenst seem to hesitate (miss?).  It
&gt;misses intermittantly while idling.  Runs great, does
&gt;not use oil, decent gas mileage (better than my solex'd
&gt;71)
&gt;
&gt;List of things Ive tested very well:
&gt;-Reset timing.
&gt;-Changed Condenser/Coil/points/wires/plugs/rotor
&gt;-Replaced Air filter (seems to make it somewhat better)
&gt;
&gt;-Sealed up all vacuum lines/replaced lines and tie
&gt;wrapped in place.
&gt;-Tried another ECU.
&gt;-Oil pressure is fine
&gt;-Checked Temp sensor (volt/ohmmeter).
&gt;-Replaced Fuel filter
&gt;-Clutch (mechanic told me the seal was leaking and
&gt;hesitation was due to the clutch was slipping)
&gt;-EGR disconnected (by previous owner) mechanical valve
&gt;position makes no difference.
&gt;
&gt;Things I have checked reasonably well:
&gt;-Mass flow sensor seems fine (volt/ohmmeter tested)
&gt;-Auxilary air regulator (tested seals and opens)
&gt;-Cold start injector makes no difference connected or
&gt;not.
&gt;-System voltage (stable no battery problems either)
&gt;-Wiring harness connectors, grounds
&gt;
&gt;Things I have not checked since I dont think they will
&gt;make a difference
&gt;-Fuel pressure
&gt;-Injector output rates
&gt;
&gt;I keep trying to think what would cause this after a
&gt;few minutes of driving (in winter I can almost get 4
&gt;miles before it starts).
&gt;Help??!!
&gt;Many thanks

&gt;10W30 for winter driving, break out the block heater!
