Subject: Re: [T2] installation of a stereo

I'm afraid the question is a bit vague.  Could you be more specific about 
which aspects of this task you're finding a challenge?  Thanks.

	Eron

&gt;I own a 1972 westy and I can not find anyone who knows how to install a car
&gt;stereo in it. I wouldn't think that it would be that hard but I just cant
&gt;figure it out. If anyone knows what the easiest way might be I would
&gt;appriciate it if they could explain. Thanks
