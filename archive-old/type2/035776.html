Subject: ohm meter/coil question [followup]

Hi, Folks:

Re: my post about checking my coil with an ohm meter: 
Andy and John asked if I zeroed the ohm meter out 
before taking the measurements--I did [thanks again to 
Daniel Simmons!].  It's a good point, though, since 
with a difference that small [1.7 - 2.1 ohms versus 3 
ohms], the error you get from not zeroing the thing out 
could easily account for it. [And I am a multimeter 
beginner.]

Also, since the last post I've checked the spark plug 
wires too, and they're all right around 1,000 ohms.  
Chilton says 35,000 ohms is about the upper limit 
before replacing the wires [50,000 means definitely 
replace].  Is 1,000 safely in range, then?  [If this is 
too much of a no-brainer, let me know off-list and I'll 
drop a note back to the list later so we won't clog the 
works up.]

Meanwhile, we live and learn.  Really hate that part.  
Why couldn't we just live and smugly already know?

thanks
