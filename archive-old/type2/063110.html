Subject: Support trani

I've always supported the transmission on post '67 transporters when taking out
the engine.  There is a forward support but I don't know of any rear support (
have I been missing something ??)  I used to support with a rope or strap tied
to the frame on each side, but now have a length of chain and some screw-links.
On the Pre-68 busses the transmission stayed put and didn't need any support.
I guess you could let the whole thing drop down, but it seems to me that the
angle would be hard to work with.   John Jensen in Annapolis
