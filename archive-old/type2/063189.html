Subject: Gas leak SUCCESS!!

Thanks to everyone outthere for their help!!  The vapor recover line on   
the passenger side of my 74 westie was cracked and not connected!  Put a   
new hose on it and I am loading up to go to Hanging Dog national Park to   
a bus event and it looks like good weather!  Only took a hour but when   
you are trying to go some where it seems longer.  So thanks again and I'm   
off to the  mountains of Western NC.  If anyone else is going I hope to   
see you there!
