Subject: friday~zits

ok, i know you guys were talking about this last week, but i finally had
something of my own to add. i went to see my grandparents sunday,
following your discussion. i believe it was said that they dont have it
running yet??? well, my grandmother has been saving the DAILY funnies for
the last month because she knows i love VWs and she saw that the boys in
zits are working on a VW bus! HOW SWEET IS MY GRANDMA??? anyway, in the
black and white daily paper, they have it running... poorly, but
running... and it is HILARIOUS!!!

i will be scanning them some time soon... probably after i mail out the
newsletter for our local VW club. havent even started on it yet and i
like to have it out 2 weeks before our meeting... that would be
TOMORROW!!! i better get busy. i'll scan the strips in a few days, then i
will post them somewhere... any ideas? do we have a place already where
we have been putting these things? i have one color one from a long time
ago, saved to my harddrive on 6-19-01, according to my pc... odd.

anyway, they are so funny... stole, uh, i mean BORROWED the wheels off
mom's car and the transmission, too... then they were driving it and
there was a line of cars behind them, blinded by the thick smoke pouring
from the back of the bus. i think they were only going about 10mph,
too... and i get the impression neither of them has ever driven before...
they seemed pretty excited.

OH~! at one point, they were looking in the manual for advice on how to
fix the transmission... here is a quote... 

&quot;Before we go and yank the transmission, maybe we should look at the
owner's manual for some tips&quot;
&quot;trans, trans, trans... transmission tips!... '1) Like, don't mess with
the transmission, man. It's bad karma'... Deep&quot;
&quot;It's a wonder that anything got accomplished in the sixties!&quot;

wavin to all and lovin my grandma!!!
