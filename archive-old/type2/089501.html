Subject: Waste dumping:

And *please* do not dump it.  I live in the country with a water=20
well....if i dump it, i drink it.  yeccch!


    I hope no one miss-understood me, I was not advocating that anyone =
improperly dump any type waste product!!!!!!  Unless its a old Fo*d   =
:-)

    In fact as a &quot;Small Waste generator&quot; in the great State of =
Louisiana, I pay my $75.00 State Paperwork fee. I also have a 300 gal =
waste oil tank behind the shop, that I pay $ .50 a gal to have emptied.=20
    BTW under the title of little know facts: I attended an EPA =
sponsored meeting sometime back. In that meeting we were told that the =
&quot;Selling agent&quot; had to accept a same amount of waste back as sold. In =
other words, if your local Foodmart sells you three quarts of &quot;whiz =
bang&quot; 5 / 30 WT re-refined oil, he must take back three quarts of waste. =
Just a thought!
