Subject: Progressively-Worse Missing/Hesitation

Hello -
On recent drives in my 79 bus I'd been noticing that about once every 100
miles or so (mostly on the freeway), I'd feel the the engine miss ever so
slightly - just a slight burp or hiccup now and again.  Happened again on
the way to this year's Xmas destination about 150 miles away.  But on the
way back home last night, in a howling Columbia Gorge wind, the hiccup
turned into a serious belch.  Instead of a single miss every so often I
began to get successive episodes of hesitation at 55-60 MPH, whereas the
whole bus would shake momentarily.  Then, it would run fine until the next
one -- and as I drove on the episodes began getting progressively worse and
closer together, to the point where I was concerned about making it home.
Sometimes I would go 5 miles without a hitch, and then I'd spend the next 5
riding out different series of misses occurring every 15-20 seconds or so.
I did make it and once I did and was driving through town to my
neighborhood, I noticed that the hesitating  didn't go away at slower
speeds, as it continued to miss going up the hills to my house.  Strangely,
the bus seemed to be idling normally once I finally came to a stop at home.
Now, about a year ago I wrote in about a serious lurching/bucking/hesitation
problem that turned out to be the result of particles in my gas tank
clogging up my fuel flow.  I had the clog blown out (albeit without removing
the crud from the tank) and was told that I would probably not have further
clog problems as long as I kept my fuel tank at least half full -- my tank
was well above the 1/2 mark during my entire trip last night, and I've never
had the problem come back as I always keep it above that level.  Does this
indeed sound like a return of a fuel tank clog problem (which I'd rather not
have to deal with) or can you think of something else -- besides a floating
particle that has finally made it back down to the fuel exit point -- that
might cause such a sudden degradation in the smooth running of my engine?
(BTW, my engine is fuel injected.)  Thanks for any ideas you may have.
