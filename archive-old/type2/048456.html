Subject: [T2] oil light

Hi all,

     I have a strange problem on my 82 westy.  The oil light functions just
the way it is supposed to except it is very dim.  It comes on with the
ignition key &amp; goes right out after I start but it is almost too dim to see
in the bright sunlight.  I looked at the back of the instrument cluster but
did not see anything obvious wrong.  Any ideas?  Thnaks.
