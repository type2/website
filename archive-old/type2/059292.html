&gt;I have the opprotunity to buy, very cheaply, a 1974 bus that was
&gt;converted to a poptop camper by Safare in Hayward, Ca. I searched the
&gt;archives but can't find anything on a poptop Safare camper. The back
2/3
&gt;of the top pops straight up and has four tent sides with windows on
&gt;three sides. There's a full size bed up there and one folds down in the

&gt;back. This camper has an electric refrig and a propane stove behind the

&gt;front passenger seat and a sink and closets behind the driver. There's
a
&gt;dinette where the back seat normally is with the seats on each side
&gt;facing in. All of the camper part of the interior is in pretty good
&gt;shape, the bus itself has been sitting for almost nine ! years and I
&gt;fear the worst for the entire driveline. The body is fair with some
rust
&gt;on the front by the windshield and a couple minor dings in the side. Is

&gt;this beast worth saving? I have never owned a pancake engine before and

&gt;am kind of leery of tackling this one.I'd love to hear any suggestions

Sure sound like a Riviera...  Take a look at
