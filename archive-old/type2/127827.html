&gt; actually I think VW had a correction and stated not to use the serrated
&gt; lock washers at all. I have discarded mine years ago and have had no
&gt; problems just using the funny two holed washers that connect two bolts
&gt; together....

Do you have a service bulletin number for this?  While Volkswagen deleted
the dished washer between the CV hub and the half-shaft, I have never seen
a service bulletin deleting the serrated washers.  In addition, Volkswagen
still sells these washers today.

OOK!
