&gt; Wow, great info Jamie.

&gt; Question: Anyone have an ideas on how **we** can &quot;rate&quot; gasolines from
&gt; various manufacturers?  Maybe someone who has a cylinder temp gauge and
&gt; a regular commute could report some values for us running different
&gt; grades of fuel??

There is generally no difference between the same grade of fuel from
different suppliers.  Fuel is produced to specification and no
refiner has any incentive to produce fuel that exceeds the specifications
markedly.  Fuel is so uniform that refiners routinely swap fuel with each
other, so that tank of upscale fuel you bought at the &quot;orange&quot; station
could well have been refined at the &quot;blue and silver&quot; refinery.

The &quot;whiz-bang&quot; additives you see touted are usually fancy names for
relatively common substances added in only trace quantities.  Since all
stations sell the same product, they have to have something to tout in
their advertising.

What does vary is contamination.  A long time back I did fuel research at
the University of Arizona (that sounds really important, but it was just a
undergraduate engineering course).  The most contaminated fuel came from
poorly-kept stations and from low-volume stations.  You will get the
cleanest gas at visibly clean stations that do a good volume of business.
Contamination is important, as some contaminants (diesel fuel, for
example) can wreak havoc with combustion temperatures.  One station we
checked actaully was selling gasoline that was 5% diesel fuel!  Combustion
temperatures were markedly higher with diesel contamination.
