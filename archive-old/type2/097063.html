Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Westy 2.0L engine weak fire

&gt; I wouldn't sweat the old Bentley, apparently my brain is even older. I
&gt; took a peek in the bentley before driving home tonight, while waiting
&gt; on the bus to warm up. I could find nothing about what the resistance
&gt; should be at running temp. I am almost sure I have heard this
&gt; somewhere but can't verify it. If I can remember, I'll try &amp; see what
&gt; my sensor reads when at temp. Hopefully someone can step up &amp; either
&gt; confirm or deny my memory :)

I could not find it in the Bentley either but.......I did in my AFC FI trouble
shooting guide.

Less than 300 ohms when oil temp is above 80C [176 F]
