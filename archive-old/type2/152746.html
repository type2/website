Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor C(r)ap

This is the first I've heard of this problem.  I have one of these on a
friend's 68 Bug 1600 SP.  Fit right on, set the timing and it's been purring
ever since (about 7 months now) :-)

Now the BRUCK Germany unit...well I could tell some stories I've heard
lately, but most isn't fit for print. ;-)

&gt; So I got one of those new SVDA Mexican distributors from CIP, and got it
&gt; all installed in my bus.  No workie.  After about three hours of diddling
&gt; around with this and that, it turns out that the center of the
&gt; rotor didn't touch the center of the cap.  The cap and rotor came
&gt; installed on the distributor (both are brown).
&gt; Has anyone else had issues with cap and rotor parts not really fitting
&gt; correctly?  I got it to work by leaving off the dust-cover and puttingthe
&gt; rotor on the shaft without pushing it down all the way.  The good news is
&gt; that it works way better than the crusty DVDA I had before, but it sure was
&gt; a waste of time getting it to actually fire off.
&gt; Thanks to everyone who helped me figure out that a new distributor was
&gt; probably going to fix by problems.
&gt; Enjoy,
