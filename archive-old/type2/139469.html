Subject: Re: Oil light intermittantly on

&gt;&gt;OK, after 14 hr trip I changed the oil and filter in daughter's 75 bus
&gt;&gt;and now it intermittantly has the oil light come on and stays on (and
&gt;&gt;goes off again)- oil is present, no change in sound of engine, and I
&gt;&gt;assume it's the sender sticking- can anyone come up with any other
&gt;&gt;reason it might do this? (immaterial if warmed up or not).  Oil temp
&gt;&gt;gauge shows no increase in temp.

&gt;Another thing that can change after long, high speed runs and/or oil
&gt;changes that can cause the pressure light is a sticking oil pressure
&gt;regulator piston. If a piece of crud gets in there and it sticks down, the
&gt;oil will be bled back to the crank case. This is a very dangerous situation
&gt;as it will starve the main bearings.  It will show mostly from a light that
&gt;is on at low RPM but flickers or goes away if you juice the gas.

I can second this because I blew up my homebuilt 1835 type1 engine this
way--an expensive mistake, it threw a rod through the case.  You may warn
her to kill the juice immediately upon hearing the rod knock, it would be a
little cheaper that way.

a good reason on engine disassembly to use the proper tool (or a dowel or
something soft) to remove the oil pressure relief pistons rather than
jamming a screwdriver into them, this was my downfall I think it got
deformed and that's why it got stuck.
