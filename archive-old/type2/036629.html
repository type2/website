Subject: Leaking roof

If you investigate the 'Koolseal' website in the US, you will find they
produce a white mastic roof sealer.  It is not available in the UK but this
may be helpful in solving your leak.  As you have a pop top it may well be
that the rivets on the roof panel have allowed water ingress.  It is a
common fault, with all sorts of repair techniques over the years.  Bitumen
impregnated hessian was one I recall.  Things have moved on I am sure.  The
Koolseal product range seemd to offer some solutions.
Contact 'Just Kampers' for a catalogue.  They have a range of replacement
vents available which should be of assistance.
There are other companies advertising in various UK magazines that can
provide apres or replacement pop tops as desired.
        Regards, BobW
