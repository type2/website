Wade,
  If you have  a VOM (volt/ohm meter) put it on the current
setting and in line with your ground strap. If you can
actually measure current flow with the key off then just
start removing fuses one by one untill you see the current
drop to zero. If you dont have a meter. Then pull the
ground strap and slowly let it touch the battery terminal.
Do you see a spark? (If you have a newer radio installed
they draw current to keep the memory for station settings
etc etc) so I would disconnect the new radio first. Your
battery should be able to handle that kind of current draw.
Anyway do the same thing with the fuses untill the
(hopefully) little spark goes away. If it is a low current
then of course the spark will be small so make sure it is
dark in there&lt;smile&gt;. Once you know which ckt. has the
problem it is a little easier to nail it down to exactly
where the problem is.
  As to the water leak..........????



Now if I can
just find that electrical power drain....  and the water 
leak..... :)
There's always something to fix ;)  .

Thanks again,
Wade
