&gt;This is a parlour trick but I have often thought of trying it &gt;out on the
connectors that  Steve is talking about. Get &gt;yourself a dingy old penny and
a bottle of Tobasco &gt;Sauce(yum, I love that stuff.) Put a drop or two on the
&gt;penny. Wipe it away and watch the shine.

This is fine, until having used 10 bottles without gloves you go to toilet!

Most of the anti-corrosion type products, as used on battery terminal are
just 'Vasaline' or Petroleum jelly with a dye put in for colo(u)r! Also the
base for 'Napalm' etc... This a problem if your connection does 'arc' as
these compounds are flammable. If you look on many PCB's you will see that
they have been coated in a varnish, so if you can clean terminals &amp; then
spray an acrylic varnish on them this should work as well as the jelly based
products
