Subject: Re: [T2] Head problems again/911 engine?

Hi Tim,

I feel your pain. Last summer I burned two valves within 700 miles. 
Both repairs required a major teardown. The seats were fine, but the 
valves had HUGE pieces missing out of them. My bus spent a lot of time 
on jackstands and I got very little done on my other projects.

Personally, I suspect the problem lies with the fuel rather than with 
the cylinder heads. New heads are as likely to fail as originals that 
have run fine for years. The ingredients and procedures used to 
manufacture gasoline just are not what they used to be. If you ask a 
fuel manufacturer what impact that has on combustion temps, you will 
get a very carefully phrased &quot;I don't know&quot;. If you ask a petrochemical 
engineer off the record you will get a lot more info. Modern fuels are 
no longer manufactured with air-cooled engines in mind. I now run with 
a CHT gauge and monitor it carefully, but I know for certain that there 
was not excessive heat when the valve failures occurred. They just came 
apart, and they took my horsepower with them.

What to do about it? Lower compression might help. Experimenting with 
fuel grades and/or suppliers might also help. Changing driving style 
WILL help.  Otherwise I would suggest that a watercooled conversion 
would offer more long-term reliability than what you will get from a 
big-bore aircooled engine.

Happy trails,
