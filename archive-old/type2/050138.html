Subject: [T2] Sketchy call

Hi all.  I haven't talked to the list in a while, hope everyone is well.  
I'm hoping y'll might have some advice for me.  I have a 74 bus with a
rebuilt 2.0 L in it. Well, it has about 8,000 miles on it.  It has been
treated well.  It has a good tranny.  I've done all four ball joints, I've
put 4 new tires on it and 2 new shocks.  It has the fold down bed inside and
the interior is in fair to good condition.  Problem is that when the person
who I bought it from did the motor, they attached a dual exhaust kind of
header assembly to it....basically, straight off the block with 2 cherry
bombs!  They removed the heater boxes altogether and trashed them!
Recently, one side of the exhaust just kinda, well, fell off on me!  Well,
this, obviously, is no good.  However, it is going to cost me about 1400
dollars to have my mechanic do the exhaust and heater boxes the way it
should be....The catch is this:  the undercarriage of my bus is fairly
rusty...is it foolish to put more money into it to try and recoup some of my
expenses when I sell it this spring....or should I just sell it now and cut
my losses?  I bought it for 1200.  have put in about $1,000 before this
exhaust expense.. After all is said and done, what I have done to it will
total about 2400 dollars.  Has anyone recently sold a mechanically decent
'74 or '75 bus that had some undercarriage rust?  Do you mind if I ask you
how much you were able to sell for? 
  
I'm not rolling in the dough over here, as I'm sure some of y'all can relate
to.....trying to figure out if its foolish for me to continue with this
bus.......I love 'er, but she's puttin a dent in me.

Thanks for any advice everyone.
Happy New Year

Dustin
