Here's an easy thing to check:

Check to be sure that the screw holding your condensor to the side of 
your distributor is nice and tight. It functions as the ground for the 
condensor. When mine was loose I had hesitations, worse at higher rpms. 
Tightening screw = problem solved!

If you're lucky, maybe your problem is that easy.

Good luck,
