Subject: Rear Transmission Mounts (Yoke/Hanger/etc)

    Well my project is getting wider in scope with every day that goes by. The
good news is that I have received my rear shift rod bushings and clutch
operating rod bushing kit from Bus Boys and am happy with the speedy shipment!

    Unfortunately, I have found a new broken part: The Bonded rubber mounts in
between the rear (f.i.f.) transmission mount (yoke/hanger) and the chasis. I
need some help tracking down the part number as well as any help with
availability/sources. I seem to remember seing pics of some new ones on
Richard Atwell's sight somewhere but dont seem to be able to track the photo
or any part numbers down now. Anyway, any help with part numbers or sources
for these would be appreciated.

Thanks-Jeff
