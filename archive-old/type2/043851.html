Subject: [T2] RE:Tires

Regarding the question on tires. 
My bus came with Michelins originally installed.
I know because I just replaced them last fall.
My tire dealer looked at the number on the tires,
and was able to come up with a new equivalent 
to the original catalog number.
Continental also has a tire that they  list as being
designed specifically for the Volks Bus, so I wouldn't be
 surpassed if they were a second source OEM.
