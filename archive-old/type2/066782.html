Subject: RE: I had to reboot my '66!!! [f]

&gt;Downside is I might have to reboot the van every once in a while.

I always dislike cycling power to reboot, maybe you should install a reset
switch and a 15 or 20 second timer, along with a solid state relay to reboot
just the clock (after all, most splitties only need a complete reboot after the
swing axles start leaking).

Of course why stop there, you could put a Peltier Effect solid state cooler on
the inside of the roof to cool the fresh air as it comes in, then your clock
will never overheat. :)

I know it's not Friday, but I work 4X10's, so it is for me!

Have a great weekend!
