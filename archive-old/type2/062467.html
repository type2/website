Subject: Re: clattering '72 noise--rod bearing or wrist pin?

&gt;&gt;my nagging feeling is that the noise sounds too superficial and is too
&gt;&gt;clearly connected to combustion to be the rod bearing--but would the
&gt;&gt;wrist pin still fit the bill?  i dont know about wrist pins going bad.from Ken:
&gt;Maybe a cap bolt came loose? Or maybe you accidentally left a clip off a
&gt;wrist pin, and the pin has worked its way out to where it's banging on the
&gt;edge of the bore?

I once had a mid '70 bus.  Took it in for a rebuild.  90 days after, there was NO 
compression in one cylinder.  Took it back.  Reason:  a wrist-pin had wanderred 
over and worn a hole in the cylinder wall.  Of course, not the fault of the shop.  
Not under warranty.  More bucks.  Unhappy camper.

I hope your problem works out better.
