Subject: Re: [T2] blower keeps blowing inline fuse

hello again,

taking some advice from the list i pulled the blower and sprayed silicone
lubricant and sprayable graphite(lock lubricant) in to the hole in the fan
housing(sp?).  seems to have worked since i took goethe on a five hour
drive, 2.5 one way then back again, and the bus was nice and toasty.  the
kids didn't even need their blankets.  still have to wait for several
minutes after i start her before i go any where or she bucks and sounds like
she backfires when i push the pedal too hard.  once she warms up she runs
great except for the poor gas mileage.  15 city 18 highway.  auto, FI.  use
to get much better like 18 city almost 21 highway.  perhaps my math just got
better.  oh well,  she drives wonderfully and handles well, new tie
rods.  love to get her out on the road.  always makes me feel good.



jeremiah and goethe the two tone bullet
