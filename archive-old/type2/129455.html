Subject: Re: [T2] Summer VW Trip Pics

Hello Dan-
We take a cross sountry trek annually across the Northern states and 
Canada and were wondering how you enjoyed the route up the 
Yellowhead-Edmonton-Jasper? We've usually gone a more southerly route, 
just over or below the border of Canada, and found ourselves getting 
very bored in Sasketchewan. We're looking for alternatives for next year

Also how long was the ferry to Manitoulin Island?

I'll take a look at your pics.
