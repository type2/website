What I suggested to Bob (and others who were involved in the
conversation at the time) is a 'cord grip'.  This is the electrical
fitting that is used to connect  'SO' cord (that heavy black rubber
insulated electrical cord) to electrical boxes.  It actually will be a
more secure bulkhead fitting that lamp parts in that it uses a
neoprene compression piece to secure the line from movement. 
Available at your local electrical wholesaler for about $2.00.
