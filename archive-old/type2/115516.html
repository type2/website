Subject: westy interiors

I have a 79 westy, but I want to put in a different intertior.
I would like to have the back seat be full length (like in my friends 74)
I would also like a fridge (not an icebox) that opens up with a regular side 
mounted door, and not with
a lid like the 79.
I still want the stove and a sink.
I like the swivel front passenger seat and the overhead cabinet, but would 
be willing to sacrifice these things if need be. I would like a table in the 
back also.
I saw pictures of I think it was a 68 or 69. it looked similar to what is 
seen in the vanagons.
Does anyone have measurements for that or for the vanagon stove/sink/fridge.
Does anyone have measurements for any of the cabinets from any year?
I don't mind mixin and matching to get what I want.
Anybody have a current layout they are really happy with.
suggestions fopr the best layout to get stove/sink/frige, full backseat, and 
still have plenty of free space and cabinets.
Any one make there own cabinets for the snk and stuff?
Any thing I should know about switching this stuff around.
Any one interested parts of a 79 westy interior?
Thanks,
Kyle
