The cover is there in that photo, but there is a slight optical illusion
that makes it look like is it sticking IN, when it is sticking OUT.

Also look here in the link below - the sump plate sender is made from two
parts, the plate itself and the cover:

Thanks for finding a pic of the cover. I have been searching all over PelicanParts_dot_com
to no avail.

The 1st pic on the left in the 1st row clearly shows the cover, removed. I have only found one cover on about
a dozen real sump plates.
