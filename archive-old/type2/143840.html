Subject: Re: [T2] sockets: regular versus impact

&gt; The basic difference is that the finish on an impact socket won't chip
like chrome will on a regular socket. Not a factor for a ratchet but it
becomes one when you drive it with an air powered impact gun.

It may also be that the impact socket has a thicker wall, making it harder
to use in tight spaces.

I have a set of S-K 6-point sockets with a very finely-toothed ratchet.
Never broke a socket, and the fine tooth ratchet allows me to turn nuts in
very tight spaces without repositioning the socket.
