Subject: Re: replacing roof panel in 70 Westy 

&gt; I guess the donor bus is too far gone to use right? So funds permitting Id
&gt; transplant the proper roof.

Some time ago, soon after acquiring the two buses, I made the decision on
which bus to revive, based on the solidity (much less rot) of the phony
Westy.  The donor bus is now pretty much designated for parts.  Funds
permit, I want the job done right.  I just don't want to cause more problems
than I cure.  It's uncharted territory for me.
