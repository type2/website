&gt; I own a 71 westy which I took out my gas heater of. The heater was located

&gt; need a single connector to link the 2 remaining lines together. Has anyone 
&gt; done this before know what size connector to use?
&gt; thanks

I believe (&amp; i'm gussing here) that what you did was remove your
heater &amp; you are asking how to attach the lines that remain together?
If this is the case I would recommend just replacing the entire length
of gas line. The less connections there are the lower (hopefully) the
chance of failure.
