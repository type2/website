Hi, 

&gt; Can you say, &quot;Periodic Maintenance Inspection.&quot; ...
&gt; ...If you had kept notes on when those parts were last 
&gt; replaced/inspected...


 Err, this is a bit unfair, if I may say so. He'd only just bought
the bus and was driving it home from the seller!!!


&gt; If you have to carry spare parts for daily driving, you are 
&gt; anticipaing failure. If you do not compromise basic maintenance
&gt; procedures, you are insuring success and don't need to carry
&gt; any spare parts.

 Breakdown cover (AA, RAC, AAA etc.) insures against failure.
 Periodic maintenance ensures reliability.

&gt; The Deutscshes Methode will set you free, reduce your cost per
&gt; mile, protect you from perils, and improve your life.

 Yep, this is good stuff, but if you don't mind me saying so you
could stand to lighten your tone a touch :-).

Cheers,
	W.
