Subject: [T2] compression ratio vs compression?


&gt; Here's the question. Since compression measurements are much easier to
&gt; obtain, is there any way to use these as indicators of a compression
&gt; ratio that is too high? i.e. if a given compression ratio (7:1 or
&gt; whatever) can be considered optimal, is there a certain compression (in
&gt; psi) that can also be considered optimal (and larger values might be
&gt; considered too high)? If so, what would this number be?

There certainly *is* a relationship between compression ratios and measured
compression.  However, I'd guess the mathematical expression relating the
two involves air temperature, air density, cylinder temperatures, etc.
Somebody might be able to post some rough &quot;rule of thumb&quot; sort of
expression, or you might even Google it and see what you come up with.

However, I'd say if you did a compression test and came up with numbers well
above the high number indicated in Bentley for your vehicle would indicate
you've got a compression ratio problem, though the problem might not be
strictly &quot;mechanical&quot; (e.g., too-small deck height) as a severe carbon
build-up could also affect these numbers.
