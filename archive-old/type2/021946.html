Ciao from Aviano AB Italy!!  Quick question, as you all know from the news
we are very active currently in this part of the world.  Outside our front
gate is a group protesting the war and they have created a colorful flag
with the word &quot;PACE&quot; on it which is Italian for peace.  This conflict has
been compared to Vietnam and since I drive a VW bus.....I thought one of
those flags might just be a nice touch.  I have been told that it is
possible to get some and was wondering if anyone else was interested. I know
it's not the traditional Peace sign....but it is unique to this conflict.
Will forward cost as it becomes available.  Oh the things in this conflict
my VW has seen.....Ciao for now!!
