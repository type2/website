Subject: Re: Trip Report: Border partings :-(

i  sympathaze with your border problems.    ive crossed the canadian border a
dozen times or more since living in Wa state, but usually it's the us customs
that is the hassle.   one time we were searched by the us leaving the us, and
then the canadians entering canada!  usually the canadians are really nice,
and we have to deal with the US treating us like criminals coming back in.
  for some reason they dont like longhaired folks in old vw buses.      i
just assume i will be searched at the border.  i know it's not personal. 
 to make the searching time easier i suggest:

1)   have all your money &amp; paperwork handy with you *before* reaching the
border.

2)   don't carry any illegal substances.  if it is something you might have
done, make sure there is NO trace in the ashtray, under the seats, floor mat,
etc.    even if it was hidden by the DPO, it will be your *ss on the line.  i
have found stuff in junkyard buses i would not want in my bus at the border.
   

3)  make the van REALLY messy

4)  label the container of oregano &quot;pot&quot;   (just kidding)

5)  have as many greasy vw parts as possible on top of other stuff.  the
border workers wear clean white shirts, and don't want to get them dirty.
  :)

6)  spiky bits of wire don't hurt, either, for the insulator collector types,
who may have been taking insulators off of crossarms..

7)  remember, this is business as usual, but serious business.   dont joke
around.  dont have 'bomb' written on your vehicle.  be polite, say sir, or
ma'am.  know that if you say you'll be there for a month they will be more
harsh, expect more money, etc. than if you say you are visiting for the
weekend, or week.    you want to visit their wonderful country.   &quot;i am here
to hike your wilderness&quot;.  smile.  you are wholesome folk.   whatever
happens, don't cuss them out or be a smartass.   they can, and will if they
feel like it, tear your beloved vw to bits and leave you a basket case.  

8) be clean and tidy when you get to the border.   wash your hair and shake
the pine needles out of it.   

9)  fill the tank before entering canada.   and the spare can.  (you are
allowed a 5 gallon can)
  
i hope the trip goes well :/
