I have a 24&quot; piece of 1X6 that is employed solely for this purpose. The
soft wood is alot more forgiving to the sump fins and filter plate than the
steel floor jack in case your balancing act goes to pot while lowering your
motor. You'll still that friend with the beer to help you heft that 200lb
motor onto your work bench. (unless you're Lou Ferigno) Don't do this
alone! Chiropractors love people who do this alone.
