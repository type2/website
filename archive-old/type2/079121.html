&gt;I think it's probably a good thing to get my torque wrench recalibrated

&gt;adjustment.
&gt;
&gt;Where do I go to get this done?  Does Sears do this or are there special
&gt;shops that'll do it?
==========================&gt;
It's a Craftsman.
Tell 'em it does not meet spec any more, and you want a new one.
Lifetime warranty on Craftsman tools.
