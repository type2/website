Subject: Deluxe Micro and KC Show

Volks,
        It's been a great weekend here in the midwestern U.S. in 
Indianola, Iowa. This past week I finally took possession of a 1965 21 
window Deluxe microbus - Seablue with blue-white combo. I had purchased 
it a couple of months ago but finally arranged towing from its resting 
place in a barn outside of Des Moines, Iowa. It definitely will need 
alot of work- which I will attempt to do with your help. Aside from the 
usual body work - both rockers, both rear corners, a couple nose dents, 
it has no engine, starter or gas tank. However for a vehicle that was 
still on the road in 1988 in Iowa it is in basically solid shape. All 
the glass but the passenger sliding window is intact and there. Even the 
sunroof works fine (but looks a little faded/rough). This will be a fun 
and time-consuming project I'm sure - but for $490 what do you expect...
        I also went down to the Kansas City show (Bug-Blitz) in Lenexa, 
Kansas) on Saturday and had a great time. I scored some great deals at 
the swap meet - for example:
        Complete Jailbar set for my 65 Deluxe: $30.00
        NOS Vent Window Latch for &quot; &quot;        :   8.00
        Pop-out Window Latch for  &quot; &quot;        :   2.00
        Rear turn Signal Assembly for &quot; &quot;    :   5.00
        Owners Manual for 92 Jetta           :   7.00
        Right side Vanagon Front Turn Lens   :   5.00

        There were some fine vehicles in the show but the only 21 Window 
 Deluxe had been converted to a camper ? Also a 1955 Oval with only 
28,000 original miles. Met some fine folks including Jon Christensen. I 
left the show early then to get back to Indianola, Iowa and see a 1974 
bus that was for sale with fellow Type2 listmember Mike Wright.. All in 
all a good week...
