Subject: Strange engine

&gt;I found a strange engine at the flee market. Its similiar in design to the
&gt;VW engine,came out of Army surplus(painted green) and has Colt Ind. on the
&gt;tag thats bolted to it. It has a keyd shaft coming out of the flywheel were
&gt;the glandnut would be. A friend asked if it could be used on a welder setup.
&gt;They ask $1000 for it which seemed high to me.

Stephen Weiford,
You may have found an engine from a Vietnam-era mule.  Mules were flatbed
transport vehicles used by Americans during the Vietnam war.  They had big
wheels, real short turning radii, no sides and magnesium bodies.  They were
designed as a direct result of the French experience at Dien Bien Phu where
the Vietnamese communists shelled the French positions and all the French
vehicles had leaky cooling systems so they couldn't get ammo from landing
zones or drop zones to the gun positions during the rainy (both artillery
and water) season.  Mule engines were very like VWs but were started with a
rip cord.  I've always wanted to find a mule for sale, but have never seen
either the platforms or the engines in the U.S.
