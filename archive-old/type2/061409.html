Subject: Baja Bus site

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
Just a quick note to let you guys know that my Baja Bus site has just been
updated.  There are now some cool pics of a Kombi jumping sand dunes (all
four wheels off the ground) and a twin cab pulling out a bogged 4WD (Love
that one)

Anyway check them out at http://www.baja_dot_com/kombi go the the &quot;What's New&quot;
page and follow the link or go to the third &quot;Picture&quot; page.

Cheers
Steve
