Subject: side marker lights and lenses

hey folks, does anyone know what is the correct color of the trim for my 
side markers on my 79 camper?  It's the plain camper with ice box and 
sink.  I thought the trim should be black as opposed to silver.  My rear 
hatch and engine lid buttons are black.  The only 2 remaining side markers 
on the camper are the rear ones and they both have silver trim.  I'm taking 
it to the body shop tomorrow and want to order the correct lenses (black or 
silver)  TIA, Greg
