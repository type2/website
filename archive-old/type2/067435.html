Subject: Re: Westfalia Tent Repair Parts and [f]

&gt;Happy Friday
&gt;
&gt;I just purchased a westy tent from a fellow list member (hi, Darren) and
&gt;need sources/advice for a few missing bits. This is a later style tent with
&gt;floor which is a grey rubberized fabric. Along the edges of the floor,
&gt;there are &quot;loops&quot; for staking it down. The &quot;loops&quot; are actually a moulded
&gt;rubber piece which is glued onto the tent floor. I'm missing a handful of
&gt;these, and either 1) need to find a source for replacements, (preferrable)
&gt;or, 2) substitute something else in their place. Does anyone know of a
&gt;source for Westfalia tent parts or have a good alternative? My wife
&gt;commented that they looked like something that might also be seen on a
&gt;rubber raft for securing ropes to. Ring any bells? As always, thanks.
&gt;
&gt;And... since it is Friday I'm enclosing the below story. Hope it doesn't
&gt;offend anyone. I got it earlier this week and made me laugh out loud in the
&gt;middle of a fairly crappy day.

  Well John, in honor of Uncle Ted, I'll make a couple of suggestions.

 First, I kind of like steel rings in those spots.

 I would go to the &quot;Grange Co-op&quot; where I live, where they have the 
&quot;horsey stuff&quot;.  
  They usually have stainless rings in 2-3&quot; diameter for harnesses 
 etc.

  Then I'd get some canvas about 18&quot; long and triple fold and sew,
 this is to go thru the rings.

 Sew the ring into the middle and then sew across the bottom of tent
 and up the side equally.

 Seal the whole thing good with &quot;Snow-seal&quot; or at least &quot;rubber cement.

 You can get a hand awl at any leather hobby shop, might even get your rings
there. &quot;Tandys&quot; if you recall the name.

 You could do this with a good piece of rope but it will go the way 
of the &quot;rubber dingus&quot; in time.

 On the short term basis: being extremely &quot;crude&quot; and only using a 
&quot;fly-leaf&quot; canvas for the whole tent myself, I carry some &quot;Nerf&quot; golf
balls in my pack.

 Where I want a &quot;tie-off&quot;, I stick the ball (or even a sock) inside
and wrap a loop of line around it on the outside and have an instant
&quot;tie point&quot;.
