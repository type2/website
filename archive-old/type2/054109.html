Subject: Re: front beam interchangibility

As Vince said, any beam with the bracket for the brake assist can will do.
Both the '73 and the '79 will fit your bus.  If you are in the US, both
will have that bracket as all US-spec buses had vacuum-assist brakes.
Note however that outside the US options varied considerably!  If you are
not in the US, Vince is right, you need to check and be sure that the
bracket is there if you want power brakes :-)

One other trivia point is that there was a minor change in either the
bracket placement or the vacuum-assist can diameter between '71 and '79.
When I sent my '79 vaccum-assist can to David Schwarze for use on his '73,
the can rubbed on something because it was a bit larger than his original
one.  I think it worked out OK,tho. (David???)  If are replacing the beam
wiht one from a different year, I would advise removing the beam from the
donor along with the vacuum assist can to be sure that this is not a
problem :-)
