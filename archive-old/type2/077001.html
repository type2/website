Subject: FOR SALE:  2 sets of Used AMC Vanagon Heads

To the list;

I have two (2) sets of good, used, rebuildable AMC heads for the 80-83 =
2.0L air-cooled Vanagon engine.  These heads came off &quot;CV&quot; engines.  =
They have the rectangular exhaust ports.

The heads need to be cleaned up and rebuilt.  They appear to be =
crack-free.  As with most stock Type 4 heads, each head has at least one =
dropped valve seat.  RIMCO quoted me $180 to rebuild each set.  RIMCO =
stated their head rebuild would include &quot;drop proof&quot; valve seats, new =
valves and guides, plus the standard 3-angle valve job.

$50 for each pair (plus shipping costs).  Each set weighs approx. 40 lbs =
and would be shipped from zip 93010.

Please respond off-list.
