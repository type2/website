Subject: Re: Grammer 

&gt;OK
&gt;After reading my more recent message with all the replies,(thanks to
&gt;all) I saw how HORRIBLE my spelling and grammer were. I will try
&gt;to remember to proofread my messages from now on.......

  I don't think you need worry about your grammar or spelling in this
 group. Most of us have degrees and can't spell either. 
  I always assume the more illegible the higher the degree.
