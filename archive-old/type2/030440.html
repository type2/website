Volks,

Well, I am about crapped out.  Snake eyes all the way :-(  I too the bus
to Foreign Affaires in Albuqueque, NM.  they fixed the immediate problem,
which was ignition related, but the bus is still getting too hot for my
tastes, plus on the way out of town, I got a new growl at slack throttle
(between acceleration and deceleration) which sounded very CV'ish to me,
but could be anything.  I came back and am staying the night in
Albuqueque.  I have an AM appointment at Foreign Affaires to look into the
problem and an oil change (2200 miles since DC, and about time.  I am
headed for the chat room after posting this (irc.type2_dot_com), until they
kick me off the library computer here.
