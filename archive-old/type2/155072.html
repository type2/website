Subject: Workarounds

I once experienced a sudden loss of forward motion
on the freeway. I coasted to to the side and
discovered that the recently replaced CV joint had
come loose. Curse the idiot mechanic! Oh wait, that
would have been me ;-).  Fortunately, all or most of
the bolts were still there. Among the meager stash
of tools I had on bard was a pair of the smallest
vice grips. After finger tightening the CV bolts, I
clamped the vice grips on the bolt heads and was
able to tighten them well enough to get me home.
 
Love them vice grips!

CV's kept falling off the wheel...until I figured
out
to NOT use anti-seize and to install the OEM
lockwashers (dirt cheap from the VW dealer). And
give
'em a little extra torque...  ;0)
  
So I'm stranded at jack-in-the-box, with just one 
mangled bolt (the others had fallen off). Didn't
have
the tool, so I couldn't borrow from the other side. 
Ended up retracing my route on foot for about 3/4
mile, plucking CV bolts out of the street while
dodging traffic.  3 or 4 bolts finger-tight got me
home.
