Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Valves

I've been looking for said &quot;automatic&quot; valve that would open when the 
ignition was turned on but have so far been unable to find it.

I'm still looking.

Would be a great safety item in case of fire - would keep fuel from beeing 
added to the fire and would require no effort to close - I'm certainly not 
going to lean under my bus to turn a valve!!!

Maybe a brass valve with a choke cable added to the lever...

&gt;&lt;&lt; A small ball valve with fuel-proof seals will do fine. &gt;&gt;

&gt;Someone mentioned once before that marine equipment/parts suppliers are a
&gt;good source for these kinds of things.
