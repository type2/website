Subject: Re: Dual battery wiring

I have the stock aux battery setup in my '79 Deluxe
Campmobile.  The aux system hasn't been used in
several years.  I'm about to go through it all, buy a
new gel cell battery and test it all out.  I plan to
keep the stock charging and isolating configuration
with a few small changes inquired about below.

I've taken the stock fridge out.  [off topic - using a
Dometic RC3000, mostly on propane - survived Black
Rock Desert for a week and it just sipped fuel, it
rocks!]  I plan to keep using the fridge control panel
and use the fridge wire to power a car stereo (say
200-250 watts max), and a 12 volt socket for a laptop,
power inverter and other goodies.  Not simultaneously,
of course.

My basic(?) questions are:
1) According to a schematic I downloaded  - looks like
a Bentley's diagram - the fuse coming out of the aux
battery is 16 amps, with an additional 10 or 15 amp
fuse inline before the fridge wire at the control
panel (10 amps max according to the panel lettering,
15 according to the schematic).  I'd like to run a 15
amp fuse at the control panel - if it isn't already. 
Any reason not to?

2) Can I use a *slightly* lower gauge wire running
from the relay to the aux battery - within reasonable
safety limits?  I understand from what I've read that
the Hella wire errs on the thin side - a bit of 
overkill.  I'd like to play the car stereo moderately
loud while driving/charging.  I surmise I can go to a
slightly thicker wire and still be safe.  How much
thicker?  Also, should I then upgrade to a higher
amp-rated relay?

3) Is it necessary to upgrade to a higher output
alternator or will the slightly thicker wire running
to the aux battery accomplish much of the same result?

Thanks,

&gt; &gt; I bought a Hella dual battery relay kit from Ron
&gt; recently but the
&gt; &gt; instructions don't make sense to me.  The only
&gt; wiring that's really
&gt; &gt; clear is the brown to earth.  All other
&gt; connections are left open to
&gt; &gt; interpretation.  I know lots of you have done this
&gt; and I'll probably get
&gt; &gt; several different answers but I'm open to
&gt; suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a reply directly to me yesterday on my aux
&gt; battery wiring question from
&gt; Andrew Stewart for which I am truly grateful.  He
&gt; pointed me at this link which
&gt; was very helpful:
&gt; http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/aux-batt.htm
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest that this write-up be added to the
&gt; Type2 tech pages as it says it
&gt; all.  Because it also shows a good diagram of the
&gt; isolator setup I was able to use
&gt; that to get my original isolator back on line.  So
&gt; now I have a relay kit to keep
&gt; in reserve in case the original ever fails.
&gt; 
&gt; One curious thing is that when I hooked a test light
&gt; up, after it was all
&gt; together, going from body ground to the aux battery
&gt; produced no light with the
&gt; engine off but did with it on.  Which, I guess,
&gt; proves that the battery is truly
&gt; isolated to the fridge and power plugs when the
&gt; engine is off and that they ground
&gt; directly to the aux battery rather than grounding to
&gt; the body.
