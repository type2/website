You might check out the main power supply wire that runs from the
solenoid on the starter to the fuse box. Check it for good connections
on both sides, and that it isn't broken at some point. On my bus ('79
Kombi) it is a fairly thick (4 or 6mm^2, I don't remember) wire, and
is red-with-a-white-stripe on it.

The previous owner of my bus had the wire cut at some point, and
connected them again by soldering it and covered it with a bit of
masking tape. Needless to say that it didn't really last (oxydation!),
so I laid another wire along it and removed the original wire where
possible. Which wasn't too much work, actually.

Regards,
Mrten.
