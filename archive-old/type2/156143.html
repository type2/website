Subject: oil temp sender

Hey, guys.  Good day for me.  Thanks to Karl for pics of the  taco plate with the oil temp sender installed.  Went down to my  local VW guru to see if he had one.  He told me to go pull one off  an engine he had in the back.  I did and it'll work great.  I  asked him about the motor.  He said he thought it came out of one  of the busses in his yard.  I asked him if it worked and he said  for me to see if I could turn the crank.  It turned smoothly by  hand.  He said it was probably good if I'd put heads on it.   Pistons even looked good and I didn't see any cracks in the  block.  He says it's bigger than 1.7 but he's not sure if it's a  1.8 or a 2.0.  So I'm thinking, hmm, nice to have in the garage to  build as I have the time and the money.  He said to give him $50  and get it out of his way!  So I go looking for a taco plate and  end up with an engine.
  
  So I'm soliciting advice on how to build this sucker.  Stock for  longevity or bore it out and soup it up for performance.  And do I  want to try to find all the stuff to put back on fuel injection.   I'll probably run with my 1700, single Weber, 009 set up as long as the  Bopmobile runs as good as it is now.  I'm amazed at how good she's  running.  But I've always wanted to build an engine myself to have  on hand when I need it.   I plan on keeping the bus for a long  time.   Advice?  
  
  Thanks and cheers....KR
