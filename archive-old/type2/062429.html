Subject: Transmission oil change

I had a very easy time changing my trans oil last week end in my  '77 westy.
I got some 80w-90 oil from Walmart that came in long thin quart containers
with small clip off spouts at the end.  Get up in there with the container
(no pumps needed) and squeeze as much out of it as you can (I usually got 
80-90% of the oil out of each one.  Since  the tranny takes 3.5 quarts buy
4 quarts and get them all in as best you can.  Then pour the remainder of each
bottle into one and finish the job.  You should be left with half a quart if 
you don't spill any (I didn't spill any and  mine came out almost exact).
It was very easy and didn't require any ingenious pumps.

Now for a question:  Every one keeps mentioning &quot;Hypoid&quot; oil.  What is this?
I did not see any mention of this on the oil I bought but it said for use in
transmissions, gearboxes, and differentials.  Do I need &quot;Hypoid&quot; (I seem to
recall Hypoid having something to do with high pressure) oil or will plain 
old 80w-90 work?

Thanks,
Brett
