Subject: [T2] Horn page...  wait a second

Volks, 

After some further discussions, I am unsure of a couple of things I said
on the pages I put up last night.  I will be revisiting my steering column
with the ol' VOM when I get home this evening and will report on the
results and revise the pages as necessary.  the procedure obviously works
(I have a working horn :-), but the route that the electricity takes in
the steering column is still a bit of a mystery to me.  I *think* I
understand the current flow now, but want to test the theory.

I should know better than to say that something on a bus works by magic...  
I already know that the whole thing works on magic, but that it is a
rational brand of such :-)
