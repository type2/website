Subject: CV Joint  what is this part called

Hello, 
 
I just installed a rebuilt transaxle into my 69 bus. It is going very smoothly. I have one concern . When i disconnected the CV joints from the old transaxle I noticed that one side (right) has a thin dished kind of a washer that is equal in diameter to the CV joint itself. It seems like this thing holds all of the grease into the CVjoint. The other side is missing this thing. The one that is on there is kind of dented. I'd like to replace them both and repack the CVjoint with grease while it's apart but i dont know what it's called .
 
Many thanks 
Mick
