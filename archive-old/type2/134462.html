Subject: DP vs. SP flaps

Thanks to all for the posts.  They have been great information and
entertainment for me.

I have a 1600 DP in my 71.  With all of the discussion on flaps and
thermostats, I have been interested in setting my engine up with them.  I have
the tstat and rod.  I have also found a source for the flaps.  However, the
source does not know if they are from a SP or DP.  I have been told that they
are different.  Does anyone know how they can be differentiated?

Thanks,
Henry
