&gt;&gt; &gt;  Just thinking about running synthetic in my new motor. Is it worth it?
&gt;&gt;  &gt;What brand and weight should I choose? I have heard Mobil 1 is the best.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I use Mobil One 15w50 year round in Minnesota with good results.  No
&gt;&gt;  jump-starting, even in our winters.

&gt;I used to use Castrol 20w-50 in the summer and 10w-30 in the winter, also
&gt;Minnesota, but tried Castrol Synthetic 5W-50 this winter.  So far it's done
&gt;pretty well.

Yeah, except the Castrol isn't synthetic at all.  It's a cut-rate,
half-assed imitation of a synthetic.  Didn't you read the Car and Driver
column I posted here?
