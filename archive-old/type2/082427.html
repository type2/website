Congratz on your engine, I'll be interested to hear more about it
as you get some miles on it.

&gt; needed to be. I did learn a few useful things: There are 6=20
&gt; bolts (not 4) at the front of the engine that need to be=20
&gt; removed. The four that hold the engine to the trans everyone=20
&gt; knows about. However to properly remove the engine, you must=20
&gt; also remove two bolts on top of the trans that hold the trans=20
&gt; to the frame. The idea is that you are supposed to put a jack=20
&gt; under the trans and lower it a few inches, which will allow=20
&gt; everything to be removed smoothly. I removed my engine=20
&gt; without doing this which is not supposed to be possible.=20
&gt; That's part of why the engine removal was such a bear.=20

Hmm, I'm not sure if I understand.  I've only removed mine (a '79)
once, but I just removed the 4 bolts (and the engine bearer) and it
came right out, and I did read the manual.

If you removed the tranny mounts, how did you secure the tranny when
the engine was out?  Ooh, that just reminded me of a question for the
list that I'll post later ...
