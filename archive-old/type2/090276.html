Considering that VW doesn't make generators (and if they did these days,
they'd be watercooled), your best bet is a Honda.  They make _very_ nice
small generators.  I have a 20-year-old EM-500 that still starts on the
first pull after sitting for months.  You won't find a quieter generator,
and the capacities of the new models is double that of my old one.  Spend
a few more dollars for a Honda and you'll be happy for a long time (as
will your campground neighbors)

BTW, the quality of Honda generators has caused some unscrupulous
manufacturers to use Honda industrial engines in their own generators,
with the &quot;Honda&quot; name prominently shown.  These are not the generators you
want as the Honda-made generators are an integrated unit designed
specifically for making electricity.
