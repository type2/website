Subject: [T2] Parts stores in Tampa

Hi all,

Can any listees recommend a couple of good parts stores in Tampa, Fl.? I
will be travelling there on business in a couple of weeks and need to pick
up a few things. This trip I'm especially interested in interior pieces,
carpets, etc. for the Bus. I am also looking for some misc bug pieces as
well. 

TIA,

John B.
