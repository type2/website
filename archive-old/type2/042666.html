Subject: Oshkosh and Appleton, WI events

Hey all,
We're having a get together in Oshkosh this weekend.  Its at Menominee
Park in Oshkosh which is right on the lake.  Picnic/get together from
noon until 6pm.  There is also an event in Appleton, WI called &quot;License
to Cruise&quot;  It is sponsored by 96.9 The Foxx radio station and everyone
is invited to go out.  From what I hear...it should be a fun event.  A
friend told me its like &quot;American Graffiti&quot; for one night of the
year...  stoplight olympics...etc.  its a general classic car cruise.
We meet at the Northland Mall at 6 and the cruise is at 10pm.  The
northland mall is putting on a &quot;show&quot; or sorts ...no entry fees or
trophies or anything...basically just a classic car BS session..  Should
be a helluva time.  Come on out and play!

Drive em!
