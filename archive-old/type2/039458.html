&gt;Hi,

&gt;I have an odd misfire at highway speeds.

I had an aftermarket voltage regulator that was putting out too much juice.
It caused similar symptoms, but more frequently than you describe. Mine was
an Autozone model and it was cranking out 18volts....yowsa! If yours was
putting out say 14.5, maybe you'd get the misfire less frequently...I'm
guesing here.

Thanks! Joe
