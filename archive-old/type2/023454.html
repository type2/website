Ah, the first signs of summer: the oil temp question.

My 81 with vdo guage and sender mounted in the sump plate routinely runs 230* 
to 250* at 55 to 65mph. I consider 250* my &quot;redline&quot; and only use synthetic 
oil.

============================================
I have a 1980 Vanagon air cooled Westy. I installed a Stewart Warner oil
temp guage and the sending unit screws into the drain plug. I usually
consider that at 230 it is time to slow down and feel comfortable with any
reading below that. Does anyone else run a Stewart Warner or other good
quality guage? I would appreciate hearing from others as to their average
temperature. Is 270 too hot and a danger to the engine? Do I have the
sending unit in a good place to represent the actual oil temp? Tia, Steven
Phelps.
