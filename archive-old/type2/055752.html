&gt;  A couple of months ago i started gathering rubber for the dormobile that is
&gt;in the shop getting paint and body work.I quickly found that finding the
&gt;nonvented side window rubber pt#221-321c wasn't going to be easy.I contacted
&gt;several usually reliable vendors.All of which gave me the same
&gt;answer,Volkswagen stopped making that over a year ago and we don't know where
&gt;to get any.The only place I found it was the bus depot, but couldn't see
&gt;paying 59.00 a piece for the german stuff .WCM had not at the time gotten the
&gt;shipment of Mexican stuff that they said was held up at the Border and
they're
&gt;still gearing up for production of it. I tried calling for several weeks and
&gt;constantly got the same answer...not here yet try again next week.I quickly
&gt;grew tired of all the run around but didn't think I had an alternative.
&gt;   Then in march I went to a show in Atlanta,went up to the new parts vendor
&gt;with the same question expecting the same answer and was very suprised
when he
&gt;said &quot;yeah I got some that will work for 17.00 they're actually rear window
&gt;rubber pt #211-521c but they're a good fit&quot;. I thought this guy's got to be
&gt;kidding, he's selling WCM rubber and If it was interchangeable WCM would have
&gt;surely let me know this one of the times I called.Well, after much assurance
&gt;that it would fit I decided to take the chance. This week I decided to
give it
&gt;a shot and found it does fit very nicely on the glass,no overstretching or
&gt;slack.
***********************************************

Well, no one contacted me.  I've been making these and supplying RMMW (and
WCM on occasion) for quite a few years now.  Actually the side window seal
is about 1 1/2&quot; longer than the rear window seal, but in a pinch the rear
will work - a little tighter, but close.  I still purposely make the two
different seals even though they're close in size purely for personal fit
reasons.

I get $19.95 each for 'em, the rear window is $18.00.

I guess I'll have to start advertising them on my OddBall List so people
know I got 'em.
