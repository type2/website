Transmission rebuilding service offered

With all the talk about having trouble finding anyone to rebuild trannys,
and the horrible service from those that have taken money and not delivered
the proper job, I have decided to offer my services.

I read the Bentley tonight and think I am up to the job. It just takes a few
extra tools and some parts and there you go! I have a partner up here that
used to work on &quot;Bugs&quot; and she said he would help me out on the &quot;hard stuff&quot;
 .
I have a VW dealership in the area, and am sure they would be happy to get
rid of their old parts at a good price. They will be very helpful in finding
any obsolete parts, as they are computerized and can find the other stuff. I
bet they will enjoy going through the old parts books as will be nostalgic,
and kinda fun.

Please keep in mind that I will have some start-up costs so will need the
money in advance. I think $300.00 ought to cover a quality job.

I realize that we have never &quot;actually&quot; done one of these jobs but looks
really easy if you just look at the pictures and do it right the first time!
&quot;Quality is Job One&quot; is our motto!!

Send your used transmission and the $300.00 in a check made out to CASH
(this will help on bookkeeping and save sales tax) to my partner:
