Adam,

Scrape the area vigourously with a heavy wire brush. Pick loose any loose
paint. Wash, rinse and dry the area. Treat the exposed metal with Ospho or
another rust conversion chemical and dry completely. You will find this at
the same place you find the Marine Batteries, at a chandlery or marina, and
at many hardware and auto stores. I believe Ace Hardware typically has it.

No need for primer. Primer is primarily for creating a baby's butt smooth
base for an aesthetically smooth top coat finish, which is only a
consideration if you're into concourse points. Three or five light to
medium coats of brand name enamel, Rustoleum, Krylon, etal, with 5 to 10
minutes between coats will seal the metal (follow the can instructions).
You want this hard dry before reinstalling the battery. Keep the top of the
battery case and the terminals clean of coorsive residue/dust/dirt/acid
vapor buildup which is the pre-mature killer of charging/starting systems
components. Only a bone dry and clean battery case will prevent a cell
cross flow mini amp draw that loads the system unnecessarily.

Keep your eye on Cain, will ya?
