Subject: Re: [T2] Kilocalorie to Btu conversion?

&gt; Any of y'all know the formula to convert kilocalories to Btu's? The new 
&gt; boyfriend swears up and down that the little bitty BN-2 gas heater that he 
&gt; retro'ed into one of his old bay window buses, (out of a bug) worked just 
&gt; dandy to keep everyone warm up in MA, in the winter. I think it was the 
&gt; &quot;antifreeze&quot; in him that did the trick. I just don't see how 2000k/cal ( 
&gt; which I think is around 8-9k Btu, but could be wrong) would turn the trick. I 
&gt; seem to remember that the BN-4 was rated at 6000k/cal, and that's what the 
&gt; put into late bays, right?

I would suspect that the smaller unit would have a significant effect when
added to the stock bus heat and if the van is reasonably tight.  I have
the BA-4 in my bus (from a 411/412) and it does a pretty good job in my
not so very tight bus with the stock heat system removed.    the biggest
difference is that it would have a longer &quot;on&quot; cycle than the larger unit.
