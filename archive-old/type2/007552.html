&gt;Hey folks,
&gt;I picked up a '78 and I really want to get to work on customizing it, but I
&gt;have had trouble getting data on HOW I should go about lowering it..

I think you'll find most of the listees will disapprove of the idea, 
that's been the consensus on this in the past. Check the archives _at_ 
vw.i405_dot_com for some of the flowery responses... There's few enough good 
busses running around as is, seems like an odd idea to make irreprable 
modifications to a decent bus. Thats MHO anyway...


Peace,
