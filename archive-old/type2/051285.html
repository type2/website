&gt; Hi all:

&gt; I removed the CV joint that was full of transmission oil that I wrote
&gt; about last time in order to clean it up and repack it.  I reassembled
&gt; it, properly I think, but I'm having a problem.  The central hub of
&gt; the CV joint (that thing with splines that fits on the axle itself)
&gt; WILL NOT MOVE!  The cage moves back and forth, the balls move back and
&gt; forth, but that central hub won't move at all, even if I put
&gt; considerable pressure on it.

You put it together wrong.  There's a right way and a wrong way and you've
found the wrong way!  You can take it apart, but it's a bit of a puzzle!
