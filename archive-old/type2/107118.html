Subject: Re: [T2] Tire Data Sticker?

&gt; In fact, the tire package
&gt; sold by gowesty for the 15&quot; aluminum rims comes
&gt; shod with standard load michelin x-one tires (max
&gt; pressure 35 and max load 1500).  Not even close
&gt; by your rule of thumb or bentley.  Clearly, not
&gt; everyone is getting the message.

Have you read GoWesty's article on the issue?  It's not all that scientific,
but interesting:  &lt;http://www.gowesty_dot_com/wheelstiresinfo.html&gt;
