Subject: Heater Blower Fan

Ok. Its cold here in MD right now, and my blower motor went out.

First, does anyone have one, or know where I can get a new one?

I went thru the archives which led to Richard Atwells site, and found
his write up on heating system maintenance.  Ill be dealing with
that next in an attempt to pump up the heat output.

In the mean time, Im running a Coleman Powercat propane heater that
does a moderate job at asphyxiating me and a poor job of heating the
cabin.

I hate the cold

Frigidly yours,

Dave.
