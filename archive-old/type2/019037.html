Plurality
   by Noahcount Webster

Upon the List, it's often said
That dictionaries should be read ...
That proper nouns and plurals, too,
Are oft misspelled by one or two ...
That in the pages Webster wrote
Is found the proper spelling note
To guide the errant Busophile
In proper English form and style.

But even Webster is unsure,
And so two forms we must endure
When plurals of our bus we write
Into our email, day and night.
To me, it's simple, without fuss:
Where there is one, you spell it &quot;bus&quot;;
Where two or more? it's easy done ...
The plural form is simply &quot;fun&quot;!! :)

Tales of the Workshop
   by Robert W. Service-Advisor

             Mechanics that Vanish

      Oh, the stories we hear, like the stars in the sky,
         Have all been encountered before,
      But just when you think that you've heard of them all,
         A new one will drive through the door.

Strange tales oft repeat, when you talk of the heat
In the summers down South, I am told.
'Bout the hot steady glare from the sun way up there
That makes you crazy for anything cold.

When the lack of fresh air being moved anywhere
In the shop makes the walls seem to close,
And the sweat streaming down, cross your furrow-like frown,
Runs like water from the end of a hose.

On one hot summer's day, at least so they say,
There came in a bus, a Volkswagen,
To the shop for repair, something broke under there,
But the poor mechs were now really dragging.

They were white as a sheet, but this job they'd complete,
That they promised the owner who waited.
Then they staggered and swore, as they opened the door,
Cranked the bus and drove in where it's shaded.

Well, the hours went by, til the closing drew nigh,
And the owner grew twitchy and nervous.
So he spoke to the boss, as he now was quite cross,
And inquired 'bout the length of his service.

&quot;Well, it shoulda been through,&quot; said the boss through his chew,
&quot;And I don't know what's taking so long.&quot;
So they walked through the door to the shop's working floor
And found the bus, as if nothing was wrong.

The ticket was there on the floor, which was bare
Except for a very large puddle.
But the mechs were not found anywhere near around,
Though the boss had searched all through the muddle.

Then the bus owner paid for the work that had made
All his broken parts mended again,
And he happily drove to his home in the grove
With no thought of the missing repairmen.

So the boss never knew what had taken his crew
&gt;From their jobs, which they left and deserted,
For they never returned for their tools or pay earned
Which in storage has since been inserted.

But the story that grew, from the people that knew,
When with beers in a bar they'd get belted,
Was those mech's didn't stray and are still there today:
The poor bastards had simply just melted.


      Oh, the stories we hear, like the stars in the sky,
         Have all been encountered before,
      But just when you think that you've heard of them all,
         A new one will drive through the door.

(Installment 3.0.0.0.0)

whatzat? one more? oh, awright. :)  most of you don't know that lots of
famous people wrote musicals about buses and vw's and such
..unfortunately,
none were ever made into productions that we get to see. however, some
were
adapted to less interesting subjects and became instant hits. one such
example is The Sound of Music, which was a watered-down version of the
original The Sound of Mufflers, a musical about a southern german family
who
invented volkswagens and drove them around the Alps, bringing joy and
happiness to the people of the region. never made it into production.
change
the central character from a Calamity Jane type of mechanic/inventer to
some
frilly nanny, throw in some love interest and a few nasty Nazi's and it
became a box-office smash.

well, little did you know that some of the original music was saved!
(before
it was corrupted by hollywood). and here's one of them ...


My Favourite Things
sung by Julius Andrews
in the hit musical, The Sound of Mufflers


CV joints greasy with new rubber booties,
Bright shiny bumpers for busses' patooties,
New Mahle pistons and new piston rings ...
These are a few of my favourite things.

Driving with foglights in rain when it drizzles,
Breakfast at campouts with bacon that sizzles,
Washing my bus and the shine that it brings ...
These are a few of my favourite things.

   When the gas drips,
   When the wrench slips,
   When I am feeling bad ...
   I just have to think of my favourite things,
   And then I don't feel so sad!

Driving cross-country on roads never taken,
Traveling on instinct, while maps we've forsaken,
Watching a hawk with the wind in his wings ...
These are a few of my favourite things.

Long conversations 'round campfires in autumn,
Watching the kids when they use what you've taught 'em,
Ignoring the phone while it rings and it rings ...
These are a few of my favourite things.

   When the gas drips,
   When the wrench slips,
   When I'm feeling bad ...
   I just have to think of my favourite things,
   And then I don't feel so sad!

and then there was Showbus! about a fellow who drove a spiffed up
split-window bus all around the country, carrying cargo and people
hither
and yon. couldn't sell the idea. but change the bus to an old
wood-burning
stern-wheeler riverboat, add a bunch of silly star-crossed lovers and
some
civil war stuff, and it was a hit (as Showboat). once again, some of the

original music survived ...

Ole Man Highway

    There's an old man that we call the Highway,
    That's the old man I want to be ...
    What does he care if your car's got troubles,
    What does he care if the toll ain't free?

Old Man Highway, that Old Man Highway,
He must know something, but don't say nothing.
He just keeps rolling,
He keeps on rolling along.

He don't haul taters, He don't haul cotton,
And them that hauls 'em is soon forgotten,
But old Man Highway,
He just keeps rolling along.

   You and me, we sweat and strain,
   Windshields all smeared up with bugs and rain,
   Climb that hill, at convoy's tail,
   Go a little fast, and you lands in jail.

I get weary and sick of driving,
My legs are aching and my eyes are crying,
But Old Man Highway,
He just keeps rolling along.

(last one, folks!)

remember to take notes! there'll be a quiz on Monday!

Hitchhiker's Lament
(sung to the tune of Streets of Laredo,
or Cowboy's Lament)

As I was out driving one morning for pleasure,
My bus and me riding one morning so fair,
I spied an old geezer beside of the highway,
A pack on his back and his thumb in the air.

There was something about him that gathered my notice,
A something familiar, and yet still unseen,
A spirit so kindred, I felt in a moment
That here but for god's grace was easily me.

I pulled to the shoulder and waved to him friendly,
He walked to the bus and he slowly got in.
I asked, &quot;Where you headed?&quot;  He answered, &quot;Out that way.
&quot;And I'm later than usual,&quot; he said with a grin.

In talking while riding, he told a sad story
Of trading two morrows for one yesterday,
And then he admitted that he once had buses,
And like his tomorrows, they faded away.

&quot;I once had a camper, a nice sixty-seven,
A neat little Microbus rolling along.
But the wife and I split up, I needed some money,
So I sold it to strangers for nearly a song.&quot;

&quot;My fortunes rebounded a year or so later,
But by then the buses lost most of their charm.
Still I bought me a Breadloaf and learned that I love it,
For it still was a Bus and could do me no harm.&quot;

&quot;After that, there were others, in lengthy succession.
A Vanagon camper I had for a while;
A Pickup, a Kombi, a Double-door Panel ...
I had always thought I'd be riding in style.&quot;

&quot;But fortunes and favors don't stay long at my house.
They find better lodging with others some day.
When I lost all my money, my job, and my buses,
That's when I packed up to try traveling this way.&quot;

&quot;As the years added to me, I wandered the country,
Searching and seeking and moving along.
Unsure of the way that my destiny pulled me,
I changed my direction like changing my song.&quot;

He talked for a long time to tell his life's story,
I listened intently to his sad refrain,
For his tale was spell-binding, no matter the sadness,
And he spoke as if knowing he'd rebound again.

My exit came up as we rode down the highway
So I pulled to the shoulder and bid him farewell.
He thanked me profusely and wouldn't take money
And waved at me til I had turned down the dell.

And as I was driving, my home road returning,
His last words were ringing around in my brain:
&quot;Enjoy this nice bus for as long as you have it,
You just never know if you'll have one again.&quot;
