Subject: Westy sink waterpump

I'm assuming that you have the manual water pump on your sink.  I have replaced the one in
my Brunhilda, my '73 Westy, twice.  It is pretty easy in the 'states, because we have lots
of people who own trailer campers, pop-up tent campers, etc., and they use the same kind
of pump.  So I just drove down to the local RV supply store and bought a replacement off
of the shelf.  Both fit fine.  It seems to be a standard size.  All you have to do to
replace it is to remove the two screws holding it down, carefully pull it up so you don't
lose the rubber feed hose that runs down to your water tank, pull the old one off, push
the new one on, stick it in the hole, and put the screws back in.  I seal the bottom of
mine with silicone seal to prevent leakage.  I haven't been to mainland Europe recently
(England last year...), but I used to live near Earlangen, Germany, and it seems to me
that with the number of campers in Western Europe, you should be able to find something
suitable relatively easily.
