&gt; I put the Bus Depot stainless muffler on my 1600 last summer. After a couple
&gt; of months of summer only running, it does show some rust. Tailpipe is also
&gt; rusty. Let me know if your original tailpipe fits on, Ron said it wouldn't.

it took a little enlargening the mounting holes to make it fit. was like
1/8 inch too wide but other than that went in great. including risers.

The old style tailpipe will require some modification. The diameter is
very slightly smaller, the new one has a flange to help it seal and the
mounting bracket is different. Welding a flange and a simple mount bracket
to the old tail pipe should make it work fine. Im not a fan of this new
baffleless one piece pipe ... I dont like how it sounds as much :)
and it sticks out further.

My old muffler had serious fall-apart. I had no idea it was that bad until
I took it out. 3 of 4 inlet pipes broken loose and one of the riser tubes
had holes rotted thru it.

Overall Im very happy with it. Also mad props to Ron and the depot. :)

peace

here is some info on passivization of stainless steel basically acid
washing the iron oxide off so the molecular magic of stainless can be set
free....
