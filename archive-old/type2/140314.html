Subject: Things that stink

Well got off work today after a busy day and jumped in the bus as usual turn
the keys got lights good crank her up and she roars to life as normal.... For
a split second that is. She immediatley dies with a slight electrical pop
sound towrds the end but not a bad pop . Then No lights, nothing. I check the
fuses they are fine. I think battery must off come loose or something. So I
jump out check the connections seem fine I tighten them up a little still no
lights. So I check the fuses with a test light no power to the fuse box mmmmmm
so I decided to clen the terminals and make sure they were good and
connecting. Finally get lights. I am thinking oh yeah I am headed home now.
Jump in and turn the switch nothing. Lights come on but no starter. So I jump
out and try using the jumper wire I have so I can start the bus from the rear
its just attached to the starter and I keep a wire nut on it. I touch it to
the battery and it sounds like the starter gear is spinning but not popping
out. So I decide to give the starter a whack. hewn I did this the starter
started whirling around again and it wouldnt quit. So I disconected the
ground. When I reconnected it it didnt do anything. So I tried the key nothing
but when I tried the wire it did the same thing. Wouldnt quit till I got the
ground off. So I am guessing my starter died and that was the pop I heard and
the battery might have caused the short to begin with..... I already have a
starter and I am gonna go out there tomorrow after work and replace it.
Anybody have any different ideas on what it could be.....
