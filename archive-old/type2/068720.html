&gt; 1) Asbestos - There are two plastic type tubes that connect the heat

That grey, fibrous, fire resistant stuff?  Yup, thats the stuff!
Asbestos as sure as shootin'!  So, what do you do about it?  I dunno.  I
have always figured it would keep the cigarette smoke from burning my
lungs so bad, but YMMV.  I have seen replacement tubes advertised in
various places that are said to be nonasbestos, and you can bet your
bottom dollar that any new one you buy today will be non-asbestos.  (note
to anyone selling NOS: charge enough to cover the lawyer you'll need later
:-).

On the other hand, asbestos in place is pretty benign, it's asbestos
stirred up that is dangerous.  Leaving them alone (until your next
engine swap) is probably less hazardous than changing them, unless you are
ready to do a full moon-suit cleanout on a lark.
