Subject: WTB: Hydraulic Rocker Arm Spacers
Message-ID: &lt;GOCBKOBAPEIMBAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

I think these are a junkyard only item, but I need a complete set of spacers for hydraulic rocker arms. In the absence of anyone having these, can anyone provide specs? I could have them made if I knew what I needed.

Thanks! Joe
