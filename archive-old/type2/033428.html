Nope, _you_ got it backwards. The current order (which is indeed that 2.0L
is better than 1.8L and 1.7L are the most despised...) is the case because
baywindow owners are more interested in driving buses than in collecting
them and showing off. The minute bays become valuable, I guarantee you,
it will turn around if only because there are so few 1.7Ls.
