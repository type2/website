Alan, 
I have the 67 and earlier shop manual for the bus that shows this.  That
bar was used for opening the rear hatch from the inside.  VW actually put a
small cable with a key ring on it (I actually can't remember if a cable was
used or the key ring went directly through the hole) so when you pulled the
key ring in released the hatch.  This was done stock to kombis that did not
come with rear interior panelling, as those were usually used for work trucks.

&gt;One of my fondest childhood memories is laying stretched out on the back
&gt;luggage shelf of my parents brand new '64 Deluxe on the way home from some
&gt;camping trip.  The warmth and soothing sound of the little engine just
&gt;beneath me was very comforting-I couldn't hear my parents arguing.  No
&gt;surprise I like sleeping in my 71 Westy.  But, one of the things that has
&gt;frustrated me every since then is not being able to get in and out of the
&gt;back hatch door.  I was always the last one to get out when we stopped at
&gt;McDonalds to get our 15 cent hamburgers!  
&gt;
&gt;I thought of putting a handle on the inside so that I could pull the door
&gt;closed once I'm in, but I still wouldn't be able to get out.  Sooooo, I took
&gt;the latch mechanism off and noticed there is a bar in it with a hole that
&gt;looks like it was made for an inside door latch/handle.  I can't think of
&gt;any other reason for it.  Was this ever offered as an option, or on non-US
&gt;models?  I understand the child proof aspect of having a door latch there
&gt;but, a kid should be buckled in anyway (thank goodness my dad didn't feel
&gt;that way back then).
&gt;
&gt;So, obviously not having enough to keep me busy this weekend, I made an
&gt;inside latch/handle for the rear hatch.  The handle part acts like a safety
&gt;cover so that it could never be opened accidentally.  It's about 3.5 inches
&gt;wide, 1.5 inches tall, and only sticks out 1 inch so it doesn't interfere
&gt;with the mattress pad.  Didn't have to ruin any original parts either.
&gt;Works great.  If only I had it back then..........
&gt;
&gt;Just a funky idea.
