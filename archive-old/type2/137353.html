Subject: Various busses for sale

Howdy - trying to clear out the parking lot...er, yard, a little
but...busses are in Raleigh, NC, and all prices are negotiable, and trades
are considered...
1977 automatic bus - runs, licensed &amp; on the road - FI, rebuilt 2 liter
with 60k, almost NO rust, but has a few dents, which are ugly but don't
affect door function or anything. has early bay westy interior. Asking
$1700, or make offer.

1971 Deluxe - no engine, ran when parked 3 years ago. Body fair, but
complete, all doors, windows, lights, etc are there...everything but the
engine. Great for parts, or roll it as a beater...asking $400/negotiable.

1970 Westy - factory non-poptop. Great interior, very little rust, but a
dent in the front corner which makes the door really hard to open
(passenger) rebuilt engine - 3k miles on bottom end, 20 miles on top end,
but carb is crusty, and it runs roughly... Asking $1800/negotiable

1960 standard - ran when parked 2 years ago due to brake problems. later
camper interior...some rust, but not  a lot for an old east coast bus...

 feel free to email me with questions...
thanks,
