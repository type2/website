Subject: oil pressure gauges

I would like to buy an oil pressure gauge to have in my tool box to detect
early signs of crank bearing wear.

In the various catalogs, I see electrical and mechanical versions of VDO
gauges.   How does each of these sense pressure?  Is one more accurate than
the other?

Jack
