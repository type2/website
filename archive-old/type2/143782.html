&gt; &gt; I've had this also and it came after I worked behind the dash. It could
&gt;
&gt; be as simple as the speedometer cable being loose where it inserts in the
&gt; back of the speedo. That's what mine was . It's important to get it lined
&gt; up right when you insert it and tighten the collar ring properly. It can
&gt; feel tight but isn't really if your not lined up.You can reach around from
&gt; the left (facing it) under the dash and get your hand on it. If the speedo
&gt; needle 'chatters&quot; or bobs a bit that's probably the problem.

Thanks, Peter....

I tried to line it up as best I could and it feels tight but I'll definitely 
get back there and check it out again.
