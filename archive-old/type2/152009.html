&gt; I see alot of German quality but no mention of made in Germany...

&gt; Went to a Cooper/Michelin tire dealer to have a tire patched on the
&gt; Cabrio on Saturday. Big banner inside proclaiming &quot;American Owned&quot; and
&gt; the second line said &quot;Quality Made&quot;. At first glance my brain read
&gt; &quot;American Owned&quot; for some reason. Nice way to say that the corporate
&gt; bigwigs at in the USA while the factories are in Mexico or some other
&gt; far away land.

well at least my Michelins say &quot;made in France&quot; on the side...I didn't
even think Michelin had a factory left in France...

&gt;
&gt; Used my &quot;Chicago Tool&quot; sander last night on a side note. Made in China...

it's very frustrating, we got a new commercial (not cheap window unit) air
conditioner in our office not long ago, and plastered all over it is
&quot;MAYTAG&quot; etc etc.  read the fine print   &quot;made in china&quot;   duh!
