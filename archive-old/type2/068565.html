Subject: Dr. Seuss (non-VW humour for Friday!)

&gt;&gt;If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
&gt;&gt;And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
&gt;&gt;And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
&gt;&gt;Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
&gt;&gt;And the double-clicking icons put your window in the trash,
&gt;&gt;And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
&gt;&gt;Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If the label on your cable on the gable at your house,
&gt;&gt;Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
&gt;&gt;But your packets want to tunnel to another protocol,
&gt;&gt;That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,
&gt;&gt;So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
&gt;&gt;Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
&gt;&gt;&quot;Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
&gt;&gt;And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
&gt;&gt;Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM,
&gt;&gt;Quickly turn off your computer and be sure to tell your mom!
