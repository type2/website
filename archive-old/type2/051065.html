Subject: [T2] Wanted: yet another 71 bus-just a little disapointed

[...]
Oh mighty list advisers,

I was just about ready to travel to Flagstaff Arizona to look/buy a 71
transporter w/converted westy interior. The owner sent me some fair looking
pics, said it was in perfect original condition, and wanted me to deposit
$4,500 into his bank account *first* and then go to Flagstaff and look/buy
it.

I called him and suggested that I would rather look at the bus first in
person, and then hand over the $$$$.  He said he was really in no hurry to
sell, and would only sell it, at his convenience, and if I deposited the
$$$$ into his account and then after seeing it I changed my mind, he would
give me back the $$$$.  Yeah, right!

Okay, I said I would fly out from San Diego * at my own expense* take a look
at it and then make my decision to buy it or not.

He just called me back, said he wanted to be sure he made a full disclosure
* since he is a lawyer * of everything before I traveled the over 500 miles
to buy it.  This was very nice of him.....

Now he proceeds to tell me about a few things that are not right with this
perfect condition original  bus. Like as in BTW, 1.  The gas gauge doesn't
work  *dealer said it was  the sending unit in the tank*... On a 71 wouldn't
that entail pulling the engine and the tank in order to repair it? Hmm. 2.
The front seats *under the sheepskins* are shot. 3.  The rear cushion over
the engine compartment has holes in it where the sun has hit it.  4.  The
kick panels in the front cab are shot  5.  The water pump for the sink
doesn't work. 6. Apparently a mechanic at the dealer, pulled the heat/fresh
air knobs out and didn't put them back in right *who knows what that looks
like*.. 7.  The front skin as well as the roof was repainted and doesn't
match the rest of the bus. 8.  All or most of the plastic edges on the
cabinets are cracked or broken. 9.  Had a fire in the engine compartment
near the battery, it was repaired but not repainted.

No truer statement has ever been said: Buyer Beware

I am looking again!!! If anyone has a very clean 71 transporter/or, camper
bus, they would like to sell, pmail me I have a buyer for it....
