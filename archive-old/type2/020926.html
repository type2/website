Subject: Next step in oil problem...thanks for the replys

First off thanks for all the replys. they were very helpful. 
First I am going to contact the engine builder who was pretty helpful in
the past and see what he says. Then I will inspect the oil pump gears
and see what I can find out. I really hope I can fix this problem and
not have to get a new engine which will prolong my already marathon like
engine installation.  The engine builder was Jeff Gervais who was in the
back of VW trends.  Thanks again for the responses
