&gt; Sorry, my procedure is for a Vanagon, not a Bus.  The Bus and Vanagon
&gt; use very different engine and transmission mounting methods.
&gt; 
&gt; The transmission on a Bus has a front mount but there are also two bolts
&gt; above where the tranny meets the engine that hold the tranny to the
&gt; frame.  These must come out in a Bus for the tranny to come out.  The
&gt; Vanagon does not have these bolts.  The Vanagon has a hydraulic clutch
&gt; (hence the slave cylinder) while the Bus has a cable-operated clutch (no
&gt; slave cylinder).  The Bus also has a different shift rod attachment
&gt; arrangement than the Vanagon, which has a side shifter attachment to the
&gt; tranny.
&gt; 
&gt; Other than that, they are fairly similar.  If you were just dropping the
&gt; engine and comparing between a Bus and a Vanagon you'd find them quite
&gt; similar but if you include the tranny it gets different fast.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought I had a procedure for pulling engine/tranny from a Bus on the
&gt; site as well as one for a Vanagon.  I may have to double check that.

&gt; Congrats on pulling it yourself, for me it is a 2-person job minimum!
&gt; As for pulling the tranny and then putting the engine and tranny back in
&gt; as one unit, most folks think that installing the engine + tranny is
&gt; easier than installing the engine alone.  But of course some weight is
&gt; added to the total package.  I'm not sure yet which method I prefer.
Sean:
Isn't it almost a necessity to remove the rear trans mount bolts to
properly remove and install an engine in a 72-79?
Seems like I tried it years ago and it was impossible without lowering
the rear of the trans. (No removeable rear panel like 68-71).
It's been at least 9 years, but that's what I remember.
