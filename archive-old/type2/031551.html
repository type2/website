&gt; &gt;Please Mr. or Ms. Parts Vendor:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1.  Don't lie to me.  If you're going to be dishonest, look out, I 
&gt; &gt;2.  Don't take me for granted.  You are not the only vendor out there.
&gt; 
&gt;  Steve brings up many good points for vendors to consider.  Among the
&gt;  biggest ones for me are being lied to and not giving their employees
&gt; power to fix problems.  There have been multiple occasions where I
&gt; everything I've asked for is in stock.  When I receive the shipment,

I always check on the stock status as a matter of course, frequently the
a part is out of stock,  if it is not a major part I just tell em to send
a partial shipment.  (I do get upset when there is a large shipping fee
for a small out of stock item, like studs or gaskets)


I have usually gotten the truth from the two vendors I deal with most
(which is why I deal with em) those are the Bus Depot and Rocky Mountain.

the Bus Depot seems to have better prices, and is a lot closer, I once
even drove up there for a part I was desperate for, wasn't a problem, but
250 miles each way for a seal I forgot was &quot;Crazy&quot; they were quite
accomodating....if you call the Service number, which I always do now,
then you will find someone who knows what their doing, more than once I
was reminded of a seal or gasket that I needed to make the part I was
buying work... the 800 number can't do that anywhere I've found

...their place sort of reminded me of my garage on a larger scale.....I'll
leave that to your imagination...;8*}

Rocky Mountain on the other hand almost always seems to have what I need
in stock, so if I REALLY need the part &quot;_NOW_&quot; I can pay to get it FedEx
from them.... yes I have paid $30 shipping on a $15 dollar part but that
is part of the game when your type 2 is your sole vehicle and daily driver

YMMV
Bob
