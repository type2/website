Subject: Re: Wrapped heat exchangers

About wrapped heat exchangers: 

All type-IIIs after 1967 had wrapped heat exchangers. The
wrapping material is very similar to the material
on the floorboards, and held onto the heat
exchanger with two or three aluminum bands.

I have three t-III heat exchangers, and all are like
that. They are in great shape, if totally oil soaked.
Plus, the parts of the heat exchangers that are
not covered with the oily diaper are toast.

I was thinking today of some type of coating
that could be painted onto the heat exchangers
to improve their insulation, like those diapers.
I guess epoxy impregnated asbestos is out of the
question? I wonder how hot that aluminum roofing
product can get? Header wrap sounds good, but wont conform
well to the strange shapes.
