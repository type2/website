&gt; Tom...... since you live in Calif, do you have a Calif or a Fed version 
&gt; bus?
&gt;
&gt; This makes a big difference in which wiring diagram you are looking at.
&gt;
&gt; Fed = points in the dist and a resister pack
&gt;
&gt; Cal = electronic ignition and NO resister pack

This is a Federal version engine.  I've never understood why they didn't 
create different wiring diagrams for California and Federal variations, but 
they didn't.  Instead, the California-only components - ICU, Oxy relay, 
etc. - are all there, but with an asterisk, indicating California-only. 
You'd think they'd also show an external resistor pack, with terminal 
numbers, and a double asterisk for Federal only, but they don't.
