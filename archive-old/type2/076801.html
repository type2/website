Subject: sevice in minneapolis??

I live in the Minneapolis area and am looking for a good shop to bring my 77 
westy to have some work done.  I have the engine tore down and in pieces on 
my work bench and don't have the time to put rebuild it myself.  Where is a 
good place to bring it in this area?  I called the VW Man in Minneapolis and 
he told me to call Good Carma.  I have heard that the VW Man does good work 
but have never heard anything about Good Carma.  Any info. would be helpful. 
  Thanks.

Adam
77 Westy
