Subject: Fw: [T2] The Saga of Mario Gavazzi comes to a head?

&gt; Things are still very busy here and I have a great # of good  customers.
I'm
&gt; sorry I can't make them all happy but its a very tough  business.

Hi Mario. It is indeed a tough business apparently, at least for you that
is. The # 1 google search result for &quot;Mario Gavazzi&quot; as well as the # 4
search result for &quot;Vintage Werks&quot; is this website chronicling your bad
relations with ex-customers... Presumably your lawyer would have sued John
Connolly (the websites registrant) for slander by now if you actually had a
leg to stand on in court.

www.mariogavazzivintagewerks_dot_com

John Connoly vs. Mario Gavazzi aka Vintage Werks Restoration - judgement in
plaintiffs favor $4,210.20

Gary Tateosian vs. Mario Gavazzi aka Vintage Werks Restoration - judgement
in plaintiffs favor $1,850

On the other hand a similar google search for Mark Dearing Salem Import
doesn't seem to find any stories about PO'ed ex-customers sueing him in
court, let along them winning judgements against him...
