Subject: Re: [T2] Fire! (long)

Anyone ever seen an electric valve that would shut off without the key on.

Could install it closest to the fuel tank and if you had fire, you could 
shut everything off and the fuel would be contained (for a while) by this 
valve.

That is instead of one of the lines burning through and spilling gasoline 
on the engine fire...

Aircraft supplier? Marine supplier?

Ciao!
