Subject: Re: fuel pressure gauge

I just bought a water pressure gauge from the hardware store: $4.95. Seems
to work just fine, even though it's $35 less than the fuel pressure gauge
sold at Sears or at the FLAPS.

&gt; One step in Bentley's diagnosis of FI problems involves the use of a fuel
&gt; pressure gauge.  Are these standard items at FLAPS?  Different from some
&gt; types of vacuum gauges which can read pressure as well as vacuum?
