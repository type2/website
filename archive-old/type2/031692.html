&gt; I'm preparing to troubleshoot my FI system using the excellent resource from

&gt; what &quot;ring main&quot; is in reference to the FI system.  It says to check the

the ring main is the fuel line in a fuel injected bus.  the fuel line is a
full circle running from the fuel tank, to the fuel pump and filter near
the left wheelwell. then through the firewall and in a horseshoe shape up
one side where two injectors are, accross the back of the engine where
near the Distributor there is the &quot;5th injector&quot; or cold start valve. it
continues across the back to the right side of the engine where two more
injectors are located  and then to the fuel presure regulator on the
right side of the firewall then through the fire wall and back to the fuel
tank.  (makeing a complete &quot;ring&quot; around your engine)

&gt; pressure here after pulling the hose off the air intake distributor.  I
&gt; think I know which hose to pull off?? but don't know where to connect my
&gt; pressure gauge.

there is usually a small tap with a bolt in it on the right side near the
injectors for cyl 1&amp;2 this is the suggested location for tapping in your
pressure gauge

&gt;  Can anyone help a newbie with his journey into the world of
&gt; FI diagnosis??  Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.

good luck, most problematic of the parts in the ring are in order

fuel filter (make sure it is on facing the right way and clean)
fuel pump, (does it run when it is supposed to)
presure regulator (presure too high/low, don't forget the vacuum line to
this)
