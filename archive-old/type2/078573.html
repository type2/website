These are the tires I run on my Nissan truck that does all of my hauling and 
pulling. They seem to hold up just fine under the wear and tear.

&gt;
&gt;I checked these tires out today.  Website didn't
&gt;list the load rating so I eyeballed them myself
&gt;at the store.  (I had to insist that the tire
&gt;teck let me see tire and read the sidewall
&gt;myself.)  Load index is 98 and 1695.  I forget
&gt;the max pressure but it was appropriate.  Price
&gt;is $45.00 + $9 for lifetime road hazard, stems
&gt;etc.  Worth a look for those of us looking for an
&gt;all terrain tread or not willing to put $150 per
&gt;tire for agilis.
