Subject: F/S 85 vanagon Cheap

I have an 85 vanagon GL blue with silver strip. I wont turn down any offer  
over $250
 
good things its in nice shape and 99% complete clear NC title, rust  free 
,real nice interior (blue).
 
Bad points bad engine and no clue about tranny
 
I will wait a few weeks before parting it out and using it as a storage  
unit...I hear there's something about space with them
 
if you have a rusty but good running one this would be the way to go.
