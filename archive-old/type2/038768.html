Subject: Air Shocks Found and Installed

Okay folks, all of you DM fans and Conventional Wisdom people can hit the 
delete key now and spare me the flames. For the rest, read on: Just installed 
(yesterday) a set of air shocks on my ' 78 Westy(Delux version, w/dual batts 
and tons of extra equiptment) My T-bars were adjusted correctly to begin 
with, and I did not have a bad case of saggy butt, but with all the extra 
stuff I drag along with me, I wanted something to keep my ride height level. 
I had a set of coil-overs on the bus, and they did fine( they've been on 
there for over 30k miles, and have seen some absolutly Horrible roads, w/out 
a problem) but I really wanted a way to set the ride height to suit my ever 
changing moods. The answer was NAPA part# MA758, air shocks, at 81.49 for the 
complete kit, including all air lines and related fittings. The things took 
about two hours (and three beers) to install. Everything went off without a 
hitch. One note: If you are not already running coil-overs, you'll need to 
get a couple of spacers, and two longer bolts for your top shock mounts. The 
air shocks seem to handle quite well on paved roads, as well as the two 
logging roads I just got back from driving on. I simulated 600lbs of gear 
with bags of concrete I had in the garage, and inflated the shocks to 
95psi.(max rated is 150psi.) Then I tried to really hurt the shocks/upper 
mounts. Beat the hell out of everything for about four hours. No problems. 
I'm heading back up to the mountains on fri. afternoon, and am going to do my 
best to push the shocks/upper mounts to their limit. I'll report back the 
results on mon.
Take care,
Parker
