Subject: 009 distributer question

I have a brand new bosch 009 distributor that came with various other parts in a box when i bought my bus way back when.  the 009 is in its original box and ready to be installed, but I wanted to make sure the 009 can go in any air cooled vw motor.  I have a 72 bus with a 1700 type 4 engine.  Can the 009 go in my bus or are there different 009's for different types of motors?
