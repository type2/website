Subject: [T2] 1.7 Type 4 in a pre 1972 bus?

I have read that this was an option in all models except trucks. Anyone ever
seen such a bus? Would love to know what the tin looked like. Anyone ever
put a Type 4 motor in a 1968 to 1971 bus (excluding the type4 upright
conversion kit with the Porche 911 fan set up)?
