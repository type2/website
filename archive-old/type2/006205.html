Greetings, all-

While we are on the subject of oil temps and such, the PO of my bus had
purchased but never installed an oil pressure sending unit which apparently
sends to an electronic guage. There is a 'T' fitting also that I assume
allows for the guage sender and the dash light sender to both be installed.
There is also a temp sender, a tiny little thermocouple with one wire
terminal, rated for 0 - 300F. No installation instructions!

Any suggestions on how/where to install these beauties? and where do I get
an electronic oil pressure guage? None of the parts houses around here carry
them.

Thanks,
Dave
