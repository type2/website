&gt;O.K., I've about 4 months before hot weather returns (maybe 5 - and we're
&gt;still gonna hit the 80s today), and the wife sez that A/C is a must have in
&gt;the '73 Westy. Even with a 1.8L (insted of the 1.7L that a '73 should have)
&gt;I'm leery of putting all that equipment on the engine. Has anyone installed
&gt;an A/C unit like you find in motorhomes (all electric - no engine mounted
&gt;compressor)? How much power does one of these puppies take to run?

Too much, unless you are parked and plugged into shore power.  However,
it's not all that difficult to put regular old engine driven A/C in a '73
bus.  I just got done doing it.  At the last Lone Star Transporter meeting,
I was all set to show it off when I was upstaged by another member who had
DUAL A/C newly installed into his 71 Westy!!  Yes, front and rear A/C with
an upright engine.  Now I truly believe that anything is possible.  I did
mine myself using junkyard/used parts and it cost me around $400.  He had
his professionally installed and I was scared to ask what it cost him but
I'm guessing easily $1500+.  So depending on how much work you want to do,
it would either be expensive or outrageously expensive to put A/C into your
bus, but certainly not impossible.
