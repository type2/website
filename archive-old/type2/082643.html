Subject: Re: [T2] wired open heater boxes

Mike,
Just pumps in warm air all the time, that's all.  I wired mine open through
November/December, and released them at the beginning of January.  No
need now, in the warm SoCal air.  It's much more convenient to wire them
back to the levers so that you have the option of lukewarm air or not
rather than full-time air.

It's an easy job in our busses (early bays) as long as the lever cables
are still there.  Pick up some barrel nuts to attach your lever wire
ends to the flap arms on the heater box.

I've never had to run the lever cables before, but it wouldn't be my
first choice of jobs.

Good luck,

Simon Ramirez Jr.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; First, I just want to thank all of you who have so patiently answered
&gt; my 
&gt; questions as I rebuild my bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting ready to put my engine back in the bus, and I remember
&gt; when I 
&gt; took it out, the heater boxes were wired to the frame in the open position.
&gt;  
&gt; Why would the previous owner(s) do this?  Are hooking them back up
&gt; to the 
&gt; dash levers a difficult job?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!
