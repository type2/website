Subject: [T2] Wind powered Batt charging

I pull a small Scamp trailer with my bus and I have seriously bounced around
the idea of either a wind charger or solar to keep my batteries topped off
when camping without hookups.

Granted the windcharger will put out some serious watt's, but read the fine
print, the blades won't start turning until 10mph wind and at that speed,
the watt's are just a trickle.  Only if you are camping in a constantly
windy area such as the coast would the charger put out much.  Also, the
charger takes a little to set up, not like a permanent mounting on a boat.

The solar panel on the other hand will charge all day, doesn't need to be
set up and will work while on the way to the campout and on the road home.
Granted, if you camp in the shade (and that's the best place) you won't get
much output.

I guess David's right, it would be nice to have both, but I think I'll add
the solar first, less work in the long run.

&gt;&gt; I have a 25 watt solar panel and you can get panels of much larger output
&gt;&gt; capacity at a reasonable price.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that depends on what one's idea of &quot;reasonable&quot; is.  They have come down
&gt; to a little under $4/watt, but that is still a lot of money.
 
&gt; Not saying I'm in favor of wind, just pointing out that it does have some
&gt; advantages.  In a perfect world, I'd have both.
