Subject: [T2] Tow Bar

A few months back in VW Trends there was an article featuring a tow bar for
the Type 2s from a vendor in AZ I think.  I don't subscribe, I just read it
while at Borders.  Does someone know who the vendor is?  The archives
mention this but I didn't see the vendor named, just a heated debate
regarding using the muffler clamps that I grew tired of reading.  Off-list
response is fine.  Thanks,

j a clary
