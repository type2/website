&gt;I might tool over in Sally...  How big is this show?
&gt;
&gt;Teri
&gt;
&gt;The show is one of the best on the west coast, always covered by the VW
mags in the U.S. and Europe. It is at the San Jose Historical Museum that
is part of Kelley Park. Lots of grass and trees BUT the cool part is that
the Historical Museum consist of Historical buildings from San Jose that
have been moved to the park and placed in a small town setting. The bulk of
the cars in the show are placed on the streets in this old town
setting(including a working candy store, Malt shop, and the coolest old gas
station that you can park your bus in and take a picture if your patient
enough). It started as a vintage only show but has progressed to all genres
of VW(air cooled only). There is a HUGE swap meet and all the major VW
parts houses show up. There is a childrens zoo and small amusement park
next door called Happy Hollow that will amuse children 10 and younger and
there is also the Japanese friend ship gardens if you want to wander over
and feed some hungry giant Koi.
&gt;

&gt;And don't forget the BYOB(bring your own bus)show the day before(4/21).
It's in Prunedale about 40 minutes south of San Jose on 101. Its put on by
a split club(Strictly Vintage 2s) but the swap and show is Bay compatible.
