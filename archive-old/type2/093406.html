Subject: Gauge selection - design - advice

OK, the list can feel as having been a very functional part of my decision to -
install three (3) gauges for:
Oil temp
Cylinder Head temp
Oil Pressure.
These will be installed in a 3 gauge pod (VDO p/n 110871-3) on the top of 
dash, so as to be a heads up view for myself.

I will also install
3.125&quot; gauge for RPM using a VDO adapter ring p/n 220-09101.
This gauge will be installed in the dash where a clock would have normally 
been installed.

AA)
There are several styles of VDO gauges available,
but if I elect to install the CHT in the pod and have it match the other 
2.0625&quot; installed gauges for OT and OP,
I take it I must confine my small diameter gauge style selection to Cockpit 
or Series 1 (traditional).
Correct ?

BB)
For the tach, since it is an installation separate from the others, I can 
select another style.
For this, I am wondering if the Vision design using back lit fiber optics 
on the pointer and numerals might not be the better choice?

CC)
Is CHT available in Vision style?

DD)
Has anybody out there seen all three styles of gauges, and if so, how would 
you compare them as to beauty and visual impact ?
