Subject: Re: [T2] Stumped! No power-1641 DP

&gt; Maybe some leftover sediment from the rusty gas tank is partially 
&gt; clogging a
&gt; fuel line .... it would idle  but not have enough fuel for highway 
&gt; speeds
&gt;
&gt; P.S. -- I assume you've check rolling resistance

As for the fuel pump, I turned the motor by hand and gas spewed out.  
Also, It doesn't have the familiar attribute of fuel starvation.  Motor 
doesn't cut out, only doesn't accelerate.  Rolling resistance-- well I 
can push the bus by hand--tires OK.  Sediment--I did replace the fuel 
lines, fuel filter looks clean.

Gotta go to work now, but will catch up tom'w.  Thanks.
