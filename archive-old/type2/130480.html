&gt;I think it is nearly impossible to get to the upper trans mounts
&gt;near the bell housing, as the head side faces where the starter/top of
&gt;tranny is, and the nuts hide where you can't see them unless the engine
&gt;is out!

The nuts are welded onto the transmission carrier so you only have to deal with getting your hand up in there and undoing the bolt by feel.

&gt;Worse, how do you line them up when rejacking the combo up -
&gt;will the holes magically line up when the nose and rear carrier are
&gt;rebolted?  This idea seems good for a 71 bus, but a late bay??

With the engine supported by the engine carrier clips and the nose of the transmission by it's support, lining up the hole isn't hard.
