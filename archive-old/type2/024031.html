Hello everybody,

I do, indeed, have the b*g firewall tin on my 1600dp in my 70 Westy. Thank
you everyone who sent advice. I have ordered one form the Old Volks Home and
await its arrival. I have a question though (of course). I have replaced the
Firewall seal with a nice new one, but when I reinstall the engine, does the
firewall go under it or against it ? I searched the Archives and found this
exact same question, but no answer. As always, thanks in advance for your
wisdom and patience.

Jeff
