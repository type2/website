&gt; I'm perhaps not as upset about this as you and others are, Richard. As
&gt; long as it is maintained properly, a bus should go on passing smog
&gt; indefinitely. And I tend to think of a baywindow bus as &quot;timeless&quot;
&gt; rather than &quot;classic.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; It is irritating, though, to have the goalposts moved when you're
&gt; within ten yards of the end zone.


My problem with these laws is parts availability. While engines for
ACVW's will probably be around forever (or darned near), the smog
components won't. How much longer do you think PCV valves, EGR valves,
air pumps, etc, will be available?
