Subject: Bus spotting: hulkamania

Can anyone confirm or deny what I think I've been seeing: in the ads for the
Hulk movie, you see part of a yellow &amp; white bus behind and uphill of Hulk as
he smashes the street. I've seen it a few times, and my wife saw it too and
said: look at the yellow bus!  Mine's yellow &amp; white, and has hulk stickers,
so we thought it was pretty funny.

Mat
