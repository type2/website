&gt; 4900 lbs?!?  Does your bus really weigh that much?  Mine only weighs 4000
&gt; and that's with the highroof, fridge, deep cycle batteries, tools, and
&gt; camping gear.  Oh, and really heavy tires (BFG All-Terrain TA).
&gt; 

Ya know, i might have read the sticker on the door wrong, but i feel like
thats right.

Anybody close to a 1974 kombi - just a bus, not the camper?

Check the door sticker for the weight - GAWR or something like that.

thanks folks,

clark
