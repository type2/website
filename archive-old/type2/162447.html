Subject: Re: [T2] Tail-light LED working!

SUCCESS!!!

well I have phutzed with it for a couple years off and on and I finally
got a really nice LED tail light that looks perfectly stock on a late bay
only about a dozen times brighter.

will be at JBB, and will try to write it up.  only did tail and brake
lights. I thought the back up and turn signal lights were bright enough at
this time..  maybe later
