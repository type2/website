Subject: Re: [T2] messy wiring

I tried something that worked out well for me when I cleaned up the wiring 
in my boat, and have used it since on allot of my projects. Take several 
pictures of whatever you are about to mess with/remove/move from several 
angles.  It's cheap for me because I have a digital camera, but it shouldn't 
kill your wallet even if you have to buy a disposable camera.  This way, if 
It doesn't work after you are done, you can put everything back where it was 
or at least get a good idea of what wire connected to what terminal.
This saved my butt big time on the boat, and also once when I couldn't 
remember how to get the steering wheel button back on my 70 type I.
