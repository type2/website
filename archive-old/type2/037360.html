|Saturday afternoon {18 Mar}  I looked at an 87 Syncro on a farm near
|Easton, Maryland.  Its owner now lives in California.  The Syncro is
|being sold by the uncle of the owner, a very nice gentleman who told
|me he has been trying to sell for ~3 months now.  The owner, Kelly,
is
|probably in the 20-30 age range and used the Vanagon in connection
|with his interest in bicycling.
|
|Asking price $4500; trans 4-sp manual plus low range; color silver
|blue; upholstery reasonably clean blue tweed; overhead A/C shrouds
|yellowing; body pretty straight... although driver's door has been
|repainted (maybe replaced?) and paint does not quite match; there are
|scuff marks on the left side aft of the driver's door [may or may not
|buff-out?].  There is little visible rust -- only a few seams show ~1
|cm of bubbling.  Chrome+rubber bumpers show some slight deformations,
|but generally look good.  Trim level is GL....  NOT a Westy.
|
|Odo reads ~110,000 miles.  Uncle says the A/C works and the engine
and
|trans were rebuilt, but does not know when or by whom.  The engine
|compartment is not 'tidy' so I would guess the engine rebuild took
|place at least 20,000 miles ago.  The driving qualities seemed OK
when
|tested on a country road up to 35 mph; there was an unaccustomed
noise
|in the power steering at first.
|
|That's all the info I have at the moment.  I'm up to my eyeballs in
|other projects, so if anyone on the List is interested, p=mail me and
|I will get the owner's Calif tel# for you.
