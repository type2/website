Glad you asked.  Of course you can use something totally different and 
considerably cheaper!  For less than the price of that Optima, I just 
bought FOUR lightly-used Hawker SBS C-11's:

92 amp-hours, 15 year lifespan, sealed.  These are great batteries and 
can be found on E-B*y, or at an electronics surplus store which is where 
I got mine.  I am going to mount one or two of these pups sideways 
underneath my bus (next to the frame rails) since they are only 4&quot; 
thick.  A great use of otherwise wasted space, I'm thinking.

Or, you could just go to Sams/Costco and get a garden-variety deep-cycle 
RV/Marine battery or a pair of 6V Golf cart batteries (just don't put 
them inside the vehicle).
