Subject: BN4-heater

a few days ago I posted a little recount of how I pulled my engine out but I
was wondering what that sausage was on the left side of the engine
compartment was.  I got a few answers back that it was a BN4 heater and
apparently I'm quite lucky to be the proud owner of one.  Well how does it
work, where are the controls for it?  I searched the archives and I couldn't
really find anything except for a few descriptions of what this 'hot-dog'
looks like.  Where are the controls for it and what else do I need to know
to get it working.  Now that my engine is in the basement can I play around
and try and get the heater working or is it somehow intimately related to
the engine.  Thanks in advance.
