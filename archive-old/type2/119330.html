Subject: Tempeh and Bus Apathy in SFBA

&gt; what the heck is a tempeh?

Tempeh is a Japanese fermented soy bean cake (not to be confused with 
natto, with is a Japanese fermented soy bean stinky-goo-pile).  It can 
be used as a meat substitute (or not; it's pretty good in its own right 
:-)

When I was in university, there was a Chinese restaurant in town that 
would do General's Chicken with tempeh instead of chicken; it was 
absolutely delicious.

You should be able to find tempeh at any asian market or natural food 
store.  It's also easy to find recipes for it.  Deborah Madison has a 
great cookbook called _Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone_ with several 
terrific tempeh recipes in it.  Don't be afraid of this cookbook if 
you're not a vegetarian (I'm a dedicated meat eater, but I use recipes 
from this cookbook 3 or 4 times a week).

Bus content to follow below...

&gt; Why is it that I never see any west coast camping get togethers?  I
&gt; know for a fact that there are some bus oriented camping groups here
&gt; in Oregon,.. dunno if they would accept the presence of a lowly
&gt; standard non westy bus driver though.  I see meets and cruises up in
&gt; Washington state, but nada in Oregon.  Go figure...

I am trying to get a VW camper group together in the San Francisco Bay 
Area, but you would not believe how difficult this is.  I have tried 
creating a &quot;community&quot; for this on orkut_dot_com (some may remember my 
solicitation for members a while back), but once people get signed up 
for it, there seems to be very little interested in actually keeping up 
with it (as evidenced by my attempt to get a carabus from SFBA -&gt; Los 
Osos / San Simeon together, and getting exactly one response ... 
looking forward to it, Larry! ... I just gotta get my fuel tank problem 
dealt with.)

I'm thinking of abandoning orkut_dot_com in favor of resurrecting 
sfbaywindows_dot_com (Chris Renz's old domain from an attempt to do the 
same when he lived in San Francisco) and running a more traditional 
&quot;enthusiast&quot; web site from it.

I have also tried leaving notes under windshield wipers when I 
encounter Busses parked around the streets of San Francisco (in my 
neighborhood and other neighborhoods that I visit).  Some of these 
Busses I see time and time again, but I have a 0% call-back rate when a 
note is left.

It's a little depressing... I see literally dozens of VW Busses and 
Vanagon campers every week in San Francisco, but it seems as though no 
one cares at all about getting together with other Bus / Vanagon 
owners.
