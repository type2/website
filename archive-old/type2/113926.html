I've heard this said but never seen them in any bus motor other than my own (and they were only there because I put them there).

&gt; they
&gt;are still available, but they are very expensive, maybe four times the price
&gt;of normal valves.

Even more than that!  Last time I checked they were over $100 for a set of four.  I paid $6 each for mine but that was ~13 years ago.

&gt;you can only use these valves if you have the right heads, 1.8l, or if you
&gt;have head work done to other heads, as the sodium valves are 34mm head
&gt;diameter, which is larger than the 33mm valves used on most tIV heads.
&gt;another info tidbit is that they use a bigger valve clearance, 0.008&quot;.

In addition, you can identify sodium valves by the dimple in the center of the valve face (the side that is in the combustion chamber).  I have heard mixed reports on these valves, which led me to go back to good quality stainless steel valves instead.  Apparently the reduced thickness in the stem can lead to them breaking?  Not sure if that's accurate but it  was enough to get me to abandon them.  You might say, &quot;But they use sodium-filled valves in the Porsche 914!&quot;.  While this is true, the stem diameter of the 914 valve is much larger (and therefore stronger).  It looks like it was designed to be sodium-filled whereas the bus valve looks like they took an existing valve size and hollowed it out, making it weaker.  I can see how they might be prone to breaking.
