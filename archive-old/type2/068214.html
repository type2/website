        Chris,
        Thom's spot-on about peeling back the mats, checking the
battery tray and using a battery charger to check the
electricals. Be nice and use a 6V charger unless the seller swears
its 12V AND connects the 12V charger AND takes responsibility for 
what might happen! :) 12V charger might blow-up 6V bulbs.
        
        With no engine you can't drive it but you CAN do quick
functional checks of the parking and regular brakes, check the 
wheels/bearings ala Muir, bounce-test the shocks. If the clutch
cable is connected to the throw-out-operating-lever you can try
the clutch pedal too. You'll put in a new clutch with the engine
you install.

        Crawl around everywhere under this bus, looking for
evidence of repaired (or not!) collision damage, rust and
corrosion, missing pieces, shiny places where metal is wearing
against metal. There should be a cover under the pedal/shift/parking
brake lever workings up front. There should be rubber plugs in the
inspection holes in the brake backing plates, and little caps over
the brake bleeders. Brake pedal should be firm, and have a shorter
travel if you set the parking brake. There shouldn't be anything
wet under the master cylinder, wheels or transmission. 

        Look for rust damage anywhere water can collect- under
the mats inside, at the lower edges of the windows, bottom edge of
the doors, rockers, the corners of the wheel boxes.

        This bus has probably been repainted. Did they do a good job? 
The engine compartment should be the same color as the outside, not
black or grey. Ditto the metal visible from inside.

        Sad to say, check the serial numbers on the mfg's plates behind
the front seats AND wherever they're punched into the body- Thom would
know, probably back by the engine. Needless to say, they should
be the same AND make sense for what the vehicle is and is said to be.
And the paperwork you get should have the same numbers.

        Finally, when budgeting allow for 2-3X more than you expect.
And remember that any used car can have $500 worth of stuff wrong
that you'll have to fix before you feel good. You know the engine's
gone, maybe the brake cylinders and shoes need to be replaced too.
Maybe there's severe rust in the battery tray that needs fixing.
These are not automatic &quot;NO&quot; triggers IF you're able to pay for
the repair and know its coming.

        Happy motoring!
        Bill
