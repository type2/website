Subject: Re: [T2] POR 15

Terry,

More explanations on the &quot;band-aid&quot; part?  I know that you are
probably an excellent paint/body guy(I've saved lots of your posts), but 
why do all the paint/body guys hate this stuff and everyone who uses it loves it?

I would not consider POR-15 a band-aid unless used as such.

I have used it to paint a lot of items that I just flat out
did not want to ever rust again....generally by sandblasting them first
and then applying the por-15.  Things like my shift rod, internal steering
column, seat springs, brake master cylinders, vacuum booster, tie rods,
spring plates and covers, brake backing plates, etc. Next project, my 
front axle beam...what would *you* use to paint your axle beam with so
as not to ever worry about it rusting again?(and doing the job over and 
over?)

Yes, if you wire brush the rust off and still have rust pits, the finish
will still show some rust pits...but it will *never* rust again....at 
least as long as I have been using it(about 4 years now).

I used it underneath my windshield because I did *not* have pinholes, but 
did have some rust pits.  I wire brushed, filled in the bigger rust pits
with some of their &quot;putty&quot; type material and then sanded it all down 
again.  Yes, there were some minor rust pits left when I painted it with 
por-15, but I am *certain* that I will not have to do that job again or 
worry about it as long as I have that bus.  And I doubt that I or anyone 
else will ever see the minor rust pits unless the rubber has to be changed
again on the windshield.

Cheers, Dave

&gt; Darren,
&gt; Here's my thoughts on the POR stuff--
&gt; 
&gt; It's a band aide,condom, fast way to no  correct end result.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes--it'll mask the surface rusted area--but it won't repair it---it
&gt; won't cause it to be factory new,nor look that way.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a stop gap measure till you either can afford the correct
&gt; refinishing proceedures, or until the next guy down the road get's it--
&gt; 
&gt; And in my professional opinion, not the right path to take--
&gt; I's much rather do the job once and be done with it--and the proper
&gt; way--
&gt; 
&gt; Later,
