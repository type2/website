Subject: Split my first case!

So after a couple pries with a crowbar..KIDDING KIDDING.  I wonder how
many people cried after reading that ;)

Honestly, it only took a few dozen taps with rubber mallets to get
this sucker to pop open.  I was actually shocked at how easy it was
(after finding that elusive last bolt).  I seem to have a small issue
though.  It seems the rubber seal behind the fan is stuck to the right
side of the case (left side is bolted to the stand), so when I try to
pull the right side of the case off, the seal gets snagged on the
tapered nose/end of the crankshaft.  Any tips on getting that seal
off?  Hope that make sense..

Thanks in advance
