&gt; I have a '72 Bus (station wagon), putting a '71 engine in it.  The engine 
bay

to 
&gt; how to put tin around the engine and bay area to seal it off, and how 
&gt; important is it to do this.

Buy the correct VW tin - availlable from www.justkampers_dot_com and I'm sure 
many others

Good luck
