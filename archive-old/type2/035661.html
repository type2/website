Subject: To weld or not to weld that is the question ...

Hi list,

Well thanks to your help, Wally, our 73 westy is pretty much naked of
interior and cab and is awaiting a variety of panels to replace the nasty
rusty ones. They include door skins, full front panel, cab floor,
windscreen repair corner and the ever needed new battery tray. Now having
forked out for all that lovely fresh metal, what to I do? Personally, I
would love to weld it in myself, BUT i have never welded before. Obviously
I need tuition, but there are no local colleges to help. So, it's teach
myself time. The big question is am I simply fooling myself that I could
teach myself to weld good enough to make Wally look decent, or am I more
likely to burn holes in the new panels and the van?
I checked the archives for info, and found some interesting looking books
(Welding Principles and Applications and also Welding Skills and Practices)
which I will look into. Are there any more teach yourself books? How much
practice will it take? Any suggestions on what to practice on?
I am prepared to buy the kit needed, but should I just call in a 'little
man' to do it? Will it matter if the little man does know VWs?

Questions, questions....

Thanks for the help

Darren
