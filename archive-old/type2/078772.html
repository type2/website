Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

&gt; Moral of this story: The Porter-Cable 333VS is the
&gt; best random-orbit sandah
&gt; on the market.

...unless you have an ayuh compressah...

I've nevah owned an 'lectric random oh-bit sandah that
worked as well as an ayuh-driven model. That ayuh's
just wicked goo-ud. 

Plus, your significant othah will see it like a chahm
bracelet - there's always anothah ayuh tool you can
get for your buurthday, X-mas, or (fill in your own
gift-givin' holiday he-ah)

John Cloonan, formahly of Yo-ahk, Maine.
