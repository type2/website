&gt; hi all - last week i got around to replacing the shift rod coupler.
&gt; shifting improved, but now i have a new issue. ain't that the way it 
&gt; is? on
&gt; the test drive i found i have a whine sound that happens in 4th gear 
&gt; at 50
&gt; mph. the sound is like a jet plane taking off, or really loud snow 
&gt; tires.
&gt; when i back off the accelerator the sound instantaneously disappears, 
&gt; but
&gt; reappears at 50mph.

The transmission in my '76 Westy also whines a bit.  Remember Grover 
from Sesame Street?  I imagine Grover making &quot;car sounds&quot; with that 
voice of his when I hear my tranmission noise ... &quot;rrrrrrr!  rrrrrrrrr! 
rrrrrrrrr....&quot;.  I talked to Marco at Buslab about it.  His opinion was 
that a transmission that is whining can still have years of service 
left in it.  I'm changing the gear oil with Redline MT-90 in the hope 
that a high-quality gear oil might erk some extra life out of it before 
it requires a rebuild, and possibly quiet down the whine a little.

I believe that the whining comes from a bearing in the final drive.  In 
my case, the whine happens only when engine power is being applied to 
the wheels, and it happens in all gears.  Wheels coasting or the &quot;slack 
spot&quot; right between constant speed and engine braking, the whine is not 
present.

It's a little annoying, but not that bad, and I'm not going to panic 
about it.  The transmission shifts smoothly (though I do need to fix my 
shift coupler; there's a lot of slack in the shifter), and there are no 
growls or thunks that might indicate some more serious problems.  It 
certainly runs like a top...
