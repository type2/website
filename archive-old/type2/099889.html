&gt;GL-4 is not expensive.  It is just a tad bit hard to find.  I found it NAPA.
&gt;There was a great explanation somewhere about why GL-4 is needed, something
&gt;about the brass synchronizers dissolving in GL-5 trans fluid.

There are some posts of mine in the archives on this. From what I can tell GL-5 is bad for yellow metals (brass synchros) in manual transmissions but GL-5/MT-1 is ok.  I confirmed this in email exchanges with techs from Amsoil and Swepco. I put in some Swepco last July to put it to the test. Plain old MT-1 without the GL-5 designation isn't suitable for cars.
