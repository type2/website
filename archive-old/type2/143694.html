Subject: vacume check on distributor

Hi,


I set the timing to 7.5 BTDC on my 1974 bus and pulled
the vacume hose of the flat part of the distrubiutor
(retard hose).  It made no difference to my advance or
idle.  I also noticed that the hose does have a
considerable amount of suction when i put my finger
over it.  How do i check the disributor vacume system?
 

Also does anyone know where to find a clear vacume
hose diagram for 1974 bus.

Also I have a new 0 231 178 009 distributor with an
electronic iginition in it instead of points.  Will
this work with the 1974 bus?  A friend gave it to me
one day.

Thanks,
