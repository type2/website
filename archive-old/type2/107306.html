Subject: Re: Buzzing dimmer relay

I guess there could be something odd with the turn signal switch wiring.
If you have a voltmeter check the switch signal and input voltage to the
dimmer and see if one dips down with the flasher signals.

Andy,
I'm pretty much a laymen when it comes to wiring and what you wrote doesn't 
make much sense to me. I can tell you the my turn signal switch was broken and 
all the wires were re-saudered to the switch, but I'm pretty sure I got it 
correct. I have a second switch and matched the wires up. 
Whats weird is that if you hook the ground wire from the turn signal switch to 
the S pin on the dimmer relay it seems to work. But where then is the switch 
getting it's ground from? And then the Brn/Wht wire is dangling.
