Subject: f/ Zorm (58 Single Cab) meets the BOSS! 

Hi all,

Got a call from my departmental director here at work from his mobile phone:

&quot;Jon, you've got to come out into the parking lot and see this highly
modified old VW Bus!!  I've never seen anything like it before, it's
really WILD!!!&quot;

I replied, &quot;Yeah, I've seen it because I've been driving it to work!
VW made VW trucks like that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, well its really cool!&quot;

Zorm must be gleeming with pride, metallic teal paint and all!  8-)
