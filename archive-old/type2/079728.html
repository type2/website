Subject: RE: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

&gt; Assuming I get a rebuilt from AVP, can I just order an 1800 engine, even
&gt; though it has the holes in the head and is made for a smog pump?


Yes.  We sell AVP's engines, and always sell 1800 engines to people who have
1700 engines.  The cost is the same, the engine is a direct swap, and the
core deposit is low enough that we just sell them outright; it's not worth
sending back the core.  AVP can supply the engine without smog pump holes.
