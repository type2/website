&gt;       Indeed the laws of thermodynamics say that mechanical energy is eventually 
&gt; changed into heat.

Oh I agree more heat probably comes from the combustion but you have a 
couple non-sequitors marring your argument a bit.  Mechanical energy 
might well turn into heat but not in the engine.  Tires heat up.  Body of 
the bus heats up from the air.  Brakes heat up.  Just about everything 
heats up.

Why the combusiont makes the engine hot is some from the friction of the 
engine parts but much more from the burning.  combusiont is fire and fire is 
heat for the most part.  A major concern in engine design is how to turn 
as much of the energy stored in the fuel into mechanical energy by 
increasing the efficancy of the conversion between chemical potential 
energy into mechanical.  The more lost through heat the less efficient.

Chemical potential energy is converted into heat energy.

Heat energy expands the compressed fuel and air into smoke and stuff that 
want much more room to &quot;vibrate&quot;.

This heat expansion is converted into mechanical energy.  But not all of 
it.  Much is still heat in the engine itself.

Some of the mechanical energy is converted back into heat by friction in 
the engine.
