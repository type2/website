Subject: heater aux blower fan

A couple of days ago when it was cold as hell here my aux heater blower 
fan decided to stop blowing.  On closer inspection the 16a fuse in the 
engine compartment had melted a little bit on one end.  The fuse didn't 
pop, but it certainly melted enough to make it not work.  I replaced the 
fuse and made it through the really cold spell (one more day / one more 
melted fuse).  I've checked the connection under the dash, and 
everything is making contact and looks as I think it should.  Does this 
sound like a wiring problem or is the fan dead or dying?  I bought this 
fan used (it was expensive!) around three months ago, but I've only used 
it a small handful of times.  I've heard rumors that these have been 
replaced with a similar squirrel cage fan used in bilge pumps in boats.  
Does anyone know if that is a drop in replacement, or does the plastic 
blower unit that the fan attaches to need to be modified or replaced?  
Any ideas on cost of these bilge motor fan things?  I don't need much, 
but I do need some forced air at idle.
