This is unbelievable. I can not remove the old heater cables to replace
then. The sheath is fused to the inside of the cable tubes. (yes, I made
sure a corner of the cable end was not caught on the tube, and they are
disconnected-lol).

I even hooked them to my 3/4 ton ford and backed away.. just kept
breaking closer and closer.

I guess I will have to lay the cables alongside the cable tubes and hose
clamp them on. Has anybody had any luck with this? or have any ideas for
removing the cables?
