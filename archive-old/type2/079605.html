Subject: hot starters

--part1_11e.5611538.28ee2382_boundary

Just noticing a post from yesterday and there's something we need to remember 
about hot starters.  When you crank the engine for a while not only is the 
starter getting hot but the cable from the battery is too.  As copper heats 
up the resistance of the cable increases greatly.  Especially when you've got 
20 year old wiring.  I was having this problem of not turning over on warm 
days as well.  Replaced the original cable with a nice 4ga steel jacketed 
(the kind they use on ships).  Never heard a starter turn over so fast in my 
life.

Hope this is helpful for you warm weather folks.
