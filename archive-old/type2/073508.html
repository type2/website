Subject: Re: 1969 Westy Turn Indicator Problem

Thanks Joe, I'll check it out.

And thanks to everyone else who p-mailed me, as well. The consensus seems
to be a relay problem with check the connections and the grounds thrown in
for spice.

Thanks again,

&gt;Bob, it's scaring me that I know this, but you have a wire loose in your

&gt;worked it's way loose and you're repositioning it with the gyrations
&gt;you've described. Of course, once you remove the cover, you must be
&gt;comitted to resolder it in place, since it will move even more and
&gt;possibly ground on the cover...and your &quot;normal&quot; ritual will no longer
&gt;work.
