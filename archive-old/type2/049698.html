List,

That rally bug is very cool.
Driving 4 wheels with 270-300hp isn't a problem.

An 80hp T4 might be asking a lot. I'd imagine
after the
required power for a home made syncro you'd top
out at 45mph.

Don't get me wrong... I love syncros and 4X4's and
hope to have
one, preferably from the factory some day if they
ever get around to it.

If you want traction... get a set of Snow Tires.
Here in northern IL we just
got 12+ inches of snow. I'm currently riding a set
of Dunlop SP Winter.

They are $40 each, lotsa grip, with weight over
the driving wheels...

What could be better?

Should be similar. What the design I saw relied on
was the horizontal pinion shaft that runs from the
gear clusters out back to the ring and pinion. The
automatic should have the same shaft and as long
as nothing was in the way - I think it would work
if you were a very good machinist and could
fabricate the necessary parts.

Look for a cutaway shot of the internals of an
automatic and then one of the manual tranny. I
think Bentley has the proper illustrations.

Can this gear be found on an automatic

All you do is build a modified front housing for a
VW transmission that
handles an output shaft bearing next to the shift
rod. You extend the
pinion shaft out of the front of the tranny right
through this new bearing.

It's been done and there is a web page somewhere
with detailed pictures.

The next challenge is to create a front
differential with a matching gear
ratio - maybe existing pinion shaft and
differential out of a matching
transmission?

It would take a long driveshaft with a carrier
bearing too like my CR-V has.

Might want to add a viscous coupler to minimize
binding in turns.

Been thinking about this for a long time...
