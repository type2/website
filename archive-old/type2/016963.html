&gt; &gt; The &quot;engine-in-a-box&quot; that came with the '72 had a decent pair of
&gt; &gt; heat exchangers. I understand that these will bolt right up to
&gt; &gt; the '77, but that I'd need to use the earlier exhaust with these.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone out there know why this might be a bad idea? Has
&gt; &gt; anyone done this (fitted early heat exchangers and exhaust to late bay)?
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, it's a very good idea.  Original style '72-74 exhaust systems are
&gt; relatively inexpensive and of very high quality.  Original style '76-78
&gt; systems, on the other hand, are no longer available, forcing you to buy an
&gt; aftermarket system of inferior quality.  Anyone replacing heat exhangers and
&gt; exhaust on a '75-78 bus would be well advised to replace them with the
&gt; earlier style, just because of the exhaust system options it opens up.

Joe, Ron:
I agree 100%, though there are a couple more parts that need changing:
4 pieces of lower engine sheetmetal, the alternator adjustment bracket,
and the left side muffler hanger. If you've got both engines in the same
location, this should seem pretty obvious because the 75-78 exhaust
takes a move forward first, then does a 180 to the exchanger, while the
72-74 (and 79-though the head flanges are different) doesn't have any of
this foolishness. Therefore, there is much less pipe to cover up with
tin.
