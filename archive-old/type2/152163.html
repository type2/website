&gt; Had my wife pick me up and take me to Pep Boys (nearest place) and got some
&gt; 3/16&quot; (4.8mm) fuel line and some clamps. I go back and hook it all up, looks
&gt; good. Get in the bus and start it... GAS POURING OUT OF THE PUMP!
&gt;
&gt; Needless to say, I ran back to the drivers seat and hit the ignition. I went
&gt; under and double and triple checked the hoses while gas was still pouring
&gt; out of the pump (until I got the clamps on... I'm smelling wonderful
&gt; now...). So it's not the hoses.


while you have it torn apart put a small ball valve stop cock in the lines
that way any time you have to change the filter or work on the pump
whatever you can turn off the fuel, makes it easier when taking the engine
out (FI engines need two valves)
