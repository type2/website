Subject: Re&gt; Any auto gurus?

Well I'm no guru, but I have done the procedure you're discussing.

The torque converter has a shaft that goes through the torque converter 
seal. An auto transmission shop guy told me that sometimes the outside of 
this shaft will get scored after long use. If you have such scoring on 
the shaft AND the torque converter seal is positioned so that the tight 
part contacting the shaft is right on the scoring that might produce a 
leak. 

It was my experience that the tc seal could be installed just flush or up 
to maybe a few millimeters further in. The shaft on the torque converter is 
about 1cm or so (maybe a bit more?) long. SO there's some room to play 
with there in terms of having the seal further in or further out. 

My torque converter seal could NOT simply be pushed into place with 
fingers. I had to tap carefully around and around with my rubber mallet 
to seat it. The manual recommends installing with a special tool which I 
imagine is some sort of disk with a screw to tighten the whole thing in. 
If yours could push right in, maybe it's not tight enough to make a good 
seal around the outside edge (where the seal meets the tranny/ 
differential bell housing). Maybe a different seal, or an appropriate 
seating/ gasket compound would help.

What a drag! Engine out and all the way back in just to test it and see 
if it's working! Big big hassle.

Since you can see where the fluid's coming from, there's little doubt as 
to the problem. But since the engine motion slings ATF all over the 
place, you probably can't tell by looking at the parts just how the leak 
is occurring. But it must be the torque converter seal. What else is there?

Um, what else? Possible problem with excessive endplay in the engine, or 
something awful like a broken (but reasonably well mated) crankshaft 
might add enough wobble and vibration from the engine side of that 
linkage to make something leak. Or poorly tightened bolts holding torque 
converter to engine plate? Or problem with transmission imparting some 
improper thrust, wobble or vibration to the shafts the torque converter 
engages with on the tranny side?

This time round, I'd recommend showing all the parts to a good auto 
tranny shop that does VW trannies before I reassemble the whole shebang. 

I suppose you might take it apart and see someting really obvious, like 
the tc seal has been pushed back and out by fluid pressure. Then again, 
you might not. That thing should fit tightly against the bell housing 
though, that's for sure. Could it be in backwards?

Just grasping at straws now. 

Good luck! Persevere!
