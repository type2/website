&gt;&gt;Ya think I need a new starter?? Or just keep a
&gt;&gt;hammer in the bus?

&gt;Dilligad had this problem...I ran a heavy gauge wire from the positive side
&gt;of the starter into the engine bay to bypass the ignition switch.
&gt;Make sure to tape the exposed end of the wire while not in use.
&gt;TO START:
&gt;First, chock your tires as you will be leaving the tranny in neutral.
&gt;Second, LEAVE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL   (amhik)
&gt;Third, turn key to 'on' position.
&gt;Fourth, go to engine bay, untape the wire, and with one hand on the
&gt;throttle, (you sure it's in neutral?)touch the wire to the positive (+)
&gt;terminal on your battery.(yes it's LOUD...and there will be sparks)

Hey, you should run the wire up to a push button on the dash.  Much
easier...
