Subject: Need a dipstick

Anyone out there have a spare dipstick for a 72 bus?
I'm using the one out of my 912 for now because the one for the 914 is way
too long.
let me know,


Thanks!

&gt; The oil light on my 82 Westy stays on for a bit after start up.
&gt; If I give it
&gt; a slight rev it goes out.  I keep checking the dip stick and it says the
&gt; engine oil is full.  Is this normal?
