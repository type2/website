I haven't seen any discussion about CYW in Sevierville, Tenn. which is this
weekend. Camping will be Friday and Sat. nite. Although the weather here has
taken a sudden wet and cold turn, and they are calling for some rain for the
weekend, this is always a great VW, camping, family, fun event.

Erml Washam and his AVWA clan host a really fun event. The outlet shopping in
Pigeon Forge is very close by with bargains to keep the wives happy, and there
is a big asphalt oval for kids to ride their bikes around at the show.

I left my flyer at home with the event costs, but they are very reasonable. I
assumed someone would already have posted them by now. All the exciting
details about the event is at the club web address: www.avwa_dot_com. 

If you can go, it's a great show!  (You can probably tell I'm fired up about
the event--this is the 1st VW camping show for me to try out the sleeping
accomodations in my 75 Westy.)
