&gt;To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 1970 Westfalia with the BN4 gas heater in the 
engine compartment.  I need to replace the gasoline 
resistant &quot;quad ring&quot; in the top of the old style aluminium 
fuel filter because it is leaking.  The question is where do 
I find this part?  I have called some local auto parts 
places around Vancouver, BC and they haven't even heard of 
such a thing.  Has anyone found one and where?  Perhaps it 
has another application that it is used for.  Thanks for the 
help.
&gt;
&gt;Paul
