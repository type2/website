Subject: 1968 westy needs a home

I have a 1968 Westy walkthrough with unsigned title, but no engine, in my 
garage that is free to a good home.  I pulled it from Nebraska.  It has 
everything but the sink.  It never ran, but can be towed.  I live in 
Levenworth, Kansas.  Good metal on all around except for the bottom panels 
which have the panels riveted in place.  All glass with front seats and the 
fold down back seat.  Sorry, no cot.  Wife says give it away or salvage it, 
either way she goes.
