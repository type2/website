I believe you are correct, upon reviewing the dizzy specs on OldVolks =
Home it does appear I should be setting it at 0 with vac disconnected.  =
I have a dizzy from a 70 manual (113 905 205T) on an unknown dual port =
engine.  I'll have to recheck, but I thought I culled the 7.5 ATDC from =
the chart in Bentley.  If someone has it available I'd be curious what =
it says.  My understanding though is that there is not a lot of =
essential correlation between the carb and the dizzy and that the =
distributor changes (especially the dual vac dizzy) were made to meet =
emissions guidelines.=20

I need a little more info here. Nowhere do you say what year/engine you =
have.
Where are you getting specs of 7.5 AFTER from?!?
What dizzy do you have?
What book are you using?
