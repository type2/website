Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator with 34 pict 3

Arlo Guthrie fan John asks:

&gt;The accelerator pump
&gt;does not clear the alternator body.  I thought there
&gt;was an adaptor you could buy that raised the carb a
&gt;little higher to nake the clearance, but I couldn't
&gt;find it online anywhere.  So I browsed the T2 archives
&gt;and found that some have grinded the body of the
&gt;alernator to get the clearance.  Can I really do
&gt;this???? OR better yet, can someone point in the right
&gt;direction to find the carb spacer??

	I just bought one of those carbs and hope to slap it onto my 
1600 DP, so I'd be glad to learn how this project goes.
	Carb/barrel spacers, ca.1cm thick, occur on many motorcycles 
this past couple decades; a wrecker (US 'parter'?) who saves these 
might let you look thru his collection  ...  They insulate the carb 
thermally and vibrationally from air-cooled cylinders hotter than 
ours.  Different thicknesses won't make the sort of difference that 
John Britten might have cared about in intake-tract tuning at which 
he may have been Munro's rival but similarly died with secrets 
unrevealed ;-)
	Also you can drill such a 'thick gasket' and glue in a big 
(blood donor) stainless needle so its point is in the middle of the 
mixture flow, for water-injection  -  make sure the bottle is a few 
cm, at least, lower altitude.

	An 'end run' is to get the under-rated Brazilian Weber which 
is so good I'm in no great hurry to swap it for the 34 PICT.  Mark 
Dearing has a shelf of these classified 'worn out' so if you're good 
at carb reconditioning  ...


cheers
