Matt,
   Try haven someone get up there and push down on the back of the sunroof
kinda like they are given CPR as you gently try to crank it back. You cant really trouble
shoot the sun roof  mechanism very well without getting it retracted at least 6 inchs or so.
But it sounds to me like it just stuck... the above procedure was how I broke loose my
74's sunroof when I first bought it... looks like I will have to do it again as I tried to open
it on our sunny day last week and it wouldnt open &lt;sigh&gt;.


O.K.,  its gettin warm out, and i really want to be able to open the sunroof 
in my 79 Bus. When i got it in the fall, the roof dropped a little bit when i 
turned the crank, but wouldnt open up or seal shut. After a few good rains i 
was convinced it was worth it to caulk up for the winter.
