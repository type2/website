Subject: RE: [T2] Another seatbelt question

Zach,

If the holes have never been used, they may have plugs in them that are
painted the same color as the interior of the van.

&gt; A while back you may remember I asked about seatbelts in a westy. I was
&gt; sure I had seen the mounting bolts in there. Well, yesterday as I was
&gt; working I thought I'd give it a looksie. I don't see any mounting bolts
&gt; or holes or anything.
