Subject: FYI - IRC chat server

Volks, 

Just for your information, among the services we run on the type2 server
is an IRC chat host.  People drop in htere byu times just to meet other
list members in an informal, anything-(almost)-goes atmosphere.

To get there, download and install mirc (for Wintel) or Ircle (for mac)
and point it at:
irc.type2_dot_com
we are usually in 
#buslist.

To get mirc or ircle, go to www.tucows_dot_com and do a search on the name.
