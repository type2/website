yup, its great, i've learned alot from the list. and infact if i do ever
need a rebuild, i'll probably eather build it my self (probably blow it
up in the process, but its a learning experence) or buy apv because
there so highly recamended. i also know to avoid GEX, things like that.
the information is wondefull.
