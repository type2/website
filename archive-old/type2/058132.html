Subject: rim strength question (&amp;JEROME)

Why put good heavy duty tires on weak rims, right?

Just wondering, I picked up a set of fake Porsche alloys, considering
putting good tires n them and running them on one of the buses, however,
are the rims weak crap?  Can they bear a frequently heavily loaded bus.  My
high speed mountain driving would hurt them would it?
