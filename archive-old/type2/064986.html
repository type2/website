Subject: ACS&amp;R Plea (Sad Story)

As I stopped by the data center at the main offices this evening I was 
greeted by &quot;The Friendliest Security Guard in the Midwest&quot;.  He keeps his 
eyes open for VWs and old Schwinns for me and I find him old MGs.  A good 
relationship.  Tonite he says he has some news for me, but I probably 
don't want to hear it.  He says that he found a '63 Double Cab Pickup in 
a little town south of here on Friday, but the muffler shop it was in 
front of was closed.  When he returned to ask about it on Monday morning 
it was gone.  He asked the owner what happened to the truck and was told 
that it had been for sale for $300 for over three months.  Since no one 
even asked about it, he sent it to the crusher over the weekend. :(  The 
FSGITMW said that it was not really visible from the road.  No wonder no 
one inquired about it.

If you know of any old Busses out there and you are waiting for the bucks 
or an opportune moment, or whatever... don't wait any longer!  Sh_t or 
get off the pot!  Who knows what evil lurks in the mind of said Bus 
owners?  The siren song of the scrap metal yards is always in the air.

Save them all ...
