Hi,

&gt; &gt;Those of us w/older t2s have to deal w/them being under powered....Were the vw designers of the 60's and 70's insane when they put 
&gt; such small engines in such big vehicles

 '70s t2s are only underpowered in comparison to modern vehicles (at least in Europe). In fact, if  I recall correctly the VW van had pretty good performance in comparison to other delivery vans of the period. The handling and road manners were certainly better than its contemporaries.
 Remember that driving conditions are different in Europe. Even if there were suitable roads (like the autobahns) it wouldn't be normal to drive a van at high speed and European vehicles are generally less powerful than American ones
 anyway (so hillclimbing and lanechanging are done differently).
 Vehicles being smaller here, the VW van is regarded as a &quot;full sized&quot; delivery van, not as a &quot;station wagon&quot;. It is a clear step up in size from  traditional large estate cars like Volvos and Mercedes. The rise in the popularity of &quot;people carriers&quot; like the Renault Espace, VW Sharan etc. has blurred the boundary somewhat but VW Transporters are sold as commercial vehicles (vans and minibuses) rather than large cars. A VW car dealership (as opposed to a commercial vehicle dealership) wouldn't carry Transporters but would pitch the Sharan as a large car (even though they've been advertised with comparisons to splitwindow campers). To buy a T4 you go to a van dealership.

Cheers,
               W.
