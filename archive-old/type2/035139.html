Hi Amy...

Dave's suggestions are quite good.  The only thing I would add, related to
the preheat, is the fact that you might be experiencing some carb icing.
Next time it's cold and you start your bus, check out the intake manifold
(the steel piping that the carb is mounted on that runs to the block) and
see if you're developing a frost right underneath your carb(s?).    This is
more common as it gets colder and I have been experiencing this recently
here in Seattle as it's been a bit cooler over the past month.  The frost
usually forms a couple of minutes after the engine has been running and will
cause it to run terribly.  It eventually melts off as the engine and air
warms up, but can be miserable until then.  Start 5 minutes early and have a
look next time you run your bus in the cold.

Hope this helps.

We just got a lot of snow here in IL and its very cold.  This morning I
started my bus and it was running fine for about 5 min. while I let it warm
up, and then when I got in it just died.  It started back up, but if I
didn't
give it a lot of gas on my way to school it would die.  Is it just because
its sooo cold, or do you think its more than just the cold thats my problem?
Thanks.
