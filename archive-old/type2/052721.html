&gt; As Ken and others have now threatened me, I give up.  The bullies have won.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you publicly for all the hard,
and mostly thankless, work you have done over the past few years.

I have as they say &quot;been there, done that&quot; those of us satisfied with the

so let me say, &quot;Atta boy, a job well done&quot;
THANKS

Bob
