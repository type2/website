That AFM is '78-'79 Bus, according to the list in the type2_dot_com library.  
Unfortunately, that list only has Bosch numbers for reman ECU's, and I 
didn't find anything else online .. and all my books are at the shop.

Based on the &quot;P&quot; suffix, I'd *guess* it's correct a late engine, which would
fit with the '78-'79 dating for the AFM.  But unlike D-jetronic, L-jet doesn't 
care about the dizzy; all it wants is a signal.  I'd leave the other one in if
it's known-good, at least until everything is working
