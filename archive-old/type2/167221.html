Subject: New Mexico Travel Questions, can I rent a bus?

The route suggested is an excellent one - lots of little stops.

However, IIRC: New Mexico highways + August = really freaking hot.

I'd rent the w/c'd eurovan (or any WC VW) unless you're planning on NOT 
making many little stops during the day.
