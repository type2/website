Subject: more battery relay questions and fridge..

Due to the recent questions about relays and such I have one of
my own to add:
Bus : 74 Deluxe Westie. Has the fridge which only has a coldness dial
and a 12volt / shore power switch.

The extra battery is under the rear seat.  It powers the fridge well
enough I believe but I am not sure how it recharges. Are they supposed
to automatically charge with shore power connected? Or do they
have a relay installed which charges the battery while driving?

Reason I ask is that the battery seems to be constantly drained. Even
when driving around.  I wasn't sure if it should recharge when I have it
plugged in.  I have an extra relay I could pop in to charge the battery
while it's driving but could it harm anything if it so happens that there
are two relays going at the same time?

I couldn't find any info in the archives that told me definitely...

Thanks

James
