Subject: Cooling fan clattering

My 71 Westy has a 72 Super Beetle engine in it, and it has been of great
service so far. Unfortunately, I feel that there is a degenerative disease in
the works.....
I noticed a slight squealing from the fan housing a couple of months ago. It
was intermittent, in that it didn't do it all the time. I reached around to
the fan (*engine off!!*) and found no crap there. The squealing went away.
Now I have a definite clattering that is heard even from the air scoops!! So
here's the question ---
Do I have to drop the engine to diagnose/replace the cooling fan, or is there
some shortcut that I don't know? I remember pulling the whole engine in the
Super Beetle to get that cooling fan out.
Any suggestions on diagnosis or otherwise will be appreciated!!
