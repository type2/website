&lt;In fact doesn't really charge up until hit about 1500 rpm.&gt;

Exactly. A car with a/c and other extras would have trouble in idling traffic after just a short time. Same reason cars are now scheduled to go to 42 volts in the coming years. 

Alternators charge quite a bit (I have heard almost full capacity) at near idle speeds. At idle speeds they certainly make alot of usable power...
