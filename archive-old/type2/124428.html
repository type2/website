Subject: 1979 Westy donor to '79 Kombi sunroof

Hi, all. Long time listee returning from lurking (yesss, my preciousssss, I
have been watching).

I'm looking for opinions (looking really hard) about migrating a Westy to a
Kombi body. The Kombi is all original (special order, two three-passenger
benches and the big sunroof, grey interior panels and no headliner over the
passenger compartment with the exception of the sunroof). It differs from
the Westy in the following ways (besides the Westy additions):
Siding sunroof  (sunroof panel and associated hardaware)
Front seats don't swivel. Full panels exist behind front seats
Slide-open windows amidships (rather than the jalousie type)
Two rear bench seats

My first impulse is to install the aft cabinets (over the rear cargo area),
the closet and refreigator and hanging locker, and fold-down rear seat,
leaving space foreward to bolt in an additional front seat from the Kombi.
I'll definitely add the jalousie windows. They rattle a ittle bit in the
wind, but I love leaving them sightly open while parked. I store my wine in
my Westy because it maintains a such constant temperature.

How often do you who have the sink/propane stove use them? Would you rather
cook outside? Do you have the original propane tank filled? In California?

The top of the Kombi is dented in many areas (looks like a bad drive-thru
incident, or a lot of little kids climbing thru the sunroof and out onto the
roof and dancing Scottish jigs, with many, many pigs). I'd love to keep the
sunroof and forego the pop-top (my last Westy, a '72 hardop, seemed to work
out pretty well), but it'd save me a bundle on bodywork if I covered it all
up with the Fiberglas, which is in great shape with new canvas.
Do you use the pop-top? Is it worth the extra top-heaviness when used around
town as a daiy driver? I believe the sunroof model has the same roof opening
as the Westy. Can you conform this? Any tips on moving the pop-top over?

Number one of many future postings. Love you all!
Thanks for your responses. P-mail me if you wish at airhedz_at_earthlink_dot_net
