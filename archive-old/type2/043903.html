save your time and money, send the engine back and save yourself the
headache.   especially if it is a 2liter engine.
 
&gt; Does anyone have a recommendation on how to THOROUGHLY clean out an oil 
&gt; cooler?  Like, a good method of cleaning out the core?  What type solvent 
&gt; can I put through the cooler to make sure I'm getting everything out?  How 
&gt; do I know I AM getting everything out?

they just use that as an excuse not to back up their joke of a warranty

&gt; Also, are there any &quot;must replace&quot; type things I should do now, w/the motor 
&gt; out &amp; save some time/sweat later?

the engine!

sorry to be such a spoil sport but I wish someone would have warned me
before I let myself get screwed by them.  read the archives or my lawsuit
against them, at District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City civil case
No 0101-0025512-98  (BTW, I won)

you have been warned
