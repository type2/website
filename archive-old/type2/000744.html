 BugFest Northwest is next weekend 10 AM to 4 PM May 23rd at Mason County
 Fairgrounds in Shelton, WA.  A cruise-in, cruise and parade are planned for
 Saturday May 22 1 to 5.  Camping and RV sites are available at $8 &amp; $12
 respectively.  Join us for this start of the season event.

 This BugFest is not a show in the traditional sense.  It is more like a
 convention of V-Dubbers where we can all park our cars together, network,
 share ideas, attend clinics and pick up hard to find parts and accessories.
 It is also an old fashioned 4th of July family event with food, games,
 prizes, valve cover races and supervised children's activities.  The whole
 family is included in the price of registration.  Last year participants
 came from as far as Central California and Canada.

 The Caravan for Eugene, Springfield, Corvallis and Albany areas will meet
 with Darren &amp; Heidi Stehle at McDonalds in Albany (3232 Pacific Blvd) next
 to I-5 exit 8:00 am on Saturday, May 22nd.

  The Portland Caravan will meet at 9 AM with Shad Crichton at Toys-R-Us in
 the Janzen Beach Parking lot off the last I-5 exit in Oregon.
