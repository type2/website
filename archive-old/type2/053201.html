Subject: US VW Shows &amp; Events page

Hi everyone,

I updated the VW Shows &amp; Events Page at http://members.aol_dot_com/vwshows
tonight.  Please visit it to check out what to do for your weekends this
summer!  If you don't see an event listed that you would like me to add,
please email me at paulcwilliamson_at_yahoo_dot_com to get it on the list!  If
there's another list this should go to, please forward it on or let me know
and I'll add it to the lists I mail to now.  If you have suggestions on how
to change it, please tell me that as well.

Paul
