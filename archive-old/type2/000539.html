Hi,

Your the second person to tell me about the brake lines.  The only flexible
brake lines, unless I missed something are the fronts.  Is this correct.
When I did the brake job on this bus I also replaced the backing plates
because the previous owner I am thinking just simply put the adjusting tool
in and finally longated the adjusting holes to a point that I could do
anything else but replace them. Again I don't think there is any flexible
lines on the rear. Since you represent a vendor, whats the price on the
fronts.  Also what is your opinion about replacing the 1 inch vacuum lines
and do you carry those also.  Thanks for all your help.

Bill
