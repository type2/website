How is everybody?

I've been reconfiguring my rebuilt 2 liter engine (again) and its
almost ready.  I reinstalled everything with a CB Performance torque
cam and lifters and now I need a new oil pump.  I think I've read here
on the list that I can use a type 1 oil pump.  Any body have experience
with this swap?  I'd like to use a heavy duty oil pump with an aluminum
body.  Any body know of a good brand to go with?  TIA for any advise /
opinions on this.
