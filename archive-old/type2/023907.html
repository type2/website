&gt; I was telling my dad about Subaru egine swap he sugested a 
&gt; Mazda Rotary
&gt; Engine these engines are incredibly small(overall) and extremely
&gt; efficiant, about 1.3L and  135hp('84-'85), for a little more 
&gt; get up and
&gt; go there were actually some turbocharged rotaries 165hp('87) and later
&gt; 182hp('89) and 200hp('90)

Hi,

My first thought here is to not bother with a rotary swap for a Bus, the
rotary is a very peaky motor in that it needs a lot of revs to produce the
sort of power your talking about.  For a Bus you really need an engine with
torque down low rather than HP up high like the rotary.  A turbo may solve
this problem but then you'd probably need intercoolers and the like to
produce the HP figures you're talking about, rotarys chuck out a lot of
heat. 

As for efficient, from my experience with rotary's they may produce a lot of
power for their size but they use a heap of fuel doing it, they must be one
of the least efficient engines around.  I think this is why they're only
available from Mazda and only in the top of the line cars/sports models.

Hmmm, if there is a rotary powered bus out there I'd love to be proved wrong
and add it too my Wild VW site ;)

Cheers
Steve
