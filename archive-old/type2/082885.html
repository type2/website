&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt;
&gt; The dude at the parts shop I go to tried to sell me an electronic ignition
&gt; replacement module instead of putting in new points and condenser. He says
&gt; he runs one in his bus, and rarely has trouble with it. Does anybody have
&gt; any info or experience with these devices?

Gee, I run a points and condensor on my bus and I also &quot;seldom have
trouble with it&quot;.

Unless you have a really good reason to switch, I'd stick with the points.
they work well and are easily repaired.
