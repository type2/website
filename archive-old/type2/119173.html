Subject: Ice Storms (Was: &quot;filtering for list mail using omnipresent
  [T2]&quot;)

From: &lt;benthin_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Relating to the compaint of wrong clocks putting mail at the bottom: to
please both the complainers (R.A. et al) and listee (J.T.) dealing with
date-sensitive software-

I was rather confused by Richard's complaint.  I've never had a problem with
J's mail, but then I also filter T2 List mail into it's own folder.

Bus Content:

Our bus came through the ice storms down here in Georgia okay.  Any sad
stories out there?
