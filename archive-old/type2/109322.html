Subject: Part number match/ compatabilty

Regarding my previous thread on my bad decel valve. The Bosch part number on
my valve is 0 280 160 303. VW number is 022 133 551 B. I was able to find one
in a local salvage yard in a '75 bus. The Bosch number on it is
0 280 160 300 with VW number 022 133 551 A. Now, will the valve I got from the
'75 replace the one in my '78 without any consequence. When I did a part
search on the Bosch site, it lists the 303 for 75-78. I am wondering if there
is any vacuum pressure difference from the early FI to the later that would
not allow me to use the 300 on my bus.

Thanks
