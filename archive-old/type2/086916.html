&gt; Chuck,
&gt; I see all this stuff on side mounted tents, and I keep thinking.........
&gt; Once the tent is set up, you are stuck to it.
&gt; 
&gt; A separate tent allows you to stash your stuff in a bit more security than 
&gt; just setting things outside on the picnic table, and you can drive away and 
&gt; return later.

my old 65 Westy had a zipper between the tent and the bus.  of course
getting lined up when one got back was a real trick but surprisingly easy
once one got used to it.

this was a stock set up on that year I suspect since the whole van was
stock to the bone when I bought it in 72

&gt; Original side tents have charisma and look kewel.
&gt; Beyond that, I can't find a reason to have something else to worry about as 
&gt; to fragility, care, proper storage, preparation for storage, etc.

well the one I had was more a &quot;sun room&quot; than an actual tent but it was
pretty sturdy and tough, sorry I didn't keep it when I sold the van...
