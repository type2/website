Subject: Mechanical Fuel Pump rebuild kits?

Hello,

I have a 1700 in my 72 van it currently uses an electric pump because the 
mechanical pump is dead. Everyone I call says the rebuild kits have been 
discontinued. i would like try to bring my van back to original condition. 
Does anyone know of any outfit that still sells these rebuild kits?


Thanks in advance, Phil.
