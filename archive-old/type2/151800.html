Subject: Re: [T2] break line woes

Dan,

After having similar problems as yours, I found a kit that handles 
different diameter(metric) lines from toolwarehouse_dot_net.

It puts an &quot;iso&quot; bubble &quot;lip&quot; on the end of the line...this is what a lot 
of european cars use(like ours).

Sure can't find it listed easily at their site though(toolwarehouse_dot_net).

The local flaps folks are just going to look at you funny when you try and 
talk to them about reflaring a line.

Cheers, dave

 It's the front one I'm having trouble with.  I can't seem to bend the 12&quot;
 ones I found at NAPA so they're not in the way.  I'm also having trouble
 finding a replacement in the Denver CO metro area.  Should any break
 place be able to cut and re-flare a break line for me?  Is there an
 inexpensive tool that will cut and double flare a line?  I think it's
 about 6&quot; or so is all I need.
