Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coating

$40-$50 per steel wheel is average+.
Cheaper to do if you can sandblast yourself.
More than half the cost is surface prep.
Somebody on the list can get one ( or a whole
dozen :) done for $40, with a slight price increase
for color change mid-job. Search the archives from
this past summer if he doesn't surface soon.

Subject: [T2] Powder Coating


&gt; At a Home and Garden show today, there were a couple of powder coaters
&gt; there pushing their work on lawn furniture and the such.
&gt;
&gt; One guy had a wheel on display.
&gt;
&gt; I asked him the price for a blast and powder coat job on a wheel, and he
&gt; said $50.00.
&gt;
&gt; I then asked about bringing in 12 at a whack, and he said &quot;around&quot; $40
each.
&gt;
&gt; That in the realm of being high, middle range, low, what?
&gt; What have others been paying ?
