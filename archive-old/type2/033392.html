I think you're thinking of Pergo. IKEA sells it, for one.

&lt;&lt; There is a new kind of flooring out these days that would seem to be ideal
 to achieve the effect you are seeking.  It is some sort of laminate on a
 backing board and is ~3/8&quot; thick.  While thicker than the stock finish
 floor, I don't think it would raise as many height issues and it is
 designed to be glued down, so it would fasten to the masonite just fine.
 It is also prefinished and hard so that wear and tear will not be as much
 of a problem (I am still typing because I am having a neuron misfire on
 the name of the damn stuff) I can't remember :-(  I think Formica makes a
 variety of it. &gt;&gt;
