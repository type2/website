&gt;Any remedies on how to cure stuck caliper pistons??

#1 - compressed air in the brake line opening.  put a piece of wood or 
     something else soft to catch the piston as it comes out of the bore 
     so not to mar the piston surfaces

or my favorite

#2 - screw a zerk fitting into the caliper (or wheel cylinder) brake line 
     opening and use a lever arm grease gun to gently force the piston out.

If you use a grease gun, clean the caliper or wheel cylinder completely 
before re-assembly.  I soak them in carb cleaner overnight, rinse, blow 
out with compressed air, do a final rinse with brake cleaner, then blow 
out with compressed air again.  Always replace the o-rings &amp; seals if you 
do this.
