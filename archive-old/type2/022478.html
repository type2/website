Hi Volks,

Funny this thread should come up today . . . maybe this information will 
shed some light.

Yesterday , while I was picking up my '81 Vanagon at my local VW repair 
shop here in Portland, I was talking to one of the owners about 
overheating, low oil pressure, etc., after even relatively short periods of 
highway driving at 60-65 mph. He got very serious, said I should slow down, 
and asked me to post a warning to the list about the subject of overheating 
and engine failure in air-cooled VWs. These comments come from Ed at 
Heckmann-Thiemann, an established VW / Porsche / Audi repair shop here in 
Portland, OR, that I have been dealing with for twenty years. Here's what 
he said:

They are seeing a sudden pronounced rise in the number of air-cooled 
engines that are experiencing heat-related failures. They believe that this 
is directly related to the use of alcohol and other additives in oxygenated 
fuels as a result of changes in the EPA regulations governing the refining, 
mixing and composition of fuels. [EPA Phase II?? Ed did not specify] Ed 
says that they are finding air-cooleds with an rapidly increasing variety 
and frequency of heat-induced problems, including pistons seizing, and they 
attribute it to the excessive heat given off by the burning of these fuels 
at highway speeds, particularly during the hotter summer months. Ed says 
that at speeds above 55 mph in warm weather months, air-cooled engines just 
cannot dissipate the heat generated by burning the new fuels fast enough. 
H-T is so concerned about this trend that they are considering sending a 
letter to all of their customers who own air-cooled vehicles, warning them 
to restrict warm-weather driving speeds to 55 mph.

Ed was speaking particularly about air-cooled Vanagons and later loafs, but 
as we were talking a tow-truck pulled in an older 70's loaf next to us. Ed 
hooked his thumb toward the loaf and said they even see the trend on the 
older air-cooled engines. Ed says that the engineering behind these engines 
presumed some things about the nature of the fuels that would be used, and 
those assumptions no longer hold true in the era of reformulated gasoline.

Interestingly, Ed told me that back in the gasoline rationing era of the 
early seventies, when the speed limit on highways was first dropped to 55 
mph, H-T's engine rebuilding workload PLUMMETED to an all-time low. He says 
the reduced speeds were the best thing that ever happened to air-cooled VWs.

I did a little checking and found that the EPA Phase II Reformulated 
Gasoline requirements went into effect January 1, 2000. Although they are 
apparently mandated only in smog-laden metropolitan areas like L.A., many 
states and regional authorities have been adopting EPA standards for their 
areas, or modifying them for local use. Information about the EPA 
regulations is available at http://www.epa_dot_gov/oms/rfg.htm.

Bottom line: if you live in an area that requires the use of reformulated 
gasoline, a life-long VW mechanic would like to encourage you to slow down 
during the hotter months for the sake of your air-cooled engine.

&gt;You seem to loose oil pressure, maybe?? I had the same thing happen to my 
&gt;1982 Vanagon. It would start clicking/loosing power at higher speeds. It 
&gt;turned out that it needed a head job!! On both heads!! While the heads are 
&gt;off the car, you can also check the pistons for wear. That whole adventure 
&gt;cost me a healthy $1.800US.

&gt;Hello,
&gt;got an issue today I can't figure out nor my mechanic.
&gt;on highway travel my engine heats up and then the valves start to click,
&gt;power is lost a little-not  to much. Eric says my engine sounds like it
&gt;is eating itself. I'm going ove rto the shop today to change the oil
&gt;start to weld a custom exhust and figure out this over heating thing.
&gt;any help would be so great. Thanx ya'll
