Subject: Re: [T2] Question about parking lights

Speculate that when parked with the light switch pulled just to the park 
lights position, only the small bulb will be on as the traditional European 
laws require for street parking at night. Less draw with only 4 small 
filaments in that mode.

&gt;
&gt;It appears that the small light works in unison with the weaker(for lack 
&gt;of a better term) filament on the 1157.  That is, they both go on when the 
&gt;parking lights are on and both go off when the parking lights are 
&gt;off.  The blinker of course only affects the stronger filament of the 1157.
&gt;
&gt;I guess my question is this:  Why is the small bulb even there?  It seems 
&gt;to never be on by itself and therefore redundant.  Someone please tell me, 
&gt;I'm dying of curiosity!
