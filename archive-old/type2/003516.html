Yesterday I gave a jump to a stranded motorist and while connecting the
wires I touched metal hearing a spark, what did I fry? And what's the best
place to get it from?

What glue do you guys use for replacing a headliner?

Does anyone have a source for an inexpensive tow hitch/bar?

Thanks, Alex in New Jersey
