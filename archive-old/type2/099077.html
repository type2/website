Subject: Which bus?

I've owned a '72 and a '79.  Much as I love Sally, the '72, it's not her
I'm driving.

The interior is a big improvement on the 79.  I love the convenience of
the electric sink pump and the propane.  The later busses have a real
bed on top, not just the fold down &quot;punishment cot&quot;.  There's nothing
obstructing the slider so loading larger cargo is easier.  With
hydraulic lifters you don't have to wrench every 3k.  I have air
conditioning, which I rarely use, but it makes me feel very affluent. 
Fuel injection beats the heck outa dual carbs.

Downside:

Why is there only 1 window in the front of the canvas on the '79?  Maybe
mine's been replaced, it's in great shape, but I miss the side windows,
much beter ventilation.  

With the air stuff mounted under the dash, any work in there becomes a
nightmare.  It's a two person job to reinstall the instrument panel
should you have to remove it.  It helps if one of the people is really
long and skinny.  The panels is held on with free clips that fall off
and need to be retrieved upon removal, then held in place upon install. 
Grr.  I considered trying to jbweld 'em or something, but when you can't
see whatthell...

The most important thing is that the bus have been reverently treated. 
I'm the 2nd owner of the '72, and not sure how many folx the 79 has had,
but they were good about keeping her in shape and not abusing her.  I've
gotten very lucky with both these busses, no major mechanical probs at
all.

Love my busses!

Teri
