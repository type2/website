&gt;    Not a joke at all -- look at any sandrail or dunebuggy. Super hopped
&gt; up (which naturally means hotter running) engines and they definitely
&gt; don't have sealed engine compartments. Also look at VW powered aircraft
&gt; -- no cooling tin at all, or even fans. I also ran a VW powered sawmill
&gt; for many years -- only minimal cooling tin.
&gt; And that, BTW, was like having your car sitting in one spot all day
&gt; long, no airstream from forward movement like you do in a vehicle.

	Maybe not. The sand rail does not have an enclosed engine
compartment. In the van, the 
	fan has to pull the air from the inlets up at the top. If there is
no seal, it is easier to pull warm air
	in from the bottom than pull the cool air down through the inlet
ducts in the body.

	For the saw will the above also applies, and if it is an industrial
version of the motor, then the tin that was
	there was designed to cool the engine on that application.

	When I got my van, the engine seal was bad. My mechanic insisted
that it needed to be replaced &quot;to allow
	for proper cooling&quot;. Before the fix, the dipstick, and fans shroud
etc would be way too hot to touch.
	After the fix, the dipstick is hardly any warmer than the van door
handles, and the fan shroud although
	warm is cool enough to hold my hand on?? Note the dipstick is close
to the fan inlet so it gives some indication 
	the temperature of the air going into the fan inlet???
