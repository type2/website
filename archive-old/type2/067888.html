Sounds like you need the '75 Rabbit solution.
Put a piece of foam rubber under the acceleator pedal.  That Rabbit 
had NO feedback from the pedal, feet muscles cramped.
&lt;Want some ranting about hunkajunks, just ask me about a '75 Rabbit&gt;
You could also add an additional spring return to the existing.

&gt; Duh, some symptoms are the simplest problems: I can fix my idle by 
&gt; reaching down and lifting my accelerator pedal. I knew this was a problem 
&gt; in icy conditions, but summer? Can I tighten the spring or just soak 
&gt; something with WD-40?
