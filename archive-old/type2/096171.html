Subject: Re: [T2] what about a electronic ignition

&gt; I was thinking about replacing my points to an electronic igniter.  Is this

best thing I ever did.

&gt; a good idea and if so what brand should I get?  I've heard that Pertronix
&gt; only has a 30 month warranty and that not all people have had that much
&gt; success with them.  That leaves me a little weary so is this something I
&gt; want to do?  Thanks

I have been running the Pertronix for a couple years now without any
problems (knock knock) 

YMMV
