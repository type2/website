&gt; Today I discovered how much you can forget in a years time. Its been
&gt; about a year since I removed the engine from my 75 bus. I took notes as
&gt; things came apart but unfortunately the notes are nowhere to be found.:
&gt; ( Today was going to be the day to install my new engine. The first
&gt; problem I ran into wa the bearer bar. Forgot to bolt it to the motor
&gt; mounts before installing the exhaust. Found out the hard way that the
&gt; bar can be installed by removing the passenger side heat exchanger and
&gt; raising the engine about a foot off the ground. Problem solved.
&gt; Proceeded to try installing the engine with all the sheet metal on.
&gt; Mistake number 2. After 2 tries I gave up because it was too cold and I
&gt; was too frustrated to do a good job of it. While cleaning up my tools so
&gt; I can find everything next weekend I remembered that when the engine
&gt; came out I had to remove the tin from the rear of the engine. This was
&gt; the only way to get that last 1/4 inch of clearance to get the lower
&gt; engine to trans. studs to clear the holes in the bell housing. Hopefully
&gt; this is the key to getting it back in?
&gt; 
&gt; Kind of bummed that the engine didn't go smoothly, but I'll try again
&gt; next weekend. No Hurry, That's why I call it the Turtlebus. If I remove
&gt; the sheet metal from the rear of the engine, should that give me the
&gt; clearance I need? Should the engine be kept level with the ground or
&gt; does it need to be tilted at all to get it in? Any advice is
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry this is kind of long but I needed to blow off a little steam.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
