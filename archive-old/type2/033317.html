Subject: Rims

While I wait for my AVP Engine I wanted to start on the rims and need for
tires. The rims on my bus are fairly heavy with surface rust, I want to sand
blast them and paint them. I will sand blast them with the old tires on the
rim, However I was wondering in what order should I paint them. Before I get
the new tires so I dont have to worry about over spray ; or will they get
beat up when I take them to get tires? Or should I have the tires mounted to
the clean sandblasted rims, mask the tires, and then paint?
Never done it so don't know, if you do please fill me in, THANKS.
