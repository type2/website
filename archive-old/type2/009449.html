&gt; Is there a significant decrement in braking performance if the brake
booster
&gt; is disabled in a 74 bus? My situation is unusual because my single
cab is a
&gt; 1970 but has a 1974 nose. It has front disc brakes and a brake
booster. The
&gt; brake booster now is connected to my single port intake mainfold. I'm
&gt; considering putting a dual port engine in and am wondering how to
configure
&gt; the brake booster in this situation.  If there is no way to hook up
the
&gt; booster hose can I just block it off?

No sense in that!  All you have to do is plumb the manifold for the
booster.  If you get the manifold center section out of a '71 bus the
connection is there.  I think that late model bugs also had a similar
port.

Even if you have to put the connection in yourself it isn't all that
hard.  Just get a short length of 1/2 OD tubing, fishmouth the end to
conform with the vertical part of the center section (just below the
carb flange), and braze it into place.  Then use a drill a bit smaller
than the ID of the tube to open the hole into the manifold.  This
method yields a good sturdy vacuum port with nothing extending into
the manifold to interfere with flow.
