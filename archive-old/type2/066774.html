Subject: Re: Where would you go in your VW? &lt;a friday question&gt;

Starting from Lake Tahoe head south to LA for a brief visit 
(Disneyland) then head east to the Grand Canyon, north to Idaho, back 
down to Arizona.  Crisscrossing the Rockies along the way.  East 
through New Mexico to Oklahoma to Nashville, south to Florida, north 
to Vermont hang about the NE for awhile.  West to Detroit area, north 
into Canada go around Lake Superior and up into Saskatechewan and 
return to Seattle then south to close loop.  Of course do this 
without mechanical problems in a VW camper with my wife.

DeJaVu, HEY, I already DID this trip, as our honeymoon.  We were in 
LA for the '84 Olympics (the only reason we visited that area). Spent 
4 months travelling, did 20K miles, burned up brakes once by failing 
to downshift, shock mount bolt came loose.  Those were the only 
mechanical problems we had in our '76 Riviera camper, at least until 
we rolled it in Manitoba on black ice.  Thawed it out, put tire back 
on rim, continued.  Insurance company totaled it, loved that bus!

If you EVER get a chance to do a long trip, GO FOR IT.  We thoroughly 
enjoyed our trip.  Spent less than $10 per week for camping.

Another trip would be spent in similar areas, but different, but this 
time with the 3 kids in our '80 Westi, or if I hit the lottery, a 
Synchro Westi.

BTW for RVB, the year+ we spent in Arizona was spent exploring the 
state, we have a map showing our travels, looks like a spider web! 
Did a LOT of travel in AZ our '80 Westi.

I would rather you vote against me than not vote at all.
Get out and VOTE on November 5th (USA folks that is !)

&gt; May I propose a mental break for the mechanically weary:
&gt; 
&gt; Where would you like to be able to drive your favorite VW if given the time,
&gt; health, and a modest budget. Who would you take along and why? What vehicle
&gt; would you take?
