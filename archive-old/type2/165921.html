Dear Ms. Wilson:

I see a couple of options here.  One; I have a 1981 VW Camper that could be
lent to the endevor.  Trouble is I have just started restoring it (it's in
many pieces at the moment) and I expect that process to take at least a
year and a half.  What's worse is that it is a newer model than the concert
goers of my generation would have used to go to Woodstock.   

The second option is that the owner of a local VW shop has a very nicely
restored 1969 VW camper that is his own personal vehicle. It may be
available if you are interested.   It would have been new at the time of
the festival.  However, I'm thinking that you're looking for the older
camper based on the VW Type 2 Microbus, complete with the Peace Sign on the
nose and Make Love, Not War bumper stickers on the back.   This era camper
is as scarce as hens teeth here in Upstate NY, primarily due to rust, but
I'll check with my local VW Club and look around.

Woodstock happened twice in my backyard during my lifetime, and both times
I missed it!

&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; My name is Mariah Wilson, and I am working on the History Channel
&gt; series Our Generation, which takes a look at the people and events that
&gt; helped shape the Baby Boomer generation.  We are currently working on 
&gt;an episode about the Woodstock Festival,
&gt; and are planning to shoot a &quot;road trip&quot; going back to the site of the
&gt; original festival, with our host and one of the performers from the
&gt; original Woodstock. We figured there would be no better car to make the
&gt; trip in than a Volkswagen Camper Van.
