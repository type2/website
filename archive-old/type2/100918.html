&gt; &gt; hhmmmmm I could use a short vacation, wonder what flying out, and
&gt; &gt; trailering it back would cost????
&gt; 
&gt; At .25/mi for the haul vehicle and .25/mi for the trailer (no wheels,
&gt; remember, I'd need a full trailer), plus gas for 2,500 miles...about
&gt; $1,000, which is how the trucking compaies get the fee they charge
&gt; to haul it back for you.
&gt; 
&gt; One other option I have thought of is to drive the '73 out to the west
&gt; coast next June on my biennial &quot;roundabout&quot;, find a body, stop for a week
&gt; and work myself blind doing the swap on the road.  Not the vacation of the
&gt; century, but a definite thought :-)

of course you could take an axle, or rear hubs and use a tow dolly to tow
it home with your vanagon,  take the Southern route and take your time, I
towed one to Dallas a few years back.
