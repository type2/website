&gt; Hi folks
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to get my tin sealed completely. I have found all the seals except
&gt; for the gromet that seals the left hot air hose as it passes through the tin
&gt; to heat exchanger. Number 40 here http://tinyurl_dot_com/meug . Does anyone know
&gt; where I might be able to find this rubber gromet or have an idea of what to
&gt; use instead?

Try the dealer. Really. I have purchased both this grommet and the oblong
one for the other side from the dealer in the pasr 2 years. They are
expensive. But you don't need 8 of them, so paying a bit extra is not so
bad.
