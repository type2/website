Thanks Brian, it was my pleasure.

Oh, and I didn't do it with *absolutely* nothing to gain - I added a few 
percent markup to cover unexpected costs, such as the possibility of 
someone not paying, and postage cost from Beru which was not available when 
I placed the order (ended up being about $40 - ouch!).  I'm not making any 
money but I will likely get to keep a couple of plugs that were left over, 
which I will keep as spares for my own heaters or possibly hock on E-bay 
one day if I lose my job.  :)

&gt;Just wanted to publicly thank David Schwarze for organizing the group order
&gt;of Beru spark/glow plugs for us gas heater people. My two new plugs - at $25
&gt;each - look exactly like the one I spent $80 for!!!  He did this with
&gt;nothing to gain personally. This kind of gesture is what makes this list so
&gt;great. Thanks Dave!
