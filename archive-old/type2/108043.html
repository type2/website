Subject: Re: [T2] what oil

I've gone back to using straight WD-30 for my Type I engine after previously
using Mobil 1 15-50.

I changed after thinking about the engineering of the engine, particularly
the pressure relief valve, which causes thick oil to bypass the oil cooler.

Here it seemed to me VW engineers had designed in the thinning property of
single-weight oil as part of the overall engine design.  Using a multigrade
oil such as Mobil 1 15-50 or Castrol GTX 10-40 that does not appreciably
thin at higher temperature then defeats, in theory at least, the purpose of
the valve and cause the oil and engine to run hotter.

I am curious to see if anyone else has come to this conclusion or has
logicked this to a different conclusion.

John
