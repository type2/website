Hi Doug,

Put the van in 2nd or 4th gear. Follow the shift rod back about 600mm and there you will find the join between the two parts of the shift rod. undo the screw and disconnect the two halfs of the shift rod.
The front section is then easily removedd from the van to replace the bushing.

Good luck

&gt; Is there any way to get the old front shift rod bushing off the shift rod without taking the tranny out??The Bently manual is about as helpful as a rock on this one.
