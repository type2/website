Subject: Air Flow Sensor for a 78 Bus
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

I've been having problems with keeping my 78 Bus running and after
going throught the Library and doing several tests I believe the
problem is the air flow sensor.  Unfortunately there are no junk yards
around that would have such a creature and I don't want to spend over
$300.00 on something I'm guessing at.  So was wondering if someone on
the list would have one I could try to see if that really is the
problem and if it turns out to be then be willing to sell it to me at
a decent price.  I'd pay shipping to me and if I needed to ship it
back I'd do that also.  You can pmail me.  I'm located in Northern
Indiana if anyone is close by or like I said, I'd pay shipping.

Thanks,

Kevin
