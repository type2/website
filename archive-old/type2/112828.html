Subject: Re: [T2] Engine urban legends.........

Actually the procedure is start the motor and loosen the adjuster until 
you hear the clatter. Tighten 'til it stops. Tighten 3/4 additional 
turn. (Small block Chevy hydraulics are the easiest valves in the world 
to adjust. Messy though....)

&gt;If there isn't a problem elsewhere, this should be possible. My father also

&gt;back off a quarter turn. Of course, that pits your piston... But you're doing
&gt;a rebuild every 25K miles, right?
