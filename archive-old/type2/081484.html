Subject: Big clutch nightmare...resolved for now.

Ok the guy at GoWesty confirmed that I would have to switch out the
bellhousing to make my 228mm flywheel fit. He admitted he made a mistake and
was apologetic and said he would do what it takes to make me happy (come and
reinstall my engine :)  )

Anyway he is sending me a free 210mm clutch, cover and assorted to replace
the 228 for free. I will send him back my 228 and flywheel for a full credit
and he will pay the shipping both ways.

In the end I will have to machine my flywheel (expected in an engine swap I
guess), and remove and install the engine a second time.

Thanks for the knowledge on this list. When I called him he stated at first
that the 228 would work just fine, but I told him everyone on the list said
it wouldn't fit. He then talked to someone else after I said that and
realized he made a mistake. This list does carry a lot of weight. He was
very nice and apologetic. I have a hard time faulting him for it, but I sure
do miss driving my bus as its my daily driver. I would like a cigar, but I
can't get to the store!!!
