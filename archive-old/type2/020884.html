I'm late on this thread, but when I had missing, the first thing checked
was to put a strobe light on each plug wire and test for firing in each
cylinder under different rpm's- you can do the same by watching the
spark gap jump. Yes you could put the strobe on the center coil wire
also.   Missing due to a bad wire was obvious this way, for if you see
missing with all the plugs, it's likely to be something under the distr.
cap.
&gt; I had this same problem and the last component I changed before it went away
&gt; forever
&gt; was the rotor.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,
&gt; Christopher
