Subject: Re: [T2] Deep sump systems?

Chris,

Deep sump doesn't really help much on heat....just takes longer for the 
oil to get warmer.

These are really about people with hi perf engines that can run all the 
oil out of the sump before it has time to flow back down from the heads 
and such....especially folks to hard curves at hi rpm's.

This is the deep sump systems like for a T1 engine...you didn't state your 
year.  :-((

I am not *aware* of anyone making one for T4 engines.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Does anyone have experience running a deep sump system on their bus? I have 
&gt; been considering it as part of my move to Florida to help handle the heat. 
&gt; singe quiet pack muffler, and it hangs down a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Just looking for people with experience. The engine doesn't overheat now 
&gt; and I am also going to richen the mixture a bit to make it run cooler in 
&gt; the summer.
