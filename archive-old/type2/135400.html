&gt; If you have a GEX and have gone 15k miles you might as well leave it

But at $400 for new heads, you are 1/3 of the way to a new engine. The 
GEX will fail you, that's certain. Get rid of it. Start fresh.

GEX makes its money by building engines from parts that just satisfy 
specs. There's no latitude for wear. Driving a GEX engine is like 
walking on your fingers. Sure, you can do it. But why would you want to 
when you have feet?
