Subject: Re: [T2] New VW bus

Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

I think if they would just put round headlamps into the Bus, it would be
better looking vehicle, but I still want one.

I saw this Bus along with the pickup truck concept at the Chicago auto
show two years ago, and they are really pretty neat.

The interior is gorgeous, and the rear end treatment is really nice.

I say--wait and see what is the final product--this is only a concept
vehicle.


Later,


Terry

it really does look like rosie from the jetsons. it appears to be
designed by children upon leaving the terminator2 exhibit at the movie
theme park. retractable door handles? dvd games? does the westfalia come
with a soda pop tap? i'd pay 60K for a 60 23 before i'd dish 30k for the
aunti bus. (well, let's not get ahead of ourselves) =A0 - steve, whose
bus looks more like ...hazel
