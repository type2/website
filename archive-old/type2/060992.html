Subject: Re: Engine Reccomendations - Old one seized !

Hi,

&gt; The garage has basically said that it is cheaper to get a Rec-con engine as
&gt; opposed to trying to repair the old engine.

 Hmm, that may be true but I would doubt the wisdom of taking the cheapest route. After all, Ford Transits and Bedford CFs are cheaper than VWs and you don't see as many of them around  these days for good reasons...

&gt; If I'm going to spend most of my time on the Motorway, what would be the
&gt; best replacement engine ?

 Well, for reliability, reasonable cost and availability of parts and service down the line I would advise a stock engine. A well rebuilt one should last a long time.
 
&gt; I thought to go for the biggest i.e 2.0l but the garage has said that
&gt; anything with twin carbs is going to require a lot of tuning.

 I disagree- the stock dual carbs used on the '72 to '82(?) engines require very little attention.
 Aftermarket Webers (etc.) are a different story, you will see many posts from people seeking advice on how to set them up (and a few from people reporting good service once that's done properly).

&gt; What experiance have you guys had ?

 Personally, not much wrenching experience, though I've been following the list discussions for a long time. My family's business has been running VW vans for  thirty years, however, and I learnt to drive in one.  Transporters are famous for their reliability in stock setup.

&gt; What reccomendation have you guys got ?

 Stay stock, preferably VW-bus-stock as the development work has been done for you. Trick engines are fine for show beetles, weekend cars and racing. VW stopped developing the upright engine at 1600cc to maintain reliability (started life at 1100cc, remember).
 For more power move to a type-4 engine. It is fundamentally stronger to handle the extra power and will have better torque (necessary in a large heavy box with the aerodynamics of a shed). I think this would be a challenge, but achievable, in '71 chassis. A 2000cc, dual Solex engine will give you  40% more power and loads more torque (twice as much?). This would still be &quot;stock&quot;, but for a later van.
 For more power still you'd either have to tune that engine (expensive, reliability suffers) or put in a (&quot;stock&quot;) engine that wasn't a VW  aircooled- Suspension and brake upgrades would almost certainly be a good idea as part of this project.
 
&gt; Is cruising at 75-80 mph an unrealistic goal for my Van ?

 Yes, to get that level of performance you would need much more power (90-100 bhp?) and to get that while maintaining reliability is quite difficult.
 Realistically, it would be far more cost effective to buy a newer van (a turbodiesel would probably be the best option).

&gt; If so what speed
&gt; does every one else go at ? Is this foot to the floor ? :-&gt;

 This was discussed recently, IIRC the answers were something like:

         engine            cruise _at_         longevity
    Stock upright:     50-60mph       good
    Stock upright:     60-65mph       not so good
     Trick upright:     60-70mph        poor
Stock Pancake:     60-70mph       excellent
Stock Pancake:     70-75mph       quite good
Trick Pancake:          75+           insufficient data
 Big non-VW AC
 (usually 5-8cyl)          75+                  good

 (Feedback invited from the list, this is my interpretation of the posts I've seen).

 This probably wasn't the sort of answer you were looking for. Sorry about that but I hope it's useful, nonetheless.

Cheers,
              W.
