Subject: Timing for 009 Distributor?

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1BE3D.DD7B6AA0

Hello, all.

Just upgraded to a 009 Distributor and Pertronix Ignitor (Part Number 184=
7V) on my '71.  Stock engine.  Still had the original Bosch distributor w=
ith points.  Timing for that was 5 degrees ATDC at idle.  Was told that i=
t's 7 degrees BTDC at idle for the new arrangement.  Sound right?  Have a=
 fairly new &quot;Made in Mexico&quot; coil.  Seems to be running okay.  May upgrad=
e to the Bosch blue coil if needed.  Any recommendations?  Thx. =20
