&amp;gt; Not specifically bus-related, but I was wondering how

&amp;gt; A helicoil in general is probably only a temp fix for
&amp;gt; anything that takes a vibrating or impact load
&amp;gt; (heads). Removing the bolt or stud is also likely to
&amp;gt; pull out or spin the helicoil, so for a sparkplug, the
&amp;gt; helicoils life is almost guaranteed to be finite.

OTOH, VW de Mexico installs helicoils in the mustache bar holes of type 1
engines at the factory!  Never had one come out or strip, which is more
than I can say for the tapped holes in original German cases.

Properly done, a helicoil is stronger than the original tapped hole and
should last as long as any other threaded hole.
