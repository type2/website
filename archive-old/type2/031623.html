&gt; I suppose I should have stated I understand all of the intricacies of the
&gt; swapping of a t1 and a t4.  I was curious how the 4XX's engine specs
&gt; compared with those of their distant t2 cousins...

well the 1700 actually was rated slightly higher HP than the 2l but a lot
less torque....from memory    1700 67hp
                              1800 54
                              2000 65

the compression ratio was higher etc.

I didn't have any problems with torque etc, but I have an auto tranny too
they protect themselves
