Considering that banning someone from an event is a pretty drastic
measure, and knowing the flack one is going to get for doing it, and
considering that my encounters with Thom have been universally negative,
I doubt very seriously that Thom is the victim here. I'm sure Larry had
a d_at_mn good reason for his action.

I applaud Larry for having to courage to stand up to a bully.
