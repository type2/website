Subject: Re: [T2] broken exhaust studs....

Hi Eddie,

My secret weapon for the exhaust-stud skirmish is a custom modified  
set of middle-sized vice grips. Not &quot;Mastercraft Locking pliers&quot;, but  
honest to goodness $14.99 Vice-Grips from Irwin Corp. The Real McCoy,  
so to speak. I bought them specifically with this task in mind,  
though it doesn't stop me from using them for other things.

In order to grip the stud from a perpendicular angle, I used my angle- 
grinder to put a V-shaped groove into the jaws of the vice-grips.  
This allows the pliers to contact the stud in four places instead of  
only two, and the pliers can also close slightly tighter, which  
allows a bit better clearance to spin the vice grips.

But in the end it was still too tight a working space, so i wound up  
removing the push rod tubes for the #1 cylinder. I heated up the stud  
cherry red, then applied some candle-wax to the base of the stud.  
Capillary action wicks it into the tight spaces between aluminum and  
steel molecules. Then I heated it again and quenched it with an ice  
cube, to shock it with thermal stress. After that I the vice grips  
yielded the satisfying CREAAAK!!! of the stud breaking free. It would  
only turn about 4 degrees at a time, but at least it was moving. Soon  
it was out, and a new stud in its place.


Happy trails,

&gt; I snapped 2 exhaust studs when taking off the manifolds on the  
&gt; engine I took from my parts bus.
&gt; The studs in question were pretty rusty and the nuts seemed to have  
&gt; cold welded themselves to the studs.
&gt; They snapped right at the nut with very little torque. I haven't  
&gt; had very good luck getting them out.

&gt; Anyone ever tried my screwdriver slot idea? Could threadlocker be  
&gt; holding these suckers in there way tighter than they
&gt; should be?
