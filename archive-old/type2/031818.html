&gt; im taking the plunge--if i find a reasonably priced kamper in my area (no. 
&gt; VA, west MD, near DC).

try Desmond's in Baltimore (410-665-8787) he frequently has some, be
warned Desmond does decent work but he tends to be overpriced so dicker
hard with him.

&gt; im looking for a good source for type 2s in my area. i already check the 
&gt; want ads and the truck-finder but im hoping there's a more reputable source 
&gt; in my area--like a club or some contacts with busses.
&gt; 
&gt; any ideas? or does everyone simply comb the want ads?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks!
