&gt;Has anyone had any experience with Fred's Garage in Redwood City. I'm 
&gt;thinking of
&gt;taking my '76 over to them and would like to hear some real world 
&gt;testimonials.

I took my '78 over for a smog a month or so back, and they nailed the 
problem dead-on, and didn't charge me for the diagnosis... They also 
fixed-gratis-an electrical problem I had.

Sadly, the problem was 60lbs on #3, so she's sitting in my driveway on a 
non-op right now, and will be for a couple of months before I have time 
for a teardown...

I posted the same question before doing the smog, and got several good 
responses. A search of the archives at the time found a couple more yeas, 
and one disgruntled nay-apperently a PO had gotten a rebuild there 9 mos. 
prior, new owner dropped  a valve or something, and Fred's refused to do 
anything about it.  

Overall, my personal thoughts based an a very limited exposure, are 
positive. YMMV, etc, yada yada yada...  ;-)


Peace,
