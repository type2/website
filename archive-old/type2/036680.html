&lt;&lt; Hi Ron!
 Re your 78 valve cover gaskets leaking from an install- it's very easy
 for the cover to ride up on the head and displace the gasket when you
 snap up the clip- first, grease the area where the clip rubs against. If
 the gasket is malformed from being stuffed somewhere, you may have to
 use silicone or other adhesive to hold it in the cover lip (I've used a
 bit of grease to hold a good gasket in place while tipping the cover in
 place), but never put adhesive on the head side!  Second, hold the cover
 when you place it over the head- move it around; you can feel when it's etc.



A couple of clips, four are better, welded to the inside of the valve cover, 
hold the gasket in place and lessen the chance of a poor seal due to sliding 
gaskets.
