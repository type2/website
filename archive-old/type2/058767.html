Well said, and: with the resources available to us it is FOOLISH to send
any substantial amount of money to ANYBODY on faith without searching for a
bad smell:

So since you have now got so many hints, if you ignore them you deserve
whatever happens to you. I would love it if this thread were over but I've
been around too long... =^ )
