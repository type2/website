Subject: Idiot new owner.

Hi, Eric here.

I am an idiot.  I bought an 82 Vanagon.  Still working on how to service
it!

Anyways, here is my question.

I have an 82, with a 2000 air-cooled.

I replaced the push rod tube seals, and valve cover gaskets.  Used
genuine VW parts.  After I was done, I test drove it, and noticed that
the oil was spurting out on the driver side.  I had noticed that the
valve covers are angled in a certain way, with a pressed &quot;eye-bolt&quot; or
&quot;ring&quot; on one corner.   I flipped around the valve covers, with the
little ring on the top corner.  I had put it on incorrectly the first
time.  I am still leaking oil from the covers, and I think the old
tubes.

Should I have replaced the tubes with new ones?

Should I have put a thin film of bearing grease on cover half  under the
gasket?

And lastly can you out the valve covers on wrong?

Another help would be how to seat the tubes back in without having to
tap them in from the rocker valve heads.  I am sure that I might have
done a little scoring on the surrounding metal.

Like I said, I'm an idiot.

Thanks.
Eric.
