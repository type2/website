&gt; A local bus pilot without internet access was asking me why his bus

&gt; cold, but in stop and go traffic it will stall.

Gregg

Is he shifting to neutral when he is stopping or is this just stopping and
the bus is stalling while still in Drive ???

first thing I would do is to make sure he has enough, fresh, correct ATF,.
and check the ATF filters too.
