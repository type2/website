Hi Robert,

Any type of sheet metal (preferably galvanized so it
doesn't rust) would work for this heat shield.  The
idea is to get an air gap on either side between the
heat source and the engine tin.  I have a heat shield
like this on a wood burning stove, and it's amazing
how the radiant stove heat is cut down by a thin sheet
of metal.  I'm sure the trick will be getting into
this confined space to mount such a shield.

Rob
