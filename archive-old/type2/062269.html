Subject: Copenhagen to Lillehammer and back in the 61.

&gt;Anyway, a bunch of us from the UK are going to drive our buses to 
 &gt;    Norway next summer to collect - big time

Sounds like VW heaven to me, folks.  A bit too prohibitive to haul my bus and self to Norway from Tennessee, though.  Sounds like a great trip!
