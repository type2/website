Subject: Free rear seats from '73 bus

Free to a good home,  the middle and rear seats from a 1973 bus.  Black
plastic with that familar VW texture.  Both in very good shape.
No cigarette burns or tears (I think).  These are in my parts bus which
is quickly becoming my winter storage shed.  
The seats are located in Western New York.  I don't think shipping is an
option.
Reply to this message if you are interested.
I may be able to find some other large '73 bus items to through into the 
deal (if the items are definitaly not compatible with a 1977 westy).
Sorry about &quot;throw&quot;!!
Brett
