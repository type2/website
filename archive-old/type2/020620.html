Subject: Looking for doors

Hello- I purchased a 78 Westy a little over a month ago. It's in pretty
good shape especially for the East Coast. I do have some rust along the
rockers and the typical windsheild rust. The rust around the windshield
is only surface and the same goes for the rockers.I checked the beam
over and can't see any bad spots on it. The only thing that needs
replacing or repair are the doors. The drivers had some poor body work
done and the pass side has rust along the bottom. I would like to find a
couple doors in great shape within reasonable driving distance. I'll go
anywhere in New  Hampshire,Maine or Vermont(always looking for a reason
to go north).If you know of any or have some yourself
please get in touch with me.
