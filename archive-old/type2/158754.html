When I  removed the old
cap and wired, I didn't pay attention to where everything  was. I know well
what wire should go where.



Hey Jon  This was your first mistake, not paying attention and  ASSUMING . 
The dizzy can go in just about anywhere anybody wants to wire it.  Some dizzys 
have the drive cog reversed, could be that whoever put the motor  together got 
the drive in wrong.To determine you need to set the engine up on  TDC by 
watching the valves not the dizzy and adjust accordingly.   later  mark Dearing
