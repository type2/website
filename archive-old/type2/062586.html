Don't call me, this was on the vanagon list. Call the attached number. 
(74 Microbus? Cross lister for sure!  %)

&gt;As seen in todays Omaha World Herald:
&gt;74 Microbus, 914 Porche engine, rebuilt tranny, very little rust 
&gt;$1850/best offer. 402.558.9707

&gt;Perhaps a cross-lister could forward this the brothers and sisters at typeII?
