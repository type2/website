Subject: Re: [T2] Dizzy Woes


  Then when I install the 205Q,
&gt;the rotor does not line up with the notch on the lip of the dizzy,


Rotate the distributor body until the notch and the rotor meet.  Also, be 
sure the dizzy is fully seated.  The gear is helical, and the rotor will 
turn a little when seated.

	Eron
