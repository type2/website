Well written and informative!  I like your style and would like to know 
what perils awati me up the Tehachapi run.  I have just purchased a 1977 
and am getting it ready for the road.  I am also a train fan and would 
like to go up the Tehachapi grade to see the incrdible loop in the 
railroad up there.  Did your trip take you past that area?
