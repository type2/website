Subject: Re: [T2] helicoil/threadsert options.

Timed inserts are another alternative, perhaps the best repair available,
the strongest, but they as well require a true drilling and tapping. The
easy way to get results is to tear it down and give the casting to a
machinist. Not the cheapest, mind you, but the only chance for a repair
that will function as intended, or better. A new casting is an acceptable
alternative for results. If that requires you come up with bucks you ain't
got, you can try an experiment in juris riggus rigorous.

If you rigorously clean it all spotless and bone dry, you can fill it with
JB weld and set a new stud, or you could set a TimeSert as well. If you
can't rigorously set it centered and dead straight, forget about it. Then
you'll be overdrilling the mating holes and you'll end up with a wreak,
juris rigus interuptus. Give it 2 days to set up HARD. Pray it is still
dead center and straight cause it ain't movin' now, bud. Clean up the
excess with a file, flat around the stud/sert, rigorously being careful not
to scribe a perfect stress riser around the base of a stud. When you
tighten down the nut/bolt use 80% or less of spec torque. If the flanges
are dead straight you will get a sufficient seal. 

If a flange is pitted badly, you can rigorously take the time to wire brush
it, hit it with emory, flush it clean with non-residue cleaner, then bone
dry. We're talking just one level down from steril, in other words,
sanitary. Lay on a thin layer of JB weld to fill the pits and valleys, let
it dry several hours, till you can file off the mountains without clogging
the rasp/file, then let it dry hard, then file it flat with a bastard. Dead
flat surface again. Jury rigging requires rigourous detail to have a modest
chance of success. Takes time, far more time then bolting on a new casting
if you are doing a water pump housing on a Rabbit.

If it's a $3000 Mercedes casting, you remove it and send it to the God of
Metals, the maschinist. If one thread was cooroded or overstressed, how
many others are not going to take spec torque when you go to fasten things
down????? Even if you properly retap them?? 

6x1.0 aluminum threads cannot stand any overtorquing when NEW. Once you
move them a scooch, all the tap will do is remove a bit more of needed
mass, so weakens them more. They will come out the next time they are
stressed with not too many inch/ounces more or less than spec torque. Third
man there ain't got a chance.

In your timing belt holding bolt senerio, if it's an interference engine,
don't compromise. If not and that bolt don't hold, it's a tow job fer sur,
but at least it won't ruin the engine. Then you can put on the new casting
or get the God of Metals involved who might tell you, buy a new casting, or
listen to the Devil again, as you will.

&gt;Working on a car in the garage,_at_ bolt hole threads(6mX1) are stripped that
&gt;hold the timing belt tensioned.  Break out the helicoil kit, one goes in
&gt;perfect, the other is screwed up.  Drilled next size up, and cannot line up
&gt;the tap.  My  thought is I drilled the hole crooked, no telling.
&gt;
&gt;I am running out of metal to drill.  Is there something sort of like a case
&gt;saver I can screw in that will work?   If so where can I find it?
