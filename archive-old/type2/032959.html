It's too early to predict long term, but I gave the floor
a thorough treatment: bare metal sandblast, POR 15 with
special attention to the many pin-holes, and then used
epoxy putty with enough pressure to ensure extrusion on
the bottom side of the floor.  Since I spray the outside 
with used motor oil 2-3 times per year, I think I am o.k.
Two years so far and only one of the epoxy plugs shows
rust stains.
