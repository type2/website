Subject: Re: [T2] Purple headlights

George,

I have been running Marsheal Euro lamps in my 325 BMW wth 80 / 100 bulbs
in them for 6 years, with no problems----

But --I took the time to aim them right so there wouldn't be any beefs
from the local jadams-- 

You just can't blame the law for getting real mad when an oncoming
vehicle blasts him in the eyeballs with flame throwers---

Why are H-4 lights illegal? or are they not DOT cert? 

That's exactly it. No &quot;DOT&quot; in the glass and it's not legal. 
That being said, I've never heard of anyone with properly aimed
headlights with proper bulbs being pulled over. The proliferation of
different headlight styles means that you can get away with a lot more
than you used to, as long as you don't glare or have an odd color bulb.
