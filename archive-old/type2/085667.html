Subject: Re:repair reservoir

Andy and Listees,
   You asked....&quot;has anyone ever fixed a cracked brake fluid reservoir.&quot;

   I've got to go against the list wisdom on this one.  When we got our '71 
the brake reservoir was cracked and leaking and I couldn't find one new or 
used.  I decided that I didn't have anything to loose by trying a repair as 
I wouldn't use the reservoir as it was anyway.
   I used a low wattage(15 watts I think), pencil type soldering iron to 
melt the plastic of the reservoir.  First thing was to thoroughly clean the 
reservoir inside and out with the last step being a water rinse.  After the 
reservoir was completely dry I attempted the repair.
  I used the soldering iron to melt the plastic at the crack using a 
circular motion, like when you weld.  Make sure the &quot;melt&quot; goes as deep as 
possible and isn't just on the surface.  This left a depression along the 
length of the crack.  Then I used the iron to melt and move plastic from the 
surrounding area to fill in the depression.  Be patient with this as it 
doesn't happen very fast.  Then I let the whole thing cool off.  All of this 
left a very uneven surface on the reservoir.  I used course sandpaper to 
smooth off the high spots so that I could add reinforcement to the outside 
of the reservoir.  As a reinforcement I cut a piece of fiberglass window 
screen the size and shape of that side of the reservoir.  Then I put a layer 
of a product known as proseal on the reservoir and embedded the reinforcing 
screen into it.   I put it aside for a couple of days, giving the proseal a 
chance to thoroughly set. Proseal is a product used in aviation, it's a 
sealant that,when dry, is flexible, and is resistant to a host of solvents 
and chemicals.  You might be able to find a good sealant in a marine store.
   Anyway, I did that repair over 2 years ago and that reservoir hasn't 
leaked a drop since.  But yes, I do still check on it to make sure it's 
holding up.
