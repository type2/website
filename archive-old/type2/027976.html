Subject: FI Troubleshooting/Wiring Question
Message-ID: &lt;GFHLIDMFIIKAHAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Following the FI troubleshooting procedure in the Type2 Library at:

                 http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/afc/

I came to the following advice(http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/afc/p_24c.html):

&quot;Switch ignition on and contact test light to terminal 88z and ground and then 86c and ground. 

If test light lights up on both terminals, replace relay       If test light does not light up, check and repair defective wire&quot;

Just to be sure, I thought I'd check here. My terminals (and the ballast resistors) only get juice when I'm *cranking* the bus; not when I turn the key to ON. This seems like a wiring problem to me, but I thought I'd double-check with *you*. Ignition ON means KEY ON right? Not &quot;starter turning.&quot;

Thanks! Joe

PS No, I haven't gotten this bus running except for a short stint. A whole bunch of things have kept me from focusing on it, but I'm hoping for better luck in the near future as I've been bumming rides from my wife for over a month and using a borrowed vehicle for months before that. The one thing I did since I had it running was replace the wiring to the cold start valve. I'm thinking I may have reversed the wires there, causing the current problem. I'm not sure if this is logical, but in my experience, when something new breaks, I must look to the last thing I &quot;fixed.&quot;
