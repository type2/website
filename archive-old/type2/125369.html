Subject: Re: [T2] Paint-it-yourselfers

I painted my 67 Splitty and it came out good enouth that the local Body Shop
owner offered me a job when he saw it sitting outside of the FLAPS.
Now I just bought a SATA Jet Rp digital gun and a 7 Hp air compressor. It
took a very long time and I had about $1500 in paint and supplies and tons
of labor in it. The gun made it a much better final job.
