John,


I have had a 69, 71 and now a 74 bus and it definately sounds like you are 
dealing with high mileage or maintenance issues.  The 1800 and 2000 motors 
are great engines and will last much longer than the 1600.  However, if they 
tired or abused too badly, they will not perform as well as a strong 1600.   

The suspension issues will depend directly on the condition and type of 
components you are running.  Stock OE type shocks should generate a very 
comparable ride in the two vehicles if original sway bars etc. are all in 
place.  Are the shocks OE or aftermarket, heavy duty, gas etc.?  It will 
change the feel.

Worn shift couplers, linkages, mounts, trans etc. will all impact your 
shifting, as will the condition of clutch disk, pressure plate, throwout 
bearing and engine oil seal.

Biggest difference you SHOULD notice is braking.  My 74 is in an entirely 
different stopping distance league than my 69 was.
