Subject: MOT

I was this [&quot; &quot;] close to having the Gov'ment stamp of approval on
Ras Bulli Split today.  Gunter had written out the inspection slip and
I raced over to the Minstry of Transportation office to register the
Bus before they closed [This is a segue unto itself...I had to get
them to change the registration from '67 to '66.  After explaining to
the Clerk and his supervisor that the 236 at the beginning of the
chassis number meant type-2, Kombi, '66 model year, they got out there
trusty reference manual and told I that they only had a model 231
listed for '66.  I said yes, that's it! They said no, yours is 236. I
then explained to them that their book should also have a 211-Panel,
241...etc. and that the 1, although part of the actual model number was
replaced by the digit for the year [from '65 on] and that before '65,
blah, blah, blah...Somehow I managed to finally convince them that I
was correct and they allowed the change [which means that I beat the
seat-belt law...]]

When I arrived back at Gunter's, he had noticed that the licence plate
light was not working.... I pulled it and tested the bulb and socket
on the battery...it worked.  I sanded the contacts, cleaned the
socket, tested again, it worked.  Reinstalled the light...no light. I
muttered two or three things, Grendal, two or three other
things...Gunter looked confused [I didn't have time to recount the
Grendal saga to him].  Anyhow...Gunter said that he couldn't pass the
bus without the plate light and said that he would give everything a
going over on Monday...I told him that I would be back tomorrow to run
new wires if necessary... So I left the bus [he has to adjust the
camber on the front anyways after replacing the king nd link pins]...

Maybe Monday...;)

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
