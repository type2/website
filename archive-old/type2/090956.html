Subject: 2.0 oil drain plug

Hi, I've been lurking here for a few months so I'll
start by thanking those who participate in this list
for providing me with some incredibly useful and
entertaining reading.

I just picked up a '79 Westy, 2.0L on Friday.  The oil
drain plug (the one to the side of the round strainer)
fell out yesterday.  Apparently the PO mechanic didn't
tighten it enough, and I didn't check it either.  I
shut the car down immediately - no harm done.  I've
plugged it temporarily with an older lug bolt from my
'69 - it goes in a few turns then stops.  I wasn't
about to torque it any further and it does drip a
little.

I've been told by one vendor and a dealer that this 
item is no longer available, but I called a VW
junkyard this morning and was told that the drain
plugs are the same as the 1600's.

Should I just get a regular (or magnetic) drain plug
for a 1600?
