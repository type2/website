Some of those small poptop baywindow Westfalias made it to the colonies.  On
this side of the pond they are sometimes referred to as &quot;Canadian poptops&quot;,
but they also show up in the States.

And there are genuine Westfalia Campmobiles running around with Dormobile
elevating roofs that were installed by Westfalia at the Westfalia werks.
[Not to be confused with genuine Westfalia Campmobiles that have Dormobile
elevating roofs that were installed in England by the Martin Walter folks.]

&gt;From time to time one hears rumors of genuine Westfalia Campmobiles that
have ASI-Riviera poptops installed.  I suppose that's possible -- Riviera
Motors was willing to do most anything to move VWs and meet the demand for
Type 2-based camper conversions.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I notice as I read some of the replies to your question that you were
being
told that Westfalia ONLY put wedge shaped opening roofs hinged at front and
rear on T2 Transporters - well this just ain't correct as they also fitted a
straight up pop top take a look at www.vanfest_dot_org/1997p25.htm for a 1978
Westfalia T2 Transporter with a straight up pop top.  &lt;&lt;
