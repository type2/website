I'm in the mood to praise; another story about Steve FWIW:
Spring of '96 Steve has a '79 he wants to strip and send to the junker; 
invites anyone down to help strip and take free parts.  I get there at 9:00, 
mention my slider in my '79 is broken as an aside and that I'll only have 
room to fit stuff in the back.

He says *hold everything* we'll fix my slider then start the stripping of his 
'79.  In a matter of seconds he had my slider off, with a new part off his 79 
and back working as new.    

His father shows up to this bus stripping party, food all around ,drinks...

I'm telling you this gentleman is a man for others.  *Live by example*

Thanks Steve
