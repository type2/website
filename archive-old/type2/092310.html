Subject: Re: [T2] Petrol Tank Breather

Matt,

I think this is fairly common.  I found mine had more holes and cracks
than solid material.  I wasn't able to find a replacement either so I
used a piece of fuel hose long enough to come off of it's mount on the
top of the tank and loop around to meet the metal vent line.  I believe
the purpose of this vent is to allow air and vapors to be pushed back up
to the filler to be vented out easier than force the air back up against
the incoming gas.  A loop in the vent shouldn't be a problem.  As long
as the hose is gas resistant and stiff enough to keep from kinking, the
pressure of the air trying to get out of the tank will find it's way
around the loop just fine.

My tank showed lots of indications that it had gas slopping out over the
tank for quite a while.  Not healthy!

&gt; I am finishing a resto on my 73 westfalia.
&gt; 
&gt; On the top of my tank I have a fuel Elbow that leads straight onto the
&gt; breather pipes.  This elbow has perished and although theoretically no fuel
&gt; runs through this pipe I don't want to put this old one back on because of
&gt; the petrol Vapour.  I don't want to stick normal fuel hose on there incase
&gt; it kinks and effects the breather system.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't seem to get a replacement for this anywhere.  I have tried VW, the
&gt; local VW/Camper &quot;Specialists&quot; and companies that I know produce fuel hose
&gt; and no-one can help me
