&gt; Question: I just drained the oil out of my '73 (acquired last year, so have
&gt; no idea how often, if at all, this oil was ever changed) and it was very
&gt; dirty.  Before filling it up with Amsoil and putting it back in the vehicle
&gt; (it's out at this time), should I flush it with something to get the crud
&gt; out?  If so, what should I use to flush?

If I think it needs a flush I fill it with the same tranny fluid I plan on
using, drive a couple hundred miles then drain and refill.

auto tranny this is just about the final drive, auto tranny fluid is
treated differently.
