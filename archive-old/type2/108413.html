&gt; &lt;&lt; Be creative.._dot_can you make a better one than the vw engineers did?
&gt; In my experience, this is one of those things that we can do a little
&gt; better on in our bus than the original...

&gt; Actually, yes...I use a solid brass &quot;T&quot; hinge bolted thru' the floor to
&gt; another
&gt; brass plate for reenforcement (a strip of old inner tube top and bottom to
&gt; allay electrolysis helps). The original pedal is bolted to the long leaf
of
&gt; the
&gt; hinge... :-)

    I too have replaced the hinge for the pedal with a standard hardware
hinge. I went one step further however and replaced the link  from the pedal
to the &quot;lever&quot; (swiveling piece that the cable hooks onto) with an
adjustable length link comprised of a two threaded ball or &quot;heim&quot; joints
with a threaded section between.
    This modification has improved the feel of the gas pedal dramatically.
Good Luck
