Subject: Exhaust resolved (mostly)!

Gotta give props to the local muffler shop:

Muffler Care
Anaheim, CA
Corner of Magnolia and Ball

I explained how I wanted the down pipes from the cylinder head cut off and 
welded to a new pipe running back to the muffler. The owner/manager (dunno) 
said he could do it in two flavors: $100 Quick &amp; dirty (and last a week). 
Or, $250 long and expensive and last 6 months. Apparently the issue is that 
the metal used by VW on the exhaust won't match the steel he has available 
to him. The different rates of expansion will cause the welds to crack. I 
was about ready to give up and start my hunt for cheap used HEs.

Then he asked if he could put it up on the lift and get a look at the 
problem. Up there I found a bazillion oil leaks. LoL

Anyway, he spotted the problem immediately. The DPO had stripped out one of 
the stud holes. I knew this, but he saw that our friend DPO had tried to 
drill it out... BUT WASN'T SQUARE TO THE OLD HOLE! It went off at a 10 
degree angle... The reason the down pipes were misaligned was to accomodate 
that funny stud angle. So when I was trying to put it back together nothing 
was right.

He repaired the stud hole (mig'd in a bit of aluminum in the head and 
re-tapped the hole) then cut the downpipes and re-welded them to the now 
heavily abused HE. Bolted all back up and the bus purrs instead of claps!

Cost? $90 out the door. Woot!!!

Now I can plan for new HEs at my leisure. WooHoo!!!
