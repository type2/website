Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead Console (LCD-TV)

Volks -

I have the pics of the overhead LCD-TV and DVD at:

http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~visket/STB/STBPics/

They start with LCDxxxx.

The wierd pics of the underbelly of the pop-top (barely) show the antenna, 
which is gorilla-snotted to the pop-top, and branches out to a &quot;tee&quot; at the 
rear of the pop-top. Reception is remarkably good, even with the pop-top 
down.

Audiovox no longer makes this model (AFAIK), but make a larger unit with 
more goodies. The new unit (IMHO) would still fit quite nicely and remain 
out-of-the-way.

Enjoy -
