I suspect what you have is a cheap tool. Remember what I've been saying=20
about bad data?? It will cost you far more in time/money than buying the=20
good tools in the first place.


&gt;Also,, We couldn't accomplish the leakdown test as I couldn't find a way=20
&gt;to lock
&gt;up the T4 in a Vanagon.
&gt;Usually I place the e-brake on,, trans in gear,, and hold the alternator=20
&gt;with a
&gt;wrench,, but the alternator nut wasn't accessible in this Vanagon,, and the
&gt;suspension torqed up just enough to allow the engine to rotate opening the
&gt;valves...
&gt;The next step would be to remove the rockers,,,

A leak down test MUST be done at TDC, because the greatest cylinder wear is=
=20
at the top of the stroke. I have never had a problem with getting the=20
piston to within 1=B0 so it can't move under pressure, as the rod is lined=
 up=20
perfectly. If the air pressure pushes the piston down, you weren't at TDC.=
=20
For two of the pistons you have the pulley mark. For the other two you must=
=20
use a screwdriver to feel TDC. Once you get it to hold, then mark the 180=B0=
=20
position on the pulley for further tests.
