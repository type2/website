Subject: bilge blowers

Hey Y'all,
  I was looking into the bilge blowers and this seens like a good and 
cheap upgrade (the kind I like). The thing that I am wondering is what 
size? The Detmar comes in two sizes 3 in 170cfm and 4 in 240cfm. Is the 
4 in 240 cfm to big or will this work good? Can the 70 Bus heating 
system flow 240 cfm or would this be too much? I want the max flow with 
out burning it up from trying to push too much air into too small a 
hole. They are both $20 so price is not an issue. Does anyone have a 
bilge blower in there bus, and what cfm rating is it? Hows it work? 
Could it flow more or is it working to hard? Any input would be great, 
I'm going to do this because I need the flow that I don't get at the 
slow speeds that I drive. The only time the window defrosts is when I'm 
on the freeway doing 60mph.
   I am also thinking of mounting them in the engine compartment like 
the fans on the 72up Busses but bypassing the engine fan and drawing the 
air in on each side above the engine compartment so I pull warm air from 
inside the bus and resurculate it haeting it up faster. Any thoughts?
