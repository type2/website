Subject: Re: [T2] FI to carburetor conversion 

Clay,

FWIW, try searching with &quot;single carb&quot; or &quot;dual carb&quot;;  you should find
plenty of opinions (approaching the fervor of religious arguements at times
;^) on those terms.  Also try Weber (sometimes Webber) or Solex or
whatever....

Good luck.

Subject: [T2] FI to carburetor conversion


&gt; I have owned a 1977 bus since it was new, and have periodically had lots
of
&gt; problems with the AFM (I'm on my fourth).  There is so much information on
&gt; this site regarding the problems people have with the AFM and FI in
general,
&gt; I'm considering converting the engine to carburetion. I've searched the
&gt; archives, mail list and libraries for information on such conversions and
am
&gt; surprised I have found nothing.  Perhaps I'm searching for the wrong
words.
&gt; Can anyone tell me where to look?  Anyone with experience doing this care
to
&gt; comment?  Thanks.   Clay Patrick
