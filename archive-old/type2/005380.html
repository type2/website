Hi all
I hope I have not missed part of this Thread.  re;meeting listee's and
having fun in Niagara.
I was wondering who is going to Niagara Falls for the Jitterbug?
My Daughter, (just turned 10 today)Vicki and myself will be going!
Has anyone set up a Listee meeting location? If not, feel free to hang out
at My Camper
www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers for a picture!
If there is something on already, please let me know.
It looks like I will be going Sat Night, Hopefully in time for the Cruise.
Anyone else going for that??  Lets Cara&quot;bus&quot; from somewhere to Niagara!
Please get back to me with your plans....
Thanks!

&gt;&gt;As a final note, can anyone tell me where in Niagara Falls is the 13th
&gt;Annual
&gt;&gt;June Jitter Bug being held.
&gt;&gt;&gt;From the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie, take the QEW just past Niagara Falls,
&gt;exit at Mountain Rd. West...Firemans Park is just down the road.
&gt;&gt;&gt;From the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York...Make a right onto
Falls
&gt;Ave.  Stay on that until you are on highway 420.  Take the 420 to the QEW
&gt;Toronto and exit Mountain Rd. W.
&gt;
&gt;Here is Marks original post with Jitterbug content...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope to meet some listees this coming weekend (June 20) at the June
&gt;&gt;Jitterbug, http://www.johnsbugshop_dot_com/page24.html , it was a great turn
&gt;out
&gt;&gt;last year...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The event is located in Niagara Falls, Ontario...about 25 minutes from
&gt;&gt;Buffalo, New York.   more info at the above link.  If your are coming let
&gt;me
&gt;&gt;know so I can be on the look out...I'll be there with Caroline (Red
&gt;&gt;Westy)...
