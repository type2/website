Subject: Looking for sliding door screen for my 77 Westy, have a new
  rear screen to trade.

I'm looking for some bits and pieces for my Westy: specifically the
knob/screw that holds the spare tire cabinet in at the top, and a sliding
door screen . I have a brand new never used rear screen to trade if anyone
is interested, or else I would just pay cash. I may need a few other things
as well. Anyone got this laying around in a parts stash?

Thanks

Courtney
