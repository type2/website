Hi Martin,

This may or may not be of use.....
As a disclaimer I have no association with these companies. I pulled them out 
basically at random (focus on campervan and budget type places though). Also I 
have never been to queensland myself. Looked for VW adds but there were none. 

I think to get to queensland you add 61 7, but I guess you would know that :-}
All offered one way rentals between brisbane and cairns.

Dam Cheap Car Rentals - sedans, vans, utes etc from 25 a day fax 3852 2563
Aust Rentals - campervans, fax 32560146, phone 1800 079 529
Apollo Motorhomes - 2-7 berth campervans, phone 1800 777 779

I can look more up if need be.
Hope this helps

ps regarding my earlier post on mystery squeaks, I think it is brakes related, 
but am waiting for some better weather/time to investigate further. Thanks to 
those who made suggestions.

Hi, I hope someone on the list from &quot;down under&quot; can help me with
this. Are VW busses or anything similar available for rent in
Brisbane, Australia?
