Hrmph.

First off, the fuel pump runs ONLY while it is starting.  The second you
let go of the key, it stops.

More then once it fired, and attempted to run for half a second.  Even
then, though, the pump stoped when the key was released, then the engine
died.

Performed a modified version of the fuelpump checks in the AC Bentley.

Bridged the 36 and 39 terminals on the air sensor harness, and turned the
key on.  Pump should run.  It did not.  Hit the &quot;start&quot; position, and it
runs.

Checked the resistance on the temp sender.  2.9k ohms, if I recall. (it
was in spec, though)

Performed the injector &quot;Voltage supply at injectors, checking&quot; test.
Nothing.  None of the 4 injector wires light my test light. (test light
works, and confirmed that it still did)  Bentley refers me to &quot;AFC
Troubleshooting guide (page 7) no. US 42-00-5955-1.&quot;

Any ideas on what causes THIS, since I dont have the specified book?

Also did &quot;Thermo-time switch, checking&quot;.  Works fine.

Out of sorta desparation, I tried hotwiring the fuel pump. Pump running,
bus would still start for just ~1 second, then die.  almost like it
runs off the cold-start injection...*sigh*


Looking for more ideas.

thanks...david
