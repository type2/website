&gt;I was driving the Bus to the VWoA headqueaters and all at once I began
&gt;to loose power and there was an excessive amount of blow by.  Everyone
&gt;kept saying that I had to have thrown a rod - I know what that sounds
&gt;like - my engine still sounds perfect - no helicopter rattle - no
&gt;cicadas - nothing.  I took it to a shop, and they told me that they
&gt;thought I blew a rod.  I took it home and did a compression test and the
&gt;3rd cylinder is at 0 psi almost every time (the other cylinders all test
&gt;out fine, well with acceptable range).   What can I do to remedy the
&gt;situation, I can't afford a new engine or a several hundred dollar
&gt;repair bill?  

You're in a tough spot then.  You did the right thing by giving it a
compression test.  When I got my bus it was similar to what you described,
and I had a hole in one piston (major blowby).  You might also have a
dropped valve seat or burnt exhaust valve.  I'm sorry to have to say it but
if you have zero compression in one cylinder you are almost certainly
looking at a top end rebuild (heads) at a minimum, and possibly a full
rebuild.  If I were in your shoes I would pull the engine, take it apart
and diagnose it (mostly just for my own information) and then probably
order a rebuilt from AVP - about $1500 I think.
