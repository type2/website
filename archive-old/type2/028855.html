I just finished putting a new set of points and a condenser in my 76 Westy.
I used the article from the technical library as a reference.  Everything
went OK except for the fact that I can't keep it running long enough to
adjust the timing.  I adjusted the points gap to .016 and have been playing
around with the width but nothing seems to work.  I can get the thing
started but it runs extremely rough and I have to keep giving it gas for it
to stay running.  I can't keep it running long enough to check the timing
with a scope.  Any suggestions?  I am new at this so please be descriptive.
Thanks in advance,
Phillip Freund
