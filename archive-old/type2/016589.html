&gt; 1/2&quot; hose is very expensive: the NAPA retail price is

&gt; sold it to me for $2.69 a foot.  Lest you think this is
&gt; outrageous, the VW hose (from the dealer sells for $83.
&gt; for 3 meters.

       What I used is fiber-reinforced vacuum hose from Fleet-Farm. I think
it's for milking machines. Anyway, it was pretty much dirt cheap compared to
those prices. And -- it's one heck of a lot sturdier than the orginal stuff.

       Don't know what your problem with the manifold fitting size is,
because I never had that problem. Orignally I had a Weber progressive carb,
and manifold vacuum fitting on that was same size as the hose. Now that I
have FI restored, that, too, is the same size.
