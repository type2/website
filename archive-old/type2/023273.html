Subject: replacing exhaust manifold gaskets
Mime-Version: 1.0

has anyone done this before?  this is one of the items on my &quot;failed 
inspection&quot; list.  i bought the metal gaskets yesterday, and plan on taking 
on the job tomorrow.

i'm also replacing the steering coupler and installing my new oil pressure 
and oil temp gauges.

so, any input would be very helpful.  thanks again.  i have 1 month until 
departure, and i have a bunch left to do...not to mention, work a job until 
then too.
