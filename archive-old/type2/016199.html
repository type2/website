Advice? Replace the stud. Don't know of any way around it.  My 2.0L rebuilt
head had a stripped rocker arm stud right out of the box so I went to a
parts store that I get a lot of parts from and he let me salvage a few from
the cores he had not sent back to the rebuilder.  I now have a couple of
spares.  Replace the old nut also because it may be damaged and it will
continue to cause problems.  They only torque to like 10 lbs or something
and they are very very easy to strip.  Good luck.

Despite being very cautious about backing off the nuts evenly and
slowly, the front stud on #1 seems to have backed out a bit.

I think my pal torqued it a bit too much after we replaced that valve
spring...

Advice?

Thanks,

Teri
