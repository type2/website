Subject: RE: [T2] Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

They were these &quot;special edition&quot; buses and bugs (I think) that they put out
in the late 70s. My father has a 77 Champagne edition bus, mint condition,
but needs a new paint job due to fading. I cannot tell a single difference
with the bus, save chrome bumpers, a different paint palate, and this little
VW Champagne Edition sticker between the windshield wipers. Other than that,
it's pretty much stock. Maybe kind of like the &quot;special edition&quot; cars we see
on the road today... not really all that special!
