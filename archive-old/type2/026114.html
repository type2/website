I have a vinyl floor in my bus because it's a lot easier to keep clean,
but this winter I've used a carpet tile as a 'door mat' next to the side
door that the kids can wipe their feet on.  You could do the same, or
use an offcut of the carpet that you install.  When it gets really
dirty, you just take it outside and shake it out or wash it, or just
throw it away and cut a new piece.
