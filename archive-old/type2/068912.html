Hmmm.  This is *exactly* what I found after installing the new booster
relay.  The old switch was providing eight volts when on (twelve when
in `start'), which wasn't enough to run the 12volt starter, but was
way more than enough to run the relay.  At least I proved the starter
runs really well, at least without an engine attached.

Two in the same day.  I wonder if it's A Sign?

In any case, since I don't have access to a VW-aware FLAPS at the
moment, I'm pressing a universal ignition switch into temporary
service.  Terminal fifteen goes to `ign', thirty to `st', and fifty to
`bat'.  At least, that's how it seemed to work on mine....
