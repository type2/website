&gt; No big problem. Buy the same model pump (generator model or alternator
&gt; model)that is working for you now. After you remove the old pump, turn the
&gt; engine through and observe the pump push rod rise and fall. Make sure the
&gt; maximum height it sticks out above the base spacer is the same as called out
&gt; in the pump install instructions. They recommend some lube as well.

If you're changing the pump and it isn't the alternator style one I'd
recommmend getting the alternator style pump and pushrod.  Function is
identical and if you have an alternator-style pump a later conversion from
generator to alternator (a very popular swap) is made a lot easier.
