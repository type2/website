Subject: Parts Request &amp; A Question.

Thanks to R. E. Haufler for helping me diagnose a brake problem.  It appears 
my brake booster/servo is bad.  So here's the parts list:

Brake Booster/Servo
Thermostat &amp; cable
Front lenses that go over lights to either side of fresh air intake.
Rear side lenses that go over running lights on either side of the back of 
the bus.

These are for my 74 Standard Bus.  Don't care if parts offered are of same 
year, as long as they fit and work.

I know some of these things would probably be better bought new or rebuilt 
(brake servo, thermostat), but I am pretty poor and willing to take the risk 
of it going bad again shortly.  I am hoping somebody can hook me up with 
these parts for relatively little money and in time to try to get to HCBF 
(still trying but things are looking pretty grim).  I'm not looking for 
something for nothing, I know that these are pretty expensive parts new (I 
checked), but whatever you can do for me will be appreciated and 
reciprocated in any way I am able.  I have some typeI parts and a set of 
vanagon sliding windows for barter if anyone is interested.

If I show up to HCBF in my Ford, are you going to laugh and point?  I really 
want to go, but I don't think I can get it together in time.  It might kind 
of help to go to the event to pick up parts that I need.

Thanks for helping a &quot;Newbie.&quot;
