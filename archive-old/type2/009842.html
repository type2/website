Sibling airheads:

My 1600SP rebuild experience continues to disappoint me.

Those following this tale may recall my careful prep, money spent 
on case savers and balancing, only to end up with an engine that 
seized after less than 30 minutes of operation, toasting new cam, 2 
followers, &amp; bearings.

Local VW guru of longstanding rep diagnosed it as the wrong oil 
pump.  He also recommended I get a .009 dizzy and something a 
bit bigger than the PO's 28 PICT, especially since I have that nice 
S&amp;S header.

$500 (not including carb, cam, lifters, and dizzy, which I picked up  
separately) later, the engine runs fine in the guru's shop and I take 
it to the farm to put it in my '71 westy.

Started up quickly and ran much better than previously (due to carb 
and dizzy, no doubt).  But it cut out once almost immediately, with 
that arrested spin-down (imagine brake shoes) that I'm getting used 
to.  Restarted and it ran fine; let it run in per the guru's instructions.

A week later I'm back at the barn and I start it again.  Runs fine for 
a few minutes then stalls after a throttle blip.  Starter cranks very 
slowly and quits.  Smoke from where the ground strap connects 
with body - a lotta current.  Starter no longer responds.  By hand, 
motor rotates a degree or two then clunk - stops.

I thought it might be a bad starter (what else can go wrong?) but I 
pulled that and the engine's still locked up tight.

So I gotta pull it again, tear it down.  Gotta call and harangue the 
local guru.  (For someone lazy and conflict-phobic, this ain't good.)  
 Gotta figure out what to do and right now I'm mainly TWEAKED 
about the $ and time that's gone into a &quot;simple&quot; rebuild that does 
not seem to be able to lubricate itself.  Why else does it keep 
siezing?

Trying to decide whether to just sh*tcan this case and get a 
shortblock somewhere.  I'd have been WAY ahead of the game if I'd 
just dropped $500-800 on a rebuilt long block.

I put the GRRRR in anger, baby.

OTOH:

- my whining over these travails allowed me to convince my wife to 
let me move the bus home from the barn, so it's no longer an 80-
mile roundtrip away.  Last night I sat in the back and made 
vrooming noises, and got the turn signals working.

- I was sorta sad to bring it home, since I've perversely enjoyed the 
three seasons of lying on my back in red-clay dirt amid the ant-lion 
pits as dirt-daubers and june bugs whine past; can't just take out 
the machinist's hammer at 3AM and duet with the whippoorwills 
here in town.  Saturday afternoon my move-home preps were 
interrupted by a 20-minute downpour that roared on the barn's tin 
roof so loud you had to shout.

- if I'd gone ahead and bought a rebuilt longblock, I'd *still* be 
wondering if I could have done better myself. ;-)

No particular advice sought, just venting.
