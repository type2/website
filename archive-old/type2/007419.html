Subject: Bus dual port manifold
Date: Sat, 24 Oct 1998 03:53:58 PDT

Hey Y'all,
  I have a 1600 dp manifold with the 1/2 inch port on it for the power 
brake booster. This part only fits the Bus with a 1600 and disk brakes, 
1971. It aslo fits the Beetle with Auto-stick. It is nessesary if you 
are going to put a 1600dp in your 72-79 Bus to maintain the power 
booster. It also has the oneway check valve. I will sell or trade this 
manifold. Just make me an offer or tell me what you have that I might 
want for my 70 bus. I'm sure it not worth a lot but I know that if you 
need one you can never find something like this, so I am letting you all 
know I have it if you want it. Things I would trade it for: 68-71 
bumper,side window,sliding door rear latch, standard dp manifold. What 
ever.
  I just hope I can help someone find a part they need, I don't need it.
