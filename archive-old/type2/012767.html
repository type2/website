Well we are holding at around 30 buses for the overnighter
at springmeet on the 28th, (THE SHOW IS THE 29th).
  This is a Wet Westy gathering at a show put on by the
NWVWC(busdriver_at_northwestvwclub_dot_org).
  For more info go to the link on my site which also has
links to Wet Westy site and the host club (Northwest VW
club) site. Shaping up to be a great gathering!
  NWVWC is probably the oldest ongoing club in the North
West _at_ 30 plus years.
