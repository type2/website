Subject: Bay window door lock syndrome

Kevin HTell me- Is the symptom of your problem, you can lock the drivers door
with the key, no problem. You can then unlock it with the key, no problem.
But, if you sqeeze the button in between the two actions, you can no longer
unlock the door with a key?
If this describes the problem, you have bay window door lock syndrome. The
article by Ron Vanness describes how to fix it perfectly. I've done both doors
on my bus. They work so well and so sweetly with new springs in there. It's a
weak design if you ask me.

Don't force that button, as George Lyle said, white metal doesn't bend, it
breaks.  It either works easily or cease operations and fix.

ps   It isn't really easy to get the coil spring in the mechanism, but it can
be done and should.

Hey, guys.  My driver's side door latch is sometimes hard to open.  Usually
it works ok, but occasionally I have to use both hands to squeeze hard
enough for it to open.  I tried PB Blaster in it but no help.  I haven't
taken the door panel off and looked around yet but I just wondered if this
is a common bus problem and how it's fixed.  Thanks....KR
