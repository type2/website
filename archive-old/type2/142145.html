Subject: Re: [T2] Speaking of Bruck of Germany/Made in...

I see alot of German quality but no mention of made in Germany... 

&lt;I looked at the ad...... where does it mention Bruck?&gt; Nowhere...

Went to a Cooper/Michelin tire dealer to have a tire patched on the Cabrio on Saturday. Big banner inside proclaiming &quot;American Owned&quot; and the second line said &quot;Quality Made&quot;. At first glance my brain read &quot;American Owned&quot; for some reason. Nice way to say that the corporate bigwigs at in the USA while the factories are in Mexico or some other far away land. 

Cooper, Wal-mart, etc is going to have to try harder if they want me to believe they are true patriotic American giants... &lt;grin!&gt;

Used my &quot;Chicago Tool&quot; sander last night on a side note. Made in China...
