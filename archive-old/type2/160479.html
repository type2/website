Subject: Re: [T2] firewall clearance

 &gt;Does anyone know how much clearance there is between the firewall
and the fuel tank?

I want to mount my new XR700 ignition module close to the series
resistor. I don't want the sheet metal screws to hit the tank
 &gt;if the tank is right up next to the firewall.

An &quot;old skool&quot; trick to avoid drilling too deep is to drill through a 
piece of wood first so that only the required length of drill bit 
sticks through. The wood then acts as a stop when you drill through 
the firewall.

Cheers,

Martin.
