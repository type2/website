&gt;   i know theres  homeschooling but can this be done... the whole concept?

It can be done, but the question is whether you want to make such a
drastic change in your lifestyle.  Just educating the kids is a
6-hour-per-day job.  You have to plan and execute all the lessons and
the planning is just as much work for two students as for 20.  This
doesn't leave much time for travel.  For a short time this might be an
interesting adventure, but in the long term your kids would end up hating
the bus and you might not like it so much either.
