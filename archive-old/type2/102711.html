Just measure the ID of the cylinders.  If they are 2L parts, it will be 94mm.  You should be able to pick up a vernier caliper for under $20 that can measure this (which you will find yourself using frequently, if you're like me) but if you can't/won't do that, even a metric tape measure should be good enough to tell the difference between 2L jugs (94mm) and 1.8L jugs (93mm).
