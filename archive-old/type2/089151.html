Try switching to straight 40W or 50W Valvoline Racing Oil. It's too =
thick for cold weather starts, but should help with oil pressure during =
the warmer months.

Also check the electrical connection on the oil pressure sender, which =
is located at about the 10 o'clock position from the distributor as you =
look at it from behind and above the engine. The oil pressure sender =
sometimes cracks and leaks oil and may eventually blow, sending a gusher =
of oil all over the engine. It's cheap to replace, about $9 or so.

I know the beast needs new mains, they are tired at 130,000 miles, but I =
want to drive it for the summer and do that in the winter. It runs =
20-50wt, but after a good hard drive at 60mph the oil light will come on =
at idle. Is there a bandaid fix for this to last the summer? Would one =
of those oil pressure adjusters bump up the pressure to let it hang in =
there until the winter so I can tear it down? It's a 79 2.0 L Westy.
Thanks,
Courtney&lt;&lt;&lt;
