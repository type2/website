&gt; &gt; I do use on grades, but the tranny will upshift anyway if you overspeed.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure about the upshift thing? Mine has NEVER done this. Being that

yup, it says so in the manual and mine has done it.  it is self
protection to keep from damaging the tranny.  It is pretty much at the
engine red line when it does it, sounds like the engine is going to blow
up but it will do it (at least the Late Govenor controlled ones will)

&gt; mine is an Air-Cooled_Auto_Vanagon_Westy, I feel like I have some
&gt; familiarity with manipulating the gears for the best possible management of
&gt; the underwhelming power available. I use first up to 30MPH (which I feel is
&gt; probably decadent) and second up to 50 or even 55 if I am up against some
&gt; performance machinery.

you really shouldn't use the shifter like a manual in an automatic, put it
in drive and let the tranny do it's thing
&gt; 
&gt; I do the same things as you on downhill grades, (but I repeat) I have never
&gt; experienced an upshift to a higher gear than the one I have selected with
&gt; the lever. 1-2 when in 2 but never 2-3 in 2.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I be winding it out more?

no, the down shift is a &quot;self protection&quot; system in the tranny.  I highly
discourage using the shifter while moving except in an emergency, the
shifter is too easy to get into the wrong gear.
