&gt; A few notes that may help some people.  To get the old circlips off,
&gt; what I 
&gt; did was stick a pocket knife under one edge, and pried upward.  This
&gt; gave 
&gt; room for a flat head to fit under, and then leverage to pry off.

When prying, try to flex the circlip as little as possible, lest you
tweak it or damage its groove.  You will cuss a lot less with a good
pair of circlip pliers

&gt; The new boots, bought from RMMW 3 or so years ago and stored until
&gt; now, were 
&gt; different from the old ones.  The metal part of the boot had ridges
&gt; on it, 
&gt; that would NOT allow the cv bolt washer(square 2 hole port thingy) to
&gt; sit 
&gt; flush with the boot.  Obviously I left those washers off, again I
&gt; rechecked 
&gt; torque after 10 minute drive and all were good.

Be sure that there is sufficient clearance for the end of the bolts! 
It's pretty tight even with the tabs installed!  I've never seen boots
that didn't allow use of the locking tabs, but there are a lot of
variations available.  Don't toss the tabs, as you will want to
reinstall them the next time you change boots.

&gt; Apparently snap ring pliers DO work for this job, just not for me.  I
&gt; drove 
&gt; all over today to find the best value for them and it turns out they
&gt; were 
&gt; useless.  

It helps to use a file or a dremel tool to put a little notch on
opposite sides of open gap of the ring.  This will prevent the pliers
from slipping. 

&gt; Lastly, people recommend torqueing CV's at another 500 miles.  Last
&gt; time I 
&gt; did this I actually checked them at 50 miles, and found them to be
&gt; slightly 
&gt; loose.  YMMV.

My experience too.  I check them when I adjust my brakes.
