Subject: Re: [T2] Junkyard Sadness

I am including the purchase price.

I did help my mom tow her truck to a dealership because it broke down, we 
cruised around Bend in my bus and got lunch while it was repaired.

I think I have spent closer to $3600.00 in reality, my time is worth little, so sure, lets say it is included.

&gt; &gt; but I don't care, while I have spent $4000.00 on my bus my mom has spent 
&gt; &gt; $9900.00 in car payments on her F250 at $550.00 a month. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You includin' your time in that equation...?
