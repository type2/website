Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for a bus accessory

Nah man...you are much more rotund than I...hahaha

Because I paddle so much my shoulders and chest are in great shape but my
legs and lower are not as healthy.

One thing is for sure though, we both share that bus hunch only a VW driver
gets from leaning over the wheel on those long trips each of us have taken.

Good to hear from you man.  Come when you don't feel like you can get away
and stay a day longer than you feel you need to.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Well...I am looking for another bike.  I am a big man, 6.4/275 lbs. give or
&gt;&gt; take an ounce so I need a bike for a tall man.  I would prefer a fat tire
&gt;&gt; model in good shape.
&gt; 
&gt; Heck Charlie, you're like me, we don't need fat tire bikes, we need dual
&gt; tire bikes and stick an engine on mine!!
