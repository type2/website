Subject: Re: [T2] Looking at my first 78 Westy


&gt; I just took a look at a 78 Westy and had a few questions that I couldn't
find on the web and a few books I have.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Is there a way to find out what options/colors were on the 78 Westys?
The one I looked at didn't have the sink/stove and the storage closet was on
the passenger side when I'd usually seen it on the drivers.  Is it supposed to
cover up a window or did this piece not belong on this bus? Were the sink and
table an option or is this bus probably missing it?

In the USA, only the P-22 [non deluxe] Sage green and P-27 [deluxe] Dakota
beige Westies were offered. The Sage green came with green plaid, the Dakota
beige came with brown plaid.
[the Champagne Edition was also offered in non deluxe and deluxe, they came
with the brown plaid only]

&gt; And, if anyone can recommend a site that has the old fabric/material
patterns for the seats and beds, that'd be great.  The roof mattress and the
two front seats still had the green/gold plaid but the rear seat didn't.

Pictures of the material? Yes, go here: http://john-perry_dot_com/vw/index.html
and click on 'plaid fabric' on the left.

Material itself?  No longer available. Only source I know of is used from
wrecked buses.
