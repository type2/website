Subject: Lopsided Butt...(er, *bus*;-)

Hey all,

I just got home from another gruelling double-shift,
and I can't wait for some sleep (gotta unwind, first,
though), but I need list advice on something I've
never seen/experienced before...

My bus ('69 Westy) *seems* to have a very noticeable
cant (or slant, if you prefer) to the passenger side
when viewed from the rear. From the front, it seems
normal.

I say *seems*, because I can't seem to find any truly
level ground to park on so that I can measure it
properly.

However, everywhere I seem to park, the bus seems to
be out-of-level.... The right (right/passenger) side
seems to sit about 1&quot;-1.5&quot; *lower* than the left side!

Now, I live on a hill, and my driveway slants at an
odd angle, so when I first noticed this phenomenon, I
thought it was the funky driveway causing it. But at
work tonight, I noticed the same thing in the parking
lot as I was leaving, and I'm not so sure it's all in
my mind anymore.

Granted, the parking lot has that same funky slant as
my driveway, but not as severe...yet the bus seems to
have the same degree of offset from side to side
(still 1&quot;-1.5&quot; lower on the right side) :-/


Also, when I first noticed this, I had the original
rear bumper that had a pretty good-sized dent in it. I
figured the bent bumper, being the lowest viewable
body part (when viewed from the rear), was the
culprit. I have since put on a straight bumper (using
my old brackets and hardware), but the problem's still
there. I suppose the brackets may be bent, but I don't
know.

Any ideas????

I will attempt to find a level spot to take some
measurements (both front and rear), but I'm curious as
to what else it might be. I will also check it using a
plumbob for accuracy, and check it from both ends of
the bumper, as well as from both sides of the frame.

All four tires were new about 7,000 miles ago, and I
*did* have to replace the left-rear tire about 6
months ago (torn sidewall). I realize the new tire is
*slightly* taller, as the others have lost some tread
(not much, though), still....I can't imagine it would
cause this much difference. Maybe I *should* rotate
the tires front to back, though (yes, I read Muir's
reasons for not rotating too;-)


The particulars:
~'69 Westy
~7/8&quot; Sway-Away sway bars (I've done a bit of
checking, and don't think this is the culprit, but
never say never)
~KYB Gas-Adjust shocks (working fine...no noise over
bumps, anyway). 


As usual, any help will be greatly appreciated!
