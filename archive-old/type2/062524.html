&gt; I've had a couple of requests to expound on the existence,

&gt; BAJA Bus.  Well here goes:
&gt; Envision a Baja Bug, transmogrified into a bus:
&gt; Wheel wells have been cut a lot bigger, larger tires, raised
&gt; suspension, earlier bus axles (greater clearance with gear boxes)
&gt; sometimes.  Usually a larger, more powerful engine installed.
&gt; Generally looks beat up.  The kind of vehicle that when a
&gt; collision occurs, usually loses, but owner doesn't care.
&gt; I could be wrong, I haven't actually seen this bus, could be in great
&gt; shape, but probably still have the modifications though.
&gt; NOT for the 'complete restoration' type of person.

&gt; BTW did a spell check on this post, 'transmogrified' did NOTshow up
&gt; as a mispelled word! This software stuff never ceases to amaze me!

Ah yes, I've seen one of those. I never did get the point, though. I 
suppose it could have been handy on that run up north, though.

I picked up a copy of VW Trends last week, and they mention a similar 
bus. As I recall, these conversion were done in the early 70's (the 
article is at work), and they saw one at a show they were reporting. 

Any way, about a dozen were converted to 4 wheel drive... most of them 
ended up in the US. From Bob's description of the trip north, I wonder 
how one of these would have handled the mud. Of course, they would be 
&quot;too valuable&quot; to risk on actually driving. &lt;grin&gt;
