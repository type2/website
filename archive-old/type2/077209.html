Subject: Re: [T2] in need of piston and exhaust valve

&gt; &gt; A bus brother is in need of a 85.5 mm piston and a 35.5 exhaust valve.
He
&gt; &gt; would prefer used to match the ones already in the engine, but still in
&gt; &gt; usable shape.

&gt; Hey Snoopy, isn't that supposed to be a 32mm exhaust?
&gt; Courtney

He has oversized heads....  He told me (he is a VW mechanic) that was the
numbers he needed.  SO that was what I asked for...  He had a line on some
but the cops made us put them back...  We had permission from the owner  but
that is another story...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He (Derek) has had his bus off the road for months.  Please help him to
&gt; &gt; drive a bus again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please respond to me and I will get the message to him.
