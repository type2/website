Note to European listees - moves are afoot to make bull bars illegal in the
European Union, so if you're thinking of fitting a set, it's worth bearing
this in mind.  Also, while bull bars might keep your nice shiny nose dent
free, the kid who runs out in front of you will not be dent free :(

&gt; I recently creased the front of my '78 Westy (didn't put a mark on the
&gt; old Chevy that I tapped....much higher bumper!).  I remember a
&gt; discussion (and a set of plans) from years gone by that detailed a
&gt; &quot;bull bar&quot;, possibly Australian in origin.
