Subject: RE: [T2] Change those fuel lines

Okay, I am sold. My 78 brown/white Westy brings those photos to close to
home. 

I read over Ratwell's Article
http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/VacuumHoses.html 
I have the 2.0 FI as well
Fuel line and Locating Hose section 
Do I order everything in the table? 

I also read the post in the archives from Patrick Flynn
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/070215.html
Patrick references American Measurements of hose 5/16 rather then German
Metrics that Ratwell lists. Prefrences?
Patrick later says to use quality German injection rated hose,

Does any one location have all of it?

Is there a kit for all of the hose?
 
Do I need to do the vacuum lines now as well?

I am not a major grease monkey. So Ratwells photo diagrams will help a
ton.

&gt;I really hate to post these photos but it's an important reminder for
anyone who thinks they can save $15 and not replace &gt;the original fuel
lines. This was a really nice bus:
