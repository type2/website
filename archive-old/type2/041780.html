Subject: Up and Running

73 bus is up and running.  Had a few problems after changing fuel filters 
and adj. valves yesterday.  Ended up being the timing. Lock nut on Dist. was 
not tight and it sent the timing to a different dimension.

Note: I'm using a 009 dist. and even though I &quot;static&quot; time the engine it 
still would not start.  I had to continue advancing it til it started.  
Then, put the Tach Guage on it and set to 30 degrees.

Runs fine and Electrical wiring is almost done!

Thanks for all the help!
Lo
