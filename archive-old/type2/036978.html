Subject: Chasing the Miss

...or missing the chase?

It all started with a holey muffler. I was getting some miss/backfire and I
could see the muffler developing holes. I have a killer stainless muffler
that's awaiting repair/replacement, so I didn't want to invest $40 in
another cheap muffler only to have it dissintegrate again. Better to put
$20 into an extractor muffler.

But with the extractor muffler on, I could hear popping and backfiring even
moreso. I figured this was just because of the dynamics of the extractor,
which causes sound to resonate. So I started chasing other problems....like
my sloppy distributor: replaced. and plug wires: replaced. and rotor:
replaced. and distributor cap: replaced. Why is it I'm thinking the parts
guy loves me?

I checked for exhaust leaks and found none. It stalls right on when I plug
the tailpipe.

I set the timing dead on, but 3 things are happening that bug me: 1. miss
as I gain RPMs. 2. backfiring as I let off. 3. I'm seeing very high advance
as I gain RPMs...like 40 where it ought to be 28.

Any ideas?

Thanks! Joe
