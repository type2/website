Subject: Re: rear main seal question

Hey Beth.  Very nice to hear from another female VW enthusiast!  I started 
working on Consuela when I got tired of paying someone to drop the engine and 
fix oil leaks, that never seemed to get fixed!  Can you believe one garage 
actually left the parts I had bought for the leaks in the front seat of the 
van when I went to pick her up?  I was livid!!   I bought Muir's book and the 
Chilton's (don't get that one).  Muir's is very helpful especially with the 
drawings.  That's how I got to know what each part was on the bus    (no 
laughing from the guys, please).  I had never even changed oil in a vehicle 
before all this, but now, that has all changed.  I've replaced the oil 
cooler, push rod tubes and seals, and I'm now replacing the rear main seal. 
Hopefully I'll have her put back together within the week.  I'm not sure 
about timing her, which I know needs to be done.  Any suggestions from the 
experts out there???

Talk to you soon. Keep in touch, Beth.
