Scott,

For reliability, I would go with the type 4 engine any time.  It's a
much more solid motor (read heavy) and was designed to handle the power
in the first place.  It also has a lot of detail improvements which you
would expect from 30-odd years of experience building air cooled motors.
You get these as standard with the type 4, they're not add-ons.  There
is plenty of torque with the 2.0L as well (as I recall, something like
100 ft lb.)
