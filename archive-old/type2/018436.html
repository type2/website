Subject: Leaks fixed but still smells
Message-ID: &lt;375F9494.879AA5E_at_informix_dot_com&gt;

Thanx to all the help and advice on my leaking pushrod tubes. New seals, tubes and 
valve gasket and no more obvious leak. Trouble is it still smells bad in the cab.
I cleaned all the accumulated oil grunge off the lower tin but since there are a
few holes in the outside of the heat exchanger I'm guessing that there may be some
old oil that hed leaked into there and burning off - it was real bad on the start of
a 30 mile journey but the wiff of smoke from the front vents had gone after a few
miles, though still smelly at the end.

Is it just old grunge or is the heat exchanger shot? Also, is there a decent 
explaination of how the heater vent flaps and actuators are connected up? My
haynes manual is useless on this point.

Cheers,



Cosmo
