Greetings everyone,
     Since it is so nice and warm this time of year, I thought that I would
start my winter preparations.  I have a 12 volt Stewart Warner gas heater.
It works, but the fuel pump needs to be rebuilt (it does not develop enough
force to draw the fuel into the pump).  Is there any way that I could use a
&quot;modern day&quot; electric fuel pump, or would that cause too many unforeseen
problems/safety issues?  Does anyone know of a source for parts for these
pumps?  What about J.B. heater service?  Anyone got a phone number or
address (and personal experience)?

Hay, lets all get our busses ready for the winter, before it gets cold, then
we won't have to deal with the heater FARTs.

Thanks,
Stuart
