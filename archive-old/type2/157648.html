&gt; Interesting. Do you know if the 2nd generation pertronix that has variable
&gt; dwell is increasing duty cycle at higher rpm?

The dwell of a standard distributor is limited by the need to provide four
firings per distributor revolution and a reasonable amount of &quot;points
closed&quot; closed time to allow the magnetic field to establish itself in the
coil.  You have 90 degrees in which to charge and discharge the coil, but
the amount of dwell you can actually use is limited by the geometry of the
device.

In order to get accurate, repeatable, point opening positions, which are
required for stable timing, you want to have the points open on the &quot;steep
sides&quot; of the cam.  You could increase the dwell to something like 80
degrees, but then the point opening would be on the rounded crest of the
cam and any radial play in the distributor shaft would severely affect
timing.  Your timing would wander all over the place.

Electronic points replacement modules can use more dwell because they
accomplish the switching of the primary current to the coil
electronically.  As soon as the coil discharges they turn the current
without waiting for the distributor cam to rotate and close the points.
