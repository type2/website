Subject: [T2] Using Starter Fluid to find Vacuum Leak

I use the same method to test for vacuum leaks, but with carb cleaner
instead of starting fluid. Since the cleaner is non-flammable you have to
listen for the engine to sputter rather than speed up, but it works like a
champ.

I've never tried starting fluid but I would have the same concerns about
volatility. I take enough trips to the emergency room as it is!
