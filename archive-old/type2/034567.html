Well just had to tell someone about the recipe for busma:
1	Travlin' Kombi
1	bay at home
6pcs.	beer(any brand)
5-8	hours.
Mix kombi and bay thoroughly.  Pour all six beers into batter an beat. 
Allow to stand (or sit) for 5-8 hours.  
Serve.
Feeds many.
Repeat.
Ian Quigley stopped by last night. Left first thing this morning on his
way to Mexico.  The first busser to stop by in the 3 years I've been on
the list!  I guess people don't travel through Mississippi much:). It
was really nice to put a face with the name.  And to hear stories of the
others of you I only know through your signature file.  I even got to
drive a 2.0L for the first time last night(nice job on that engine
BTW).  MAN I gotta get me oneA'those!  

For those of you who haven't met Ian, hope that he plays in a town near
you!  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was great to hang with a fellow
enthusiast.  Him in the middle of a long journey- doing what I actually
spent all this time on my bus for.  Me with a freshly(like litterally 10
miles on) hatched engine.  

I can't wait to work on/drive my bus this weekend!
Thanks for all your help.

Fair winds all
