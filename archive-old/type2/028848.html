&gt; I know that VW used a relay for dual-battery charging
&gt; but I'm going to take a guess and assume it was for
&gt; cost reasons, not performance reasons.  Relays are
&gt; cheap, isolators aren't.  I'm not an EE so I won't
&gt; pretend that I know all the pros and cons.


No, it was for performance reasons.  You need to read the Vanagon list
archives that I posted a link to. The fellow who wrote them - who  _is_ an
EE, and in the battery industry no less - explained that there are in fact
very good reasons for it.  It's cheaper, but it's also safer and more
effective than many elaborate setups.  One of those rare cases where you get
more for less. As a couple of people have mentioned, this is required
reading for anyone considering a dual-battery setup.

Again...
