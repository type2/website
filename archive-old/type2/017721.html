I checked out this 1970 camper w/o a pop top (what is that called?)
Ive got some Q's and you can P-mail me if nec.

1)how long of a job &amp; PITA is it? it has low rust and the quarter panels
to fix.( lower butt cheeks, windsheild bottom and under the drivers left
foot-there are some holes big as yer tip o'finger).

2) what indications does this give me? 
the clutch is sweet, two fingers to shift. Turn it off and on fine.
Although you have to push a button to start it ?? some thing like you
turn the key, push the button starts right up! 44,000 miles?? on a
rebuilt

I think he's asking reasonable $ for it-2900. it comes w/ q-panels,
window seals alll except back windshield, window for drivers side
long jalousie and reupolstry kit fer front two seats. All orig. interior
and looks good.

I posted this cuz I'm learning a great deal and ALL THANX goes out too
you all MAYBE I can help some day...
Untill then I definitely need a few bits o'wisdom
