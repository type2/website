Subject: Re: [T2] Popping out of first

&gt; Howdy!  I'm David Bradley in Atlanta.  Just bought a '72  
&gt; Transporter; just
&gt; joined the list.  I'm trying to figure out why it's begun popping  
&gt; out of
&gt; first gear whenever any serious load is put on it.  I can start off  
&gt; just
&gt; fine, but as soon as the RPMs build, pop goes the weasel!  Any  
&gt; suggestions
&gt; as to what's most likely and where to start looking?  I'd  
&gt; appreciate any
&gt; advice.

First check the transmission fluid level.
