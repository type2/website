&gt; &lt;&lt; I will also put forth the fact that performance car manufacturers such as
&gt; Porsche, Ferrari, Viper (Dodge) and Corvette (GM) equip their cars with wide
&gt; tires.  As with our beloved VW engineers, these guys are not stupid.  They
&gt; know they could save money by putting smaller, narrow tires on their cars.
&gt; The fact that they don't do it speaks volumes for my position.

I've been resisting entering this thread, but whattheheck...

Just about all cars had narrow tires up to the early '60s, including
formula cars, indy cars, and other race vehicles.

What happened to bring in wide tires is that engine and brake technology
suddenly improved markedly.  The stresses imposed on tires by acceleration
and braking loads caused the rubber to be heated to a temperature that
caused it to blister and roll off the tire.  The solution was to spread
the heating over a larger surface to improve heat transfer and keep the
temperatures down.  That's what caused wider tires to be used.

Modern sports cars have wide tires because they have the power and brakes
to easily overheat their tire rubber.  Performance sedans have them
because they look impressive.

Buses?  They don't really need wide tires at all.  If they make you feel
good, go right ahead, but the Porsche folks at the autocross won't have
anything to fear!
