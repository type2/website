Hey Ron! 

Trade out some stuff to a programmer to write a program to read the lists and forums to find out what parts are being discussed. Then it could populate a section of your page with links to the parts. Link back to the list to refer your non-list customers to the best help available. 

Resist the temptation to have the 'bot' reply to the list, &quot;Dude, it'd help if we knew what year and model&quot;. That's Karl's job. 

BTW, your german cv boots are great quality!
