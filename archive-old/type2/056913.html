I have yet to install a Wolfsburg West panel that fit.
I am one of their wholesale dealers, I love the rubber and carpet etc. but
the metal
big frown.

Josh says they are good, I disagree, what pcs have you installed Josh?
maybe you found the one that I havent installed.

I think the WW guys are upfront about it, they tell you it os so-so.
