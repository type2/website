Subject: a slight touch more on leaded gas, and the flywheel definition

About that leaded gas, it is illegal.  Leaded gas is banned, if my
understanding of the law is correct.  I don't say this to be a goody goody
or anything, just that you should take steps to ensure that what you are
buying is really leaded gas, and not gas with some additive which might not
be so healthful for your beloved.  What those steps might be, I dunno, but
I would certainly consider it.

Flywheel system:

The idea is a flywheel ( a wheel with very large mass, much larger than the
flywheel currently in your bus) stores energy.

As it now exists, a high-efficiency gas turbine produces electricity.  This
juice is used to speed up the flywheel(to very, very high rpm) and to turn
electric motors which turn the wheels at cruising speeds.  When you step on
the accelerator, both the turbine and the flywheel generate plenty o' amps
to make the car increase its speed, and this acceleration can be very quick
indeed (Mercedes claims its flywheel system can go 0-60 in 6.0s,
acceleration like this  is way beyond the imagination of any bus owner).

The added advantage of the flywheel is that it recovers energy lost in
braking (a very, very large amount of energy if you think about it).  The
way it works is like this: the drive wheels don't have any brakes.
Instead, when you hit the break, the motors reverse polarity and become
generators, producing electricity which is then stored in, you guessed it,
the flywheel.

Now if a big-ass, high-performance (i.e. low efficiency) Mercedes can get
40 mpg, imagine what a honda civic could get with a flywheel system!

Hope this helps,
Eric
