Subject: [T2] Automotive gel-cell batteries [WAS: battery to choose?Size 24 Battery]

Automotive gel-cell batteries have been available for at least a couple of
years.  The identical units are also sold as &quot;marine&quot; and/or &quot;RV&quot; starting
batteries.  They are claimed to be direct replacements for the original
equipment lead-acid batteries.

The only drawback I can identify is the very high cost of the gel-cell
batteries...

FWIW
