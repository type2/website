True story:  I pulled into the post office parking lot to check my PO box.  I 
parked next to a POS '80's Ford sedan with a sour-looking old guy sitting in 
the passenger seat.  After checking my mail, I came out to find him examining 
a ding (one of many) near the top of his front fender.  He started scowling 
and harrumphing in my general direction, while pointing at his car.  I 
explained politely but in no uncertain terms that I did NOT hit his car with 
my door.  His eyes narrowed, and he hissed back, &quot;yeah, but it was someone 
just like you!&quot;

Happy 2000, Matt Q.  '77 Westy
