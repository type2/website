&gt; sometime when no one is around try stopping that beast at 80mph, while you

&gt; tires....I refuse to drive mine faster than 65max and generally leave more
&gt; space between me and the vehicle in front, 3-4 second spacing minimum.

Well, the majority of vehicles on the road don't have antilock, and most
of them are running on tires less than four years old, even if the vehicle
is 30+ years old.  Yes, you should allow a bit more stopping distance, but
if your brakes are in good shape they should handle an 80-0 stop with
little problem.  Now if you are hot-footing it down a mountain road with
continual braking you might overheat them, but a single stop is well
within their design parameters.

&gt; and for what it is worth, I won't drive behind a roll off tow truck, that
&gt; sharp knife edge of the back end of their truck is at waist level, I just
&gt; have nightmares of hitting one and being sliced in half.........  OK some
&gt; I'm just a little paranoid

No, you just have enlightened self-interest!
