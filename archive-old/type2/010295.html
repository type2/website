I have an oil pump adapter in my 71.  It is really a nice little deal.  Get 
the actual kit though, I have seen some nasty cobble jobs.  The only problem 
I have with mine is that it likes to wiggle the bolts on the trans and on 
the oil pump loose...so just make sure those are tight and you'll have no 
problems...
mine was leaking oil like a mother and I just tightened those up...no I have 
a leak free engine :)

&gt;I suggest you check the archives on the oil pump adapter... mixed issue... 
&gt;I
&gt;don't like it, but it does work.
