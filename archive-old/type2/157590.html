Subject: Re: [T2] What would you do?

I don't think you'll have a problem finding something, Lee.  If you're not in a big hurry, you'll find a body cheap enough that you could have it transported to you.  I mean, if you find a good body for $600, I don't think you'd have to spend $1400 to get it to you even if it was in Maine.  And you should be able to find a good relatively rust-free body somewhere there in Texas.  Just be patient and watch Ebarf and the Samba.  In the mean time, get your engine running correctly and enjoy what you have.  And keep an eye out for Jerry Jess' posts on good Aridzona busses.  JMHO....KR


I've check the Samba for a body or even a running camper, but didn't see 
anything that would work for me.  I'm assuming that it would be fairly 
expensive to tow something from say California or Oregon to Texas.

&gt; Bringing in a rust-free chassis is almost always cheaper than doing 
&gt; major rust repair.  WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED??? The supply of rust-free 
&gt; chassis varies widely by location.
