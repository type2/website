I thought the UK was restrictive, I just read the blue ridge bit explaining
that for the photo shoot a parade permit would have been needed. At some of
the VW shows there are 1000's of VW's not to mention their occupants, did
you see the Ariel photo of the VW Symbol? PARADE PERMIT- What the
HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
