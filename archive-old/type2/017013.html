Hi gang...

FWIW...Pertronics has a problem with the &quot;flame thrower&quot; when used with the
pointless systems, and has a free replacement offer going.

Last spring I installed a compufire in the stock dizzy on my 74 engine, and with
the blue coil, it ran very clean &amp; strong.....but I was given a Pertronics
&quot;Flame thrower&quot;coil for my b-day...and the engine ran worse than points...so I
went back to the blue, and returned the Pertronics coil. A week or so later, I
received another coil &amp; an apology.._dot_defective coils can be recognized by the
threaded studs to connect the wires, but no connectors.....new coil has male
connectors on both sides...otherwise there is no other marking to tell the
difference..so be careful.

Haven't installed the new coil yet, but will when the snow goes away....LOL

Den.

&gt; Yeah I was thinking about getting the &quot;Pertronix Flame Thrower&quot; coil to
&gt; replace my &quot;Blue Coil&quot; when I upgrade to an electronic ignition this spring,
&gt; can I just make the swap without doing anything else?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; &lt;&lt; Hello there!
&gt;
&gt;  I have a 1971 AS engine with generator and original black coil. Can I swap
&gt;  this for a blue coil easily? without any extra wiring bother? and will it
&gt; give
&gt;  any increase in mpg or performance?
&gt;
&gt;  thanks all. adam &gt;&gt;
