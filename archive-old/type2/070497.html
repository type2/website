Subject: Swing lever arm Bushing

My present van got it's name, &quot;Swervy&quot;, from it's bad swing lever arm bushing
when I bought it.  I bought a new bushing for  a relatively small amount but was
surprised by what a big job it turned out to be.  The bushing and the place it
goes have  to be precisely machined and there isn't much room to work with.  I
ended up dropping the front end to do the work..  Before I fixed it I had to
drive with giant oversize snow tires in front so that the gyroscopic forces
would keep the van going relatively straight.    Fixing the Bushing fixed the
problem...
