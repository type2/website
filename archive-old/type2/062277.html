Subject: Odometer and all things Electrical

Hi all,

I'm new to this list and also the proud new owner of a 1966 bus.  This is my first VW 
and I'm learning as I go.  I have two things I want to work immediately.  First, the 
odometer is not working (supposedly just crapped out very recently).  I've been using 
the &quot;Compleat Idiot&quot; manual and just picked up the VW Transporter Owners Workshop Manual 
but neither mention anything about the odometer.  Any advice out there on fixing it?

The other question(s) I have relate to the electrical system.  The previous owner 
converted to 12V but I don't believe that he did a very good job.  Currently the good 
news is: the bus starts (yeah!) and the headlights and brakelights work.  The bad news: 
the red and green warning lights aren't working, the fuel gauge isn't working (there is 
a 6V to 12V conversion kit waiting to be installed), the horn doesn't work, the turn 
signals are not hooked up (as there is no turn signal switch installed yet), and the 
driver's side headlight goes on when the brakes are applied.  Oh, I almost forgot, when 
the headlights are on and the bus is turned off, the engine continues to run until the 
headlights are turned off.  I believe there must be some grounding problems with 
unconnected wires sloppily taped up.  Before I start sorting out this mess, I wondered 
if anyone had some advice on how to approach this confusion?
