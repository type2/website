&gt; so I don't lose to much of the reliability factor but am looking for any
&gt; suggestions I could get. If anyone has other ideas for me feel free to throw
&gt; them my way I could use them.

Dave,
check out the bone stock 2.0L type IV engine that I'm putting into my '60 double
cab at
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/typeIV.html  then follow the links at the bottom of my
page to Joe Cali's Next Generation site and other type IV sites.  No
modifications or cutting of body required.  I had the engine in there for sizing
last weekend and it slid right in.
Pictures of this are at http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/cis-fi.html
