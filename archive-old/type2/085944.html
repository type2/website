Subject: Re: [T2] Still having problems with clutch install...



Sean,
     The only thing left is the pilot bearing.  If the transmission doesn't 
mate up with the pilot bearing, you will have these symptoms.  Having the 
car in gear, and turning a wheel while mating the engine and tranny seems to 
do the trick.

     Eron
&gt;
&gt;Am I missing something here when I mate the tranny and motor back up? It
&gt;seems like the shaft isn't coming together with the clutch disc correctly.
&gt;The throwout bearing is brand new and installed according to Bentley
&gt;yesterday -- looked okay today while I had it all apart. Also, the shaft
&gt;looks fine -- no visible damage, anyways.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? I need to get this done today since this is my daily driver, so
&gt;quick replies are verrry welcome!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Sean
&gt;
