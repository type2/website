Subject: Re: [T2] replacement tin screws

Keep in mind that Stainless Steel doesn't mean no corrosion.  In fact, in
contact with some metals stainless can even promote corrosion!  I'm not
sure about the head material, but the captive nuts in the tin should be
OK.  In any case, a smidge of antisieze would be a good idea even with SS.
