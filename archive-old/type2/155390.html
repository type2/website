Did you do this check cylinder #1?

Since the piston comes to the top twice you have to check the valves to see if they are both closed (about to start the power stroke).

&gt;and if i were to put the
&gt;drive gear in at the proper 12 degrees to the case line, the rotor will
&gt;still not line up with the notch on the distributor if the notch is
&gt;postioned correctly at 4:00.  is it possible that the distributor was taken
&gt;apart and  put together wrong too?

If it's 180 degrees out, then the drive gear at the bottom can have been assembled backwards. It's it's some other amount, no.

Also, if you have a beetle dizzy the mark on the distributor body will not be in the right spot for a Type 4 engine.

&gt;is it even nessesacry that the dirive
&gt;gear be put in exactly that way.

If you want to rely on the rotor to indicate TDC you should assembly all the parts properly.

&gt;i dunno if i should or  shouldn't?

The engine runs better with the vacuum can but it will still run 85% (plucked from the air) as well without it.
