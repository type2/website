Subject: Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

I have a `71 westfalia I just picked up.  It is a beater but none the less useable for camping.
 
The brakse are all shot.  Seems quite costly replacing all the brake components for this vehicle and i wonder if my servo is any good?
 
My question is there a way to eliminate using the power brake servo, Maybe be using the earlier 68-70 master cylinder ?  Will this work with the front disc brakes?  Any ideas helpful hints on this subject or for doing the brakes on this vehicle cheaply as possible?
 
thanks
