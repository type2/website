&gt;when you get to boone there are several places you can camp...although i'd
&gt;just park somewhere overnight on the parkway...it's usually okay and i've
&gt;never been hassled by the park service. there's a great, cheap breakfast
&gt;place in boone, can't remember the name but will get it for you. that is a
&gt;must! take time to look in the shops...some neat stuff up there.

You should know that this is technically not allowed.  I've never been
hassled around Asheville, but upon waking once in Va on the pkwy an officer
informed us that parking on the pkwy was not allowed.  She was very nice
tho, as all pkwy cops tend to be.  A better option is to pull off on one of
the side roads you'll find along the way.

Have a nice trip!  Asheville is the best place I've found on the planet.

Eric
