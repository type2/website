&gt;Hello list,
&gt;Since I am about to purchase a oil temp gauge, I was wondering which one was
&gt;better, the drain plate sensor or the dipstick sensor.  I was hoping they were
&gt;bothe the same because the drain plate is so much cheaper.
&gt;Also, with all this contreversy over webers,  what about solex carbs?  are
&gt;they any better?  will they even fit on a bus.  I am running a progressive
&gt;right now and don't care for it to much.

This was *just* rehashed on this list (for the tenth time, at least) a week
or two ago.  I am tired of addressing this question so please check the
list archives.
