Subject: battery dead, won't hold charge

Hi everyone,
I hope someone can help.
3 days ago my speakers stopped working.
2 days ago my bus wouldn't start. maybe I left my stereo on. maybe cause it 
rained real hard the night before.
yesterday I try jumping it with 2 different cars and nothing happens. When 
the jumper cables are hooked up I should be feeding off of their battery, 
right? I at least should be able to turn on an overhead light or the warning 
lights should come on or something, right? But I get nothing.
So today I call AAA. They send someone out to jump me. He is successful 
using one of those boxes with the two cables so you don't need another car 
to get a jump. I let it run for 25 minutes. Turn it off and try to start it 
again. Lights work. trys to turn over, but not enough juice to start it. try 
again. warning lights fade and doesn't even try to start. try again. not 
even warning lights.
Any advice is greatly appreciated. Not only is this my daily driver, but I'm 
also living in it. and last night I got a ticket for being illegally parked.
thanks,
Kyle
