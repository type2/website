Subject: [T2] What keeps rear axle from sliding?

I am in the middle of doing my rear brakes and CV's and I noticed that my
right axle moves in and out freely while my left axle has only millimeters
of play. What is the mechanism to keep the axle from sliding in and out
(besides having the wheel attached) ?
