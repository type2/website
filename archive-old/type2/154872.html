Subject: RE: [T2] best rubber for sliding window on my 78

&gt; Hey guys, what are the WCM issues? I have a bus
&gt; full of it via Bus Depot as I recall and am wondering
&gt; if I could do better next time. Noticed one of the rear
&gt; side windows has a seal that is dying 7 yrs later 
&gt; outside 100% of the time. Everything else looks okay
&gt; and seals fine.



Are you sure it is WCM? We did ship some WCM seals 7 years ago, but even
then most of it was not WCM (unless someone specifically ordered the WCM
version from our site). These days we ship virtually no WCM seals at all;
virtually all of our rubber is European made and/or genuine VW.  Just wanted
to clarify that here.  Not that we had any problems with the WCM seals
(sounds like yours are holding up pretty well, in fact).  But as we grew and
started importing containers directly from Europe, we found we could get
better quality for less money on the &quot;other side of the pond.&quot;
