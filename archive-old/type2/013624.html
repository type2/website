&gt; Greetings. Can anyone out there in list land give me a clue as to what 
&gt; the
&gt; flat rate time would be for replacing all the ball joints on a ' 78 
&gt; Westy?
&gt; Just labor, not parts.

well, I paid ~$300 for them to replace all 4 ball joints on my '71 Westy 
and
IIRC, parts were around $60-80 (that's a guess), so ~$200-250 I would
expect (if nothing major has changed between 71 and 78 ball joints).

That's at least ballpark.
