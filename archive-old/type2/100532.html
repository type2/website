Subject: Re: [T2] Recharging Gel Cell Batteries (General Battery
  Question)

    I have a general battery question that I haven't seen on any of the 
FAQ's or anything yet. This may sound ignorant, but how does the voltage and 
amperage relate to charging batteries?  Does the voltage just kind of 
determine which whay the current flows, and the amperage determine how fast? 
  That would seem to be what it looks like when I look at information on 
charging batteries, since you have to have more voltage on the charger that 
at the battery, and the higher the amperage the faster it charges the 
battery?  So (Time for some very crude ascii):

                    Current Flow -&gt;
     _             _           _             _
  |-| |-----------| |-|     |-| |-----------| |-|
  |  Charged Battery  |     |   Dead Battery    |
  |  (12+ volts)      |     |  (less than 12V)  |
  |                   |     |                   |
  |                   |     |                   |
  ---------------------     ---------------------

     And then, the more amps you give it, the faster the current flows from 
one battery (or place in the case of alternators and chargers) to the other 
battery?  I guess I just don't understand how the voltage and amperage 
relate, and how that determines which battery is charged and how fast.

Thanks,
