Upright aircoolers:

I posted a while back about my virgin rebuilding experience - the 
mongrel engine in my '71 westy.  I wanted to give an update.  
Executive Summary: I gave up.

When last we spoke, I had it back together and had test-run it 
twice, for a total of about 30-40 minutes.  I wrote of my concern 
that the engine was getting tighter after each run, though - getting 
to where it would hardly turn over -- even with a crescent wrench on 
the crank pulley nut.  Uncool.

It was not end-play.  I got it down to the long block - still stiffer than-
-well, *stiff* - and called Curt at Radical Car Care (&quot;Car Care for the 
Cognizant&quot;) here in Tallahassee.  I plug the man because he has 
been very laid back and helpful in my ignorance.

Curt agrees to take the whole thing off my hands and give it back 
to me, running, for some dollars.  As this is like Emeril agreeing to 
rescue that souffle you just toasted, I'm tickled.

He tears into it and calls me a day or so later.  &quot;You know, I hate 
to ask people this, but did you have oil in this engine when it fired 
up?&quot;  I did -- I was so paranoid about not doing so that I had several 
dry-motor nightmares while the thing was apart.

He gets further into it and calls back.  #3 crank bearing had siezed, 
but the crank is usable.  Cam is toast on the rear lobes, as are the 
corresponding followers.  Like no oil.  Scuffing on a couple of 
pistons.  &quot;Did you use any assembly lube on this?&quot; he asks.  Boy 
did I.  That stuff should be sold in sex shops.

Curt's still scratching his head, wondering how a cam could wear 
through the case hardening so fast.  &quot;Bad cam, maybe?&quot;  At the 
FLAPS (Eastern Imports - again a plug 'cause they do me good), 
they decide it's not but give me a break on a replacement.

Then I get a phone message last Saturday.  Curt says I had a one-
year-only oil pump that didn't quite match up with my case.  Not 
surprising that I missed that, really - the case has no numbers &amp; 
has been only tentatively identified as a '70 or '71.  &quot;Pump probably 
cavitated - couldn't suck enough oil - and although you had enough 
pressure to kill the idiot light, it wasn't enough to lubricate.&quot;

Well, that's the current theory.  If I sound calm, it's partly because 
this whole rebuilding job has been so temporally attentuated that 
it's hard to generate a head of emotional steam over it.  And I've 
learned something.  And I'm still about $1.98 ahead of where I'd 
have been if I'd bought a longblock and never knew what the inside 
of my engine looked like.

Hope it goes better next time.

Will report further as events warrant....
