Subject: servo line to dual ICTs

living in the ozark hills, i finally decided to put the ICTs from my 66 on 
my 71 Westy to help in the inclines..i didn't before because i had some 
reservations about the servo line to the manifold....should i drill and tap 
the left manifold for the servo line for a brass fitting...will the smaller 
&quot;equalizer&quot; line between the manifolds compensate allright for both? another 
reason i kept the stock carb was i didn't want to cut out the air cleaner 
mount, but it looks like it is held in by rivets that can be just drilled 
out (and riveted back in if wanted)...i was going to run two old bug oil 
bath cleaners on the ICTs because paper ones suck living down a 20 mile dirt 
road...anyone tried this?
