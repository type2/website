Subject: Yukon's great &quot;I (nearly) don't know diddley&quot; '69 sunroof project

Hi - first timer here.
I've had a string of  VWs some air-cooled, some water but for several years
I strayed to other  camps - lured by convenience and the promise of
reliability that could master my own ignorance.  I have returned with a new
determination to learn and be self sufficient by bringing a new-to-me '69
sunroof back to life.  I have a few questions to start off with.

Could the 1600 upright engine in this bus have been transplanted from a
Porsche 914 like the seller implied?  It strikes me that 914s all had the
Type IV.

Does anyone know of  a sunroof bus being parted out?  My bus came to me with
the sunroof out and it is missing various brackets and hardware.

Aside from bringing her back up to snuff mechanically there are a couple of
changes I'd like to make.  I plan to switch from a generator to an
alternator and perhaps to a two battery system - these changes for the
purpose of being able to run a swamp cooler (I'm moving to Phoenix next
year) and maybe (is this a crazy idea?) heated seats swapped out of a junked
Audi 5000 or some such car since I'll be moving to Montana in two years.
While either of these might not require such a beefed up electrical system
I'm also expecting to install  fog and driving lights somewhere along the
way (I typically drive a lot of unlit mountain roads).

I should be getting a six pack of POR15 in the mail tomorrow to paint the
bottom of my bus.  The driver's side has the pan almost entireely rusted
away should I just remove the other which is mostly intact and then simply
paint the bottom of the floor panel.  Does anyone have a strong feeling
about the necessity of the pans?

Thanks for your time.
