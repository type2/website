&gt; Yes, you really should be very careful driving it on 1-1-2000 and not to
&gt; forget 29-2-2000 (2000 is a leap year although many people think not!). Also
&gt; you have to take into account that since the ECM was probably made in

&gt; problems on new-years eve.

I was amazed that by resetting the ECM internal clock to Greenwich Mean
Time +2 I was able to increase MPG from 22 to 35, and top speed from 70
to 93!!!!
