Hello all,

    My name is Charles and im a vw addict! I have owned 3 vws first two were
bugs 65' &amp; 59'
my last one (probably not my last) I just got a 63' panel  bus. It is in
half way good shape i paid 400.00 for it (that is why i have it, it was a
good deal) it runs i received no keys with it, the back door was locked and
the engine was lock with no handle(and the lock was broke could not get the
door open i did though i need some new hinges anyone!) there is some rust
through out the whole thing nothing to bad though. might have to replace by
feet though! i live in California, Dublin that is.
there is a show in Vallejo this weekend i believe, just a reminder. back to
the bus - i want to lower it ( i know a lot of you hate lowered buses i
think it looks better dragging up drive ways!) Here are a few things if you
know about them let me here from you.

(1) Lowering -  i did a friends bus a few years ago but cant remember if he
had reduction boxes or not - also the front end i don't want to take out the
springs this time what do you suggest

(2) rust - it will probable be a while before i get to the rust but some of
the rain rails are bad.

That is about it for now hope i can help anyone with the knowledge that i
have it has been awhile since my brain has been on vws but it still has
something's in it .
