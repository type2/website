congratulations

&gt; The car is in very good condition, well etleast the body of the car.

that is excellent, where are you located??  if bus has been in the North
where there is snow I would be very surprised with no rust at all.

&gt; Now over to the not so good things about my bus:
&gt;=20
&gt; First of all is the cables, they are old(very old) and the are just a mes=

I assume you are talking electrical cables,  there are mechanical cables
such as clutch/accelerator/heater/vents

&gt; And some of them are not working as well, so I guess I have to replace al=
l=20
&gt; the cables to new ones and maybe some other electrical stuff. The old own=
er=20
&gt; has started the job but got stuck so he just left it in a complete mess.

OUCH!   first thing, get good electrical diagram for your bus, Bentley
manual has some good ones but I think they are mostly for American buses.

&gt; And now I wonder how hard it is to replace all the cables for a beginner,=
=20
&gt; how much it costs and if you need a lot of speciall tools for the job?

it takes slow careful work, but not very hard. it very time consuming but
actual cost is not a lot. a few tools would be needed such as

VOM meter
soldering iron
good screw drivers
GOOD quality wire crimping tool and crimps of various sizes


&gt; The second thing is the engine, the problem there is that it=B4s out of t=
he=20
&gt; car and I have to get the engine home to my place and then install it in =
the=20
&gt; car. Now remember that I am a beginner in vw-busses and I have no ide=E1 =
of=20
&gt; how I should do to get the engine back into the car.

get the Bentley manual for your bus it has complete step by step
instructions

&gt; So what do you think? Am I just a complete fool that takes a car home tha=
t=20

if you are happy then you are not a fool.  you will think so some days but
hang in there it is worth the work

&gt; doesn=B4t even work or are these problems easy to fix even for a beginner=
?

??? good question, is this the first time you have ever worked on any
vehicle, or do you have experience on other cars?
are you handy with tools or can't find the right end of a hammer??

it depends on what you start with. if you have never even looked under
your family car, you will  need to buy many tools and gain much
experience, if you are a handy person you may have the tools you need and
pretty good idea of &quot;how things work&quot; you probably will not have a lot of
problems

&gt; So now I am in a situation where I need all(and I mean all) the informati=
on=20
&gt; I can get.
&gt; I hope you all understand my questions and I am sorry for my poor englich=
=2E

no problems with the English,  =20
one thing you will need is some good manuals and books, get the Bentley
manual,  Check to see if there are VW manuals in your language that will
make it easier, but get the Bentley also this is the offical service
manual.

there are a number of bus parts companies on the list so they can help
with parts.   I also think there are some other members in your part of
the world so they could also be a lot of help in finding things locally

good luck
