Question:  Has the Blue locktite ever given any problems in getting the
gland nut off?  The last time I removed a gland nut was from a mystery
motor and it required me jumping on the end of a 6-foot cheater and
application of my entire blue vocabulary.  I suspect that this one was due
to loktite.

I put on a new gland nut (didn't trust the old one that required nearly
1000 ft-lbs to remove) and used anti-sieze on the threads.  Torqued to 260
ft-lbs.  it stayed tight for another 15000 miles until another
cause prompted me to replace the engine.
