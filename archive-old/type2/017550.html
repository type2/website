&gt; Couldn't find this in the archives, so i figured i'd ask...
&gt; Just got a 74' that has been sitting with -some- gas in the tank with the cap on and everything sealed for about 3, maybe 4 years.  Needless to say, the carb was all gummed up and when i pulled the line off the tank, the gas was all dark and smelly like it gets when it breaks down.
&gt; First of all, i know i should pull the tank to have it dipped and probably will later.  For right now, a friend told me deisel fuel is a pretty good solvent for getting that old gas out. Cuss/discuss?
&gt; TIA,

Clark:
Sorry, diesel fuel will NOT dissolve varnished gasoline. Lacquer thinner
will, as will a host of other aromatic solvents: probably Methanol, MEK,
Toluol, etc.
Disposal of the dregs is an evironmental nightmare. I'd be tempted to
pour in a couple of gallons of new gas (gasohol would be MUCH better),
maybe a gallon of methanol, and just drive it away! Next best idea is:
remove tank, slosh it around with solvent in it, pour it out on sand or
gravel drive, get the tank a long way away, light it with a match. 
WHOOMP!! (if it's volatile) At least this keeps it out of streams and
rivers. Be real careful around this mix, but at least you'll be
expecting a fire, so it's easier to control its time and location!
By the way, it looks like 75 was the end of the removeable filter. 76
and later are just pickup tubes sweated in.
