Subject: Which set of gaskets?

I hope you folks aren't tiring of my &quot;newbie questions&quot; already. I'm at BUS 
DEPOT site trying to order the proper oil gaskets/strainer kits for the new 
1600 mexican VW engine I just had installed. Ther doesn't appear to be a way 
to ask them on a question on line, they just offer a link back to type 2. Who 
can tell me if I need a .. 
1.Gasket set/oil strainer 1200-1600CC (5 sets of gaskets of gaskets/ crush 
washers) $2.95
2.Oil strainer/gasket kit 1200 -1600      65 cents each.

I'll be doing frequent oil changes at first and I want to order a supply.
