Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Westy donor to '79 Kombi sunroof

Hi Folks,

Even though I'm content with my 1979 poptop Westy, I'd recommend keeping a 
poptop away from your 1979 Kombi.  After 1974, Westfalia Werke used standard 
buses and cut most of the top away to make room for the upstairs bed.  You 
could adapt a pre-74 poptop, but those are only designed to have a small cot 
underneath them.

I would recommend putting most of the &quot;downstairs&quot; Westy stuff in -- Z-bed, 
side cabinets, etc.  That way you can still open the roof and enjoy the 
starry sky while you're camping!

Good Luck!
