Chip,
shop around for that windshield. I have paid as little as $75  for the flat
windshield in a '72 Super, the same glass shop sold me a new Bay window for my
'72 Westy for $102.31($97.90 for the glass and installation, $4.41 sales tax),
tinted, no less, for cars with Air Conditioning. Granted, this was in Jan. of
'93, but prices can't have changed that much. If it's any help, the shop is
located in Suffolk, VA (near Virginia Beach), 420 E. Pinner St., phone is (806)
934-2148. I have no affiliation with this company, except for the fact that I
was very pleased with the work and the price. It was right around the corner
from my house, too.
Good Luck!

Form follows function. Why else would wheels be round?
