Subject: Re: [T2] Bilge blower Conversion Questions (&amp; I _did_ surf the 
  T2  Archive!!!)

From: &lt;ARoman4047_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Did that on a '71...Mounted a three speed blower in the tire well and blew
the cabin air through the heat exchangers. The engine fan was only for
engine cooling (capped at the doghouse). Very warm ...

I figured that adding an insulated lid to the tire well would deaden the
sound of the blower, and that I can run the air inlet from the well to the
birch AA plywood divider that I added that extends the angle of the fuel
tank compartment wall up to the level of the bottom of the windows.

I did this so that I could place my tools over the engine compartment
without the tools becoming deadly projectiles during a sudden stop.  Later,
I'll add a retractable cover that lifts out of the way when you open the
back door.

Exactly how big is one of these blowers?  Did it fit in the tire well
without sticking out above the top of the well?

Thanks for the help, Tony.
