Hi again

For the cooker you may want to try http://www.volksheaven.co_dot_uk/, its 
advertised as the biggest breakers yard for ACVW in the UK and its only 9 
miles away from me. If he has a cooker ask for a price.

Unfortunatley prices of used spares in the UK have gone up IMHO so you may 
be in for a shock, and then as you mention theres the exchange rate.

&gt;Yes shipping may be a problem
&gt;but all I need are the stove innerds. (Sorry North Dakota term). Another 
&gt;problem
&gt;is the currency exchange rate!!! Amazing what the difference is.
