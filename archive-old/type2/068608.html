Subject: changing oil screen

I am very new at this, so hopefully you all won't find this too 
elementary to respond to.  I just bought a '67 bus a few weeks ago and 
noticed that the oil light flickered on when I started the motor.  I 
checked the oil and found that it was full (a little over full actually) 
but pretty dirty.  Today I decided to change the oil.  After removing the 
oil drain bolt and the oil fill cap, the oil just dripped out of the 
drain like mollasses.  I decided to take out the plate that covers the 
oil screen, thinking the screen might have been really clogged up.  Upon 
removing the plate, a bizarre air-filter like apparatus with a bearing (?!) and 
spring fell out.  This didn't look anything like the oil screen I had 
bought at BAP, so I took both back to the store.  They said that what I 
pulled out of the motor was garbage, and the weird, apparantly home made 
oil filter was probably restricting oil flow and causing the oil light 
flickering.  Feeling re-assured, I chucked the old filter-thing and went 
home to put on the new one.  Unfortunately, the new screen would not 
easily push into place.  I'm guessing that the hole in the center of the 
screen is suppossed to be pushed onto the pipe in the motor, but it just 
doesn't seem like it wants to go.  I tried hammering on it but I ended up 
distorting the filter without really squeezing it into place.  Tommorrow 
morning I'm going to buy a second filter, but before I bash it up again, 
could anyone give me any hints about how to make this go more smoothly?  
If this question seems too elementary to answer on the list, I'd sure 
appreciate a personal reply.

Thanks,

Matthew F.
