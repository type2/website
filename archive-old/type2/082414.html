&gt; don't know what you did, but works fine, thanks

Learned to use my carraige return :-)

&gt; &gt; line later I had adapted the gauge to fit the ring main=20
&gt; terminal.  So I run
&gt; &gt; the starter and the gauge reads zero.  When I remove the=20
&gt; gauge and run the

&gt; hmmmmm, try putting a bike air pump on it and see if it even works??

Shot 15 psi into it from my compressor and it registered correctly.

&gt; something is screwy here, I would=20
&gt;=20
&gt; . check to be sure guage works
&gt; . check to make sure you have a FI pump, sort of looks like a=20
&gt; coil in size

Hmm, smaller (diameter) than a coil fersure, heres a picture=20

&gt; . check the actual presure able to be pumped by plugging the=20
&gt; line by the
&gt; regulator.  don't let it get too high, but at least 30-40psi should be
&gt; able to be pumped pretty quickly

I'll do this next.  OK, if I understand correctly, the pump puts out
way more than 35 psi but the regulator keeps it at ~35psi?

Thanks,
