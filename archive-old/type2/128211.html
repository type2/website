Subject: Heats up and dies

Although I have a bus in the restoration phase, to get
around I had to get that other less popular VW with
little character called a bug.  It has a good engine
that hasn't run much in the past year, but it was
either that or a Ford Escort! 

Now I have a problem with it.  First if there is
another site out there that has made the feeble
attempt to copy this success of this site, point me in
that direction and I'll trouble you no more.  Until
then the problem I have is this.  Starting off cold, I
drive about 4-5 miles and it stalls and won't restart
until cool.  I have removed and cleaned the tank, put
in an electric fuel pump, new coil and air in the
tires with no change.  Next is to change out the
automatic choke and see if that helps.  Any
suggestions would be appreciated.

Tks

Stan
