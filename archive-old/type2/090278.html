&gt; Heading up 395 for some hiking/camping this weekend. Anybody know any good vw yards/things to see/people to meet from Ridgecrest north?

&gt; We're coming from the central valley over a mountain pass north of the 58. Is it the 178?

Probably too late, but there is a good VW place in Bishop.  Never had any
work done there, but the owner helped me out when I was in need of a tire
to get me to Reno.  It's called &quot;Sierra German Auto&quot; and it's on the north
side of town on the way to Mammoth, past the &quot;Y&quot;.  There are a lot of bugs
and buses parked outside
