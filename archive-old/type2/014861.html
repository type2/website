&lt;&lt; I have EXACTLY these symptoms with my bus, and they did not go away
 after installing BRAND NEW carbs (dual pdsit).  The problem is not
 nearly as bad now the weather is warmer. &gt;&gt;

i should have clarified myself.....it is on a 71 bus with a 74 1600 upright in
it.  the 1600 motor came out of a friends wrecked lower mileage super
beetle...so i put it in my 71.  the carb in question is a single 34 pict 3 NOT
duals.  sorry about that.
