Subject: Fan Shroud Flaps and the HE Covers

Hello all. I am reassembling my engine (2.0L) and I have a few questions 
about the little &quot;tin flaps&quot; at the bottom ports of the Fan shroud. They are 
at the ports where the Heat Exchangers tie into the Fan Shroud. At this same 
place there are two &quot;U Shaped&quot; pieces of tin that cover this area and are 
attached to the Heat Exchangers by two screws each. I have a set of the 
little flaps but they are mangled like foil wrappers from a fast food joint. 
The covers I don't have a single one never seen on either.

My Questions are:

How important are either the flaps or the covers?
Does anybody have any extras laying around?
How hard would it be to install them after the fact?
I could probably duplicate the little flaps and possibly the covers(if I had 
Pics of the covers). I am putting this thing together ASAP so I would need 
them soon unless either part is not really needed.

Thanks,
Michael Knight
