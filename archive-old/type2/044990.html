Subject: [T2] Pulling a 2000 out of a 79

Things are going well for the most part and I should pickup my shiny new
long block on Friday!!!
A couple of questions though: The trusty Bentley has the following as
step 4 of engine removal:

On cars with fuel injection, disconnect the injection system wiring
harness from the coil, the injectors, the intake air distributor, the
crankcase, the tempature sensors, and the intake air distributor and its
related parts.

Well beside the fact that the intake air distributor is mentioned twice,
the fuel injection section notes the following: Normally, you will need
to remove the intake air distributor only when you are preparing to
desassemble the crankcase with the engine removed from the car.

Do I need to remove the intake air distributor to pull the engine - it
seems as though I do not???

The upper engine to trany mounting bolts - are these 15mm??
 I am used to the 1600 dual port of a 71 where all four bolts were 17mm

The pressure regulator and fuel line through the fire wall - the Bentley
says right front - it looks to me to be left front or maybe I am not
remembering what is right and left -- from facing the back or facing the front??

Finally, what have people out there used to support the trany?? Can you
use a floor jack and a 2X12?

Thanks in advance!! I really do appreciate your help!!
