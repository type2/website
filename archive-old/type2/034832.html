Subject: not a bus, it's a trailer

Has anyone tried this:  My 71 parts bus (got to give this away soon) has
no engine or trans, I have clean current non-op registration in CA.  I
cannot put it on the street because no engine = it gets towed and
snatched by the city tow company.   So can I go down to the DMV and get
it registered as a homemade trailer?  This would still only be shortterm
so I don't want to go through too many hoops, it will let me keep it the
weekend without it being towed.  They won't give this info out on the
phones.  I believe it is a matter of filling out some forms and bringing
it by for a safety inspection.  Problem may be the use of a bolt-on
towbar does not qualify it as a bonafide trailer and they may consider
it a scam.  But if I actually weld on the bar, or what does anybody
think about this?  It actually makes a hell of a good four wheel one-ton
capacity trailer (fantasy is to make a westfalia camper trailer!) except
you can't back it up (just like microsoft, hah).  But then it has a
steering wheel and e-brake and is so nice and solid.  The goal is to get
current reg tags so it can go into a storage lot that will not accept
out-of-reg cars or trailers.  International and out of California folks,
please be brief, if you know about this in CA I will be very grateful.
Administator:This is a short term request thread, please cut this out of
circulation in two or three days.  Thanks.  really hope I get instant
feedback today so I can go the the DMV before the weekend (Today is
Friday the 14th, must be our lucky day)
