Subject: 79 FI won't start (easily) continues

I agree about the cold start system, the slow start
could be the lack of fuel on the cranking when the
cold start is supposed to work.. One way to check is
to squirt some gas into the manifold and see if it
starts easy, if it does start easy then check
everything on the cold start system to make sure it is
working right. Phil
