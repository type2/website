Subject: Re: Voltage Regulator

Alan,
It sounds like you are looking at the battery isolator.  I also own a 78 
Riviera and my voltage regulator is next to the isolator.  The voltage 
regulator is a silver box held to the engine compartment by two screws.  I am 
new to bus world, so I too am not sure about exactly where your wires 
connect.  I have four connections.  I have two batteries. The auxiliary 
battery connects on the left and the battery that powers the starter connects 
on the right.  I am still learning as well.  I hope this helps and good luck!

Mike
