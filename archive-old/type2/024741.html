Greetings to the List,

Has anybody here done any business with Z Products, a company based in 
Wilsonville, Oregon?  They are a VW camper conversion company.  

I'm interested in one of their products.  On their website 
(http://www.zproducts_dot_com/vwvancamper.cfm?cid=771) they feature a Z-bed 
conversion kit.  It allows your stock third seat to fold into a regular Z-bed 
configuration.  While down as a seat it looks absolutely stock.

Anybody have any experience with the company or their products?

TIA,

Mike
