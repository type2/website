Lots of liquid wrench!  Apply it repeatedly for a few days before you
pull the thing apart.

When you're ready to take it apart, get a drift and put it on the top
of the screw.  Give it a few sharp raps with a hammer, which helps to
break things loose.

Once you get the things apart, be sure to use anti-sieze to prevent
future problems.  You will probably end up taking it apart again!
