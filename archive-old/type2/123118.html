&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; This is an odd question.  I know there is tin to put in a type 1 engine 
&gt; into a late bus.  Is it possible to mate an automatic transmission to the 
&gt; type 1?  I understand a 1600 is underpowered, but I have a torque monster 
&gt; 1904cc in my '71 now. Thanks.

nope the torque converter will not fit....on the type I engine,  type I
engines use the single large bolt to hold the flywhieel on, the type IV
and the automatic used the 5 bolt around the edge to hold it onto the
crankshaft...  to get it to work would require more work than it would be
worth....if you want automatic, get a type IV engine
