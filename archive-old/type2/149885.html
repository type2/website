&gt; Behave!  We all know that you want to burn really bad.  Last year I
&gt; missed Jerome because of Burning Man.  This year I'm heading up the VW
&gt; Bus Camp at Burning Man and you folks need to think about joining us.
&gt; www.vwbuscamp_dot_com.  Join the list.  The info address is wrong.  Just
&gt; join the list....  Gary Gibson

    Just got back into town from a short trip so I'm a little tardy in
responding to the feedback on BM.

     However,  I was recently talking to some folks who attend BM regularly,
&amp; mentioned I was planning on hanging w/a  VW bus group.  They responded
that last year there were about 35,000 folks at BM  &amp; that about half of
them were in VW buses! That would make BM the largest bus show in the
world????

Tom-looking forward to parallel universes-split windows &amp; vanagons?
