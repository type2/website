Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder base spacers

I am in mid rebuild as well but have not got to the stage of measuring 
deck height so I don't know which I need.

I did get 4 X .010 spacers in the gasket kit from the busdepot, however. 
I would ship 'em to you but I may need them myself.  I will know after 
the weekend.

Aircooled_dot_net has them listed but for $20 each !! i.e $80/set

EMPI lists them in their catalogue, this place seems to have them 
www.doghouserepair_dot_com but any VW flaps probably carries EMPI and can 
get them.

Shame if Ron is out of them; what about other thicknesses including the 
.060?

I'll email you if I find they are not needed after the weekend; hope it 
won't be too late.
