Subject: Re: [T2] Gettin' ready for a TRIP

&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any recommendations for stops/things
to do/places to see/people to meet?&lt;&lt;

Chris,

it has been many years since i traveled down that road &amp; memory is
very hazy. but what i do remember of the Natchez Trace is that
there is _nothing_ for miles!

that was a long time ago so there might be more going on out
there now.

&amp; yes, some very interesting history!

good luck,

Joel Wilson
