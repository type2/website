&gt; I looked on the website and DL'd the catalog and I dont see a stainless
&gt;  bus muffler for an upright. Maybe its too new? I think Ill include myself
&gt;  with the many (im sure) who would be interested.

As the original poster said, these items are not on the web site but have 
appeared in the VW Heritage adverts in Volksworld.

Contrary to another post these SS exhausts are definitely for 1600 busses 
(but yes they do do another one for Beetles). Also unlike the SS exhaust 
boxes which have been on sale in the UK for many years the pictures in the VW 
Heritage advert show them to be visually identical to the standard mild steel 
exhausts. 
Unlike the SS exhausts available from Autocavan these do have the little heat 
exchangers on the #2 and #4 pipes fitted  and are approx. 50% cheeper!

Good luck
