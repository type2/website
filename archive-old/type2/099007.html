Subject: Autostick Beetle Parts

I know that this is mainly for type 2's but I also know there are beetle 
owners out there.
I have numerous autostick transmission parts for sale.  I have several 
control valves for the servo, an entire wiring harness for the autostick 
along with several switches.  I also have all the hoses and tanks from a 70 
autostick beetle.  I also have a rebuilt clutch servo with a brand new 
diaphragm and a shifter with working contact points.
Make me an offer.
I also have pop out windows for the 65-77 beetle.  Make an offer.  These are 
getting hard to find.
I also have several Stewart Warner gas heaters for both buses and beetles, 6 
volt and 12 volt.
Let me know off the list.
Regards,
Al
