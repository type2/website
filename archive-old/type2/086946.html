&gt; Hi guys, 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Still worried about oil pressure though. Took it out for a 12 mile run
&gt; &gt;&gt; to try to get it broke in this evning. As long as I hit all 4 gears when
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I'm running 5-50 synthetic (very thin) in my rebuilt 2 liter after about
&gt; &gt;15k it is still pumping 65psi at startup and at idle and running at 230F
&gt; &gt;it will still be holding 30psi
&gt; 
&gt; 230F is pretty warm isn't it?

right that would be 60-70mph on a 90+F day

&gt; I'm interested, because my engine seems to be on the edge of the red on long trips, even in temperate weather at speeds between 60 &amp; 70mph, at around 3600rpm.

I start slowing down at 230degrees and pull over at 250

&gt; I have noticed that the gearbox crunches in 1st when she's very cold though.
&gt; 
&gt; Any hints there? 

don't have that problem, but I have an auto tranny  ;8*}
