Subject: RE: [T2] New MicroBus [and the Wall Street Journal]

&gt;&gt;I'd like to see the WSJ do an in-depth report about the
 VW0A trademark/copyright mess, how it is affecting
 VW-related businesses, owners of older VW vehicles, etc., etc., etc.&lt;&lt;

i agree 100%. unfortunately i don't think we will ever see such an article.
(but if one exists please direct me to it!)

the bottom line is that they are a company &amp; they are setup to do what???
make money. its that simple.  we, as bus owners, are a small segment of
the market. since the trademark/copyright issue really only affects
such a small segment, they are likely to do nothing about it. :-(

what percentage of people have vintage vehicles on their minds when
they walk into a VW dealership to look into the purchase of a
current model?

what can we do about it? easy. as a consumer, don't buy one!

this is of course just MHO. all disclaimers apply.
