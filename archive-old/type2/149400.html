Subject: curtain fabric for early bay Westy

No, I don't have the ORIGINAL checkered pattern fabric, but my fabric store 
had a bolt of similar pattern and material on the discount table.

I just bought 6 yards of 54&quot; wide fabric at a really decent price.  With a 
good measuring stick, that is MORE than enough material to cover all the 
Westy windows.  I know, I just finished making a set of  curtains with'70's 
period material and it came out pretty decently.

The counter lady said she thought there was more than 6 yards left on the 
bolt (You would need 5 1/3 yards or 16 feet for 54&quot; wide fabric.  I just 
over-bought again!!  Perhaps I will have enough to make a privacy curtain 
between the driver/passenger compartment and the main body of the Westy..)

Normally, curtain to cover one window, either the sides or the rear is 
either 1x60&quot; or 2x30&quot;, so the 1x53&quot; is good enough.  There will still be 
sufficient bunching at the top when the curtains are closed.

My special 30% discount coupon expires on 14 Aug 05,.

With discount, the price is $2.79 / yard + taxes....  I paid like $17

I am going to take a picture of the fabric now, and I can sent a pic to 
anyone who responds to me via P-mail right now.  The squares are 1.2&quot;; 10 
squares to a foot, and both sides are near identical.
