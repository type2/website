Subject: Re: [T2] re: Painting Over Krylon

And the same type of phenomena occur's with the sandblasting routine
Tony--

You blow it all off--pressure wash it, wipe it down, blow it off some
more--

And you go to prime and or paint---

BANG---

Sand.

I never have figured this one out--but it always seems to happen to
me--and not in a corner--right out in the open--

This  where I learned all my choice French phrases---:&gt;)

If you're gonna use chemical stripper, then make absolutely positively
sure you've got it all out of the seams and wherever else it might
hide...Even if you think you've neutralized the stuff, it has a bad ha-
bit of bubbling thru' the next coat of paint...
