Subject: Pick-n-Pull parts

Went to the junkyards.  I really don't like those Pick-n-Pull places.  At
least I prefer what I had access to back in TX.  Are there any other places
that have more to offer?  I found more than I expected but it was still slim
pickings.

Why do they puncture all the gas tanks?  Why don't they just remove the
senders?  Especially with beetles!  They even put a hole in the bus gas
tanks from below ruining them.

Things of note that I saw, should have written more details down...

North San Jose Pick-n-Pull

'81 Vanagon -- L-Jet Engine mostly in tact, AFM (071 906 301), etc (no
trans), aux air reg, some parts in fan already removed.
'83 Vanagon
'71 Bus -- Instrument panel (no clock), (no engine, no trans)

South San Jose Pick-n-Pull

'81 Vanagon
'86 Vanagon
'70 Bus
'72 Bus
'77 Bus -- ECU (022-906-021AA, CA MT) , L-Jet Engine, EGR valve, EGR speedo,
complete exhaust (rusty), instruments, (all VINs scratched off!)

All the charcoal canisters are gone from the Vanagons. ;-) Hiding by the
rear wheel on the passenger side so I guess no one knew.  Off to the fish
store...
