Subject: Re: VW logo mud flaps

&gt;a similar set that were
&gt;made by Volkswagen of Venezuela, which we do come across periodically.
&gt;While they are &quot;legit,&quot; frankly they're not as nice as on the &quot;bogus&quot;
&gt;ones were. They're nice and heavy, but the white logos look like they
&gt;were colored in by my 4 year old.

I have a pair of these on my 65 and they don't look half bad.  I think I got them when Ron had a special on them a few years ago.  I get a lot of 
comments on them (good comments :).  The sloppy coloring isn't obvious unless you're right up on them.  I fabbed a bracket that seems to hold them 
pretty securely.  I'm especially glad to have them because I haven't replaced the missing bumper splash pans.  I mean, I assume they have some 
effect other than kewlness....
