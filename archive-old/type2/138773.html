Subject: Help to verify and answer

&gt; My engine is removed and I'm taking a close look at some problems I
&gt; noticed and
&gt; hopefully some of the fellow listmembers can help me out.

&gt; I have an 81 Vanagon 2.0 Liter FI with a CV series case, manual
&gt; transmission.
&gt; The  ATF dipstick/checker hole in my case, top upper left, next to
&gt; the trans to case retaining bolt shall be plugged.  YES?

If you are describing the hole in the case where you can see the back of the
flywheel the answer is yes it should have a plug in it but there are lots of
type 2 engines running around with no plug there, with no ill effects.

&gt;       With the rocker assemblies removed from an AVP rebuilt head, all the
&gt;       valves shall be closed and a straight edge will be able to rest on
&gt;       all 4 of the valve tips.  YES?

That's right!

&gt; And finally something that  or has happened twice in the engines' three
&gt; year
&gt; history. I've lost two of the plastic timing gauges to the belt jumping up
&gt; and
&gt; sawing thru it like a bandsaw. I've never seen it happen but I suspect it
&gt; occurs upon start-up as she hiccups/stutters to bring herself to life.
&gt;     I can't think of any cause for this except for the alignment of the
&gt; timing
&gt; marks on the gears or some serious endplay.  Any ideas someone can share?


End play, loose belt, warped pulley, missing spacer between crankshaft
pulley and crankshaft, pulley not centered on fan, excess crankshaft bearing
clearance. These things come to mind when you say damaged timing scale.
