Subject: [T2] A.I.R.S.: Kristins Bus

Kristin Laurites father called me the other night and ask me to assist him
in a couple if things regarding Kristin's bus.

As many of you know she was the yound lady that was recently murdered in
Arkansas while traveling across America to California from NJ.

He first asked me to help him place a value on the bus, a 1971 pot top.  He
needs this so the estate can be settled.  The second thing he asked me to do
was to assist him in selling the bus.

On the first issue, value.  I called Joe Fournier.  I know Joe and knew he
would be knowledgeable enough to give me a good estimate.  Joe had also seen
the bus and knew what it might sell for.  Mark, if you are reading I would
also like your opinion.

Joe told me the bus would be worth 1000 bucks tops with the engine not being
reliable at this point.  Kristin was planning on purchasing a new one when
she got to California as per Mr. Laurite.

I offered to Mr. Laurite the following:

I would like to see if the AIRS members on the list would entertain the idea
of purchasing the bus as a group.  I would take it a step further and work
toward making the bus a touring unit that would distribute travel education
materials at VW shows, rest stops, and any other place the driver at the
time sees fit.

This bus needs to become something more than just someone's personal daily
driver.  Kristin loved it and I think it would make a good memorial to her
and what she stood for as a person.  Just her family knowing it weas being
taken care of is something special enough.  It was a part of her in a manner
of speaking.

Now I am a one man show on this thinking, so I need some input from all of
you.  Sometimes I am way to narrow and simple minded.

I know this, it pisses me off royally that this young lady lost her life
traveling through these United States.  I know we can't save the world, but
that don't mean we can't try.

To make this the first A.I.R.S. bus would please her I think.  Mr. Laurite
sure seemed to think so anyway.

I am thinking a donation system of some sort would work fine.  The donations
could be toward the monetary purchase of the bus, then after that they could
be for restoration and making it roadworthy for the long-haul.

The proceeds raised will go toward Mr. Laurites effort to find Kristins
killer.  We can be a part of his effort and at the same time offer service
to others that might be traveling our highways.

I don't know exactly how, but if you have thoughts, please P mail me at

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,
