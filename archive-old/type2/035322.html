I'm forwarding the response I received from Axel Fisser...

&gt;Hi there,
&gt;please contact Riechert Tuning for new 2.0 liter cylinder heads. Riechert
&gt;Tuning is the only source for new original VW 412 cylinder heads. They can
&gt;modify those heads any way you want. By the way, only the 039 cylinder head
&gt;drops valve seats.
&gt;
&gt;Axel Fisser


BTW, what are 039 heads?  Must be all the ones they shipped to 
North America!
