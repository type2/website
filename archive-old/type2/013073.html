&gt;And the '67 is actually 3 of 4 there... solid is all it's missing and I am
&gt;working on that (OK, *Kelly* is working on that :-)
&gt;

Hey and not to rib Steve so far I will say this about the '67, it was damn
complete, though hardly gorgeous.

And it is a neat bus, more of a '66 than a '67 really, single pot master
cylinder, no back up lights, don't know about the door handles, and electrical
connection in '66 position.  A real F'in early '67, just 12V really is
about all
to show it isn't a '66.  And that is pretty darn cool.

Course there is a real straight '66 on samba right now in CA for $1300
or something, popup too, hell those 12V stickers cost what $1 or so?
