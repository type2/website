Hi Listees

I have a camper with a 2 litre 'Type 4' engine, which I think is on its
last legs......so the time has come to rebuild or replace it. At the same
time, I wish to increase the performance to around 90-100 BHP. After much
searching and head-scratchine, I have x realistic choices:

1. Rebuild stock, 70 BHP, around £600
2. Rebuild with 8:1 CR pistons &amp; barrels, enlarged heads, bigger carbs,
90-100BHP, £1100
3. Go for a watercooled conversion with adapter plate from Kennedy/similar:
          3a Subaru 1.8
          3b Ford V6 2.3/2.8 litre
          3c Golf 1.8 or similar (Rabbit I think in the USA)

Has anybody had experience with a mild power increase at an affordable
price? The one most favoured by me at the moment is number 2, the rebuild
with Porsche 914 P&amp;B kit and performance heads. I already have a pair of
carburettors (28/36DCD27, weird things picked up at a show ages ago) and
would need to recondition these and sort out a linkage as well, which would
take time but isn't beyond my abilities. Also, I'd have to use a
mechanical-only distributor (unless I can tap off the vacuum on the carb).

TIA for the help/advice
