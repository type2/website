Subject: Re: Any listees or VW salvage yards in North TX?

Well, if your VW breaks down and you need help there in Wichita Falls, I've
had good luck with Ray's Foreign Car (940-767-0530). Great guy, and he can
probably point you to salvage yards if that's what you're after.

&gt; I will be in Witchita Falls TX for two weeks 24 Arpil- 6
&gt; May. I would love to get together with any listees and look
&gt; through some salvage yards in the area. I will be staying
&gt; at Sheppard AFB so anything not too far away would be great.
