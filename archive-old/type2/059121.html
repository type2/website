&gt;When we purchased our bus, a '69 Campermobile.  We were told that it was
&gt;a woodstock edition.  Does anyone have any information about this or
&gt;anything close?
&gt;I have never herd any reference to anything close to this.
&gt;
&gt;Ant light on the subject would be nice.

I think you've been had....VW did not come out with any &quot;special editions&quot;
until 1971 when the &quot;Marathon&quot; beetle came out to celebrate the VW
surpassing the Model T as the most produced car. Then came the &quot;Champagne
Editions&quot; in 1977 and 1978..followed by the &quot;Wolfsburg Editions&quot; form 1979
onward.

Perhaps by Woodstock Edition the owner meant you have at least 10 pounds of
roaches and other drug paraphanalia hidden in the cabinets, under the
seats, etc. :-)
