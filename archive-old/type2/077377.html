Subject: Anyone in Houston to assist?

Hi guys-

My boyfriend is going to attempt to adjust the valves and do a compression 
check on the '68 Bus this week.  I don't suppose there's anyone in the 
Houston area that would like to come over and help guide us through the 
process?  He's a chef and I could almost guarantee that we'd feed you for 
helping out.
