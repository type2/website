John,

    You do not want a 1776 in a 73.  The 1776 is based on a Type 1 bug
motor.  Your 73 has a type 4 pancake motor in it. (or should have)  I had a
73 with a 2L motor.  It will work great if you can work out the carb setup.
I started out with a Weber 2 barrel &amp; went with a set of Dellorto 40mm.
Those were hard to tune but ran great once I got it.

&gt; I have a 73 Westfalia that I bought with no engine.  Emissions
requirements
&gt; aren't a concern for it in my state because of the age of the vehicle so I
&gt; can use any engine I want.  I was going to find a 2.0 liter for it but
&gt; people have been telling me  that I'd be better of to build a 1776 for it
&gt; because of the initial cost, reliability and availability of replacement
&gt; parts.  If you had a choice between a 1776 and a 2 liter what would you
&gt; choose and why?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; John
