Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

Ole &quot;dyslexic&quot; me again.  I meant to say the reverse.  Sorry for the
&quot;cornfusion&quot;.

Well, out of almost 300 sales of this boot, there was bound to be one (or
perhaps a few) where there's a &quot;monkey wrench&quot; in the works.  Using your
measurements in the pic, I'll have to see if VWG can make this one as well,
but can make no promises.  Had to pull teeth (several prototypes) to have
the &quot;B&quot; made.

&gt; To clarify, the B boot (New one in my pic,) is smaller by approx 5 mm when
&gt; referencing the grove that the shroud sits in.  The D boot (Old one in my
&gt; pic,) is the larger of the two in this comparison.

&gt; Surely I can't be the only person that has replaced the alternator boot on
&gt; a
&gt; bay with the same shroud as mine...which is stock as far as I can tell.  I
&gt; suppose for now I will clean up my old one which is not horrible,
&gt; thankfully.

&gt; &quot;Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's
&gt; experience.&quot;
