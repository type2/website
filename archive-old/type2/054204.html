Must be when the trend started. The new VWs don't even come with an ashtray
OR a lighter. if you want to smoke comfortably, you gotta pay extra and get
the &quot;smoking package&quot; ????
whatever.


&gt;Okay all you keepers of arcane Type2 knowledge. Here's one for 'ya: Why is
it
that the engineers of our little beasties saw fit to install a completly
functional ashtry, and a 12v. acc. socket, yet no FREAKING cig. lighter. I'm
&gt;on my fourth and last Westy (' 78, and this one they're gonna have to burry
me in before I sell her) and not one of them had a flipping lighter. (Not
that its a difficult install, takes all of 15 min.) The Vanagons got factory
lighters, but not us. What gives?
