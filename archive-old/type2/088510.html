Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle

[...]

I just took 4 pics of the early bay Westy handle. They are:
http://www.geocities_dot_com/aufevervw/westy_handle1.JPG
This one shows them looking pretty good.....but if you look close at the left
one, you will barely see a fine crack at the base of the small handle.

This one shows them from another angle. The left one really shows the cracks
at the hub.....that crack at 11:00 is the one that appears in pic 1.

This is a close-up of the left one. Sorry, it is the best I could with this
camera. Besides the big crack at 11, it has a half dozen other small cracks.
http://www.geocities_dot_com/aufevervw/westy_handle4.JPG
Here is the right one. No major cracks. But a few fine cracks.

Then just to show what the later Westy handles look like, I took pics of the
front and rear handles. The rear one is just a helper handle. It does not
move. It is only mounted on a fixed square shaft. There is no linkage in the
back of the door for the handle.

Hope this helps.

&gt; ok, please explain &quot;double ended&quot;, then. perhaps i am getting the wrong
&gt; image from that. the link only helped me see what the handle looks like.
&gt; when i looked on bustedbus, it was the same as that handle. it was a nice
&gt; visual to use as comparison against mine, so i AM glad you sent that
&gt; link. i guess i am just confused because i have so many people telling me
&gt; where to go and i still havent found anything like what i have.
