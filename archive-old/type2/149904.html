&gt; It seems like a good system.  If we ever have a bus as a &quot;keeper,&quot;
&gt; we'll definitely swap.  I was surprised at their condition, though,

&gt; to pit every second oil change (~6000mi)

There is a mild mileage boost using Pertronix. Even if you only get 1mpg
more it wll pay for itself in about 8000 miles at today's gas prices.

&gt; What is accepted practice for adjusting to different elevations?  We
&gt; came from 3500 feet in Missoula, through the mountains, and now are at
&gt; sea level in Maryland.  I'm sure we're a little lean and don't want to
&gt; pay someone with a sniffer to tell me that.  What is the AFM mixture
&gt; screw really doing?

VW tuned the engine differently anytime the elevation was 4,000 ft. or
higher according to them. Certainly there is a big difference at 3,500 ft.

When yo go up in the mountains the air rarefies and the engine goes a little
rich. Coming down to sea level the engine can lean out.

The mixture screw is a bypass mechanism just like the throttle body screw.
It largely affects the air fuel ratio at idle as the gearing and spring in
the AFM take care of the rest but it's not 100%.

If you turn the screw CW, will will reduce the amount of bypass air. Give it
a couple of turns and see what happens. It's always best to have a sniffer
around but remember the original position so you can turn it back if you
need to.
