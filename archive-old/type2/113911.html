&gt;yes, this is right. they have a captive washer also.

Sheet metal screws?  Excuse me?  Mine are machine screws, not sheet metal screws.  Maybe this is just a terminology conflict.  To me, sheet metal screws have very large, deep threads (similar to wood screws, but cover the entire screw) and a sharp point at the end and are NOT meant to be threaded into nuts.  They are not designed to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly.  Am I wrong?
