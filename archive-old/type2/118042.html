&gt; Hi Volks- Can anyone suggest a way to keep my radio settings when I
&gt; disconnect the battery?  I disconnect my battery every time I work on my bus
&gt; and I generally forget to reset the radio until I am on my way out of
&gt; town..... Ted (financial report coming- fund drive was a great success)

What you need is a disconect battery terminal.

Scroll down to just above the quick release battery terminals.
You can also purchase a device that plugs into the cigarette lighter but as 
you posted this on vintage bus you may not have one fitted right? Mike
