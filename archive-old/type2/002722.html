&gt; Also, these bushings do not have the 2 little oil holes like the
&gt; original ones. Can I get away with drilling them after they are
&gt; installed in the rods? Should I leave them as is?

Neither alternative strikes me as &quot;A Good Thing&quot; (as Martha Stewart
might say.)  If the original bushings had these oil holes then I have
to think they're there for a reason and *not* having them could screw
things up.  Too, trying to drill these &quot;in place&quot; strikes me as an
impossible task and fraught with problems.

If you're going to the time and expense of rebuilding an engine then
I'd say &quot;Don't guess.&quot;  If I were you I'd press those suckers out and
then go and get the correct bushings.
