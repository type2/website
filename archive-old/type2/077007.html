&lt;&lt; I know it's a little different from what your problem is, but I solved one 
of the the cold breezes in mine by simply pulling the curtains to. Makes it 
a little hard to see sometimes, but it made a pretty big difference this 
past weekend.

Right above the seats is a roof bracket...A clear (get the heavy stuff
from an upholstery shop) plastic curtain can be hung from it to drop
behind the seats and partition the front of the cab from the rest of 
the interior.
