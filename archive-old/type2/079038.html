Subject: rear hatch window installation

it finally quit raining here a few days ago &amp; i discover that my rear hatch
is leaking somewhere. so, i decide to install the rear hatch window seal i
got from BD a while back. did the minor but needed rust treatment, let dry
overnight &amp; now ready to install.  BUT, it's just being a real PITA to get
back in.  i've replaced seals before, so i do have some experience in this
area. of course i am using the standard &quot;wire in the outer groove&quot; trick
with a little soap for lube.

for those that have replaced this seal, would working for top-to-bottom or
bottom-to-top be the best method? does that even matter?

searched the archives on this &amp; didnt really learn anything specific about
installing the rear window. the seal fits nicely around the glass, i just
can't figure out what i'm doing wrong on the installation.

any tips or hints would really be great.  it's not supposed to rain here
again until Friday, so i figure i've got a couple more days to get the
window in.

TIA.
