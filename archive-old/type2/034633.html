Subject: Re: 1970 SC for sale in Austin

I have put this up to the list in the past as a possiblitly but now it is a
for sure. I want to sell my 1970 single cab. (I am also selling my 1969
beetle). I want to concentrate all my energy on my other two cars.

I have the 1600 SP engine that was replaced by the 1776 and it gets thrown
in gratis. I am willing to be very negotiable on my asking price especially
to list members. If you are interested please let me know and what the heck
make an offer!
