that hot air could be routed back to the engine compartment and, if
the inlet was strategically placed, reduce warmup time significantly.
once at operating temp, the heater box flaps could be opened,
directing heat to the cabin. *let's hear those opinions!*

The heat exchangers are fairly massive pieces of metal heated by
exhaust gases.  The heads are relatively lightweight and are warmed
directly by combustion heat.  My feeling is that by the time that the
heat exchangers are warm enough to flow some heat the heads and
cylinders will already be warm.
