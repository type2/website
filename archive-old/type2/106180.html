&gt; &gt; Just got my first bus ('79 Westy) and boy oh boy am I gonna need some
&gt; &gt; advice soon!   
&gt; 
&gt; Welcome. Get the green Bentley manual if you haven't already.

ditto, I have a 78 and just got back from the best get together of busses
in my life,  great job Chris and the folks at everybus.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I've found so far:
&gt; &gt; 1.  Low compression #3 (50#)

could be a number of different reasons, more information is helpful

&gt; &gt; 2.  Water coming through rear heater vent.  &quot;Hey, is it supposed to be
&gt; &gt; cold in here?&quot; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Under the rear bench or under the fridge (if you have one)?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3.  Front axle beam rusted through (didn't see that!) at center pivot
&gt; &gt; point.  (just a small hole).

this could be a real problem, I got a nice one recently from BustedBus
he's a list member

&gt; &gt; 5.  Steering requires a pretty heavy effort, is this normal?
&gt; 
&gt; If the tires are properly inflated if will feel heavy until you get up to
&gt; taxying speed. ;-) The large steering wheel and lack of power steering fluid
&gt; container is a hint that it's normal.

you'll get used to it
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Other than that, it's just fine! :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My main question right now is does anyone know where I can find a new
&gt; &gt; axle beam?  I've seen the adjustable ones, I think I want to find a
&gt; &gt; stock unit.
&gt; 
&gt; New ones are hard to find these days. Last ones I heard of came from Europe
&gt; thanks to Bus Depot but they've since been sold. Perhaps a listmember
&gt; grabbed one and has it for sale.

see above about getting a good one from BustedBus

&gt; &gt; What should I check on the engine before I pull it, or can I do all my
&gt; 
&gt; Get a state of the engine before you make changes. Do you have a starter on
&gt; a bench setup? Can you deliver fuel and route exhaust? Probably not.

yes, it takes some equipment to do a bench test of any engine

&gt; Check compression, idle rpm, dwell, fuel pressure and manifold vacuum. That
&gt; way you can see the difference you made after your rebuild and assembly
&gt; which will start with a valve adjustment.

remember a stock 79 has hydraulic lifters and are adjusted differently

&gt; The best advice I can give you while the engine is out is to thoroughly go
&gt; over the electrical ground system (engine and transmission) and clean all
&gt; the contacts. More than one person has taken the engine out put it in and
&gt; it's failed to work for mystery reasons.

also REPLACE ALL of your fuel lines...ALL OF THEM

&gt; &gt; Should I convert from FI to carburetor as long as it's working?
&gt; 
&gt; This has been said many time: no, that is unless you want to give me the
&gt; parts. ;-)

only if you have the carbs and all the set up and linkages and want poorer
performance and fuel economy, and in my opinion it will never run right,
it was designed as a FI vehicle and will almost always work better that
way

the FI is not that hard to work on, just different

good luck 

Bob
