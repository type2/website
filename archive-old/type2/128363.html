Subject: Re: [T2] platinum plugs revisited (ngk)

ronnie

i saw your catalog lists only the NGK B6HS
i did a little searching and found the cross ref chart

B5HS :: W8AC
B6HS :: W7AC

I think ive typically used the hotter plug (W8) because it is supposed to
foul less in everyday driving.

You list the W7 and W8 but only the B6 so....why?
