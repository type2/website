Subject: Bently CD rom

Anyone have this Bently CD rom microfiche for 75-79 model years?
http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=VFT2&amp;subject=20

Is the info that much different than the Bently manual?
Ive been looking for that second edition Bently also. I think it had a yellow
cover. Have any of you guys been able to find it?
