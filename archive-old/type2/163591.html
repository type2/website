Subject: Where to buy studs?

Folks -
  Anyone have a good source for the tranny mounting studs?  I finally
found the size i need to mount my engine on the stand (10mm x 1.5)
correct me if I'm wrong here.  Since I'd like to get this engine up
and torn down asap, would it be a bad idea to just buy a long bolt
from the hardware store and cut off the bolt head just to mount it to
the stand while I wait for the studs to arrive? I figured id use 2
nuts on the bolt to screw it into the engine as to not ruin the
threads.
Thanks
--Nick
