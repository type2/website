Subject: auto tranny in bentley manual?


&gt; Hello all, I've got a question.  Is the later model auto tranny with
govenor
&gt; mentioned anywhere in Bentley manual?  It only seems to mention the early
&gt; model autotranny.  Is the later model auto tranny covered in the Vanagon
&gt; Bentley?  I'm in the process of putting a 76 autotranny in a 74 automatic
&gt; and just wanted to review some things.  Thanks in advance.  Marcus
&gt;
