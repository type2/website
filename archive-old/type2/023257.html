Subject: rear brake adjustment
Mime-Version: 1.0

here's a question:

so i'm adjusting my new brakes last night.  the bentley manual doesn't 
describe which direction the stars need to turn.  my haynes manual says, 
&quot;the star towards the front goes up, the back goes down.&quot;

i found this to be false...on the driver's side.  this statement is true on 
the passenger side.

so what's the deal..?  which way are they supposed to go?
