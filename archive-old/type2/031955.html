&gt; questions: is this Model worth restoring? is there and shortcomings in

Worth it for what?  If for some reason you've always wanted an air-cooled 
Vanagon and putting the new engine in brings it up to primo condition and 
you'll drive it for a long time, then maybe it's worth it to you, and not 
to other people.  You can buy a decent air-cooled Vanagon in this neck of 
the woods (California) a lot cheaper than what your mechanic is telling 
you the new engine plus installation will cost, but, of course, it won't 
have a new engine.

&gt; what kind of money  am I looking at for a rebuild or motor + labor. Is
&gt; it worth it to rebuild than to buy new engines?

Well, at this stage of the game any Vanagon engine is going to be 
rebuilt, not &quot;new&quot;, so it comes down to who's doing the rebuilding, how 
good the rebuild is in the first place, the cost of the rebuild, etc., etc.

Frankly, on a strict dollars and cents basis, i.e., the cost of 
transportation, or even the cost of the use of a &quot;van-like&quot; vehicle for 
hauling, etc. it doesn't make sense to sink lots of money in an old car, 
especially if that car doesn't have the possibility of some sort of 
collector or antique value (which I don't think the Vanagon does.)  And 
this disparity gets worse if you're forced to pay professionals to do the 
work instead of doing the work youself and rationalizing that the time 
you put into it is more than made up by &quot;psychic rewards.&quot;

Of course decisions about cars, like decisions about most things in life, 
aren't necessarily made on a rational basis, at least how you personally 
define what's &quot;rational.&quot;

Trying to wax a little less philosophical and answer your question more 
directly:  most local mechanics don't do &quot;complete&quot; rebuilds themselves 
but generally buy them from the volume rebuilders.  IF you mechanic says 
that a complete rebuild is in order, ask him if he'll be doing the work 
himself or if he'll be buying it from someone else.  If he'll be doing 
the work himself, ask him to write out exactly what he'll do in this 
rebuild and what sort of parts he'll be using.  If he's buying the engine 
&gt;from someone else, find out who he's buying from and how much it costs.  
Then come back to the list with this information and you'll get much 
better feedback.


&gt; this mech told me a new engine installed  would be around 3000...is that
&gt; good? |; thank you in addvance-- 

Seems a little high, but he may just be projecting an upper end figure to 
protect himself.  And, it also depends where the engine's coming from and 
what else he might be including in the &quot;new engine installed&quot; definition.

If you figure around $1,300 - $1,400 for the engine, maybe another $200 - 
$300 for clutch stuff (assuming that's part of the job) and then about 8 
hours for removal/install/get running/incidentals/supplies then that 
figure is somewhere in the ballpark.
