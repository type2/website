Subject: Good Internet Source For Diamond Plate

Hiya Volks !

     I am getting ready to redo my garage and want to make my work table
surface and also maybe use some extra diamond plate to put in the place of
my firewall as mine is really banged up. My problem is that I live a good
distance from any real town and I have gone and checked at my local shops ,
I was told I had to wait about a week so they could find it and check their
price (hence large mark-up I was betting - and when I did find out, I about
had a heart attack).
 
    I have done Yahoo, Altavista, MSN, Lycos, Type2 archive, The Samba, and
a few other places with not much exact luck. Either its about ppl who
already had it installed and no info on where purchased (I know, check to
see if there is a e-mail and ask, and hence why I am starting with the
masses before going door to door asking). I have searched for diamond plate,
chrome, chrome diamond plate, anti-fatigue plate, steel plate, flooring,
cabinets.

	As you can see, I have gone and looked around and without a lot of
luck, so if any of you have used diamond plate, know where to get it without
having to sell my 1st born (but he's been messing up lately, maybe the 1st
born isn't such a bad idea.. lol - j/k.

Thanks so much for all your help :-)
