Dear Brian.

Try a wreckers yard in Sweden, where headlamp washers for the 1973-79 VW 
Type 2, appear to have been a standard fitting.

The Swedish Car Dismantlers Association, is:-

Sveriges Bilskrotares Riksforbund
Box 17
SE-47321 Henan
Sweden

Tel. +46 31 711 8901
Fax. +46 31 711 8904

Sorry, I don't have any web site or e-mail details.

If you learn of any Swedish wreckers' yards which deal with 1968-83 VW Type 
2s, I would be pleased to hear from you.

Regards.
               Nigel A. Skeet
