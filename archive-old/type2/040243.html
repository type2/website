Subject: Re: Rear seat belts, was Bus Legalities

Hi George!

&gt; Hmmm, If I stuff the seatbelts behind the back seats, my '71 station wagon
&gt;  would
&gt;  be be a legal carpool vehicle with 2 aboard!  :)

It's a bit more complex than that, sadly.  Even tho there are no seatbelts, 
there is still a place for passengers to sit.  Ergo, it wouldn't work...  
Unless... If you were to drop the back seat so the back was obviously a cargo 
area (maybe with cargo in it) then you'd be OK.  Was the reason the back of 
the bus was made into a bed... that way it was obvious it wasn't &quot;seating&quot;, 
even tho I could have transformed it into a seat in minutes.  

&gt;  Luckily, I live far enough away that I am unlikely to try this!
  
But... if you ever need to, this is how.  I *know* it works.  I had a mazda 
wagon years ago that belonged to a photographer, that literally bolted the 
back seats down, as his biggie was room for his equipment (Funny, it was the 
same green as the van too!).  Anyway, it was considered a 2 seater, 'cuz it 
was set up like this.  

About Mazda's... I remember something about someone dropping a mazda rotary 
in place of a volksie motor.  Has anyone heard of this?  I know they had 
their quirks, and their own maintenance thingies (like seals every 100K or 
so) but they had a lot of power for the size.  Any thoughts? Has it been done 
to a bus, and how?
