Subject: Re: leaky valve covers


I cured my chronic leaker by following list advice frm
many moons ago... clean both mating surfaces very well
and polish with a 3m type abrasive pad. Takes some
patience and elbow grease but worth the effort.
  Use the cork/thick gaskets pretreated (not soaked)
with clean oil. stick the gasket to the valve cover
and install. When you feel it kinda of seat give a
little push up to get it snug then pop the bale wire
over it.

   Unless your cover is badly warped the cork gasket
should take up the gap. but it seems any little piece
of old gasket or adhesive will give the stuff a route
to escape from captivity.
