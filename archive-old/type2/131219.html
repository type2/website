Subject: Voltage drop on a gas heater, other concerns?

     I am looking into gas heaters for this winter.  If I purchase a 6v gas 
heater can I simply wire it with an inline voltage dropper?  Are there any 
special concerns using these voltage droppers with a gas heater?  Is there 
any great disadvantage to the 6v heaters?
     Along the same lines, is it possible and worthwhile to convert 6v gas 
heaters to 12v?  What parts would need to be changed for it to run on 12v?
     I have read some of the things in the archive and library.  I would 
like to use the other side of the engine compartment for a dual battery set 
up, so I will be placing my gas heater in some other (as yet to be 
determined) non-stock location.  Any suggestions?  Anything I should be 
concerned with in placement of the gas heater?  If I am correct, I should be 
okay as long as I use common sense and make sure the exhaust goes outside of 
the bus, right?
