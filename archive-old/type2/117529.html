Subject: Re: [T2] 79 into 72

&gt; looking at pictures of a 72 for sale in the area. The 72 has no engine or 
&gt; tranny and it is not a camper. I'm not sure about the body yet, but if it is 
&gt; in ok condition I was considering using it. Would it be possible to install 
&gt; the engine and tranny and camper equipment from my 79 into the 72. The 
&gt; engine is rebuilt stock. The tranny is a stock automatic. I may want to use 

the tranny should fit IF the 72 is also an automatic but otherwise much of
the transmission mounting is different than a manual, even the accelerator
linkages are different...unfortunately switching manual - automatic is a
major project, several people on the list have done it but it was not easy
and required welding skills
