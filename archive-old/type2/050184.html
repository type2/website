Subject: [T2] Poptop up!!

Kia ora and greetings,
We have a Dormobile Poptop, hinges from the side, has a flashing light which
does it's thing if the ign is on and the top is up. 
What a silly idea I thought, who in hell could drive with this monster up.
Ha Ha Ha
Well one day we had the top up for the kids to play in the beds, in the
evening I went out to move the bus back into the driveway, hopped into the
drivers seat from the drivers side, fired up and whoa !! whats the flashing
light? momentary panic as low oil pressure and other scenarios raced through
my mind but eventually looked up and realised....
What a joke. 
Never driven with it up but realise there is the possibility, which is why
the &quot;idiot&quot; light is there.
Best wishes
