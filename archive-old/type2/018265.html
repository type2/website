Hi Ed and Melissa,

I recently had a similar problem with my 76 FI not idling well util
warmed up.  It turned out to be the temp sensor on the no. 3 head.  A
mechanic had put in a new one for me, and it was way off.  Must have
been the wrong part number.  I measured the old one, and it was 2250
ohms right on the nose.  The new one was about 1500 ohms.

Also, a week earlier I did that fix for the AFM of enlarging the holes
of the resistor plate so I could move it around and avoid the bad
spots.  It SORT of worked, for about a day or two.  Then it started in
doing the same thing again!  I started looking elsewhere, but always
came back to the fact that it worked temporarily, then started
malfunctioning again.  (mysterious hesitations, loss of power
particularly at one area of the power curve.

Finally It got worse and worse, and decided to not go ten feet on a
lonely mountain road.  I had no phone, no money to get a tow anyway, and
it was getting dark.  I thought hard and realized that I must have bent
up the copper wiper arm so it wasn't making enough contact.  The area of
the carbon plate it was wiping over looked fine.  So I simply pushed
down on the wiper while it was idling roughly and it cleared up!  I then
took off the two wires for the AFM temp sensor, took out the four flat
blade screws for the plug, took out the three screws holding in the
carbon plate, and carefully pulled it out.  I then pushed down on the
copper wiper and bent it enough to give it more contact pressure.  Put
it all together, and it worked beautifully!  That sure is a fine
feeling, to solve your own problems, it is!
