&gt; I love the idea, but you'd not only have to protect the business from

As I said, it works better as a &quot;thought experiment&quot; than as a real 
plan. Once you get your head inside it, you get to ask interesting 
questions. For instance: if you were doing this, would you reuse 
fasteners? Or would you replace every screw, nut, bolt, and washer in 
the bus with new?

The answer to that question alone gives you and me a different way of 
thinking about our buses at home.
