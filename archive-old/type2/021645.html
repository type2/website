Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Tank Question

Todd
One of the things that the FI tank that the non-FI tank does not is a small
built in sump inside the tank.  This is needed in those tanks if you want to get
more than 11 gallons out of a 15 gallon tank.

I used a FI tank in my DC.  The supply and return lines were too small for my
system, so I got some AN parts and welded a supply port just below the sump and
welded up the old return.  I then welded a new return port on the top of the
tank and above the sump.  I thought this would be good enough.

I now have an early warning system (very irritating) when the tank gets too low
and I make a right turn.  In these tanks there is a lot of left to right
movement of the fuel.  Right turn and all the fuel is over on the left side of
the tank and away from the intake.  Left turn and you have all the fuel you
need.

The reason for my welding ports rather than using the stock FI ports is that I
put a CIS FI system out of a '79 Volvo onto my Type IV motor that's sitting in
the '60 Double Cab.  The CIS system has a bit higher pressure than the
L-Jetronic and I wanted good thread on connections rather than press on hoses.

Since you have already cleaned, etched and sealed the existing tank, it sounds
like your best bet would be to fabricate yourself your own sump and return the
fuel through one of the vent ports in the top.  That way you don't have to mess
up the nicely restored tank.

I have heard of marine systems using the T-fitting for the return line, but this
concerns me (maybe needlessly).  I'll explain why.

In the FI system you have the high pressure supply and lower pressure return.
Your system pressure is regulated at a set value.  With pressure system, if you
restrict the return line, the system pressure will go up.  Depending upon the
design of the FI system, this could either do no harm or cause mixture problems
like running too rich.

My concern about returning the fuel at the bottom of the tank with a T, is that
with a full tank of gas, you have that weight of fuel providing resistance to
the return. As the tank empties, the resistance reduces.  Coming back the top
and there is no resistance regardless of tank level.  The twin tanks on my Jag,
both have the return lines at the top of the tank.

Hope this helps

&gt; I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system into my

&gt; the fuel tank. I currently have a non-FI tank that I; cleaned, etched, and
&gt; polymer coated. I would like to be able to keep this tank, but as read
&gt; through the archives there seems to be no other optons aside from brazing a
&gt; fuel return port into my current tank or purchasing a used good used FI
&gt; tank. I am going to throw out a couple of ideas to the &quot;Bouncing Wall&quot;: #1
&gt; Could I possibly run the fuel return line to one of the top vent ports on my
&gt; tank? #2 Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard fuel port
&gt; on the bottom of the tank? I've tried Miller Fuel Injection (thanks Mark)
&gt; and
&gt; they offer a sump kit which is a little cost prohibitive at $149.
