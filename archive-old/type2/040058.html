Subject: Re: Fuel Neck and plasti-dip

If I can find some time this weekend, I'm'agonna try an experiment to see if 
either liquid-electrical-tape or plasti-dip will stand up to gasoline. I'll 
let you know what my findings are.  But hey-if it's the difference between 
driving your bus, and letting it sit for want of a filler tube, and your old 
one is at least still there, consider coating the inside and outside of the 
old one with silicone caulk. After it cures, silicone will stand up to most 
anything. Hey-even submerging the tube in a good latex paint, pulling it out 
slowly, and hanging it up and letting it dry well should seal cracks. Might 
keep you moving till you can find a new one.
