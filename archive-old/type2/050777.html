Pete,
The EXACT same thing happened to my 1975 camper.
It froze and I did all the things you said with no results.  Then I got Pi$$ed off and put more than a few drops of penetrating oil down the little tube (sorry, don't know the technical terms) where the ebrake cables goes to the wheel. My mood at the time caused me to put down the ball-peen hammer and opt for a 3 pound hand sledge hammer.  I whacked BOTH rear drums in a manner that would have caused them to rotate BACKWARD (if they were'nt frozen). And Wham! It freed itself up!  I don't know if it helped, but before I did this I also completely loosened up the ebrake cable right under the front cab.  However, I think my frustration in the matter was my best tool, because it really made me give the drums a good whack which I may otherwise not have done.  Anyway, good luck!
