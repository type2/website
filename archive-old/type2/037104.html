Subject: BN 4 in Fresno, Calif.

I cruised the wrecking yards today....the rains have left us alone for a few
days. I found a 72 bus that appears to have come from Canada. It has a
complete BN 4 heater in it. Anyone want it? I would have to remove it. Has
the air intake grille in the left rear trim panel, has the timer switch in
the dash etc.

Was someone looking for 78-79 sliding windows?  Found a 78.
