Subject: sparky plug wires

ive always had good luck with the elcheapo wells ignition wire sets.  ive
got a set on my bug and bus.  go to the local farm and fleet or even
wal-mart and pick up the &quot;custom 4 cylinder set&quot;.  cost about 5 bucks,
plus sometimes they run a 2 dollar rebate on them.  but you will need the
little screw on dealy to make them work.  scrounge up a set, or just buy
new  plugs.  my almost local autozone (30 miles away) sells bosch platinum
plugs for something like 1.79.  they come with the screw caps.  it set me
back about 12 dollars total with tax, and i havent had to worry about
anything since.  the only problem is the wires tend to be quite long, so
watch out when routing them.
