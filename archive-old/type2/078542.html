Subject: Unfortunate news...



Well, it turns out that the DMV was *closed* yesterday so I looks like I
won't be able to register my car...


.... until tomorrow!

WOO HOOO!!!!!!!!!!

Yup, it passed smog.  They toyed with it a little and now it's running a
perfect 14:1 air/fuel ratio at 15 and 25 mph so that makes me pretty
darn happy :)

This has been the most annoying struggle, and has lasted, I dunno, 5
months now.  Aw man.. whew!  Thanks to everyone that helped me out with
this all.  I really, really appreciate it!

Now it's on to rebuilding the original engine that I blew, and then
rebuilding another after that :)

thanks again!!
Mike
