&gt; No doubt. Getting any of them to do a VW speedo for a non-Porsche price is

Or perhaps the issue is with asking for highly skilled, quality work for
&quot;VW&quot; prices?

The VW community at large never seems to want to pay quality money for
quality work.

I've been quoted between $120 and $200 to repair and recalibrate my
speedo, and these prices sounded very reasonable to me.

To do it properly requires special tools, special knowledge, and /time/.

If you get such service as the T34 guy got, with face and needle
restoration as well, expect that the shop will have 3-4 hours into the
unit.  At $150 dollars, that's less then $40/hr for skilled labor,
shop time, and materials...and that's not bad. IMHO.

I pay more per hour to get tires mounted and balanced, but still find it
hard to find quality. (20$ tire, four tires takes 15 minutes, 20 on the
outside...you do the math.)
