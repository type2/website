Subject: Re: [T2] Listees ? Vintage and Type II

Chris and bus vans of both camps...

Having owned and driven both for more than a few years....

Driver height...6'4&quot;....gotta hump over in the splitty to see out well
and see stoplights turn green.

Bad as we think the bay seats are, &quot;I&quot; think the splits are worse for big 
guys....and believe me, I spent a lot of time in my 67 as it was my daily 
driver for almost 5 years or so.  I spent a lot of time on the road in it 
and with my left foot parked on the under dash tray trying to keep from 
getting terminal dead bu** syndrome.

Better brakes and cross wind control in a bay(at least I think so) and 
more power...yes, I had a big engine in my 67 too, but ended up throwing a 
rod thru the top of it because of all the rpm's.  Ya just haven't had any 
fun at all untill you have been stopped at midnight by a cop because you 
were weaving and he thought you were drunk....he didn't realize there was 
a 30-40mph cross wind and a blizzard that had anything to do with it.

But!  I surely did love it!

Just my opinion....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Usefulness. Baywindow campers are more useful I think and would guess other folks think too.

&gt; Any more?
