Another source of information about the bus restoration (bodywork...) is the website 
of one of the member of the Type2 mailing list.

For me Kelly Brown Jr., from Archdale, NC. better known as MetalWizard, has some 
of the clearest pictures of the work needed on the refinishing of those old vehicles. 
Kelly has been very cooperative for me when I needed information on the restoration 
of my 72 West (which is presently on the stop mode awaiting the refinishing of my 
own garage...:-(( )

The website address is : &lt;&lt;http://www.metwiz_dot_com/&gt;&gt; and the site is updated 
relatively frequently so we can see different models and different problems and the 
solutions applied.

Hope this help...
