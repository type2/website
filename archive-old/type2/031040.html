&gt;    The other day i started it up and let it run to warm up a little. about 30

&gt; no coughin', it just stalled. I started it back up and drove around the block 
&gt; like five times to keep it goin, and once it was warm, it kept running.

?? Thermo time switch ???

check the plugs (wiring) to the time switch.
also check your points, sounds (its a stretch) like they could be loose
also check you fuel filter, change it if it is older than a month old

&gt;    Well, Becky drove me home and here i am all buggin out about my FI system 
&gt; actin up right before i depart on a 10,000 mile journey. I would like to cure 

this doesn't sound like FI problems, usually they are kinda consistant,
sounds more fuel or electrical
