&gt;I'm sure you're right about this, Richard. In fact, I looked up the URL 
&gt;you sent, and you are absolutely right. But in addition to not wanting 
&gt;to spend the time, I also don't want to have this conversation, in 
&gt;person or on the phone:
&gt;
&gt;Me: Do you carry Loctite THX 118?
&gt;
&gt;Clerk (&quot;associate'): No, we don't carry that.
&gt;
&gt;Me: Know anyone who does?
&gt;
&gt;Clerk: No, I don't. It's not too popular.

Mark, you are taking this all too seriously. It's only a suggestion and doesn't require a long explanation of why you do things the way you do. If you are indeed short on time...

This advice, like always, is for everyone:

Call Loctite give them your zipcode and they will tell you which vendor in your area has ordered 574 recently. It's that simple. I can't guarantee your closest vendor will have one in stock but that's what I do everytime I need Loctite products.

Who is interested in group buy on this stuff so you have some handy for your next rebuild? I can ship a 50ml bottle to anyone in the US for $17 which includes shipping. pmail if interested.
