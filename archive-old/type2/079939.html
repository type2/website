Subject: RE: [T2] Bus insurance

&gt; Also, be careful with &quot;antique&quot; insurance...If you
&gt; should be stopped by a knowledgable officer, you'd best have a parade or
&gt; show flyer to back up your being on the road.


That varies by state. In PA, it used to be that antique cars could not be
driven at night, and could only be driven to and from car events.  But due
to a change in the law, according to my local tag agency, one day per week
of &quot;pleasure use&quot; is now permitted, as well as nighttime use as long as the
vehicle is equipped with moden lighting.  Other states, however, are much
more strict.
