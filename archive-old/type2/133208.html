Subject: Re: [T2] how long are battery cables

Bob,

Whatever you do, *Please* buy the ones that look like cables on &quot;modern&quot;
cars...not the leaded ones.

Not that I am against the lead in them, but the later model stuff in 
combination with the little felt anti-corosion pads just work so much 
better.

Yes, they will cost more, but in my experience, they are worth every cent.

You should see them on the rack along with the &quot;leaded&quot; ones.

Seems like 31&quot; or so for my 78 for the positive.  and maybe 12&quot; for the 
negative...the negative I bought had 2 ground lugs on it...I put one under 
the fi box and the other in the regular place....double ground!

Remember battery terminals are *not* the same size.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I been thinking of putting new cables on my batteries and was wondering
&gt; before heading off to the FLAPS,  how long are the plus and neg cables
&gt; from battery to starter/ground.   sure I could measure em, but I thought
&gt; maybe someone might have the number off the tops of their head.
