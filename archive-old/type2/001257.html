     Well I think I found the source of my pinging on my 79 Std.  With the
stock distributor, the total advance is supposed to be about 25-26 degrees
max.  Mine is 33 degrees.  It is timed at 5BTDC &amp; it is supposed to be
7.5BTDC.  Almost all the advance is coming from the centrifugal part &amp; about
9 degrees is from the vacuum part.  The question is, do I look for a new
distributor or do I just set the timing at idle to whatever it takes to get
25-26 degrees of total advance?  Any ideas?  Thanks.
