Subject: Bus sighting (F)

  Rented a move called 'Killing Time'.  The killers spend
most of their time in a light blue VW bus.  It's set in
England so the interior reflects the change.  I thought it
was funny when the bus was tailing their target.  How can
you not notice a bus behind you for miles?
