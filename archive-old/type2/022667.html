Al, Joe and the List,

Instead of expensive mics or bore gauges, why not just use a piston ring and
measure the ring gap?  Use a piston to square up the ring in the cylinder and
using a set of feeler gauges, measure the gap and several places along the
cylinder bore.  I bet you get a very accurate measurement done very easily.
This would give you a good idea of cylinder taper.  I'm not so sure about an
out of round cylinder though.  Comments?

&lt;A good inside mike is really helpful- well, a bore guage is REALLY
helpful, measuring anything with an inside mike takes a lot of feel and
practice (but there's only one way to get the practice, right?) &gt;
