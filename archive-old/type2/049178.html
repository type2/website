Subject: Re: [T2] gas heater questions

&gt; compartment isn't really an option, and the archives
&gt; don't mention much about other mounting methods.

You could try to get an Eberspächer BA6 which mounts under the cargo
floor. it is a flat heater which become part of the central heating tube
that runs from the back of the buds to the front.

&gt;  Also, I've only been able to
&gt; find (and afford) a B2 and  a Stuart Warner.  Any
&gt; feedback on which is better?  Thanks for the help.

I just sold my B2 because I didn't really look forward to work on it. It
is quite an old unit (1960ties) and has some savety problems. one of
them is that if there is a gasoline-leak the fuel pump keeps on pumping.
Also, if this pump is broken it is impossible to get a replacement.
I was advised that before I were to install it first an expert should
inspect and test it.
