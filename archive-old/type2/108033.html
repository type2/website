Subject: Re: [T2] door rubber really tight

Greg,
     You said.....
        &quot;The other unfortunate result of using that seal is that my
wife now has a habit of slamming the unholy $%^&amp; out of the passenger
door. Which isn't even necessary, as the passenger door still has its
original seal in good condition. What's a guy to do&quot;.......

Let me suggest this.  Walk to the passenger's side of the bus with
your wife, open the door, wait for her to get in, and then close the
door for her.  Not only will you be saving your bus all that abuse,
but maybe you'll make points with your wife!  This just might result
in your &quot;honey do&quot; list getting shorter....lololol

Everybody have a great weekend
