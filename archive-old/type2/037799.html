&gt; Thanks all! A puller - duh! I'll be heading down to my FLAPS to buy or
&gt; rent one in the morning.

You know what working on my bus is teaching me folks? Getting the right
tool for the job makes all the difference - went and took advantage of
the free &quot;Loan-A-Tool&quot; at my FLAPS and brought home a puller. Less than
5 minutes after getting home, the pulley is off with no stress at all.
Contrast that with an hour of not accomplishing much of anything
yesterday... jeesh :-)

Thanks again for your collective wisdom!

Now I'm back outside to split the case - woohoo!
