&gt; &lt;&lt; So let me ask this.  what distributor is? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; No question about it, the correct model #, original stock distributor is the
&gt; best.  There is a very complete list in the library of type2_dot_com.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can't find a rebuilt or used correct stock distributor, contact John
&gt; at aircooled_dot_net and get one of their dual advance distributors.  Have your
&gt; engine specs ready.
&gt; 
&gt; Third best would probably be a centrifugal only advance .050 distributor.  It
&gt; can be timed closer to your engine's specs and will run OK, though you will
&gt; sacrifice some performance and fuel economy.

You are leaving out another excellent option - Mallory distributors. Also
sold by aircooled_dot_net. There are many options available: mechanical advance
only, mech/vac advance, single points, dual points, unilite (no points). The
best of these IMO would be a the mechanical and vacuum advance model with
unilite. The advance is completely adjustable on both the vacuum and
mechanical circuits, it could easily be set up to duplicate exactly the
factory distributor advance curve, minus the retard.

There are a few advantages to the Mallory over the other options: #1 they
are new. #2 they are fully adjustable. For those inclined to tinker,
significant performance improvements are there to be had, both in actual HP
and fuel economy. Jake Raby has done dyno work on type IV motors to support
both of these claims. #3 Parts are available, since they are a current
product. If you have a vacuum canister go south on a bosch distributor, you
are pretty much SOL on getting the correct replacement. Every part on a
Mallory distributor is widely available as a spare.

The Mallory distributors are expensive, that is the only problem. The SVDA
form aircooled_dot_net is an excellent option if the Mallory is out of reach.
