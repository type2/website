Subject: Rust again!

Hi Volksfolks,

I've been lurking since August. 
  We are restoring a '72 Westy. Pulled the interior out today. Some rust
repair required, lots of scrub-work in addition to repairs... 
Two questions: Opinions, please, on M. Bulley's rust pages, particularly
in regards to over-coating floor and undercarriage...
Also what about the liquid someone mentioned that &quot;turns rust into
metal&quot;? Did I understand that correctly? Where can I get some of this
stuff (sounds like alchemy to me...)
And yes, a third: Does the archive list repair info, in detail, for heat
systems? We're freezing!
Thanks!

Jerry Lovejoy
