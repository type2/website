&gt; As before I'll be wearing a bright yellow baseball cap.  I'm old and ugly
and 
&gt; about 6' tall with dark hair and beard and glasses, and I walk with an 
&gt; aluminum cane.  I may try wearing a &quot;Type 2 List&quot; badge again, but it
hasn't 
&gt; made any difference in the past...

I'll be there after about 1:00. Medium old.  Full boat ugly, and a red
baseball cap and surrounded by my small horde of beautiful children.  Oh
yeah, limping because I'm sore all over from pulling my '77 motor
yesterday.
