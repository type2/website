Subject: THE BEAM IS OFF!

Geez, what a job this is! First, I want to thank Pete who e-mailed me to
tell me about the clutch cable. Well, I thought he was wrong, the clutch
cable goes over top of the beam. When I removed the last bolt and let the
jack down, guess what? The drivers side was hanging up on something-the
clutch cable! &amp;%$#*&amp;^! I had no choice at this point but to cut it
(carefully)to free up the beam. But, it's off now and that's a relief.
Removing the MC/booster wasn't all that difficult, however I found I had to
remove the left tie rod to get the clearance to pull it out. After two days
of this, I'm exhausted. I ache from head to toe and my hands hurt, not only
from the work, but from the scrubbing they have needed at the end of the
day to get the grease off. I think I'm going to take this week &quot;off&quot; from
VW bus repair!   Jeff S.
