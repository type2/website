Subject: Re: [T2] Just a thought about holidays

I once visited a web site that was dedicated to vacation swaps. Don't
recall it's name now, but it's purpose was free vacationing.

 John, you say, &quot;...the swaps tend to include vehicles...&quot; and I am not sure
 that is necessarily the case.  I guess it's a matter of where you draw the
 line.  While it would of course be more economical not to rent a car, there
is
 the matter of liability in case of accident.  I think that exchanging cars
as
 well as living accommodations would worry most people who own a house
and car --
  certainly it would worry hell out of me.  Probably a better idea is to work
 out reciprocal guest arrangements: A visits B for a week, then B visits A at
 some time later.

&gt; Does anybody else find this remotely appealing and/or have any ideas on how
 could it be made to work?
