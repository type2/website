&gt;Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I am seeking advice regarding types of lubricants, sealers etc involved
during the assembly process.  Any warnings, tricks and tips anyone has that
might not be covered clearly in the mighty manuals would be greatly
appreciated.  

Make sure you use a good cam lube.  Type 4 cams are better than early ones,
but they're still prone to wear when new.
