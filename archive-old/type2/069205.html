Subject: discontinued typeIV muffler

Hi,
        The early type IV (72-73) had a muffler where the tail pipe
exited the center.  Bentley says VW discontinued it and replaced it
with a muffler where the tail pipe goes out the side.  Well, a local
FLAPS has a bunch of the &quot;center&quot; types in stock.  For $120 new, and
the tail pipe (that needs to be ordered) is around $16.  That's $100
less than the newer ones.  Were these any louder then the
replacements?  Quieter than the header/monza type thing?  Since I need
a new muffler I figure I'll get one of these (assuming they can
actually get the tail pipe) instead and save the dolars.    

As an aside, I went to three places before I found a FLAPS that not
only agreed stem seals existed, but that they could get some.  Makes a
total engine newbie a little nervous!  Hopefully back on the road by
Turkey day:)

take care,
        brandy
