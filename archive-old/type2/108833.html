 I think the originals are sheet metal screws with a 10mm hex head.

&gt;yes, this is right. they have a captive washer also.

 Sheet metal screws?  Excuse me?  Mine are machine screws, not sheet metal screws.  Maybe this is just a
terminology conflict.  To me, sheet metal screws have very large, deep threads (similar to wood screws, but
cover the entire screw) and a sharp point at the end and are NOT meant to be threaded into nuts.  They are not
designed to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly.  Am I wrong?

Yes and no, depends on the year of the bus. Early bays used machine screws [bolts] and flat washers, part
numbers N 010 210 7 and N 011 666 10.  They were 6x1.0x10
Later bays used hex head tapping screws, part number N 013 890 5. They were 6.3x13
Hex head tapping screws look like sheet metal screws, but do not have a sharp point.
I do not know the year break, but I do know 76 and up used them. They have a 10mm head.
