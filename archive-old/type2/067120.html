Subject: Re: Corvairs - was Chinese type-2's

During my misspent youth I worked summers painting street lines, putting up
signs, digging dirt, etc. for the local town. The head line painter guy and
I drove around in an old police dept. Greenbriar van. It was painted black
and white on top, said &quot;Longport Police Dept.&quot; on the side, and even had
working siren and police lights. The engine was in a hatch in the floor in
the middle of the engine compartment. It must have been from the early
60's, and was garage kept. I think it would be quite a collector's piece
nowadays, but, alas, its current whereabouts are unknown :( (they traded it
in for a Ford pickup). Did VW make a similar police truck to go with the
fire truck/ambulance/etc.?

Also, a friend of mine at work is from mainland China. I gave him a ride in
my '66 the other day and he said that, in China, a very similar van was
made, but he didn't have any other details. He said it wasn't as ornate as
a VW on the inside (he was very impressed that my bus has an ashtray). :)

&gt;Also in interesting news:  I think it a fair statement that the Corvair was
&gt;an attempt by GM to emulate the bug, right?  Anyway, they didn't stop at
&gt;the bug.  Did you know there is an air-cooled, small van/bus thing called a
&gt;Corvair something or other?  A very bizarre vehicle indeed.

Yes, I think it was called a Greenbriar or something.  THere was a van and
pickup.
