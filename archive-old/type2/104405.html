Subject: Re: [T2] Nashville area Machine Shop?

Hi Jennifer,

Sam Dwiggens of Alternative Import (615.292.2401) is the man.  I've been 
using him for about 2 years on my VWs and he is excellent and best of all 
CHEAP!!!! He's great on both the aircooled and watercooled stuff.

Actually his brother does the engine work and he's great.

Tell him Daniel refered you, i could use the brownie points.

&gt;I have a 1972 westy. :)
&gt;I need to bring engine parts to be washed, the crank to be reground, the
&gt;heads for a valve job, the lifters to be reground, etc.
&gt;I'm looking for a good machine shop that knows about ACVWs?  Who do you
&gt;recommend?
