&gt; I haven't checked it out yet but will have a look tonight after work. I am
&gt; wondering if this is a simple job, that one can bear in the cold rain in a
&gt; city car park, or if I should abuse my gearbox a bit and drive it either home
&gt; or straight to the mechanic....

I have replaced clutch cables:
    in a MacDonalds parking lot;
    under the shadow of the Rockie Mountains; (my recommended best place)
    beside Interstate 95 in a raging blizzard; (&quot;     &quot;     *WORST*  &quot;  )
and a half a dozen other places too mundane to mention.

&gt;
&gt; The PO left me with a spare cable of some kind - so I am hoping it is for the
&gt; clutch :-)

If it is ~4mm dia., it is a clutch cable (90%), if it is ~1mm it is a
throttle cable (90%).  If that PO included a new clevis pin with the
cable, I recommend you write to Rome and nominate him for sainthood.  In
either event, you should have a spare for both cables (a clevis would be
nice too, but...) in the car at all times.

&gt;
&gt; Any tips or traps that are not in the standard manuals would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.
&gt;

First, it is a very straightforward job.  You can do it.  There, if the
attendant is understanding.  I would recommend that you replace the clevis
pin at the front and inspect the lever arm in the front and the
boudin tube (the flexible tube at the back) closely for possible
replacement.  If this is the first time you have done this job, a pair of
cable cutters can be helpful :-)  Lastly, the secret to a long lasting
clutch cable is GREASE! and lots of it.  Especially at the clevis pin and
in the cable guide tube.  My cables began to last a lot longer after I
started to smack a big glob of waterproof boat-trailer bearing greese on
the front end of the cable.
