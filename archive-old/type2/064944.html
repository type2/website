Subject: Speedo Cable Lube

I know I should know, but what is the proper speedo cable lube?
Muir, Bentley, and Haynes all leave this to our imaginations.
In the old days, one could pull the cable out from the sheath and 
grease it.  The newer ones are one piece.  I lubed mine with oil by 
filling the end up and letting time do it's thing of SLOWLY going 
down the sheath.  It took about an hour, but it doesn't make noises
anymore!
