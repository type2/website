&gt;Ok, my starter is turning too SLOW to start. I'm about to pop in a new
&gt;battery and new cables. Somewhere I read that the ground strap on the
&gt;Tranny may be loose.

It's a braided cable and it rusts out over time like the original battery negative cable.

&gt;I'm wondering if it would be advantagous to get a
&gt;negitive battery cable with two leads. One lead to the chasis where
&gt;it's at by factory default, and one line to the engine/tranny for
&gt;direct ground to the battery.

The path the current takes during starting is:

battery pos -&gt; starter -&gt; transmission case -&gt; tranny strap -&gt; body -&gt; battery neg

The current is only going to take one path (the one of least resistance) but both cables are going to rust out...
