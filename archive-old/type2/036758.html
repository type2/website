&gt; re there any household tricks to removing

&gt; 
&gt; i've tried every method of prying, punding, tapping,

&gt; there isn't enough penetrant in the world i think, 
&gt; not that it's especiallyrusty.

I used a Chevy pitman arm puller with a homemade adapter to neck it down
for the VW shaft.  It was still a bear to get off.  See the archives for
the gory details.

&gt; there also seems to be a cylinder around the pilot
&gt; shaft in teh '71's tranny. the pressure plate
&gt; on that engine is one with many small spring loaded
&gt; points aiming towards the center [kennedy?], the '68 pressure
&gt; plate [new] is teh three spring points, with a doughnut
&gt; in the center.  is there going to be any problem with
&gt; clearances, and if there is a possiblity, how can i measure
&gt; to be sure?

Yes there will be, and it can cause damage if you mix clutch parts.  Since
you have the new style transmission and throwout bearing, you should get
the new style pressure plate (no ring to match throwout bearing) to match.
If you want to go the other way,
you have to remove the sleeve and replace the cross-shaft and throwout
bearing with old-style parts.
