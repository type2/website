        Chris,
        My biggest problem with storage is dust, followed by moisture.
        Bearing type surfaces, once coated thoroughly with appropriate
grease, should be fine IF stored in a dust-free environment. Zip-lock
bags for example. Remember how much time Muir spends on putting parts
in labelled Baggees(tm)? keeps things organized AND no worse than
when you started.
        I suppose a box that closes or a cabinent with a door would
work about as well.

        Polyethylene bags are NOT vater-vapor proof, so grease or
something is required before bagging the parts. Mylar is seems pretty
vapor-tight, but I've not seen a good way to seal mylar bags, other
than tape. Effective, but not convenient for oft'interupted work.

        Besides the appropriate grease, WD-40 would be an obvious choce
to coat in-process parts. Pistons, heads and cases are aluminum or 
an aluminum alloy, so moisture driven corrosion isn't a huge deal. 
Cranks, rods, valves, cams, rockers, flywheels, etc are unpainted steel 
and need something. I've heard stories that Rolls-Royce simply keeps
steel and iron parts immersed in kerosine between machining operations
and until assembly.
        I've heard of by not used 'assembly lube', a grease specificly
for engines being assembled. Perhaps this would make a good protective
grease for cranks/rods/valves/etc. Bob Hoover, anyone else?

        Bill
