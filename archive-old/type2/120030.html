Subject: Re: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

YES!  You hit the nail on the head.  That was my other reason that I
forgot.  These engines are so prone to head problems (valves, seats, etc)
that constantly checking the valves and noticing large variances can give
you the head's up before it's too late.

&gt;funny thing is with hydraulic, you CANT check the valves. No
&gt;indication for you if you have a slowly dropping valve, or a valve
&gt;stem stretching. So even if you were so inclined and built your new
&gt;engine w/ hyd you could not check them :(
