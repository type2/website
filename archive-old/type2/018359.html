      Or yet another scenario --- for T1 engines:

     Your fan belt gets a little loose -- not enough to make the
alternator idiot light come on, but just enough on a real hot day,
pulling some long uphills in the mountains, to cook the engine pretty
well since your fan isn't turning as fast as it should.
     Of course, if you're really *in touch* with your bus, you'll just
intuit whenever there's a problem like this, and pull over and fix it.
Right?
