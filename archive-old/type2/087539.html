Subject: Runs Rotten After Fueling??

1974 Bus (1800cc) with 115k. Distributor vacuum diaphram went bad so 
I replaced the vacuum advance with a vacuum only unit rather than the 
original vacuum/retard unit.

Van runs OK with the minor problem of a rare backfire. Could be 
timing or idle setting now 1000 rpm.

Here is the strange part. I drove around town this morning and pulled 
into the gas station. Starting with a third tank of gas I fill the 
tank putting in 10 gallons. Immediately, the car will not run. It 
takes a long time to begin firing and then it immediately dies.

I run the battery flat trying to get it running. Gas is coming out 
the exhaust. Clearly flooded. We quick charge the battery. Finally it 
starts but runs terribly. By taking a long route home, I avoid 
stopping and letting the engine disengage until I get home. A couple 
of times the engine just looses power and nearly dies. Then it 
regains some power, never very much.

It has done this act twice before when I have filled the tank.

I have checked the floats in both carbs and they seem OK.

Any suggestions will be most welcome. I hope you have never 
encountered this strange problem.

Thanks.

Herb
