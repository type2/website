Correct, the ecu controls the time the injecter is open, not the pressure.
BUT the ecu has NO idea of the AMOUNT of fuel going thru the injecter. More
pressure = more volume. The ecu only tells the injecter how long to stay
open. If you have low pressure, you will have low volume going thru the
injecter for a given open period. If you have high pressure, you will have a
higher volume going thru the injecter for the same given open period.

&gt; Too much pressure to the injectors should not be a problem as long as the
&gt; injectors are not leaking.  The brain determines the length of time that
the
&gt; injectors remain open, not the amount of pressure. Take a good look at
your
&gt; cold start injector for leakage and proper operation. (thermo-time switch
&gt; operation)
