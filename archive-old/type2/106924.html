&gt; He tried to fight it with flour as he was parked in front of a restaurant
supply store. Not successful.

Once a month is a good schedule for checking those fire extinguishers.  It
even helps to add a small stocking tag to the handle so that you can mark
the dates you examined the extinguisher.

A word on four as a fire suppressant.  Probably not a good idea.  Dry flour
finely dispersed in the air can be a &quot;fuel/air bomb&quot; waiting for an ignition
source.

Then again, if my baby were on fire and flour was the only thing at hand,
we're making biscuits!!!
