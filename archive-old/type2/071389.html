Subject: HELP! me help a stranded 81 camper
Message-ID: &lt;d5931d8.2481d3ed_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

A fellow came to my work place today. He heard I was the local &quot;Bus guy&quot; and 
needed help. He is stranded just across the state line in North Carolina.

History: He was up here many months ago and fried the points somehow. No 
parts available and had to leave the bus and hitch home. He now is back and 
has replaced the points and she idles fine but (his description) &quot;bucks and 
sputters&quot; at anything above 20-25 miles per hour. Who knows how the points 
were set.
 
Sounds fuel related? Anyway, if it aint a 1600 upright, I am not much help. 
Know nothing about FI. Supossed to be a stock setup. Might be coil related? 
My 71 did something like that once. Will one of my coils work?

At any rate, am going to drive over the mountain in the morning and drive it 
so may be able to give a better description tomorrow. Anything obvious to 
check? Please if you respond with any FI stuff, tell me how to check and 
where it is! :-) It will have to be obvious or he will remain sitting.

Just trying to help another brother bus owner.

Marv, wanna come help?
