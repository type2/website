Subject: Help with FireWagon fix 

Volks:  I thought I sent this, but didn't see it in the digest.
       My apolgies if it is a repeat.
       Well I've done a few days of Forensic-Pyro-Archeaology on the 
      of FireBus. Its like trying to piece together an airplane crash!
     I have most of the fuel and air handling components out now.
    Most are quite melted. Some were removed with the shop vac:-0
   The distributor is under a pile of goo! I'll look for it tommorrow.
  Now I have a few questions. It is a 76 2.0l FI engine.

1. Under the air distributor is a thing that looks like a temperature
   sensor, or a short electric water heater element. What is this?
   What does it do?

2. Between the mystery part above, and the crankcase vent box, there
   is a small metal bracket bolted onto the block immediately behind the
   crankase vent box. It was covered in melted plastic. What is it?

3. How do I get the distributor out? As I have to mine down into a fairly
   large glob of melted plastic (Mount Distributor;-)), I'd like to know 
   where to mine to to get the distributor out.

4. As I reassemble it, I'll need to do some debugging as well. Is it possible
   to get it running on a minimum set of equipment?
   I was thinking that the following aren't really required to get the 
   engine started in warm weather: EGR valve, Throttle Switch, Aux Air Regulator
   Cold Start Valve, Thermal Time Switch, one of the temp sensors (not head temp
   one.), Decel Valve. If I plug the appropriate hoses, holes, and leave 
   these parts disconnected, should I be able to start the engine in warm
   weather? I'd like to be able to do this for two reasons: Simplify number
   of parts involved in initial debugging. Add these systems one at a time
   once I get it running. I know there is something wrong with one of the parts 
   Chris is sending me, but don't know which, hence the desire to do 
   incremental debugging.

5. I'm geting a 79 FI kit from Chris Kent, and am wondering which parts 
   are compatible with a 76 system? What are the differences? I list what I 
  think are different, but could be wrong?
- -Air Cleaner &quot;Nose&quot;                ? 
- -Air Cleaner Body                  ? 
- -Air Cleaner Filter                Doesn't matter much. Local, cheap
- -Air Flow Sensor                   76 6 pin - 79 7 pin? 
- -Intake Air Duct to throttle body  =
- -Throttle Body                     76 Electric EGR - 79 Mechanincal EGR
- -Throttle Switch                   = VW dealer only has one part number?
- -Cold Start Valve                  = from Bosch web page 
- -Thermo Time Switch                = from Bosch web page
- -Decel Valve                       = from Bosch web page
- -Aux Air Reg                       = from Bosch web page
- -Fuel Injection Wiring Harness     NO - Air Flow Sensor different # pins?
- -Ignition Distributor              ?     
- -Any hose, pipe differences        ?
- -Temp Sensor I                     ?
- -Temp Sensor II                    ?
- -Double Relay                      = from Bosch web page


Other parts I need if people happen to have them
- -Heater Fan 
- -Heater Fan connecting hoses
- -Heater Fan Right Side Plastic Duct to engine tin
- -Unknown Little Melted Relay that was mounted with heater fan? What is this?
- -Crankcase breather box.
- -Cooling Fan Screen
- -Engine Flap Weather Stripping
- -Rear Hatch Handle (Plastic Part)
- -Diagnostic plug
- -little Boards full of round holes that form the ceiling of the engine 
 compartment, and hold up the insulation
- -Wiring harness that crosses back roof of engine compartment to the left
 tailight?

6. While I have all the FI stuff removed, I plan to pull the firewall and
   fix the fuel lines on the tank too. Can I do this without pulling the tank?
   Can I pull the tank with the engine in?
   Is there any other maintainance, checking I should do while I have
   all this stuff removed?

7. Does anyone have a list, or copy of a fiche that has the part numbers
   for all the parts above for 76, or 79. Especially for all the plastic
   plumbing fittings that have melted. Also a photocopy of a picture would
   be useful to help with assembly

Please e-mail, as I don't get all of the digest.

Thanks
