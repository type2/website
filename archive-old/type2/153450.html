&gt; quoth Tom Young:
&gt; The other thing that comes to mind is an over-rich fuel setup which is a 
&gt; consistent problem with the older AFM FI rigs.  The spring inside the AFM 
&gt; weakens over time leading to an over-rich mixture at all speeds and RPMs. 
&gt; This, too, will frequently result in the hesitation you describe....
&gt;
&gt; This begs the question- a  NEW AFM then should require more push to open 
&gt; the AFM flapper than an old worn weaker one- does anyone know what force 
&gt; is required in a NEW AFM to push it open?  If this were known, then 
&gt; adjusting the spring to proper tension should be possible? Or perhaps a 
&gt; compensating resistor could be put in series with the circuit to the ECU?

I don't know that anybody knows what torque is necessary to move the flapper 
a given distance from its rest position, but many folks - me included - have 
had good sucess with tightening the spring and monitoring the results with 
the O2 sensor.  Lots of posts in the archives on the procedure.
