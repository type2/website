Subject: re: brake master cyl res hose

i couldn't find any stock replacement hose either for the res to master 
cyl...my problem was the rubber grommets that fit inside the ends had 
cracked and all the fluid was leaking out, into the cab...i solved the 
problem by using vinyl hose from a local hardware store (Ace)..i think it 
was 1/4&quot;,it was a tight fit on the res...i was leary that the brake fluid 
might dissolve it but after a year no leaks and looks fine...they have this 
stuff in bulk and you cut to whatever length you want..
