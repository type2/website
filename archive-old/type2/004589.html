Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Trailer Hitch?

List, Blake,

I personally use and abuse a Jamie Rivers trailer hitch and I will vouch for
its perfect fit, super strong construction and with the removable receiver,
its barely visible. Jamie did a great job and his price is WELL worth it.
This hitch is the quality of, if not better, then the Reese and Hidden Hitch
styles we all see. AND, as Jamie said, it bolts into the existing bus with
NO modification.

Have a look for yourself! You wont be dissapointed....

Hi Blake

I have a couple of Hitches available, you can see the 74 Vw Bus style here
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/hitch.htm

There is a receiver style available that will accept a 1 1/4&quot; or a 2&quot;
receiver
,for any standard size ball, bicycle carrier, or what ever,,  I don't have
pictures yet
You know the type that the tongue is removable with a pin and the bike rack
is
inserted,,,

they both mount on the Vw the same,, right to the frame, *above* the
bumper,,
you unbolt the bumper, install the hitch and rebolt the bumper and the hitch
as
a sandwich,,
you do NOT have to modify the bumper at all,
this is a very strong style of hitch and does not interfere with the muffler
replacement
Black outdoor powder painted

They are u.s. $120 ea. + $30 shipping UPS  2-6 weeks delivery depending.
the receiver style are u.s. $140 + same shipping
I take paypal, CANADIAN postal order, cheque ,,

I am not a business, I wait for the cheque to clear the bank before shipping
They will be shipped from Southern Ontario CANADA

&gt; I have some photos of one, so I know it can be made.  I have a friend who
&gt; owns one, but the idiot welders around here refuse to duplicate it for me.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have one to sell, or know of a place that will make one?
