Subject: GOODIES!

My VW buddy here in town is cleaning house. Make that garage - two of them!
Basically, I made him a deal; I'll give you guys first shot, then hit the
web. In return, I get to pick a few things out for my busses (like old,
indestructible steel generator pulleys - yum!).  He's been
racing/building/fixing volksies for 30 or so years, so...   Email me with
want lists, and we'll start there. Other stuff will follow as we make
lists. Fer instance, there is a box of 70's-era VDO gauges IN THE BOX; he
plans to let stuff like that go for ~$30_at_. An EMPI steering wheel (bug I
think), NEW 36HP cranks, cases, all kindsa weird crap. I will vouch
completely for this guy: if he says something works, it does; if he charges
$50, it's prolly worth $90. Damn good mechanic, too, but his health ain't
too good lately, so....
