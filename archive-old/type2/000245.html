Late last year, I ordered a new front bumper for mrwhipy &amp; a revering light
kit, rear lens, seals for rear lenses &amp; seals for front indicators. Bill
came to just under £100 with shipping, not too bad. Took a couple of weeks
to arrive due to stock but the bits came wrapped I thought inside the bubble
wrapped bumper. Today well over a month latter I was ordered to remove the
bumper from the lounge :) by my
 trouble 'n' strife &lt;grin&gt;. Decided to remove the items wrapped inside while
the bumper was stored in the bus. All I found was a front window rubber for
a '50-'67 split &quot;OH SH$T!&quot; I thought. Since the order was almost 2 months
old I was WELL stuffed, no chance they would send me the other items as it
was my error not to check the delivery. I phoned them just in case &amp; was
told &quot;Very sorry, we'll send the other items out tomorrow!&quot; what about the
split seal? &quot;keep it&quot;. So now I'm well pleased. Any one need a 4' rubber
band?
