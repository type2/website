Michael,
   I had this same problem last April, while on the way to Everybus 2000.  
You are thinking along the right track in thinking fuel problems.  Screwed 
into the bottom of your fuel tank, right at the outlet, there is a filter 
screen.  Well, after 30 years of never being cleaned, it gets clogged up to 
the point where not enough gasoline is getting to the engine.
   The best thing to do would be remove the gas tank, flush it, seal it, and 
reinstall it with a new screen in it.  I didn't have that option, so what I 
did was to remove the old screen, run about 5 gallons of alcohol through the 
tank to flush it while still installed, install a new screen and seals, 
replace all fuel lines along with a new in-line filter.  Then check the 
in-line filter daily as it will be picking up the loosened dirt from the 
tank as it comes out.  I had to change that filter every week for about a 
month.
   To find this filter screen, just follow your fuel line back to the tank.  
The screen will be the hex right there where the fuel line hose is attached. 
  It screws out in the normal fashion.
