Subject: Re: [T2] trying to do my rear brakes and need help!

&gt;I'll get zapped for saying/writing this, but...
&gt;
&gt;Avoid any tire store that doesn't tighten your lug nuts with a torque
&gt;wrench, using factory specified torque values.  And you shouldn't have to
&gt;ask, it should be their standard procedure.

Couldn't agree more, I had my wife's Honda Civic done by a regional chain
and the brakes warped shortly after. I broke a breaker bar trying to remove
a lug so I brought it back. the counter guy flatly denied responsibility,
said it was impossible because they use a clutch on their air guns. I
showed him the broken breaker bar and he agreed to look at it. he brought
out a brand new 1/2 inch torque wrench and broke it. He started apologizing
then. Apparently the tech picked up an air tool without a clutch on it and
went to town.

They ended up replacing the discs and drums due to distortion Fortunately
the bearing races survived.
