Thanks for all the advice, everyone! It was *extremely* helpful. I called
around today and finally found a Les Schwaab who had the 185R14's in with 8
ply. I paid about $330 for all of them, and that's with warranty and
installation. The bus runs so much nicer now. 

I really appreciate all the information that was sent to quickly. My next
tire/wheel project will be to have the wheels sandblasted and painted.
