&gt; I just saw a red and white 1964 21 window go for $41,000 at The RM Classic
&gt; Car Auction in Monterey CA. The show aired at 11am Sunday, Feb. 18.
&gt;
&gt; That bus looked enough like my 76 Westy to claim at least brother or
&gt; sisterhood.  For years I have believed that my bus is a very worthy
&gt; vehicle, and I'm keeping it in good shape because I enjoy driving it now
&gt; and then. I've owned it since the 80's. Much like this forum, the auction
&gt; reinforces my hope/belief that I'm not irrationally eccentric and some kind
&gt; of nut. I might even have a good financial investment.
&gt;
   Dream on...That was an auction...Prices at those &quot;events&quot; are wildly
divergent from prices of real cars...Unless it's a vehicle that was rare
to begin with, those prices don't translate to what YOUR vehicle might
be worth...Check prices on the online auction site for comparables...
and see if even they actually sell...You can ask whatever you want for
anything...
    Besides, how much do you think the seller already has spent on that
$41,000 VW...Including the trailer (it sure wasn't driven to the auction)
and garaging (it doesn't see sunshine much less snow...?-)
