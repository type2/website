Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel
  pump in  1600DP

 I use a little more flexible fuel line than needed between the tank and engine..   
That way I can pull the motor off the trans, pull it slightly back, drop it down a bit, and reach over the motor and 
 
undo the fuel line from ABOVE
 
which keeps it from dripping on me at all.   :)   YAY!

Jules, 
 
Actually, I have started doing this to almost all of my VW's with the exception of my 78 bus. 
 
I got sick and tired of having gasoline running down my arms and into my eyes and being a potential fire hazard. It didn't seem to matter whether I had a good clamp on either end or not as there is always some residual 
gas in the lines.
