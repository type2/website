&gt; &gt;Someone e-mailed me a warning on the Cooper
&gt; tires lawsuit so be careful on them:
&gt;
&gt; Being sued doesn't mean anything.  How many
&gt; zillions of times was VW sued after Nader
&gt; declared them all unsafe?  Being sued means some
&gt; plaintiff attorney paid enough to get a college
&gt; professor &quot;expert&quot; somewhere to say his stats
&gt; suggest they are unsafe, nothing more.  Money
&gt; talks.  EVERY SINGLE TIRE MANUFACTURER, AUTO
&gt; MANUFACTUER, AND PRODUCER OF CUSTOM VAN PARTS
&gt; currently has many suits against them.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

Correct me if I am wrong but.....a suit means someone is suing someone and the
court has not acted on it.
Now if a 'proposed settlement' is offered....isn't that past the 'file a suit'
that 'being sued' implies?
If so, then you should read this:

Notice the BIG words across the top of the site? COOPER TIRE SETTLEMENT........
