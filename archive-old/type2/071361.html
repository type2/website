Message-ID: &lt;d23ef617.249d6c71_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

to all who are interested...i was making my rounds of the local slavage 
yards, and saw a 74 van.  has a lot left on it.

missing rear and middle seats.  virtually everything else there.  it has the 
original aluminium strips around the tops of all the windows to hang 
curtains.  

i know the year and all is not a *find*..but i hate to see them crushed...so 
i thought i d let you all know.  

its at u-pull it on 11th and grace st., omaha, ne.   prices are cheap here!!
