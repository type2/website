Howdy all. A friend of mine has a pretty nice '74 Westy that he needs to sell
to finance work on his splitty. Body-wise it's in pretty good shape, and
mechanically it's pretty sound, other than the fact the engine is now
completely torn down. We started to rebuild it following its seizure, and then
he decided to buy a splitty when it came up. All the parts are there, however.
It's a project, but at $600 HIGHLY negotiable, it's a great place to start for
a wannabusser. He is very motivated to sell, as he needs the space and money
for the new bus. It's in Raleigh NC. E-mail me for more details.
Thanks,
