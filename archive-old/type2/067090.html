Subject: Where I Live

I live in Wichita, Kansas (biggest city in Kansas proper, pop. 300,000)

I Drive a 69 Westfalia camper (sorry no web page yet)

The bus is named &quot; The Funky Turtle &quot;( My jazz band students named it 
after a 1970 Jazz chart, I bought it while we were working on that tune 
and it seemed to make sense.)

I am 33 yrs old but still in High School.
