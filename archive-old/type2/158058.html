Subject: Re: [T2] Pics of the dangers of a front mounted spare

Right.

I agree to disagree, and agree to all of the above except a small
tap---whch I agree would dent just as much as wthout.

Now in a big bump--

Nobody wins.

You'd think that all the allegid noble heads would ave added a bulkhead
behing that  front panel to suck up some shock waves prior to buckling
the whole nose--spare tire or not---

What in the hell did they have on their mind?

That bumper is only good till whatever your dealing with overrides it---

Then you and the Bus is doomed.
