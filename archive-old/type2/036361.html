Subject: RE: Ezee Brake bleeder kit from IPD

On the instructions for my brake bleeder it specifically says not to exceed
20 psi.  You should be able to get away with a lot less pressure than this,
but the rear brakes may need a little more because they are further away.

&gt; What I would be afraid of is the chance of blowing the 
&gt; reservoir or the
&gt; lines to the master cylinder.  they weren't designed to take 
&gt; pressure, and
&gt; 30-year-old plastic isn't known for its resiliance!
