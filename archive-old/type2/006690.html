Guys,
I also need a knob on the dash which would give me intermittent wiper
control, as well as speed of wipers... can some one help?
Is there a kit available, or can I buy this ready made? Or can it be done?

Also... I have just got the latest &quot;idiot&quot; manual, and I think I found an
anomaly...
The problem is I think I have a dirty tank, and the dirt and crud has been
deposited into my [DUAL] Solex carbies, making the van 1800 motor run
roughly.
(I'd NEVER have known this, if I hadn't read the book. I'm not a mechanic!)

On page 431, in the 18th manual (1999 edition), under Tune-ups, John Muir
mentions that 1972 buses and on, had hydraulically operated valves, meaning
of course that one doesn't have to manually set the valve clearances...
however, on page 97, same book, under Procedures for Valve Adjustments, it
says that 1978 and on buses have non-adjustable hydraulic valves.  Is this a
typo? Or is this correct?
