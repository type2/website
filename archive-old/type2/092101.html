Subject: one motor, two buses

Any of you multiple bus owners out there use one motor for more than one
bus?  I'm planning on putting the 1600dp rebuilt 7,000 miles ago into
the 65 to get it registered. I then came on the idea that maybe for a
couple two tree years, I would swap the motor and drive the other bus.
Odd years splittie, even bay, etc.  I would only be driving them
May-Oct, putting about 4,000 miles a year.  Maybe do the same with
wheels too?  It would definitely give me something to look forward to,
and maybe each bus would last twice as long :) But is it feasible?

Just a thought,

don
