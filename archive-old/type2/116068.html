&gt; Sorry.  Kind of long.  I seek technical advice on what to do.
&gt; 
&gt; My rebuilder will include whatever size new P&amp;C I want at one price, and can
&gt; do all but bore allign a Type IV case, i. e., open the heads; open the case.
&gt; He sends out the crank to the mid west somewhere.

Use 94mm P&amp;C's and the 77 bottom and build a 2 litre motor. There is no
opening up needed, it will all fit.  Make sure to use a new cam and lifters,
preferably web cam.
&gt; 
&gt; He is more interested in doing a good job than making money.  Over 28 years
&gt; rebuilding VW engines and still not rich.
&gt; 
&gt; Costs:
&gt; 
&gt; What ever way I go, the rebuild price is $1,150 plus a small extra for fly
&gt; cut, open case, open heads. Includes new valves, guides, and new P&amp;C

Like I said, there is no fly cut, no open case, it all fits. The heads
should be rebuilt in any case.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The 1.7 is in my garage.  Cost zero.  The kicker:  the wife wants me to get
&gt; the '72 1.7 running and sell it.  I can do that for about $100.


I assume this project motor is for another bus?
Keep the 1.7 for the 72.

&gt; 
&gt; The 1.8 will cost $150, but I get decent heat exchangers and muffler setup,
&gt; but no carbs [I have two sets of 32 - 34 PDSIT 2/3].

I am not a fan of those carbs on a 2 litre motor, but you might be able to
make them work. Try to get a working FI system. You might still have tin
issues with all this mixing and matching, so be prepared for that.
