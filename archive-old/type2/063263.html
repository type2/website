        Chris,
        Pistons are aluminum so just dust-free is fine, but rods
also need balancing and are steel and have oil passages. This is
where I'd try plain motor oil or assembly lube, and then squeeze 
the air out of the bag before zipping it shut. A surface film
of motor oil in a closely confinging bag ought to be good for
rust-prevention for weeks if not longer. I'll start an experiment
in a week or so and report if it ever flashes rust.
        My untested hypothesis is that that saran wrap is overkill.
If you reall want to keep it tight, fold the bag around the part
and then use a few rubber bands. 

        Cheers!
        Bill
