Subject: Original license plates

After seeing some of the older model type IIs at the VW Jamboree in Costa
Mesa this weekend I had a question concerning license plates I hope someone
could answer.  I saw quite a few vehicles with the original (black on yellow)
California license plates.  Did these people just get increadibly lucky and
purchase their resto projects with the original plates?  Or is there a way to
go through the DMV to get the original plate re-issued?  It seems like
re-issuing original plates would be next to impossible but states do seem to
be printing different variety of plates these days and maybe that's a new
option I'm not aware of.
