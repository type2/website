Subject: Re: [T2] new vs. rebuilt

I will second that. I have a long block from NW Connecting Rod in my 77
Westy. It started leaking form the push rod tubes at about 10k miles after
install. I took it back to them and absolutely no hassle. It has not leaked
since.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I'd like some help deciding on a Brazillian / Mexican new engine vs. a

&gt;
&gt; It depends completely on who rebuilds the engine as to whether you will
get
&gt; better specs from the rebuild as opposed to the south of the boarder new
&gt; spec. I know I would have more faith in my VW engine rebuilder than I
would
&gt; in a new Mex factory engine. He's a second generation VW machinist and
&gt; won't hex you with a junky GEX assembly, but Dad still hangs around the
&gt; shop so you have the knowledge of a Master Mentor in the whole history of
&gt; VW engines for backup and foundation. Instills very high confidence in the
&gt; work. Of the many long blocks from them that I have installed I've had no
&gt; problems at all but very few and minor issues jumped on and resolved
&gt; immediately. Superlative business ethics one on one, on it's own, is worth
&gt; a premium in my mind.
&gt;
&gt; Give NW Connecting Rod in Seattle a call and see what they can do for you.
&gt; Seek, and ye shall find. Tell Jerry I sent you.
