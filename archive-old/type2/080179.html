Subject: Ouch - Emergency body repair

Eh, crap, I turned too sharply around a newly squeezed in vehicle next
to mine in my driveway and have put a nice crease and broke the paint
below the slider and rear of the wheel well.  Not terribly bad, but...

No way I can afford taking it into a shop right now.  Can I sand/primer
myself to seal it up?  I know there's been lots of advice already on the
list, but so much I'm confused...

What should I do?  It's rusting already.

Thanks, all!

Teri
