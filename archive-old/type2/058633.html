Hi Volks....I'm taking the opportunity to alert you volksmates about a
really great camping happening in Maryland on Oct 2-4.  It is held in
St. Marys County; camping is at Point Lookout State Park (it's a
beautiful park.....the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River meet there).  

Glen Smith (the LIMBO Treasurer.....I believe) organizes this event. 
Last year was the first year and he put on quite an event.  There are
plenty of things to do (swimming, crabbing, boating, museums, historic
St. Mary's City, and a really fabulous outdoor flea market, just to name
a few).  Saturday night is a group crab dinner and Sunday is potluck
breakfast.

It is worth the trip (especially if you life in the mid-Atlantic area).

Glen isn't on the list so you can either call him (301.884.5461) or send
me a pmail for more info.

Bye.

Bob
