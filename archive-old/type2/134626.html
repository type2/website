Subject: Now it's gas in MY oil!

Any other explanations? Could fuel seep through a ruptured diaphram?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This happened to me in my 73 Thing.  Turned out to be a bad gasket at the base
of the fuel pump.
Replaced the gasket, problem solved.  Hate to say it, but you may have some
serious engine wear if you ran it for long with gas in the oil.
Mine smoked after it happened to me as a result of the cylinder walls being
washed with gas.
Mike
