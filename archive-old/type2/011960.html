i haven't seen the movie but i believe it is Jackie
Brown.  from what i have heard they have a brown
baywindow and they custom made the back window to roll
down just for the scene.  they should have had a 68-72
westy, popped the top and started firing, now that
would've been a cool scene.

&gt; I was watching a movie once where these hippy-types

&gt; rolled down the back window, and to a shot at him.
&gt; 
&gt; The Friday question is, was the roll-down back
&gt; window an actual option, or
&gt; was that just some Movie Magic?  By the way,
&gt; shooting at cops is dispicable.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides letting in noxious exhaust fumes, a roll
&gt; down window might be a
&gt; pretty cool thing.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody?
