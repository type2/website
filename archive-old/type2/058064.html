I'll be heading down to Manassas from Baltimore--don't know exactly when
yet.   I've got oodles of VW stuff (bus mostly) that I could part with;
however, I've pretty much decided I'm not up to getting a space to sell
stuff.  If you know what you're going to be looking for, feel free to
let me know, and I'll rummage around and see if I can find it.  Or
better, follow Patrick Flynn's example and let us all know.

Hasta Domingo,

Eric L. Forsman
