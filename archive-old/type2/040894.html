Subject: Re: Fuel Filter Saga

I had similar symptoms years ago with a 74/1800 whist touring in
France...bus would loose power &amp; I'd be limping along at 25-35MPH. I
remember frantically searching for the blue VW/Audi sign on a dealership and
would then try to explain problem to the French mechanics. By the time they
got to test the bus the problem always cleared.  I must have stopped in at
least 5 different garages/towns ......Plugs were always near white....timing
always spot on, valve lash okay too....

final solution, two in-line fuel filters and no more problems!
