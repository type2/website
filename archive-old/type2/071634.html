Looks like I am going to be moving to Germany for three years. Unfortunetly 
that is going to require me to get rid of my cars. 
My 1999 Jetta Wolfsburg is for sale now, and I'll sell the camper (or try to) 
right before i leave in the winter. After the Jetta goes, the camper will be 
primary driver for a while. 
So if there is anyone on the list who is the market for a 1999 Jetta 
Wolfsburg now, let me know, i'll be glad to send you all the info. 
And if there is anyone who may want a 71 westy in the winter...hold off, it's 
coming!
