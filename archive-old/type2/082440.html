Subject: RE: [T2] 68-79 on CD

&gt; I will bet that (Hey... Ron... BIG HINT coming :) one or more=20
&gt; of the list
&gt; vendors might well start carrying these at some discount off=20
&gt; the Bentley's
&gt; list price.  I kinda hope so, because I *know* I want both=20

Maybe that guy on eb*y who is pirating VW ETKA CDs will pick up
another title.  I can't believe VWoA (or SPA) hasn't crawled up his butt
yet.
