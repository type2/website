Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line 

&gt; Karl, how does the rubber line (which apparently I have, thank you) run from the tank to the fuel pump?
This line runs through the gap between the
engine metal and the firewall.

From your previous message, you say you have a carb? What happened to your fuel injection?
If you had FI, you would have a rubber hose going from the tank to the drivers side frame rail. There are 2
plastic clips mounted to the floor for the hose to sit in.
The 7.5mm hose goes to the filter, then a short piece of 10mm hose connects between the filter and the FI
pump. Then a short piece of 7.5 hose goes between the pump and the metal fuel rail connected to the 3/4
injectors.
If you have a modified fuel system, no one can tell you what you have unless they see it....
