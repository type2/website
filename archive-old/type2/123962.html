Subject: [T2] Fixing Type IV Head Leaks

&gt; Situation:
&gt; Bone stock '79 Westy, 2.0L with square-port heads.  So this weekend,
&gt; leakdown testing revealed compression leakage on cylinder No. 4, with
&gt; no leakage of air out of intake, exhaust or engine case.  It would
&gt; appear that the leakage is at the head to cylinder seal, since the air
&gt; can be heard and felt leaking in the vicinity of the pushrod tubes  [snip]

&gt; I intend to correct this problem, but do not yet have engine removed
&gt; from the bus so I don't know why this leakage occurred.  Recent
&gt; conventional wisdom on this list and elsewhare seems to indicate that
&gt; no head gaskets should be used upon assembly, and any shims required
&gt; for compression adjustment be installed at the bottom of the cylinder
&gt; barrels instead of at the head.  Am I correct in this assumption?  Also
&gt; I have the following questions:

As you know, these engines originally came from the factory with paper seals
at the bottom of the cylinder and head shims between the top of the cylinder
and the head.  VW changed this configuration - you have the URL - to
eliminate the top shim and put all shims below the cylinder.  I'd assume the
rebuilder supplied you with top shims so the engine wouldn't have to be torn
down too far to fix the issue at hand.  My GUESS - based on my own
experience - is that using top shims isn't the end of the world and many
engines served out their useful lives with these shims in place.  Probably
the later setup is somehow &quot;better&quot;, I'm just not sure how much better.

&gt; 1  If I use shims at the cylinder barrel/case joints to adjust
&gt; compression, where do I get these shims and how do you seal them
&gt; against oil leakage???  Do you put a paper gasket on each side of the
&gt; shim??  Currently the engine has NO oil leaks and I intend to keep it
&gt; that way.

Shims in a variety of thicknesses are available from the online vendors and
VWFLAPS.  Seal the shims with Permatex or something similar, no paper
gaskets.

&gt; 2.  What kind of treatment are the heads likely to require in order to
&gt; get them to seal properly?  Will the old trick of lapping the cylinders
&gt; to the head with valve grinding compound be adequate?

It depends on what you find in there when you pull the engine apart.  The
safest route is to get a compression cut on both sealing surfaces, with the
amount of material removed measured and compensated for with shims.


&gt; 3.  What is the most recent wisdom regarding re-torquing heads at some
&gt; point after the engine has been in service?  This was not done with
&gt; these heads and I am wondering whether re-torquing would have prevented
&gt; my situation.
&gt;
&gt; 4.  Are there any other precautions recommended to prevent reoccurrence?

Given the fact that there's no published specifications that I've ever found
that definitively set forth important dimensions on these engines such as
deck height and combustion chamber volume, and given that things get even
murkier when you're using remanufactured components, and since you're
committed to tearing down the engine to the extent of removing the
cylinders, I'd suggest cc'ing the heads and carefully measuring deck height
(no shims) and *calculating* what shims are needed to make the CR correct.
