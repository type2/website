&gt;Hello,
&gt;Most of you remember I am in the middle of a engine overhaul.
&gt;So I was thinking I should replace the old rusty nuts that hold
&gt;the cylinder heads on the studs.

There are copper nuts available that wouldn't rust - those would be my
first choice.  Whatever type you use, put lots of anti-sieze on the studs
before you install them and don't overtighten.  If you want to be sure you
don't have problems in the future, remove the nuts every year, clean
everything and reapply the anti-sieze.
