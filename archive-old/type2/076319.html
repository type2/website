Subject: Re: [T2] Push Button Starter

I've either parted out or resurrected about seven Westies/Vanagons in the
past five years. I always attempt to make them run before I decide to
crush or restore. Many of these vehicles have had more than eight owners
and I've seen additional solenoids, two switch ignition, combination of
ignition switch and a starter button. I'd highly recommend that you just
follow through the system and keep the OEM setup. Swap out the switch
from one of your other VWs or even the starter to run down the problem,
even with the double work you'll be better off than with cave man
methods.
If the starter turns the engine but you don't start, then test the thermo
time switch connection under your air intake box, noted for broken
connector box or hard gasket keeping it from contacting good.
Poorly installed temperature senders can also cause the problem (can also
have frayed wires that are hidden by the broken up insulation that I
often see).
I've seen this problem and POs of the dead vanagons I've bought have had
this problem and a work around is not a good solution.
I will accept the flack on this...... You don't need no stinking second
solenoid. Its a patch not a fix.
------------------------------
Here is the starting sequence:
Ignition key turned to starting position: Fuel Pump On/Cold Start
Injector On/Starter Motor On/Ignition Coil On/ECU On (other instruments
etc on)
Ignition key in run position: Fuel Pump Passed off to [ECU/AFM/Double
Relay] /Ignition Coil On/
So if you want to bypass that ignition switch you need to have a standard
ignition switch and a starter button.
That Vanagon Ignition switch fits a lot of VWs, not just Vanagons but a
lot of others as well. They are normally &quot;Gimmies&quot; at the wrecking yards
I go to as long as I've got $25.00 of other bigger stuff.
In addition the switch has a solder (fused) point in it that can be
repaired.
I've found the turn the key  = nothing to be loose push on connectors at
the starter or solenoid plunger locked by light coating of dust/grease
buildup.

&gt; Volks,
&gt; After a lot of testing/contemplation, I think I am going to rig a 
&gt; push button for my starter on my 81 vanagon.  It has the classic 
&gt; turn the key nothing syndrome.......I can put a rench between the 
&gt; battery lead and terminal 30(maybe 50) and it cranks right up....new 
&gt; solenoid, same result...different good starter, same 
&gt; result.............. Checked ignition switch seems 
&gt; fine................3rd time in 1 1/2 years, and i already have the 
&gt; Bosch wr-1 kit installed.  Rewiring is a possibility (seems to lose 
&gt; 1 volt from switch to starter on the starter end at the ignition 
&gt; switch lead. Prior to this last bout I had been popping fuses in the 
&gt; WR-1 relay kit.....15 amp ones.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there somewhere on the net that gives a how to?  Would like to 
&gt; have it work only when key is on, then mash button to engage.
