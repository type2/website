Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; 68 westy Emergency brake cables

The info below is taken from an original 1968 VW Dealership parts 
book. There is only one line drawing of the cable and the parts page 
has the three listed below in the same order. The is no reference to 
right of left side but there are two radically different lengths 
listed for early 68 model years. Only a 3mm decrease in size for mid 
year up to thru 1972 model years.  Usually VW part#s that are the 
same but have a letter at the end are revisions that supercede 
previous letters.  I still does not make sense. in this case. Maybe 
you cold use a string to make a mock up and then measure it.

211 609 701 H
Brake cable, rear wheel, 3438mm (135 11/32&quot;) to chassis 218 104 707

211 609 701 L
Brake cable, rear wheel, 3435mm (135 1/4&quot;)  from chassis 218 104 708

211 609 701 J
Brake cable, rear wheel, 3157mm (124 9/32&quot;) to chassis 218 104 707

&gt;Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt;I'm helping Adam Narraway get his 68 westy running so he can join TEAM
&gt;CANADA on the trip to Everybus this spring. His bus was a near basket case
&gt;when we started back in October, but it has come a long way since then and
&gt;now we just need to look after a few little things. Things like tires, wiper
&gt;motor, re-installing the interior, repairing canvas, etc.
&gt;
&gt;The most critical &quot;etc&quot; at the moment is the emergency brake. California
&gt;Import Parts (CIP1_dot_com) lists 3 cables for Bays, and two are for the 68
&gt;year. Busdepot_dot_com only lists one part fir the 68. Adams Westy is an early
&gt;68 baywindow without power-assisted brakes.
