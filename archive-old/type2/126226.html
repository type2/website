&gt;I was wondering 
&gt;if the kick panels were the same from '68 through '79, or if there were 
&gt;changes.   Cause I'm set up to make kicks like the ones I pulled out of a '77.   Do 
&gt;those work for all years?

The location of the brake fluid reservoir at least mean there are more than one kind.

Looking at BD's catalog there are 68-70 and 71-79 sets for sale.
