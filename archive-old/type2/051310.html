Subject: Re: [T2] broken windshield

&gt;That said, it was not worth it.  I would cut the seal on a bay.  The risk
&gt;vs. reward is not high enough to justify the excercise.  A new seal is
&gt;$20, a new windshield is at least $70 (I am more used to $100).  On a
&gt;V'gon, where the seal is $60 vs. new glass at $100, a case might be made,
&gt;of course...  (sorry, that was just ribbing John :-)

Hey I'm not the one who goes power braking with an extension ladder
sitting in my vanagon 8-)

To tell the truth I may have once pulled one as well, many moons ago
on the '76 I know I broke the glass trying, but it occurs to me that was
the second time around.  This was in about '86 or so and there were no
WCM bay window seals or I in WV didn't know about them and I had
paid VW like $65 for a new seal at the time.  It seems to me I did it
once then let the car set a year or so, and decided to go back and
do some more work and broke it the second time.  I used a smattering
of putty knives.

Ron wants $19.95 I see for a baywindow seal, everyone should just
cut the damn thing out at that price.

I think Steve may have a decent chance on the vanagon seal myself, but
the glass has a large rock chip in the center and it will be risky, as the
seal and glass are about the same value though, who knows.
