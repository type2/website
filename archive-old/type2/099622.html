Subject: Re: [T2] London to Sydney overland in VW Buses

&gt;Me and a group of friends are planning an overland trip from London to 
&gt;Sydney in a couple of VW Buses. We're currently looking for vehicles - 
&gt;ideally VW T4s - the later the better (1979) at any rate. We've found one 
&gt;that's perfectly suited - complete with Westfalia-Helsinki interior kit. 
&gt;It's an automatic though - would this be problematic in terms of 
&gt;repair/wear &amp; tear on the way. Ideas/theories/suggestions on the best type 
&gt;of vehicle to conduct this trip/offers of buses gratefully accepted. Cheers.

Who is going to fix it IF it fails? Auto boxes are pretty rare outside of 
1st world countries. Manuals are common. Plan for the worst.
