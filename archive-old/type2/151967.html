&gt; For those of us with only one jack, and access to a second one mid-morning, is
&gt; there a set height you can mount the bus at and remove the engine without
&gt; raising the body during the procedure?  Even if it means laying the engine
&gt; flat on the concrete?

I've found that the height of my drive up stands was adequate, probably
about 15 inches or so
