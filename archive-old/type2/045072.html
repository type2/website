Subject: [T2] d-jet / l-jet / buses

Just an FYI for any who are interested.  L-jet fuel injection was the only FI 
that VW ever used on the bus (from 75 - ??).  D-jet was used on the 411 and 412 
sedans as well as 70-76 914-4 1.7 and 2.0 (the 1.8 914 used l-jet).  Either 
system can be used on any type IV motor as long as all the components are used 
(ECU, distributor, sensors, etc.).

D-jet is an older, less sophisticated system than L-jet.  It is not readily 
adaptable to engine displacement changes so if you've got a 1.7 motor, you'll 
want the 1.7 brain, dizzy, MAP, etc.  Likewise for a 2.0.  It should also be 
noted that the vehicles that used d-jet were considerably lighter than a bus so 
the design and tuning of the system may not be ideally suited for use in a 4000 
pound bus.

All in all, unless you've already got tons of experience with d-jet (and a 
supply of spare parts), I'd recommend using and learning l-jet.
