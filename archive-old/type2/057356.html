Hello list,
Since I am about to purchase a oil temp gauge, I was wondering which one was
better, the drain plate sensor or the dipstick sensor.  I was hoping they were
bothe the same because the drain plate is so much cheaper.
Also, with all this contreversy over webers,  what about solex carbs?  are
they any better?  will they even fit on a bus.  I am running a progressive
right now and don't care for it to much.
Hunter
