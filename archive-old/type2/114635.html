Subject: battery maintenance

I finally cried uncle and gave into battery maintenance. It started over the weekend with my motorcycle battery. It wouldn't start after only 2 weeks sitting from a full charge and a peek inside revealed it was out of water. Well, 16 oz. of distilled water! and 4 hours in the charger brought it back to life and it starts like brand new again.

It got me wondering about my bus battery so I checked the levels (ok) put it on the charger overnight because it's a much larger battery than the m/c and put it back it. I do a lot of short trips in the bus...

The negative cable was replaced last year and the positive cable needed some care: I cut the cable to remove the corroded wire and took off the cheapo terminal and gave it a good baking soda scrub. I put it back with a light coat of vaseline and now the bus, like the bike, starts better than ever: instantly. Don't forget to clear the battery top or dust. I also cleaned the transmission ground strap.

Don't overlook the battery. You'll go crazy wondering what part of the FI isn't working 100% when all you need it more juice. The battery I have is a group 42 (small one) but it has no trouble starting a bus in this weather.
