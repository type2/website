Subject: Re: [T2] Bus woes &amp; patience rewarded!

Dan,

I had the same thing on my 78, except it had sat 8 years.

What is left of 8 year old gasoline is rock hard ugly &quot;evil&quot; stuff.

I could only get it out of the metal lines from the tank by using lacquer
thinner and pushing a piece of balling wire into it until I go it cleaned
out.  It took almost 3 hours off and on to get the outlet pipe from the
tank to the filter cleaned out.

DISCLAIMER-
THe next part is probably *very* dangerous as lacquer thinner is seriously
explosive.  I have been extremely careful with it....don't do this unless
you are wide awake and have a fire extinguisher close....preferably
outside at least 50 feet away from everything!

Needless to say, the two little pipes on the gas tank were rock solid
also.  Here is what I did.  Put 1 gallon of lacquer thinner and 1 gallon
of gas in the tank....left it for two weeks...every time I walked by, I
rocked the bus a little to slosh it around.  Finally got my reward on
Sunday.  I finally got both pipes opened up.

Went and bought 2 clear throwaway filters and the cheapest electric fuel
pump(5-9psi) I could buy at the flaps.  I hooked the gas tank pipes up to
the electric pump and just rotated the fluid inside for 15
minutes...filter looks really ugly now, but it *is* pumping well.  This
weekend I will drain what is in the tank and refill with the same combo
and run the pump again for a while....you get the idea...

I really don't expect the cheap fuel pump to last too long with the
lacquer thinner running thu it, but if it saves me from taking the tank
out, I will be thrilled.

All of this *before* I hook the tank back in to the fi system as I have 4
new injectors and wouldn't want *any* of this stuff in them.

The stuff that is in the tank is &quot;evil&quot;.  You get it on your hands and it
doesn't come off except with lacquer thinner....and it smells *really*
bad.  I'm not sure what I will do with the drained mixture of lacquer
thinner and gas as I wouldn't put it in anything and run it.  I expect to
take it to my local hazardous materials recycling center.

I know that the proper thing to do would be to take the tank out and have
it cleaned at the radiator shop....which I might do when I pull the
engine...but not before...just want to be able to drive it some soon so I
can figure out what kind of shape everything else is in, and start fixing
it.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Greetings List,
&gt; Here is the situation: Took the Bus (78) to get emissions today and the
 guy said he couldn't get it to high enough RPM's, it kept &quot;spurting&quot;. 
He says he thinks the fuel system is dirty and I should change the
filter...

&gt; Thanx in advance
