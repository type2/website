&gt;&gt; Removing Type IV engine from 78 bus for first time.  It is unclear to me if
&gt;&gt; the transmission must be supported while removing the engine.  What is the
&gt;&gt; best method of doing this while pulling the engine back from the tranny with
&gt;&gt; a floorjack?  Any suggestions on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; The tranny supports itself - no need for additional support.  Same for any
&gt; 72-79 US-spec bus with type IV engine.

Check first to make sure the two bolts that are supposed to hold the
transmission in the bus are actually there. You'll be able to feel them
right below the gas tank cover plate. The PO of my Riviera took them out,
with the result that when I removed the engine, the transmission came with
it.
