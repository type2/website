Subject: Re: [T2] Heat exchanger update, pictures

I looked at your pics......  I hate to tell you this but that is not a bus
heater box.  That is a 411/412 heater box for a 411/412 with a BA 4 heater.
They just preheat the air before it enters the BA 4 heater. As a heater box
that will be needed to heat a bus, it will not do a very good job. It is
lacking the finned heatsink to carry heat and the outer 'box' is way small.
A real full size 72-74 bus box is pictured in the 68-79 Bentley, section 5,
page 13. Or G and H here:

They are straight sided, not odd shaped like yours.


&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; I just thought I would show you what I did to the heat
&gt; exchanger today. I didn't get much done but I think I
&gt; will get faster as I go along. I have decided to not
&gt; use fiberglass wrap. Thanks for the advice. Thanks so
&gt; much, gotta run. Have a good night!
&gt;
