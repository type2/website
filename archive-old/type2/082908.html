&gt; did the coilover shocks add any ride height or extra weight gain, say for
&gt; hauling a trailer or is there a better suggestion for this.

Most folks use them for correcting torsion bar sag at the rear, as it is
easier to replace shocks than it is to reset the torsion bars.

You don't want any ride height above stock, as it will make the ride
worse, the handling spooky, and wear out tires and CV joints/boots faster.

A bus really shouldn't be subjected to more than 100 pounds of tongue
weight, so the stock suspension should do fine.
