&gt;  I put my key into the door handle, turn the key, pull the lever,

&gt;   
&gt;  apparently some internals have broken.  It looks like
&gt;  I need to take off the inside of the door to get in there.
&gt;   
&gt;  I only ask because I made the mistake of taking *way* too much
&gt;  stuff off my Vanagon when I was messing with the door locks,
&gt;  and I don't want to make nay more work for myself on the Loaf
&gt;  if I can help it...
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  anyone care to share what I can expect to find inside?

Hi Matt,

you will need to remove inside handles and the trim panel to access the lock 
mechanism.

When exactly this happened to me on my previous bus a few years back it was 
simply the screw on the inner end of the lock barrel had come loose so that 
the mechanism didn't move with the key. If you are unlucky the screw and its 
serrated washer may have fallen into the bottom of the door.

Good luck
