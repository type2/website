Subject: Re: [T2] Driving with a bad valve

The possibilities of this happening depends on how long the previous
owner/driver drove it since the loss of compression/valve seat dropping from
the head.
 I guess if you have the option of towing or driving, i would personally
spend the extra $ and tow. If i was stuck in the middle of nowhere, only 40
miles from home (totally possible for me) I would remove the push rods and
drive home.
 Type 4 engines are also more spendy to replace parts, used or new. I guess
i am always looking at the money/time constraints when it comes to repairs,
you don't want to make more work for yourself, or for some people have to
write a bigger check to get it fixed.
 BTW about the spark plug hole, you could actually leave the spark plug
loose in the threads, (just in case it needed to release some pressure)
because if the valves aren't moving, and the spark plug wire is not
attached, the spark plug has no functionality....but that is just my .2
cents.

&gt; I wouldn't put the rag in the plug hole however. What if it got sucked

&gt;
&gt; Hey Guys What are the chances of that happening and the head has to come
&gt; off anyway . I said to put the rag in the tin hole to keep any oil from
&gt; splashing all over. or just duct tape the hole . I drove my 59 panel back
&gt; from Circle yar wagens on 3 clylinders when a Junk Mofoco head gave up
&gt; getting me there 250 miles little slow going up hill but I made it. $0 miles
&gt; shouldnt be any problem. later and have fun Mark Dearing
