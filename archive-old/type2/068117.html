&gt; The mechanic  has now removed the left-side cylinder head on our 2 litre

&gt; repaired. The bottom end is in good shape as many  on the list predicted. 
&gt; I have spoken to both the Mark Stephens people and GEX. Here are my options.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. A fellow at GEX (named Mick) when pressed, offered to repair the cylinder
&gt; head at their cost, if it could be demonstrated that the engine had not been
&gt; overheated. Initially he insisted that I return the head to them for
&gt; inspection before a decision could be made. I made it clear that I did not
&gt; want to go through the same hassles as many others have in negotiating a
&gt; deal with GEX. The mechanic here has  since determined that the engine has
&gt; not overheated. If that is indeed true then GEX will replace the head (or
&gt; rebuild it) at their cost plus pay the shipping, or so says Mick.
&gt; 
&gt; My main concern here is ensuring: a) that the head that  comes back is
&gt; improved over the version that failed and b) that I will actually get the
&gt; head back at no cost. Given the current situation (failure at 20,000 miles,
&gt; change in ownership at GEX and their reputation problems), I am reluctant to
&gt; take up GEX's offer. GEX claims to now follow a procedure similar to MS in
&gt; rebuilding heads. GEX also failed to respond to any of the three e-mail
&gt; messages that I sent out three days ago.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. MS will rebuild both heads (or just the one) for 180.00 not including
&gt; shipping with a turn around time of 3-5 days. Initially when I balked at
&gt; naming the company who sold the engine, the MS guy said &quot; was it G-E-X?&quot; so
&gt; he seems familiar with their reputation. They also rebuld heads for VW of
&gt; Canada.
&gt; 
&gt; Which path would you take?

You really need to give GEX a chance to make it good. I think you will
find that most suppliers will want to look at the part in question;
wouldn't you in their spot?

Dropped seats are just part of the beast! Not plesant, but it sometimes
happens.

I doubt MS replaces the seats on a rebuild. Most only do a reface job.
The fault with the seat goes to the factory. GEX just happens to have to
eat it because they reworked the heads ( assuming the heads were rebuilt
and not new ).
