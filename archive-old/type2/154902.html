From the Ratwell link &quot;2. If you drill into the inspection plate then the sender will be in the airflow below the engine. Some folks who've found the 914 plate often lack the accompanying cover plate that keeps the airflow from reaching the sender. The result is the same either way: the sender is overcooled and this throws off the reading so you must have a deflection cover in place.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Porsche still sell the 914 plate but they are not cheap. Try Pelican Parts 
&gt; (get the part numbers from my article):

&gt; Richard, 
&gt; 
&gt; How important is the wind deflector (039-101-267) in your URL listed 
&gt; above? Porsche wants more for that than they do for the inspection plate.
