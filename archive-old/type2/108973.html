Subject: Re: [VB] GL4

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I will say, though, that others on the list whose legends approach &quot;Guru&quot;
status have said to me on-list and in person that this is just not true, and
that the MT-5 is no bueno.
&gt;

I've run it for years, no problem. In cooler weather, the GL-4 will shift
smoother, but as far as wear and corrosion, there should be no concern using
the MT gl-5. I do prefer gl-4 though, and synthetic being my top pick.
