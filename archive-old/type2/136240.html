Subject: RE: [T2] Hard Starting - Update 5

Wow.  
   
Measuring 12 volts on the battery outside the vehicle
is well-and-good, but it is not a measure of how much
CURRENT / AMPHERAGE the battery can deliver.  A
Battery Stress test determines that.  But the new
battery should be full of vim and vigor.  But a bad
battery possibility nonetheless.
    
&quot;11 to zero in 2 seconds?&quot;  With Ignition switch to
&quot;ON&quot; (versus &quot;off&quot; or &quot;start&quot;) I would assume
something is consuming the current.  As a quick and
simple diagnostic, you should pull-out each and every
fuse, then switch the ignition on.  When your gauge
ceases to drop from 11 to zero in 2 seconds, you will
have found the &quot;current sucking circuit.&quot; 
   
&quot;11 to zero in 2 seconds?&quot;  With Ignition switch to
&quot;Start?&quot;  Starter and/or solinoid.
    
Another thought.  What is the possibility you
installed the WR1 (Hot Start relay) wrong?  Since that
was a change, undo the WR1 installation and try to
start the vehicle with the new battery.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got a new battery and a new hot-start relay,
&gt; hooked them up, and got 11
&gt; &gt; volts at the gauge.  However, the battery tests at
&gt; 12 volts when
&gt; &gt; out of the
&gt; &gt; car.  Switch on the ignition, and voltage drops to
&gt; zero in about
&gt; &gt; 2 seconds.
