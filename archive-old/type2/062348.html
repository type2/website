&gt; Subject: VIN question..

&gt; Could someone please tell me what year this VIN number is from on
&gt; this Kombi??

&gt; The VIN is 2212224378.

&gt; When did they switch from the 6 digit style VIN to the longer one?

Michael,

It's (kinda) mmysssssss, where mm is the model (22) and y is the
year (1971) and sssssss is the sequential serial number.  This
system started in 1965.  Not sure when it ended.  So, my '67
Deluxe is 247142402, as in model 24, year 1967, and the 142,402nd
made that model year.
