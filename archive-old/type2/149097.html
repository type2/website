Subject: VW Bus Stuff for Sale

Hi,

I've been doing some cleaning and straightening and have come up with a 
few things that need to go.

VW Camper propane tank. It is currently in working order with a new 
valve and regulator. It does have surface rust.

A 1968-69 model year turn signal arm in working order.

The VW Bus library - a collection of 10 VW bus and bus related books - 
some of which are a bit hard to come buy even on Amazon - especially at 
a good price. I am offering them up as a complete set first and if no 
one wants to go that route the individual prices are listed for later 
reference.  The books are generally in very good shape.

To simplify all of this I have put together a web page with pics, 
details, and prices. Please visit is at
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~vwmail/index.html

Thanks
Chris
