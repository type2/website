Subject: Re: [T2] Can anyone ID this spice rack??

Hi John,

That looks like a metal rendition of the side-table attached to the 
6x-73 westfalia sink/ice-box unit. I have found that side table/rack to 
be near invaluable when installed on the back of the seat pedestal 
where the icebox/sink used to be. It's convenient when you need 
something small (matches, BBQ starter, first aid for burns...) and it 
folds up out of the way when not in use.

Not having one in my swivel-seated westy *almost* makes me wish I had 
bulkheads behind the seats. At least until I swivel the seat and put my 
feet up on the camp stool.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; There was an interesting spice rack attached to the
&gt; cargo door of a 67 parts bus I recently obtained. It
&gt; is a combination spice rack\table. The shelves and
&gt; frame of the spice rack are made of metal, then there
&gt; is a hinged table top attached. When the table top is
&gt; folded down, it closes the spice rack. Attached is a
&gt; link to the picture, I'd love it if someone could give
&gt; me any info on this. either it is from a strange
&gt; camper coach builder or maybe it is hame-made kinda
&gt; thing. Any info is appreciated! Heres the pic:
