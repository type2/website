George and the List,

Sorry George, but I gotta take issue with your comments about the flammability
issue.  If the painted part is dry enough to handle in order to put it into
the oven, there will not be enough volatile solvents left to make a flammable
mixture.   The nose is very sensitive, but it takes several percent of the
solvent (depending on exactly what it is) to reach a flammable or LEL (lower
explosive limit).  I do agree with the smell issue, which may also be
hazardous.

&lt;I've done the same, but I've been lately pondering the safety of this
practice.  The paint is liberating a lot of very flammable gases and
the combination of these gases and the flames or red-hot heating
elements in a closed oven could lead to disaster. &gt;
