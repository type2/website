Subject: Re: [T2] Engine install update

If available, you could have used an earlier bell housing/starter with 
the shorter studs.
In my daughter's 75 bus was placed a late trans (77) which the rebuilder 
had switched to the earlier bell housing to use the working earlier 
starter. That trans failed-
so when we put in a replacement later trans,  (luckily we dropped 
engine/trans together- made it easy)  I also noticed this problem, and 
got the studs off a parter late engine-as I had a late starter also.
Simpler than removing the bell housing. What was not mentioned; you also 
need longer upper bolts - we had to hustle to find those..

&gt;I finaly got the engine mated to the transmition today! Put the nuts on the
&gt;two top bolts and snugged them up.
&gt;crawled underneath the passenger side and put the nut on that stud, HMMM the
&gt;stud is a little short.
