Hello everyone I'm a new guy here. I have a '63 Sundial that I'm finally
finishing the body work. There is now much more bondo on the garage floor
than on the bus.
Question: my wife and I have hotel reservations for the Eureka Spring, Ark.
VW event, Aug24th. Are any of you going or do you know anything about it?
The financial timing is a little off. If there is alot for me to learn I'll
still go, but if it's not a really big deal I'll put the bucks into the Bus.
Anyone?
