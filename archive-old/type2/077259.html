Tim:
Jeez! I think you're selling it too cheap! $400 seems about right to me.
Considering that progressive carbs have no plenum heating and no air
pre-heating, that number make the real cost of fixing stock carbs or FI a much
more attractive alternative.
I'm sure that someone with less skill than you might take many times 4 hours to
rejet them and get them set up correctly. I know I've sunk many hours into such
projects and made it better, but still felt I wasn't quite there.

So, I paid $289 for the kit plus shipping, put an extra 4 highly skilled

&gt; hours and $10 parts into t-cable interface functional design, then $70 for
&gt; jets and emulsion tubes custom calculated for stock 72 1700cc, then more
&gt; time to install them. At my current rate, the kit, the improvement of the
&gt; throttle hookup to make it work properly, the jets and their installation
&gt; is a retail value of $629 time/money out of pocket. But for the washer
&gt; marks from mounting, the carb kit appears as new, and was fully cleaned and
&gt; base adjustments verified when making the jet swaps. It is ready to install
&gt; and make final running adjustments. You should plan on using new gaskets
&gt; and seals which are not provided with my kit.
