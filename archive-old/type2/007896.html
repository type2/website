Subject: Barney's heater assist
Date: Sat, 28 Nov 1998 17:55:23 -0800

Hi all,

After many P-mails, about where to find Barney's, I decided to post this
for everyone.

The kit is called &quot;Volkswagen Bus Heater/Defroster Assist Kit&quot;  It is from
&quot;Barney's Import Parts.&quot;  You can see their ad in any &quot;Bikini's and Hot
VW's&quot; magazine.  (Pg. 16 in the Dec. issue.)  Their address is:

Barney's Import Parts
1625 West Prince Rd
Tucson, AZ 85705
Tel:  1-800-VEE-DUBS    (1-800-833-3827)

I bought my kit from a former busser who had never installed it.  The parts
included were:  fan (metal body, Bakelite fan blades), wiring, 3 speed
switch, mounting hardware, metal tape for sealing up the fan install, and
illustrated instructions.  I just read through their ad again and it didn't
mention the three speed
fan in the bus kit but it did mention it in their bug kit.  So I think it
is
still included.  So be sure to ask them about that.  I bought mine almost 4
years ago so things change.    ;-)

Your mileage may vary,
Clark
