Subject: Re: [T2] intermittent loss of power

 FWIW Bob I had a similar problem in my 78 manual a few months ago. My
buddy
&gt; and I drove to Rhode Island from DC and was getting this weird
occasionally
&gt; hesitation like water in gas or an occasional misfiring injector. On the
&gt; trip home it became a little more persistent but not enough to really
&gt; inconvenience us just annoying b/c we could not figure it out. When I got

&gt;right, no misfiring or sound even,

Could it be bad fuel? Water in the gas? Rare but not impossible? Probably
would not be so intermittent though.

&gt;I have Pertronix points replacer, my understanding is they are all or
nothing when they fail they totally fail, I may be wrong but I will check

That is what I have heard as well. Other than electrical connections the
only other thing I can think of is well you know... what we always tell
folks with FI Bays.. vacuum leaks... Perhaps a soft motor/tranny causing a
vacuum line to open up?
