greetings all,
man it has been awhile since i wrote a message to the list.  i see there are
quite a number of new folks i dont know on here.  

anywas the sale of my 73 is the purpose of this post.  i will list describe
and tell the background of the bus, the facts will be listed in no
particular order.

73 van 
i bought the van from a farmer in western nebraska.  he was the original
owner, bought it new from vern hagestaed vw in denver.  he used it on the
farm to transport workers and run errands.  rarely driven in winter (not
much farming going on when it snows), this is great because there is
absolutely NO rot at all.  ONLY surface pitting on the nose.  there is NO
rust under the wheel wells, bottoms of doors, or under the rubber mats.  The
ONLY place is under the battery, about a fist size hole.  i put a plastic
tray to set the battery in when i got the bus.

after giving it a tune up, i drove it home 5-6 hours one way, no trouble.  i
pulled the engine to give it a once over.  everything was in spec, minus
rings and heads.  i did rings, heads and clutch and all new seals.  that was
four years ago.  in my opinion the bus needs new heads again.  the valve
guides are getting loose causing a bit of blowby out the valve cover
gaskets.  the van is a daily driver, and holds 65-70 as long as you need.

the front seats re-done in original vw material.  complete brake job from
front to back.  i have a DETAILED maintenance log and every reciept.

it needs:
-tires are fair
-one c.v. boot on passenger side
-emergency brake does not work (never has since i have owned it)
-window rubber is getting dry

good things it has:
-exceptional maintenance
-original stock solex dual carbs (working fabulous)
-not a spot of body rot, anywhere
-has middle seat
-excellent headliner, upholstery (front seats brand new, cost $250 to have
done)
-heater tubes and ducts not rusted out, blower assist fan works.
-still has ONE original key to operate all doors!!!
-new clutch
-crane xr700 electronic ignition (no points adjust)
-have a bunch of odds and ends parts to include
-never wrecked or even bent bumpers
-all lights/blinkers/horn/washer bottle.. everything works
-no wacky reapir jobs.  the correct part replaced the broken part. no
bailing wire and duct tape repairs on this bus at all.
-will possibly deliver (drive it you/or half-way) if schedule permits (about
4-8 hours from omaha, ne)

reasons not to buy it:
-dual carbs need even more attention than the normal high maintenance bus
-engine needs heads possibly more..._dot_compression has dropped a few pounds
each time i check.  still holds highway speeds when i take it on trips.  
-needs alignment
-needs emergency brake fixed

am asking $1700/or reasonable offer.  

i will not be able to answer emails until the weekend so be patient.  i have
a digital camera but have not figured it out correctly.  the pictures i have
taken pretty much suck.  i will try again though, so those who are
interested can see it.  

thanks for reading folks.
