Subject: the 034 distributor

i have two 034's - single vac advance. one i have run in my 68 for three
years, the other on the workbench alongside an engine being built up. in
the 68, the rotor and timing mark sit at 1 o'clock. i had considered
changing out the drive gear, but never got around to it for fear of
dropping a shim, plus it stays in tune well and gets exceptional gas
mileage. while building up the new engine this week, i set the drive gear
and found the rotor wanting to be at the 1 o'clock position again. hmmm. i
swapped in 009 and found the rotor and mark at the commonly found 4 o'clock
position.  list, what gives?  - steve
