&gt; That's right- I let mom use my bus for a week.  I should have known 
&gt; better-
&gt; especially since she hasn't driven a VW in 30 years.


Whoa! Slow down there.  Let's make that:

&quot;Don't let people who don't know how to drive an aging VW drive your bus&quot;

Otherwise, next thing you know we're gonna have people saying &quot;Don't
let your girlfriend/sister/grandma/etc drive your bus when really it's 
just a function
of knowledge&quot;
