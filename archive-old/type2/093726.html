Subject: re: [T2] timing question

[...]
    later halls sender dizzy were used to replace earlier ones.  a digi
1 halls sender operated independantly from the computer so would
probably be a plug in replacement with only a slightly different
curve.  (just looked it up  and the only difference is the curve and it
is slight.)  both time at 5ATDC  and use the same internal and external
parts with the exception of the vacuum pot. This would provide that
slight difference in the curve.  Always follow your hood stamps.   they
may reflect a change that is not in a general purpose manual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The distributor reference page is great!  This morning I pulled out my
&gt;&gt;&gt; flashlight and dentist mirror and got my dizzy model #: 0237 022 025.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; According to the chart, this is a distributor for a &quot;Vanagon
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1983-1984 *
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1900 Digijet&quot;.  It is supposed to be timed at 5ATDC.  Is this the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt; part for my '79 CA bus?  Is that why I had to monkey with the timing 
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; get it to run decently at all?
