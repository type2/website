Subject: RE: [T2] CV joint resiliance. Question about maintance before a
  long  trip

Hmmm.... I know I'm gonna get it, but here goes...

I stopped using clamps on the axle end of my CV boots many years ago. I
found that the boots lasted much longer, and I haven't had noticeable wear
on the joints. Driving through deep water warrants an inspection, though. Go
ahead and clean them out as you described, and let us know what you find.

&gt; Hello List.
&gt; resilience
&gt; I have a question regarding the cv joints on my 68
&gt; bus. I have no problem with the joints them selves as
&gt; they do not clunk. They do not have any noticable play
&gt; in them. The only thing is that one of the clamps came
&gt; undone for an unknown length of time and I am afraid
&gt; that dirt has collected inside the boots.
