Cesar,

I am forwarding your problem to the list for others to see and respond to
it. Below are my thoughts on it.

Your problem sounds very electrical to me.  A loose connection, on the
coil, on the fuel pump, on the grounds under the air distribution box, or
on any of the FI plugs could be the cause.  Intermittent electrical
problems are by far the *worst* kind, and it sounds like you have one :-(
I would (a) remove, replace and wiggle all the electrical connectors on
the ignition and FI wiring harnesses.  If any look like they have any
significant corrosion, I would brighten them with some 600 or 800 grit
wet/dry sandpaper.  (b) check the dwell at 800-2500 RPM.  If it is
&quot;bouncy&quot; the spring on your points may be going.  I will bet all your
components are fine, but that they may not be connected correctly all the
time.

If nothing seems to be making a difference, then you will need to rig a   
set of test leads that go from the engine compartment to a VOM semi-
permanently mounted on your dash.  Take the bus out for a drive and hope
for the symptoms to recurr.  Move the leads until you isolate the problem.
The order in which I would attach the test leads is:

(1) check primary voltage at the coil (+ to black wire on coil, - to
ground). Should be 12V all the time. If it ain't, somethign is wrong in
your charging system or ignition switch.

(2) check secondary voltage at the coil (+ to green wire (to condensor) on
coil, - to ground). Should be ~7V If it begins to vary, then your
ignitioon system is screwy, check and change points, plugs, wires,
condensor.

(3) check voltage to the fuel pump (+ &amp; - to appropriate leads on fuel
pump). If the voltage starts to vary when the van is acting up, then it's
double relay, switch in the AFM, or fuel pump.

(4) check injector voltages (between one injector lead and injector). If
they start to vary, then it is something in the FI system.  I would check
this last, since in my experience, the FI is rarely the real problem.

&gt; jumping I let go of the gas and it stops and the car is OK
&gt; them it starts up again.
&gt;  
&gt; 1. I changed the fuel pump
&gt; It was not that .
&gt; 
&gt; 2. I changed the E.C.U
&gt; It was not that.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.I checked the wire harness for any bad connections
&gt; It was not that.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. I changed the Injectors
&gt; It was not that.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. I changed the roter and 
&gt; cole.
&gt; It was not that
