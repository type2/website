Subject: Heater controls

I just realized that since I just recently bought my 4th bus that it's 
about time I came to grips with the heater controls. Am I alone? I have 
never felt competent at adjusting them. 
What I know..

                        All to the right = defrost
                        Heat to the left=       cool
                        Heat to the right=      Hot

                I'm not sure about the rest (Don't make fun of me now...I've only been 
driving these babys for about 15 years)

I have the manual.. It doesn't make it clear to me. Is there a good description
of what these controls actually do and how they work in some other book or publication?
