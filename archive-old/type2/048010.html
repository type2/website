Meredith, I live in the terrarium called Seattle.  I use Fog-ex on the
inside and Rain-ex on the outside and both work as advertized.  Also, I
carry a small squeegee on my dash, between the defrost vents to swipe away
with when it gets especially dense.  A friend uses a clean, old-fashioned
chalkboard eraser.

foggily yours,
Jody
