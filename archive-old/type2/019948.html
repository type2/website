&gt; My question is, does the new Bowden tube come with the sheath?  The sheath
&gt; did not come with the clutch cable.

The bowden tubes I have include the sheath.  Be careful and take in or measure
your correct tube for length as I have at least 3 different lengths with my VW
stuff.  Different applications.
