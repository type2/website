&lt;&lt; A good way to trace an obscure oil leak is with dye. There are oil 
additives available that make the oil glow under a black (UV) light 
source. Simply add the magic ingredient and start the engine, then 
watch for leaks using a UV bulb in your trouble-light. I haven't tried 
this myself, but I'm told it is popular with racing mechanics.

Happy trails,

My bottle is from Wurth, but NAPA has a similar product...Any party
supplies shop will have a black lite bulb for a few bucks... ;-)
