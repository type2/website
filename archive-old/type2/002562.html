Subject: Replacing master cylinder

Listees,

I plan on replacing the master cylinder this weekend on my 74 Westy.  The reason I am replacing it is that recently I discovered that it was leaking where the master is mated to the servo.  I am wondering what the possibility is that brake fluid leaked into the servo?  Is there something additional that I need to do (such as removing the servo to get fluid out)?

Also, is there other items that I should replace while replacing the master cylinder (such as seals)?

TIA
