&gt; Tried to pick up a set of the w8cc's from autozone and had no luck.  
&gt; They told me
&gt;   that the bosch w8cc's were discontinued. Is this true?

According to the master parts catalog W8CC (#7504) has fair sales  
popularity index. W7CC (#7498) is also fair.

(Very fast &gt; good &gt; fair &gt; slow &gt; obsolete)

&gt; Also, would anyone know
&gt;   which NGK plug would be best for a 2.0 FI for hot weather use?  
&gt; Thanks.

B6ES = W7CC (I prefer this one for fuel injection)
B5ES = W8CC

BP6ES = W7DC
BP5ES = W8DC

The latter two plugs are projected nose plugs. Here's a photo of the  
difference:

&gt; Hello Wes   NGK  bpr5es     or  bpr6es   will work just fine   
&gt; later  mark

These are resistor plugs...I've never used them but I know Karl  
recommends against using them.
