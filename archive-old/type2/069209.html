&gt; Could you post their number or address? I would really like to check into

The flux cored wire welders do not work nearly as well as MIG, only
to be used outside really where your gas gets blown away.  Strong
supporter of harbor freight I am I caution against their MIGs, I
strongly considered it but called and found that the stock warranty is
like 30 DAYS or so and a 2-3 year one is like an extra 75% of price.  I
was not impressed.  After looking locally at the cheaper under $600
Lincolns and the Century stuff available from Sams Club, I went with
Sams larger Century, warranty was right, price right for a 220V unit
with its output, and quality looked much BETTER to me than the Lincoln
units.  YMMV.
