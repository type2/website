&gt;There is a distinct VW aircooled interior smell and I've rationalized it as
&gt;the horsehair seat stuffing combined with years of trace exhaust and
&gt;gasoline fumes.   I've noticed a distinct smell common to '65-'68 Mustangs
&gt;also.  I've convinced myself it is the emissions from the vinyl upholstery
&gt;and the fabric carpeting.

&gt;Whatever it is and whatever its level of toxicity, it does give you that
&gt;&quot;warm, homey&quot; feeling, don't it?!

After I bought my bus and drove it awhile... and emailed the satisfaction to
my dad... He replied &quot;I don't think you've ever had as much fun with a car
since your '66 Mustang&quot;

The 'Stang I got back in '86 just as I went into highschool and it was
totalled in car accident in 1988...

I have had a 1967 Chevy Cherry red pickup, a 1974 GMC Jimmy 4x4 and a 1986
Honda Accord since then... But nothing gives me satisfaction like the VW....

Be it smell? Gas fumes? I don't know.... I don't know if there is some kind
of correlation between old 'stangs and VW's... I love em both..

The '66 Stang be my Ex... My new babe... is hot... maybe just the
contours... that smooth rounded classic design, a one of type kind of car
that will never be new again.. .. a piece of classic history...
knowing...that each year it is more precious like a family heirloom...
almost priceless (as you can see by the posts of upkeep... you never get out
of it what you put in... unless you take into consideration... SATISFACTION
or in VW terms FAHRFUGNUGEN)

Just my Canadian penny,

Brian.
