Subject: S. Jersey, Philly area VW Parts Shop? 

Volks,
	I've been in the South Jersey/ Philadelphia area for about a year now and 
have done all of my purchaces through mail order and I'm getting kind of 
tired of all the hassles that go with it (wrong parts, poor customer 
service, not being home when the mail comes, etc...). Unfortunately, I 
can't seem to find a VW specific parts shop anywhere in the area. Can 
anyone give me some leads here?
Thanks,
Joel
