Subject: Re: [T2] oil relief plug removal help

Don, they can be evil as hell. Here are some suggestions. 

1) Take a sharp chisel, put it in the slot, angle the chisel over at about60
degrees and hit the plug in the direction to unscrew it. Make sure you hit
it towards one edge of the plug though so the force will cause it to twist
or turn. This will usually do it, but if not - - - 

2) My favorite cause I have a welder. :-)  Tack a nut on the bottom of the 
plug (it's steel) and use a socket and ratchet to get it off. I wait till it
s cooled right down to allow it to shrink back to room temp first. Just a
quick tack inside the threaded part of the nut does it, use a 15 or 17mm nut
 You don't want lots of heat, just a fast zap. I learned this from owning a
motorcycle with a very stuck oil filter bolt that was rounded off by the
previous owner.

HTH,
Courtney

Hi all - So far I've broken my regular big screwdriver, and my largest
impact spade bit trying to get this plug loose.  The plug has suffered
some damage as well.  The thing will not move! (even though it is
covered in oil :)  It's on a 1500 sp.
 
Thanks
 
Don J
