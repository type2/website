Subject: Re: [T2] Heating with water - seeking what-if-ideas

You need to worry about where the heat is going when the heater isn't on!
Otherwise, the coolent will boil away!

A better way to go might be a oil-water heat exchanger.  The oil doesn't
get as hot, so it would be easier to get the heat under control.

&gt; Just wondering - thinking too much actually...
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone created sealed heater boxes and circulated antifreeze through
&gt; them to capture the heat and then circulate it through a heater core inside
&gt; the bus and heated the interior like a normal, boring watercooled car?
&gt;
&gt; Any such thing as an electric pump that would deal with the recirculation
&gt; duties?
&gt;
&gt; Just wondering...
