Subject: '66 progress, windshields, link-pins, axle-boots

Hi all,

Just a report on some progress over the weekend working on the '66 microbus.

I have had a small leak from the transmission swing-axle boots since I got
this thing on the road.  When I had the front end (drag link, tie rod ends)
done at a local mechanic a couple months ago I asked him to look at this.
They said they had tightened up the boots and the leak went away.  Indeed it
did, for a while, then it started leaking again.  Just a little, mebbe two
pumps worth of hypoid gear oil every 1000 miles or so, little marks on the
driveway on either side of the transmission, I could live with it.  Saturday
I replaced both boots to see if I could eliminate the leak.  The old boots
seemed to be in good shape generally, one more flexible than the other but
no holes.  The Bentley manual suggests sealing along the split in the
split boot with sealant.  The old boots had no such sealant but I put in
a little high-temp silicone sealant anyway.  This is an easy job in general,
just a little greasy-oily-dirty.  Each boot has 6 little bolts that hold the
split boot together and two hose clamps, one on each end.  It seems to be
fixed but time will tell.

On Sunday, I adjusted my link-pins.  There is/was some side-to-side play
in the front wheels so I figured, before I replace the king-pin assemblies,
I'd better try adjusting the link-pins.  This is another easy job the only hard
part of which, as John Muir says, is cleaning all the crud off the pinch-bolts,
link-pins, and grease-fittings prior to actually adjusting the pins.  I went
at it with screwdriver, rags, WD-40, and a brush and eventually got the whole
area reasonably clean (there was a pile of dirt under each side of the front
end by the time I was done.)  On one side, the link pins needed quite a bit
of adjustment, on the other, nearly none.  Everything is now greased up,
clean, and adjusted but there is still a very small amount of play on both
sides.  Well, the tires seem to be wearing normally so I'm not in a big
hurry to replace the king-pin assemblies (but I will eventually).

Yesterday, I also replaced the rubber seals around the two front windshields.
The seals were so dried out and cracked that it was like Niagra falls when
it rained and much of the water ended up on my feet or in the parcel tray or
on my CB radio, etc.  (not a good thing)  So I bought seals from the West
Coast Metric dealer here in town and went at it.  The windshield panes were
easily removed by cutting off the lip of rubber on the inside of the vehicle
and pushing the windows out (my helper caught them!).  Fortunately, there was
almost no rust under the seals and I cleaned out what little I found.
I cleaned the window frames up good, used polishing compound on both sides
of the windshields to clean them up good (original windshields with a few
chips but still serviceable), put on the new seals, and installed them.
I have read about using a wire or cord placed in the groove in the window
seal to pull the rubber lip over the metal lip from the inside while a
helper pushes from the outside and I tried this with the first windshield.
That worked fairly well but I found the little window seal tool I purchased
on Saturday invaluable.  This tool has a plastic handle like a screwdriver,
and a tapered cylindrical curved steel hooked &quot;blade&quot; with a little sphere
of steel on the end.  Given that I had sprayed the window seals with copious
amounts of WD-40 to make them slick, this tool was just the thing to hook
under the rubber lip and pop it over the frame.  I used this tool exclusively
on the second windshield as I found it much easier to use than the wire/cord.
This whole procedure was easier than I had expected and the results look
great, I look forward to replacing all the other window rubber (although I
don't look forward to *buying* it  :-).

Well, hmmmm, too much rambling already, sorry, too much coffee!

Cheers,

 -Dyer
