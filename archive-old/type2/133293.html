Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

I've had enough problems over the years with solids.

&gt; Those lifters are the worst thing that VW did to these engines. It was done
&gt; for ONE reason, and that was lack of sales because people were too lazy to
&gt; adjust their valves.

count me in, I got rid of my last (first part of my life) VW in 1978 and
adjusting lifters was among the reasons, got the late model bus in 1992
and one reason I chose this bus was hyd lifters.

&gt; The lifters don't just cause lifter issues, they promote head issues and are
&gt; the root of all evil.

one persons opinion and I am sure you have seen far more engines than I,
but if I can't keep my hdy lifters I won't keep my VW...same with the auto
tranny and Pertronix.,   this is my daily driver not my daily work on it.

and while I am sure you build a fine engine, if I ever need to buy an
engine from someone it will have hyd lifters or I will get it elsewhere..
  not a big deal but it is my $$ and I long ago learned if I'm spending it
I'm getting what I want..

guess we have to agree to disagree on this one
