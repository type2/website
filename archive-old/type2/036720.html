Subject: Re: [Re: Gauge placement questions]

In some 83-8X Toyotas, namely 4-runners and the 4wd tercel wagon, there is a
'clinometer' mounted on the top of the dash just to the right of the
instrument cluster. It is a device the indicates on two planes (though
roughly) the current angle at which the vehicle sits with repect to 'level'.

The housing of this device, i think would make a perfect housing for 2-3 small
gauges - either on top of the dash (my choice) or under.  

If you ever get chance, check one out in a junkyard - the 4wd tercel is the
funky, high-top looking little car.

&gt; &gt;Hi list. I have a question about mounting gauges in my  ' 79 westy. I

&gt; &gt;thinking about putting them in the dash, under the radio, and using

&gt; &gt;gauge mounting fixture that I bought from Bus Boys.
