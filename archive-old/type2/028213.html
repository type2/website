hello list!!

i have torn boots on the rear and also a &quot;good&quot; knocking sound. I also feel 
my brakes can use some work.  I don't have the bread to feed the bus' 
appetite so I have to decide what to fix 1st.

what do ya'll think,  brakes or cv's ?

and

does anyone knows of a good mechanic in gainesville FL.? or near by?


ps: i dont know anything about the po and dont know what have been done to 
the bus. the knocking sound worries me, i hope is not the engine.
