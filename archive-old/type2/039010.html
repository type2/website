Gentleperson-
                     Open thanks to the list member who wrote about the M-B 
alloys interchange. A local junk (oops, recycler), yard was being EPA'd out 
and everything was
on sale. I saw an M-B there and the owner sold the set (5) to me for 50 
bucks. I had to
drill out the steel inserts by a hair to fit the VW studs, but they bolted 
on. Just a note-
round VW hood emblem from a Beetle fits the center hole in the alloys.
Thanks for the tip.
