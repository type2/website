Michael asks:

&gt;Also has anyone had any luck painting a muffler w/ grey paint that actually
&gt;stays on for any length of time.

I can tell you what won't work. Don't use hi-temp engine paint on the
muffler. Burns right off. Works great on the heat exchangers though.
Next time I'm going to try hi-temp stove paint. We have accidentally
gotten the wood stove REALLY hot, and the paint didn't suffer for it.
It's also rated for temps up to 1,500 F, so it should work.
