brake fluid is POISON. far better to spend a buck
on a can of aerosol brake cleaner...

&gt;
&gt;Some purists on brake fluid will argue against this, especially if
&gt;there is some kind of contamination on the outer surfaces of cylinder
&gt;and/or reservoir..... but I have done the same thing when I couldn't
&gt;find my bench bleeder tubes.  I did, however, scrounge a couple of
&gt;coffee filters from the kitchen, put the filters in a funnel, and then
&gt;filtered the fluid before putting it into the system.  Also I like to
&gt;run the cylinder casting and the reservoir [previously cleaned
&gt;internally with BBs and detergent] through the dishwasher before
&gt;reassembly......  when the Frau is not around, of course.
