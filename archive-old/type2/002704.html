I just put my new first paint on after 6 months of body work.  My auto paint
dealer sold me a paint called Omni that is cheap and covers very well and
can come in gloss or matte. It is a verathane that looks pretty damn good
and can be sanded and worked as a prep for the real big bucks paint job
that, for me , is probably a year away.

&gt; Hey volks.  My 71 bus was born all white, but from weather conditions in
the
&gt; northeast it slowly became a spot and primered rough surfaced vehicle.  I
&gt; want too get the finish paint on by next fall, but for now i was thinking
of
&gt; putting a household paint job of forest green on it.  My question to the
list
&gt; is when the resto comes will it be harder and more labor intensive to get
the
&gt; new paint off?
&gt;
&gt; later,
&gt; -Brian and and a 71 westy
&gt;
