Subject: Re: AC in Southern Buses (Long, sorry, I'll shut up now)

Well, you know they say that taste is what marries off ugly folks and  
sells lame horses, but I wanted to respond to some of the points vwwesty  
made.  I think this is list-relevant not just regarding some points he  
makes about buses, but as regards the wider attitudes toward &quot;old tech&quot;  
and lifestyle that go into our love of Type 2s.  BUT I think followups  
need to go off-list before much longer (maybe to a samba forum?) and I'm  
grateful to the list gods for letting it drag on so long. -joe

&gt; From: &quot;vwwesty&quot; &lt;vwwesty_at_indybudd_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Personally I think it's asinine to argue that going without A/C in a  
&gt; brutal
&gt; southern climate is being spoiled! Have you ever lived here in the  
&gt; summer,
&gt; daily driven a bus and worked at a job that requires you to not look and
&gt; smell like a pig when you arrive? VW offered AC as an option for good  
&gt; reason
&gt; back in the 70's.

Well, as I mentioned in an earlier post in this thread -
- yeah, I was born in FL (4th gen) and have lived here almost all my  
life.  Tallahassee, Gainesville, Tampa, Lakeland, and West Palm Beach.  I  
know what I'm talking about regarding FL summer heat.
- part of my job description has *always* been &quot;does not look/smell like  
pig at work&quot;.  It can be done.

Further, VW *never* offered factory air.  It was a dealer option, and I'd  
be willing to bet it sold most prominently in the States.  Given that we  
don't corner the market on heat nor money, I have to look for another  
reason that it was popular here.

However, asinine is something I have been and continue to be on regular  
occasion.

&gt; As for history, go back 100~1000 years in time and demonstrate an air
&gt; conditioning system and then ask &quot;OK who wants the first one?&quot; Just  
&gt; because
&gt; people survived for thousands of years without AC doesn't mean I, or  
&gt; anyone
&gt; else, wants to devolve back into a sweaty ape from the past! Apes don't  
&gt; need
&gt; houses either, they live amongst nature, are you spoiled for living in a
&gt; house?

A very good point - yes, people do tend to want conveniences.  Conversely,  
are you suggesting that simply because people want something, it's good?   
Some Inuit LOVE snowmobiles - God, what a huge improvement over dogsleds!  
- then they realize they're now dependent on oil and spare parts, and are  
losing important aspects of their culture.  Humanity has a looooong  
history of jumping on new gizmos without giving thought to the wider  
ramifications.  Automobiles, firearms, television - AC is in splendid  
company.

Technology is value-neutral.  It's what we do with it that counts.  Not  
every call to be more conservative with our adoption or employment of  
technology is equivalent to saying we should live in caves again.  I'm  
very happy to have modern medicine, but that doesn't mean I'm popping  
Xanax constantly.  Don't just think in 1's and 0's.

&gt; In SWFL summer the time between when you hop in the vehicle, and when you
&gt; start profusely sweating is about 30-45 seconds, opening the windows
&gt; increases that to about 60-90 seconds. Every single traffic light you  
&gt; stop
&gt; at is a new sweat bath, and the hot humid breezes in between red lights  
&gt; does
&gt; next to nothing to cool you off. The whole back of your shirt, the seat  
&gt; back
&gt; and many other of your body parts are just drenched in sweat.

Yeah, it's miserable, isn't it?  And for some people it's medically  
necessary to have it.  But so what, for the rest of us?  Not compared to  
real misery -- which many of us (including myself) are really, really  
lucky never to have experienced.  It's a nice tool, but nothing is free.

&gt; I really think you have no idea what your saying when you say AC isn't a
&gt; necessity in the Southern US, it's the 21rst Century for Christ's sake,  
&gt; why
&gt; be a luddite?

As I said, I do know exactly what I'm talking about - sorry you missed my  
post.

As for luddites - while I know the everyday-language meaning of the word,  
you might find it really interesting to read up on the original Luddites  
and what they were fighting for.  They weren't all ignorant technophobes.   
They were fighting against a very specific and damaging application of a  
certain kind of technology.  I recommend Kirkpatrick Sale's &quot;Rebels  
Against The Future&quot;  
(http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201407183/102-1551290-2808114).

Recommending that one be conservative with technology is not luddism --  
although the marketeers behind the tech will try to paint it that way.   
Think genetically-engineered food may have a downside?  You're a luddite.   
etc.

Personally, as someone deeply immersed in online-instruction technology,  
as one of the few around the office who &quot;gets it&quot; regarding web tech, I  
think it's a hoot when someone calls me a luddite just because I suggest  
we not all go ga-ga over the latest Web Dingle.  I think you'll find that  
many of the most &quot;luddite&quot; people are the geeks who are early adopters.

&gt; AC done right doesn't have to cost a lot of $$$ or be complicated to get  
&gt; and
&gt; keep running, or at least it shouldn't be for anyone who's already  
&gt; capable
&gt; of keeping a 30+ year old VW bus running.

Very true - I'm considering a gilmore unit for my bus and the tech  
certainly doesn't scare me (I helped install a dealer DPD unit years  
ago).  And it's reasonably cheap.  But I sure don't want that to cause me  
to turn into someone who's dependent on AC, who can't imagine living  
without it.  That seems more limiting than freeing; it doesn't feel like  
&quot;progress&quot; to me.  I've been bitten on the ass one too many times like  
that -- after all, I grew up as part of the TV generation.  And I confess  
I'm overdependent on microwave ovens.  Fortunately, I still go camping  
often enough that I can cook food with fire. :-)

&gt; I think this discussion borders on ludditism... I see very few operating
&gt; buses in SWFL, the ones I do see are garage queens that get out on a few
&gt; weekends and that's it. The heat and lack of AC options has plenty to do
&gt; with that I'm sure.

You know what I think?  If not having AC is keeping someone from driving a  
bus, I don't want that person driving a bus.  Buses are not about creature  
comforts.  If I wanted that, I'd buy a Honda Element, etc.  It would make  
so much more sense.

&gt; Rust didn't kill all the buses down here, A few lucky ones escaped to he
&gt; west and the rest got sent to the crusher because a big old metal van
&gt; without AC is worthless in FL... (Unless you already work hard outdoors  
&gt; and
&gt; need a work van, but that's what old V-8 Ford, Chevy's, Dodges etc vans  
&gt; are
&gt; for. I haven't seen a old VW bus pulling &quot;work van&quot; duty since the
&gt; eighties.)

No, man, I'm not following your logic.  My bus isn't worthless, nor are  
the unairconditioned buses of many FL listees.  Keep your eyes open and  
see if I'm not right.  The main reasons they're not work trucks more often  
is that they're becoming collectible (and thus growing too valuable) and  
they're pretty underpowered for what most trucks are used for, at least on  
our contemporary Interstates.

&gt; As for the extra load on the engine, the AC has an on/off switch and you
&gt; should have an engine temp gauge in your bus anyway right? It the motors  
&gt; to
&gt; hot it's siesta time.

Very good suggestions!  Hope I can find an air-conditioned place to take  
my siesta. :)

&gt; Florida without AC is just a big flat hot humid mosquito infested swap!
&gt; AC
&gt; is not a luxury here, living without it along some mosquito infested  
&gt; stream
&gt; bank, like the indians and european settlers did, was pure hell!

Spoken like someone who truly and deeply loves the place he's living in.   
Wow.  You got that Disston Dredge working again? I'll bet you're pretty  
worked up about that silly Everglades Restoration thing, too.  Maybe you  
were joking.  Hoo, boy - where to start?  Go to the public library and  
check out some books on Florida history, starting with William Bartram's  
&quot;Travels&quot;.  Read up on biology so you can understand the value of  
skeeter-haunted swamps (cf. marsh, wetland, etc.) and how people have  
interacted with them over history.  Many people (including my crazy  
ancestors, thank goodness) thought this place was paradise long before AC  
(and other modern conveniences) encouraged rampant overdevelopment.  If  
you're gonna live here, get to know the neighborhood.

If nothing else, switch from Recirc to Fresh Air every now and then.  It'd  
be a start.  ;-)

OK, I promise never to talk about A/C on the list again, unless it's to  
share my experiences with the various units sold by dealers to fit on VWs.  
:-)  Speaking of which, here's a pic of the westy unit's interior  
component from my '71:  
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/71westy/71westy4.jpg.  The unit under  
the jumpseat had a label &quot;Volkswagen Products Corp.&quot; and the controls were  
on the side of the driver's seat pedestal.
