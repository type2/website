Subject: re: oil temp...

&gt; in Portland, Or. with all the overheating/poor running problems) never
&gt; mentioned where her temp sensor was located. Therefore, without this
&gt; knowledge anyone saying 225 degrees Fahrenheit is too hot was

D'oh! mine's where the dipstick was. And, btw, it's kinda loose in there,
I'd like to figure out a way to hold it better, the thing about using a

Well, if you know your altitude, then you can determine at what temp your
water actually boils.

&gt; &gt; &gt;117 degrees (yes, that's FAHRENHEIT, folks!!!) outside and pulling
&gt; &gt; &gt;over to let the engine cool was not an option, so I pressed on.
