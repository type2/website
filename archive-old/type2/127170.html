Subject: Re: [T2] Composite Drum on '71 rear?

&gt; Good Friday to All!  I'm trying to get the drums off of the rear of my '71.  I
&gt; believe it to be an early '71.  Could someone tell me if ALL '71s have
&gt; composite drums, or if maybe the early ones still require the removal of the
&gt; axel nut?  It has the two little bolts that have been removed, but the drum
&gt; does NOT seem like it's coming off the center for anything!  It's soaking in
&gt; Liquid Wrench now and I've been smacking it with a rubber mallet.    Any other
&gt; suggestions?  Bentley simply says &quot;remove two bolts and remove drum&quot; or
&gt; something to that effect.  THANKS!!

They can be very tight!  If your drums had the retaining screws, they are
composite drums.

More penetrating oil, perhaps some heat, and persistant tapping and
wiggling.

You could remove the axle nut and take the hub off with the drum for more
vigorous massage.

Once the drum is off the hub, clean the mating surfaces with fine
sandpaper and apply a film of anti-sieze to prevent future corrosion.
Make sure the drum slides on and off easily before you reinstall it.
