Thank you for your parts inquiry. The thermostat for your 76 VW bus(type II) is part number 021-119-159A and is available via special order thru Volkswagen of America.

Special orders must be pre-paid. So feel free to contact me.

Thank You.

This came as a result of my inquiry to a local dealer via www.vw_dot_com as recommended by snoopy. Don't want to start another hairy thread, just wanted to pass the info.

Billy
