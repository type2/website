ZR72 and All,

Ok, I was the one who accused Amsoil of being made by Amway. My bad.
BUT....it (the company) still operates much the same as Amway.... Damn
good oil, though!! At least I guessed Amsoil;-)

I have a few other comments about using synthetics though, so if
interested, read on....

&gt; ok ok ok ok ok everyone calm down.  i have been bombarded with an
enormous
&gt; amount of mail.....&lt;SNIP&gt;  a guy named al
&gt; amatuzio started the company in 1972.  he decided that since the FAA
ruled
&gt; that is was the law to only install and use synthetic oils in jet
engines
&gt; there must be a reason for that.  ( to this day all jet engines are
reguired
&gt; by law to use synthetic oils and greases.  this is not a baseless
statement, i
&gt; work in the airline industry and know this to be true.)  

Yes, but an engine failure in a jetliner would be a *bit* more
catastrophic than in a car;-) Also, a jet-turbine rotates at MANY
times the RPM's of even a top-fuel dragster. Higher RPM's=Higher
operating temps. 
There are many redundacies in the airline industry and for good
reason; it's bad PR to have a plane-load of people fall from the sky
because someone got cheap on the oil!!!! 


&gt;back to the
&gt; story......he developed an oil that blew away the competition in
performance,
&gt; metal particle shear factors, volitility, heat break down ...etc.
etc.  heres
&gt; a fact to think about....take a qt. of your favorite oil and one of
amsoil and
&gt; set them outside in the snow overnite.  open the caps and tip them
upside
&gt; down....your regular one will be sludgy and thick ...while amsoil
runs free.
&gt; take those same 2 qts. and heat them to 600 degrees.  yours will
have began
&gt; boiling away in as little as 290degrees while amsoil synthetics stay
complete
&gt; until reaching the 600 mark. 

This is all true and I can't/won't argue.

&gt;the
&gt; worst synthetic is better than the best petroleum oil.  

Again, I agree.

&gt;hmm...wonder why so
&gt; many car manufacturers are putting it in the engines and trannies
from the
&gt; factory?? 

Here, I have to disagree. I think modern car companies WANT their
motors to last. Think back to the US in the late '70s-early '80s when
American manufacturers' motors lasted 100,000 miles (at best) before a
rebuild. Then along came a whole slew of imports (mostly Japanese)
that were efficient, innexpensive AND lasted well past the 100,000
mile mark.

Also, most new car buyers sell their cars long before the 100,000 mile
mark these days. It's all about marketing hype-&quot;gotta have the newest
look or the boss and friends will think you're a loser, not to mention
the spouse&quot;. Look at how much more popular leasing is than buying.
People rent now.

I think the real reason they don't use synthetic oils and lubes is the
cost. An additional $40.00 in production cost would easily make the
selling price several hundred higher. 

&gt;did you know that by changing to
&gt; synthetics you save gas mileage also.  example....average syn.oil
change cost
&gt; is about $40.  your gas mileage increases on an average of 2-3 mpg.  

Hmmmmm....I guess I should be from Missouri (the &quot;show-me-state&quot;),
'cause I'd like to see some data from an un-biased laboratory to prove
that. 

----But, I'll let that slide, since I have no contrary data of my own! 


&gt;by only
&gt; increasing ONE mpg you save $72 a year. synthetics pay for
themselves in that area alone.  

Ok, let's do the math....

Let's say you drive 12,000 miles per year, your normal
fuel-consumption is 15mpg (which is true of my '69 Westy) and gas is
at a constant price of $1.00/gallon. Oil changes at every 3,000 miles.
Also, figure in that &quot;normal oil consumption for a VW&quot;, per my owners
manual, is 1.7-4.8 pints per 1,000 miles; we'll use a quart per 1,000
miles for comparison. Again, for the sake of comparison, we'll use
$1.85 per quart of regular oil and $4.75 per quart of synthetic. We'll
also say the fuel savings with synthetic is 1.5 mpg.

Here's how it works out for one yar on regular oil:

Gas: $800.00
Oil changes and consumption: 2.5 qts x 4 oil changes + 12 qts of
consumption = 22 qts total at a cost of $40.70
 Total cost of oil and fuel $840.70

Now for synthetic:

Gas: $720.00
Oil changes/consumption: $104.50
Total cost:$824.50 

Total savings of $16.20, but this is only THEORETICAL. The MPG savings
has yet to be proven and none of this is scientific.

Still, I agree that synthetic oils ARE superior to regular oils, but
that using &quot;facts&quot; that are not followed up with un-biased statistical
data to sell them is the same as &quot;Slick-50&quot;s marketing scam; the facts
simply DO NOT bear out the claims.

I think the better way to market ANY oil or additive is to show
UN-BIASED statistical &lt;empirical&gt; data that proves longer engine life.
I have yet to see that.

One last thing to ponder: The military, contrary to popular belief,
does NOT willingly waste money; they have to fight for every dollar
they get. They have spent literally millions of dollars on testing
oils and additives &lt;if they get even a few 100 miles more out of EVERY
motor, they save many millions of dollars on their budget&gt;. Because of
this testing, they use SOME synthetics, but mostly regular oils. They
also found that when properly filtered, oil can last as long as 50,000
miles with regular filter changes!!!


A few months ago, someone on the list gave the URL to a site that gave
a lot of stats on this stuff, anyone remember what the URL was?
