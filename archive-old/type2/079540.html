&gt;Hey all-
&gt;As long as the subject of heat is going around....
&gt;I have recently finished my installation of a
&gt;fantastic type 1 motor in to my 72 Westie.  One issue
&gt;I am running into however is the heater boxes.  It is
&gt;starting to get cold here in Wisconsin.
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that the cables that run from the cab
&gt;to the heater boxes and work the flaps mount on the
&gt;opposite side of the boxes than on the new motor.  Has
&gt;anyone else run into this problem?  Is is possible to
&gt;reroute those cables?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks everybody.

Ciao!
