Subject: bug-out 37 (manassas) report

Hey all,
Today Christy (my girlfriend) and I went to Manassas for the annual
bug-out.  It turned out to be very cool.  Lots of bugs, lots of ghias, lots of
type IIIs, one 412 (wow, I had never seen one of those before, looked
like a big squareback).  Also, many buses, westys, and Vanagons.  

My favorite of the show was a '76 German army double cab.  It was
painted that flat olive green, and so were the hubcaps.  I believe the
wheels were painted black.  It had big honkin' off-road tires on it and a
regular upright engine.  It had little clips around the headlights where you
could install a fabric cover if you wanted to.  Inside, on the driver's side
right up next to the windshield was a rifle, and under the dash on the
pass. side was a first aid kit and a fire extinguisher.  It had olive green
canvas on the back, which rolled up on the sides if you desired.  It was
incredible.  I really want one of those :) .

Also there and very nice was a completely stock '59 bus.  It was
beautiful, looked like it was brand new.  

Lots of late breadloaf Westys and Vanagon Westys, more splittie
campers int he parking lot than in the show.  Some very nice vintage
bugs, some disgusting bajas (yuck), and the water-cooled section which
I stayed out of :) .  Many vendors, I found some good stuff.  I got a nice
VW hat, a European country sticker (white oval with D on it) and a
plastic model kit of a 1967 Beetle.  I asked if they had any bus models
and they did but they were sold out :( .  They had a model of a '66 bug as
well, and a Karmann Ghia.  My girilfriend strategically separated from me
and bought me some more cool VW stuff for my birthday, which is
coming up next week.  

I had a good time, it was a nice show.  Huge compared to the Dinwiddie
bug-out last semester.

Sean
