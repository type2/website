&gt;I have a 72 van that needs the nose replaced. All the replacement panels

&gt;Has anyone been able to &quot;massage&quot; the panel to make it look original? If so, 
&gt;what did you have to do?

Did you read my earilier post?

I don't think you can remove the hump easily with some cutting and welding. If you have $500 you can eliminate the hump altogether and only have to deal with the turn signals if you buy a Genuine VW German nose. Search eBay for 7901009737.
