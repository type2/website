It started as list only.... then search engines and word of mouth gave fuel
to the fire.

AIRS http://www.type2_dot_com/rescue
P.S. is there anyone on the border of the neigboring states of North Dakota
(MT,SD,MN) , that would be willing to sign up for ND to drive out and help
anyone stranded? or just serve as an emergency contact? if so lemme know.
Its the only US state without a member.
P.S.S. I am workin on an easy print out for AIRS.

&gt;Just a question for everyone who has helped out someone.  Were they from
the
&gt;list?  I've had 3 people contact me and I did some welding/fabrication for
one
&gt;and none had ever heard of the &quot;list&quot;.
