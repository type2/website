Subject: Re: I NEED JUNK!

There was another New England list member that wanted the information on 
Bus/VW junkyards. Unfortunately I lost the original message. Here it is:


John, 
   You're in luck my friends wife called about a problem with the ir van and 
I got the phone # for the place on the Cape It's called Bugs Busses and 
Things in Hyanis(sp?) (508) 778 4300 and I'm pretty sure this is the place I 
went to in VT Bus Heaven (782) 293-4500
