Subject: ] Head removal on type 4 2000cc

I have done it both ways...........my decision at the time was based on
necessity.  Once I dropped a valve in Florida, 500 miles from home, luckily
near a relatives house with a dirt driveway and few tools..............he
loaned me his GEO Tracker to get back home.  Now when I came back, I came
armed with tools and a head.

He had no garage so to speak that we could work on an engine, and the ground
was really soft, so I decided to pull tin and remove the head with the
engine still in the car.  Took about 2 hours and i was off and running.

I have repaired a customers car in a parking lot, 30 miles from home using
the same method.

Preferred method is to pull the engine, though, for then the opportunity is
there to inspect and repair rear seals, push rod tube seals, clutch, and
other things when i put the motor on the stand.  Worth the extra time in my
opinion, for you may just fix a few other things before they break!
