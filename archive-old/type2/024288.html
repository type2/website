Subject: Best windshield seal for '71?
Message-ID: &lt;7jn0mn$t2pn_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Wanted peoples opinion on who sells the best quality/fitting windshield seal for my '71 Westfalia? 
Also, is it a real tough job to replace?  I have heard some people say to use various different sealers along with the new seal to ensure a water tight result.  Can anyone offer suggestions?
Thank you,
Matt
