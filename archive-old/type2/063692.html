Subject: VW Cartoon...

Listy Scott Catlin (Scott.Catlin_at_sierra_dot_com) has a way excellent VW cartoon
scanned. Color. Youse splitty peple would love it. It's in Macintosh .pict
format, don't know whether he can convert it to something lesser machines
can read. Maybe if you ask he'll send it to you.
