Subject: Lights on, no radio

A few weeks ago i posted a message about the highbeams not working in 
my '71 Westy. The solution was to replace the relay with P/N 
111-941-583, and solder a jumper from pin 30 to pin 56.

I got the part from Bus Depot this morning, and did the soldering. I 
popped the relay into the fusebox, powered up the bus and sure enough 
my highbeams work now! But now, when the lights are on [even on 
low-beam], the radio shuts off.

I tried a few variations to see if i could get it to work, but in all 
cases, the radio shuts down when the lights are powered on. here's 
what i tried:

1) relay with pins 30 &amp; 56 jumped, #30 pin up
2) relay with pins 30 &amp; 56 jumped, #30 pin bent down
3) relay with no jumpers, pin #30 up
4) relay with no jumpers, pin #30 bent down

So, does this sound like a problem with the fusebox, the relay, or 
the radio hookup? the radio is not stock, it's a CD player in my 
glovebox, and the wiring was done by the PO, so it's anyones guess as 
far as that's concerned.

is it possible that the stereo was accidentally connected to the 
circuit for the  lights?

if it helps any, i can take some digital photos of the setup and 
stick them on the web somewhere. i can deal with simple circuits, but 
the mess under my dash is not pretty.

hoping this is a known thing and there's a quick fix...
