Just a line to say that Cameron &amp; Denise are home now, still some concerns,
but think we're in the clear.

I would like to thank all you who sent well-wishing mail, it was a lift in
dark times for me &amp; for Denise who could read them off my Nokia Communicator
(Smug mode). It is great to get the thoughts &amp; prayers from around the
world!

As I said, thanks to you all, now I can get back to the Bus etc.
