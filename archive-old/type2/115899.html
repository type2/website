&gt; So what I am gathering here is that the Schadek is thought to be a nice
&gt; pump, Bob is getting great pressure from his Melling, the Schadek is $30
&gt; and aluminum and requires some mods to install along with a type 1 cover
&gt; plate and longer studs, the Melling is $70 and bolts right up but is cast
&gt; iron and theoretically could expand at a different rate than the case...

The melling will not bolt right up any easier than the schadek. Being both
type 1 30mm pumps, they are dimensionally similar and will require similar
mods to work. The mods required depend on the cam and gear combo.

What kind of cam and cam gear is in the motor right now? Is the gear bolted
to the cam or riveted?
