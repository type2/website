Subject: WTB: '78-ish camper interior
X-Mime: Produced by C I Host

I'm hunting a camper interior for a '78 or thereabouts to be installed in a '72. 
I would prefer to get the front seats as well, but I'm flexible.

I'm in Memphis, TN, but I don't mind driving for the right interior. As a matter
of fact, I'm planning a trip to the East Coast in early September and I'd be happy
to make a detour along the way.

I'm not in a really big hurry, so if you see a good one anywhere near here, please
keep me in mind!

Thanks!

Joe (joe_at_volks_dot_net)
