Nope, because the bus tin extends higher and wider than the bug tin.
However, the bug tin can be a starting point.  Simply fabricate a plate
from sheet metal that matches the old non-doghouse bus tin and then weld
or braze it to the bug tin.  This seems to be exactly what VW did on the
'71 bus.

&gt; &gt; An excellent idea.  You will have to scrounge up a few parts, but most of
&gt; &gt; them are readily available.  Since VW did this themselves, you are assured
&gt; &gt; of a well-engineered design.  The only tough part is the front tin, which
&gt; &gt; was only made in '71.  Other tin can be modified without too much trouble
&gt; &gt; to do the job.
