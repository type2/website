Subject: Me again

Hi Volks!

Some of you might remember me.  I'm Erik Meltzer from the city
of the world's oldest Volkswagenwerk, Braunschweig/Germany,
the guy with the bunch of panel vans and the single Westy,
all of which aren't street legal and operable at the time
being.  I also used to be webmaster_at_bulli_dot_org, Germany's
Community of Interest T2 site, until recently.

Just wanted to say hello, and renew my old offer of assisting
with German language or other Germany-related questions.
I'm on digest mode and will try to keep up as well as I can. 
Personal mail is welcome.  It feels good to be back already.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
