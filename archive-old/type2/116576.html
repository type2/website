Subject: brake switches/DM

Dr Tim said:

&gt;But soon your troubles will be over, no more &gt;decisions to make. The German item will be NLA due &gt;to lack of justifiable sales and then the price of &gt;the junk will jump to $20, for the same $5 crap. &gt;That's reality. 

Dr. Tim is grouchy about standards lately, and that's okay, I believe he has high standards and wants the best for all of us, that's why he's here and I'm glad of it.  But as a member of &quot;us&quot; I'd like to bring it back towards the center for a minute.

Many of us acquire &quot;projects&quot; to be nice about it, and many of us are also saving abandoned buses for later that might've not made it at all.

I'm already in a grand for the '65 I bought just back in June. I can't justify $60 for brake switches when I don't have seatbelts yet. It's just the fact of the matter. We're all doing LOTS of things with our money besides driving VW's around. We're doing the best we can, that's why we're on the list.

Buy German when you can afford it or you really want to. Support the BUS SPECIFIC list vendors no matter what. Keep the bus running and fuctional whatever you have to do. 
Don't feel guilty for not being a German Engineer.

Billy
