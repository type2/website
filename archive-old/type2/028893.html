Congratulations to Shawn in Jackson MS, as he was the fastest to reply. The
correct answer was; Glitch in the Matrix: sympton:Deja Vu, cause:They
changed something. His price $10 coupon, good for the purchase of vw bus
parts at www.bustedvw_dot_com.

Agent Dave Type2 list admin says, &quot;According to the charter, surveys and
contests are fine on Friday as long as they have bus content..&quot; So here
goes. Every Friday starting today we'll post a bus related trivia question.
Correct entries will be pooled during the week and a winning entry will be
randomly selected on the following Friday. The winner will receive a
discount, coupon, or merchandise from BUStedVW. Here are some simple rules
just to get us started.

1. All entries must be posted at www.bustedvw_dot_com using our contact us form.
2. One entry per person please.
3. You must be a member of the type 2 list. (don't get your kids to add
entries unless there members too)
4. Please fill in all fields on the form including your shipping address.
(this only helps when placing an order, we never share your information or
mail you anything, other than the bus parts you've ordered)
5. Prices are only good for 1968-1979 bus parts. We specialize in used and
rebuilt parts, new items include anything from RMMW and WCM, and are limited
to in stock items. (As usual inquire about parts you don't find on our
catalog.)
6. All coupons and discounts are good only for store credit and cannot be
applied to tax or shipping.
7. Winners will be posted (first name, home town and state) to the list
every Friday along with the next weeks trivia question. As well each weeks
winner will receive a personal e-mail, letting them know they are that weeks
winners.

If you have any questions please contact me.
