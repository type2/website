Subject: RE: [T2] Really dumb newbie question .. Just checking ..

Bob Wrote ..

&gt;so it has a 1600 engine and not the 2000 liter engine???  I  know the 1600
was stock in Europe but I thought the 2000 was an option,  I would check
the 2000 does have a oil filter.&lt;

It's definatly a standard 1600 aircooled unit (we did look at some buses
with other engines but passed them by for ubiquity and cheapness of parts ..

&gt;fix it,  it is summer in the South of France and the engine could overheat&lt;

Ordered ..

&gt;I use synthetic in mine and have for many years, in a 1600 with no filter
I would continue to change at 3000 miles, in my 78 with a oil filter I
change before 5000 but usually after 4000&lt;

I've ordered the oil ..


&gt;I would still change fuel lines even if they &quot;say&quot; they are new, also buy
a fire extingueser anyway.&lt;

Oddly the only thing I knew about type twos utill I started my research for
this one is that &quot;They catch fire&quot;.   About 20 years ago I used to work for
the traffic department of Kent police and if the officers ever say a type
two parked at a services or broken down at the side of the road they would
chat to the owner about fuel lines.  If the owener didn't seem &quot;With the
program&quot; they would ask the owner if they could check them.     While I was
with them we had someone die in a type two fire.

I inspected the fuel lines and they look new and are E marked for unleaded
fuel and braided.   The fuel pump is also new ..
