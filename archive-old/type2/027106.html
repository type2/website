Hello.

I have 'scored' a side tent.

It seems to have all the poles, pegs, etc

It is used - but not abused.  (I haven't looked at the actual tent, but I 
can see that one of the screens has a few small tears in one of the 
screens.)

On the poles, one of the four top 3-tee pieces has been repaired (welded), 
so this is NOT a show quality tent.

And I do not expect show quality value.

I really, really, REALLY need a SAGE GREEN slider door, and two SAGE GREEN 
front doors, or my '78 is going to the grave yard in two years. Just as soon 
as it is due to become an antique, it will be lost because of rust on the 
doors and some minor body areas.

I would like to trade the tent for the 3 doors I need.

Barry sends  Springfield VA
