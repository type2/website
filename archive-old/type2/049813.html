Subject: [T2] Oil springs &amp; plungers

hey y'all
I'd like to put stock oil pressure &amp; control springs and plungers in the 
Express.  Who has a set for new brazilian cases they'd be willing to part 
with at reasonable cost?  I'd even trade 'high performance' springs &amp; 
plungers for stock.
