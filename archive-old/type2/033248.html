Subject: Bus Depot Westi cabinet handles and other comments.

Just ordered and received some new stuff from the Bus Depot, including the
poptop hold-down straps, a rear cargo door seal and one gray Westi cabinet
handle to replace a broken one.  All came in the time promised, the straps
were backorered and they had to substitute a Brazilian seal for the
sale-priced German model, but they called and told me this in advance.  Very
good service.

I will have to say, however, that the &quot;gray&quot; handles are not the right
color.  They're OK for me, as I'm not doing a ten point resto or anything, I
just want functionality.  But they are about eight shades of grey too light
to match the '68-'73 handles.  The black ones would be a better match, as
all of us that have an early loaf Westi know that it has &quot;grey-black&quot;
handles.

The straps are black, not the original white.  But then beggars can't be
choosy.  My old ones were in a sad state of repair.  Again, functionality
over originality.

I am pretty happy with the $35 rear hatch seal.  It isn't as pretty as the
intricately molded German model, but it seals the door and didn't cost $100.
Function before originality.  Notice a trend?

I'm very happy with my Bus Depot orders and with the service that I have
received.  I also like dealing with a small business.  But price is a
concern for me also, and that's why I've stayed with Bus Depot instead of
buying stuff from the local guy.

I highly recommend.
