Subject: Re: [T2] Higher temperatures during engine break in?

&gt; after 25 miles. I was using Pennzoil 30 weight oil during the break in. Does
&gt; anyone have any information as to whether this amount of temp increase is
&gt; normal for a new engine? If so, how long should it take to return to more
&gt; 'normal' levels?

Entirely normal.  It'll usually take at least a few thousand miles to
return to &quot;normal&quot;...and don't forget that &quot;normal&quot; may have changed if
your CR changed.

I've heard at least one report of close to 10k miles before a particularly
tight engine settled down.
