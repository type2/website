I followed a pretty extensive thread on the another elist recently and the
best advise I got was to look at 220v units.  Here an explanation why:

Subject: Re: &lt;VV&gt; Re: Volts/Watts/Amps 

An excellent example of the difference between current (amp) and power 
(watts). 
For a given power load, 220 v will need only 1/2 the current of the same 
wattage load on 110 v. Furthermore, since the voltage is double, and the 
current is half, you can tolerate 4 times the voltage DROP at 220 v before 
you see an equivalent reduction in performance, dimming, etc., that you
would 
see at 110 v. 
In other words, high power loads, if you have a choice, really want to be
fed 
at 220 v. My air compressor, welder, heat pump, etc., in my garage all are 
wired as such, and are a LOT happier for it!

&gt; Subject: [T2] Welders
&gt; 
&gt; Hey all,
&gt; I know the subject of welders has come up before, but I need to do a lot
&gt; of
&gt; welding on my 71 Westy and am getting a late Christmas present from my
&gt; wife.
&gt; She told me I could get a welder up to a certain dollar amount. I know
&gt; that
&gt; Miller, Lincoln, and Hobart are some of the best out there, but they are
&gt; too
&gt; much. Also I will not be useing it everyday just often. So, I found that
&gt; Campbell Hausfeld sells a wireweed/mig, with regulator for gas called the
&gt; 105. Does anyone have one of these? Do you know anything about them?
&gt; Regular
&gt; price is about $339, they have reconditioned ones for $229 online. Add the
&gt; price of the Bottle and thats about the price limit I have.
