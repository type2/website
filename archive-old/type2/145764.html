Subject: Re: [T2] new Mexican Longblocks?

I got mine installed and have almost 100 miles so far.  Mine came the same 
way, even had NGK spark plugs  ( I guess they didn't have any Bosch ones.. ;) ). 
I drilled and tapped it for full flow, and for the thermostat, and it runs 
like a champ.  I have dual Kadrons and a 009, but I'm going to get the carb 
tapped and put my SVDA on after New Years.
 
The best of luck with yours, but I know you will be just as happy as I am 
with mine!!  Happy New Year!!
