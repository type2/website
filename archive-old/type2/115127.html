Subject: Slip Streaming a Semi on I-95

I knew this was going to happen.

Look, this is a multi-national list and everything we post is a generalization in one way or another. 

Of course I don't think Jim's brother-in-law is a crankhead. But you know what? That doesn't mean they aren't out there. Jim could be a liar. His brother in law might work with two dozen cranksters. 

Don't tell me they're not out there, and don't get your personal panties in a bunch over a general safety post. It's not meant as in insult to you, it is relevant and truthful.

Billy

...And I have a brother-in-law and a son who are long haul truckers.  You overgeneralize, my friend.  You might know of what you speak in your family. Not in mine. The drivers in my family are courteous, 
PROFESSIONAL drivers.
