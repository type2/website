&gt; &gt; It sounds like you're talking about the EGR (Exhaust Gas
&gt; &gt; Recirculation)pipe
&gt; &gt; that runs from the EGR valve connected to the left front of the air
&gt; &gt; intake
&gt; &gt; distributor
&gt;
&gt; I've been wondering... just what is the point of the EGR valve anyway. I
&gt; don't see how it can recirculate enough 'unburned fuel' to make a
&gt; difference in the air quality- what can it recirculate.. 5%? and of
&gt; that, what is the percentage of unburned fuel?

The EGR valve allows burned exhaust gas [inert] back into the combustion
chamber. This is done to lower the temperature in the combustion chamber to
lower NOX emissions. Oxides of nitrogen is formed when combustion temps
exceed 2000 degrees F.
