Hi,

I'd try creative caulking using black RTV.  Use an RTV
like the GE stuff that turns into hard rubber.  The
creative part is trying to &quot;mask&quot; off the area where
this new RTV gasket will fit.  You're trying to get a
buildup of an eighth of an inch of RTV to grab the
windshield and cover the pin holes.  RTV sticks like
crazy after it cures for 24 hours, but it's real easy
to end up with a mess unless you carefully smooth it. 
Theoretically RTV should last 25 years, but scraping
the windshield in the winter will probably wear this
gasket out after a few years.  Before you cover those
rust holes with RTV, scrape away the loose rust and
force something like Rustoleum rust reformer under the
old gasket and everywhere there is rust.

Rob
