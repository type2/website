I use Coca-cola Classic.
I actually cleaned my entire engine last night with a 12pack of coke. I was
thinking of writing a letter to the company thanking them for making a
product that is so toxic it can break up goop that is 30+yrs old. Man am I
glad I don't drink it though imagine what it would do to your stomach if it
can degrease a VW engine.

&gt; I would try citric acid. A proprietory product called &quot;GooGone&quot; is
&gt; available. There are other similar products. Also, you might try &quot;Bug and
&gt; Tar Remover&quot; by Turtle Wax. Neither will hurt your paint. Even kerosene
&gt; might do the job.

&gt; &gt;So, what gets 26 year old back gunky glue off of paint, without stripping
&gt; &gt;the paint in the process?
