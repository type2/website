The second thing I look for on a candidate for purchase is evidence of
proper procedures or lack thereof which will have to be restored for proper
function. If there is cut and file and quicky splices and bogus quicky
terms evident on a new battery I have spent no more than 5 minutes to know
to walk away. The first thing I look for takes 2 minutes (rust). If it's
dirt cheap it could be useful as a donor of some good parts. The ones the
PO's never layed their hands on. Those at least might be good for cores. If
it meets these first tests, then I might spend 2 hours to determine the
factual functions and conditions evident by acutal inspection. Only then
will I have a sense of what it might be worth to me.

I've been where you are James. That's how most of us learn. We all start
out as newbies.
