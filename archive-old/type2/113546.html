&gt; &gt; The Fuch alloy is designed to hold up with no flex at all in 4 wheel drift

&gt; &gt; bus chassis without falling over.
&gt;
&gt;How about a loaded bus hitting a significant rock, or a hole in the road
&gt;that bottoms the suspension?

The suspension and chassis will bend before the Fuchs. Typical of racing 
Porsches that got shunted was bent suspension and wheels in spec and 
re-useable. If you bend a Fuchs wheel in a crash, expect they will need the 
big can opener to get the driver out. Much lighter and much stronger than 
steel. The less unsprung mass, the less bottoming out. You could pound on a 
Fuchs with a tie rod all day long and just create tiny dimples in the wheel 
but bent the tierod into knots.

&gt;  This will put a much larger load on a bus
&gt;wheel than a bug or Porsche wheel.

Compare pressures created by a 2000 lbs vehicle at 160 miles per hour with 
a 4000 lb vehicle at 65. Simple proportions will show you that the lighter 
car at higher speed is loading the wheels far more than the heavier vehicle 
at highway speed.


&gt;I've never seen a wheel damaged from side loads.  It's always impact loads
&gt;that do them in.

Sliding sideways into a curb and take your pick. Bent wheel or tear the 
suspension mounts out. That's the trade off, due solely to the far greater 
strength of the Fuchs forged alloy and rigid design.
