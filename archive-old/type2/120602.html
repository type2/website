&gt;I had a leak at the gasket but it turns out it was at

&gt;My local shop tried to weld over it but it still
leaks
&gt;Looks like I need a new used one.

&gt;Anyone out there have one for cheap?

Hello Mike,
I have a good oil filler tube from my old 73 bus
engine some where boxed up. Give me your address and I
will send it to you the first chance I get. I don't
remember if I still have the plastic top and cap for
it or not. If I do I will send those as well. I don't
want anything for it but if you would like, paypal or
send a $5.00 donation to the type 2 list and I will
mail it to you A.S.A.P.

Thanks and have a great day!

Regards,
David Kelly
