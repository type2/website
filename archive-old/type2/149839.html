&gt; I have a new vaccum advance dizzy from cip1 and am trying to figure
&gt; out the vaccum advance cut off.

The cutoff came on some 72-74 buses. It required a switch on the
transmission to activate it in 4th gear. If you don't have that nosecone
there's no point in hooking it up.

However, that device makes the engine run hot by eliminating advance in the
lower 3 gears. Bad idea.

&gt; Di I have one, did I not? Where should
&gt; I be looking, are there any pictures on the web?
&gt;
&gt; Re fitted carbs, pdsit 2/3, will be arriving soon, where does the
&gt; retard port connect to?

Both questions depicted here here:

You'll need to block the retard port on the carb with a rubber cover.
