Subject: blower keeps blowing inline fuse

merry christmas and happy new year everyone,

seeing as it is cold in saint louis, mo, i desperately need my blower motor
to work for some sembelence of less coldness.  my question is, do i need a
new blower?  the in-line fuse keeps on blowing, unlike the motor.  all
connetions and wires up to the fuse appear solid and uncomprised, no cross
connections or other bad things.  the squirrel cage is slightly difficult to
hand turn and seems to catch occasionly (sp).  i took it inside to work on
and was able to get it to turn more freely.  when reattached it whined as it
spun then quickly blew two more 16 amp fuses.  so, new blower motor or look
for shorts elsewhere.  all the other fuses are fine.  i lean towards a new
blower motor but seek guidence from those wiser and more expierenced in Bus
Lore.


thanks in advance and all the applicable season's greetings,


jeremiah and goethe the two-tone bullet (75 engine, 77 body)
