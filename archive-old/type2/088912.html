Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical woes... still

One milliamp draw is .001 amp. Not enough to kill a battery. Are you sure they
did not mean 100ma?  [.100 amp] 100ma will drain a battery down after about a
week.
I am afraid they will not find a 1ma draw......

From: &quot;David Maurio&quot;
&gt; Update...
&gt;
&gt; Well... she's been at the mechanics for almost 2 weeks now... they have
&gt; found nothing so far.  They're telling me that there's a 1 milliamp draw and
&gt; they can't find it, they're down to unplugging circuits one by one trying to
&gt; find it... argh.  It's driving me nuts, at least when it was here I could
&gt; mess with it myself, but having it be there so long is really starting to
&gt; worry me...  I hope they find SOMETHING, I mean what are my options if they
&gt; can't find anything?
