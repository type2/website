Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tire hold down?

Hi.
My 73 has the strap type hold down like the one George described.
While we're talking about this, I'm doing the same relocation of the spare.
The 73 doesn't have the hard plastic cover, but a vinyl covering, isn't that
correct? Are they available? And what type emblem, if any did the 73 Westy
have on the front? Did it use the same type of fasteners as the Bugs? I see
no provision for the emblem on the front of my bus.
Thanks,

Tom

&gt; Hiya Grant,
&gt;
&gt; Like so many other parts on our Busses the particulars of your spare tire
&gt; hold-down device will depend on the production year of your Bus.
&gt;
&gt; George sent you a description of the securing system for later Baywindows.
&gt; In the earlier models (mine is a 70) the securing system consisits of two
&gt; pieces.  One is a convoluted bolt which threads through a plate.  The
plate
&gt; holds the wheel in place while the bolt is run into the side of the body
and
&gt; screwed tight.
&gt;
&gt; Truth be told, I've been operating without either the bolt or the plate
and
&gt; everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle around, make noise, or
&gt; pose any threat of escaping.  And with the plastic cover in place, who
will
&gt; ever know?
&gt;
