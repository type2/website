Subject: Re: 68-71 Tow hitch

Ian,

I just custom fabbed a trailer hitch for my '68.  Pulled a camping trailer
from Pittsburgh to Assateague Island and back.  It worked out real well.
It bolts to the frame using those mysterious (3)10mm taps on each side of
the frame rails, and then wraps under / around the body to up inside the
bumper.  No drilling or hacking of the bus what-so-ever, which was real
appealing to the &quot;I'm going to restore this thing, someday&quot; in me.  A real
clean look when installed, too!  I could take pictures if you like.  The
plates that actually bolt to the frame I had waterjetted out of 1/4 thick
steel, where I work, for a small fee.  I could get you that cad geometry,
if you like.  I could whip up some drawings to manufacture to if you would
like.  If you or anyone is interested, let me know.  I'll go from there.  I
could get some made, for sale, if there is interest, but they may be kinda
heavy to ship... but possible...
Let me know, and thanks!

Mark

&lt;Anyone have one that would like to part with or know of one? Or anyone
&lt;making them? Or Do you have one I coulds use to fab my own?
