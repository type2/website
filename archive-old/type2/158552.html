&gt; What's up with people that a) put a Westy side tent up for auction and 
&gt; want $1000 for it and b) people who bid $810 and don't get it.  I  don't get
&gt; it!  Are these people crazy or what?  And I thought  $200 was a lot for a
&gt; stool.  What kind of cult have I gotten  myself into here?  Jeez...KR

   Priced any ol' Jag parts lately...?-(
Any &quot;collectable&quot; car reaches this price point eventually...Someone
wants an &quot;original&quot; piece for a restoration and the few pieces rise to
whatever the traffic will bear...Almost all cars trace an inverted bell
curve in pricing...Depreciating most when newest and starting back
up again at about 20 years or so after production stops...Even a car
like the Citroen 2 CV (French equivalent of the Beetle) commands
high prices today...
    Priced any oddball pieces for early Beetles lately...?-(

If I were crazy enough to do it, I'd bet you could buy one of the &quot;nou-
veau&quot; T-Birds and put it in a sealed container for twenty years and
it'd be worth mega bucks... ;-)
