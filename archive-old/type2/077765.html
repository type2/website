&gt; If, somehow, the displacement of the 1800cc heads was

&gt; compression ratio.

We're talking about 'chamber volume' here, not displacement.  Chamber
volume affects only the compression ratio.  Displacement is just what it
sounds like.  Measure the volume of the cyliner at bottom dead center.
Measure the volume of the cylinder at top dead center.  Subtract the
second number from the first number and multiply the result by the
number of cylinders. Product equals 'displacement'.  Otherwise known as
'swept volume'.

As an example (without using graduated cylinders to pour liquids):

pi x radius of bore squared (remember your geometry? Area of a circle) x
stroke x # of cylinders = displacement. 

A smaller chamber volume will result in a higher compression ratio than
a larger chamber. A longer stroke without moving the cylinders further
out (shims under the cylinder bases) will result in both a larger
displacement and a higher compression ratio.
