I know this may not be the best (seasonal) time to post this... but I
need to clear some stuff out...

I've an overhead air conditioning unit that came out of a 73 bus.  This
is the overhead unit, and the plastic piece to run down the inside wall
of the bus to cover the hoses (which were cut).  I also have a
compressor that would fit on a T4 engine...don't know the condition of
it...as it was in a fire...
But....the price on this....  FREE
Come pick it up... I'm in WI.  If interested ...email me.  Its possible
I could be talked into driving a little ways to meet someone if really
interested.

Isaiah
