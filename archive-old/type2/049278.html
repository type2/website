slip a 8&quot; section of 1/2&quot; rubber hose over the end of the plug to start the
plug in the head, then use a ratchet and socket (WITHOUT the rubber insert)
to finish it off.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt;     I assume I am not alone in my new found hatred for the #2 plug.
Changing
&gt; the plugs on my '77 went well 'til I got to #2. Got it out fine, could NOT
&gt; get the new plug in, working by feel of course, 'cause you can't see a
damn
&gt; thing. To make matters worse, the plug socket with the plug in it fell off
&gt; the extension, and is now somewhere between the tin and the head. I've
been
&gt; at this ONE plug for over an hour now, and am losing patience quickly. Any
&gt; suggestions?   TIA, Jeff S
&gt; .
