Subject:    re:premium vs tolerence

Im not one to say anything about anything. I like to read the list and ask
?'s Im not in the ranks of actually answring any as of yet (smile) But Ive
always wondered the same thing. I friend told me the engine required it. Now
I know diff. I appreciate the ? wether its been posted b4 or not. Thats why
we are all here as stated in some recent posts,to teach and ask and learn. I
find it odd that the only people that answrd the ? for the most part were
the same people who were sick of the thread and the ? but didnt see fit to
send the response to the sender. Is it more staisfying to send in to
hundreds of people stating what a dumb ? it was? Or did you think that other
people wanted to know the correct response? If you chose the latter then
your response could do with out the ridicule.If you chose the first then we
could all do without your repsonse at all.
Sometimes we lose sight of what this list represents. We all know we should
read the archives first, sometimes we dont think of it right off hand.
So it goes.....
