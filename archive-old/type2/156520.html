Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Fire Survial

Hi Dino,

Glad to hear the fire didn't get too far before you noticed it. Oil and 
plastic
above the exhaust is a potential for trouble. Replace the seal ASAP.

As for the performance issues... I think you're on the right track. Verify the
ignition first: dwell and timing will drastically impact performance and worn
points will affect both. Once you have verified those then move on to a valve
adjustment and a compression test. If the compression is OK then look for a
vaccuum leak... dual carb setups are not immune to this problem.

Happy trails,
