Phil:

Even if the vehicle comes up stolen, ya think the PO will *really* want
to retrieve it? I'll go pick it up! I'll go! Driving it back could be a challenge....

Supposedly, the California Department of Motor Vehicles
(http://134.186.4.210/dmv.htm) can do a title history for your vehicle
for free. However, I'm durned if I can find the information on their web
site (I'd been meaning to research this for myself, thanks for the noodge).

Here's what I did find:

How long CA DMV keeps vehicle records:
http://134.186.4.210/faq/genfaq.htm#BM2550

How to contact CA DMV:
http://134.186.4.210/contacts/contacts.htm

If anyone knows more specifics on this, please p-mail me.

Good luck!

Nikki

&gt; And secondly. Is there some form of stolen car register I can check against
&gt; in California?
&gt; (I'm always a little paranoid about new purchases! I'm sure there's no need
&gt; though).
