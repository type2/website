Does anybody have a how-to to remove the windshield WITHOUT breaking the 
window? I plan to put it back in after the restoration. I'm not worried 
about the gasket as it's going to be replaced anyway. I was cutting into the 
gasket down the middle of it where the edge of the glass stops inside. Looks 
like it should just pop out after that. Am I doing it right or is there a 
better/easier way?

Thanks
Dave
