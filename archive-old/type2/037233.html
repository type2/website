Hey yall, I have a '77 westy, and I am puzzled.  Here's the scoop:

It starts great and will run fine for maybe 30 seconds to a minute, then
with out any warning it will die.  There is no sputter or cough, just like
I had turned off the key.  I can start it right back up but it will do the
same thing but it will run for a slightly shorter time.  It doesn't matter
what engine speed its at, it will die just like I turned the key.  My
first thought was FI, but I now think that its ignition because it acts
like it just looses spark all at once.  Could it be a relay?  I have
changed the fuel filter, done plugs points/condencer and timing but now
realize that it will take a lot of work.  I checked all the archives and
could not find anyone with the same problem.  

I have been checking everything I can, however the rear end on my volvo
122 is &quot;talking&quot; like it is jealous and wants some attention too.  With
one rig down, one on the way, and tax day looming on the horizon, I am
getting worried.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  


Thanks, Marcus
