If it be of your own free will and accord, you are hereby accepted as an
entered apprentice in the Royal and Ancient Order of Neandereers.

As an apprentice, you will be shown the tools of the Neandereer, and taught
how to use them. You must take an obligation to only use them in the manner
in which you were shown. You must also vow not to  reveal the secrets of
their use to the profane, Bozos and boobs and such. There will be many
trials and tribulations. If you pass unharmed, you will be allowed to
progress through the higher degrees which lead to the title of Neandereer.

Way to go Nikki.
