Subject: '78 Westy firewall removal?

Alright, finally making progress on the &quot;little&quot; mechanical things. 
Fixed the stumble/miss, replaced all the overflow/vent lines from the
gas tank (that I can get to, see below for the rest), checked all the
fuel lines and clamps, replaced some vacuum lines and a cracked hose to
the decel valve.  Engine seems to run cooler now, thinking one of the
hoses had caused a vacuum leak and the engine was running a little on
the lean side under load.

Anyway, I've reduced the gas fume smell but it's still there so I think
it's time to pull the firewall and deal with the filler neck and the
other vent hose couplings.  I attempted to remove it today at work to no
avail.  Removed the screws on the sides and didn't see anything else
holding it in, except for 3 tabs along the top.  It appears someone
painted the engine bay and so part of the firewall is stuck, but this is
some serious stuck.  Is there a trick?  Does the bottom pop out first or
the top (bend the tabs?)?  Did I miss something holding it in place? 
Would be nice to get the last couple of drivetrain items taken care of,
then I can take my time on the other things.  Any pointers?

Thanks again, might actually take the family camping this weekend. 
We'll see!  It'd be her maiden campout.  Woohoo!
