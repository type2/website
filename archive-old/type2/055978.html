Subject: &quot;Gene Berg Memorial Cruise&quot;...

Hello all,

Hey Bus owners!  The Cascade Kombi's (a NEATO Chapter) will 
be hosting the 17th Annual Northwest Vintage Show at Shoreline 
Community College on July 18th.  It's one of the best VW shows 
anywhere, especially for Bus attendance, and has an awesome 
swap meet too.  Since a bunch of you may already be planning to 
head to Seattle for this great weekend of shows, perhaps you'd 
enjoy meeting up with and joining in on a great VW caravan which 
starts in So. Cal and will end up at Seattle Thursday evening.  You 
can join up wherever you'd like, or at least drop by to check it out 
as it passes thru.  

As an on-going tribute to Gene Berg, the &quot;Cruise&quot; came about to 
showcase the fact that well built VW's, whether Vintage, stock or 
high performance, could reliably drive anywhere and do it with ease.  
But of course, it never hurts to be around other knowledgeable VW 
enthusiasts on a long cross-country drive, just in case.

I was honored this year to be asked by Bill Collins to co-drive his 
incredible red and cream Okrasa powered 1949 Hebmueller as 
the lead vehicle in the cruise.  You can bet I took him up on that offer!  
The core group of this years &quot;Gene Berg Memorial National Cruise&quot; 
will leave Gene Berg Enterprises in Orange, CA (714) 998-7500 on 
Tuesday morning, July 14th.  The VW's will basically follow I-5 up the 
center of the state to Sacramento where at 6pm &quot;Bugformance&quot; will 
host a Berg Cruise Social.  The Cruise will overnight at the Best 
Western Sandman Motel in Sacramento.

On Wed. morning the Berg Cruise participants will leave after breakfast 
and continue on I-5 thru the beautiful scenery of Northern California and 
into Oregon.  We'll be picking up more participants along the way and 
will overnight in Eugene, OR at the Best Western Greentree Inn.  

On Thursday morning after breakfast the Berg Cruisers will stop after 
only 44 miles for a Berg Cruise Social hosted by the House of Ghia in 
Albany, OR at 9am.  At 11am we cruise on for 70 miles to our second 
Berg Cruise Social hosted by Strictly German Autowerks in Portland, OR 
at around noon.  Later we mount up and head for the WA border and 
follow I-5 on up to Seattle.  The host hotel there is the Best Western 
Choicelodge in Kent, WA.

On Friday morning, the Berg Cruiser's are invited to prep their cars for 
the weekend after the long drive at Autovice Import Specialists in 
Lynwood, WA who have graciously offered their facilities to the Cruise 
participants.  And then later that afternoon/evening, the first of the 
Northwest Vintage weekend's scheduled events will be attended 
by the Berg Cruiser's.  From 5pm - on we'll be at the Burger Meat VW 
Cruise at the University Burgermaster Drive-in .

I understand that on Saturday morning the cruise participants can park 
in a special reserved area at the 17th Annual Northwest Vintage VW 
Show hosted by the Cascade Kombi's at Shoreline CC. The official 
hours are 9am - 3pm.  Saturday evening the Berg Cruise Social is a 
dinner at a VW Dealership TBA.  Sunday the Custom crowd has their 
day of VW drag racing, car show and swap meeting at Seattle 
International Raceway in Kent, WA.  Sunday evening there will be a 
Berg Cruise Social post Cruise dinner.

It should be a fun weekend of VW activities.  So come out and join up 
with us as we cruise to Seattle for the Vintage weekend!
