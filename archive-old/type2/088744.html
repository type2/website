&gt; &gt;I just had my engine rebuilt by Bob Donalds (Boston Engine) He also said

respond the

with
&gt; &gt;the Berg folks on engine heat.

&gt; Yes, I agree that measuring the oil is the way to go, (sense the heat
&gt; transfer fluid before the heat gets transferred) &gt;

&gt; Please jump in with personal experiences or knowledge.

While I have only had my guages installed for a few weeks, I have to
disagree (quietly) on this one. My cylinder head temp guage reacts to
driving changes MUCH more quickly than the oil temp guage; almost instantly,
in fact. For one thing, when I start her up in the morning, the head temp is
reading ~200 degrees before the oil temp even registers. Also, if I'm
driving 55/60 mph and then slow to 45, the head temp reading goes down in
less than a minute while the oil temp takes much longer.

BTW, this is in a 74 Riviera Day Camper, 1800 w/ Weber progressive, Kendall
20/50, ambient at 90+ with high humidity for the past two weeks.
