I've tried high temp paint, but it never seemed to be durable at all.
The only surfaces that need high-temp paint are surfaces that get above
300F, which limits it to the heads (which don't need paint), heat
exchangers, and exhaust.

The tin doesn't get anywhere near these temps, so ordinary rattle-can
paint is fine.  I use Krylon or Rustoleum (whichever is cheaper at the
time) in gloss black and it lasts for years.

Remember that the factory paint job was not exactly the ultimate finish.
the paint was there to prevent corrosion, nothing more.
