&gt;&gt; I put my 81 in the shop last week to check my brakes and was told on
&gt;&gt;Sat. that
&gt;&gt; I needed new rotors and best price was $129 ea. Told them to hold on while I
&gt;&gt; checked Bus Depot's page and found the rotors at $49ea. Got Ron on the phone
&gt;&gt; at noon Monday and damned if the things weren't delivered the next day!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ron's a bitch to get on the phone at times but the prices are
&gt;&gt;outstanding and
&gt;&gt; this is my second experience with excellent hurry up service. Do some
&gt;&gt;business
&gt;&gt; with him.

&gt;Am I the only person who hasn't had such a great expierience with them?
&gt;
&gt;first they sent me the wrong seal, and took months to finally send me
&gt;the right thing (it was just an engine seal), and now I've been waiting
&gt;3 weeks for my muffler.... and the price was the same as mid-america
&gt;designs....
&gt;
&gt;I seem to remember getting a mail from the list with something like &quot;hey
&gt;Ron, where's my exhaust&quot; or something at the bottom... I thought it was
&gt;funny before (I had only been waiting a week)
&gt;
&gt;I'm figuring this is one of those things that gets drop shipped from
&gt;RMMW- does it always take this long?

Your not the only one, though the vast majority of posts seem to be positive.

I ordered a 10mm head stud kit from them.  It was dropped shipped from
RMMW.  When after a week it didn't arrive I called BD and they said they
meant to call and let me know it had been delayed.  When it did arrive, the
washers weren't there.  I called again and they said they meant to call me
to let me know they were on back order.  Then those arrived.  6 months
later when I finally got around to installing them, I find out RMMW
mislabeled eight 10x188's as 10x240, making my set only half complete.  BD
said to send them back and they would refund me, which is cool.  I got the
impression that the late date was not a problem, but they weren't exactly
willing to replace, only to refund.  They told me that if I wanted to order
the correct studs that I would have to go direct, not through them.

I get the impression that they are a bit overworked at the Bus Depot.  I
will however continue to order from them.
