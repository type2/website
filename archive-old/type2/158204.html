Subject: '76 upper bunk question

I just acquired a 76 Westy and it is missing the cushions for the upper
bunk along with the board that folds down (although I have the hinges).

Could someone give me the measurements of the cushions and the board?
Pictures would also be great.


Thanks for everyones help. Most of my questions have been answered via the
archives.

Cheers,

Eric
