&lt;&lt; Crash &quot;padding&quot; would have to be a term used VERY loosely. I have 3 dashes
sitting in storage. None are in perfect condition but one isn't too bad.
All 3, after 30 years, are almost as hard as the metal they cover. They
would provide almost no shock absorption at this point and I don't believe
there is a &quot;new&quot; replacement available.

If the padding works or not &quot;might&quot; not be the issue to an insurance rep...
Your seat belts may be brittle as cardboard, but If you take them out...
And, no, I don't think the dashboard cover will really be a problem, but it
might. And should be a consideration...California inspections come to mind
here, where you could have a miracle engine that passes smog at the tail
pipe, but fails the visual for missing equipment... ;-(
On a sad note, a friend of mine recieved a notice from his insurance co.
that they were no longer covering his vehicle...His crime? He let his pick
up truck cross the 15 year old mark...
