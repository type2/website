Subject: Anyone want to buy a three door? (fwd)

All,

My neighbor has a nice three door pickup in his shed that
he said he'd like to sell. The gates are rusty, but that
seems like about all. It has no engine at the moment.
Oh yeah, I think it's a '63. It is in WA state near Portland
OR. It is very important to him that it goes to a good home.
E-mail me for details.
