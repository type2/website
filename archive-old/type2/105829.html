&gt;will have to buy a new mechanical pump for the type IV (which Bus Depot has

It's a bargain. Last time VW had them (over 10 years ago??) they were $132.

&gt;  or go to the electric fuel pump setup for about the
&gt;same price.  Anyone still use mechanical?  I would
&gt;love to hear some reasons for/against.

I've seen many of the electrical types give up the ghost in 2 months to 5 
years. They are noisy. They are not stock. On the other hand, the stock 
mechanical will last you at least the life of the engine, if not two engine 
lives. You can get replacement diaphrams from the Porsche 
suppliers/dealers. The ones for the late 356 and early 912 pumps will work, 
like 64 to 69 era.
