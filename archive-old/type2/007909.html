Subject: brake pressure regulator
Date: Mon, 30 Nov 1998 07:23:02 -0800

Greetings, Bus Folks,

My 74 Bus developed some erratic braking, sometimes pulling to the right
and sometimes locking up one of the right wheels (RF, I think). I knew the
rear adjusters were frozen up (had attempted to adjust them recently) so I
decided to do a brake job, starting at the rear. I found the RH brake
covered with brake fluid, and the adjusting screws were beyond saving, and
the LH had brake fluid under the cups, so I replaced the shoes, wheel
cylinders, and RH adjusters (lubing both sets of adjusters with white
grease), adjusted and bled the rear.

Now for my problem. After bleeding the rear until I got no air from the
bleeders, I still have way too much pedal travel, and the brakes will pump
up. OK, gotta be air in the lines, so we bleed 'em again. No bubbles in the
bottle, no improvement. Decided to bleed the front, no bubbles, no
improvement. So I start thinking, disc brake cars have an equalizer
(sometimes called proportioning) valve that might have to be centered (some
have springs and are self-centering). I found the brake pressure regulator,
but lack of time and an abundance of frustration caused me to call it a
day. After getting clean, dry and warm, I found the Bentley manual has a
procedure to check pressures, and says the BPR can't be repaired. Does
anyone know, is the BPR self-centering (springs on both sides of the
valve)? 

I searched the archives and found no reference to the brake pressure
regulator. I did find a post with similar symptoms to what I started with
(pulling, locking up). Jon Kirshbaum, are you out there?

Any help / advice / experience is greatly appreciated.
