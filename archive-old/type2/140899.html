Subject: Re: [T2] My 77 is a leaker.

From Mark Hineline:

Karl, what were the original screws?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

VW part number N 011 710 8    cheesehead 6 x 10 screw

ISPWest was selling them by the bag full [and straight slot type 1 screws] on that auction site.....  But I
cannot find any items there now. Like they gave up selling there?!?
I went to their website,  http://www.vwispwest_dot_com/3.html
but I see no listing of the screws. I don't see half the stuff they sold on that auction site.....  And I did
not see them at the last OCTO show either.

But I did find another seller [maybe ISPWest under a new name?]
selling type 1 screws, a bag of 100, item 4558810174  as
aircooledforeigncom

This ad, item 4584222813, incorrectly calls the straight slot screw a cheesehead screw. They are selling the
fillister head screw for the type 1 engine.
