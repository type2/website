 All the previous answers are correct.

 The only point I wanted to add (for electrical newbies) is that voltage measurements are taken ACROSS some form of resistance in an electrical circuit (e.g., checking the voltage across your tail light bulb). The meter's internal resistance is what you are reading across if reading directly off the battery). Current measurements (e.g., milliamps) are taken in SERIES with the electrical circuit (e.g., remove the positive battery cable, insert milliameter so that the positive lead connects with the positive battery post, and the negative lead connects with the (now) disconnected battery cable).  You may damage your meter if you connect it up incorrectly for either type of measurement.
