Subject: Monday Miscellaneous

I feel as though I have accomplished something.  My first valve adjustment.
My question however, how do I know I did it well enough.  After horsing
around with the feeler gauge at least 5 times per, I settled on what I felt
to be correct, but, hmmmmm, a brand new engine, I want to be careful.
Additionally, there were a few threads a while back on the pop top canvass.
I took mine off yesterday, with plans of getting a custom made job.  Anyone
have any things I should be aware of on install?
The whole job seems like one of those deals that come apart much easier than
going back in.
Thanx for reading, share if you have anything I should be aware of.
Respectfully,

FEBIII
