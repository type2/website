Hey Volks...Well, this past weekend me and Sprout(my 76 Westy) went to
Wilkesboro, NC for Merlefest. I live near Atlanta so the trip Started
on 85N. As I approched Greenville, SC traffic was just stopped. It
turned out that 3 Tractor Trailers had wrecked along with a couple
cars. After sitting in Traffic for almost 3 hours(not even travelling 1
mile) a girl asked me to move up so she could get by in the emergency
lane. I told her &quot;sure&quot;..I then asked if she knew someway around this
and she did so I followed her. I finally got back on 85 moving toward
Charlotte. I should have been in Wilkesboro by now but....Anyway, I get
to I77 North..about 30 miles onto I77..I'm cruising down the interstate
at about 60...it had been pouring down rain for the whole trip...all of
sudden..my bus dies! I pull over and try to start it up..nothing. I
don't know a lot about engines so I played with what I knew..mainly
seeing that all wires were connected. I finally gave up..this is about
1:30 AM on Thursday night. I was very thankful that I had gotten a cell
phone at this time. I called AAA..told them where I was, what I needed,
etc. She got my membership number and all but before we could say
goodbye..my phone went dead. I figured well..they know where I
am..she'll send someone. I waited, and waited and waited...nobody ever
came. Well, I was'nt about to get out and walk to an exit in the middle
of the night in pouring down rain so I close the curtains and went to
bed...I woke up every five minutes. The next morning I walked to the
next exit._dot_called AAA again..told them my story..they said Oh, we'll
have someone there in 45 minutes...1 hour passed...2 hours passed...
Finally about 30 minutes later they show up.
I've been sitting in the same spot for 23 hours now. Oh, a cop finally
pulls over..Wow! All this help at once. Anyway, he towed me to a
shop...turns out..it was some wire gone bad..cost me 25 bucks and I was
on my way to Merlefest. It was a good time except for the trip there.
Two buses stopped to see if they could help a 75 and a 78. If your one
of these people, thanks for stopping and send me an email.

moral of the story: AAA is slooooooooow!

Peace and Love,

Greg
