Subject: RE: [T2] WTB hoop end caps and center surport

Hey Mark,

Derek Gregg of DG Creations does hoops for all years and models.
661-946-1303
Lancaster, CA
+$300 (requires re-welding the hoops because of shipping constraints)

Tom Bueses does the canvases for bays all years and models.
bueses_at_earthlink_dot_net
Salt Lake City, UT
+$700

Derek and Tom did my DoubleCab hoops and canvas and their quality is better
than original (if you do the &quot;sunbrella&quot; option instead of the standard duck
cotton). However, the stabilization bumpers are NLA and I haven't seen them
for sale. For the wooden slats, you just go to Home Depot and make your own
out of oak if you are handy with a table saw. Cost was about $40.

My suggestion on purchasing; if you do any highway driving or commuting, you
might consider a cab-height set (which was standard in N. America). My DC's
top speed and mileage drops dramatically with the over-cab Tilt
(standard/optional in Europe) and as a result I find myself not using it. In
fact, I am going to see if anyone wants to trade me for a cab-height set or
I'm going to put the set up for sale.

Hope this helps,

Jon Stiles
