Subject: 23 window without sun roof??? 
Date: Thu, 8 Oct 1998 22:00:24 -0700



Volks,
Well I know that what I'm going to ask is probably best posted on the
vintage bus sight but I'm going to ask everyone here instead. Today when
driving down the road I spotted a 23 window for sale in a driveway. When I
stopped to check it out the first thing I noticed was that it didn't have a
sun roof. Did they come this way or has this bus been modified? The rest of
the bus is in almost perfect condition (looks completely original). Anyone
know the deal?
