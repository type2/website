&gt; I am running a Petronix in the stock DVAD on my '71 Westy.

&gt; I had a bit of a rough ride home all of a sudden yesterday and today 
&gt; I stuck every gauge I own on the beast.  The only one that gave a 
&gt; surprise reading was the dwell meter. Instead of reading 47 degrees, 
&gt; it read 70.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it legitimate to expect a conventional dwell meter to read dwell 
&gt; on a Petronix ignition system?

mine does, 

&gt; I see no way to adjust the dwell.

check the gap.  of course it could be bad
