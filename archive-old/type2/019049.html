Hi Volks;
   Just got off the phone with Nikki. She made it to El Paso, Tx last
night about 11:00 after pulling out of San Angelo about 3:00 pm. (She
said she might have set a new record on valve adjustments-3 1/2 hours)
and a flat repair also slowed things up.

   The bus is running OK, she's being very careful, stopping every
couple hours and checking for leaks and continuously doing the &quot;monitor
by ear&quot; deal all VW owners develop over time.

   She is planning to try to make to Phoenix today and on to LA
tomorrow. I made her promise to call me when she stops for the night.

   She did get pulled over by a THP patrolman because of the missing
headlight, but he saw the damage, said &quot;Ouch.&quot; and wrote her a warning
instead of a real ticket. Nikki's going to see if she collects warnings
from all the states she's got left on her trip home.

   Anyhow, she's still on the road, moving slowly and carefully toward
home. And if any of you along the route happen to have a spare
wheel/tire combo, she would like to talk.
