C.D. Hoyle sends:

&gt; So the question is, where do we go from here?  What caused this to happen
&gt; in the first place, and can these heads and pistons be repaired or must
&gt; they be replaced.  If two of the pistons are replaced, do you recommend
&gt; that the others be replaced as well?  Thanks for helping out some newbies.

It's worn out. This happens.

The head I don't know about; you should take it to a machinist and let him
decide. You can box it up and send it to AVP, a rebuilder of Type 4 engines,
and order a rebuilt head. If you get some money back, the head was
rebuildable. 

The cylinders should always be replaced when rebuilding a VW engine. They
come in a set of four, and all four should be used.
