Volks,

The web address for McMaster Carr is:

http://www.mcmaster_dot_com/

A few lifetimes ago, I remember the Civil Engineering Squadron I worked for 
in the Air Force use the McMaster Carr catalogs as sources for all sorts of 
parts and supplies.  As I recall, they were nearly 3&quot; thick, yellow cover.  
When tasked to find data, I usually got lost, just looking at all of the 
stuff that was possible.

For those that like to personalize their bus by modifing the interior, this 
should be a great source of inspiration.  I was just looking at some adhesive 
backed wool/rayon blend felt, that is 32&quot; wide, at a bit more than $8 bucks a 
foot... was thinking that it would make a great vibration dampener in doors 
and behind the front kick panels.  At 3/64&quot; thick, it might make a great 
liner for the fiberglass pop top.  I might also find replacement rubber 
spacer for the luggage rack on the '72.  Shucks, glad I don't work today, 
think I might be looking and dreaming thru this catalog.

No association, never was able to order from them in those days, but might 
now.  Thanks for the trip down memory lane.
