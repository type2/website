Subject: Questions re. 75 Weekender

Once again I defer to your volumes of knowledge...  As I have had the motor 
(1800 pancake) out of the bus over 5 times in the past couple of years 
(without driving in between) we found it easier to keep the transmission 
attached.  Now that we have finally resolved all of the oil leaks the motor 
went back in...  Now one of those 2 bloody bolts (literally, there are 
probably still pieces of the knuckles of 2 or 3 suckers besides myself up 
there!) that are located above the tranny will not go in.  If I have to take 
this motor out one more time I will probably burn the garage down with the 
steam from my ears; is there any way to resolve this without subjecting 
myself to such nightmares?

Secondly, I replaced all of the rear CV joints &amp; boots.  The old ones had 
these weird little batwing-shaped spacer/washer things that go between the 
outside of the boot and the bolts that hold the CV boot/joint in place.  One 
was missing when I removed everything, and the new CV joints/boots did not 
come with this hardware (or any, for that matter).  Rocky Mountain Motorworks 
doesn't seem to carry them, and I would rather buy one than have my husband 
try to make one at work.  Any suggestions?

And lastly, can a clutch cable stretch?

Thanks for smiling behind your hands,
