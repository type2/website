Sorry I totally forgot to tell you where the bus is, it is in Portland OR, 
but it does run good.
Thanks again.

I am needing to sell my '78 Riviera.  This is a beautiful bus, I purchased
it from a man that had purchased it from the original just a few months
earlier.  The van is in great shape.  Has all seats, IT IS NOT A CAMPER, it
is a passenger bus with a pop top.  I just put a new head on it and have all
receipts for it.  I also at the same time as the head had the FI worked on.
The bus runs great and with very little work could be close to perfect.  I
am asking $2800.OBO Please e-mail me if you would like some pictures. And
please do not be afraid to make offers I am really needing to sell, wish I
did not have to but I do.
Thanks,

Larry Morris
'78 &quot;Riviera&quot;
Its gotta be a POP TOP!
