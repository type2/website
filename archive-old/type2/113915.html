No.

&gt;When
&gt;I give it gas something is spraying oil on the header on the right side.  I
&gt;can see it cooking off the header.  Just seem to be very slight at idle but
&gt;when I rev it up it hits the exhaust and smokes off.  I can't seem to tell
&gt;where it's coming from.

Check the thermostat pulley bolt hole.  It goes right into the case and if you leave the bolt out for whatever reason it will spray a very fine oil mist onto the right heat exchanger and muffler.
