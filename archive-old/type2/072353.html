Subject: RE: [T2] make your own archives

&gt;The big problem with that is that Outlook will only put 32767
&gt;items in a folder. Anybody figure out a way to turn the items
&gt;in the folder into regular files? You could put the files in
&gt;a directory and use grep to find what you want.

I often save Type 2 messages that interest me or that feel will come 
in handy in the future. I just save them as a text file to a VW Tips 
folder then delete them from my inbox or read mail box. I am using 
Eudora instead of Outlook, but I am sure most all email programs have 
the message save as .txt feature.

A searchable data base would be better for me, but for the time being 
I give the saved messages a descriptive file name.
