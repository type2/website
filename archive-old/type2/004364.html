Subject: [T2] Holley Carb ?

&gt;Recently bought a '79 bus which was converted to a crab.

Crabs walk sideways, lobsters walk straight ahead.

&gt; Was running lean
&gt;(lots of popping and backfireinn while coasting).  I found a leak where one
&gt;of the intake pipes meets the carb mount (someone didn't connect the hose
&gt;right).  Now I can't get it to run.  I think the carb was tuned rich to
&gt;compensate for the leak.  Now I think it floods.

Check/ verify float level.

&gt;The carb says &quot;Holley&quot; on it.

&quot; Holley Would &quot; ?

&gt;What I really want to know is: How do I set the mixture screw to just get
&gt;the thing running so I can fine tune it?  I assumed that clockwise turn of
&gt;the mixture screw makes it leaner and counter-clockwise makes it richer.

Yes.

&gt; I just want to get this thing running so I can use it while I restore my '76 (with  FI).
&gt; I just don't want to spend much :&gt;)

Get a rebuild kit. And new rubber manifold couplers.check fuel pump pressure.
and new fuel hoses.( and new hose clamps :)
