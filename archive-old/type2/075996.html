No, one out of three type4's I find in the yards have regular heater boxes. No,
they were 'converted'. The timer switch in the dash was not and never was there.
I found the owners manual in one and the gas heater was listed as an option.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The drawbacks are that they don't put out nearly the heat that the bus
&gt; &gt; &gt; exchangers do,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason for this: They are only pre-heaters for the BA 4 gas heater. The
411
&gt; &gt; used a bus-style blower motor up top in the air intake. This blew air thru
the
&gt; &gt; mini boxes into the BA 4 mounted above the transaxle.
&gt; &gt; The BA 4 gas heater was an option. On 411's and 412's without it, they ran
full
&gt;
&gt; ??? huh, I bought my wife a 412 from the dealer way back when and there
&gt; was no mention of it as being an option, it was just there....at least in
&gt; the USA I have yet to see a 411/412 without one
&gt;
&gt; the Chilton manual which is the only one that mentions it says &quot;the Type
&gt; 4, which also comes standard with an auxilliary gas heating system&quot;  later
&gt; it says &quot;the gas heater runs on gasoline from the fuel tank and is
&gt; avaliable as an option on type 2 and type 3 models  (section 6-12)
&gt;
&gt; maybe you are thinking about the type 3??
&gt; or maybe non USA models?
&gt; or maybe the Chilton is wrong, wouldn't be the first time
