&gt;Subject: Starting problem - FI?

&gt;So I guess my questions are:
&gt;Could the cold start valve be working only when I am messing with it?  I 
&gt;thought that if there was a bad connection, that when I pushed it I might 
&gt;temporarily fix that connection.  Is there anyway to tell if it is 
&gt;working without touching it?  Does that require a fuel pressure gauge?

This is a common sign that the whose system is bad. Reolace it with a carb, 
and send me the wiring harness;-)

More seriously:
 Try feeling it, or listening to it witha tube, or screwdriver while someone
starts the bus. You should be able to feel, or hear it click, and then click
again after 2-11 seconds depending on engine temperature?

Any one know what number corks fit in all the holes in the air plumbing when
you are trying to start an FI without all the parts? ;-z0
