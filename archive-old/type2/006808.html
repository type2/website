&gt; Has anyone had any luck
&gt;  out of a spray can or know of something I can do myself?
A few years back I bead blasted an extractor system and painted it with a can 
of high-temp black spray paint.  It started rusting in the first few weeks of 
operation.
Recently I've done the same thing with a tube manifold on my MG and an 
extractor/single muffler system on my '71 Westy.  But, instead of using the 
spray on cr*p I used brush on high temp that I purchased from Eastwood.  The 
header has been on my MG for about a year and it's not rusty.  There were a 
few rust spots on the extractor system after a few weeks.  I lightly sanded 
those spots and recoated them.  That was about two months ago and the finish 
is holding up fine.
