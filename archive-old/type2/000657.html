A co-worker saw this 74 Bus and talked to the owner.  It is in Lebanon, NH.
140K miles + or -.  From Colorado, good condition.  He will fix brake light
and rear wheel cylinder.  I haven't seen it but my friend says it looks
clean, owner and wife seem nice and may haggle.  Price $2000.  Bruce
Vincent, 603-448-2715, 7a-10p.  If anyone is very interested, I'll take a
look for you.  You know what I know.
