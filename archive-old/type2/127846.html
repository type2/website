Subject: Oil leak of the damned

QUOTE:

The things I've tried so far:

- sealing underneath the big washer on the end of
the fan hub with 
silicone
- replacing the rubber o-ring underneath the fan
hub, that presses 
between
the hub and crankshaft
- putting silicone on that o-ring
- replacing the entire fan hub with a different
(used) one
- covering the entire end of the crankshaft, the
seal, the washer, 
and the
mating surface between the fan and the hub with
silicone

RESPONSE:
Put down the silicone!!!  Back away slowly. 
Don't move your hands....

You seem to have the oil leak isolated... and you
seem to know that silicone will never help and
probably hurts.  You know what you have to do,
right?
