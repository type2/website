Subject: Fuel Gauge/Part Numbers

Two part  conundrum.

1.  I'm looking for a working fuel gauge and bi-metallic vibrator for 
my '79 Westy.  Does anyone have these parts laying around to sell?

2.   It has occurred to me to find the part number and see if VW might 
still have a new one laying around somewhere.  However, I can't figure 
out how to identify the part numbers for these items.  I've checked 
Ratwell's page and found the correct fiche and fiche reference numbers, 
however I don't know how to convert the fiche reference number to a 
part number?
