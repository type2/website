Subject: Re: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

Nobody stocks new 50/50 or &quot;safare&quot; windows, commonly refered to as jalousie
windows. They must be found at swap meets, classifieds or the junk yards,
possibly bustedbus_dot_com. The jalousie window is much more common and you can
generally reuse the grey seal from ones in the junkyard, etc. Keep in mind
the jalousie windows were held in by a lot of tiny little screws, so you
will have to drill holes in your transporter. Not too hard to do and the
jalousies should have screens with them. The 50/50 sliding windows were only
found on the late transporters (78&amp;79??). They let in a lot of air when
driving (I swapped my jalousies for these) but you will have to make your
own screens for camping. New seals can be had at GoWesty or similar for
about $20 each.

Two notes: The Vanagon windows will NOT fit. Also the Riviera campers had
50/50 windows with screens, but unless someone knows otherwise, the flange
on these windows is thicker and won't work with the new seals commonly
found.

Good luck,
