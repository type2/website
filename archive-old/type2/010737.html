well its been about a week since i posted the question to the readers about
the pros and cons and specifics involved in my decision to put a beetle motor
into my 72 van.................and the verdict is ..............NOT.  i
thought about it long and hard, weighed the cost, time to fab some parts,
power, etc. etc. and i decided to keep it original.  all my other vehicles are
stock, (minus one or two small mods ) and the numbers match on this van, so id
be foolish not to.  and the truth is i wont need much to rebuild this 1700
anyways.  i am going to try to use used ( but still within factory tolerances
) parts when available.    so ... i will be posting a list next week or two to
try and round up some odds and ends i cant find locally.

heres the preliminary verdict or needed parts:
   the motor was running but pouring smoke when i got it.  it would zip down
the interstate but man the smoke was thick.  i bought it anyways the price was
unbeatable....and i thought heck, the motor is at least running ( albiet
bad...).  i can rebuild.  upon opening her up i found everything to be within
useable tolerances..( altho on the low end of the wear cycle )...i would like
to find a set of 1700 p/c/wrist pins and 1700 heads. (the engine had one bad
piston, and a broken ring on #3..all other pistons ok, head on that side in
fair shape.)

i have TO TRADE OR SELL a complete set of a westy interior in decent shape
from a 70-71 van.  hardware, seats, windows, table, sink, step stool, bed (3/4
) closet. etc
or possibly i will just purchase the things i need if anyone has some of the
1700 stuff i need.
