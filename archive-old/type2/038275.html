Subject: Something Positive about GEX

I'm not a big fan of any mass rebuilder of engines as I prefer to do my own. 
But I have to say that I worked on a 79 beetle this week with 3500 miles on 
a GEX engine. It was just driven here from Arizona and was running horribly.
After a couple of hours of fiddling with it I Managed to get it running most 
respectably. It was TOTALLY dry and all of it's problems were due to a bad 
installation and an installer that compensated for a basic problem[out of 
calibration decel valve causing a huge vacuum leak] by turning screws and 
changing the timing etc.
With the overly lean mixture, Too tight valve clearances,and the timing the 
way it was this engine was a good cantidate for an explosion. Doubtless it 
would have been blamed on GEX.
