Subject: Re: [T2] Bus paint jobs

The last Beetle I had painted, I took it to a shop basically a shell with 
wheels and a tranny. I did the body work myself and some primer. But I 
talked to the shop about painting it before they new what I had already 
done. I wanted the deluxe package they had. Primer, sand, paint, sand, 
paint, sand, clear. I got a price of like $675. I asked why so much. Reply &quot; 
All the taping and masking on a Punchbug is worth about $300&quot;. &quot;Good,&quot; I 
said then it should only cost me $375 because there is no taping and masking 
needed.&quot; &quot;So I'll take it.&quot; This was one of those Maco type of places by the 
name of Peaches Auto and Collision Center. After some hagling over the cost 
of covering the wheels for $50 and that being the extra price, I complained 
that they did not have to cover them.  It cost me about $425. I agreed to 
pay the extra $50 if he let me come in and see between steps. &quot;You can't do 
that it will take you all day and you will miss work.&quot; &quot;I will just take the 
day off.&quot; I told him. The funny thing is I only went in for a couple of the 
steps. It was cool to see. Better yet, when I got it back with the 
&quot;warranty&quot;  I ended up taking it back because of some inbedded sand in the 
paint in several spots. I found it once went back and they respayed the 
entire thing after fixing the sandy parts. I took it home again and I found 
more. It went back. What was going to be a good cheap job turned out to be a 
great cheap job.

If you go to the Cheapo Chain Shops know what you are getting. In my case I 
couldn't drive the car around and I was not going to tow it around for 
quotes. I think it worked out better that way, of course I didn't want any 
bodywork, just paint.

Good Luck,
