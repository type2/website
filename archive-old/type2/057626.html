Subject: heater box levers

(I posted a big, long &quot;Gottabus&quot; post &amp; intro over the weekend, around the
time the server problems started.  Honestly don't think it made it.  Also,
I don't know if I used anything to get my message filtered out... I've seen
people write things like &quot;B*g&quot; here, and suspect that this is may be why.
I'd very much like a list of taboo phrases if this is the case!)

--------------

	So!  I'm awaiting delivery of a '70 seven-passenger bus, which
you'd all know about, but my big, long, how-do-you-do post didn't seem to
make it. :(

	The bus apparently has B*g heat exhangers installed, but they're
not hooked up.  The PO indicated that the levers and/or cable hook-up were
different.  I searched the Busted Bus archives and, indeed, found a
description of this; somebody from San Diego said that &quot;I can get the kits
at half a dozen local FLAPS.&quot;  I couldn't dig up much more detail than this.

	When I look in the glossy catalogs, I find the same part number
listed for heater boxes for both types of vehicle and the same part number
listed for lever kits for both types of vehicle.  Is this the correct lever
kit for me?  Are they the same parts, just installed differently?  Or is it
like a carb rebuild kit, with several extra parts not used in all
applications?

Cheers,
-Greg
