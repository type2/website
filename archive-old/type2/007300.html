Re a temp. fix while searching for new u-tubes:
 I've gone 8k on this fix-  (on a cross-country trip when flange
connections to heater box rotted).....get the area really clean of any oil
and get a TUB (about 4-5&quot; high) of furnace cement from your hardware store.
 This is a white material with sodium silicate that globs on nicely with
your hands.   I found some fiberglass ribbon (a local electrician threw it
out) which was about 1.5&quot; wide and 1/8&quot; thick and first glopped the cement
around the flange, and also all over the ribbon.  Wrap the flange/bad area
with the ribbon, making it tight and overlapping (in a criss-cross pattern
if at the flange), finally tying it in place.  Glop on some more  so it's
smooth.  You can wrap wire over that to help keep it together; what you
want to end up with is a composite that's held by the fibers within it, for
sodium silicate is very brittle and will crack eventually.  To cure this
I've tried (1) idling it gently or *(2) letting it air dry before idling.
The latter is better; cracks more readily if car is driven too soon, and
driving before curing can blow a gas stream thru the weakest area.
     I've driven thousands of miles before having to renew this- even
cracked it does a good job of muffling.  Trick is to keep it immobilized
around the outside even if cracked against the pipe.  It's easy to get off,
just chip with a screw driver, and cut the ribbon with a razor knife.   If
you can't find the ribbon, fiberglass autorepair cloth is a distant second;
this will blow out sooner; wrap it well with wire.
