Subject: Re: [T2] I'll throw in my dizzy question too - Hi Eric

Bosch #0 231 170 093

Single vacuum line from throttle body/intake air dist.

I have this in my 79 2L FI, but my timing hunts a bit,
so when I asked for a price down at the import FLAPS,
it was $430.  I would expect that the best course of
action (which is my own personal intent) is to find
one at a junk yard and rebuild it, then pull out the
old one and rebuild it for a spare.

My two cents.
