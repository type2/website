Subject: [T2] Oil: Iis my dad full of it??


&gt; Listees....
&gt;
&gt; The saga continues. Bought an 82 Westy in texas and it's under the care of
&gt; my father. Scary. The previous owner has always used P*nnzoil in it...and
of
&gt; course i've always used Castrol in my VWs. My father is going to have the
&gt; oil changed before the trip....yes scary...and he says that we have to
stick
&gt; with P*nnzoil as switching to another brand will burn the engine up.
&gt;
&gt; Is this just like a rumor that swiching brands is bad or is there some
truth
&gt; to it?? Can anyone explain why it wouldn't hurt the engine to switch to
&gt; Castrol?
