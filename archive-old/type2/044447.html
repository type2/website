POR-15 = 1; Wood = 0

I had coated my gas flap and its hinge with POR-15 White-Kote, then
forgot about then for a few weeks. I had left the hinge sitting on its
ends on a wooden sawhorse. I retrieved it last night, and, after a brief
but intense tug-o-war, the wood gave before the rust-proof coating did
and now I have two little bits of wood on each end of my hinge.

Wow. I'm a believer. POR-15's pretty awesome. Try it.
