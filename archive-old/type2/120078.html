&gt; Will an early 3 rib IRS transmission (I think its a 71) fit in a 1977 bus?
&gt; My overhauled tranny is acting up :(

The short answer is &quot;NO!&quot;

The longer answer is both yes and no.  A 1971 transmission can be used in
a 1977 bus if you want to obtain the European tin and engine support bar
and install a type 1 engine.  It can also be used if you want to
transplant the bell housing, input shaft and starter from your 1977
transmission (1976-1979 will work).  The 1971 transmission is NOT a direct
drop-in replacement for the 1977 transmission.  In North America
Volkswagen supplied only type4 motors after 1971 and these motors used
transmissions with very different mounts, flywheels, starters, and gear
ratios from the transmissions used with 1968-1971 type 1 engines.

If you have the time and money you can adapt the mounts for a 1971
transmission to work in your bus but the gear ratios will still be very
unsatisfactory.  You would be far better advised to obtain a good used or
rebuilt 1976-1979 transmission or at least a 1972-1975 transmission.

                              OOK
