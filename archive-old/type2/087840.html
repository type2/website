Subject: new camper

Whoohoo!!!  We are the proud owners of a 77 Sage Green Riviera.  It is very
nice.  I can't wait to get some pictures &amp; show you all.  I want to thank
all for the assistance &amp; encouragement.  It has a funny icebox with a fan in
the front.  It has the two burner stove that stores under the back seat.  No
furnace but a working gas heater.  Interior &amp; poptop canvas are in real good
shape.  I will probably have some questions in a few days.  I will also get
some pictures &amp; post them.

Pat
77 Riviera
