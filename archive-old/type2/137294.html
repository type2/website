Subject: Am going south....again....

Around the 16 of fev. i should be north of FL or in GA, am open to any 
suggestions... a few beers would be nice around a camp fire. (i will 
bring some Canadian beers)

I only know that i want to spend a few quite night at Fort De soto in 
FL, after or before that, pfffffffffffffff... anything goes for me. GA, 
AL, SC!!! that is all good for me. Just give me some sunshine.. and dome 
heat.

Cheers, Ben
