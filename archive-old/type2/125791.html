&quot;Hi Everybody,
    I'm sure you've all heard a vehicle that had a squeal do to worn
or slipping belts.  Right?  Well, I had that same squeal with our 71
bus with a 1600DP engine,  so I ordered up a new belt plus a spare.
Installed the new belt....&quot;

Hey Paul, 
           You're talking about the 'learning curve' every diagnostician must 
face.  More experience generally means quicker convergence on correct results.  
You can always think about acquiring tools to help you, perhaps a stethoscope, 
maybe a point-and-read digital thermometer..... you can have a ball on the 
Horrible Freight website, AMHIK.  If we looked a few years into the future, 
perhaps you could have captured the squeal with a digital microphone, then 
attached it to your post, so the type2 folks could listen.  What you describe 
as a squeal would seem to me more of a whistle.  Glad you fixed the problem!
