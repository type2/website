Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning case parting line

I think Harry may have recommended this method in &quot;Secrets&quot;. I use a piece 
of green Scotchbrite pad although I don't see a problem with steel wool if 
you are going to wash the case before assembly. Once the case parting 
surfaces are clean use Curil T for reassembly. Curil T seals well and is 
easily removed. Aviation Permatex also seals well but is very difficult to 
remove even with a scraper.

&gt; If the answer to this question is yes, a lot of knowledgeable people are 
&gt; going to groan:
&gt;
&gt; Will a little cleaning with very fine (000) steel wool damage the case 
&gt; parting surfaces?
