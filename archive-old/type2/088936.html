&gt; Ed,

&gt; I thought that was you with the Megasquirt, but wasn't sure.
&gt;
&gt; I too am interested in your mileage.

Don't have numbers yet. I don't see why it would be significantly different
than with a stock FI that is running well.

&gt;
&gt; I bought a tps that should work well and will only use the
&gt; tps and map sensor on mine to start with.  Maybe the o2 sensor later.
&gt;

I don't see how you can run without the O2 sensor - you need to have it in
order to tune your VE table. Well, yes, you can RUN without an O2 sensor,
but you need one to tune the MS to your engine.

&gt; Ed(and others), I want MS for all of the reasons already discussed, but I
&gt; intend to get some side benefits as well.  A display that will fit in my
&gt; dash that will tell me rpm's and cylinder head temp based on the sensor
&gt; that is already there...and the functions that currently exsist in the
&gt; Megasquirt ECU.  It could also tell me intake air temp as well.  In other
&gt; words, anything that the ECU knows about could be displayed on a small lcd
&gt; display.

Bruce/Al are working on an LCD dash display (MegaDash!).

&gt;
&gt; Think about it....rpm and the other stuff essentially for free with a
&gt; little hacking on the code.....for instance....I want my air conditioning
&gt; to work again on the bus....about  code that will turn off the
&gt; compressor when the ecu senses that you are going wide open
&gt; throttle....the ecu will turn off the a/c compressor just like on your
&gt; late model u.s. cars....
&gt;

Yes! You could reprogram to use one of the LED's as an output to drive a
relay for kicking in/out your compressor!

&gt;
&gt; I intend to make Meagasquirt work with my crappy engine first and then
&gt; rebuild the engine to utilize it properly.
&gt;
&gt; Tell us about power and response with Megasquirt???...better? worse?

I couldn't tell any significant difference in response or power. The *feel*
of more/less power is especially prone to interpretation - so real numbers
from some form of measurement are the only thing that mean much to me.

&gt;
&gt; Do you really think that the afm chokes off the intake that much?

The AFM appears to have the smallest cross section of anything in the entire
intake path, so high rev HP may be improved a bit. I certainly don't know if
this would be significant or not.

Another thing to note regarding MegaSquirt is that since it is so very
configurable, one could easily substitute different injectors running at
different fuel pressure etc. To setup a new FI system you really don't need
to limit yourself to having to include any stock FI components in your
system.
