Subject: Re: FW: Loose Axle nut. Other weird noises

 Hi,
        I got several replies (thanks everyone), mostly suggesting that the loose nut probably accounts for both noises: one from the looseness itself and the other most likely a wheel bearing in the early stages of failure.
 I bit the bullet yesterday and sprung for a 46mm socket and 3/4&quot; drive breaker bar (think I might keep that handy in case I break down late at night...:-). After tightening up the nut things are better but I still have the humming that seems to be indicative of an iffy bearing so I guess I'll have to strip it down and investigate futher. As a couple of people pointed out, this would be a good idea, anyway.

 Hopefully when I get in there all I'll need is new bearings. The van is pretty low mileage (80K) and I suspect that the PO's have skimped  on chassis maintenance.

 I'll start collecting the parts as I hope to be able to do this in one pass- I want to try to avoid having the van off the road while I wait for parts to arrive if I can.

Thanks for your help- if anyone has any further thoughts, tips or suggestions, please send them in!

Cheers,
              W.
