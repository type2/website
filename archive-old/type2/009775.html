Subject: Headlight Switch Confusion
Message-Id: &lt;199906100741.DAA26797_at_ziplink_dot_net&gt;

Hello, Volks.  Got a question about the terminals on the headlight switch in
Lazarus, my '68.  

I'm afraid this is a question that would be answerable via my Bentley
diagrams... if one of Lazarus' PO's hadn't rewired things using all the
same-color wire in some places, and random colors in others.  :|  So I have no
references whatsoever to go by when it comes to which-wire-does-what.  I'm sorry
to take up bandwidth; I really wouldn't if I could avoid it.  

I've been trying to puzzle it out anyhow via the wiring diagram (BTW, when you
all trace the wierd little lines in the diagrams, do *you* feel like Pee Wee
Herman singing &quot;Connect The Dots, La la la la la!&quot; or is this something I should
take up with my therapist?), but the diagram doesn't show the terminals in their
physical locations on the switch.  Also, there are no legible labels on the
switch.  :/  

The switch looks approximately like so:

                _____________
                |           |
                |  1     5  |
                |           |
                | 2     6 7 |
                |           |
                |  3        |
                |           |
                |  4        |
                |           |
                |           |
                _____________
                     | |
                    -----
                   /     \
                   -------


The numbers are the male push-on connectors.  Connectors &quot;2&quot; and &quot;7&quot; (the
numbers are mine, and arbitrary) are unused.  

Does anyone know what connector goes where?  

I have a good reason for asking.  &lt;:)  

Last year, I installed VDO oil temp and pressure gauges along with my rebuild,
and wired the lights to my switch (terminal number 3 above), choosing contacts
by trial and error; I *thought* I'd gotten it right, but now that I'm attempting
to drive Lazarus (a year later (don't ask)), I'm running into lighting problems,
and I suspect I may have shorted something with the VDO lights.  (Symptoms are
described below, just in case someone with a magic wand wants to wave it and
illuminate the problem for me &lt;:))  

I've had it up to my eyeballs with trial and error and uncertainty; if someone
knows which terminal goes where, I would be prostrate with gratitude.  I'd be
even *more* prostrate with gratitude if  someone knows and they tell me.  :)  

I'm sorry, maybe I should try trial and error again, but it's now 3:30AM, I
don't have any other transportation, and my turn signals don't work, making it
difficult and dangerous to drive on the
twisty-turny-with-unpredictable-turnoffs-and-lane-changes, highly traveled
Connecticut roads between me and my job.  Not to mention that I'd like to make
it to my date tomorrow night.  8|  

And I'm being absolutely certain, in the future, to use proper colors for my
wiring jobs.  What a novel concept.  :P  


Symptoms:

*  Intermittent failure of turn-signal indicators.  (Actually, not quite
intermittent; they *were* working two days ago, they weren't yesterday, and
still aren't today --let's just say they don't work.)

*  No turn signal when using the signal-lever, no indicators, no clicking.

*  Emergency flasher works, but only flashes left-front and right-rear. 
(Right-front and left-rear bulbs glow without flashing when headlights are on
and emergency flasher on.)  

*  The bulbs aren't burnt out.  

*  The flasher relay seems to work; two of the bulbs are flashing, after all.  

*  Fuses seem okay.  

*  Exorcism got rid of two poltergeists and an imp, but I suspect there's still
a minor demon or two hiding in the heater ducts.  And you wouldn't *believe*
what the imp did in my nice, clean glove compartment.  

Probably a short or two; I'll have to dig them out, that's okay.  But first...
which terminal is which?!  What wire goes where?  What are these things *doing*?  

Help?
