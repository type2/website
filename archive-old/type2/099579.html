Don't waste the time.  Bite the bullet, and drop the engine.  At a minimum,
you'll need to torque ALL nuts on both heads--gradually, back and forth from
head to head--as per the instructions in the Bentley Manual.  Pulling heads
and cylinders may unearth additional problems, that it would be better to
discover in your workshop, than on the road the hard way.

&gt;Still it is going to be difficult for me to consider a long trip without 
&gt;first pulling
&gt;the engine and making sure everything is as it should be.

I wouldn't drive around the block with that engine.
