Subject: curtains
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

To install curtains in a bus I would advise you to go to
the local hardware store and buy some flat aluminum or soft
steel bar stock. thin enough to bend say around 1/8&quot; thick
and around 3/4&quot; on the flat side... then you measure where
those little round white knob things are located and that
will be the measurements for the holes you drill in the bar
stock. Looking at the bar stock from the side it will look
something like this..
   ______________________     ______________________
__/                      \___/                      \___

where the short spots are where the holes for the fastners
go and the raised, longer lengths, are where the curtains
are hanging from.. to make the curtains you sew a wide
seam. Wide enough for the bar stock to slide in.
You need to bend the stock as shown to get the standoff
required for the curtains to slide open an shut.
