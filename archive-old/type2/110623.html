Subject: air cleaner

On a 1700 oil bath air cleaner, there are 2 hoses on the passenger side that come hook up to the part of the air cleaner that fits over the carb...I hate to say this, but I marked one and not the other and now I can't for the life of me tell where this goes.  It is the outter most hose. I know where the inner one goes, but after feeling, looking and the million obligatory head bumps I just can't locate it...please,  please help.
