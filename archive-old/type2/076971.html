Subject: Re: [T2] New FuFu or Snake Oil

Chris Mills says of No-Smoke Motor Oil Additives:

&gt; The stuff is as thick as honey and I figure it can't do good things that
&gt; relies on the oil to be thin enough to get into the tighter parts of the
&gt; engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a band-aid for a real problem. More or less a waste of money too.

It's The Unscrupulous Used Car Dealer's Best Friend, Chris. Dump a bottle or
two into the worst smoker and she looks like she's got a nice tight engine.
Slap you a &quot;As Is-No Warranty&quot; sign in the window and you have something to
point to when the worn-out engine finally lets go in three weeks. Yes, a
quick oil analysis will quickly show that No Smoke Motor Oil Additive is in
there, but anyone who'd buy a car with an engine full of Motor Honey isn't
going to know about oil analysis either.
