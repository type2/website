Subject: Re: [T2] New bus report: Must be busma

Looks like you did well for yourself, Jeff.
Maybe it was worth the money.
In my experience buses that are &quot;free&quot; generally don't
stay &quot;free&quot;.
In fact they generally are only good to be freed of
all useful parts then sent to bus heaven.
Keep us informed on your successes &amp; adventures.
:-)

&gt; I picked up a new 78 bus this Saturday from another
&gt; list member. I
&gt; purchased this bus the way everybody says (from
&gt; experience) NOT to. Went to
&gt; look at it as it was supposed to be a good body for
&gt; the northeast and
&gt; unknown mechanicals. 8 passenger layout, really nice
&gt; interior, body has
&gt; some rust repair, a bad paint job and then surface
&gt; rust. Some rust on the
&gt; front beam. Battery tray badly repaired. 80K on the
&gt; odometer but no one is
&gt; sure if that's right. The tires are TOAST, can't
&gt; believe they hold air. The
&gt; exhaust is strangely pristine except for the
&gt; muffler, everything is really
&gt; nice, the cool tin under the push rod tubes is in
&gt; place.
&gt; 
&gt; The engine was a complete unknown. There is no
&gt; engine seal which should be
&gt; a warning that it may have overheated. The current
&gt; seller had purchased it
&gt; in non-running condition with some bizarre
&gt; instructions about sticking a
&gt; piece of wood into one of the exposed relays on the
&gt; double relay and there
&gt; was some mysterious &quot;extra&quot; wiring on the harness
&gt; near the double relay
&gt; plugs. He replaced the double relay and it still
&gt; didn't work, so he puts it
&gt; up for sale. So I buy it. No compression test, no
&gt; road test etc etc. Pay
&gt; too much for it, but the seller knows I'm hooked
&gt; (maybe I have a goofy grin
&gt; on my face?)
&gt; 
&gt; So essentially I had just paid $1000 for a bus that
&gt; would be free on the
&gt; west coast. It might have a blown engine, bad
&gt; tranny, bad brakes etc etc
&gt; etc. I have a spare engine, tranny, complete FI
&gt; system as spares for my 78
&gt; camper, but potential for a lot of labor. On the
&gt; plus side the owner tossed
&gt; in a tow bar and sourced a $100 replacement front
&gt; beam for me that turned
&gt; out to be an awesome adjustable with trailing arms,
&gt; drag link, KYBs and
&gt; brake rotors all attached. I put some plates on it
&gt; and AAA tows it home for
&gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; Sunday afternoon I finally had time to look at it.
&gt; Get out my VW FI trouble
&gt; shooting guide and start with the double relay, test
&gt; the double relay in my
&gt; other 78, works fine. Pull the extra wiring off, no
&gt; power. Look around and
&gt; notice that the wire to the coil is pulled off, in
&gt; fact the coil doesn't
&gt; have the extra push-on connectors for it. Swap coils
&gt; for a known good,
&gt; connect the wire, replace the fuse. Pump now works
&gt; when I push the AFM
&gt; flap. I crank it and no start. So I check the points
&gt; and they are fried.
&gt; Get my spare set of points in there, set the gap
&gt; with a feeler and it
&gt; starts roughly. Get my wife (I can't wait till my
&gt; kids are old enough to
&gt; turn the key for me, but at age 2 and 3.5 they
&gt; aren't yet) to crank it, set
&gt; the dwell with my new $10 dwell meter (thanks to the
&gt; guy that posted that
&gt; to the list) and it runs like a top. I checked the
&gt; timing and what I saw
&gt; while my cheapo timing light chose to work looked
&gt; within a few degrees of
&gt; correct. Still have to do a compression test to see
&gt; what kind of shape the
&gt; engine is in.
&gt; 
&gt; The bus has a short on the right side that is
&gt; blowing fuses when I use the
&gt; hazards or turn signals, the alternator light comes
&gt; on when I rev it so
&gt; still some stuff to work out. Additional finds, a
&gt; very nice 6 ply spare
&gt; under the cover in the rear, have to inflate it hard
&gt; to see if it's dry
&gt; rotted. A gas heater that is missing it's fuel pump
&gt; (the T is gone out of
&gt; the fuel line) but the combuster fan comes on when
&gt; you turn the knob. I
&gt; have 2 other gas heaters for spares so I might
&gt; actually get this one
&gt; working. have to go through and replace fuel lines,
&gt; filler neck and vent
&gt; lines. The charcoal cannister was removed but is in
&gt; 1 of the boxes of parts
&gt; that came with the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; This bus is also getting a very high approval rating
&gt; from the wife and
&gt; kids. I'm loking forward to a happy bus and hoping
&gt; my camper doesn't get
&gt; jealous and start throwing fits ;-)
