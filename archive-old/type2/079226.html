&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; We are into &quot;the joys of electronegativity&quot; here and way beyond my
&gt; league.  I am going to do the very barest basics below and  hope that
&gt; George Lyle or someone else who knows chemistry/physics will step in 
and
&gt; correct me if I stray.

You're pretty much right on.  There is a difference in that most of 
your data involves corrosion in the presence of a lot of water, not 
that at high temps.  Iron loves to corrode at high temps, and copper 
and brass less so.  Stainless seems to be best, but there are 
different varieties of stainless.

I find that the nuts used by Japanese cars on their manfolds work 
well, particularly when given a good dose of anti-sieze compound.  
Anti-sieze is good stuff when it comes time to disassemble!

George Lyle
