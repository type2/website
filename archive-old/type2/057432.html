Subject: Re: '79 Engine in an '81

&gt;   Whoa -- hold on there. Having gone the other route, putting an '81 
in
&gt;a '73, I can tell you that there isn't all that much difference. The
&gt;front and back tin and the side pieces might have to change, but I 
doubt
&gt;the fanhousing, alternator, and especially the heater boexes or exhaust
&gt;need changing. Nor does the oil fill tube or dipstick. 

You can keep the accessories with the engine if you don't change the 
tin.  If you change the tin, which you have to do, then you can't use 
the Bus parts.  Especially the alternator.  And if you can't use the Bus 
alternator then you sure as hell can't use the Bus fan housing.  And if 
you can't use the Bus fan housing, you can't use the Bus heat 
exchangers.  And if you can't use the Bus heat exchangers, then you 
can't use the Bus exhaust.  Of course, all this is assuming you are 
doing a proper installation.  



&gt;    I have no clue why you would think that not sealing the engine
&gt;compartment would have anything whatsoever to do with engine life. That
&gt;hasn't anything to do with cooling, you know? More dust in the engine
&gt;might require more frequent air filter changes I suppose, but that's
&gt;about all. In fact, if anything, the engine would run cooler.
&gt;
Whoa whoa whoa, misinformation alert.  I will disagree with you BIG-TIME 
on this one.  It has a LOT to do with cooling.  The engine would most 
certainly NOT run cooler.  It would run significantly hotter.  Think 
about it a bit.  Using what little I know of aerodynamics, air flowing 
straight under the van will wind up being of higher pressure than air 
that has to flow up and over the top of the van (this is how airplane 
wings work).  So any air flowing under will push its way into an 
unsealed engine compartment.  This air will first of course pass over 
the transmission, lower engine and exhaust, which will significantly 
warm the air.  Then due to the lack of a sealed engine compartment, this 
hot air will be sucked into the cooling fan and passed over the engine.  
This air will be significantly hotter than fresh cool air ducted in 
through the scoops on the side of the van.  Trying to cool your engine 
with hot air will INVARIABLY make the engine run hotter.  Also, while 
sitting at traffic light, for example, with the engine idling, you have 
a very hot exhaust sitting immediately below the cooling fan.  We all 
know that hot air rises.  This very hot air will rise and go straight 
into the cooling fan.  Again, this goes back to attempting to cool an 
engine with hot air.  It just don't work and it WILL negatively impact 
engine life.  There's no way around it.  And of course all that extra 
dust being blown over the engine and settling on top of surfaces that 
need to be kept clean for engine cooling will also make it run hotter.  
There is NO WAY it will run cooler.  No way.

If you don't have a properly sealed engine compartment, your Bus is 
overheating, PERIOD.  There's no debate about it.
