Dear List,

My interests have changed and I need to sell my 1968 Westphalia.  
It's in good condition, some minor rust, runs and drives great, 
15,000 miles on engine.  New carb, new fuel pump, new german 
fuel lines, new fuel filter, and the fuel tank is epoxy sealed.

I've owned it since Feb. '98, I am the second owner.

$2,500.00 OBO  Located in SW Missouri.

Please resond to me at gcvw67_at_aol_dot_com or call 417-890-0275
