Me too.  I've found a new way to tell what my oil level is, but it requires 
an oil pressure gauge.  If you go around a turn, the oil will run to one 
side of the sump and may starve the pickup tube depending on your oil level 
and how fast you take the turn.

When the level is approximately full, I can  take just about any turn with 
no drop in pressure.  When I'm 1/2 quart low, taking a freeway offramp at a 
spirited velocity will cause the pressure to drop.  When I'm *really* low, 
I can make the level drop much more easily, like turning a street corner or 
entering a parking lot.

I don't use this as a primary method of measuring the oil level, but it's a 
nice sanity check.  No oil on dipstick?  Make a quick left turn.  Oil 
pressure drop?  Yep, it's definately low, add some.  :)
