Subject: How to Find TDC?
Message-ID: &lt;372efc7cHow to Find TDC?*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;To find the top of the stroke, you can remove the spark plug and feel for it 
with a stiff wire or something through the spark plug
&gt;hole. I understand that in the Type IV taking the spark plugs out is some 
sort of tortuous ordeal but it's really the only way if you
&gt;truly don't have any mark to refer to.

another method, one I've always used, to find TDC on any particular cylinder, 
type 1, 2 or 4 engine,
 is to watch the valves on the opposite side of the motor. first, take off 
both valve covers. 
For #1 TDC establish a line of site along the tappet screws for the #3 valves 
(you have to stretch a bit for the T4)
and as you turn the crank, when you approach TDC, the #3 intake and #3 
exhaust will be moving; one coming out, then the other
going in. at the exact point where both line up in your line of site, where 
neither are actually moving, but aligned, is your TDC for
#1. Take this opportunity to file a mark at 12 o'clock in your pulley, so 
you're timing will never be off again. 
Repeat as needed with the other 3 cylinders.
