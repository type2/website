Subject: bad idle

Sympoms: the bus runs good at high speeds and at cold start up. However when
slowing for a turn or before I even get to a stoplight the bus will try to die
on me. I have to put it in Park (automatic) and when the light turns drop it
in drive...too much or too little gas and it dies, the weber carb making a
&quot;sploot&quot;  noise. The bus will start immediatly after dieing and will generally
go if I feather the gas pedal.

Analysis/history: the bus had been running great. I changed all the fuel lines
to brand new German and a new fuel filter before the pump. We set the timing
before High Country and the bus zoomed up the mountains and drove fine on the
way back. The problem has been getting progressively worse in the last week,
starting with just idling poorly at a light.

I do not believe it is the brake vacum because even if I don't apply the
brakes at all I have this problem. Also it does not make any &quot;popping&quot; noises
on a hard decelleration. I replaced the brand new filter with another brand
new filter and no difference (checked all connections and the fuel line is dry
as a bone). I also adjusted the idle screw to no avail and the bus would high
rev in Park, so I turned it back (one turn).

Is this an obvious gas issue or could it be my timing? The fuel pump seems to
be fine as I don't have to pump the gas to restart the bus.

The bus is a 77 automatic with single weber carb and aftermarket fuel pump
(set to 3 psi).

PS. I was telling everybody at High Country the bus has run fantastic for a
year so I guess I deserved it. haha
