Subject: Re: Platinum plugs?

&gt;T2s need to use BOSCH W6AC plugs because the engine works harder and hotter 
&gt;pushing the load of the bus.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;I have heard, though, that platinum plugs will stick in cylinder heads and
&gt;&gt; will become nigh on impossible to remove.  (They last tens of thousands of
&gt;&gt; miles (in a healthy engine)&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 

etc.

I use an anti-sieze lubricant on all sparks plugs, everytime.  Why risk any
plug thread problems at all?  Any plug does seem get more stuck when they've
been overheated, but that may or may not have been the fault of the plug
(probably not).  I've got the platinums W8AP (stock temp) and they have run
beautifully so far and I believe helped pass smog.
