Subject:  Removing fuel pump and stuff...

Mrten asked:

&gt; * How in the world is one to undo the above bolt
&gt; that holds the pump to the crankcase? 

This is in fact possible... it requires just the right tool, and lots of
patience!  But in my opinion, it is easier than removing the warm air
duct... at least in my '72, which doesn't have the top engine hatch. On a
later Bus, it may well be quicker and easier to pull the duct off; I've
never had the opportunity to find out. But with that disclaimer out of the
way, on to the good stuff!

The ideal tool is actually a combination of two: a ratchet spanner and a
straight Allen driver that is just the right length. It has to be long
enough to clear the fuel pump, but not so long that it would run into the
warm air duct. About 3 inches, if memory serves. The ratchet spanner
slides up between the duct and the pump, and turns the Allen driver at a
right angle.

Not quite so ideal, but more readily available, is a 90deg Allen driver,
with relatively long proportions. Most cheap ones have a &quot;long&quot; leg of
around 3 inches and a &quot;short&quot; leg of an inch or so; this won't work. The
&quot;short&quot; leg should be around 2.5 - 3 inches, so that it will fit, as in
the previous description, between the pump and the duct. Doing the job
with this tool is tedious, because you're working blind and can only
rotate the bolt a small amount at a time... but it will work!
