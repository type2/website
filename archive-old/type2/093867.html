Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA part numbers

Well..new in this case means an actual VW certified refurbished engine 
done in a VW plant.  I have one in my westy.  It still has all the 
stickers and marking on it.  The refurbished engines i have seen all 
appeared to have new heads and jugs on them.

&gt; The receipt shows that this was purchased and installed in 1988.
&gt; PO ordered it from a placed called 'small car world:parts and machine' 
&gt; for a total of $1599.20 (not including $100 core charge)
&gt;
&gt; He did say there was a new motor in it, but I didn't know if he meant 
&gt; new rebuilt, just new heads, or what.
&gt;
&gt; Good news if it was a new motor, as that would put it at only about 
&gt; 44,000 miles so far. I did have a compression check a few months back 
&gt; when something else was acting up, and was over 160 on all 4, if I 
&gt; remember correctly.
