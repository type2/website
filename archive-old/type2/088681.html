ok, I need help! I've got an 81' cal. model westy. it seems to run       =
with no fuel pressure!
#1) 3 of the 4 injectors can be unplugged and it still runs =20
#2) it runs better on 2 than four
#3) will run with AFM unplugged, fuel pump shuts off, no pressure in =
lines for 30-40 minutes
#4) unplug vac. booster and it revs to 3000 and stays
#5) bypass cold start-runs 10-15 min.
#6) checks valves are good
#7) fuel will still run thru it, pressure test is good
all of the usual has been tested or replaced and tested again!(AFM, =
double relay, O2 sensor, cyl temp sensor, etc. per Bently . even swaped =
ecu's w/no effect!
original prob. was that it would start and run for approx. 10 min. then =
die. pumping gas pedal had no effect
is there a &quot;zen mechanic&quot; out there that might fathom this situation as =
the analytical approach does not seem to be working for me OR my usually =
very competent support group?
p.s. email answers/suggestions/prayers to me direct
         thanks in adv.,  a. hoffmann
                                      smithfield, ut.
