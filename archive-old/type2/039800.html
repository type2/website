Subject: Hot tip for errant vinyl trim in Westys

This one works:  The &quot;T&quot; trim around the inside of the opening (and the
outside of the flip table over  the sink, along the vertical, exposed edge
of the closet cabinet, etc.) has sagged, shrunk, etc. on my bus.  On the
worst spot, the flip down door opposite the spare tire well, the trim had
shruck completely away from the casework and twisted a little.  It didn't
hit the curve at all.  I softened it with an electric paint stripping gun
set on low, and just pressed it back into the slot.  I help it it place
(with a rag) until cool, and it's still there.  Big improvement.

It worked just as well on the shortened trim around the sink cover, but it's
still got a gap.  On the other hand, two puckers in the vertical trim
re-puckered after a day, even after they looked smooth and were cool to the
touch.  I'm going to try the heat, plus a little epoxy next time.

Still, better than it used to be.
