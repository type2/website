Has anyone seen the Tool Tip in the December issue of VW Trends (page 35)? A
mechanic named Robert Heil from VW Paradise in CA has come up with a way to
lube your CV joints making sure that they are lube properly and completely
and cleanly. By making a &quot;gaget&quot; that attaches to the CV joint with a grease
fitting on it. You just simply pump your grease through the fitting and this
gives you a clean and good grease pack.

My question is--Has any one made one of these and can I borrow it? It is
easily made, but I would rarely use it. I have 4 CV joints to clean and
repack with new boots to install and this would be nice to use. Anyone got
one that I can borrow? If not, I guess I'll make one.

TIA
