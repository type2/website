Subject: Re: [T2] Does your bus stay warm?

&gt; I am curious if anyone out there has a 78 T2 bus with the factory heating
&gt; system (heat exchange) that actually keeps you warm in the winter.

Before taking my winter road trip (saw some snow) in January I went
over the stock heater system on my '77 and fixed everything.  It would
blow plenty hot - like to burn your fingers, but my problem was it 
seemed the heat would escape the bus as fast as it blew in.  It was
thus not always adequate.  We learned to hang a blanket behind the
front seats to trap the hot air up front and to wear blankets ourselves.
For it to work better I'd need to seal the bus better and maybe a stronger
blower would help too.  I don't know if it would clear an icy windshield
or not..  

Good luck,
