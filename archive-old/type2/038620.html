Subject: Clutch cable drama

Happy Easter!!!!!
I was going to adjust my clutch freeplay today and I didn't get around
to it.So I went for a spin in my 68 Westfalia and I shifted into second
and the clutch pedal dropped to the floor.I pulled over and took off the
panel under the bus and I found the clutch cable was disconnected.I went
to hook it back up and noticed there was a bolt that was used to attach
the cable to the clutch lever.I thought there was suppose to be a clevis
pin instead.Does anybody know if a 68 had a bolt and nut or a pin to
hold on the cable?Will the bolt work, I was afraid to put it on because
it might tighten down and not let the cable move freely.

Thanks,
Casey
