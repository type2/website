Subject: URL for Bay nose replace?
Message-ID: &lt;374C9D7B.425C5A22_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;

I've been randomly searching for an hour now...  Not on Josh's pages, archives
aren't responding (Steve!!!) and I know that I've seen it...  Anyone know the
URL to the page that had the photos and text of re-nosing a Bay?  (I found a volunteer!!!)
