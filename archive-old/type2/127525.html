Subject: sparkplug washer removal

sparkplug washer removal

hello,

tonight, after work, i installed a pertronix points
replacement.  it went easily enough.  the only hitch
was that all three of the male spade terminals on my
coil's positive side were being used.  
having one of those nifty little connectors that turns
one male spade into two would have solved my problem,
but for a temp fix i just crimped a doughnut connector
onto my cut-off switch wire, and put it on the stud
coming out of the coil, before the nut.  jeez...that
came off a lot more complicated than it was.  but it
worked, and now i can forget about checking my points.

anyway, i wanted to let my spark plug threads cool off
before i took out plug #3 to install my brand new vdo
cht kit.  so here is my problem.  the instructions say
to take off the spark plug's washer.  i searched the
archives and everyone says to take it off.  

HOW??  

maybe it's late, but i can't figure it out.  im trying
to remove it either by screwing it off of the threads,
or prying it over the threads.  no go...im just
deforming it.  this is a new bosch super w8ac that i'm
fooling with.  if i had some tin snips id try to just
snip it in two.  is there an easier solution?  im
figuring that leaving it on will give the plug that
much less insertion into the combustion chamber.  is
it a big no-no to leave the washer in place, with the
cht sender below it?  i've been messing with it
thinking, &quot;don't wuss out and ask the list for help
removing a frigging washer!!&quot;, but obviously i wussed.


thanks,
jon
