Subject: Re: Corvair spark plug seals

They might be spark plug boots - here's a link to Clark's Corvair catalog
page with them, but no picture.

&gt;Hi List,
	I have read that Corvair spark-plug air-seals are &quot;better&quot; than
&gt;original VW style ones.  Where does one go about purchasing them?  Part
&gt;numbers? Terminology (what is the Chev* name for them)? I have looked on
&gt;various Corvair pages but have not been able to find any mention of
them,
&gt;let alone pictures/numbers.  Thanks . jon
