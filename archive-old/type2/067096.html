Subject: Re: info needed: pulling '77 FI engine

&gt;hey now,
&gt;
&gt;i need some info on dropping the engine in my '77 westy.

Having done this ever so recently on my 76 let me say this: Use the Muir
guide.  It is invaluable, both in helping you through and keeping you sane
through what (for me at least) proved to be a very emotional experience (my
bus and I are very close).  All I can say is jack it way the hell up in the
air.  I mean way, way up in the air. We aren't so fortunate as some of
those earlier bus owners who can take out that panel below the engine hatch.


Also, there is some stuff which it has been recommended to me that I
replace as well while it is out: pushrod seals, oil cooler seals, main
engine seals (which you are already doing the front); and some stuff on the
transmission which I didn't pay attention to because I have an automatic,
which has problems of its own.

Good luck, it's not as hard as it seems.  And be careful with those engine
studs.

Eric
Maggie
