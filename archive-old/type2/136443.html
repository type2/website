The bus is my bosses.  Just talked to her about but haven't seen it yet.  It has been garaged most of its life.  Her family is the only owner.  It needs a new windshield, has one dent on the side door, the defrost works, but the van doesn't warm up too much inside, and it doesn't run right now.  She said basic maintenance, don't know how many miles.  Mainly lived in CA for its life.  Thanks for all the info so far, will be looking at it soon.  And it's dirt cheap so I'll probably go for it.  I can do all the body, electrical and maintenance myself if needed.
