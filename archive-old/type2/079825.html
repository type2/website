Subject: Re: [T2] Transmission


&gt; Group,
&gt;
&gt; How much power can the Bus tranny put up with on a regular basis?  Some
people use the Bus tranny for the Corvair conversion, what if you hopped up
the Corvair 6,  I also saw an adapter for a Quad 4.  Any thoughts?
&gt;

Two thoughts:

1. The Corvair transaxle ratios will be a much better match to the
application.

2. It's just too easy to use the Corvair transaxle, using Transvair
components.
