Subject: Re: Engine Removal

&gt; &gt; I recently obtained a 71 Westy. I want to remove the engine and being 
&gt; &gt; completely new to Buses I was planning on using the directions on Muir's 
&gt; 
&gt; You have to decide if you want to pull the engine and the transmission as
&gt; a unit or to support the tranmission and pull the engine alone.  Both
&gt; methods work well.

On an early loaf I would never consider pulling the engine and tranny
together. Its so easy to pull the motor and then if you want the tranny
out there is plenny room to get to the CVs.
Id estimate thats its more than twice the work to pull them together and
what a load to handle.
