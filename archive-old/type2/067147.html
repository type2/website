Subject: Honeymoon in Arkansas

We drove the '69 Westy &quot;We Made It!&quot;, away from our sweet wedding on Saturday, 
and headed straight for Hot Springs Arkansas from Dallas.  Hooray!! 
&quot;We made it!&quot; went up a MOUNTAIN!!!  In third gear almost!!!!  We dug up 
crystals and actually had a place to put them!!!  This was We Made It's 
first real trip with us. 

Some problems made themselves evident on this trip, but nothing stopped us.

When driving at Highway speeds, the van has started steering herself, feels
like driving a boat.  You can maintain a lane ok, but it's kind of a wave
to the left, then right, then left, then right, the whole way.

Also (and probably the reason for that I suppose) the van has become a real
squeakwagen.  I think it is the shock absorber on the passenger side, because
it is a constant squeak-creak sound from right under the seat.  

New shocks?  front end alignment?  What brand/type shocks do you
recommend?  She does 20 miles/gallon on 93 octane.  Used/leaked less than
1 pint of oil the whole round trip.  (I did anticipate the oil leaks
and put the litter box under there while we were in the national park,
and I hope everyone else does the same.   Doesn't leak &quot;much&quot;.  
Volkswagen you know.)

Camping was wonderful.  Gina hasn't finished our curtains yet, so we 
improvised by hanging clothes in the windows.  The trip was fantastic
though short.  I'm so lucky to have found a woman who wants to be 
taken from her wedding in a VW bus, drive to the mountains for a 
honeymoon where we camped out, walked in the forest, and dug in the 
mud for crystals.  We're so proud of We Made It!.  She gets a new
custom canvas top and some front end work I guess!
