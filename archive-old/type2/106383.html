Subject: re:brake wire part number

I wrote:
Does anyone know what the name of (or part Number even better) of the wires
that go from the master cylinder to the fusebox on a 71? It is for a Single
cab but should be the same as a bus I would think.

----------------------------

To clear up confusion...
I am looking more for a harness type setup. There are several wires
going from the electrical part of the master cylinder to the fuse box. It
also has two sockets on the master cylinder end.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
