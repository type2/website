Subject: Re: Do two thin wires = one thick wire

Just to muddy things a little bit, dredging up some high school electronics
knowledge, what about the Faraday effect? That is that electrons travel on
the surface of the wire so stranded wire has less resistance then solid
wire. My point being that 3-4 piece of 16WG will have more strands then
10AWG and then in theory lower resistance? Is this pertinent? Otherwise you
could just use some 10-2 Romex which is far cheaper then 10AWG wire, has
better insulation too (but is a pain to run through an auto since it
doesn't flex very well). After all VW did use 12-2 to wire the outside
outlet on the campers (at least someone did on both of mine) and supplies
enough amps to charge the battery (6 Amps I think).
