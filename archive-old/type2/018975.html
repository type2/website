Subject:  oil pressure trouble far from home

Hi All,

I am currently on a road trip in Utah. I live in
Vancouver B.C. so right now we are a long way from
home. When we set off this morning the oil pressure
warning light and buzzer went off (the van is an '86
Vanagon GL Westy). We have had some initial
discussions with a mechanic who does not seem to think
we actually have an oil pressure problem (no lifter
noises). I have done some reading on the dynamic oil
pressure system which has pointed me towards the high
pressure side of the system. There is no problem with
idle, but  alarm goes off immediately when revs exceed
2000). After I finish typing this message I am going
to attempt to replace the high pressure sensor (I just
bought a new one) to see if this fixes the problem).
Ideally I would like to have a mechanic attach a real
sensor to the engine to detect whether or not we
actually have a problem. Right now we are in Beaver,
Utah and will probably attempt to drive to Las Vegas
this afternoon. Can anyone recommend a good VW
mechanic in these parts? I was also wondering about
the possibility of fooling the high pressure sensor
into thinking everything was fine. I realize this is
not the brightest idea, but if it turns out that the
pressure is a bit low but still acceptable, it will be
better that listening to the buzzer. From the reading
I have done I think that this could be accomplished by
grounding the sensor lead. Any comments on this idea
would be appreciated. Thanks,

Steve Wickham.
86 Westy
