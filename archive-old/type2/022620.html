I am about to clean and redue some wiring in my 76 non pop westy.  I will be installing a new pump for the sink, wiring a cd changer and adding rear speakers and the cigarette accesory adapter.  What is the best fuse to run this stuff off or is there a wiring diagram avaiable online somewhere, web page etc.???  Also I am still looking for people wanting to hit a few father land VW shows with me this summer.  If you are cool and clean I'd help with accomadations ann provide transportation in my 76 Westy, just looking for a few more VW nuts to hang with....
Peace Out
