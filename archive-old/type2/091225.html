Subject: wasserbox temptation

A neighbor has a wasserbox for sale: $1,500
Great shape. NO rust, couple dents.
runs well, with no leakage.
HUGE inside.

I know this is an aircooled list and I've owned
several aircooled VWs, but are wasserboxes a really
bad idea?

if the engine goes bad, Is it possible to drop an
aircooled engine into one?
