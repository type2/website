Subject: Re: [T2] Shifter Plate

Man! I suck! I looked all over Bus Depot and could NOT find it!?

Thanks! I went ahead and ordered it. I don't need it immediately since it
doesn't run this very minute anyway... but I went ahead and ordered one from
Ron along with some other stuff I need.


Thanks!!!!

Todd

  in the mean time take the one you got and have someone barely touch it with
a welder til busdepot gets you a new one.....it will hold for a bit or should
jus make sure that they dont make it thick and keep the weld small if its not
to bad crumbly to even weld...?



  good luck and dont forget to read the bentley on this subject....
  the bentley tells you exactly what to do here....
