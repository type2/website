Subject: RE: [T2] Cylinder head temp Sensor

This sounds like what my bus was doing.  Turned out to be a problem
in the distributer.  Check to see if your points gap is also
adjusting itself erratically.  When you notice it change, stop and
check your points, see if you can move the rotor.  Forward and
backward movement or left and right movement.  See if it moves in
directions other than what the engineers intended.  My solution was
a replacement vac. distrib.  Something to take a peep at, in any
event.
