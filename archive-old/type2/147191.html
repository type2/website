Subject: Re: [T2] Autobraking (Brake pedal gets &quot;sucked&quot; down when I,
  decellerate)

Hi Zach,

I have the exact same problem in my 72 Saab which uses an ATE brake 
booster just like the one in the 71 type2 only smaller. Like someone 
else that replied to your post, I have pulled the vac line from the 
booster and stuck a tight fitting rubber plug into the line until I am 
able to get it fixed. I talked to H &amp; R Rebuilders in texas and it 
sounded like he had seen this problem before and that he could fix it 
while rebuilding the booster. H &amp; R is mentioned in the type2 archives 
for rebuilding boosters but here is their info:

H &amp; R Auto Parts Rebuilders
10328 Oakwood Dr, Dallas, TX 75217
Phone: (972) 286-5516

Good luck,
Bill Moon
