Subject: Re: [T2] How do I mount this thing??? - I'm done.

Thanks for all the tips, but I am done with this
thing. I have gotten zero response from Bus Depot in
any respect and am therefore sending it back. I really
don't want to drill holes to mount it and would
frankly like to find a nice tire cover instead at this
point.

Needless to say, between exceptionally long times for
shipping and poor communication, I am very
disappointed in Bus Depots customer service. I still
plan on purchasing things from them here and there,
but at this point, I would rather give my money to
Chris at Busted Bus. At least he replies to personal
emails in a reasonable amount of time.
