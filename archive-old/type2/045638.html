Subject: [T2] one wheel trailer info wanted

List:
In the BNNTA pictures someone was there with a one wheel trailer.
I believe these were made in the 50's-60's and sold by Sears (Allstate
brand?). I kinda remember seeing one behind a type 1. I suppose one
could get brackets for many different vehicles. I've rescued a chassis
from one and I'd like to put it to use. So, does anyone out there have
knowledge about how they were hooked onto type 2's, or better yet the
bracket themselves for just about any application which I would gladly
buy or simply get a few jpg's?(Then I could fabricate my own.)
I'm probably going to pull this with a Vanagon, so brackets may never
have been factory made by 1980.
TIA,
