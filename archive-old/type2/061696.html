&gt; Well, I had a little extra cash so I sprung for the big box :-)  A 2.2
&gt; liter Mark Stephens Stage II!  Conversations I have had with various and
&gt; sundry people convinced me that the larger engine was a good idea in the
&gt; larger van ('80 Westy). 
 &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Their ad says that the 2.2 will run on the stock FI, OK... but when you
&gt; call it means &quot;with a bit of tweaking on the AFM mix screw&quot;.  Has anyone
&gt; gone to the bigger engine and done the tweaking?  Was the stock FI up to
&gt; it?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyone else who has gone this route?  Are you happy?
Steve: 
Sounds mostly on target to me.
I had a 78 bus that I rebuilt in 85 with big bore 96 mm.NPR p&amp;c's,(bout
2055cc)  72-74 type cam, 74 heads (bigger valves than 1.7 or 2.0 heads),
and stock FI and exhaust.
I called the Bosch people in Illinois and talked to some really nice guy
with a German accent and what he said was this:
1. we can't tell you how to do this if you're driving on the street, but
if it's for RACING, it is for racing, right? Then do this-
2. all these parts are pretty compatible and within the range of the FI
system, but you'll need to be richer throughout the rpm range, so fool
the FI into thinking that the motor is colder by adding some resistance
to the cylinder head sensor. They thought 500-1000 ohms would be good.
So I bought a 1000ohm pot (potentiometer), hooked it up like a
rheostat,inline with the temp sensor, and dialed in the motor by seat if
the pants dyno method.
I think this should work for you with the 2.2. A Cal type FI with oxy
sensor might make the changes automatically, but what I did was quite
easy.
As far as CR goes, I never checked mine, but I think 8.0 is the upper
limit, 7.7-7.8 would be less worry.(but less power and mpg)
By the way I put 60,00 miles on the motor, many at sustained speeds
75-85, the bus rusted away and I still have the motor. I have a 72 westy
that needs it (someday).
