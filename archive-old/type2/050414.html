Subject: [T2] friday question

Good morning volks!

Tomorrow is the day for me to drive home my new '76 Westy and guess 
what?...I have a question.  The bus has been sitting on a wooded lot for 
about a year and has a family of mice living in it.  What tipped me 
off?...lots of mice excrement and a mouse franticly trying to escape the 
engine compartment when I started it last.

So, I know DeCon is a bad method.._dot_dead smelly carcasses and such, how 
would you lovely individuals rid my new beauty of the mice colony.  I know 
where the nest is, so I figured I would start there.  I was hoping they 
would all just bail out on the hour drive home, but I'm sure that won't happen.

A friend suggested parking it in a large mall parking lot...since they have 
to leave the bus to go somewhere for food...maybe they just wouldn't come back.

Any thoughts?
Thanks in advance.
