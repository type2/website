About a week or so ago someone posted this link:
http://www.aircooledtechnology_dot_com/Home_Page.htm It is Jake Rabys site. He
has some great info there on type 4 engines and why to put one in your
Bug/early Bus. He also has engines for late Buses. Anyway, he will answer
your question about the bottom end strength.

Subject:	[T2] Tom Wilson rebuild book question

Hello all, I've got questions for those who have rebuilt 72-79 motors type4.

I've just read in Tom Wilson's How to rebuild book the following &quot;Bullet 
proof best describes the type 4 bottom end.  If you could ruin it with 
spirited driving, you could probably destroy an anvil with a rubber mallet.&quot;

Do those of you with experience agree with the above statement?  The next 
question is how to differentiate between top and bottom end problems without

splitting case.  Is it possible?  Here is my understanding of bottom end: 
crank and cam shaft and bearings.  Top end: pistons, cylinders, valves and 
heads.  Am I on the right page.  Enlighten me please.  Marcus
