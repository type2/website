Subject: Re: Starting This Year's First Unending Heater Thread

I've always thought that there should be an easy way to use the propane stove
as a heater in my 76 Westy, something like put a small stove pipe with the
heater vanes in it like the old wood stoves years ago.

In sending the exhaust out of the interior it won't get too much condensation
from the propane and some of the air would be replaced steadily also. Maybe a
small 12 volt computer fan could go on it to circulate the air and the exhaust
would go out the left side rear window. It could be double-walled so no one
touches it and burns themselves.

Just thinking creatively here!

I have used the propane stove on very, very low to add some heat on cold
nights in the mountains north of LA and actually felt colder because of all
the moisture it and I created!
