&gt; &lt;&lt; My '69 Westy had O.E.M. (I.E., dealer installed)
&gt;  shocks when I bought it. They were 5 years old, but
&gt;  still working properly at the time &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'm glad you enjoy the Gas Adjusts...but you truly
&gt; can not compare 5 year old 
&gt; shocks with new ones.  Apples to oranges.

True. But...while &quot;gas&quot; shocks and &quot;oil&quot; shocks
perform the same function, they both perform
differently. 

&quot;Gas&quot; shocks 'rebound' more quickly than &quot;oil&quot;....this
too, is a fact. If you doubt this, do your own
&quot;due-dilligence&quot;.


So...in driving a 30+year-old vehicle, do you want to
drive it &quot;as-it-was&quot; 30+years ago? If so, do you drive
on non-radial tires (I.E., do you actually have tubes
in your tires....like they *came* from the factory)?

C'mon...

Gas-shocks are a *serious* improvement in *HANDLING*
technology, IMHO.


&gt; 
&gt; Either way I'll be interested to hear if anyone has
&gt; anything to say about 
&gt; these Boge shocks after installing them.

Yeah, me too! Especially if they've driven/own/owned
busses equipped with gas-shocks.


Like I said...sorry!
