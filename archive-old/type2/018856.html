&gt; &gt; i took the test and scored 54%nuts, but i think the questions are skewed

&gt; 
&gt; yeah, me too, I scored 52%
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; one question:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Assuming you own a VW, do you insist on washing it once a week?
&gt; &gt; ...once a day?
&gt; &gt; ...more than once a day?
&gt; &gt; Would you rather wash and wax your VW than go to a party?
&gt; 
&gt; Wash?????  dirt protects the metal from rust
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i mean, i'd drag a basket case vw 400 miles, and i've driven 1200 miles to
&gt; &gt; buy a transmission, but i think i may have washed my vw once... i think...
&gt; 
&gt; well not 1200 miles but pretty near
&gt; 
&gt; Drive the bugger, all mine were daily drivers,
&gt; today I drive a 78 FI AT and my ONLY vehicle...20,000+ miles last year!

&gt;Gil:
&gt;Kevin Lichty contacted me regarding your need for a transmission part
&gt;for a bus with an automatic. I have such a transmission (type 003) that
&gt;was a working transmission, and I have dissassembled it to sell parts.
&gt;Please get back to me with the best description of the part. You can
&gt;also call me at 319-961-0599 anytime 9:00 am to 12 midnite CDT. I have
&gt;this phone with me, so I'm at that number most of the time.

Respond to him, not me unless you want the parts I'd offered him. My
trans is apart, (003), missing the double wrapped band and its piston.
I'll send you any parts from it you like.
I have no idea whereabouts Gil is located, think it's in the US, though!
