&lt;&lt; You could always loan it to another busser...

That will keep it maintained and on the road. =D

Even if the bus is outside, if it's kept clean and
started and warmed up every few days and driven
around the block a few times every week or so it
would be in virtually the same shape that you left
it...Storage without extreme precautions will deter-
iorate the bus much more than occasional use...
