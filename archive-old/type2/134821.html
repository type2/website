Subject: Re: [T2] Heater lever

I may have some left at $9.95 each these are good used ones.
Rocky Mountain Motor Works had only the blue ones and Mid American 
Motorworks still list them for $5.95 as well I think that some dealers may 
still have some.
 
If you need them please call to order as our site is a little messed up 
still.
