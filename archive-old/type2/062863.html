Thanks for the message.  Couldn't agree more.

there seems to be a lot of talk about the rarity of buses.  I live in
Seattle, and you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bus here.  They
are everywhere.  I have three on my block alone.  I see aobut 20-25 of them a
day, not counting Vanagons (which seem rarer).  Maybe we just have a glut
and I should keep quiet about it or risk losing them all :)
