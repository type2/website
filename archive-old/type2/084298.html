Subject: Re: [T2] Key buzzer?

Hope I'm not out of line for reposting this but I didn't get much of a
response. I found the wire going from the drivers door light switch to the
fuse box in the wiring diagram in Bently. It does indicate the socket is for
a Key buzzer. Still looking for part numbers, and availability. Does anyone
have a buzzer they don't want? Any clues are most appreciated.

&gt; Today while troubleshooting the dome light switch on my drivers door, I
&gt; found an extra wire connected at one end to a contact on the dome light
&gt; switch and the other connected to a socket under the fuse panel. No
&gt; buzzer or relay in the socket. I'm famous for locking my keys in the bus
&gt; so I'm wondering if this is really a socket for a buzzer of some sort
&gt; and if so is the part still available? Part Number? Could I wire in a
&gt; Piezo buzzer or some other noise maker?
&gt; Thanks,
