Subject: junkyard in VT/MA?
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;I have heard about a VW junkyard on Rt 5 in MA somewhere near Yankee Candle
&gt;from the in-laws. Unfortunately the better half finds visiting junkyards

5 north in whateley, past Troubadour books, somewhere between northhampton and
yankee candle there
might be a VW related site, if not it might be past that moving towards
greenfield on 5 north. (about 15 minutes north
of Springfield on 91) I can't guarantee it, but seem to remember something
there. It might not be a junkyard, it might
be a shop with a bunch of VWs laying around.
