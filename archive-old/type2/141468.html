Subject: Re: [T2] Bosch or siemens ECU rebuilders?

Mark

I have had great service with http://www.siaelec_dot_com/   I had them fix a
bosch unit a few years ago with the R+R service through  ecudirect_dot_com.
Good price and can't beat the warranty, and if you need it flashed to the
VIN they do that too.

Hope that helps you out.



&gt; Does anybody know of any place that rebuilds these units.  I have a couple
of
&gt; jap ECU rebuilders but they won't do bosch or siemens   thanks  Mark
