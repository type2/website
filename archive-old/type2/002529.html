Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Further to Brake Drums, etc...


&gt;I'll check the rotors against a 10mm wrench this afternoon.  And, I am sad
&gt;to report that the pistons DID NOT go back into the caliper easily to make
&gt;room for the pads.  In fact, I had to use a screwdriver laid across the
&gt;piston with as-even-as I could get pressure to force them back in... if my
&gt;caliper is hosed, can it be rebuilt

I had the same problem, it turned out it was a swollen shut brake hose.
Might want to replace your brake hoses.  Calipers can be rebuilt, the kits
are readily available.
