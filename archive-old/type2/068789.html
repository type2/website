Subject: My Powder Coating dude...

I've had a number of you ask me about my powder coating that I have been 
having done on my engine tin, rims, etc.  I called up Jim Kruse (the guy 
that does the work) and he was thrilled to hear that I was posting my 
stories about his work on Internet.  I thought that just in case any of 
you were wanting to contact him to have some stuff done (he's pretty 
cheap based on what I hear from several of you members) I'd post his stats:
 
Kruse's Custom Powder Coating
205 Livingston Street
Box 69
Filley, NE 68357
402-662-3060

If you do call for pricing or anything, tell him that you got the number 
from &quot;Erin Lassley in Beatrice - the VW guy that you did the rims for.&quot;  
He'll know then...

So, there you have it - let me know if you want me to contact him and ask 
any more questions for you all...
