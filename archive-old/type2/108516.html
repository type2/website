Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt distributors???

You should always set the ignition timing for the distributor that you are
using, not the engine.

This is why it's so important to know which distributor you have, not the
engine's serial #.

If the distributor has 1 vacuum hose, the correct timing should be 7.5 BTDC
At idle, which is almost the same as the 009. It's a good idea to verify the
other timing behavior of the unit, with yours check it at 3500 RPM with the
hose disconnected, you should have about 30-32 total (imagine, just like a
009). Adding the hose should give you another 10-13 degrees of advance.
42-45 total IS ACCEPTABLE. If you are 1/2 or more throttle, the vacuum
advance is 0, so you are back to the 32 total (same as 009) anyways, so I do
not know where all the paranoia is coming from (usually 009 Nazis that claim
they are the best thing around). If the vac advance fails, you practically
have a 009 anyways, so I don't see why removing it to begin with is such an
&quot;improvement&quot;.

The added off-idle timing of vac advance will mean no hesitation, and you
don't have to richen the crap out of the carb jetting to cover it up.
