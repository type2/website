Subject: Type 4 Distributor

I have a '76 Westy with 103,000 miles on the chassis and about 12,000 since
an engine rebuild. I'm having a problem with the distributor. Rather, the
vacuum advance kicks in and out. I'v replaced the usual parts - points, cap
rotor, wires et cetera - and I've managed to massage it so the beastie runs,
but not well and not consistently. I checked the dwell and it's okay so I
think the shaft is fine. The vacuum advance seems to be the problem. I think
there's a diaphram leak. So far all I can come up with is either buy a new
one (about $500 from Bosch) or buy a used one.

Suggestions? Does anyone rebuild these puppies? Is there an alternative to
paying the big bucks for a new one. I'd like to resolve this sometime soon
as my wife and I really enjoy camping, but inconsistent performance,
especially on hills, makes us hesitant to take a long trip. It strikes me
there have been several threads along this line, but I can't seem to locate
the archives. 

Thanks to all,

John Baird
