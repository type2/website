&gt; I've been running 20w-50 dino for two years

&gt; Should I switch or stay with what Im' using now?

my policy is to never make changes to something working right before a big
trip,  while Synth is great stuff, I,ve used it for years it is also
thinner and will find any leaks you have it also might clean some gunk out
of your engine and foul up the filter...  so unless you have time to run a
1,000 miles with it before you go, and you haven't been having any trouble
with what you are using, I would wait until your back and then change.

YMMV
