&gt; so i got to arizona today and i looked at a pretty rough '71 westy. I got
&gt; there as the dealer was closing, so i didn't get to drive it - i'm going
&gt; back tomorrow for that. but the price is right - only $1995 and negotiable.

that sounds awfully high to me, keep negotiating

&gt; They say the engine is fine, and i have a gut feeling that these are honest
&gt; people [plus a few folks on the list have recommended them].

honest is good, but if it is for sale they want to sell it.  clevaet
emptor(sp)  check that engine out real good, if it is a GEX or similar
knock 1,000 of the price, it'll cost you that much
&gt; 
&gt; oh yeah, if anyone knows of a 71-78 westy for sale in the Phoenix/Tucson
&gt; area, please let me know. I'll be looking aorund here for a couple more
&gt; days before i have to make a decision.

it might be better if you don't find something that &quot;catches&quot; your fancy
to fly back and try again elsewhere.  I know a westy that needs more work
in Maryland that is a lot cheaper.  only you know what you can handle or
want.

good luck
