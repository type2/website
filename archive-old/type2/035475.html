Subject: Insulation? Found it!

Hi Folks!
Sorry to take so long to find out about the insulation
info and for accidentally send an old message. I think
this is the same stuff I used in the airplane, if not
is very similar. Here we go; Is call black sound
proofing. Made of closed cell vinyl/nitrite insulating
material, it will not absorb water or oil. has fire
retardant qualities and is approve by the FAA. Use on
the inside cabin skins, sides, top and firewall.
Easily cuts with an electric knife to desired length.
It comes in 48&quot; wide and is black. (the one I used was
white) You can find it in 1/8&quot; to 1&quot; thick. prices
raging from 6.95 per foot X 48&quot; to 16.95. You can find
this product at Wag Aero Group in WI their # is
1-800-558-6868. Any way I will try to find exactly the
one I used and I post the info latter. I hope this
help!
Alex
