Subject: Steering Box Replacement

I found a rebuilt box for my '68 bus ($250), but so far have wasted 2
afternoons with 2 different pullers trying to remove the pitman arm. 
The nut was not very tight -- came right off.  I had started applying
Liquid Wrench 2 weeks ago thinking this would help loosen things up, but
no dice!

I remember a post (can't remember whose) recommending a chevy puller. Is
this worth the purchase for a probable one-time use, or should I break
down and take the job to my local VW mechanic?  Or is there another
approach I should attempt?

Thanks for any assistance, DC - Manhattan Beach, CA
