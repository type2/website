Subject: Need suggestions on a Full Bus Cover

------=_NextPart_000_05EC_01C1609A.0E056830
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello,

I've been off the list for a while now, but maybe someone can give me =
some
suggestions for a bus cover.  Last week my bus was broken into.  Luckily
they only got the cd player, but they tore up the dashboard and glove =
box in
the process.  Now I'm looking for a bus cover to help with security and =
for
weather (my bus is no longer my main vehicle and sits in the sun most of =
the
week).  Can anyone suggest a good place to find a full bus cover for a =
'71
Passenger bus?  Is there a certain kind that is better than another?  =
It's a
shame I have to resort to covering up her pretty paint job.  If you have =
any
suggestions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Dallas

P.S.  There is a bus near Duke University that has a nice cover on it, =
the
bus is a greenish-purple metalic colored passenger.  Is that person on =
the
list or does anyone know who it belongs to?
