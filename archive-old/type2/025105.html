 heres a tip for those of you replaceing cables because they broke at the 
 fitting at the heater box end. Go to an offroad store and get 'cable 
 shortning ' ends. They fit on your broken wire and you tighten them down 
with 
 a set screw. Beats the heck outa pulling the cable
 
 Chuck&gt;&gt;
Or for the super cheap you can bend a hook into the cable and hook it through 
the loop in a cotter key of an apropriate diameter, using the key as the new 
fitting.
