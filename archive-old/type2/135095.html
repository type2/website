Subject: Re: [T2] once upon a pre-owned tuna can

I saw a panel this morning, on my walk. Don't know the early bays well 
enough; it was somewhere between '68 and '71. Lots of bondo, faded 
paint, a window carved into one side, and a for sale sign. No price 
listed. I wished I'd had a sticker to put near the sign: &quot;Caution, 
whatever the asking price, this bus is going to end up costing between 
$4000 and $5000 before you can depend on it.&quot;

I think a lot of people buy buses because they think they can drive 
them to work and only occasionally do repairs. That is somewhat true of 
a '75 Volvo 240, but rarely true for a bus. Even the Volvo is going to 
need a new center bearing on the driveshaft, a waterpump, a steering 
pump, etc.

Once you've weeded through all of the wear issues on a bus (engine, 
suspension, cables, clutch, brakes, transmission, gas gauge sender, 
etc.), they are just as dependable as anything else. And probably 
cheaper, too. But even then, you have to keep to a maintenance schedule 
and carry a few spares -- clutch and throttle cables, points (or 
ideally a 2nd distributor, probably the 009 you took out of it, load 
with points and gapped).

If only we could get that message out to everyone who's looking at a 
sub-$1000 bus.
