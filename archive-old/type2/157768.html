Subject: Re: [T2]73 westy driving wine

it does sound tranny or final drive noise. does it sound different when
you turn a corner??
  no doesnt affect it in turns just it seems its louder when you put pressure on the tranny by steppin on the gas or going uphill...
  it whines louder... it will crusie nicely and sound ok at 50+ but it will whien agian if pressure is again put on uit at that speed for uphill etc..no bucking or nothing just whine.. almost reminds me of a power steering fluid low sound almost...?

is it constant with engine speed or road speed, ? its constant but quiet and loud depending on pressure applied to gas pedal..or a oncoming hill..?
  

does it change when you shift gears?? yes drastically its surely in there somewheres..?

is it lounder or more pronunced when you accelerate or decelerate or
drift? when you accelerate its louder by all means...it acts nice when you cruise or decelerate...

doees it change when you push the clutch in.. especially at speed 
  nope not at all..i thought the same thing...
  

sorry more queestions than answers
   
  hopefully i answered them ok...?
  thanks
  chai

Bob
