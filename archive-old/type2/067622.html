Subject: RE: Body/Paint Shop Recommendations in SF Bay Area?

&gt;Do any SF Bay area folks have recommentations for good body shops that
&gt;are VW-aware?

I have noticed a body shop in Scotts Valley that has a cherry splittie panel out
front, like it belongs to an employee.  Never checked it out though, but I've
always considered that it would be the first place to go when I finally get
around to  getting the work done on Sunshine.
