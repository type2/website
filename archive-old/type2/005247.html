Subject: Re: [T2] URGENT SOS

Mr. and Mrs. Dave Luppy are on their way.
They were towed to a second garage, one
that actually works on Bolts, and had the
broken halfshaft removed and brought it to
me for examination. We found the new inner cv
had come apart, and the cage was cracked
but not broken. The problem was the cv joint
had virtually no articulation, like as if it were
incorrectly assembled, but the fact is it is a
poor quality aftermarket part. it had also slightly
damaged the end of the shaft when the balls
dropped out, and the inner race was damaged.
We rejected the failed part and he is replacing
both halfshafts with good used, cleaned, greased,
original Lobro halfshafts, and should be good for
another million miles.He will be installing them
himself tomorrow morning.
Mrs. Luppy has examined her prenuptial agreement
and acknowledges that the party of the first part has
used up a significant portion of allowable roadside
repair time, but took the afternoon in stride, and was
quite interested in discussions of project vehicles and
technical ramblings.
They are heading for St. Louis and Seattle.
Happy Honeymoon, Dave and Dasha.
