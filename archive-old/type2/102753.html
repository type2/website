Subject: Re: [T2] 68 only?

From what I have learned about 68 busses:
The arms on the windshield wipers are unique. The gas tank does not a
a firewall.
I think the slider might be slightly different.
The door locks are very different, you have a modern type
pull push door lock.
More as I think of them.....

&gt;        I just purchased a 1968 SC. It is in great shape and my wife and I
&gt;love it . We have been split bus folks for quite some time and we are a bit
&gt;short on BAY knowledge.
