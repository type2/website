Subject: Re: effect of loose cut off valve?
Message-Id: &lt;199909301944.MAA02907_at_pdxss101.pdx.intel_dot_com&gt;

-&gt;The electric cut off valve on the left carb on my 1979 2l engine is very
-&gt;loose as the thread on the carburettor is gone. What effect may this have
-&gt;on the engine??


I believe it will cause an vacuum leak.  Those are bad by the way.

STORY TIME:

When I reinstalled the engine (1800 typeIV original carb setup) I used red
loctite on one of the solenoids that just wouldn't snug up.  Funny thing
being I cut the plunger off since it did not work, but wanted to plug that
hole.  

About a month ago we (that'd be the family: ma, pa, River (3yrs), and Ailim
(4 months)) went camping in the bus.  We have friends that live way back in
them thar hills.  Some rough roads to get there (and back).  When getting
ready to pull out I did the quick check, oil and all that.  I checked all
the solendoids, as I have the darndest time with those.  The one mentioned
previously was loose, way loose (did I drive all the way here like
that!!!).  I had no JB weld, and couldn't find anything to plug it up,
besides silicone and that would take to long to set.  So my friend likes to
sculpt, and I made a plug out of the red modeling clay and fit it in, and
all around, making sure not to stick it in so far that it would clog the
carb.  Praying that a small chunk wouldn't break off and clog a jet, we
drove home that way.  By the time we had gotten home the clay had dried and
cracked a bit.  I dug it all out and sealed it up with JBWeld.  I don't have
a probelm with dieseling, so I'm not worried about it.

Question for the group: does the shape of the plunger affect the way gas
flows past that space, i.e. does not having the plunger there cause any
problem?  I've heard someone grumbling about that, but didn't listen.  I see
no problems in operation, but theory is always neat.
