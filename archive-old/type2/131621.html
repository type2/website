Subject: Re: [T2] Previously windsheild installation, now Window Rubber

&gt;From: &quot;Jeff Stewart&quot; &lt;

&gt;I've done this more times than I care to think about. I've never used soap,
&gt;but have always used powder to help the seal slide in place. It helps to do 
&gt;it
&gt;on a warm day when the seal is soft from sitting in the sun. My wife is
&gt;(reluctantly) my helper for doing windshields/glass. She is on the inside 
&gt;of
&gt;the bus pulling the cord while I'm on the outside pushing on the glass. As 
&gt;you
&gt;get the windshield about 3/4 way seated it does get pretty hard pulling the
&gt;cord out-this is when we switch,and I start pulling the cord and she pushes 
&gt;on
&gt;the glass.


Is there a certain orientation of the rubber? IOW, where should the &quot;Seam&quot; 
where the rubber is joined supposed to be located? I seem to remember a 
thread about this and can't find it. Anybody out there have a clue on this 
one?
