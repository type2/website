Boy, it sure would be easier to explain this with a picture...

Does the term 'polar moment of inertia' mean anything to you?  By moving the
wheel in relation to the bearings you are changing it's moment.  ie: the
lever that is acting on the bearings.  Assume that the stock wheel is
centered between the inner and outer bearings.  The load is carried equally
by each bearing.  Move the wheel either way (but lets assume out for the
sake of discussion.)  You now have a greater portion of the load being
carried by the outer bearing.  Using a spacer to move it moves its
'moment'.  The point about which it axially rotates.  Translated through the
longer studs.  Might be that there's a physics expert on the list that can
better explain it. (Or correct me if I'm in error...)

&gt;
&gt;  Dunno about the exact measurements but can you explain why the
&gt; spacers are so bad, when their role is to correct the offset?
&gt;  I can see that spacers will increase the strain on the studs
&gt; themselves, as they will have to hold the assmbly together, but
&gt; surely once the assembly is, er, assembled the offset will be
&gt; correct, the wheel will be centred on the bearings and all will
&gt; be well in the world?
&gt;  The leverage exerted on the bearings by the lateral (cornering)
&gt; forces on the bottom of the tyre will be related to tyre diameter
&gt; rather than wheel depth, yes?
&gt;  Is there another wear mechanism I'm missing?
&gt;
&gt;  (I am aware that there will be secondary effects caused by using
&gt;   wider tyres, lower profiles etc. but I don't think that's caused
&gt;   by the use of spacers).
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;         W.
