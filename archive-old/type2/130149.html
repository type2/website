Okay, can anyone verify that he's got cheap chrome tin? I'm thinking
that it may be OEM, but has been painted silver.

Does anyone have pictures of the doghouse side of the tin to show him.

If it is in fact cheap tin, he needs to install factory (OEM - Original
Equipment Manufacturer) tin. Take that non-factory chrome tin off and
crush it so it would fall into the hands of some poor unsuspecting
person. If it is cheap tin, I bet it won't even have the proper internal
vanes to direct the air properly.

The OEM tin has all the necessary turning vanes that helps to direct the
air. See if there are any shops that work on aircooleds around you. They
sometimes have piles of old engines that you could scavenge. You might
even find a block that in good enough shape to start building your spare
engine.

That oil cooler makes me nervous. I wonder how its plumbed? I wonder if
the factory oil cooler was removed? If it was removed, I'm betting that
the air balance is all wrong and some cylinders are probably starved for
air.

Since you're pulling the motor anyway -- repaint all the tin black.
Silver/chrome tends to reflect radiant heat -- whether it does so
enough to actually raise engine temps is a religious war that should
probably not be discussed.

OEM tin would cool MUCH better no matter what color it is but I with
you. Get rid of the chrome.
