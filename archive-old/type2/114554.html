Subject: RE: [T2] Rimco - good heads, bad studs

&gt;Have you cheched NAPA or your local FLAPS.
&gt;I think NAPA(or at least mine does) has these or something very close.

I checked Pep Boys and Advance Auto here in Colorado Springs and both places
recommended me to Home Depot.  Home Depot said, &quot;Studs?  They're in the
lumber department.&quot;  So I looked anyway and they didn't have anything
remotely resembling a head stud :(

Also checked with Pelican Parts (Porsche aftermarket distributor) and they
don't have them either.
