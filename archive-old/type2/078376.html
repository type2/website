Both these vehicles are in Germany.  As I see a lot of interest in the double 
cab, I would say that purchase price and shipping to the states are less than 
most of you would pay for the like vehicle down the road from &quot;hometown 
anywhere USA.&quot;  Only serious inquiries need email as time is as precious as 
the cargo you'd be hauling if you'd bought this vehicle.
Increase the Peace
