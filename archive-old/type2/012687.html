Subject: horn &amp; other elec. problems
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hi list,

I've encountered a few electrical problems with my
'75.  First off, does anyone know which wire from the
steering column controls the horn.  The Muir book only
has a paragraph on horns and doesn't go into too much
detail about it.  I've done pretty well with yelling
and shaking my fist but a horn would be nice.

Second, I seem to have an inverted brake warning
light.  It comes on when I drive and then goes off
when I brake.  This just started a few days ago and I
had my brakes done a month ago, so I figure it must be
electrical.

That's it for now,

Have a great day,

Tesa
