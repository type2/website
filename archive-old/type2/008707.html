Subject: Rear brake work cont'd...

Howdy volks,      Getting back to you all on my rear wheel brake shoe
replacement &gt; bearings pack &gt; CV pack.   I haven't yet gotten the rear
axle and CV joints off......don't have the proper 8mm 12-point tool yet
(correct?) for removing CV bolts.  Archives talk a lot about stripping
the bolts, etc.  Should I clean the heck out of them....._dot_degrease or ? 
I picked up an 8mm 12-point tool that has no socket, but I
think the one with socket attached would be better wouldn't it?  I don't
think I'd get the correct torque reading with this setup when
installing...
          On another note........I'm being told that to get at the wheel
bearings from the inside I must remove the CV joints and
axle........(never done anything like this).  Do I just set that critter
down on the floor after removal?   Bentley talks about a 20 degree tilt
causing ball bearings to come rolling out.  I don't want that to happen
particularly.  It they get out my garage door, they're probably headed
for the creek!  Ahh!  
          To make a long list of questions short:

         1:  Are the CV bolts liable to strip....how to prevent? (oz. of
prev. worth lb. of cure)
         2:  Just remove the CV bolts then lay that critter on floor?
Grease the CVs while I'm in there?
         3:  Do I need a 2 armed pulley to remove the wheel axle?  Can I
drive it back in with a block of wood and a hammer, or preferred method??


           
              Helplessly hoping,      Kevin  Snow
