&gt; I'm in the process of changing some push rod seals on my '72 Westy with a

&gt; you could pass along to me for getting them out (I'm a woman so pure
&gt; strength won't work!)? I'd rather not have to go out and purchase a special
&gt; tool for this either. I'd like to get this job done so I can enjoy the rest
&gt; of the weekend! 

the trick I use for sticky tubes is simplicity itself.

use a pair of gas pliers (these are the standard type in everyones
toolbox) open em to the larger setting and grab the tubes with the round
part of the pliers all the way at the base near the case, in fact have
them touching the case and grip firmly but gently, wrap a rag around the
tube to protect it too if you want (I use the rubber jar openers)

tilt the pliers towards the center of the engine and the tube should pop
out
