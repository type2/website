Subject: Just theoretically there is this motor..

Ok so there is this poor dude with this flat four motor see and he's worried
as...

Got over hot (motor did too) about a 1000k ago, dealt with that ok 
a few hundred k's later the oil light takes several seconds to go out
at first start up each day and slight knocking noises until it does.
Then after another few hundred K's a vibration starts which is related
to engine speed almost like a harmonic phazing in and out almost musically
in two rev ranges.(Nasty feeling in guts of driver)
Now the symphony is becoming so obvious the SO can feel and hear it all.
Still drives well otherwise, of course treating with extreme care as this
is our only vehicle and were are remote.(Sob, sniffle..)
My guess is a big end or main bearing going, going, ....
Any confirmation sort of welcome.
Thanks Doi
