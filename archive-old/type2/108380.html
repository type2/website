Subject: 70 Westy for Sale $2000 obo

Listees,
    Unfortunately my circumstances have changed and I am unable to care for
my 70 Westy any longer. I am seeking a good home for her.
    I had been driving her daily until about a month ago when I found out
she had a small crack in the block. She leaks about a quart of oil every
1,000 miles. Not much for most people, however, I was putting 3 to 4
thousand miles a month on her due to work.
    She still runs strong and I had intended to restore her, but family,
bills, etc have taken priority, and I don't want to just leave her in the
driveway to rust and dry rot.
    Her tent is in A-1 shape, I have the childs cot. The sink and cabinet
are out and need some work, but I have them also. She has the proper size
tires with lots of tread. The bed works fine and the upper cot needs new
material.
    The body is in fair to good condition. There is a large dent in the
nose. There is some rust, but not too much. The interior is still the
bandanna material put in by Jamie Auch.
    I am asking $2000, but am negotiable. I stay in Hampstead, NC b/n
Jacksonville and Wilmington.
    I will get some pics online soon. P-mail me if interested.
Later,
Jim
Hampstead, NC
