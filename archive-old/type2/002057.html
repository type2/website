Subject: Re: Magnetic Oil Drain Plug OK?

&gt;    Be careful with these -- I put one in a Type 1 engine and trashed a
&gt;new rebuild -- turns out that the magnetic part was too long, it pushed
&gt;the strainer plate right up tight against the mouth of the oil pickup
&gt;tube, and since I hadn't hooked up the wire from the oil pressure sender


As the origional question was for use in a T4 I note, this is not an issue
in the T4 case, a magnetic plug used in the drain plug hole (as you have to
as the strainer nut is special) has all the clearance in the world, at least
2 inches.  As Harmon unfortunately notes this is not at all the case in the
T1.
