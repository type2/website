Subject: Re: [T2] re-refined oil

Lou Bob Oil Co.

Yep--back in the 60's when I deliverd pizza's in my 58 DelRay
couple--235 three on the tree--oil belching beater---this is all I used.
Re-refined oil.

I think it was $3.00 bucks a two gallon can--a bargain.

Clark Oil Co, here in the Windy used to sell re-refined low buck oil for
us kids too.

I don't think it was the best of the best---
As fast as ya dumped in one end-it came out the other--- ~ 8 )-
