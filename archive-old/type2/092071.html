Subject: Re: [T2] hub caps

Sound about right,, When I was learning about tires, I weighed my 74 Deluxe
Westfalia, and it was 3950lbs empty.. with about 1/2 tank of gas,

So,, I figure, add:
Wife blah blah Blah! pounds
Me at 200 pounds,
3 kids add up to 300 pounds 
our 700 pounds of gear,, and you end up with about 5350 lbs... and if you do the
math,, i added 50 lbs for the gas!

&gt; My ASI goes across the scales right at 4900 loaded for the weekend.
&gt; Probably 750 of that is gear and people and dog.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone asked the weight of a westy saturday ( I deleted the email, oops).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, my 72 weighs 3100 lbs + or - 20 lbs as indicated by the certification
&gt; &gt; issued by the state of Colorado.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yours is light compared to my 77 deluxe Westy.
&gt; &gt; Curb weight [without me in it] is 3820 lbs.
