Leo, if you get no other responses, I think I have another wheel in my
stash. You'd need to check part number from on line..or from list
gurus...as, I think, they are not an across-the-board fit. This one may have
beeen from a 70...but maybe not :(   IF it's a match..you could have it for
shipping cost.
