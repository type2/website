ok...you all remember me hooking up that toggle switch because my
ignition switch if fried...right?
I won't fix the ignitions switch for lack of knowledge, and
coolness....an extra switch on my dash just looks cool.
anyways....with my muffler completely off....haha! the neighbors were
mad!  I hooked up my switch.... it is a lighted 2-position toggle
switch. on and off.  Ok, its all wired in right... I put my key in and
go to start my bus....battery is dead! hmmmm?? why is this.... so I
charged up the battery and proceeded to start the bus.  I flipped the
toggle switch on (so the light was on) and tried to start  my bus....no
go.... its just like before when my ignition switch was fried.  it just
cranks the starter.  so I try to start my bus with the toggle switch off
(so the light is off)  she fires right up!  (and very very loudly might
I add! - no muffler..its in the mail)  then I take the key out and
notice that my oil light is still on....and the toggle switch light is
out....hmmm....it still is reading how much gas is in the tank too  -
like the key was in the &quot;on&quot; position, but the bus isn't running....then
I flip the switch so the switch's light is on.... everything goes out
like they key was out of the ignition....except the toggle switch's
light is still on....either way draining my battery!
So I unhooked it, sent my friend for cigarettes, and came in here to
type to you....
the switch has 3 connections - ground, accessory, and power.
the ground is to the ground, the accessory is to the + side of the coil,
and the power side is to the - side of the battery....
whats happening?? should I just unhook the ground so that the little LED
light doesn't light up??
help!
thanks list!
