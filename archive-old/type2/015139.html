Subject: where can I list my bus?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey folks, 
I don't want to waste anyone's valuable time with ads that you're not all
interested in. Can someone direct me to a good site for listing my '77
Adventure-Wagen.  
Parting with it is painful enough; hopefully there's a painless way to
advertise.
Thanks,
