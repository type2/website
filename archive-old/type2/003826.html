Hay all
Ok my turn, I need some help here in regards to a gas heater, I want to put
one in my double cab before the winter. Anyone here put one in one of
these?
I was thinking I could mount the unit under the rear seat but then I would
need to route the hose through seat pedestal, which I don't really want to
cut up. Is there another way to do this? any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Shawn
