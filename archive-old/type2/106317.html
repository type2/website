Peace Brother,

Snoopy &gt;&gt;

From another list...Morgan (The ultimate 'tea-bagger' sports car), was
almost legislated out of the US in the early 70's; Isis Motors, in SF, 
turned to propane to power the engines to get them under the regs
until the factory (actually Land Rover, who produced the engines)
could get the necessary compliance on the gas engines...The re-
sults on the propane powered cars is almost all positive. The cost
per mile is similar to the gas powered cars, with the only drawback
being fillups...Long distances require a map with stations that carry
propane. The upside is the engine runs a lot cleaner, both internally
and at the tailpipe...
