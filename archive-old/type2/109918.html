&lt;&lt; Spent quite a few years in the Navy. First 2 playing Boatswain Mate till 
I changed rates. My first ship was considered a Flag ship with all the 
fancy  military ceremonial decorations. We used to mix about 6 ounces of 
spar varnish with the a gallon of haze gray, deck gray, or boot topping 
for the nonskid. Left a permanent fresh waxed look and seemed to stand 
up to the salt air better than straight enamel. I wonder who the 
manufacture of that paint was? It would probably last forever on a bus 
here in the arid climate of Arizona.

It's not &quot;just&quot; the paint...Almost any industrial type paint will meet
&quot;mil. spec&quot; (the brand name manufacturers don't want to be left
out.) It's the drying time that's the problem. You need a dust-free
room to use slow drying oil enamels. (Trivia question: Why WERE
Model T's black ?-)
