Subject: Distributors and total advance

Alrighty then.

After reading all of the wonderful musings on distributors
and what their total advance should be for various engines,
I sat down and confirmed what I thought I remembered:

at full advance (3500-3600 RPM), the engine is advanced to
49 deg (+/- 1 deg) BTDC.  This is on a 1971 bus, 1600DP
with a rebuit dual vacuum advance dizzy.

Doh!

Perhaps this is why my engine has been running hotter than I'd
like?  I have my timing set to 5 deg ATDC at 850 rpm, with the
vacuum hoses hooked up and the engine warmed up...

And I had thought that the dual vacuum advance just had more total
advance than the 009...

Thoughts?
