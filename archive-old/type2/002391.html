Subject: New engine &amp; damn F.A.R.T's

Ok, so I expected a rust bucket of a bug for free with a rough 1600dp in the
back. I mean, when your given a car with a title (log book here in the UK)
you don't expect much. Well I picked it up this morning &amp; was shocked to
find a clean 1303S with a sound 1600dp (70mph+ no probs!) Brand new EMPI 4
stud alloys &amp; tyres (yes tyres, for us limeys).
Well I was going to tear this engine down for the case, after my bug case
fiasco last month. Seems too great a crime &amp; as I don't need any other
parts, the cars going to &quot;Terry's VW&quot; in exchange for removing the engine
for me (he insists on giving me something in addition, but I'll hold a
favour instead I think!). Since the engine has no endfloat probs &amp; 140 PSI,
it's also a crime to trash this engine for the case. So the lumps going to
Garp after his recent checkers piece crisis &amp; I'll take his shagged engine
for the case. Every-one goes home happy!

On a some what sadder note, what the hell was going on with the Tyre FART?
The archives are FULL of this, if it's rated correctly &amp; you like the price
fine. By all means post a 1 liner on your good find, but when most of the
replies have quoted ALL the first message or even the original &amp; one of the
replies, it gets a bit much. I consider these messages _at_ the same level as
commercial SPAM. I think marks reply was a GOOD example of a reply, just a
couple of seconds formatting will keep dander's _at_ bay &gt;:-(

&lt;RANT MODE = OFF&gt;
