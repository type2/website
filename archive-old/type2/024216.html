Subject: Glidden (parts 1 &amp; 2)
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Gentlepersons-
                       Came across a couple of gallons of Glidden two part 
zinc 
chromate epoxy primer. Anybody familiar with the results of this stuff?
Anybody ever use it? NOS from a house sale, and the price was right, so
I picked it up...A local Glidden dealer swears it'll last forever, prevent 
rust AND fetch my slippers...
