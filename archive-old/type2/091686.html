Subject: Re: [T2] Imported Mexican Beetles?

Not too bad price wise---
For a brand new Brazillian Van---about $11,000.00 
A people carrier about 15,000.00
And for a Dormobile type camper about 18,000.00.
&quot;Independant heating system, and 3 year warrantee as standard&quot;
These thnigs must be able to be imported from the UK---


Later,

Terry

Didn't they quit making the new vintage style Beetles thus drying up the
supply of car bodies for these folks? 
We've got one new &quot;vintage&quot; Beetle here in town and it is very nice
looking. Gets cared for well, lives in a garage. Chris M. &lt;&quot;Busbodger&quot;
