well as to the rpm...i checked mine this morning coming home from work...it
showed 4100rpm at 70 mph......as to speedo error you might be right on
that.....hmmmmm 

i looked in a catalog yesterday and the rev limiter showed a 5400 rpm
cutoff.....maybe they also have 4400 ones.....

and your third point...i know what you mean about the carbs choking your
engine......what are you using on the bus now??  mine are stock solex 32
duals.....stock air cleaners and all......would like to upgrade to a larger
size also but my bus is a daily driver from the coldest winters thru the
summer.  and need to keep some carb preheat thru the aircleaner assembly for
winter driving.......wish someone had a setup that did this on any size carbs
used.  i noticed a major reduction in gas mileage without using the preheat
hoses.  gas mileage now is never below 18mpg and it is always checked every
fillup....and that is all in town driving.   all my summer trips last year
netted me ( up to ) a 25-26 mpg.  how about you ??  does this compare to your
van at all??
