Subject: RE: [T2] Re: split conversion?

--Here on Long Island there is a fella that took the body off his splittie
and put it on the chassis of a Toyota van.......
--I think I saw that guy at the High Country Bus Festival. A vehicle that
definitely makes one stop and look.

--Are you thinking of the Roadcow? It has a toyota engine but it is all VW
chassiswise.



Nope, this guy had a splittie that was rotten from the floors down, so he
cut the front and the top off and grafted it on to a modern minivan.  

It was a little like the Texas Chainsaw massacre where the killers were
wearing the skinned faces of their victims. I wish I had taken a picture of
the front interior. The splitty dashboard just stopped and the modern van
started. I found a picture of the exterior

I'm familiar with the roadcow. I personally have a 69 with a Corvair 2.7
liter flat 6 and tranny. At least I kept it aircooled.
