Well, I ran Suegro down to VW Bus Heaven yesterday. The folks down there are
great, with plenty of knowledge to go around.

I was looking (I thought) for the steering column bracket for Suegro, a '69
Westy (I thought) hardtop.

Bill had pulled a bracket and steering column for me, and when I arrived, I
took it out to match against the bottom of the dash. The one already in
there doesn't match the holes in the bottom of the dash. But lo and behold,
the bracket Bill offered was identical to the one I already had. It seems
the bracket wasn't the problem. It's the dash. At some point, someone
swapped out the dash for a newer one. So now I'm in search of a dash for a
'69.

Also, Bill took a look around at the interior, and let me know that he was
pretty sure that Suegro was not really a Westy. It seems the AC connection
to the outside is in the wrong place (too far back), and the only remaining
cabinet, the base of the bed is the wrong color. Too dark. It does have a
Westfalia plate riveted to it, so I'm confused. In addition, the door to
this cabinet is hinged at the top (not the bottom), and is bigger than the
hole in the face of the cabinet, rather than smaller with a rubber seal (no
seal on mine).

So, the questions begin:

1. Anyone have a lead on a '69 dash?

2. Any guesses as to how this bus was configured when it comes to interior?
The hole in the floor for the sink is circular, not oval or oblong.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
