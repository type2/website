Subject: Re: [T2] brake drum won't come off 

&gt; I removed the two nuts from the drum as suggested by the list (I can't
&gt; believe I didn't know that). But now the stupid thing won't slide off. I can 
&gt; wigle it a little and see that it is kinda loose, but thats it. How do I get 
&gt; it off, can it be sticking on the thing behind the axle nut? I hope to have 
&gt; this apart before 5 so I can run to vw store in town and get the parts.
