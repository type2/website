X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Rob,
My web page has an FI section which focuses on the description of how all
the components work together, which should give you the basic understanding
of the system that you need.

Once you've got that, the Bentley and Haynes service manuals give excellent
troubleshooting instructions and procedures for using your VOM to
troubleshoot the system.  I felt no need to reprint that since those manuals
are cheap and widely available, and you should never work on a Bus without
one :-)

There is also a great webpage out there which is a scanned copy of a VW FI
troubleshooting manual, which actually has diagnostic flow charts to guide
you through the correct procedures.  That address is
http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/ (and it's also linked from my
page).

Sami Dakhlia also has a copy of that manual online, but I don't know the web
address.  Sami?

My page is at http://www.type2_dot_com/~bartnik and all the FI stuff is in the
VW Technical Articles section.

There is also a great book out there which you should get, as it helps very
much with the understanding of the system.  It's called &quot;How to Understand,
Service and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management&quot; by Charles O.
Probst, and it's published by Bentley.  You should be able to find it in
most bookstores or you can order directly from Bentley _at_ www.rb_dot_com -- other
vendors like Bus Depot (www.busdepot_dot_com) will probably also have it at
reduced cost.  This book really helped me understand what was going on.

Hope this helps,

&gt; I know I should study more on how to troubleshoot my
&gt; FI 80 Westy.  I'd like to get to the point where I
&gt; understood and could check major parts using no more
&gt; than a volt ohm meter.  Does Sean have a web page with
&gt; this info?
&gt;
