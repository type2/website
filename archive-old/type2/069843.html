&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the page listing (I located you through Lycos).
&gt; 
&gt; I learned to drive in a 1966 deluxe and have wanted to own one since my
&gt; parents sold the bus in 1972.
&gt; 
&gt; There are so many memories of that bus, such as the trip from Eugene OR
&gt; to Dunlap IA with my folks, back in 1969.  We traveled thru miles of oil
&gt; derricks on the way... but not a gas station open for 200 miles.  When we
&gt; ran to the &quot;reserve&quot;, we pulled over to gas stations in hopes to find a
&gt; few ounces of gas in the nozzle of a station (this was just after the sun
&gt; came up, sometime around 6 AM).  The station owner had left a 5 gallon
&gt; can of gas in case someone ran out.  We left the station happy... and
&gt; left him a note and $10 for the gas (gas was a lot cheaper then, but we
&gt; were very grateful)... and enough gas to drive on to other stations that
&gt; were open.
&gt; 
&gt; After we reached my grandparents' house, dad decided to drive on into
&gt; Detroit to visit a relative there.  On the way he picked up a hitchhiker
&gt; (and, as per usual, he bought a meal for the guy when he stopped for
&gt; breakfast).  A few hours later, the bus started losing power (dad never
&gt; liked that bus because he didn't know how to work on it... it was a
&gt; &quot;thing&quot; that mom and I had for the bus that kept it around &lt;grin&gt;).  He
&gt; would drive down the hills, getting up to about 35.  On the next uphill
&gt; stretch, they'd plod along on the shoulder until they got down to walking
&gt; speed.  The hitchhiker would jump out and help push the bus to the top of
&gt; the next hill.  They finally reached a large town (small city), and dad
&gt; found the local VW expert just off the first ramp.
&gt; 
&gt; He stayed up at a hotel overnight, waiting results of the examination by
&gt; the garage.  Finally, with the engine apart on the bench, they found that
&gt; every part was damaged except the case.  They could rebuild the engine
&gt; from parts, or could order a new engine from Detroit.  There was about
&gt; $50 difference in price, but it'd take 3 days for the engine to arrive.
&gt; 
&gt; So, with 45K on the bus, it had the engine rebuilt.  Previous, the bus
&gt; would do 70 flat out... but only 65 after the rebuild... and pedal down
&gt; was the way the bus was always driven on the freeway.
&gt; 
&gt; I attribute the engine failure to 2 things.  Obviously, cylinder 3 had
&gt; dropped a valve, and it was only a miracle that it didn't totally destroy
&gt; the engine.  It was mid-summer and temperatures were 100+, not a good
&gt; time to be driving the bus flat-out, and we should have had the valves
&gt; adjusted before attempting a cross-country trek.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a bus of my own, and would LOVE to lay my hands on a 65
&gt; or 66 deluxe (green).  As a concession to its &quot;frailities&quot;, I'm
&gt; considering on putting in a cylinder and oil temp guage... and possibly
&gt; relocating the oil cooler (although another part of me wants a bone-stock
&gt; VW).  BTW, while dad thought it was a 66 bus, I still believe it was a
&gt; 65.  I bought the parts for the bus, and worked from chasis and engine
&gt; numbers, which identified it as such.  I still think that it was a 65,
&gt; but that he bought it in 66 (there wasn't a big difference between the
&gt; models, but I'm sure the title also said 65).
&gt; 
&gt; Any way, thanks again.  There are other stories, of course... such as the
&gt; time we took to the logging roads, with friends &quot;hanging&quot; out the sun
&gt; roof, and such.  I'm looking forward to doing some traveling, and a VW
&gt; seems such a &quot;cool&quot; way to get there.
&gt; 
&gt; As a forward, I did have a 60 beetle, complete with a true reserve tank.
&gt;  Before I could figure out where all the gas was going (it only got
&gt; around 10 MPG), it was wrecked by my sister (I was in the Army at the
&gt; time).
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be seeing your page again soon...
