Subject: The MicroBus is out! Guess who has one. Color a bit of a
  problem...

	Volks,
	Add watching the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon more than
I might otherwise to the advantages of parenthood :) I saw an
ad two nights ago featuring the new VW MicroBus. Yes, Barbie's
VW MicroBus has just been released! Two-tone pink and pale
magenta. Is this halo-effect from the New Beetle? Has VW
figured out a marketing path that elluded ChryCorp? (very likely).

Anyway, looks a lot like the concept- neo-barndoorish engine
cover comes way down low carrying belt-line down to radiator grille.
Frankly I think Ben Pon would be apalled- the styling is far
too forced, but I think the first facelift will clean it up
a great deal.

(C'mon Bill, you're talking about a TOY, not the actual vehicle :) )
