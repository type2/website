Subject: Re: [T2] value of stock '74 dual carbs and full exhaust (??on the exh.)

[...]

The heater boxes will fit 72 to 78.
The 411 muffler will fit on the 72 to 74 heater boxes BUT the flange is a
different size for the EGR filter. If you use it on a 75 to 78 with EGR, you
cannot bolt on the filter. The 2 studs are closer together.
To use the 72-74 boxes on a 75 and up, you will need additional pieces from
the 72-74 engine:
the alternator adjusting support,
both pipes that go between the flapper valves and heater boxes,
both front lower cylinder tin,
both lower pushrod tin.
both heater pipes that go thru the upper tin from the blower fan.

As far as a value on the carbs..... I have seen them sell for next to nothing
on ebarf. This annoys me because I can't buy them from self-serve yards for
less than $60-$75 complete with manifolds, tubing, and linkage. Add the
aircleaner and it is up to $75-$90. But they are used and kind of unknown as
far as how worn out they are on the shafts.

&gt; I would like to know the value of the used dual solexes for the 74 van I am
&gt; parting- ran OK as PO drove it from Va to Pa but it has too much rust.  The
&gt; engine was dismantled by him; also have  full exhaust, decent heater boxes
&gt; (German) and the Muffler, with original grey paint, has a VW symbol, made in
&gt; germany, and brand name of something like Leitztritz, with a notation of for
&gt; 411/412 - does this mean the 411 muffler fit this bus?  The manifold is
&gt; combined with the heater boxes, which have a wierd combined dual outlet on
&gt; each side with no crossover stuff.
&gt; I assume this would fit the 75 bus as it has oval head exhaust port gaskets?
