Subject: Oil Strainer (Gasket?) Question.

Hey hey, I got this small leak under my engine, I believe it's coming
from my oil strainer. I went to napa to get the gaskets, no prob. But I
can't get the oil strainer cover off. So I want to make sure I'm prying
at the RIGHT part before I pry TOO hard. :) '76 2.0L FI btw. 
 
The thing I THINK is the oil strainer, is in just about dead center of
the bottom of the engine, right along the seam. It's roughly 6&quot; from
side to side, maybe a tad less, and has ONE bolt in the center of it. I
took out that bolt, but the plate (if it's really a plate) won't budge
and I can't find where the plate mates up with the case. Witch is why
I'm wondering if that's a plate, or if it's just part of the case. If
that IS it, any hints/tricks on how to get it off? Will brute force
warp/bend it? 
 
The gasket set came with 2 paper'ish gaskets, and one metal ring. I'm
guessing the metal ring goes around the bolt as either a spacer or a
seal, and the one gasket goes on either side of the strainer. And the
OTHER place that I'm thinking COULD be the strainer, is up towards the
engine hatch. But that plate has 2 bolts, and since I only got ONE metal
ring, I'm assuming that's the wrong place. 
 
Oi, silly questions I know. :)
