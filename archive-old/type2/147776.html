Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Air Conditioning

Dave, you mention the rotary compressor conversion. I have a
semi-functioning under-dash a/c unit in my '79... Does the compressor bolt
up in the same area as that for an overhead system? And How difficult is it
to convert to a rotar compressor? Where did you source yours (what's VPC?)?
Thanks-

JJ

&gt; Peter,
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure that removing it would ruin the &quot;stock&quot; appeal...but a
&gt; functioning a/c in a bus has a certain appeal to some folks....who might
&gt; be willing to pay extra for it.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 78 Champagne Edition with a fully functional overhead A/C
&gt; unit...with a rotary compressor change over....all *under* the stock tin
&gt; to avoid heat problems.
&gt;
&gt; The A/C unit was brand new out of the orignal VPC box last year....I heard
&gt; that they still have plenty of them....originally for 68-72 so you have to
&gt; come up with your own compressor mount for the late model t4 engine.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
