&gt;I guess the question is ... does it reduce power enough that it's not

&gt;displacement is a non-starter.

Not many hills around here, but I see your point.  I am not sure that peak 
hp would be reduced that much with the stock carbs - a loss of torque is 
inevitable though.  That's the biggest negative in my book.

&gt;I have pretty much decided to install a CDI.

Me too, eventually.

&gt;...and it seems a lot easier than trying to make a non-standard engine
&gt;configuration work :-)

But stock is so... boring!
