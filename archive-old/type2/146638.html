Subject: Re: [T2] valves

&gt;i dont think there is much weight difference between the stock steel
&gt;pulley and the aluminum degree pulleys.
&gt;especially compared to the weight of the flywheel.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
I agree - I have just switched (today) an aluminium one for a stock 
steel pulley wheel and took the opportunity to weigh them. The Aluminium 
one was 4 grams *heavier* than the steel one.
