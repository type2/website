&gt; &gt; 74 through 79 Westfalia tops are all the same.

It is true that the Riviera tops are different than the Westfalia tops --
however, I believe this is a case of apples and oranges because these are
two totally different camper conversions -- Riviera tops were not put onto
Westfalia campers, and vice versa.  Therefore, if you have a Riviera top,
you don't have a Westfalia (unless the top was replaced later or
something).  I will often see a Riviera for sale that the owner mistakenly
identifies as a &quot;Westy&quot; on the sign or in the paper...
