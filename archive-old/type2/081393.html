Subject: hydraulic lifter question

I am currently deciding which engine configuration to get for my 73 bus. =
I have decided to use AVP as the rebuilder.
I am currently leaning toward the 1800cc engine,  but don't know how to =
decide on the hydraulic v. solid lifter question. I have a Weber =
progressive carb which my engine installer is going to rejet for the new =
engine and a Mallory distributor. Everything else (trans, clutch) is =
stock and in good working order.
Any suggestions on the lifter question?
TIA,

Tom Adams
