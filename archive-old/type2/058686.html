The helicoil makers will tell you that helicoils are stronger than the
original threads.  That's probably true, but they still have the problem of
coming out at inopportune times.  You are right to worry about them,
although the exhaust stud threads are not as critical as spark plug threads
since you have eight of them.   Helicoils will probably work okay if you
don't remove the exhaust very often.  Did you know that all 72-74 type IV
engines have helicoils in the fuel pump mounting bolt holes?  At least
every one I have ever seen has had them.  I guess the factory put them in
there.  Why, I have no clue.

&gt;Nobody in town seems to have timesert repair in 9 mm and the only hope of
&gt;helicoil in that size is Pep Boys which I will check tonight.

I got stepped studs from VW in 9/8 mm.  I may even have a couple lying
around still.  I don't like using the 9mm ones because it's an oddball size
and not much bigger than the original, so the new threads may not be very
deep.  In the past I have had good result with 10/8 mm stepped studs.  I
got mine in the San Diego area at a VW FLAPS - Harloff Import parts in La
Mesa.  I would think they wouldn't be THAT hard to find if you look around.
It will be difficult to strip the 10mm threads - they are big.  Loctite the
studs in there and use anti-sieze on the nuts.
