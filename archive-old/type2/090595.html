Subject: Re: [T2] VWofA hassle;  new aftermarket crankshaft pulley

I'm thinking that adding an oil cooler and doing the Type IV rod notch
trick might net you lower engine temperatures. A little tougher than just
installing a crank pulley but overall a positive way to get results.

&gt; I think that Berg was right for the wrong reasons.  Above a certain 
&gt; RPM I
&gt; think that the flow through the cylinders and cooler is choked and 
&gt; will
&gt; not increase no matter how much faster you spin the fan.  I also 
&gt; wonder
&gt; how you get a larger crank pulley into the pulley tin.
