I've had awsome luck with my MOFOCO rebuilt 1700 w/ twin weber carbs.  I have
about 3500 mi on it so far, and it is nice and strong.

 &gt; Hey, no problem. Basically, what I said was to avoid GEX, MOFOCO, and
 Fast
 &gt; German Auto. I've heard good things about Mark Stepens, SIR, and Bob
 Donalds.
 &gt; Bob is located in Boston, Mass., and can be reached through the LiMBO web
 &gt; site.
 &gt;  You might also try getting one through Ron at the Bus Depot, he is
 located in
 &gt; PA., which is better than dealing with a company in CA. Also, as for core
 &gt; charges on engines from the mail order places, it'll cost almost as much
 as
 &gt; the core charge to
 &gt; ship it to CA, then they'll say your block was'nt rebuildable, so no
 refund.
 &gt; How do you know they did'nt rebuild it and sell it to the next guy? You
 don't.
 &gt; Hope this was of some help.     Jeff
