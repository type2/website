Okay!!!!

  The *good* news is that Ramona went to work with Mom for the first time in 7
months yesterday and felt like the old, true, happy dream she used to!
  After having done my FIRST (yay!) valve adj. last Sunday, when I got to work
I realized I shoulda gone ahead and switched out the valve cover gaskets 'cos
she was a-drippin' and smokin' off the heat exchangers. So! On my lunch; down
to Small Car World (we love that joint) and gottum some fresh gaskets,
switched out, started up, right as rain! No more leaks.
  After work I went to dinner with friends in Berkeley and spent a good deal
of the time looking forward to the ride home : )
  Alas. Got home and 'Mona's butt was all Smokey. My fear (and inkling) is
that the oil cooler is kaput. Not much in the way of oil hitting the ground
(no more than usual), but I'd noticed a slight line of oil dripping down that
cursed left side earlier in the day and have already decided it's the cooler.
  Question: What else could it be? Remember; Ramona's been at rest for some
time. Is there anything else that could cause the smokey-a#s syndrome? I have
never yanked her engine on my own and I'm not looking all that forward to it,
so it'd be so extra cool if it were something easier.
  Anyway, any suggestive possibilities would be dearly appreciated. If it *is*
the oil cooler (which was replaced less than a year ago_at_#$*!), I'm also kinda
wondering if any of you all live near by and might feel like helping out a
rookie on an engine pull. I know it's a lot to ask, but there's beer and BBQ
in it for you and you sure would be helping out me an' ole 'Mona girl.
  Note: I haven't changed the oil yet, and I need to replace the wire on the
oil sensor 'cos it's all thrashed and oogey. The eng. comp. is pretty clean
too. Looks like the oil is behind the fan housing...and I could swear that in
the dark, there even appeared to be oil coated along the top of the
underbelly...
  Again, thanks skads in advance for any advice/aid. Y'all have helped us get
this far and that's really saying something!
