Subject: T4 engine out, now the fun begins

thanks to all those who relayed input on the first time FI T4 engine pull.
a few odd things were found so far. the egr was blocked off at every
possible juncture; the filter, the pipe running to the throttle valve
housing, all joints filled with orange silicone. i have a spare filter, and
am gonna try to remove and salvage that pipe to the throttle housing. i
guess its not all that odd that people do block the egr, but i didn't think
it was necessary to block each and every bit of it. another thing was both
cv joints leaked what appeared to be tranny fluid on the tranny sides. i'll
be reconditioning that tranny with seals and gaskets, but need i freak that
small amounts of fluid may be in the cv joints? liquid wrench on head bolts
and tomorrow i'll dismantle.   - steve
