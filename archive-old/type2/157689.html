Subject: [T2]Help with 73 westy stay running

i have got a 73 westy just bought that i have put new 
  wires 
  plugs
  dizzy
  points
  intake boots
  manifold gaskets
   oil change
   
  it has a old holley carb on it kinda like a 32/36 defv but oval not sqaure...
   
  the bus is fantastic and in good timing and all...
   
  i can hear the fuel pump clicking so it is going...
   
  problem is this...
  i can drive it for a little bit sometimes more than other times but still not getting far up the road before it will just die....
   
  i try to crank it back up and it wont crank almost like it is flooded kinda symptom...  now if i sit there for a short bit she will crank up and act like she never cut off and run fine and then out of nowhere she will cut off again...
   
  i have narrowed to being either the carb or the fule pump???
   
  i have also plugged the brake booster off just for laughs i recon...
   
  trying to cover everything...
   anyone got any idea what could be causing this...
   
  i swear it is almost like it just didnt get gas and quits and then it takes time to get gas again and will start back up and run again..???
   
  i gotta get her down the road in the morning to try to get some other things done to her but gosh this is kicking my butt.....
   
  any advice hear or anything it sounds like it might be...?or something someone else has experienced it might be??
   
  thanks in advance
  chai
