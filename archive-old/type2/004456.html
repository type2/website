&gt; I try to share as much info as possible about my experiences with CR as I
&gt; possibly can, without letting the total cat out of the bag, and giving
every
&gt; thing I have learned up for the internet world to &quot;Cut&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; into
&gt; their own armory of knowledge.

Why not?  I think they call it sharing ideas!  Isn't that what this list is
all about? Sharing ideas, and helping others with knowledge/power. Oh, sorry
maybe someone out there has a patent on wrenching.

Now that I have your attention:  Here's a question for you all.  Does anyone
have a line on a clean 68 thru 71 bus * any style near So Cal* that I can
pick up for little $$ for restoration???

Cheers,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Would we have a lot of trouble with gas at low altitudes with the
higher
&gt; &gt; &gt;  CR? I know the magic number used to be 9:1 or was it 9.5:1. But all
the
&gt; &gt; &gt;  changes in gas over the years, I don't know what a safe CR is
anymore.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Before anybody goes and builds an engine with 8:1 compression they
should
&gt; &gt; read what Gene Berg has to say about compression ratios.  You can call
&gt; &gt; 714-998-7500 to get a catalog and the info is in there.
&gt; &gt; I contacted Jake (the guy who originally suggested 8:1 CR's) off line
and
&gt; &gt; asked a few specific questions about his recommendation.  I didn't
expect
&gt; him
&gt; &gt; to spend lots of time replying and I deleted the post so I can't quote
&gt; him.
&gt; &gt; However, I did get some impressions that I think are worthwhile to pass
on
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; the list.
&gt; &gt; I asked him what kind of engine life to expect with 8:1 compression.
&gt; &gt; Specifically I asked if he's gotten 100,000 miles or more on such an
&gt; engine.
&gt; &gt; He didn't answer that question.
&gt; &gt; What he did say was that after much trial and error he has a formula
&gt; where,
&gt; &gt; by adjusting valve sizes and cam grinds he's able to make 8:1 work.  He
&gt; &gt; wasn't willing to share any of that info, however.
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I think that there is a whole lot more to this than just raising
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; compression ratio and driving your bus as usual.  I'd hate to see
somebody
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; this and go out and burn a hole in a piston because of running a CR that
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; too high.
