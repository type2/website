Subject: [T2] 411 412 Engine conversion
Date: Wed, 13 Jun 2001 11:07:47 -0700

	Hello List(ees),
I am seeking knowledge (no, not enlightenment...yet) and advice on an engine
transplant from a 411/412 to a '70 Bus.  The engine is in a low mileage
vehicle, still owned by the original owner's family.  What I am curious
about are the engine specifics.  I was hoping to grab a 2.) 914
case/longblock, and rebuild it to push my Big Green Behemoth (I mean it in
the most loving of ways).  Another question is regarding the braking system
on these.  Are the calipers the same as the late Bay's?  Are they
proprietary only to the type 4XX's?  They're rather large, so I am positive
they aren't the same as the type 1's and 3's.  I am going to attempt a CIS-E
injection setup on the motor eventually as well.  Short of the type 4
changeover, I'm leaning more and more toward a VR6 conversion.  Any help or
advice both on and off list is welcome.  Thanks!

	Eron
