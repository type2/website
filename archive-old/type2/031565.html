&gt; I have a 73' Westy with a GEX 1.8L hydraulic valve

&gt; a VDO electric sender and gauge.  At cold idle I am at
&gt; 65/70 PSI, as things heat up and I'm zooming down the
&gt; freeway at 60/65 it goes as low as 20PSI.  At hot idle
&gt; it is 8/10 PSI by the gauge, the oil light never
&gt; flickers or comes on.  Is this a normal range for this
&gt; vehicle?

That is absolutely phenominal on a GEX engine!!!!!!!
