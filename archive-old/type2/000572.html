#1 EVERYONE get outta the archives under the heading &quot;heating&quot; your slowing
me down( Im on a Chicago Winter deadline here!!)
#2 While FULLY INSULATING with R-13 insulation I was looking for some new
paneling for Blue. I found a few I could live with but on most if not all of
the cozy rustic looking patterns and style they said exspressly &quot;NOT to be
used in mobile homes&quot; whats up with that?
what Im wondering is do I have to pay attention to that and risk the
aesthetics of Blues soft cushy innerds? ( he would be diffenitly pissed) or
is that for some unrelated reason? Mobile home meaning RV or meaning
Trailer? Has anyone else replaced their paneling that ran into this and used
it anyway? Did your walls catch fire after two days or something horrible? I
think Im missing something.....
I would appreciate any wisdom on this or any past experience with paneling
(if youve never taken your paneling off, DO SO. Its no biggie and once you
see what passes for insulation you will feel like youve been taken. Insulate
that baby if its the last thing you do!!  :)

Again thanks for reading this and thnx in advance for your help.
