Hi Barry,
Well, as part of my question on the &quot;best&quot; coil design I am asking if 
anybody has a learned experience/preference on the dielectric material used 
inside of the coil can.

The dielectric is the insulating substance used to keep the coil from 
shorting out to itself among the individual windings, as well as preventing 
the coil from shorting out against all other mounting supports and 
components internal to the coil's housing (can).

As I understand it, there exists about three selections for insulating 
materials:
Oil (which may have PCB compounds in the very old coils)
Silicon (as used in some &quot;high end&quot; designs)
Epoxy ( not sure if this is used in any coil manufacturing designs)

One consideration beyond just insulation characteristics of the dielectric 
selection will be it's ability to dissipate the heat buildup created within 
the can as developed by the flow of current through the coil's internal 
wire's resistance value.

I think the Blue Coil, and especially the older blue coils will be oil 
filled, but I just do not know, hence my asking of our learned body of bus 
folk.
