Subject: 1971 CONVERSION by ?????

I have a late 70 that was converted in late 1970 or early 1971.  I am
having difficulty identifying the manufacturer of the conversion.  On
the outer passenger, I have a brass plate with the following
info:                                 S2050 RV
                                       7692 1971

The bus has a fiberglass top with a roof rack.  Inside is a AC/DC fridge
, sink with air pressure tank,
2 burner propane stove, hanging bed and fold down rear seat.

If the manuafacturer can be identified, I am looking for a wiring
diagramas well cabinet details (blueprint) for my restoration.  Can
anyone assist with the detective work?
