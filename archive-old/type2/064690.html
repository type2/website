Subject: BBQ for Gerry &amp; Friends 

Okay, Since my last reply in response to Martha's party
on Saturday I've received 0 responses from anyone who'd be
interested in coming to Sacramento (or from those that already
live in the Sacramento area).  So I assume the bulk of you
only want to party on Saturday evening and that Sunday is a
big &quot;?&quot;.  Well.... I guess I can play it by ear, but I get the
feeling that the BBQ in Sacramento for Gerry is going to be a
small group.  On the other hand, if you plan to come to Sacra-
mento and know it for sure, I'd really appreciate you letting me
know so that I can have a head count of some kind.  Otherwise,
I guess Gerry, his wife, Linda &amp; I will have the pool and BBQ
to ourselves.  ......Maybe we should just order pizza.  :]

Garcon!  More beer!  More beer!  ;)
