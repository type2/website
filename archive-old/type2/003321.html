+AD4-I have a '71 Bus with a sliding door problem I can't figure out.

Hi Christian,

I had this problem. To cure it you've got to get the door properly balanced
on the two rollers top and bottom and make sure the back spring out arm is
well adjusted and greased. If it's only the back part you've had off the
problem will be there. If the door is out of square with the frame it may
stick. Takes a bit of trial and error but once you have a good look at it it
makes sense.
