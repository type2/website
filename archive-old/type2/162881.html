Subject: front-seat headrests

	Has anyone added headrests to the front seats of a '73 kombi? 
Whiplash is real, and my wife is a nurse  ...   It's not that we 
expect water-injection to snap our heads back so viciously, nor even 
that we expect belated NZ apeing of the '65 USA Whiplash Insurance 
Caper (slap a strong roll-cage into a junker car with OK brakes, pass 
some wealthy- or corporate-looking driver at the speed limit, pull in 
just ahead of him/her, and stand on the brakes.  Sue the 'offender' 
and settle with his insurance company at $bulk for whiplash, at that 
time defined on cardinal symptoms not signs).    But my wife is 
right.  Surely there is someone else whose wife has said &quot;I feel very 
vulnerable&quot; ?
	Are those 'coat hanger' knobs just aft of the head strong 
enough to be one fixing of a headrest independent of the seat, or 
must one weld onto the seat  -  or the bulkhead just behind it?
