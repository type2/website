Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Westy starts and dies

Volks,

Richard Atwell reminds me that it was him who found the sale. Way to go
Richard!!! The address for all the tools that he found and that Andy found
is:

www.actron_dot_com

Go to:
Sunpro then
Garage Sale (top, center of page)
Test &amp; Tune
Digital Engine Multimeter - CP7676GS

That said, I decided to bring some to High Country, so if you are planning
to be there and want to take a chance, I ordered 10 of them and will bring
them for sale (if they get here in time).  The Actron store wants 14.95
per plus 5.97 shipping for UPS ground for a total of $20.92.  I ordered 10
and paid for 2nd day air ($28.25). So *if* they get here, and *if* I get
there, they would be $20 from me ($14.95 + 1/10tho of $28.28 (or 2.83) +
$2.77 making-change charge (I hate making change :) for a total of $20.
So wait up, take the chance, and save a whopping 92 cents!!!!!

Seriouly, I did order, and will have them if you want them.  And believe
me, you *need* one of these!!!  Dwell, tach, volts, ohms all in one small
box.  Barry bought a couple back a bit, I got one from him and I would
sooner part with my &lt;deleted&gt; than this pup.

&gt; &gt; A dwell meter.  You really cannot live without one.  Someone (Barry?)
&gt; &gt; recently found a discontinued SunPro modle on sale, discontinued, for &lt;
&gt; &gt; $20.  Buy one.
