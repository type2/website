K G sends:

&gt; Is there something inherently wrong with these things?

Yeah. People drive 'em like huge water-cooled American vans with monster V-8
engines--they don't change the oil regularly, they don't keep the valves and
timing squared away, they start off in second and skip third, lug the engine
on hills and tow 20-foot boats. We're talking a ton and a half of metal with
a 70-horse engine in it and a four-cylinder one at that; it must be driven
gently compared to a Ford Econoline.

You can get excellent service life out of a Bus, so long as you read John
Muir's &quot;How to Drive a Volkswagen&quot; and do what it says.
