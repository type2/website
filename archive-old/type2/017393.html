&gt; The button on the dash with the &quot;B&quot; on its face is the dual brake circuit

Yes- this is correct, it is an XOR, but implemented in hardware on the
VW dual cylinder setup.  (This persisted into all the H2O cooled I have
worked on, also)  just wanted to clear up a possible misconception that
may cause someone to unnecessarily conclude that their warning circuit
is toasted . . .

&gt; If you wish to conduct a test of the logic, not just the bulb, then get
&gt; under their and remove one set of wires from your master cylinder and put
&gt; on the brakes.  The light should come on and stay on as long as the brakes
&gt; are depressed.  Then switch plugs and make sure it is working the other
&gt; way too.

Removing one of the plugs will not allow the brake warning lite to come
on.  The 3-prong switch is a SPDT, that is there are two switche
positions inside it.  One lead is the &quot;common&quot;.  The way the switches
are wired is just like the &quot;3-way&quot; switch that you have in the hallway,
stairs or front porch.  When the two switches are both in the &quot;same&quot;
position, the circuit is not completed, as the circuit is wired through
one of the &quot;normally&quot; open and one of the &quot;normally closed&quot; contact
sets.  If one circuit fails, the switch won't pick up and there is a
complete path for the current to the warning light.  If either switch
works, it sends current to the brake lights in the back.  To test, you
either need to pull the plug and insert a jumper or unscrew one enough
to relieve pressure in that circuit.
