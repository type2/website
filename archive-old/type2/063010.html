&gt;Agreed, in principal, but not in substance. Locally it's been an influx
&gt;of the young, all wanting to experience the VW tradition, that has
&gt;decimated the VW population. They hitched into town for a Deadhead
&gt;concert (or similar) and saw all the kewl Veedubs... and motored away
&gt;with one of their very own... with no idea of how to keep one running.

        Fortunately, some of us deadheads decided to try and maintain them
instead. Sadly, we seem to be the minority. It's the old disposable
Amerikan way of thinking. Many seem to think that thier bus will remain in
good condition with little or no sweat. Doesn't happen. Mine's in decent
mechanical condition now only because I've spent countless hours-many in
80+ degree Texas weather-making it that way. Call that sweat, and more than
a little pride in the final job. Now I need to learn body work.

Peace,
