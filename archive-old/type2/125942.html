&gt;in 2001 i had my fuel injection system cleaned by my local mechanic now it is 2004 should i have him do it again. Is there a proper way  of maintaing the sytem any information would be grateful 

Using a FI cleaner every oil change should be enough to keep it clean.

Personally I think the money would be better spent on having the injectors cleaned by a place like Cruzin Performance and the metal fuel rails cleaned off the engine with a stronger cleaner if it's never been done before.
