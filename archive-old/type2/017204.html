     I've had intermittent problems that sound about like what you're
describing, but it's definitely my rear emergency brake shoe. I'm not
sure what it does, but it seems to happen if I brake hard while going
backwards, and it's only on one side, but it makes a rapid sort of
clunk-clunk-clunk-clunk as I'm going along, more noticable of course
when coasting to a stop. The way I make it go away is to pull the
emergency brake on as hard as I can (only my e-brake doesn't work really
since the left side backing plate is all ratted out where the e-brake
cable goes in) and go in reverse and slam on the brake a few times. Or
take the drum off and relocate the brake shoe.
