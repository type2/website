Subject: RE: [T2] Bus soundproofing - a long-lost URL

That NASA stuff is the stuff you can buy through the JC Whitney Catalogue. I
used it on my 61 Ford Econoline, which is a cab-over and can get pretty hot.
It's ok, but it's really just a carpet padding-like substance with a
aluminium skin on one side. As I've said before, when I get around to sound
proofing and heat proofing the bus next spring, I'm going to try out the
materials at www.coolandquiet_dot_com, which are more modern, fiberglass based
mats which are the same products being used in the new cars today. I used to
do PR for Lydall, and comparing the two (NASA vs Lydall) there's no
comparison, in both quality and weight (the NASA stuff weighs like 5X as
much). Of course, the joke I always tell about &quot;NASA Technology&quot; is they
were still using 8088 IBM XT computers in the space shuttle up until about 4
years ago, when your home computer was able to do more processing than all
of the computers on the space shuttle combined! I sometimes wonder why
companies brag about using NASA technology, I'd be embarrased most of the
time!
