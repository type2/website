Subject: Too hot?

Temp sensor not on the bus yet.  After a short (15 min) drive at 45-50mph,
dipstick is very warm but nowhere near &quot;too hot to hold&quot;.  Unscrew the oil
cap, white smoke comes out.

Water vapor?  Doesn't really look like it.  Using Castrol synthetic here.

Ideas?  Comments?  Physical threats?
