Hello all,
	I finally purchased a dial indicator yesterday to measure my
crankshaft endplay on my 1600 DP (the one I ordered from Harbor Freight
never came-ordered first week of January). The endplay measures 0.020. This
seems like a lot. Can this be shimmed? I really don't want to split the case
and rebuild this myself. Does anyone sell short blocks?  I am thinking of
just putting on my new heads, pistons and cylinders and just driving it for
a while. Spring fever  here in Massachusetts spreads quicker than foot and
mouth disease.

Thanks in advance for your wise advise,

Jeff
