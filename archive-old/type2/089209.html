Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Frozen Brakes!??



&gt; Rather than start whacking away with a hammer, I decided I would
first take the
drum off and take a good look at what might be causing it.  I
removed the two 11mm
screws and pulled and pulled and banged a little and pulled some
more, and that sucker
wasn't coming off.&lt;

If your brakes are adjusted correctly your drum will never come off in this
manner. Unless you hit the drum so hard you brake the linings off the shoes,
and even then I dont know if the drums would come off.

&gt; I then crawled beneath to try and back the shoes off a bit, but
&gt; alas!  Those adjusting stars
&gt; were going **nowhere**.  I didn't want to use undue force, as the
&gt; metal backing plate was
&gt; starting to &quot;tear&quot; with each new attempt.

You should try a penetrating oil on the stars, it will loosen them up. I use
the GUNK brand, available at Lowes and Home Depot.

&gt; So I banged the crap
out of the drum, all around
in a circle, with a keen rubber mallet.  Still no joy on removing
the drum - but suddenly I
&gt; could turn the wheel.

You probably got the one shoe that wasnt retracting to move back enough to
release the drum.

&gt; I'm not sure why I couldn't get the drum
&gt; off..

The shoes were still preventing it.

&gt;. I replaced the brakes
&gt; some 2kmiles ago.  Shouldn't be rusted already,

Did you also replace the wheel cylinder and all the brake hardware? Whenever
you work on a van that you have no clue about it's history I find its better
to overdo it, and replace EVERYTHING, ESPECIALLY on brakes. So what if the
wheel cylinder didnt need replacing, it will one day, and you will already
have a spare.

Did you bleed the brakes correctly?

&gt; which leads me to
&gt; think the shoes are
&gt; lipping against the drum??

I am sure they are.

&gt; All things returned, I took her for a
&gt; test drive.
&gt;
&gt; Damn.  Idiot break light is on - but strangely, only when **not**
&gt; applying the breaks.  If
&gt; I apply the breaks, off goes the light.

Sounds like you need to try bleeding your brakes.
