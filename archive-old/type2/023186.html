Subject: 2nd battery...technical question...
Mime-Version: 1.0

okay, so i have some questions about the standard factory setup for a westy 
with a 2nd battery.

(please correct me if i'm wrong...i'm an architect, not an engineer!)

when the vehicle is running, the alternator charges the main battery and 
trickle charges the aux. battery.  all of the vehicles interior lights and 
such (does this include fridge and sink?) run off of the main battery.

when the vehicle is off, the relay closes the connection to the main 
battery and EVERYTHING (?) runs off of the aux. battery.  (does this 
include all lights, radio, fridge, sink....)

then the vehicle is stared using the main battery and the process starts again.

thanks for your technical input!
