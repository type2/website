&quot;Bob Perring&quot; &lt;perring_at_pdq_dot_net&gt; queried
&gt; All you fellows out there with 1970 Westy campers in the white color.
&gt; Was there more than one white ??
&gt;
&gt; What &quot;generic&quot; white off of the shelf paint (either bottle with little
&gt; dabber, or spray)  have you found and used successfully to cover up
&gt; dings and chips?

Bob and list,
The closest thing I found in a spray can was Krylon Truck and Van Paint,
&quot;Wimbledon White&quot;.  I didn't try a spot test, but sprayed the entire top
part.  BTW, Rustoleum Hunter Green is a good match for 1970 Elm Green.
