Subject: Re: [T2] Wont start update

Chris,

Instead of screwing around tring to figure this one out on your
own--take that starter out, take it to any reputable FLAPs and let them
put it on their current draw starter tester.
This will tell you everthing you wanted to know, and maybe somethings
you don't.

Quick, simple, and at least you'll know where you stand real quick.

Later,

Terry

update
[...]
I got under the van and the first thing I checked was the WR1 relay...
sure enough the 15 amp fuse was fried. replaced the fuse, but still no
start.
Taking a page from Muir, with the key out of the ignition van in neutral
handbrake on, I took a screwdriver and bridged the two large bolts on
the solinoid. There was a spark, so I was clearly getting current... but
the starter did not engage.
Time for a new Starter?
Thanks,
Chris

Did I screw something up (see attached post)? I was cranking the starter
for WAY too long. I tried the van today, and it wouldn't turn over at
all... I turned the key and I just got a click. Its not the battery...
the interior lights are bright but just to be sure I hooked it up to my
running car to no avail.
Not to prejudice your responses but I have one of those WR1 relay kits
and I am wondering if I blew the fuse in it.... Has anyone replaced one
of these? How do I test it?
Thanks,
Chris

Here in Toronto it is -4C or -10C with the wind chill, I am not sure
what that is in degrees F but trust me its cold. I have been having this
problem for a while and today it finally gave up.
I can hear the van turning over but it doesn't &quot;catch&quot;. If I keep my
foot on the throttle and keek the key turned to start the engine almost,
but doesn't quite, start. When it was slightly warmer the same thing was
happening but it would eventually start.
