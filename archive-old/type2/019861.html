&gt; &gt;he said the interior looked pretty good by flashlight.
&gt; 
&gt; you should have taken the hint- the tank is clean already...and those little
&gt; paddy things come off real easy to paint the tank and then reglue them...

Well, since the bus is a 69 that I just got sans engine and trans, and I
know Chuck had it sitting for at least 10 months (he showed me a picture
of it last December), I thought a little cleaning was in order before I
put the engine and tranny in. Preventive maintenance. I'm replacing the
little screen and &quot;union nut&quot; while I'm at (they're cheap).

&gt; connect the sender and ground it, then move the float and
&gt; see the level at the dash gauge. if the gauge was accurate before, then don't
&gt; bend the arm, but if not, then when you install the tank, check the gauge at
&gt; empty and then either adjust ( bend ) the arm or fill the tank, check the gauge
&gt; at full mark and adjust it there.

Dunno if the gauge was accurate before (see brief history above). So
I'll have to reinstall the gas tank and wait until I get a battery in it
before I can do this test. Ok.
