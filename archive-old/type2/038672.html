Subject: Re: '77 Westy EFI Sputtering

Fuel filter or fuel pump, I agree, and something strange I ran into a few years back -  O2 sensor.  My '77 Westy would go for longer though.  Maybe 30-40 miles and then just act like it ran smack out of fuel.  After a little cool-down it would go again. Sensor fixed it.  Rob
