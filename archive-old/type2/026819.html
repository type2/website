OK, I have a new parking brake cable.  I want to install it.  I did remove 
the adjusting nut that holds the cable to the equalizer bar, and I unhooked 
the brake cable from the lever on the rear most brake shoe.

Bentley says:  10.3  Remove &amp; Installing brake cable-

&quot;unbolt the bracket that holds the cable to the backing plate.&quot;

I cannot find anything that looks like a BOLT or a clip that holds the brake 
cable to the backing plate.

Haynes is useless (but you knew that!!)

RSVP (response if you please)
