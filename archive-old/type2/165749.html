Subject: Front turn signals no longer work?

Hi bussers,

'71 Westy(KK) 1600dp

My front turn signals decided not to work today. I was getting my
morning coffee and I noticed in the big glass window I park in front
of that my blinker was not blinking. I proceeded to work and looked in
the archives. Still no blinkers, but here is what I have done to
diagnose.

When I turn my blinkers on left or right, I get a normal signal in the
dash. The hazards make the blinkers work. The rear blinkers work as
they should. This is consistent with my lights on, only parking lights
on, and all lights off. What should I do next to fix my front turn
signals?

Thank you,

Max
