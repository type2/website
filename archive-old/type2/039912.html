Subject: '73 bus

    I have an orange '73 bus that I'm going to need to get rid of soon.  The 
engine is &quot;tired&quot; and it doesn't want to move.  I've taken a lot of the 
interior out of it, and I will be taking a few more things before I get rid 
of it.  It has some body rust, but not too bad.  It has a good amount of rust 
underneath.  Front seats are in bad condition, may come with fold down bed in 
pretty good condition.  Really, really don't want to get rid of it, but can't 
afford to keep it.  I'd like to see it go to a good home (not a junkyard), 
but even just for parts would be better than nothing.  Not asking very much, 
make an offer.  I live in central IL.  E-mail me for pictures.
   
   Amy
