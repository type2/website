Subject: Re: [T2] water injection on a fuel injection engine

Ned asked
&gt;  I have a 78 2L engine, pretty much all stock with the exception of 
&gt;compufire ignition. Any thoughts on where we would inject the water?

	I have much more experience with carbs than with FI.  On the 
basis of trials with only a few petrol or diesel cars, all I can say 
is: slap a big needle (e.g  blood donor needle) into a narrow part of 
the induction tract after the air-cleaner.  If the water sucked in 
turns out to be &lt;5% of the fuel, add another needle.
	Never forget the water bottle must NOT gravity-feed  - 
including while parked on slopes.  In a T2 with 'upright' motor, on 
tin platform just to one side of motor can be OK; you may have to 
resort to a bottom rear corner of body, outside engine compartment 
but invisible from outside.

	Even before you get around to acquiring that big needle by 
giving blood  -  or should that read selling?  -  do start measuring 
fuel consumption so you'll be able to compare.  The only accurate way 
is:
1  fill tank
2  write down mileage, or zero trip meter
3  fill tank again after most of a tank
4 divide fuel to fill into miles done
