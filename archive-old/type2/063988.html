&gt; Since the heater thread is starting up again (yup, I feel winter
&gt; a-comin' too) I thought I'd advance the ludicrous idea I had for
&gt; converting the heat system on my Westy:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Cut holes for air intake near front seats, cover with clamshell vent
&gt; covers
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Run hose back along underside of bus (next to heat return hose) from
&gt; said holes to heat exchangers
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Attach to intake of heat exchangers
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Install marine blower in heat tube at front of bus
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Built ply and plexi partition to fit over seat backs
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is to build a recirculating system that isolates the cab from
&gt; the rest of the bus - if we had to sleep in it, we'd use our usual
&gt; little electric heater. Whaddya think? I think the problems are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Recirculating air will get chilled on its way to the back of the bus
&gt; 
&gt; 2. How to run the hoses up into the engine compartment and then back
&gt; down to the exchangers - maybe try to lose a little of the end of the
&gt; exchanger and run the whole thing below the engine...
&gt; 
&gt; Feedback? Comments? Insults?

&gt; ***********************************************************The cheapest method I found for improving heat in a van was to build a 
curtain behind the front seats. I used quilting material, with the 
built-in layer of &quot;silver&quot; stuff to help radiate heat forward. Total 
cost was under $20. I used it in a 73, so I did have the advantage of an 
improved heater (via the blower &amp; larger engine)... but up 'til then, 
I'd always had a draft on my kneck, until I traveled at least 20 miles, 
on a mild day. To see out the window, and allow some heat to circulate, 
I cut a small opening in the blanket at mirror level.

When things were warmer, I could bunch the blanket up, using some strips 
of the cover material as ties. 

When I find an old split, I think I'll look into *SOMEHOW* adding a 
blower into the system. Having driven both, I think this is the major 
improvement they put in the &quot;later&quot; vans.
