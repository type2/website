Automatic?

&gt; Also i've sprayed carb cleaner over every hose, intake manifold, fuel
&gt; injector, etc. to see if I could detect a change in idle.

I've had no luck at all with this method or listening using the paper towel
tube trick.  If you have the EGR system active, it will be even harder to
listen for leaks.

&gt; Afterward I checked vacuum at idle
&gt; again and got the same readings.  If some people are getting readings
&gt; as high as 17&quot; or 18&quot; then I figure I must have a vacuum leak.

My vacuum currently reads 15.5-16&quot; when my gauge is teed into the side of
the air plenum.  It has been as high as 17.5&quot; and I wonder what exactly
changes to vary the reading from one month to the next when I check it.  The
only thing I can think of is a change in the hydraulic valves because it
jumped high right after my last (and only) adjustment.

Don't forget to calculate 1&quot; of vacuum loss for every 1000 ft. of elevation
but you can't do much about that.

You're also going to loose a 1/2&quot; to 1&quot; for variations in timing because
you're still using points.  It's the minimum reading that counts.

I think it's pretty hard to get to the Steve Dolan level of ideal vacuum as
evidenced by the extensive work you did. Steve Dolan assured me once that
unless your air plenum is very rusted you probably don't have a leak.  Same
goes for the fuel pressure regulator.

If you had the CA 79 ECU and O2 sensor on that engine you'd have to worry
less about the current state of vacuum  because small leaks should be
partially compensated for as the mixture is automatically adjusted.  That's
my theory anyway.  Charles probably could confirm this.
