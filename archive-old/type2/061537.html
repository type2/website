Subject: fuel pump studs
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings and salutations...

I have found, to my great dismay, that both mounting studs for my fuel pump
are stripped...  Don't ask me how 'cause I don't know....:)

I've got a tap/die set and am planning on rethreading them this weekend....
Has anyone done this before and can offer any suggestions?  Would it be
easier to install new studs?  I know I've got to take out the dizzy, but I
don't know what else might have to be moved to rethread..

And a related question....  Given that the fuel pump is slightly loose at
the base, what potential problems exist in performance aside from the pump
eventually working loose and the associated mess...?

Would this affect vacuum?  Doesn't seem like it...  There is a small amount
of oil leakage/spray from this, but I wondered what else might go wrong?
Would this impair the fuel delivery of the pump?  Seems like it might...

So, to change out the studs or rethread them....  Damn, I wish it were the
nuts that were stripped....

Cheers,

Tom
