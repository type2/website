Subject: '78 oil leak

Well I've got it to where she starts and idles fine, now it's time to address the oil leak. It started on my trip from Central America a couple of months ago. It seems to come from on top in the front on the pax side and is pretty heavy, I have to add a qt. every 300 miles or so. I have to go to Florida for a couple of days and was thinking about detouring on the way back to a friends airplane hanger in Arkansas. I'm no mechanic, he is but I can only count on advice and tools. Am I going to be able to pull the engine and fix the leaks myself or should I save up for a professional?
