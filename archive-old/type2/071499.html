Subject: engine lids
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Gentlepersons-
                       My 79 Bay has developed a seriously dented engine lid 
courtesy of some
yahoo in a parking lot...I've got a 71 lid and lower apron (I already know 
the lid won't just bolt in), other than the obvious PITA of cutting out the 
existing apron, my question
is, will the body remain stable enough with the 79 apron removed? I'll fab 
brackets to
mount the 71 apron, but will I start getting middle-aged spread in the rear 
quarters
without the welded in apron? The thought of having a top hatch, and a 
completely open
engine compartment appeals to me immensely...
                      BTW, does anybody else, with a 79, have a spot welded 
hinge? Mine does,
unlike the 71's bolted hinge. Is/was this original? By this time, the 79 has 
enough re-
placement pieces to qualify as &quot;other&quot; on the census form...
Thanks in advance.
