&gt;   How can I show or prove that the VW Type 2 is constructed on a truck 
&gt; chassis??

it isn't it is unibody construction and has no seperate chassis

&gt;   &quot;Multipurpose passenger vehicle&quot; means any motor vehicle that is (i) 
&gt; designed to carry no more than ten persons and (ii) constructed either on a 
&gt; truck chassis or with special
&gt;   features for occasional off-road use; &quot;

usually having a stove and fridge is enough, and a Westy has those...

copy page 3 of the Bentley manual, second paragraph says in part

&quot;The Station Wagon, Kombi, Campmobile, Delivery Van, and Pick-Up truck
share the same frame....&quot;

further in paragraph 4 it says &quot;The bodies of the Station Wagon, Kombi,
Campmobile, and delivery van differ only in their window arrangements and
trim&quot;

Hope this will help
