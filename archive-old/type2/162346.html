&gt; &gt; I have teh Weld-Pak 100 along with the gas setup. it has served me well on
&gt; &gt; my Bus. will do anything I've asked it to do and seems to have pretty good
&gt; &gt; control for an inexpensive welder.  wouldn't want to use it in production
&gt; &gt; work, have had to stop once or twice to let it cool down but nothing
&gt; &gt; serious.   think I paid around $250 or so for it +the gas setup etc. was
&gt; &gt; close to $500 in the garage welding.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    From what I've gathered from a web search, the 3200 is the 100 with
&gt; the gas set up...$459 at HD...Sadly, the local welder's supply house wants

that sounds about right, does it include the gas bottle?? these can be
pricy, I have a larger size at the empty bottle was about $70 or so plus
another $20 or a bit to fill it.  of course you only buy the bottle once.

&gt; Yeah, I know about the ones at Harbor Freight...But even if everything &quot;will&quot;
&gt; be Chinese made, I'd like to give us locals a chance at keeping their jobs...

yeah but it gets to be &quot;who's local&quot; bought a big Maytag airconditioner
for my office, was surprised to open the box and find &quot;made in china&quot;

&gt; BTW, keep an eye on Milwaukee Tools...Good chance they may be moving to
&gt; the East, since they've been bought by the same big conglomerate that runs
&gt; the Ridgid woodworking tools... ;-(

yeah again got the same surprise when I bought a miter saw a few weeks
ago, &quot;made in china&quot;   pretty soon Americans will be made in China....
