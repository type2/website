Subject: Bay popout windows; busses in Germany; Ben Pon....

Re the query on POPOUT windows for bays- I saw these on busses in
Germany on the trip I just returned from.  - can send a pic to anyone
asking by p-mail.  Also, I noticed that MOST of the Westies there have
High-Tops, those solid fiberglass
Tops that are higher in front.   Saw only one Bay Window bus (neat paint
job) and a lot of Vanagons, many of them 4WD Synchros.......
    The German Magazine VW Scene has a neat article on the origin of the
BUS, with the original sketch by Ben Pon of the Kastenwagen he discussed
in his meeting with Col. C. Radclyffe, dated 4/23/47.  Some neat early
ads are included.  MB 78 Westy
