Hey, all.

Sorry I've been snivelling and lurking over here in the corner for so
long. I have been reading the messages, tho. Most of them.

Chris Binder sent me a message Sunday night inquiring if I still had a
BA6 for sale (I don't, so don't call), and I did a search for
Eberspacher and got their new web page
http://www.eberspaecher_dot_de/htmleng/i_airh.htm .
They have what appears to be a unit that could easily be placed in the
heater tube on a type 2, similar to the BA6. Check it out!
