X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

I am looking for anyone that would like to make some travel plans across any part of Europe this summer.  I will be available to travel from June 15 til the end of August. Plans could include seeing VW shows or seeing Wolfsburg. I will do this trip on my own but would love to have some one else to go with.  Any other inquiries can be sent directly to me at Westyfalia_at_aol_dot_com subject being (travel europe). Or call at 06221-796491  I look forward to all responses. I will be traveling in a 1976 Non Pop top Westy.  
Peace Out
Rick
