Subject: Re: Portable fridge advice needed

Alex, you don't say what your bus is- is it a Westy?  These can be made
cooler inside since they shade themselves with the poptop and can have
the windows covered. We have an awning also and use it on the sunny side
when parking; use the windshield curtain ON THE OUTSIDE to prevent heat
buildup.
     Having over 440K camping experience, I suggest you consider our
tricks:
     - Any Holiday Inn /large chain Motel has Ice Machines you can
utilize!  We'd actually use one sometimes as a break in routine or if
weather was terrible.  Campgrounds also have ice.  This is useful not
only for the cooler but also to add to your drinks- we keep a spare
&quot;Pony&quot; small cooler for the overflow ice.
   -I removed the ammonia ice fridge because it took up space in our 78
Westy (added the fulll bedseat), and it was hot in summer.  You'd need a
fridge that vents to the outside to prevent extra heat buildup during
heat exchange.  
-We use a portable cooler, and have 2 kinds- one is the long one with
the flip up handle and wheels; the top flips from the short side.
Fits between the front seats or behind the passenger seat.  Has a huge
capacity for stuff plus the ice.  For weekend trips, we freeze water in
1/2 gallon old OJ cartons with the screw caps.  Freeze whole boxes of
Capri Sun drinks!  On 3 day trips, they are ready for drinking in 2
days.  The fridge makes a great extra stool/table.
3.  For trips longer than 3 days where we drive a lot, we do have a long
seat-size Coleman thermocouple fridge, which does an OK job if you bear
in mind that what you put in it must be cold, and do not block the air
outlet inside, and keep the most sensitive stuff (milk, OJ near this
outlet.  As a buffer, I still try to add ice in 1/2 gallon containers;
the OJ &quot;Milk carton&quot; style can be pulled apart at the top and filled. 
We put the fridge outside when sleeping; quieter and less extra heat.
     Because all of these use up about 4 amps, I'd suggest a source of
power at night even with a spare battery, or you'd have a short lived
battery if constantly loaded below 25% of its capacity even if a &quot;deep
cycle&quot; type.  Camping World sells inline voltage monitors/cutouts which
kill the power to the fridge when it drops to 11 volts.
