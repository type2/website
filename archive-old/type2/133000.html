&gt; Anybody have any &quot;first step&quot; suggestions for me.  I rescued a bus from
&gt; rotting behind an old garage.  It's been sitting for about 3 years.  I've done
&gt; some minor tasks (emptying tank, new accelerator cable, new batt., jump start
&gt; the starter) and still she's undriveable.  My problem is that as soon as I
&gt; start it up, it shoots up to extreme rpms.  As if I had it floored.  What
&gt; would everybody suggest my first step to be (after beating my head against the
&gt; wall, done that) ...spark plugs?  rebuild the carbs?
