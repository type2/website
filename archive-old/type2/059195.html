Subject: RE: Gas Fumes After Refueling

Jeff,
  Had the same problem. Looked and Looked but could never find a leak or
bad hose.
The smell was only in the engine compartment not under the bus. I
finally found a 2&quot;
length of hose that spans a break in the Vapor condensor lines. Those
are the steel
lines that run up into your air vent/scoop then runs back down (it has
like a bulb in-line).
Anyway, as you are looking in to your engine compartment this rubber
&quot;splice&quot; is
on the left side. You can see it if you get a flashlight and kinda stick
your head in over there.
Just follo the steel line back towards the firewall. The splice is about
6&quot; after the bend
in the line where it takes off towards the back.
  Now the only reason I found it was that I had the pump handle on the
lowest rate notch.
This resulted (i think) in a bit of an overfill. The gas actually ran
out of the tank, up the line
and into my engine compartment. I think some expansion occured also as I
stood and
talked to a fellow Vee-Dubber for a a couple of minutes which allowed me
to observe the
gas running out the drain hole on the deck behind the tail light and on
to the ground.
  Now the smell was only obvious in the cab after filling the tank or
after going up a
steep hill. Sound familure?


 What else can cause gas fumes in the cabin? BTW, I did'nt overfill the
tank.   Thanks, Jeff
