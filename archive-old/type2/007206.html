Subject: Need distributor/carb info

Exploring my 1971 bus engine I have discovered that the case is Mexican yet
all of the other parts (so far) seem to be German except for the carb which
is a Bocar 34-pict-3. I'm puzzled about the distributor it's VW part#
113-905-205AL (Bosch part# 0-231-146-101). I can't seem to find a lot of
information on this distributor.

Is this an adequate dist/carb configuration for my bus?
What should my timing be for this configuration?

Thanks for any help.
