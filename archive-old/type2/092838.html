&gt;Hello.  I just bought a battery isolator from Napa.  I printed out the

Do yourself a favor.  Return the isolator and get a high-power relay that 
is simply wired to the ignition so that it will connect the batteries when 
the key is on.  The relay is available at Camping World and other 
places.  Plenty of info in the archives on this too.
