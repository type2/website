Subject: RE: Help!  For anyone with Hankook tires on a Vanagon/Bubble
  Bus

Sorry for the delay, I don't read the email on weekends.  Answers
interspersed below:

&gt;Something seems amiss here, as this description doesn't sound at all like
&gt;RA08's. They have a comparably stiff sidewall to the Michelins and
&gt;shouldn't be squirrely at all.  In fact the Type2, Vanagon, and Samba
&gt;archives are full of overwhelmingly positive reviews of them (many from
&gt;people who previously used Michelins or Conti's); I don't think there's
&gt;even a single other report of them being &quot;squirrely.&quot;  What's more I have
&gt;never had a single complaint from my customers (nor have I noticed this
&gt;myself, having used both Michelins and Hankooks extensively).

&gt;Are you sure you have the RA08's?
Yup.

&gt;185's or 195's? (A taller sidewall will have slightly more flex, but with
&gt;only a 1/2&quot; difference it shouldn't be as severe as feeling like
&gt;the bus would blow over on every wind gust.)
195s.

&gt;Did you inflate them properly?  (Compared to 205 series tires, 185's and
&gt;195's will require significantly higher inflation; see your door jamb
&gt;sticker.)
I always run my tires toward the maximum recommend inflation printed on
the sidewalls, rather than what VWoA recommends for the car.  Pressure
checked with tires cold.

&gt;Did you take the one tire back to your local Hankook dealer?
Nope, we were on a trip and I didn't have the receipt with me.  Oh well.

&gt;Did you make any other changes to your van at the same time (i.e.
&gt;shocks)?
None.  Just replaced the tires, no other handling changes.

The effect I noticed was only in cross-winds and being passed by semis.
In other conditions the car seemed to drive normally on the RA08s, except
when the RF tire came apart.  Now THAT was exciting at freeway speed...
:)

This was all on a 5K mile trip to Canada that I took last summer.  The car
made it to within 150 miles of home when it dropped a valve.  It's
been here sitting since then.  Sigh.
