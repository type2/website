If a short or ground were the problem, it is more likely that the fuse would
blow immediately when the fan powered up.  If it runs a short time and then
blows a fuse, I'd guess that the bearings are worn and are starting to sieze
when it heats up after a few minutes of use.  I have seen this happen.  I
believe that someone on the list recently suggested lubricating them,
although I have never tried this.

&gt; Twice now, the heater blower has failed to work, and I'm finding out
&gt; each time that it's because of a blown fuse. Any ideas on why I keep
blowing fuses?
