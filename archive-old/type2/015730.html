&gt;I am offering these to the list members for $150.00 per set plus shipping
from
&gt;St. Louis.  This includes seatbelts for both front seats!  I will be putting
&gt;these on my web pages soon for $200.

&gt;I installed these in my '74 Campmobile and can't tell you enough how much I
&gt;love them.  They fit well, and I can now adjust the radio, or reach over and
&gt;open the passenger window without having to slip off the belt.  Best of all,
&gt;these are genuine VW parts.

For those interested in a lower priced alternative, get some Vanagon
seatbelts from the junkyard and fabricate a simple &quot;L&quot; bracket out of 3/16&quot;
steel (available for a few dollars at hardware stores) for the lower mount.
 I did this and it works well and is also made up of genuine VW parts,
except for the bracket.  You can use the existing upper seatbelt mount bolt
or use a longer one and make a spacer so it will pivot.  It does not pivot
with the stock, short bolt but I secured it at a 45 degree angle and it
works fairly well that way if you're careful about how you pull it.
Someday I will make the spacer so it can pivot again, but even as it is,
it's miles ahead of the stock belts, which everyone agrees are a royal PITA.
