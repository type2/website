Snoopy sez
&gt;There is a guy that lives in my town that has a pretty 
&gt;nteresting talent.  He can tell you the make, model and year of your 
&gt;vehicle by the sound of the horn.  Over the phone or in person.  I have 
&gt;heard him many times guess and the worst he was ever off was by a couple 
&gt;years, but he always guessed the make and model.

Hey! What a great country...Outstanding 20th.century pursuit.

VW horns always sound like VW horns. Nothing else mistakenly turns my head
