Subject: How do I get list info?

I just accidently delited ALL m saved messages, and now I need to know
how to change list modes.  I would like to get the introdutory message

please do.

BUS CONTENT
     I had a stripped spark plug hole.  I tried, using the limited
selection of tools that I have, and was unable to fix it.  The first
thing that I did was to put a small insert onto the spark plug, and
tried to screw it in.  No luck there, the hole was just too small.  So,
being the industrious one that I am, I took a drill bit and drilled the
hole just a little bit bigger.  That made the hole a little too big.  I
was out of luck.  I took the engine to the local VW shop, and they
tapped it for a bigger insers (18mm??), and now all is well with the
world.  The moral here, if you don't have the right tool, sometimes the
wrong tool will NOT work, even on a VW  :-)

Have a nice weekend.
