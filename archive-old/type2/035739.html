Subject: Bus tow bars

Y'all forgive me if I've mentioned this before, but I've had success
using a _Beetle_ tow bar on my '71 Westy for close to 100 miles of
in-town and highway use.  Every time this thread comes up I keep meaning
to take photos of the rig Steve Curvey and I came up with, but it's easy
enough to figure out:

1. remove front bumper

2. make something that will bolt to the bumper mount holes on the frame
and extend about a foot in front of the front valance.  Angle iron, even
some spare bumper brackets, whatever.  (Not soft aluminum box beams --
ask me and Steve how we know that.)  It just needs to be a strong,
straight piece of metal about 18-24&quot; long, with holes in it for the
bumper bolts to hold it to the body.  What you're doing is extending the
frame out past the front of the vehicle.

3. affix a heavy pipe to these two sticky-outy things, perpendicular to
them.  Looks like a front push bar.  The pipe is your pseudo axle beam,
so it needs to be big and heavy, but not too thick in diameter to fit
into a beetle tow bar, and it needs to be long enough so that when the
tow bar slides back and forth on the pipe, it will come up against one
of your sticky-outy brackets before sliding off one end of the pipe. 
Got that?

You can affix the pipe to the sticky-outy pieces with U-clamps or
whatever they call em.  I have a more elegant rig that my brother in law
welded up with two bumper brackets bolted and welded to the pipe.  I
made the prototype in less than an hour with a hacksaw and drill, and
about $10 worth of materials.

Use a safety chain.

Like I say, this worked fine for me -- bus tracked behind a Ford
Explorer very politely, no signs of stress afterwards.

Your mileage will most certainly vary.
