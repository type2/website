Subject: Sink Pump Question
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Call me stupid but I can't make my sink pump work. I'm on my 2nd one
now. I thought that the first was damaged but I guess it is something
else. I'm not getting any power at all to the pump. Does anyone know
what Fuse is for the sink pump? or anything else I could check? I've
tested all the two wires and neither of them are hot.
Any suggestions? Please email me directly.

Thanks,

Greg
