The usual culprit is the Temp II sensor located on top of the #3
cylinder head. Could be bad, though it's probably just loose.

&gt; Happy New Year to all....... Needing a little help.  to make a long story short.... 78 Westy was running fine and then started missing and would only go about30-50mph and very rough, missing and backfiring....... so here is my question:  How does a bus run when the catalytic converter is bad, or going bad?  this is just my first thought...... actually....... this is what I am hoping is wrong.... I have had many other thoughts, likd dropped valve........ any thoughts would be appreciated.
