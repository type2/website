Subject: Need Advice For Westy Tent Repair

I have a dirveaway style westy tent, the yellow and blue one with a red 
and white striped awning.  The rings which the tent pegs go through are 
blue rubber jobs that are attached to suction cup-like disks.  these are 
glued to the bottom of the tent.  Some of them have fallen off and are 
gone.  Does anyone out there know a source for these things or for a 
reasonable substitute?  If not, what remedy have other owners used for 
this problem?  They seem to have been attached poorly enough that others 
are bound to have had this problem.  Any help would be appreciated.
