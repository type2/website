Subject: Steering's gone

OK, here's one for you.

My friend Cheryl just called me and said she had a slight problem with Gus,
her 76 Westfalia.  She was turning around in a driveway and heard a loud
bang and lost her steering.  The guy who owned the driveway came out to see
what was the problem, felt around a bit and declared something to be broken,
but the tie rods were ok.  

The bus is on the other side of town from me, so I won't get to look at it
until tomorrow.  I don't know much about the steering mechanism (yet) so I
would appreciate just a few pointers on what to look for when I get there,
or if this has happened to somebody before, maybe there's a way we could fix
it on the fly to get it home.

Any input is appreciated.  Thanx in advance.

Eric Janzen
