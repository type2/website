Subject: Broken exhaust bolts

I of course broke off the bolts between the muffler and the tail pipe. I
bought a ez out and have successfully drilled a hole through one of the
bolts, but can not get the ez out started - Any suggestions.

Or Can I just drill out the offending bolts and buy a bit longer bolts with
a lock washer and nut (like most of the rest of the exhaust)?

Or can I drill out the offending bolts and tap to a size larger?

The rest of my engine build is going well!!
-tin is getting powder coated
- little parts are cleaned and I am starting to paint. I am using an old
metal shed that we don't really use as a little paint booth.

I have some paint the says it cures when exposed to high temps - Has any one
done this? Will it fill my house with toxic fumes if I use my oven?
 
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
