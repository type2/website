Subject: clogged air intake

Hello Volks
	When I attributed my holed piston to clogging of the 
cooling-air intake, some expressed disbelief.
	Pix of this rare problem can now be seen at
http://www.kuratrading_dot_com/HTMLArticles/writings.htm
  by going in through &quot;What's New&quot; ; scroll down to my link and then 
the VW link therein.

	I don't know how often such a disaster can occur, or how 
often it should be inspected for, but if I'd known of the possibility 
I'd have lined up a couple small mirrors or a small TV camera  ...
	By 2016, the J C Whitney catalog will offer a $199.99 midget 
closed-circuit TV, with lo-drain liquid-crystal display on the dash 
so you can view the extent of cooling-air intake clogging on your 
rapidly appreciating VW Type 2 airhowler.  The Wintel conspiracy will 
market a $199.95 Windoze-based add-on realtime Intelligent Program to 
trigger an LED on clogging thresholds adjustable from your driver's 
seat using your cellphone via satellite.  The aerial array for this 
monitoring will double as a GPS speedometer antenna, royalties to Geo.
