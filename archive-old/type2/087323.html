Subject: Oil Gauge hook up

I just received the oil temp gauge and sender from busdepot (Thanks Ron &amp; Staff).  I have a question for those of you who use these or have installed these.  Where do you normally hook up the hot wire from the gauge?  I hate just splicing into a wire I pull out from behind the dash, is there a tab on the fuse box where this can be connected so that it only gets power when the ignition switch is on.  The last time I hooked one of these up on my old 66, the bus had this generic after market ignition switch with an &quot;accessory&quot; contact point hookup, so it was easy on this one.  But we are all stock on the new 71, so WHAT WOULD YOU DO??


Peace, John Baker
