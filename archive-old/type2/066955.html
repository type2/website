SNIP......  I think VW campaigning should 
&gt;hire whoever does the Saturn commercials- they sure do get a good aura 
&gt;going with their small company who loves their work and everyone loves 
&gt;their cars thing, don't they?
Sounds like a good idea, except the image described does not seem to have
any relationship to VWoA. Saturn came up with two very profound marketting
strategies: -Don't treat your customers like idiots
            -A lot of customers are this strange demographic group called
             women. How about we don't insult their intelegence and piss
             them off EVERY time they walk into the showroom.
Which leads to the conclusion: - Our customers are important.

As you can see this wouldn't work talking about VWoA!

Saturn: Average car, Average reliability, Average looks. 
        World class customer relations.

Volkswagon: Nice car. Poor reliability. Euro Looks
            What is this english word you keep using? Customer? 
            Vas ist das Customer? We do not have a German word for this concept.
