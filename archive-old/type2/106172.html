Yes.  Apparently a PO used the wrong fuses in the fuse block, probably
because they were the only ones he had at hand.

&gt; Secondly...i have one fuse that has blown 2 times in
&gt; the last month....(number 2) what could be the cause?

Read the Bentley and figure out what it serves.  Look there.  Also make
sure that the contacts on the fuse holder are clean and that you are using
a new fuse.  Sometimes the contacts themselves get overheated causing fuse
problems.

&gt; And lastly...this past week my headlights have refused
&gt; to work on low beam...flip to high, work
&gt; everytime....any sugeestions??

Wiggle fuses.  Might fix it.  Does the relay click every time you move the
beam lever up?  If not, replace the headlight relay.
