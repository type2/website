Subject: project bus

Hey Everyone - I saw a project bus in Illinois near
Danville.  It made me sad to see it but I can't rescue
it.  It is a blue, mid-70's transporter (i think). 
There was some rust - but nothing too bad.  The
interior has not been taken care of at all.  It has a
sun-roof.  I don't know if it runs and it needs a fuel
pump.  I have the number of the place and would be
willing to either give it to you or call for more info
for you.  I could go look at it again but i'm new at
all of this so probably wouldn't be of much help.  

p-mail me and i'll give you more info.  

thanks!
Chrissie and Gertie
