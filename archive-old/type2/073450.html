&gt;I've seen this thread a couple of times on rec.audio_dot_car as well, and I
&gt;thought I would post an alternative to Q-pads and Dynamat that has been
&gt;suggested there.  Something that is very similar (if not identical) in
&gt;nature is called Ice-Guard or Ice Dam that is used for roofing.  You can get
&gt;this stuff at Home Despot or the like and it is much more economical when
&gt;considering the scale of a bus.  About $70 for a huge roll (probably enough
&gt;to do 1 1/2 vans).  The people on r.a.c. claim that it smells, feels,
&gt;applies and works about the same as Dynamat and Q-Pads at a fraction of the
&gt;cost.  I cannot vouche for these opinions, but when it comes time to do my
&gt;van I'll be going in that direction.

GRRRRR!!!!!  NO!  I would recommend that you Don't do it and please don't
recommend that anyone else do it either, at least not until you have tried
it personally.

I read a post just like this a couple of years ago and decided to give it a
try.  I spent a lot of time tracking down the stuff and finally bought a
roll of it while I was on vacation up in Canada.  I was VERY DISAPPOINTED
with it.  It has a strong TAR odor and if the sun is out and the
temperature is above 70 degrees, the stuff softens up and RUNS.  It's also
very time-consuming and difficult to remove.

I have *almost* an entire roll left - it's been up in my attic ever since.
If anyone thinks they want to try this stuff out, they can have it for $8
(to buy me lunch) plus the cost of UPS shipping.
