Ok folks here's the deal.

The outpouring of attention to this cause has been amazing.  First I would
like to thank the 20 plus people that have answered this call with either a
monetary pledge or an offer of assistance.  It is amazing how much
comradery this list generates when a fellow traveling bus pilot is
experiencing technical difficulties.

The goal here is to insure that Steve completes his trip around the country
and has time to relax without too much worry or problem.  As I mentioned in
the initital post, &quot;Steve only takes one vacation every two years.&quot;

If Steve gets the bus fixed (hopefully the case) then the money and
assistance pledged will not be necessary and you can store it back for
another &quot;EMERGENCY CALL&quot;.

If by chance the engine does fail him we will need to muster the funds
pledged quickly and send them to a designated person.  That person might be
myself, or someone else able to finance the purchase the needed unit.  I
will let you know as I know.

For now, be on the lookout for a running 2.0 litre engine (preferrebly from
a Vanagon) on the west coast so that we can have one on hand ready to ship
him should he need it.  It might also be good for there to be several
engines specified around different parts of the country.  If he makes it
fine up the West coast who is to say he will make it back to the East
coast.  Let's be prepared no matter where he might encounter problems.

Once again, thanks for the offerings and pledges.  This list is an amazing
thing and does ones spirit good, not to mention our busses.  Keep those
pledges coming and be ready to hit the mail box in a moments notice if the
need presents itself.

If you can't pledge money then say a prayer for our brother on the road.
He is a spiritual man with a good heart.  He works hard for us with his
time, and more money than most on this list know.  He is our brother and
deserves our attention.

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
