&gt; The brakes should be checked every couple of thousand miles.  See any seep, 
&gt; flexible lines cracked, etc.  

Yep but it's that sudden master cylinder failure that'll get you every
time :-)

Also change brake fluid every 2 years.

&gt; 
&gt; Now the questions:  How often should the fuel lines be checked?
&gt; 

Plenty often, more often on FI vehicles.  Ideally replace them every 2
years.

&gt; How does one check the flexible steering coupler?  What does one watch for?
&gt; 

Look at the base of the steering column, you should see a rubber coupler.
Look for cracks, lots of cracks.  I had this happen once on my old '75
Beetle, the coupler didn't break entirely but it came really close.  It is
rubber with what looked like nylon reinforcement strings inside.  When I
finally got to it it was holding together by a couple of those threads.
Symptoms included the steering wheel sticking off center after being
turned, i.e. not returning to center on its own like you would expect.
That was really the only noticeable difference with how it drove.
