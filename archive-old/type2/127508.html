Subject: Re: [T2] re: vdo oil drain temp sender 323-055 vs. 323-888

I read your archive post. I was wondering why you switched from a Gene
Berg dipstick sender to a modified VDO dipstick sender. You indicated
that a fellow listee modified the VDO sender for you in some fashion.
Curious why the GB sender wasn't usable, and what mod's you made to the
VDO one.
Thanks,

&gt; Personally, I concluded that oil temp sump senders don't work very
&gt; well in type1 engines (and only in type4 w/ a special, hard-to-find
&gt; Porche sump plate).  I posted my rationale here:

&gt; sorry for the screwed up format of the post in archives--its my
&gt; fault.
&gt; 
&gt; The basic conclusion was that sump senders in type1 motors are not
&gt; accurate and dipstick senders are much more accurate.  I now use a
&gt; VDO dipstick sender in my van....
