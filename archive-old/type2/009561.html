My dad and I used to camp out all over south western Washington in
several Westies.  The last one was a '77 Overnighter(no pop top). 
In the box next to the ice box, we'd keep a load of good oak, alder
or other hard wood for a fire if the local wood was too wet.  If
you want to use a camp fire to cook, you need good coals which come
&gt;from hard woods.  

One thing we always had stashed away was a supply of Franksenbeans
and other canned food.

I loved camping out in the Westies.  You just pull into some little
nook off of a logging road, make sure the nose is at an &quot;up&quot; incline
and go to sleep.  The only problems with a few of our choices were
when the semis go by at 70 MPH and rattle the camper. &lt;G&gt;

Another nice thing is we were NEVER broken into or trashed, EVER in
20 years of fishing!  Hey, who wants to break into a VW when there's
a $30K rig sitting right next to it?? &lt;G&gt;

Maybe this is getting towards the friday limit?  Nah, it's still all
about our type 2s!

&gt; You can park anywhere on FS or BLM land, no sweat. The only thing is not
&gt; being allowed to build a fire during dry periods unless you're in a regular camp
&gt; site with fire grates.  Although I've never figured out why people want to have a
&gt; bonfire anyway.  I just returned from living in my westy for 4.5 months, never
&gt; built even one fire. What's the point? They don't keep you warm and you can't
&gt; cook very well, and they ruin your nightvision, smoke up your clothes, and it's a
&gt; lot of work gathering enough fuel to keep it going.
