Subject: Re: [T2] '78 battery drain

Hello,

I am not saying that what he charged you for the
starter isn't high, bue marking up the price on parts
is common practice with repair shops. Many shops
charge for labor, mark up on the cost of the parts,
then charge more for profit. I have seen many shops
that refuse to work on your car if you furnish the
parts for them. This is partly so because they cant
garuntee the work and they are unable mark up on your
parts. IT is just how they make their money. I have
seen one shop owner who calculated the cost of labor
by multiplying what he paid the mechanic to fix it by
2. Common practice? I don't know but I still try to
support my local vw mechanic. With out him, I would
loose a major source for parts and resources.
Expensive? Yes. Unfair? Can be. Worth it? Your call. 

Any way, have a great day!

&gt; the shop my bus is at is trying to charge $160 for
&gt; the starter and then some for labor. i guess if i
&gt; was more knowledgeable then i wouldn't be here. it
&gt; sounds simple to check out if you know what you are
&gt; doing, but like anything written by someone that
&gt; knows what they are doing it leaves those that don't
&gt; in the dark. just to me if it starts up with no
&gt; problem when the battery is charged how can it be
&gt; the starter? i read about having the solenoid
&gt; rebuilt. i got no clue and it's a lot of money for
&gt; me. thanx for trying to help me, i appreciate it.
