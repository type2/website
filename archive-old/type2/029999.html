Well, I'd advise against placing them near any heater outlets, or near the

Yup.  I've carried these things around for years inside my various buses.
(and other cars as well..) I usually end up using them on my propane

Wrap them in a blanket or towel and put them in the closet..or whereever

Why not?  Westfalia built propane fired stoves into their campers for

Of course, be sure it is used in a secure and safe place..
