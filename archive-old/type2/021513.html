We use a &quot;Pak-a-Potti&quot; available at Sears, because it is small enough to
fit between the sink cabinet and the jump seat of an early Westy, or
between the front seats of a later Westy, or even between the sink
cabinet and the rear bedseat of a post 75 Westy.  I cut and glued a
piece of 3/16&quot; ply to the top of the potty lift cover ands painted it so
it allows you to use it as a stool.  Then we sewed a cover that matches
the seat material.  Works fine- just dump it into a toilet.  It can be
seen at http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin
which shows all the changes to our 78 Westy like a 3rd bed or roof pod.
