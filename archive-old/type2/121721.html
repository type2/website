&lt;&lt; I wonder if insulating header wrap on the exhaust extractors/J-tubes 
and around the heat exchangers would help mitigate the risk somewhat.  
I've heard that header wrap can be cool enough to touch on the outside 
even when the engine is at full operating temperature.  I think some of 
these wraps are resistant to liquid absorption once cured.

Does anyone out there have experience with this stuff?

Not personally but from another list...The guys who have used header
wrap have been very unhappy with the results...Too much heat re-
tained by the header (cast iron and tubing headers), such that cracks
and expensive replacements were need after about one year of use.
My guess is that header wrap is an idea that moved from the racing
world - where it made sense in reducing underhood temps - to the
boy racer world... YMMV, of course...;-)
