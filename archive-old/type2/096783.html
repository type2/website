Subject: Re: [T2] Getting my 78 Westy &quot;Smogged&quot; in Sacramento   Help needed.

Before you take it to the smog station, have someone do a &quot;Pre-Smog&quot;

if you go to the smog station and they punch in your VIN etc, you are stuck, 
if its a &quot;gross polluter&quot; you may be forced to smog it every year and not 
every 2 years....

So get it checked before you take it in for the official test.....
