Subject: Re: [T2] cost of transmission repairs

Certainly sounds like it.

All the symptoms sound the same as the problems I was having recently,
everyone that knew what they were talking about told me that it was the
clutch cable, half the strands go first, and the rest a bit later.

Sure enough, when I picked up another cable &amp; pulled it, about 2/3 the
strands were gone, the rest would have gone soon after.

Good news is that it's cheap &amp; easy to fix ( I've hardly touched my bus
since I've had her, and I did it no worries ), get a new cable, undo the
butterfly nut on the end of the cable, disconnect it from the clutch pedal
up front, pull it out, slide the new one in &amp; hook it up again, simple as.

Luck,

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I tightened up
&gt; the clutch one time and that gave me the gears back, but half a trip
around
&gt; the block and it was jammed again...  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Might just be the cable is about to snap and is down to a last few
wires...
