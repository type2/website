Subject: Re: [T2] pre-trip mechanic visit

Paul, with a little more practice you can *be* the mechanic for Hapy. :-)

While I admittedly didn't get into things very much when I was there that
day (other than R&amp;R the engine for the clutch), I didn't see anything that
would make me hesitate one bit as far as a trip.  Your lower balljoints 
have torn boots and need to be replaced, but they don't appear to be in
condition to cause a catastrophe.

Change the oil, check/adjust the timing, check the brakes, check the 
condition of your spare tire, adjust the valves if not hyrdaulics -- pull the 
rockers and pushrods on one side, stare down  the tube with a flashlight 
and see if you've got a clip in the lifter; clips *usually* mean hydraulics -- 
and pack spare parts.  Extra coil, cap, rotor, plugs, points &amp; condensor, 
fuel filter, extra couple quarts of oil.  Also pack tools, jack, lugwrench,
cellphone and AAA card.  You should be good to go.

I did a 1700 mile round-trip from Portland to NorCal in May with less of a
going-over than that with no problems at all .. except losing my gascap
in Corning.
