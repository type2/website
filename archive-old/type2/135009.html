read the carb article in our tech section.
http://aircooled_dot_net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/carbs101.htm

best carbs for you are dual 40 IDFs. Do NOT shop on price or you will regret
it. I think the new Kadrons are so bad we do not even sell them. If you want
Kadrons get an old set and rebuild the, the quality is much much better.
