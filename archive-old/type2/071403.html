&lt;&lt; FYI

  I got one of these from Ron and it is nice looking etc. BUT while the
cam comes out like it is supposed to, with a little wiggling I can still
get the gas cap off in the locked position. &gt;&gt;

I suspect that the European Bus had a different gas cap and filler neck than 
the US models.  I don't have access to my parts CDs right now, so I can't 
compare part numbers.  I know that the gas cap and filler neck on my '73 Euro 
Panel is quite a bit different than the one on my '74.  Anyone know for sure?
