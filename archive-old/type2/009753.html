Perry:

If the engine seems to run alright, bring along a compression tester to
check the condition of the engine.  This is one of the best ways to find
out if the engine is alright.

You might ask to see a receipt for the rebuilt engine or for the parts used
to rebuild it.   

Thank you!

 in looking at bus ads in the classifieds, i see a lot of them have very
 recently  rebuilt, new or replaced engines. often these have less than
5000
 miles on them. am i being paranoid, or is this something to be suspicious
 of?
 
 if i look at a bus with a really new or very recently rebuilt engine on
it,
 what kind of warning signs should i look for when test driving it?
