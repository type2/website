Subject: Re: [T2] bus stalls out, longish, please help...

In my experience with vacuum leaks...it isn't a good idea to raise idle to 
fix a vacuum leak...being a daily driver sometimes we gots to do what we gots to 
do. First time hearing this problem...so, does the engine idle? If so, I 
would test for a vacuum leak with starter fluid spraying slightly areas around 
intake gaskets, hoses if idle stumbles you most likely have found the leak. 
Vacuum leaks...hows your brakes?
Booster PRoblems? Check Valve? Do you have any backfire? The line from the 
booster to the Plenum (small rubber elbow) likes to leak, the dashpot or the 
decel valve rather...IF there is a leak there?
Of course this is all assuming you have a vacuum leak...
Just food for thought!
