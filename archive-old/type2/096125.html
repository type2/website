Subject: Re: [T2] drag link is a drag

&gt; I hope everyones weekend was good. I got a lot done on my bus. I 
&gt; replaced the ball joints,tie rods,calipers,rotors,bearings,pads,sway bar
&gt; bushings,steering box,and tried to get the drag link on. I had 
&gt; everything on except the drag link and had done a measure tape alignment.
&gt; I went to put on the drag link but it hits the metal cross member it 
&gt; goes though. When I compare it to the old original one length is the same,
&gt; but the dip in the pipe is in a different spot. It's made by Meyle. Do I 

turn it around !
