Subject: Need advice: re exhaust manifolds

Decided to tackle what I thought was a leaky heater box exhaust pipe, but
on listening (pretty loud, feel puffs), it may be coming from exhaust
manifold in the 78 Type 2 engine?   I pulled the heater box (which I'll
replace, since it has a small hole near flange) and spent a few hours
trying to get off the U-pipe from a spare heater box, - AARRGH- these bolts
were WELDED ON WITH RUST- I didn't want to hurt the flanges, so I hacksawed
off the bolt heads and nuts, and it still held together.  Pounding them out
would have bent the flanges- so I stuck a chisel into the gap where the
gasket is, and it popped apart, with the parts of the bolts still sticking
to the u-pipe.  Then I stuck the exposed ends into the vise and torched the
topside gently and twisted at the same time and they broke loose.  I
checked the nuts on the exhaust manifold; upon trying to loosen one, I
noticed that the stud unscrews from the head
so I retightened it (seemed to turn further, so maybe gasket was loose);
tried the other nut, but felt resistant so I LEFT IT ALONE NOT WANTING TO
BREAK STUD.  NOW, my question is, has anyone had experience getting the
manifold off when there for 17 years!?   Will it unscrew from the head
before it breaks?  I don't want to torch the nuts because of the softer
head metal all around there.     BTW, the u pipes seem to be the same, left
and right, while the manifolds are mirror images??  Any help appreciated;
want to get this legal for the show on the 22nd in West Lebanon, NY!
