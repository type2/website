Subject: Re: [T2] Window support clip broken

The driver's side window on Broomhilda has developed the same problem.

As Steve said, &quot; the 'lift channel' which is press-fit to the base
of the glass.  It comprises of two pieces, which are welded together as
described.&quot;

Well, mine aren't welded together anymore.  I have a jury-rigged arrangement 
with two bolts passed thru the holes in the remaining piece.  These bolts just 
reach under the metal strip at the bottom of the window and support the glass, 
so I can lower the window.  Raising the window requires a steady hand to keep 
the glass horizontal, while the other hand tries to move the crank.

When finances permit, a local mechanic thinks he can install new glass and 
&quot;brass.&quot;  I wonder what shape the other window lift channel is in.

Someone on the list succeeded in having the two parts welded back together.  How 
did he or she protect the glass from the heat of welding?
