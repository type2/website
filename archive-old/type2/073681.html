Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Tune-up's&quot; was:Horsepower question

I have to agree with doing the compression test before the tune-up
starts...without compression, there isn't anything to tune...I've seen
mechanics spend hundreds of the customers dollars on parts trying to
cure a poor running engine after a tune-up without the test first, only
to find one hole down on compression...

Take the 85 Cabrio I bought last spring for a song....the owner was so
frustrated after spending over $1500 trying to cure a backfire, and poor
running he almost begged me to take it away. He nearly fainted when
after asking if he had done a compression test, and looking through his
invoices, had to say it doesn't look like it....we did one together, and
found 0 compression in one, and 50 in another...a new set of rings, and
a rebuilt head later, the engine runs like new...has a new gas tank,
filler neck, fuel pump, fuel distributor, dizzy and who knows what
else...problem was no compression in two holes...

Just my $.02...

Den.
