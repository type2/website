This is new to me to turn a new rotor.......what is the reasoning behind
turning an already machined surface?
To remove more metal??

Not trying to be a SA, but have never heard or seen this.

&gt; &gt; after inspection i noticed that the pad is rubbing the disc every half
&gt; &gt; turn.
&gt; &gt; it does stop when i brake. there is no roar
&gt; &gt; like described, so, it shouldn't be the bearing, but i am having it
&gt; &gt; checked out by a trusted VW mechanic on monday, so we'll see what
&gt; &gt; happens. any advice on how i can seperate the pad, and save some money
&gt; &gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;  I suspect your rotor is warped. Not a cheap prospect. I would say live
with
&gt; it and try to line up a good used one or save for a new one. I think they
are
&gt; in the 70-$80 range new and you will have to have a new or used one
turned.
&gt; (I know, Dr. Tim sez never turn them, but I think for a new or used one it
is
&gt; appropriate), and then the cost to replace it if you can't do it yourself.
