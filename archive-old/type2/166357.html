Subject: Re: Front Wheel Bearing Adjustment

Do it with the wheels able to rotate, so off the ground. That way you 
can spin them a little to assure the bearing is being compressed equally 
after each inward adjustment and check of the thrust washer.

Interestingly I just did this job - on my '87 Porsche 944S - exactly the 
same system.

'82 Vanagon Westy - Megasquirted and bedded down for the winter
'87 Porsche 944S - winter car but not a beater!

&gt; Seems simple enough, however it is not specified if the adjustment
&gt; should be made with the wheels on or off, or with the vehicle raised
&gt; or on the ground. I ended up doing mine with the wheels off (vehicle
&gt; obviously off the ground).
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps it doesn't make a difference. Thoughts?
