IT IS FLUSH WITH THE OUTER EDGE OF THE TRANNY, DON'T PUSH IT ALL THE WAY

&gt; I don't own a Bentley and will buy one soon, but meanwhile, I'm
&gt; experienceing some serious leaking. I have one that drips down the oil
&gt; filter, but it appears tight. I'm wondering if it's the filter housing where
&gt; it attaches to the block. The other is more perplexing because I can't
&gt; figure if it's tranny oil or engine oil. It appears to be coming down from
&gt; inside the auto tranny area where it is open at the bottom, and you can see
&gt; the torqueconverter?? spinning around when the engine runs. It is towards
&gt; the engine side of these openings, and drips about once every 3-4 seconds so
&gt; it's pretty bad. Any thoughts on this??
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney
