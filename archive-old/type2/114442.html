Subject: Dead Battery? Intermitent Fault?  Weekend away in tatters?

Hello


I'm hoping someone out there can help me, I don't use by bus all that often
but do start it ona  regular basis and it has been starting first time no
problem and battery has never given any signs that it is on the way out, On
Sunday I started it no problem.

Last night I went to start the bus (3days later) and the battery was
completely flat with only faint ignition lights.  I tested the battery and
it was down to 10.5V.  I checked to see if there was any power draining from
the battery and couldn't detect anything.

I did notice however that the two leisure battery straps (not connected to a
battery)where touching.  When I tested the two by putting them throu the
tester it showed a reading of 0.10 Amps.  Does anyone know if this may have
been what drained the battery?  It seems unlikely that something so low
would completely drain my battery but do you think that it may have been
draining more when the battery was fully charged?

Failing that does anyone have any suggestion that would prevent my weekend
away being ruined?.

Heres Hoping

Thanks again
Matt
