Subject: my .02$ on heat...

Howdy from Arizona,

I posted my heat solution (portable propane heater) to the list last
spring and it started the same pro/con/flame(no pun intended)
controversy as this current thread.

I have a portable Coleman catalytic heater (propane) that I bought
some 15 years ago specifically for heating a VW bus. It works fine.
I'm not dead.

ANY heat source is a potential problem area. Even electric.

USE COMMON SENSE! We all know about common sense and instinct, or we
wouldn't be able to keep these 30 year old (lovable) beasts on the
road!!!

Another great (but EQUALLY dangerous) source of heat when camping
i.e., stationary, is a Coleman lantern. You would be amazed how much
heat they produce!!!

Just provide adequate ventilation and turn off EVERYTHING before
sleeping. 


PS- I use a pair of SlumberJack sleeping bags that fit nicely in the
bed area and are WAY toasty and only cost $65.00 ea. They also zip
together for one REALLY BIG bag, but it gets TOO hot!!

PPS- If any of you think someone in Arizona doesn't understand the
need for heat, think again! It gets WAY colder here at night than when
I lived in Oregon or Idaho!!!!!


Jaime
