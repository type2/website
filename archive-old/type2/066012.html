Subject: Re: exhaust fumes in heater

Good post -- 'bout the DeadStop.

The reason they sell these for planes is that small planes have your
typical VW-engine-on-steriods hangin' on the front (mine is 360 cubic
inches of 4 cylinder engine!) and they heat the cabins with air ducted
around the exhuast pipe.  Since they travel high, where it's cold, they
use their heaters a bit more.  Since there isn't alot of air to start with,
CO poisoning is even more quickly a problem.  Since you don't just roll to
a gentle stop on the side of the road when the driver keels over dead...

My poor ol' plane is so drafty that I never have peeled the coverof the
couple of DeadStops that I carry.

Real motorhomes (as opposed to those wimpy Rustfalia-Grateful-Dead mobiles)
seem to have real CO detectors in them, much like are sold for household use.
These last much longer than two months.  If they were approved for planes,
I'm sure I couldn't afford one anyway, so I'll stick with the DeadStop.

Since we are on the subject, the high prices at VW seem soooo very tame
when compared with Lycoming or Beechcraft.  Exhaust valves for my engine
are $300.  Each.  A little no-pressure check valve was $250 (identical part,
even same manufacturer -- Allied Signal, to a standard PCV valve that I
bought at Pep Boys for $2).  My engine cost me $10,000 in PARTS to overhaul,
with me doing the work.  Connecting rod bolts $50 each, cam drive gear $400,
Genuine Chevy fuel pump $400, camshaft $1000...

It's funny to think about the viscous-coupling being so expensive when
Cessna wants more for the little &quot;scissors&quot; for the 172's front wheel, and
$5000 for the little fiberglas cowling over the engine.

It could be worse.  Ducati could make planes!
