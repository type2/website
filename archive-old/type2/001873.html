Sounds like a great t-shirt?  Is it available?

Thanks.

&gt; Got back from the Cascade Kombis Club Meeting tonight and am very excited.
&gt; For one thing, the T-shirt design is absolutely incredible.   It was
actually
&gt; done by none other than the inspired Peter Ashwandan, who illustrated the
&gt; Idiot Book.   A bug and a splitty with the Seattle skyline behind them,
the
&gt; Space Needle to the right, and some bits of valve springs and valve and
valve
&gt; adjusting screws on the left.
