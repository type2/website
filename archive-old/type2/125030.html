Subject: Re: [T2] type 1 in a 74

Hello Volks

I also have a 1977 Westfalia (late bay) with T1 engine, since the bus was
produced to be export to Venezuela, the T1 engine is original installed in
it (the M codes said so), in the engine bay the tins are designed to fit
perfectly thanks to a big tin that comes betwen the rear of the engine
comparment and the belt pullie.
I used to have a 1976 Westy California style, I mean 2.0L, FI, A/C, stove,
etc. We have a lot of steep and winding backroads here and the last time we
(a friend of mine who owns the '76 by now and I) hit the road together we
where very close dispite his big engine, but the gearbox of mine (the '77)
was beter adapted to the T1 engine and her perform as a goat, in the highway
there is another story the 2.0L performs very well and I saw the back window
become smaller and smaller.
Having the experience of own the both models my final statement is that both
are great, performs diferent depends of the road, both are funny to drive
and very cool.

Roberto
