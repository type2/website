Now there ya go. If 'we' plan a vacation for one, then we outa just plan a

&gt; &gt; I vote for Glacier National Park and the Tetons and skip Yellowstone.
Have
&gt; &gt; a great time, I'm jealous.
&gt;
&gt; John,
&gt;
&gt; NO! NO!  Don't drop Yellowstone!  *ADD* Glacier and the Tetons!  of
&gt; course, he'll need to  add a week, but hey... since we are planning his
&gt; trip, we can dream, can't  we? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Glacier is one of the few Nat'l Parks in the lower 48 I have not gotten
&gt; to.  Big Bend down in Texas is another.  Both are way out of the way from
&gt; anywhere and supposed to be worth every mile.

&gt; &gt; 6) It would help to get some sort of guide book before going to
&gt; &gt; Yellowstone. Planning is good.
&gt;
&gt; Excellent advice!  more reading is always good.  the more you know before
&gt; you start, the better the trip will be.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 7) Another nice stop nearby is Thermopolis, WY, about 90 miles south of
&gt; &gt; Cody. Thermopolis is the home of the world's largest mineral hot spring.
&gt;
&gt; YES!!!  BTDT!  well worth the effort.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 8) Tensleep Pass (in WY) over the Bighorns is a spectacular drive.
&gt;
&gt; I want to do this one someday very badly.  Again, it has an excellent rep.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 10) The Grand Tetons are really beautiful.
&gt;
&gt; The Grand Tetons are, however, not for people in VW buses :-)  At the very
&gt; least, do *not* be tempted by Rt. 22 coming out!  It is the *steepest*
&gt; road I have ever been on!!!  the SUVs were in 2nd!  I agree that it is
&gt; among the most beautiful places on earth, but it is also among the most
&gt; abrupt.  do it if you want, but an oil temp gauge should be required,
&gt; like chains in the passes in the winter.  No gauge, no go.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 11) Wind Cave National Park has a small campground that costs about
&gt; &gt; $10 a night,and has a resident herd of bison. It's about 6 miles north
&gt; &gt; of Hot Springs, SD, which has a operational woolly mammoth dig that
&gt; &gt; was discovered during excavation of an apartment complex about 25
&gt; &gt; years ago: worth the visit. The caves at Wind Cave and Jewel Cave are
&gt; &gt; both worth visiting.
&gt;
&gt; How did I forget this!?!?!?  A big Amen to David!  What a wonderful
&gt; experience the cave was and the mammoth dig was also incredible.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 14) About reliability: we've had problems each year we've driven out,
&gt; &gt; including the year we took our F*rd Taurus. We're coming close to
&gt; &gt; accepting them as part of the journey.
&gt;
&gt; Yup!  Same here.  At the same time, there is nothing to unite you and your
&gt; bus like changing out a dying clutch cable in the NFS campground above St.
&gt; George, Utah :-)
&gt;
&gt; Which brings up National Forest Service (NFS) campgrounds.... I love them
&gt; and rely on them!  they are marked in most atlases and are cheap and good.
