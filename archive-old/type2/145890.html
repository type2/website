&gt; was the success of the Corvair that led Ford to make the Mustang and
&gt; then to keep up GM
&gt; had to build the Camaro. They couldn't stuff a V-8 in the rear of the
&gt; Corvair and cubic
&gt; inches were everything in the 60's... And the useless ability to do
&gt; burn outs - hard to
&gt; do in rear engine cars without effort - right?
