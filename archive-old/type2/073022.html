&gt;Hey Everyone, I have what may be a silly question but
&gt;better safe than sorry.  Before yesterday my steering

&gt;across it that was in the mostly horizontal position.
&gt;Now, today when getting in it is was more at a 45
&gt;degree angle.  I'm under the impression that this is
&gt;not normal.  The only thing that happened between the
&gt;last time I drove her and today was that my roommate
&gt;moved it out of the driveway so she could get her car
&gt;out.  She didn't notice anything funny happening and
&gt;didn't notice what position the steering wheel was in.

Dear Chrissie,

Please get this checked out and solved before you drive the bus again. We
had similar symptoms with a bus. What happened was that the metal box that
anchors the steering mechanism to the axle beam had begun to rot out,
gradually pulling away from the axle beam. Look under the middle of the
front of the bus, where the steering mechanism attaches to the middle of
the axle beam. Check out how that box is attached to the axle beam (it
should take about a minute). If it releases completely, you can't steer the
bus, which is a bad thing.

The box can be rewelded to the axle beam under certain circumstances.

Please get it checked out, though.

Good luck!
