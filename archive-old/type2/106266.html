Subject: Re: [T2] loose wire??

&gt; Symptoms:  when I make a low speed hard right turn, like in the city or in a
&gt; parking lot, my wipers stop dead, and my headlights go out.
&gt;
&gt; It doesn't happen on a similar left hand turn.
&gt;
&gt; It 'sounds' like a loose wire, but are the wipers and the head lights on the
&gt; same circuit??
&gt;
&gt; No, the VW does not stall...

well the headlights and wipers are both povered from a bk/Y wire from the
ignition switch. Id look there first.&gt;
