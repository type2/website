&gt;Mike,

&gt; I posted a question (see &gt; below) to the Type 2 Mailing List, but only
&gt;got a couple of responses. Neither of them seemed to shed much light on
&gt;the subject, so I thought I'd see if you had any thoughts 
&gt; Thanks for any help you might be able to offer.

&gt;&gt; I have been reading about the wonders of VW's mysterious Oil Bath air 
&gt;&gt;filter which is, by all accounts I have read, far superior to paper or
&gt;foam element types.
&gt;&gt;Why then, do we never see them on engines built larger than the stock
&gt;1600cc?  
&gt;&gt; I guess people feel that the Oil Bath will restrict the airflow to the 
&gt;&gt;larger carb.(probably correct). So, why not use the late model Bus
&gt;(1800-2000cc) Oil
&gt;&gt;Bath? Certainly those engines suck as much air as a big bore Type 1, &gt;and
it seems like it
&gt;&gt;would be pretty easy to adapt one to a larger carb. 
&gt;&gt;  Perhaps it's the Oil Bath filter's homely appearance and lack of 
&gt;&gt;&quot;Chrome Appeal&quot; that make it one of the first parts to be discarded &gt;from
the car. I know
&gt;&gt;they take up a lot of engine compartment space, but it sure seems like
&gt;they serve an important function.   Maybe I'm just missing something
&gt;obvious here, so I'm asking the List: 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  1. Has anyone tried to use a late model Bus Oil Bath on a big bore 
&gt;&gt;(1776, 1835cc, etc..) Type 1 engine? 
&gt;&gt;  2. Do you see any reason why the late Bus Oil Bath would not work &gt;well 
&gt;&gt;on a high performance engine? How about a pair of early Oil Bath &gt;filters
on a dual-carb
&gt;&gt;engine? (Ooo.. a mushroom can on each side of the engine.Cool! 
&gt;&gt;  3. Should we start a High Performance Oil Bath Revolution? Maybe we 
&gt;&gt;could chrome them.....naaah. 
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;  TIA for your thoughts and ideas, 
&gt;&gt;

  I have some thoughts . . but are they relevant ? . . :-)

 First out of the bag, &quot;Can I run a big engine with an oil bath
filter ?&quot;  

 You take any filter you want and test it yourself . .

 Get vacuum gage and hang it off the intake manifold . . anywhere
it will read a vacuum . . sitting at idle and again at XX rpm,
put the filter on and read vac., take it off and read . .

 You are particularly interested in your intermediate rpm,
that's where you spend most of your time . .

 If you want performance, you may want to size your filter for a higher rpm
. . yada yada . . you know the drill . .

 In all cases you are looking for the least amount of increased
vacuum with the filter on . .

 if you're doing an oil bath, you can start pulling oil in at higher
rpm . . it will be apparent . . smoke clouds . . :-)

 WHAT'S THE BEST FILTER? ? 

That's a complex question . . the oil bath lends itself to long 
periods of no maintenance and does a fair job as far as I can tell.

 When I think of &quot;oil baths&quot;, I have this picture of some old
pickup in some &quot;Dustbowl of the World&quot;, dirt roads and wind all the
time . .  weren't too many of those people knew or cared if that 
thing had oil in it or not . .

 I may be fooling myself but they seemed to run forever . . .

 There's a whole post on how oil bath filters work . . check the 
Raistrick site . . .

 Other filters I would look at would be dual stage that off-roaders
use . . K&amp;N Filters . . the expensive ones . . Oberg comes to mind ..
 There's a centrifugal filter &quot;Turbo something&quot; that might be good.

 These are paper or metal mesh or some other filter media than oil.
They are not those little chrome bastards for $12 you bought . .

 They need changing very often . . 


 WHAT THE HELL ARE WE FILTERING . .?  AIR . .? . . . WHY ? . . 

 I wrote this post with all the numbers that says for a gallon of
gas, you had to have some 9000 gallons of air to get stoich . .

 At least that's how I remember it . .

 No . . this is not a ridiculous number . . .

 We are filtering the dirt out of that air . . dust and other types
of abrasives . . . . yes . . abrasives . .  grind your bones stuff

 The dirt in the air is sucked in with the good oxygen/nitrogen mix
that we all need to burn fuel . .

 You look in the throat of your carb . . even the one with the best
filter money can buy and you're going to see it is  polished . .
 That's from abrasives in the air that went thru there . .

 So the filter people do a balancing act between good filtration
and good breathing . . the finer particle the filter stops, the 
more restriction there is per square inch of filter material . .
 Really good filtration would take a filter as big as your muffler
at least . . :-)

 Air filters seem to screen down to about 40 micron . . good ones

 Look at Fleet rigs and stationary engines . . . . engines so 
expensive that they squeeze for every last hour out of said engine.

 They use centifugal and direction changes and oil baths and maybe
ten or eleven 12&quot; dia paper filters in a stack . .

 Out of the question for us and not cost effective . .

 So we need to determine where this vehicle is going, multiplied
by the number of hours we want from the engine, divided by the oil
change interval,(oil in the engine, not the filter) . .
Subtract your shoe size and divide by four . .

 you know you have to have dirt in the air for it to rain .?

 From the above statement I conclude dirt in the air that goes 
in your engine prevents some atomization of the gasoline . .
&quot;Degradation of the Flame Propogation&quot; . . bad stuff . . :-)

 This dirt ends up going out the exhaust but some percentage gets
by the rings and ends up in your engine oil . .
 Picked up by your valve stems and wears out the guides . .
Wears out the throttle shafts in your carby . .

 If you have 5-10% blow-by on your rings, then we can assume 5-10%
of the grit got by the rings with that exhaust . .

 Off-roaders use paper and such filters with oil soaked foam and 
change the filter every time they get gas . .

 So you aren't an off-roader . . did you drive alongside off-road?
Then you got the same kind of dirt . .

 Dirt is made out of rocks you know, or is it vice versa . .? :-)

 Say you're running the dunes this week-end . . lot of sand in the 
air . .  10% gets by your filters and is in the oil . .

 So if you're an optomist, you say the grit is &quot;polishing&quot; your
engine . . if you're a pessimist you say it's &quot;destroying&quot; . . .
Sand is what they make &quot;sandpaper&quot; out of  . . &quot;clean dirt&quot; . .

 Bottom line: filtration of the air is very important to long life of an
engine . . you need the best you can get . .

 I think the oil-bath with all the engine seals and no open trunk lids
etc. . is the least you can live with . .

 For better filtration, I would go to paper and oil-soaked foam etc.,
all of which is &quot;high maintenance&quot; . . ie. changed often . .

 Be a pessimist when buying filters . . find out the specs for 
filtration for your particular filter . . ie 50 micron . .
get the best you can that isn't too restrictive . .

Someone is going to ask &quot;well why did the manufacturers go to paper
filters? &quot;  Because the filter people give them the design work
and the filter for free . . and if you change them as specified 
in the manual, they do a fairly good job too . .

 There was the deal about oil in the intake when you are trying to
get smog compliant . . like, this would increase the hydrocarbons.


 In conclusion . . I was reading this book and they referred to a 
&quot;kubelblitz&quot; . .  anyone care to translate? 
 Until I hear otherwise, I define it as your hair's on fire and you
just stepped in a bucket . .  :-)
