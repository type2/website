&lt;&lt; Bus engines get 15-20mpg, depending on how well they're running.  Not

I've been led to believe that a CDI ignition can improve mileage.

Isn't this part of the reason VW was forced to drop the air-cooled
engines (in areas that care about breathing, at least...?-)
High MPG ratings for two liter engines are usually the result of a
couple factors...Mostly lighter vehicles ( nothing here for the Bus,
unless you replace all the steel with alloy), overdrive trannies, and
lean burning engines...Lean is destructive to an air-cooled engine...
A water cooled engine can compensate for the extra heat, a stock
air cooled can't...
