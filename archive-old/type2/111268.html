&gt; What motor came stock in a '71 Deluxe? It has a 1600 in it and I am not sure

&gt; mine and I don't know anything else about it.

The '71 was the only year to come with a 1600DP.  If your intake manifold
has cast aluminum ends going into the heads you have a DP engine.

PICT is the solex designation for a carb.  You can find it on the left
side of the float bowl.  Most Solex carbs are PICT.  Older ones can be
PCI, etc, as well as the dual carbs.
