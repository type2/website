 Hi Abraham &amp; List 

&gt; the pump doesn't  work anymore, and when I took it apart I found that a
gasket inside it
&gt;which opens on the up strokes and closes on the down strokes

	I was lucky enough to find a westy sink/ice box unit in a junked bus of
approximately the correct vintage ('73) ie the veneer matches. It has a chrome
hand pump with black plastic guts.
	I found a replacement washer at a plumbing supply store that specializes in
repair parts for fixtures made before &quot;throw it away and get another piece of
junk&quot; was SOP. It's sort of like a squashed &quot;O&quot; rig. When Brisco sits awhile I
have to suck on the nozzle to prime it , much to the amusement of onlookers,
otherwise it works fine. Reduce, reuse, recycle AND repair.
											 Yours, Rob
