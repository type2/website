Subject: easiest way to straighten front end/ hit deer

ok the subject tells it all. i hit a deer today with my 71 im sad. 
anyway does anyone have some suggestions on a good way to fix the dent.  
it is the front passenger side from right below the windsheild to right 
above the bumper and over to about the middle of the nose. i do have a 
parts bus with a decent front end.  and i have access to a tig welder. 
would that be a better option to weld in a new peice or should i weld a 
rod to the outside and try and pull the dents out. no idea here really. 
dont want to go out and buy a dent puller or drill holes and would like 
to keep the bondo at a minimum. thanks   -doug
