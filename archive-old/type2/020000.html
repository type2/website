Subject: Bus Aprasial and Friday topic

Have any of you been involved in a wreck recently where there was damage
and had to get your bus appraised?

Since I only had Liability when I was involved in the accident Monday I
probably will have to fix it myself, but I would like
to get tan Idea of how much the Insurance Company would value a 72
Restored Westy Camper. I understand that this value
is different than say Kelly Blue book value, any one know?

When the appraiser came to look at my bus a few moments ago he said, &quot; I
was expecting a 72 Volkswagen Bus and was
wondering why any one would be worried about damage to one of those,
then I saw yours, very nice, it looks new, I
understand why you want to repair it.&quot; I wonder if that's how the cop
felt, oh it's just an old vw.

Friday Topic

Has any one ever thought about the huge resource of knowledge out side
of VW's that this list must have?
Could we tap into it somehow, like I need some &quot;Legal&quot; advice about my
wreck, someone might be a lawyer and wouldn't mind
sharing some info with me, they might even need help with advice on how
to make their Christmas Family Video turn out
better this year, in which I can help since I have been producing videos
for 18 years.

Any one want to start a BARTER sight for information?

I hope to have some photos posted soon of the damage to Hoss, of course
everyone that has seen it tells me it's not as bad as
I had made it out to be, IT JUST SEAMED HUGE TO ME MONDAY!

I hope everyone has a great weekend.

Meredith
