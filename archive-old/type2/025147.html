So, what are you saying is that the life expectancy of a type I is about
62,500? Seems kind of low to me for any motor as a matter of fact. And on
the other extreme, I think 625,000 sounds far fetched...now if you were
talking a japanese motor I might see it...I guess my question is: what kind
of return can one expect if they take care a type I? I know what John Muir
states in his book but, let's here it from the folks on the list as well.

Thank You,

625K? Whoa! That's about 10 type 1's! Can you tell us any more about it?
Of course, a 2 liter has a lot easier life in a  912E!  A lot less time at
full
throttle.
