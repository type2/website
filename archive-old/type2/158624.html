Subject: Re: [T2] distributor drive gear removal

sorry everyone.   i am very sorry. i did not mean to offend.  i am working
on a 78 transporter with a 2.0 l fuel injected.   the advice joe gave me
with the wooden dowel was the trick.  i just happened to have some 5/16
wooden dowel around the house,   i cut about a foot of it and hammered it in
the void and viola.   out comes the gear.  thank you very much joe, and mark
again i get in a hueey sometimes and forget the details.   i hope in the
future i remember my manners.  thenk you too mark

&gt; what are you guys opinions onthe best wa yto remove the distibutor drive
&gt; gear?   i have a 16 pound magnet, that gets it about half way.  i have
&gt; tried
&gt; a couple of different ways and none of my ideas are working.   please help
&gt; me out here.   anyone in the athens georgia area out there.  i am having a
&gt; devil of a time.
&gt;
&gt;  hello ???      first tell us what we are working on, what year, type
&gt; motor etc.  Type 1 motors you have to remove the fuel pump and stand.  I
&gt; have used pencials. screwdrivers, metal rods and blind pullers that were
&gt; made for this.  You will have to twist the drive as you pull it up. remember
&gt; that there are washers on the bottom of the drive itself and they can fall
&gt; off . last sign your posts as a courtesy and so we know who we are
&gt; addresting later  mark Dearing
