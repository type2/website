Subject: RE: [T2] Cold Start Valve wiring... and more

Keyswitch &quot;ON&quot; Stick finger or screwdriver handle into
AFM. No pump? No fuel flow? Got Gas? 
If the pump doesn't run when you do this, there is a
reason the pump isn't running. Head for that obstacle
and solve. If the pump runs, but fuel doesn't return
to the tank, there is an obstruction. If the pump
runs, you can loosen the fuel rail pressure check
fitting between #3 &amp; #4 cyls and (be sure to wrap a
rag to catch the fuel if any)see if any fuel comes out
there. Be careful cuz if there is no obstruction, the
gasoline should be under about 30psi pressure and if
there IS an obstruction, it could be over 100psi
easily!

Keep in mind that the cold start injector runs off the
same fuel pressure and flow as everyone else. If IT
works, then THEY should work. If the pump isn't
running, none of 'em will work!
