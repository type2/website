Subject: Re: Broken axle stub on '81 Westy

&gt; Dan,
&gt; 
&gt; According to Bently pg.42.4 and 42.5, it appears that from the back side
&gt; the brake backing plate is held in place by one bolt (13mm) and is held
&gt; in alinement by one locating pin (dowel pin). After you take the drum
&gt; off, you'll see that there are two bolts (?mm) that hold it the backing
&gt; plate to the wheelbearing housing. Once these three bolts are removed,
&gt; whats left should fall apart. Good luck!
&gt; 
Tyrone,

I got all the bolts off.  The only thing left is that troublesome locating
pin (dowel pin).  I've been following the instructions in the Hayes manual
and it mentioned that the dowel may be tight and it might be necessary to
work it off with a screwdriver...but, man, is it really tight!  I'm really
having a tough time getting it out of the brake backing plate.  My backing
plate is already dented out of shape but I don't want to bust the dowel
pin.  Any suggestions?
