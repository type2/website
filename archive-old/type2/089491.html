Subject: Re: [T2] green wire on voltage regulator


&gt; Only wire I see green is the DF (field winding) between the alt - reg.
&gt; Have you traced the wires that are hooked up?
&gt;
&gt; Red     D+ (output of alt) to reg
&gt; Grn     DF (field winding of alt) to reg
&gt; brn     D- (low side of alt) to reg
&gt; blue    regulator to the dash alt lamp.
&gt;
&gt; If the DF is just dangling is the output voltage of the alt right?
&gt; ~13-14v when engine running. low is not charging and too high is bad.
&gt; If the alt is running right and the wiring is obviously wrong then is it
&gt; the original type alt and reg setup? Is it possibly a diff alt with
&gt; internal regulator or some bastardized setup? Dont trust the DPO (dreaded
&gt; previous owner) they are capable of anything. :)

Andy,

I have not traced the wires really.  I followed the other three the other
day and saw that they were hooked up to something (did not really look that
hard) and found that the only one not hooked up was the green.  My engine is
out of a 72.  As far as I can tell, everything looks stock.  Where are the
alt. connections that I need to chcek.  I will check them out tonight while
I am fixing a fuel leak. I suppose that this could account for the fact that
before I had the engine swapped out, the battery was fine, but after ---
dead after about a week of messing around with it.

-Tom
