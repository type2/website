Subject: Removing  rear brake drums

I had the same problem.  I finally ressorted to beating them with a hammer as
I turned the drums.  Beat awhile, them try to work off by hand. Repeat the
process as necessary.  I began with a few timid taps and finally worked up to
a pretty good lick.  They finally came.
