Subject: steering rack boot

Hi all,

    I have to replace one of my steering rack boots on my 82 westy.  I am
not sure but it looks like the tie rod end has to come off to do this.  Am I
correct?  Is there a different way?  Also, I am not sure how long it has
been ripped.  Do I need to put grease back in &amp; what kind?  There is no
grease all over the area so I figure either the grease is still in there or
it has all leaked out a long time ago.  For the record, it is steering fine.
