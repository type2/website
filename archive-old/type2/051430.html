Subject: [T2] WTB transxle for 86 later Vanagon

List:
The subject says most of it, I want to buy a transaxle for an 86 or
later Vanagon, manual 4 speed type 091/1.
I'd definitely consider one that is broken or nonfunctional in some way,
but please not one that has been run dry.
I'd also consider a South African 5 speed if available (slim chance of
that, I realize.)
