&gt; 
&gt; &gt; that designation is off by about ten years, isn't it?  What I want to

&gt; Only designation that State Farm had for my '74 Campmobile was &quot;Kombi&quot;

Actually, that's what it started life as before it's detour to Westfalia
Works. Your serial number should start 234- with the 23 standing for
Kombi, 4 referring to the year 74.
