Subject: Missing Distributor Spring

Fellow bussers,
I'm a long time luker, first time poster.
I've got a 69 Westy, and I removed my stock vacuum distribtor yesterday in
anticipation of getting a new 009 from BusDepot tomorrow.  I was alittle
bored this morning and I decided to see if I was smart enough re-install it
and still have everything work properly, before I go throwing new parts in
it.
I got the thing back in, and I was setting the timing, just for fun, when I
when to check the advance, and poof!  Engine died. hmmmmm.
I discoved that the distributor shaft came away from its drive gear.  Hmmmm.
I also noticed the dizzy shaft has about 3-4mm of play up and down, thus
when the RPM's increase, the shaft goes up, engine dies.
I've been reading about a spring that should be dropped into the hole on the
crankcase before the dizzy goes in, but I don't recall every seeing a spring
while removing the dizzy.  And, wouldn't a spring in there just push the
dizzy shaft up, thus continuously dis-engaging the shaft from the drive gear
anyway.  I'm puzzled.
Also, if I have lost the &quot;spring&quot; where can I get another?  I haven't seen
any in a catalog anywhere, or will it (hopefully) come w/ a new 009?
thanks
brian
69 Westy!
