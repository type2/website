Subject: Re: [T2] Gas and lights

This brings to mind a question I had about running original VW intake valves
with regular gas in a 36hp motor. IF I remember right I have read that any
vw running stock valves produced since 67 or 68 where fine, or that   the
newer aftermarket valves where fine.  When I ordered valves from bfy  the
exaust valves looked good but the intakes looked to be of marginal quality
and I had three different brands between the 4 valves. It was recomended
that I run the ones that where in the motor in place of them as they still
looked to be in decent condition once they where cleaned up. But now I
wonder about compatability with unleaded fuels

&gt; &gt; Its been awhile since I've posted. I've been out of the country for a
while
&gt; &gt; and just got back home and to my camper. Before I left I had the engine
on my
&gt; &gt; 71 westy rebuilt and she was running great. I knew it was running a bit
hot,
&gt; &gt; but I was at that mark to have the valves readjusted and did that
yesterday.
&gt; &gt; I was just wondering if I should have been using a lead additive in my
gas
&gt; &gt; this past hundred miles or so.
&gt;
&gt; Nope.  No VW engine built since the 50s requires lead.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The rebuild is fresh, and I used no lead
&gt; &gt; additive. I was once told if you rebuild, you can get away with a low
octane
&gt; &gt; unleaded fuel, but I'd like the wisdom of the list members.
&gt;
&gt; See what I just posted for Matty.  87 octane below 5,000' with stock dist
&gt; and timing is fine for stock engines
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, before I left I noticed my headlights were running dim, so I
removed my
&gt; &gt; housings and reground all the lights, replaced the fuses. Now I have
bigger
&gt; &gt; problems. My headlights come on when I start the bus. My turn signals
work
&gt; &gt; when they want to. My brake lights don't come on when the pedal is
pressed,
&gt; &gt; but I have rear lights. No reverse lights at all, under any
circumstances. I
&gt; &gt; looked in the archives, but found nothing useful to me. How did I screw
this
&gt; &gt; up?
&gt;
&gt; Melissa,
&gt;
&gt; Each of these lights is on a separate circuit and each will have to be
&gt; checked separately, but the general  rule is to get a VOM, turn the dial
&gt; to 12VDC, attach the black probe to the body (ground), then start probing
&gt; with the red, start at the battery and go 'til you stop seeing 12VDC.
&gt;
&gt; For the reverse lights:
&gt;
&gt; The reverse lights take power from the coil, run it thru an inline fuse in
&gt; the engine compartment down to a switch on the left forward side of the
&gt; transmission and then back to the bulbs in their holders.   From the bulbs
&gt; it then goes to a ground on the body.  OK?
&gt;
&gt; First, take the black wire of your VOM and attach it firmly to some shiny
&gt; piece of metal in your engine compartment.
&gt;
&gt; Take the red probe and touch it to the positive terminal of the battery.
&gt; Got juice?  If it does not read ~12V, then the black wire is not attached
&gt; correctly.  wiggle it a bit until you get a positive 12V when you touch
&gt; the + terminal of the battery.
&gt;
&gt; Turn the bus on, but don't start it.
&gt;
&gt; Touch the red wire of the VOM to terminal 15 of the coil, the one with the
&gt; black wires (*not* the one with the green wire to the dist).  It should
&gt; read ~12V.  Yes?  If it does not, then the bus won't start/run.  If it
&gt; does read 12V, fine.
&gt;
&gt; Now look at the black wires attached to the coil.  One of them runs toward
&gt; the front of the car and has an inline fuse holder built in.  See it?
&gt; Take the fuse holder appart, inspect the fuse and test for 12V on  the
&gt; coil side of the holder.
&gt;
&gt; Insert the fuse in the holder and test for 12V on the exposed end of the
&gt; fuse.
&gt;
&gt; Close the holder and crawl under the bus.  On the forward end of the
&gt; transmission, left side, near the nose cone is a switch with two wires
&gt; coming off it.  Pull these wires off and test both for 12V.  One will and
&gt; one will not have 12V.
&gt;
&gt; put the wire that had 12V back on the switch and check that it still has
&gt; 12V.  Check the other terminal and see if it has 12V.  crawl out from
&gt; under, go up frront and shift the bus into reverse.  Back under and check
&gt; the switch.  at this point *both* terminals of the switch should have 12V.
&gt;
&gt; Go back to the tail lamp housings and check for 12V on the lowest bulb
&gt; socket.
&gt;
&gt; Somewhere in there, you are going to find a break, when you do, fix the
&gt; break and your lights will work, honest!  The same thing has to be done
&gt; for each circuit, headlights, turn signals, brake lights, etc.  It all
&gt; works the sme way, power flows from the battery, thru a fuse, thru a
&gt; switch, to the device, and on to ground.  Get the wiring diagram from
&gt; vintagebus_dot_com or in your Bentley's and have at it!
