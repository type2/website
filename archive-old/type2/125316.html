Subject: fuel line hoses

I am perplexed at what to do about my fuel line hoses.

I look at them and they are dry, not cracking and actually look like there is
nothing wrong with them.

To be honest, they look better than any fuel line I have seen in recent years.
They are rubber with a cloth covering. There are no cracks or bulges anywhere
at the ends or in the runs of the line.

Do I still have to replace them, just because they are likely 30 years old.
They may have been replaced by a PO, but I have generally found things to be
factory on this bus.

It is a 1978 CDN Type 2 Campmobile.

If I disturb things, It is my fear that I will end up with a not perfect
clamp, or some other fault. I am told by my mechanic, who has worked on the
busses for years to watch for cracking or wetness.

In my opinion, using the axiom &quot;The enemy of Good, is Better&quot; applys here.

Some one talk me out of this, Please, I am having a terrible time talking
myself out of it. ;-)

Alan
