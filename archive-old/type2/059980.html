No, he won't.  Please understand that if you send an unsubscribe message
to the list, then you get put on the &quot;reject&quot; list.  No if's and's or
but's.  Every message propogated by this server has the instructions for
unsubscribing appended to the bottom of the message.  *Please* read them!
