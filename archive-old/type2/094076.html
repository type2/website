Subject: Re: [T2] The Woes of the Fuel Filter Change

&gt; Can anyone tell me a way to change my fuel filter without getting a full

&gt; the jobs one has to do on a bus, I dislike this one the most.  Nothing I use
&gt; ever closes that line completely shut, and I always end up soaked in gas -
&gt; every time.  Plus, the fact that there is so little arm room under there (I
&gt; don't jack up the bus for this) makes it hard to manuever and get outta the
&gt; way in the first place.  I'd sure like to know of a better way, because I am
&gt; tired of waiting months for my clothes to not smell like gas anymore after
&gt; each filter change.  Thanks!

You can get it down to a fine art.  I built a simple ramp out of wood and
carried it with me at all time so I could drive a rear wheel up on it.

First, do it with the tank almost empty.  Get a $2 plastic pump from pep
boys if you don't feel like driving around first.

I've found a pair of yellow rubber dish gloves works well with a long
sleeved work shirt.  My dad got gas all over his arms once as it ran down
and his skin flaked and turn red for a couple of weeks.

I think these fuel hose clamps are safer than vise-grips...

...they can be had for less money also.
