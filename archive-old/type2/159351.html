Subject: Re: [T2] Popping out of first

&gt; Most air-coolers use &quot;VWs for Dummies&quot; and
&gt; thae Haynes manual.

Well, I gotta take exception here...  If you are only going to have ONE
manual, it's Bentley.  Then the idiot book - though it's less useful for
the later years but a psychic boost...  THEN maybe the others - haynes,
chilton, vw for dummies...  And for serious folk, that tom wilson
rebuild book that I don't have YET...  From there you can start
collecting documentation on FI and other systems...

I've got a Haynes.  I think it's pretty useless.
