For your 68 bus engine you can use any upright beetle
or bus engine and it is a straight forward bolt-on
installation.  So yes, you could use anything from a
1200 to a 1600 engine with no modifications other than
attaching the engine hanger bar if it is a bug engine.
My suggestion, 1600 DP engine. They seem to be
relatively easy to find both new and used.
