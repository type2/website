Subject: testing fuel sender

How do you use an electric tester to check a fuel sender that is out of the 
tank and the the bus is all disconnected. What exactly do you use on the 
tester, I have no book explaining how to use a tester. What are the ohm 
settings or how to use a voltmeter. thanks for help.
