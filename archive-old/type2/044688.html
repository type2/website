Subject: [T2] doormobile-tents??

my 69 doormobile has three &quot;hooks&quot; above the slider and i am wondering if it 
would have had a tent originally? it is slightly different than most other 
doormers i have seen as it has an so-44 camper, and it pops the oposite way 
of most i've seen, so the hooks are on the side opposite the hinges, and are 
above the slider(pass) i think it was delivered in germany or somewhere in 
europe or canada, and has an alluminum badge written in german under the 
pass. door. anyway if anyone else has a similar bus i would love whatever 
kind of info i can get, one other thing unusual is that the spare tire lays 
down under the front 1/3 2/3 seats in a horizontal position.
anyway just collecting info, i will probably drive it to san jose this 
weekend
cool
zac
