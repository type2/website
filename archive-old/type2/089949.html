Does it have fire?  Got all your wires hooked back up

&gt; Quick Recap:
&gt; Pulled engine and replaced cluth. Put engine back in, and it=20
&gt; wouldn't start.=20
&gt; There was no gas getting to the carb (which should be, but=20
&gt; isn't an FI=20
&gt; system thanks to PO). Replace fuel filter. Now, carb is=20
&gt; getting gas, engine=20
&gt; cranks, but won't start.
