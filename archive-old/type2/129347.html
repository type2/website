Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuilt 2.0 FI - worst case scenario

Hello George:

When I bought my rebuilt 2.0L  I had a similar problem. I had a stock 
working FI system with only 49K on it and no modifications that ran fine 
on the old engine. And when I put all the hoses, air distributor etc. 
together I made sure that nothing was leaking and that it would hold 
vacuum. But still the engine ran poorly, had low vacuum (10 inHg or 
less) and my timing was way off.

I verified that the distributor gear was correctly installed and not off 
1 tooth. I was convinced that the builder had put the cam in wrong. I 
called the builder up and his suggestion was that I fiddle with the set 
point (tension and position of the variable resistor arm) in my AFM. I 
did not like this suggestion and wanted to prove that everything was ok, 
before messing with my AFM or returning the engine.

What I did was create a pulley timing gage to tape onto the pulley, 
removed #3 valve rockers, and created a fixture that would allow my dial 
gauge to measure the lobe height versus rotation angle. I then measured 
the curve for my  cam and compared it to what information I had for a 
new CB performance cam and what I could find for the stock cam.  From 
what I could tell using an old cam, crank and case, if the cam was off 1 
tooth, it would be noticeable on my rough cam timing results.

If you want to read the complete discussion on the Shoptalk forums go to 
this link

&lt;http://www.shoptalkforums_dot_com/viewtopic.php?t=62076&amp;highlight=&gt;) to see 
my timing results.

Anyway, in the end I did have to modify the AFM to get vacuum up and the 
engine to run near normal. I figure that the cam (since it was reground) 
did not allow the heads to breath as well. Plus I found that by running 
my hydraulic lifters at 0.006&quot; that this would also improve my results.

&gt; My new worst case scenario theory:
&gt; Somehow I managed to install the cam one tooth off of the correct 
&gt; alignment with the crank, so valve timing is off.  This could explain 
&gt; propensity to run OK at high rpm (valve timing advanced from stock), 
&gt; and possibly the no vacuum condition, no?
&gt;
&gt; Questions:
&gt; What have I missed?   I could do wire by wire continuity checks as per 
&gt; Bentley but given the good spark, fuel and ignition timing could it 
&gt; still be someting like that?
&gt;
&gt; How can I check *absolutely* that my valve timing is off (by only one 
&gt; tooth?) before investing in a new teardown?
