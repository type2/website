Subject: Re: [T2] 009 question (a new one this time)

Muir makes mention that VW dealers offered the a fully mechanical 
dizzy as an option on sport model type 1s,  Maybe they would fit one 
to a bus. I am also not sure what year the first 009 was produced. In 
fact I am not sure that it was produced for a VW. Perhaps it was for 
a Porche.  It has been sometime since 009 were made in Germany. If 
his was made in Brazil then.......Also no telling what a mechanic 
might have done to that bus over a 30 year period.

In fact why would they produce a dizzy that waited so long to advance?
