Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Turn Signals

New to you bus or new problem on a vehicle you've had for soem time? 

Check the ground at the rear lights. Sounds like maybe the grounds are backwards... 

Got the battery installed backwards? Done this on an Austin-Healy (positive earth). Everything worked perfectly but the tachometer and radio (I think - radio was stinko when it worked). Didn't know until we stopped to jump start an identical Healey and realized the mistake. 

Chris
