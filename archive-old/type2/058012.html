&gt;I haven't been across the border in years, and then I didn't look like a

&gt;VW driving friek.

You will most likely have more problems getting back into the US than out.
&gt;From the description that you just gave, you can expect to have your
vehicle search by at the least U.S. Customs.  They will tear your vehicle
apart, and leave the pieces lying on the road.  Canadian Customs may
search, but from previous reports, they will attempt to put back what they
take out.  The hemp clothing will set off the drug sniffing dogs, you are
better off leaving that at home.  If you have had controlled substances in
the vehicle at any time, you should thoroughly search the vehicle for any
trace of it.  If the dogs smell it, customs then will tear your vehicle all
the way down to find it.

This may sound extreme, but it does happen.  The more you as the potential
tourist, can do to alleviate the suspicion that driving a VW bus creates in
just the local law enforcement, let alone a customs officer, the better off
you will be during border crossings.

Just my $.02

Those who have done border crossings more than I have, I haven't done all
that many, will be able to give better, and possibly more detailed
information.

Cheers,
