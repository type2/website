It sounds to me that the '78 auto bus that you are deciding whether or not
to part out runs better than some of the busses other list members use for
daily drives (myself included in the past &quot;knock on wood&quot;).  If the body and
all on the bus is in good shape, fix that engine.  If it runs at all it has
some potential (I guess).  Maybe you are from the west where the busses are
plentiful but here in the north east, it is hard to find a bus.  Of course
if the body is shot than parting it out may not be a bad option. 
Just my opinion,

'77 westy (used to show some of the same symptoms)
