Subject: Re: [T2] engine rebuild kits, or pieces parts

Zizisjgb_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; Hello again everyone, Bus Gypsy here. I posted a question not too long ago
&gt; about an engine kit. I will rebuild my engine myself but need some advice.
&gt; May go with 1776. Found a rebuild kit online and the price was good. However,
&gt; it was from GEX and I have heard some nasty things about this company. Does
&gt; anyone know any other company that sells such kits, or should I piece it
&gt; together ?   Any info on the dependability of a 1776 would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.  B.t.w.  I am from Brattleboro Vermont. Thank you for your time.

Piece it together is my preference. Call one of the dealers that frequents
this list (aircooled_dot_net, Bus Depot, BustedBus, BusBoys--there are others),
tell 'em you're building a 1776, which is a good reliable mild performance
engine, and they'll fix you right up.

Step 1 is to find a machinist. The stock cylinder spigots are for 85.5mm
P&amp;Cs; a 1776 uses 90.5mm P&amp;Cs and the case &amp; heads need to be machined to
take the larger parts.
