Subject: Westy in Purcellville VA. &amp; Bus Depot
Message-ID: &lt;82f9453d.24644319_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

On my way home from work yesterday I spotted a Westy in Purcellville, I live 
in Round Hill, about 5 miles west of P-ville. Tried to catch up with the 
driver but could'nt, thats a long story in itself that I won't go into. 
Appearedto be a Champagne edition, white on top, brown on bottom, chrome 
bumpers, temp. W. VA. tags. Anybody on the list? Funny thing was the day 
before my 6 yr daughter came in the house screaming she had just seen a brown 
camper go down the street in front of our house. She thinks every VW bus is a 
camper so I did'nt think much of it. As for the Bus Depot, I've had minor 
problems in the past, in fact have one now. Placed an order a couple of weeks 
ago, Dan called back the next day just to clarify something, it took ME two 
days to get back to him. Once I did, the order arrived the next day. Minor 
problem: I ordered 4 pushrod tubes and seals, got 8 small seals, not 4 large, 
4 small as ordered. Big deal, already called and got it straightened out, 
granted my Westy is'nt my daily driver, and its not down waiting for parts. 
But, I still like the Bus Depot, will continue to do business with them. 
Hell, I too, wish I could be in a VW based business of my own! But, years ago 
when I owned a boat, I was standing in the yard of the marina I kept it 
at,said to another boat owner, &quot;Would'nt it be great to own a marina?&quot; The 
owner of the marina overheard what I said and burst out laughing. He said &quot; 
Owning a marina and enjoying boats are two different things. The only time I 
get out on a boat now is when I have to tow one in!&quot;     Jeff S.
