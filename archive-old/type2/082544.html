I have a set of S. Korean tires on my bus but labled YKS brand. model
sv-820. they have been good tires for a while (just under 10,000
miles). It might be the same (or similar) tire. I went w/ these
because they were in stock &amp; fit my price range. I believe I spent
about $45/tire. These are the tires my local tire shop puts on the
rural mail carrier vehicles, so they can't be toooo bad. If needed I
can shoot a picture so you can see what they look like.
