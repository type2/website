&gt;Am I the only one who drives like I've been pithed? Do most of you
&gt;folks &quot;baby&quot; your rigs, never coming near red-line, for any reason? Never
&gt;exceed 60mph? Now I'm very curious...

I have a '71 Bus with an engine that I guess could be described as
blueprinted.  It's stock displacement and cam.  I've smoothed out the ports
and done a little balancing, matching of rod and piston weights, etc.  I
have lowered the compression ratio to about 7:1 and carefully matched all
the combustion chamber volumes.  It also has a progressive Holly/Weber, 009,
and dual quiet pack.  I'm running 195/70 tires which result in about a 10%
gear ratio reduction.  I drive it wide open a lot.  Normal cruising speed is
about 5-10 mph over the posted speed limit.  But often faster if possible
and safe.  I mean physically safe as well as safe from tickets.  Needless to
say, slight hills provide an organic speed limiter so frequently I'm at full
throttle for mile after mile.  Here in Texas there aren't many hills but
when driving a bus you notice even the little ones.  I also often pull a
trailer.  Sometimes it's just a light sail boat but I also have a 2-wheel
flatbed that's just right to carry a small car.  One time I had all my tools
in a covered trailer and the inside of the bus was loaded completely full of
household stuff.  The roofrack contained the removed center seat, lawn
mower, trash cans, etc.  You get the idea.  There's no telling what the
gross weight was, and the wind resistance must have been awfully high as
well.  She made the trip, about 250 miles, just fine, full throttle most of
the way.  There was absolutely no danger of getting a speeding ticket on
that trip.  My point is:  If you build a good engine, don't stress it with
an unrealistic compression ratio and keep the rpm up, a bus will withstand
high speed or heavy loads just fine.  Everything in the engine is important
but I think the key is the lowered compression ratio.
