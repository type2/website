Well.....

Yesterday I got a close look at the engine of a water-cooled Vanagon shortly 
after it chucked #3 rod and piston.  A very scary (and expensive) looking pile 
of shrapnel.  

The entire left front portion of the crankcase is missing, and the rod is 
wrapped around what's left of the mangled and broken crankshaft.  The #3 
cylinder is all broken up and missing a bunch of its mass.  The explosion was 
so forceful that the underside of the engine hatch is damaged and much of the 
FI and emission control systems are destroyed.

I don't know the circumstances at the time of failure as the vehicle was towed 
in sans owner, but all the visible damage was on the top of the engine.  This 
was a very clean and well maintained van with less than 80,000 miles.

Ironically, sitting right next to the dead Vanagon was another wasserboxer 
Vanagon with over 200,000 miles on the original engine.  It was in for a 
routine service prior to a major cross country trip.  The engine is very 
healthy and strong but the van looks as if it'd been used to pull a plow 
through muddy fields.  It's all rusty and beat up and the interior is trashed.

Go figure.....
