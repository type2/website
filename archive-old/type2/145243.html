Subject: HELP with pinging

Hello all.

Im asking help from all of you cause i just cant seem
to get something right.......I have a thing with a
dual port 1600 engine.......and i would drive it for
awhile and then it would start pinging really
bad.........so i fiddled with the timing and tried to
set it where it needs to be but even cold......the
pinging never goes away. I got one of those electroic
kits that replaces the points and put it in.......and
no change. would my next step be the carb???? and
would excessive amounts of gas going into the carb
cause that??? or the opposite?? I havent messed with
overhauling the carb yet.....i just needed some
advise......
thanks all
