Subject: Re: [T2] battery terminal gunk


Clean the whole battery case. Pull the caps for the cells and wipe that
clean under there. Then replace the cables and keep it all clean with
periodic maintenance. Once this coorosion gets into the cables it can't be
removed.

&gt;Hi everyone. Simple question, I think. I seem to have excessive acid gunk 
&gt;build up around my battery terminals and I can't seem to keep it from 
&gt;returning after cleaning. Does anyone know what causes this?
