Subject: Re: [T2] Advice on interpreting my compression  check results

&gt; Can someone provide advice on what the compression numbers mean, assuming my

That engine isn't a spry youngster anymore but it seems to be coping all the
same. The book implies that 100-135 is drivable and you need to rebuild at
85.

&gt; Question 2 - Noisy valves
&gt; ===================
&gt; Ever since I have owned this Westy I have struggled with noisy valves. I have
&gt; found that
&gt; if I overfill (at least looks like it on the dipstick) by 1/2 to 3/4 quart
&gt; then the valves will pump

The low and high mark is about 1/2 quart so you are really overfilling the
engine doing that.

Overfilling is bad because it increases the crankcase pressure and this
leads to unnecessary oil leaks.

Also, any blow-by you experience as a result of low compression due to rings
and cylinders also increases crankcase pressure -&gt; oil leaks.

&gt; up and quite down. If I fill exactly to full line on dipstick then I can never
&gt; get rid
&gt; of the clatter. The oil type does not seem to matter. I ran synthetic last
&gt; year, and
&gt; switched to normal 30 weight last fall due to excessive leaking with
&gt; Synthetic.

Before going any further do you have the correct dipstick:

BTW, VWTrends finally did this synthetic article. Their concluded that the
temps were lower at ever place on the engine they measured the heat. The
ended the article by saying they now have oil leaks.

Where was it leaking? When this happens it's an indication of wear and poor
seals. Switching oil and watching the problem go away only works until it
becomes a bigger problem. I understand that we all just want to drive...
