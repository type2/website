&lt;&lt; One trick I have learned is heat the head with a propane torch, then ice 
the

stud.  Did this over the course of a day, and finally, the stud made a

little crack noise, and basically threaded right out!  PATIENCE is the word

here.  Beats a day of pulling the motor and head.


Good Luck!

Wonder if the same trick might work better/worse with dry ice... ?
