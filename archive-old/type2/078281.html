Subject: Schofield Distributor

Just a tip I'd like to pass along. . .

I was looking into ordering sheet metal from Alan Schofield in the UK and
Mr. Schofield notified me that he has a stateside distributor near me. I
contacted Wolfgang International in Redding, CA and they actually had the
part I needed in stock. I assume there are other Schofield distributors
across the states.
