Subject: Bay parts again (oops)

This is a forwarded message:

Hi,
    Two friends and I just bought the contents of a vw yard in Fort
Pierce, FL.  There are 22 bay window buses about half of which are
campers.  Although the
buses themselves are all very rusted, alot of the interiors are in good
shape.  Let me know where to post this most effectively.  I'll further
check out your site, we've
been swamped with work on this project as we've been given 90 days to
clear this place out.  We're selling complete cars for $75 and
everything is cheap!  We
would like to help out as many vw heads like us before it's all
scrapped.
Thanks,
Dave Walgrave
