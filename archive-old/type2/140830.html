Subject: Re: [T2] New axles too long?

From: &quot;Tom Shinn&quot;

Been trying to get my 75 back on the road again so I can meet some of you list members at the Jerome weekend. 
Spent last weekend installing new brake hoses and front wheel bearings. That went well. This weekend I removed 
my rear axles in order to install some new ones complete with installed cv joints and boots.
I thought this would make things easier. Well, not quite the case. Turns out
the new axles are over 20&quot; long. Wonder what they could be for? I suspect they were drop shipped from the 
manufacturer, not shipped from the folks I ordered them from.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the length of the bay axles:

manual  476mm (18 3/4 inches) both sides
auto tranny
left side  457mm  (18in)
right side 505mm  (19 7/8 inches)

Here are the Vanagon axle lengths:
manual 547.8mm (21.57 inches) both sides
auto tranny
left side 531mm (20.9 inches)
right side 579.3 (22.81 inches)
