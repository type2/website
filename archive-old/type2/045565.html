&gt;Hi, folks--
&gt;I'm replacing the seal around my engine door, and what I got to 
&gt;replace it doesn't look like what's there now.
&gt;The new seal was made by West Coast Metrics and is in 4 pieces:

Yep, what you get these days; a 4 piece seal kit.

Bus Depot does sell a single piece seal that is the best &quot;new&quot; that I 
am aware of as far as &quot;new replacement&quot; is concerned, and is pretty 
close to original, but not right there as far as perfect fit and seal.

With the 4 piece kit, you must miter cut and glue.
You can do it, and it comes out OK.

With the Bus Depot single piece seal, you just lay it in there and glue 
it in.
It come &quot;pretty close&quot; to being like original.

That rear engine door seal is the one to take care of with glycerin.
Once it is gone, it is gone, as far as being able to exactly replicate 
it through new purchase.
