Subject: Heater control pods

Hi

Has anyone any idea what the difference is between the heater control 
pods on a 2.0L Bus and a 2.0L Vanagon.  I have looked on the justkampers 
website and they appear identical but have diffrerent part numbers.  If 
they are different can the Vanagon ones be adapted to fit a bus?

thanks

John
