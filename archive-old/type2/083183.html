Subject: Re: [T2] removing stickers

be careful pulling those off. They might be structural by now :)

&gt; Hey everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought a mostly rough '71 camper that has a number of stickers all
&gt; over the rear.  I'd keep them if they were at all interesting and/or in
&gt; decent shape, but they're not.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions for removing old stickers from painted
&gt; surfaces without damaging the paint?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
