Subject: Turn Signal Trouble

I have a 73 Westy. Just put in an AVP 1800 motor a month ago. It goes in
tomorrow for its 300 mile oil change and valve adjustment.

Runs beautifully except for one small problem. My problem is that the right
turn signal is acting strangely. When I turn the right turn signal on,
sometimes the indicator light and clicking noise will signal normally,
sometimes it will vary the rhythm, sometimes it just stays on. Left is fine.

What is happening?

Thanks!

Nancy
