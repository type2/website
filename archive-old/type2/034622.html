Subject: exhaust analyer

Two years ago, I bought a Berg exhaust analyzer and mounted its sensor in a
hole I drilled in the dual quite packs on my Westy. By tuning the Kadrons,
I could make the LED bars move the entire range from too lean to too rich.

Today, my son's '74 bug with  a stock 1600 engine flunked our swell
Northern Virginia emissions test.  (While other states are relaxing the
requirements, VA is pushing the year back  -  at the present, to include
all cars since 1968. )

The guy at the emissions center would not attempt to tune the 34 PICT-3 so
we wanted to do so at home. I mounted the sensor so that its head stuck in
the pea shooter exhaust tube.  We adjusted the idle mixture and the bypass
screws but could not get the LED to move off of &quot;totally lean&quot;.

Can anyone suggest an explanation for this? I've since removed the dual
quite pack from my  Westy and replaced it with a stock muffler, so I can't
put it back into the old configuration to test the sensor itself.

My questions:
1. Is my stick-it-in-the-end-of-the-tailpipe approach flawed?
2. Should the sensor (which has its own heater) supposed to get hotter than
the 200F that my thermocouple read?
3. Has anyone found an emissions checker who is willing to let the owner
tune his own carb during the test?

Thanks, Jack
