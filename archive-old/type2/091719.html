Subject: Re: [T2] Converting Engine to Run on Propane (LPG) 

Hi,
This is not a difficult conversion to do on a air-cooled VW; and there are svereal companies doing it here in UK.
Just before the carb/input manifold a small venturi is added which is where the LPG is mixed with the air. Prior to this it has to be heated in a 'vaporiser' - heat is supplied via the engine therefore you still have to start on petrol.
Of course you also need an LPG tank fitted.

This conversion can be done to either type 1 or type 4 engines.

Any costs or contacts I could give you are all in UK - let me know if you want details.

Also there was an article on LPG conversion in issue 6 or 7 of &quot;VW Camper and Commercial&quot; magazine.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for information about converting an air-cooled VW bus to run on Propane (LPG) or Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). If not air-cooled then I'll have to buy a water-cooled Vanagon for this project.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know someone who actually has a propane- or natural gas-powered VW bus or Beetle?
