Subject: Re: [T2] RE: What the kidsare doing nowadays.

Ginny,

LOL! As a dad with two grown sons and 3 inherited granddaugters, forget 
the mom!&lt;grin&gt;...the grandson will thank you forever for *any* 
instuction in mechanical stuff...he might even turn out to be a Mechanical 
Engineer!

I had this discussion yesterday with my brother(in Kuwait as an oil 
engineer).

The reason we all still have and like our busses is because we generally 
don't have to rely on someone who is incompetent to repair things.

In my opinion the ability of the folks who are *supposed* to know how to 
fix things id dwindling....leaving....just US!

As a point in case, he had a &quot;newish&quot; Honda before he left the states that 
worked fine in Houston, but when he drove it north and it got cold, it 
wouldn't start.  I don't think he was *ever* able to get it fixed by the 
dealer.

Makes you wonder about the $75/hour labor charges at major 
dealerships....what are the doing with your car for that amount of 
money?..and *still* can't fix it!

Oh, my oldest son could care less about cars, but the youngest and I built 
an upright engine together for his ghia....*before* he found girls....
He hasn't turned a wrench since then, but he does know how.

Cheers, dave

&gt; My grandson  has loved my 71 bus ever since he can remember.  Now - 
aged 12, he is busily saving up for his own. - I declined to give \him 
mine when he reaches driving age.  

&gt; 
&gt; This drives his yuppy mother crazy because she has been trying 
to stop me driving mine for years and years.  
&quot;A dangerous, unsafe far too old to be on the road bus&quot;. 
Really think she was embarrassed to have it parked outside her house.  
Can't think how this happened to an Ontario farm kid.
&gt; 
&gt; Zander knows his Muir quite well. (8th birthday book)  
He badly  wants to find someone near with a bus so he can help with working on it.  
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes wonder if my daughter will ever forgive me.
