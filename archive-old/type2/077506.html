Subject: 1978 Champayne Edition

--part1_115.5f3db48.28f72366_boundary

What you described, is same as what I have. The vinyl is more of a redish 
brown and the cloth is a light brown corduroy (like a blast from the past) 
the vinyl on the walls and doors is the same as the seats with the crome 
insert. All the plastic, dash, steering column, door vent channels are a dark 
brown. The carpet is also a light brown. The body is like a teracotta over a 
dark brown with three strips that go all the way around the bus with the 
exception of the back. Very beautiful bus, Top of the line luxary, 7 pass 
mBz. And mine is for sale. I have a picture, only I don't know how to send it.
