&gt; Make sure it takes full size spools whatever you buy, and get a new tank
&gt; from HF or whoever is cheapest, mine is a midsize thing I really like only
&gt; about 2 feet tall, I'd never seen the size local.

John, list:
FWIW, my brother told me, just get a bottle of co2 from a pop dispenser, he
often finds them at garage sales. And sure enough, the next time he comes from
Omaha, he brings me one. Seems like Airgas told me : no problem, but you need
this adapter. I don't think I've filled it yet, been using it a lot recently.
On that subject, I have to say, I've been pretty impressed with Airgas. I think
they are a national chain. Better prices than the other 2 suppliers in town,
and always expert salesmen. I was looking at a Thermal Dynamics PLASMA welder a
friend picked up at an industrial surplus auction- GM r+ d, I think. Pretty
incredible thing, power supply would go down to some really low numbers, like 1
amp or something. I asked the counter guy at Airgas, he said: Get the numbers
off it, one of our salesmen is quite familiar with them, we'll find out
anything you need to know.
No dumb looks there! ( I didn't act quickly enough, somebody else snagged it!)
They get all my business, I don't even call around!
