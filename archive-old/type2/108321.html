Frank,

Sounds to me like that's about right. Don't forget sticks usually only get
20mpg or so. Autos get worse gas milage (that's the penalty for not shifting
manually).

Other tips to increase gas milage:

Maintain correct tire inflation and if anything, maybe a couple psi more.
Just don't over do it as the higher the pressure, the harder handling and
riding

Make sure your brakes aren't hanging up and your e-brake is off.

Make sure your bearings are smooth. Jack up the front wheels and turn the
wheel and see if the tire rotates without much effort.

Avoid jackrabit starts, I can't imagine how slow an auto would be compared
to a stick, but the slower and more gradual your start, the better your gas
milage.

Make sure the tranny is actually going into high gear (not missing the top
end). Try manually shifting it and seeing if it drops into the high gear
(I'm assuming it's a 3speed tranny?)

But my guess is 14-17 mpg is about right...if you have a camper or weekender
or are hauling heavy loads, that also eats away gas milage.

Always thought it would be a great study to see how much gas we burn in
America with our overweight population. 50 extra pounds has to amount to a
mile less per gallon or something like that?

Anyway good luck. and if you want better milage, get a vanagon with a
diesel! I drive a 00 TDI Golf Auto and I get 43 mpg on the highway and about
40 around town. If I had a stick (couldn't get one at the time) I can pull
close to 50 mpg.
