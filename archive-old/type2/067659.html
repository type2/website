Subject: '67 Westy Resto Update- Cabinetry R&amp;R

Now that the rest of the world is bracing for Winter, Southern Arizonans are
coming to life. I opted to avoid (I didn't say boycott but so be it) the
Phoenix Bug-O-Rama and Slammed Honda-thon. $14 per person plus $3.00 parking
and $5.00 hotdogs kinda chaps my butt. A quick check of the local VW buddies
gave contrasting opinions. A few/most said that it was a waste, smaller than
ever, crappy car show (lower quality than years past), another pal, &quot;Michael
the Brit&quot; from Albuquerque said that he had one of the best days selling
used bits that he has had in the past few years. Great! I happily stayed
home and worked on the buses and parts that I already have. Personally, I'm
glad that the show is there for the offering. It takes alot to promote a show.

'67 Westy Resto:

*Cabinetry R&amp;R Weekend-
Now that all of the wood interior is installed and looking fine it was time
for the refurbishing of the SO-42 cabinetry...

All last week as I had time I cleaned, sanded and reglued as necessary. Good
old &quot;Elmer's&quot; &lt;wood glue&gt; and bondage time. On Saturday I applied English
oil to the inside of the long coat closet piece. Tested before going crazy.
At first it looked too dark but majorly soaked in and lightended by Sunday
afternoon. &lt;Test on junk cabinets if you have them before doing this to
yours&gt;. Sunday I refurbished the rear over head cabinet. I carefully removed
the strip of White &quot;T&quot; moulding on the lead edge of the under side. Then
sanded and glued into place a paper thin sheet of maple veneer to that
scared up/beat up under surface. Cut and glued into place the right sized
piece of left over Baltic birch on the &quot;inside&quot; of the same cabinet. The
sucker looks *fresh*! =) I then gingerly applied a light even swiping of
Golden Oak stain to both of those surfaces and wiped off quickly. It looks
as it should (to me). The stain did not end up as a yellow zonkers 1950s
blonde wood as you might fear. It was real subtle but made the wood look
finished and appropriate. No varnish on these surfaces! Over kill? maybe but
it looks near perfect. Mrs. VanBondo said &quot;My Gosh Rusty, NO one will ever
see it!!! I told her that the point was to have fun and I was having it. I
knew it was done. It's' rare when I am as quiet and relaxed as I was.
(Ahhhh!, yes)  MY brain thinks that now is not the time to cheap out and
have the cabinets hang out like a sore thumb. 
I have other extra veneer that will go inside of the rear facing back
surface of the inside of the Z-bed base cabinet. That surface is chewed to
death and could use a lift while I have the materials handy. Why not. Now
this is an area that I really could skip but what the &quot;hey.&quot; Another scrap
of the 1/8&quot; Baltic Birch will go on the floor surface of the same base
cabinet. The repainted Z-bed mechanicals look killer when placed in there
for a dry fit. The paint was matched to OEM at the local &quot;Home Depot&quot;
(warehouse style hardware store)and stuffed into a couple of cans at the car
paint supply place. The same light chocolate milk color was applied to the
cabinet clamp latches and metal wood paneling runners that go as a support
under the wood wall panels on the floors. (Details)...
I got the clamp support for the rear surface of the long coat closet from
Jon Furst of the Route66 Splits/NEATO (Albuquerque,NM) fame. Thanks Jon!
Mrs.VanBondo and I experimented with boiling water and the old stiff brittle
white edging and &quot;T&quot; moulding. When doused with or submerged into boiling
water the shrunken, whithered, and wrinkled like a used BandAid/Elastoplast
things become momentarily supple and workable! It quickly returns to the
stiff as heck stage rapidly. Ya gotta work fast! Cautious use of a heat gun
may work as well. Obviously don't work with the water and electric gun at
the same time. 

Over all the bus is coming together and is looking great! Wolfsburg West
continues to claim that it will be yet another week and one half before the
great looking OEM style repop grey kicks/door/headliner panels will come
in... (I've heard *that* one before).
