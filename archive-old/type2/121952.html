Subject: RE: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

I was at RMMW (Rocky Mouton Motor Works) last summer and there was a
gentlemen from Texas (Don't have his name off hand) that had modified a 73
Bay with a diesel bunny engine, he put two custom radiators up in the frame
with electric fans to cool it off with, Vary clean installation.
On the down side was Noise from the Diesel and the 002 trany was geared
wrong.
Plus-side getting 30mpg with it.

Doug...
