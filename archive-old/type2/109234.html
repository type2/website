Subject: Re: [T2] Brake won't release...

You might want to double check that line again. Sometimes they look OK from
the outside but they have swelled on the inside restricting the flow of
fuid. What year bus is it? It may be a blocked compinsation port in the
master cylinder also. I am assuming this is on the rear wheels since you
mentioned the hand break right?

 I've checked the brake line and can't find any blockages
&gt; close to the wheel.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Anyone care to suggest what might be the problem? I'm starting to
&gt; suspect the master cylinder..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
