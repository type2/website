Subject: Re: Battery Pan rust 

    &gt;Perhaps there's a reason, but why don't VW owners just add a rubber
    &gt;battery tray?

had a bug once, rusty old thing.  took a trip
to maine, perforce on logging roads.  stopped
for lunch and then the car wouldn't start.
turned out the battery cables led through a hole
in the floor.

since then, i've used plywood under my battery
