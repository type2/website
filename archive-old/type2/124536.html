Subject: Re: [T2] Koni shock bulk purchase

Cheers to Richard that have been doing another altruistic effort for the 
type 2 owners finding an already extinguished item for the buses, my Koni 
shocks are old but perform very very well, the only thing I can add is good 
look in your adventure, to the 25 privileged that will get them.
