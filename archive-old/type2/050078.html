Subject: [T2] Type 4 Heads

Friends,
Sorry to ask about this, but I checked the archives for hours without luck. 
What I am wondering is if new heads for the 1800cc are made in Brazil. The 
archives said a lot about new heads made in Spain, but I was told the heads 
put on this engine were new Brazillian parts.

After reading countless tales of dropped valve seats, I am going to talk to 
a friend of my father's (who happens to have a whole lot of computer 
controlled machine tools) how difficult/costly it would be to make new heads 
that wont drop seats. Its bound to be outrageous, Im sure. Just that 2.45am 
curiosity I suppose. Ill inform the list of my findings if there is any 
interest indicated.

Type 4 Insomniac
