Subject: Starter and Oil Leak

After putting in a new/used canadian rebuild I thought my troubles with
oil leaks into my bell housing were over ...... I over looked one thing.

When you reseal the engine after a nasty leak on clutch check your
starter, mine was FULL of oil.  It still worked for 3k and may have been
about to go anyhow.  After disassembly, cleaning, &amp; new brushes it works
fine.

Have learned alot reading this list.  Am about to replace the 4 speed
and have my vice grips ready to tackle the cv joint bolts!
