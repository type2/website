&gt;My '78 campmobile won't start.

&gt;The engine turns over. If I push open the flap in the airflow meter, fuel 
&gt;circulates. All fuses in the fuse box are intact.
&gt;
&gt;After turning over the engine my coil was pretty warm to the touch, so I 
&gt;checked the spark from the coil. It appears I have no spark. I thought the 
&gt;coil must be the problem so I installed a new one. Evidently the coil 
&gt;wasn't the problem. Still no spark.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas? Thanks.

Check the battery?
I had a bus (don't remember the year). The battery was in the engine 
compartment. Anyway it would crank &amp; crank &amp; crank but not start. Turned 
out the battery needed servicing, it had enough juice to either crank but 
not crank &amp; fire.
Good luck.
