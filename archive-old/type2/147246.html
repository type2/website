Subject: Interesting oil leak. Need some opinions

OK, this oil leak is interesting. If the vehicle is on the flat, it will
drop a silver dollar size oil spot under it, If the vehicle is nose down in
my driveway which makes the front tires about 10&quot; lower than the rear ones,
I get a pretty good sized football sized spot there by the morning. It's
over on the passenger side front corner area of the engine a couple of
inches back from where it bolts up to the tranny. Anyone care to hazard a
guess as to where the leak is coming from? I am thinking the oil moves down
to that area of the engine due to the slant, and there is a leak at the
farthest forward pushrod tube, on the engine end? I don't think it's coming
from the mainseal, but hey, you type 4 engine pros can enlighten me. :-)
Thanks, 
Courtney
