This is a re-post of my previous announcement.  Would someone who is on the Vintage Bus and Vanagon lists post it there for me.  I don't want to exclude those folks by any means!!!   

Thanks to those who have responded.  I look forward to seeing everyone on Saturday.


Hi Volks -

As customary (at least for the last few years), I'm hosting an afternoon get together of volks folks at my house the day BEFORE (September 5th, that is) the Manassas Bugout this weekend. So if you plan to be rolling into the area the day before the big show, you are invited to join us.

In past years we've camped out at local campgrounds afterwards, but this time we're just going to cruise up to Manassas in the early evening and checkout the happenings at the hotels/motels where everyone hangs out. 

I'm also offering up &quot;camping&quot; space in my driveway if anyone wants to spend the night and join our eratz club in the early morning as we once again claim &quot;inside the wire&quot; parking at the show. 

Here are the particulars:


Date: September 5th (Saturday)

Time: 1pm until whenever 
Location: Montclair VA (approx 12 miles away from the Bugout site). RSVP to me (busickX_at_erols_dot_com) and I'll send detailed directions.

What to bring: You, your VDub, and your own beverage of choice. If you want...bring something to share with the group, but this isn't required.

I hope you'll join us. Steve Dolan....Mr. List himself....the man
behind the administrivia......&quot;may&quot; join us.......he's even promised to bring an extra coil (we'll explain that on Saturday).

Bye. Bob
