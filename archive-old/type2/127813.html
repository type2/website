Subject: Re: [T2] Continued AIRS drama/Nashville TN

Danny (the guy stuck here) gave me a ring last night. He was finishing
the install and having some issues. What he described was that the
engine ran ok, but when the clutch was pushed the engine started to
bog down. I asked about the endplay. He did not have a way to measure
it, but it sure sounded like a lot. The guy he bought the parts bus
from locally messed with the shims, but Danny couldn't remember what
he did. I'm suspecting the thrust surface or main is worn bad enough
to cause the rods to bind on the crank when the clutch is pressed. His
rear wheel brake has apparently been stuck in a bind so that is what
he was going to work on today. Does this diagnosis sound correct?
