Special thanks Dean for posting this.  I cut a deal with the seller and
just got back from a whirlwind trip, KC to Dallas and back in 24 hours!!
I flew down and 'crawled' back, quadruple clutching 1/2 of the way home.

It turned out it was a 59 European Single Cab--flutted headlights,
semaphore holes, km speedo etc.  The 1641 runs hot, but has an eletric
fuel pump to forego the vapor lock.  I'll try to remedy this problem soon.
There were about 5 things wrong with this beast I christianed 'Zorm', all
related to the shiftlessness of the tranny.  A pitstop at a friend's
Oklahoma home last night remedied most of the problems so I could make it
home.  I also got to crash (sleep) in his Westy near his chicken coup.
Roosters crow very loudly and not nessarily at the break of day.  They
enjoy crowing all through the night!!  At any rate, a very restful
experience after making it though northeastern Texas and Oklahoma with
only 3rd &amp; 4th gears.  My nerves were shot!

Now the metallic teal, white and primered 'Zorm' now rests (and cools
down) in my driveway.  

BTW, he's named Zorm after some highway strangeness.  Along waterways &amp;
creeks etc. in the midwest there are gauging stations that look like
outhouses. I (we) passed one in northern Oklahoma that was graffitied:
&quot;EVIL HOME OF ZORM&quot;.  I laughed outloud for about a mile.  The stress of
2-geared highway driving was behind us and I believe that Zorm's spirit
escaped from the gauging station and jumped into the soul of the '59! 
A good omen for the rest of the drive.  Too bad we ran out of gas 50 miles
south of KC, but that was driver error.  I guess it was good luck that a
good samartan helped us from there.  What a long 'slow' trip it's been!
