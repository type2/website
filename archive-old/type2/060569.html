Yes the stock fuel pump will do fine.  Even Gene Berg (R.I.P.) has a
rant about fuel pumps where he says he uses a 1950-something VW bus
fuel pump in his dragsters and that you shouldn't need electric pumps
in a VW.  I have personally used the stock pump with Cabrons -- I mean
Kadrons :-) -- with no problems attributable to fuel pump.

By the way if listmember suppliers don't have  rebuild kits for your
rebuildable pump, BFY has 'em for even my old, old type with a hundred
screws around the rim and a threaded fuel line fitting.  And yes both
my VWs use alternators.

This is not to say that electric fuel pumps aren't any good.  Make
sure the one you use has a supply pressure that matches VW carbs'
design limits (pretty low pressure), otherwise you will have real
problems.

one VW with Facet electric fuel pump (cuz it is a FI block and no
place for a mechanical pump), 
and one VW with stock fuel pump.
