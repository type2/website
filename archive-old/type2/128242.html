Subject: Re: [T2] Tire shop apes broke my bus (long) 

&gt;   Actually, the moral is that if you need to have someone else
&gt;   touch your bus, make sure it's an owner-proprietor if you
&gt;   can help it.

I am lucky -- the guy I use actually went to
Germany to VW school back when &quot;factory trained&quot;
meant just that.  He, in turn, works for a former
Air Force colonel whose shop is, to say the least,
spotless.  As long as Whitey is still there, I'm
golden (well, ignoring the parts question...)
