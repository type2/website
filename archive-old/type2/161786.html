Subject: raising (ground clearance) a 71 type II

Can all provide some good advice, tips, guidance on raising a Westy for 
ground clearance... nothing like a monster truck, but just a couple inches 
for better tires, and ground clearances.

I already plan on 15&quot; x 5&quot; rims, with correctly spec'd and proper tires... 
height and width.

I know of problems that can be had with the steering gear (box, and pivot 
point, etc), and strain on CV joints from the steep angles, so I don't want 
to make a &quot;fashion&quot; statement (or again a monster truck)... just a little 
added extra height.

I have heard and visited the websites of the front axle assembly builders, 
and may have to purchase one of these in the future, but I want to be sure 
that it can be performed, and I can elevate the rear (with destroying the 
CV's) to match the front (new height).

Or am I completely out in left field, and it cannot, and should not be done 
!

PS I have also visited BAJA BUS site, and it is interesting to say the 
least.
