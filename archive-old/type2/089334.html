Subject: Re: [T2] setting off car alarms

as far as being fatal....
I don't think os,
BUT... I have heard 2 schools of thought on it.
(if any bus gurrus could tell me the truth I would much aprecheat it)

1) the guy that bought whtat used to be the VW shop in town (his a dick)
    says &quot;better fix that exhaust son, or you'll burn your heads up..&quot;

2) every VW fanatic I'v ever seen face to face sayes
     &quot;wow your bus sonds great,... loud.. but great&quot;
    (and never a word about cooked heads)

    I have had a LOUD bus sence I got her in '98, (about 60,000 mi ago) and
now I'v finnaly graduated, and got a job (50 miles away, so I drive atleast
100 mi a day in my bus) so I can finnaly make my wife and mom happy by
getting a new exhaoust system: muffler.

all my leaks are at the joints (where the flanges meet) they all join like
() instead of flush...

so take that as  you will....

Mike,
'78 Bus: with loud leaky exhaust. :)
