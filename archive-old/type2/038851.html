Subject: Wiring Harness/Pheonix dealers

Hi,
just thought I'd pass along a good experience with Wiring Works.  I searched
high and low for a wiring harness for my '71 and was finally steered towards
Wiring Works.  The harness is beautiful and arrived very quickly.  Thanks to
everyone for offering to cut out their old ones, but no longer needed.
    Also (since its Friday), is anyone familiar with any dealerships that
deal with old vw's in the Pheonix area?  I'm headed down there in a couple
of weeks and would like to drag along my Thing to sell, but don't want to
worry about finding a buyer in only 2 days.  Please pmail if you know of
anyplace.
Thanks,
Paul
