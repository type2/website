Subject: re Vanagon vs Bus engine
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

When I got my 75 bus with a 79 engine in it, the
exhaust was shot, rusted  badly, and the heater boxes
were unusable.  Luckily, I found some Vanagon heater
boxes at a swap meet, cheap, and used them even though
all the holes for air for heat aren't quite the same.
The great thing is that they have stainless steel
outer metal instead of rustable steel--no more rusty
heater boxes!
