We are 100% go on EveryBus 2001. You are also correct on the dates. I 
have been a little busier than I would like to be lately so I have 
not followed up with the usual shameless promotion :) For anyone not 
sure what this is about please visit the we bsite for this wonderful 
bus event taking place in North Carolina.

BTW,  Nikki is driving accross country for this so you can too :)



&gt;Haven't heard anything about Everybus in a while. Could you confirm
&gt;those dates? I seem to recall it being scheduled for April 20-22. Is
&gt;that still good?
