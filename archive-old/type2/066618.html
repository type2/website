Subject: Re: 65' bus door key question

&gt;My question is as follows..
&gt;
&gt;If you take the door handle apart (take the cargo door handle) you will
&gt;notice that there is a four digit number with a &quot;T&quot; preceeding it (i.e.
&gt;T1234) I know this number corresponds to the way to cut they key. 
&gt;
&gt;My question is does VW still have those codes about i.e. can you give them
&gt;that number and they would know how to properly cut the key?

The dealer should have the codes, and generally will make you a key from 
the code for about five bucks.  I've done this often.  In one case I ran 
across a dealer who no longer had the punch to make the key with (in which 
wase I had to go to another dealer).  In another case, the dealer had the 
code and the punch but not the blank, so I went to a lock shop, bought a 
blank for a buck, and then brought it back to the dealer for cutting.
By the way, my '63 parts car had the same key for doors and ignition.
