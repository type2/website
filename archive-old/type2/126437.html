Subject: Re: [T2] missile command

Now that I've heard from just about every subscriber...

I'm sorry about the post to the list. It WAS AN ACCIDENT. Gmail
selected the wrong address when I was trying to send it elsewhere and
I didn't catch it.

I would never send something so patently lame to a mailing list. It
was supposed to go to my work account...

Again, I'm sorry.
