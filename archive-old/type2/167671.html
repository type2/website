&gt; So, we're now at Camp Verde, AZ - almost 4,000 feet altitude, desert climate
&gt; (not quite as hot as Phoenix), there are big hills here, and any drive to a
&gt; store is at least a 20 minute schlep. She's my daily driver. We'd love a
&gt; more powerful engine than the stock one (duh). If we buy a new engine, what
&gt; would you fellas recommend? Thanks.

if you are not doing all the work yourself keep it as close to stock
as you can, customization cost $$$$$

get the Bentley and learn your bus, make mistakes on your old engine,
then get a good quality stock engine for that bus. Boston Bob and
Seattle connecting rod are two often reccomended.  if it costs less
than $2,500 for a 2 liter engine you are probably not getting any
quality.  (avoid GEX at any cost)
