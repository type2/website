Subject: Re: [T2] Correct Voltage regulator for 1972 bus

&gt;  CIP1 looks like the right one is
&gt; that right?
&gt;

That be it. If you have the time, watch for NOS mechanical ones. Too
many folks I've talked to with replacement electronic ones have had
failures within a few years. NOS ones pop up on the samba classifieds
every so often. I still have a good mechanical one from my 73 in my
garage that will go in the Guac if I ever need to replace it before I
go to a GM one wire alt.
