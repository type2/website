&gt; I have to chime in on this one.  The last sales job I had was working for an industrial hose distributor.  I even used to sell those big Teflon lined hoses that they use on tanker trucks that haul dangerous chemicals.  (I loved those sales because they were over $20 a foot.)  Any reputable hose supplier will be able to tell you exactly what chemicals are acceptable for a particular hose.  They keep track of MSDS's on chemicals and manufacturer's recommendations.   It's a big liability issue.  I know a truck driver who was is partially blind because he didn't listen to those recommendations.   Cheers....KR

ABSOLUTELY they always ask whay yoou plan on using it for.  PSI, etc.
