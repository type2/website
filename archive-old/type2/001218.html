I have a ???? for the masses
I have been having problems with my wipers (ok no prob they just don't work)
so i stripped the whole wiper assembly motor and all out of a 76 donor bus i
have and replaced everything in my 74 but......still no go.


I have realized now my problem wasn't the wiper setup it is wiring, the PO
has
made an absolute mess of the underside of my dash. I am going to attempt to
decipher the mess and fix what is wrong.

Can anyone tell me if there is a difference between the fuse block in a
74-76??
the reason i ask this is b/c the fuse clip number 3  from the passenger side
is
melted in my 74 and i want to switch fuse blocks

Also there are thick yellow and white wires coming from in behind the fuse
block
that in the 74 are clipped and just hanging there taped but in the 76 are
intacked
can someone tell me what they are or should be attatched to on the other
end.


Any help would be greatly appreciated
I cannot for the life of me make sense of a wiring diagram
