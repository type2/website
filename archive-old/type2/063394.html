Subject: RE: 1962 Westy Hatch Sunroof

Is this the hatch that is about 2X3 feet and located above the floor space
inside of the forward, rear door?  I haven't started looking for anything for
this hatch on my bus, but I've considered purchasing an engine compartment lid
seal from WCM or RMMW so that it doesn't leak again this winter.  It looks like
there would be enough to do the job, and sizes are similar.  The hinge pieces
that bolt through the roof look like something that could be turned out on a
lathe fairly easily, and I have considered making an engineering drawing of
these and checking with local machine shops as to cost for reproducing in
aluminum.  Then I could get everything anodized for long life.  If the part that
actually attaches to the hatch is gone, that is another story.

Good luck,
terry &amp; Sunshine ('64 Westy)

     I'm new to the newsgroup.  I own an unrestored 1962 Westfalia camper. 
     My father in law purchased the car new in Germany in 62.  
     
     The hatch sunroof has failed.  The hinge seals leaked and rotted the 
     hinge bolts.  I've just started ordering catalogs and thought I'd ping 
     the newsgroup to try to get a quick pointer to anyone that still makes 
     hatch sunroof parts.  Does anyone still make or have parts for the 
     1962 hatch sunroof?
