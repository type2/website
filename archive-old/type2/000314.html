&gt;...Can he sue me?

Depending on not only the state but the jurisdiction of the city in which
&quot;Rip-Off&quot; resides. In Burlington, Washington, for example, city law looks at
a bounced check the exact same as shoplifting. If it's over $250.00 you are
in some serious deep s**t in Burlington. Not trying to scare the s**t out of
you but this could be a problem...
