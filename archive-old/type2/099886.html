Subject: Windshield Rot!

Hello M8S

Long time no post...I've been off list for years, but I still check in 
now n then ( anybody remember Bob Hoover? T-Bear...you still out 
there?) ...good to see the list still alive and well.

I am getting ready to tackle the windshied rot on Hilda and I would 
like to get the input from you metalworking gurus before I go at it.  
The rot is bad...several 1 inch long holes and the metal is thin and 
flakey...I have ordered the repair metal from Bus Depot (backordered 
that is) and I am interested if anyone has used the metal and how 
difficult the surgery was.
I did my lower sliding door panel years ago and botched the job due to 
bad alignment...it seems like a miscalculation on the windshield welds 
and the glass aint gonna go back in....all tips,clues and enlightenment 
will be appreceiated...if you are just guessing, never mind...I can do 
that :-)
