I have two (driver's and passenger's) seats for sale out of a 1971 Westy.
They are the low back style, in good shape, with sheepskin seat covers on
them.  $50 for the pair, buyer pays shipping.  I can get pix if you're
interested.  (425) 831-7655, glens_at_centurytel_dot_net.  Located in Seattle, WA
area.
