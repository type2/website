&gt;I have to retorque my heads. As soon as I am done, I want to test the  
compression. How will testing a cold engine effect the
&gt;readings?  (Archives are down.)
&gt;TIA

Mark,
Yes, the compression readings will be inaccurate. You want to set the valves 
cold, then install and run the engine for 10 minutes 
or so, then pull the plugs and run the compression test.
