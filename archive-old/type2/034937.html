Subject: Re: Re-tourque Heads

After ignoring the retorque bizz and my 1600 heads coming loose I could hear
a fairly loud exhaust leak when the engine was under heavy load.  Like a
Harley, my little brother was impressed.  Before they got that loose I
noticed my valve clearances getting continually tighter and tighter after
I'd reset them.  My inclination to check the valve clearances was a slight
backfire thing going on at idle.  In order to really check the torque you
have to remove all that tin covering the bolts.  Can't do that without
pulling the engine unless you have an engine hatch on top like the
post-72(?) busses.

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek

&gt;
&gt; this may seem like a dumb question; but without pulling the engine how
would
&gt; I know if my heads are loose and need to be tightened.  My 1600 Engine
westy
&gt; has about 30000 miles on it and the heads have never been torqued.

&gt; Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
