&lt;&lt; Upon showing the film in public for the first time, Lelouch was arrested.

has never revealed the identity of the driver, and the film went underground
until a DVD release a few years ago&quot;

HYPE... The videocassette's been available for years on (among other
places), &lt;&lt;  www.motorbooks_dot_com  &gt;&gt;... ;-(

In addition, a few/some film experts consider it a fake...Yes, the Ferrari
was driven around Paris, but (as I said, I wouldn't know) the film was 
advanced/speeded up to seem as if the speeds were (as they say in 
traffic court), &quot;excessive&quot;...

YMMV...
