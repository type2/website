Subject: Fuel pump on 1800 

--part1_18f.755927e.2a0159f7_boundary

Hello all,

My '75 has an 1800 pancake motor in it that was fuel injection once upon a 
time, but was converted to dual carbs by one of my predecessors.  I am having 
a problem with flooding, and am wondering if it is the fuel pump.  Should it 
still be electric?  Or should I replace it with something else?  Gee, can you 
guess my knowledge is limited?

Re. Being Sued...  I concur also with the let-them-come-after-you approach.  
Please don't tell them that I made a button out of a Saab crest emblem!

Thanks in advance,

Tracy Hill
