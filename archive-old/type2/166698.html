Going to the first site that came up on doing a google search on &quot;finned
tubing&quot;, this site http://www.fintube_dot_com/ has some really interesting stuff
that may work quite well. Also, you may be able to find the finned tubing in
some kind of salvage industrial heat exchanger. If it is steel, you can weld
it into rows with weldable u-bend steam pipe fittings available at any good
plumbing supply store or sweat solder copper fittings if it is copper
tubing.

&gt;    I wonder whether a radiator is really needed.  Finned copper piping
&gt; (which I merely assume to exist  -  you'd think I'm an economist) in
&gt; a loop to a heater by the driver's feet i.e a small radiator might
&gt; get rid of the heat well enough?  The mini-radiator would presumably
&gt; take the full flow, and be &quot;turned off&quot; by a flap ducting the hot air
&gt; from it away from the cab.  I loosely guesstimate that the total
&gt; finned metal in this layout would roughly equal what's in a Subaru
&gt; radiator.
