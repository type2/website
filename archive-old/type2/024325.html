Ok I replaced my heater boxes with J-Tubes, runs a lot quiter but one side has a small exhaust leak, is there a special clamp I can use where it meets  the muffler? If so please let me know where I can find it. Thanks. Also am I harming the heads by not having heater boxes under them that the tin surrounds so that the air can blow through? Seems to me that more air can get to them with the j-tubes in.
