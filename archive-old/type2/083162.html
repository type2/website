Subject: Table

Was wiritten********************************
 Roy has a 76 Westy but does not have the rear table.
He has the arm but needs the table top and whatever
the mounts are underneath it. I think this table has a
flip up leaf as well. If you have and want to sell it
and can bring it to EveryBus 
***************************************************

There is a table on E-Bay in good condition right now
for 25$$
