Subject: Re: [T2] Gunson exhaust gas tester opinions wanted

Tom I use a Gunson on my aircooled motorcycle and it is a great instrument.
I set it to run a nice blue flame at about 3000rpm where my bike likes to
cruise the most. That leaves it a bit rich at lower rpm but that is ok with
me, because I prefer a bit of extra cylinder cooling. My only concern with
the Gunson on a VW is how you would be able to view the combustion in the
cylinders ? On my inline 4 motorcycle all the sparkplug holes are readily
available to see straight into, but on a flat 4 would you be able to look
down into the spark plug holes when inserting the Gunson &quot;sparkplug&quot; ??

Subject: [T2] Gunson exhaust gas tester opinions wanted

 

I am concidering purchacing a Gunson gas tester. I am thinking about this
unit

because there are no shops in Flagstaff Az. that I have found that are
willing

to work on an air cooled engine. SMog tests are not required in this area,

YET. I am supposed to receive my newly rebuilt engine from Bus Depot/AVP in
2

days. I have purchaced a new afm for it, the original had dead spots. Is the

Gunson gastester suitable for setting the correct c.o. level. Is it truly a

reliable instrument when used correctly or just another gimick to drain my

wallet?

Thanks

Tom
