&gt; Has anyone every heard of this kind of thing? Was it a regularly
&gt; published magazine? Oh, I forgot to say, it's called
&gt; &quot;Flotter Transport&quot; which apparently means &quot;Fleet Transport&quot;??
&gt; 

I've not heard of that magazine, but VWoA published (still publishes?) a 
similar magazine. The last issue I saw was a few years after the VW 
rabbit came out. There was an article of a guy who had driven his Rabbit 
PU for over 200K miles before he totalled it. This was on the original 
engine... and he was keeping it for parts. His job was to collect grain 
samples in the Mid-West, and the rig ran 14 hours a day, 6 days a week.

The first issue I recall seeing was back in the late 60s.

Maybe this was a spin off? It sounds like a great find!
