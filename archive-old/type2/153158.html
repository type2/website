Subject: no rings no things?

the shop that tore down the crapcase said i likely had excess case 
pressure (in part because the draft tube was hardened and stiff, and 
not letting it release)... just curious how bad ya'll think the rings 
are, and if they look like the cuprits.

keep in mind that 1) none of the cylinder #s match the piston numbers 
- because the shop didn't mark ANY of them, just tossed em in a box.

and 2) after this experience, i take anything the shop  said w/ a 
grain of salt.  for all i know, they just wanted to sell me new p/c 
and rings.  these have less than 3K on them.


the scratches on a few of pistons  are from crapcase mk1, which had 
so much casting sand embedded in the metal's pores that when the case 
heated up it  the sand came out, scoured the mains and scratched some 
cyl walls :P
