Hello Brad and T-2 list,
Though I haven't posted to this list before, I have been following it from 
time to time in digest mode. 
I would like to help answer your questions about the BA-6 heater. 
If it is blowing the overheat switch fuse, it is possible that the regulator 
sensor is defective, or very dirty. This is at the output end of the heater, 
in the plastic duct that connects between the heater and the air duct. 
Loosen the clamp to pull it out, they are usually covered with lint and dirt. 
When they fail, the heater doesn't cycle off and heat up to the point that it 
triggers the overheat switch which in turn blows the 8 amp fuse in the black 
fuse holder near the main fuse block. the safety switch also triggers. The 
heater can't be operated again until the fuse is replaced, and the safety 
switch lever is flipped. 
The popping can be from low voltage, restricted intake air hose, 
fouled/defective glow/spark plug, or a slow combustion blower motor due to 
worn bearing(s) or brushes. 
If you have a spare thermostat regulator, try this first. There is a test you 
can also make to determine if the switch is bad. 
Make sure that the battery voltage is above 13 volts, the fuel filter is 
clean, and that the air intake hose is not plugged.
Robert
