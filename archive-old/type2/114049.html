Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust leaks and burnt valves

I had a loose head on a Beetle that I owned in Italy. Drove it for a couple 
weeks like this b/c I thought it was an exhaust leak.

When I got it apart I discovered the exhaust gases had eaten a hole in the 
side of the cylinder. Strangely did not seem to harm the head. Replaced the 
whole engine though and kept the spare parts from the loose head engine .
