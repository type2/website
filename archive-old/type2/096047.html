&gt;There was a oil filter report on the net about a year ago. This guy
&gt;took every known filter available , cut it open and inspected them
&gt;for quality.

It's still up at http://www.minimopar_dot_net/oilfilterstudy.html .  I think
it bounced around for a bit because the Mini-Mopar people's Web hosting
bounced around - they used to not have the domain name, etc.

&gt;His site got shut down by the big filter makers for saying the truth.

Actually, he got a letter from a _retailer_ regarding Champion Labs
filters.  He did take it down for a bit, changed some of the content,
and put it back up.  The details are on his FAQ page.

On the main page above, he bought several versions of the filter for
Ford 351 and 5.0 V8s.  He has another page where he did filters for
water-cooled VWs at http://www.minimopar_dot_net/oilfilterstudy-german.html .
