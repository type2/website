&gt; sounds like a really common occurrence - I heard of a guy whose bus got

&gt;
&gt; &gt; and the other side of the story, I had a tractor trailer clip me (driver
&gt; &gt; fell asleep at the wheel) spun me sideways into his trailer, the spare on
&gt; &gt; the front of my bus hit his wheel and kept me from getting close enough
&gt; &gt; for the box to actually hit my bus, I was pushed away and had some
&gt; &gt; relatively minor damage, at 55mph. I think if the spare wasn't there I
&gt; &gt; would have hit him broadside with the front of the bus since the bumper
