&gt; Interestingly, I have never seen a case of carbon monoxide poisoning brought

&gt; the coronor and take them to the morgue or funeral home.

I've seen one case of CO poisoning, and it is just about in the &quot;Darwin
Award&quot; category.  I was desert camping (not with a VW group) and one idiot
couple decided to take their hibachi barbeque inside their van to warm it
up.  The only way they survived is because a buddy missed them being
around the campfire and went to see what was up.  They did not respond to
knocking on the outside of their van and their buddy finally opened the
door uninvited.  They were both unconscious and barely came around when
they were carried out of their van into the cold desert air.  They
escaped with headaches from hell.  If their friend had just decided that
they had gone to bed early they would have been dead.
