Subject: Re: [T2] Question for All the Water Cooled Converts

&gt;Just curious, VW in Mexico used to sell the water cooled Bus (exactly like
&gt;ours) up until 2001. I'm not sure how long they produced them, but there's
&gt;got to be a way to get parts for the Bus. With that in mind, how come 
&gt;people
&gt;are looking for alternative water cooled motors when they could get a 
&gt;direct
&gt;drop in motor from Mexico?
&gt;
Do you mean Brazil?
