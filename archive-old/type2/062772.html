Subject: RE: Stuck bus...something ain't right

My friend's '74 did this too when he absolutely had to use his parking brake to
keep his bus in his very steep driveway.  My suggestion to him was too leave
room in the flat part of his driveway to park and let everything cool down
before applying the parking brakes hard.  It seems the differential contraction
as everything cools can cause siezing even under dry conditions.  I've only had
this happen on my Splittie when it is parked for a long time in the dampness
under the redwoods.  Other things to check are no binding and good lubrication
in the cable/linkage that actuates the parking brake as this can cause
intermittent sticking due to thermal changes.

Good luck,
terry
