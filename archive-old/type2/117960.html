Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Freeplay - How to Fix?

Greetings,

Thanks for the tips on checking steering freeplay.  It sounds like the best 
course of action is to run a thorough check of the system before making any 
assessments one way or the other.  I'm sure reading up on the system in my 
Bentley manual will also shed some light on the finer points of steering and 
front end adjustment and replacement.

That's the great thing about The List....

Happy Friday Everybody!
