&gt; &gt;It appeared to me that about 30-50% of the autos in Mexico are air-cooled
&gt; &gt;bugs, busses, things, dune buggies, etc.  It was pretty cool.  

I was recently in Nicaragua and there are type II's everywhere mostly seem
to be aircooleds.. I had a rental T***ta but still caught myself waving a
few times
&gt; 
&gt; Even in that high temp environment, tropical not temperate, must not be too
&gt; many spec (Mexican specs and tolerances and metalurgy even) air cooled
&gt; motors burning up from overheating. I would guess that the only ones
&gt; destroyed from excess heat are the ones with aftermarket cooler setups or
&gt; other out of spec running.
&gt; 
&gt; I expect they all run pretty cool when maintained spec. This means also

DUH!?  nothing in Central America is maintained to spec, what is a spec?

&gt; combines with dust to clog the matrix and insulate the fins. Result,
&gt; diminished out of spec cooling system function. Eventually, the last grade

unpave roads off of CA1 is pretty common, dust rooster tails are common.
