    Hooey -- the airflow works just fine with them gone. They are
desirable if you live in a cold climate and want quicker warm ups in
winter, but there is simply no-way whatsoever that the engine is going
to overheat with them missing. 
    Actually, what really causes engines to overheat has little to do
with the airflow (except in the case of the fan belt breaking on a type
1, real obstructions, etc.) -- what really causes overheating is too
lean a fuel mixture (wrong jets and/or not enough exhaust back pressure)
and ignition advanced too far. Those two, and -- with solid lifters --
not checking valve adjustment every 2000 miles and not changing oil in
that same time period for those engines lacking a filter -- is what
really kills engines.

 
&gt; &lt;I do not know the use of
&gt; &lt;having them closed...Preheating in winter months?
&gt; 
&gt; Warming the engine up takes place in *all* seasons.  You don't want cooling
&gt; air preventing it; most engine wear takes place in the first few minutes of
&gt; engine running.

   Warming it up is something you need to just *do* anyway. Hey, it's a
great time to practice some yoga breathing techniques, meditating on
your breath increases mindfulness and calms you down -- wonderful things
to have happening before you start off driving a vehicle.
