Subject: Do you have bright headlights?

Hello,
  At Everybus I saw a bus drive in at night that headlights as bright as my
new Honda.  I think they were on one of the flag painted buses, but I'm not
sure which one.  If this was you, can you tell me what kind of light bulbs
you use?  Or if its not you and you have a suggestion for some bright
headlights, please let me know what brand you're using.
In the dark,
Dallas
