I went to the VW show at Shoreline Community College, up here in Seattle and
saw a magnificent split window.  The owner wasn't around and the bus wasn't
in the show but parked in the trading area.  Anyway, it was a 21 window
safari (?!)  (no clue as to the year) with the big sunroof in the middle and
a chrome and wood luggage rack on top, two toned with emerald green on the
bottom and white on top.  Ooooooooh!  I know it's an older bus than we talk
about here, but I don't want to get on the vintage bus list for just a
couple of questions. So...
Does anyone know of or have an e-picture of that bus or a similar one?  I'd
love to have it for my desktop picture for inspiration and as proof that not
all VW buses look like mine (rust museum).  Plus any info you might have
about those buses would be much appreciated.
