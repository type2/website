Subject: ball joint boot?

Does anyone know where I can get a set of ball joint boot seals?
That is the rubber thing that seals the ball joints between the
arm and ball.  I checked bus depot with no luck and a few other places.

I have a 77 bus.
If anyone could help me please p-mail off the list.

Alex,
