Subject: bolts

Ok. Today I realized that the three bolts that mount the rear engine where 
the oil pump is to the rear mustache shaped cross member are missing. Anyone 
know these bolt sizes exactly. I think two were 10mm and one 8mm (although Im 
not positive) but I definitely cant remember the length.

Any help is much appreciated.

Also, anyone have a thermostat bracket you'd be willing to part with?

Many thanks!
Melissa
