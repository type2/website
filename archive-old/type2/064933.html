Now that you have those blasted screws off, do something for next 
time.  Get a 6mm x 1mm tap and tap out those threaded holes.  Be very 
careful in the ones tappped into the aluminum head and alu/mag case.
I had 3 of 4 welded nuts messing up the screws on just ONE piece of 
tin.  Save yourself a LOT of trouble next time.  I also replaced 
almost all of them with bolts, so a socket can be used instead of 
rounding out the phillips slots.  A couple have too little clearance 
around head to accept a socket, they still need a phillips.

Be careful with an hammer driven impact wrench.  Be ABSOLUTELY sure 
of which way it is set, loosen or tighten, it can strip out the 
threads in the head or case in one hammer blow, yuck.

&gt; &gt;How the heck do you get those tin screws off? 
&gt; &gt;- - -
&gt; &gt;you mean the engine tine screws, right?   use a big screwdriver, or vice
&gt; &gt;grips on the screw to loosen, or vice grips on the big screwdriver while
&gt; &gt;pushing the screwdriver to the screwhead.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I've had to do is use one of those hammer driven impact wrenches
&gt; with a screw driver bit on the end. It'll loosen up just about anything.
