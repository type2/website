My '78 FI 2 liter has recently lost a lot of power, and the gas milage is 
down from 20 to about 17 mpg.

So I went and found my brand new analog dwell meter. Read the instructions, 
and put the wires to the coil.  First time using it tonight, the reading 
seemed to settle in around '60'. I think it should be about '50', right?

Could this be the cause of my power loss and drop in milage?

I have NEVWR replaced or adjusted points myself, always via a certified 
(read = expensive) mechanic.

Thanks for your thoughts and well wishes.
