I thought i'd reply to this since I've worked in the fire ext. industry for 
well over 6 years now.  First I agree that behind the drivers seat is the 
best place. Secondly I recommend a fire ext. with a rating of 2A 10BC this 
will put out any type of fire you could possibly have.  This ext. should be 
at least a 5pound ext., any of you that have anything less sorry:( I'd rather 
piss on a fire than use one any littler.  Thirdly buy one with a metal head; 
one that can be recharged.  Support your local fire ext. co. NOT wally world. 
 They can point you in the right direction in regard to brackets.  Remember 
when fighting a fire that overkill is NEVER bad!  Don't buy one with a 
plastic head or on that is disposable. Fourthly check it once a month they do 
leek down sometimes. Lastly, you don't have to turn them uoside down once a 
month to shake the powder this is a folk tale. If you have a fire ext. the 
powder cannot clump because their is no moisture in it, its charged with 
nitrogen (no moisture).  
PS. If you really wont to spend the money and protect your investment buy a 
clean-agent ext. E.g.. Halotron exts. this chemical leaves no mess, there's 
no cleanup, but its expensive. about 150- 200 clams for a 5 pounder. But well 
worth it.
Just my 2 cents!
Thanks all!
