Hi Michael,

Have a look at the vaccuum and electric connections on the carbs .

Assuming you have the original dual solex's, you need good vacuum 
connections or you will get the symptoms you describe. It is also 
critical to make sure that the wiring on the carbs is all present, 
correct and getting power.

Yesterday afternoon I took a trip downtown to buy a 77 Sunroof 
Automatic bus, and all the way there my 1.8L engine was surging and 
stumbling. It was a true PITA to manage in traffic. It idled OK, but 
power was unsteady and the bus seemed to be always &quot;hunting&quot; for a 
different speed. When I got to my destination I checked the carbs for 
vacuum and electrical glitches and discovered the spade connector to 
the D/S carb solenoid had let go and the wire was just resting against 
the contact.

Other carbs I can't advise on, but I am getting pretty familiar with 
the more common solex issues.

Happy trails,

&gt; I just attempted to give the 72 a tune up...it was kinda hiccuping 
&gt; (losing power to the point of feeling like it was facing resistance, 
&gt; like towing a sloppy trlr that was too heavy anyway) and backfired 
&gt; twice.  This set in all the sudden. One day it was fine, the next day 
&gt; it was sympomatic. I have replace the fuel filter, points, condenser, 
&gt; wires, plugs, dist cap, rotor and coil.  Now the darned thing will not 
&gt; start at all, it wants to, it will turn over like it is going to, but 
&gt; just a little back fire and nothing else.  I can't start the car to 
&gt; even attempt to set the timing or tach/dwell.  The plugs are torqued 
&gt; to 20 lbs and the gap on the plugs set to specs in the muir book. Does 
&gt; anyone have a clue as to what could be an issue? Any idea at 
&gt; all???thanks
