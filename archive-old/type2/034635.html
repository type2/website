 A while ago I said I was going to get my eberspacher running, and I did. All 
it took was a little cleaning, and I replaced the fuel lines. The old Fuel 
lines had deteriorated to the pont where it wouldn't work. Any way it works 
quite well now. 
 Now my question is this, on the heater boxes, there are some flaps, should 
these flaps be open or closed when I call for heat? When they are open, a 
fair amount of air escapes out of them, when they are closed I get more air 
at the dash, cold air.  I was on the freeway last week, and I had been going 
roughly 65mph for about 10 minutes and I turned on the heater, it seemed like 
I got warm air for 5 or so seconds, what is up with that? Any suggestions 
would be cool, and appreciated.
