&gt; I'm in SOCAL, so West would be better (but I could
&gt; always UPS them I suppose).

Believe it or not, I had very good luck with JC Whitney seat upholstery.
It was made by a company called &quot;Pony Express&quot; and I bought covers for
both my '71 bus and '69 bug.  The upholstery comes
pre-sewn and went onto the seats like a glove.  Your padding will
also probably need attention and it is available.

There are also several upholstery makers that may be able to
fill your needs directly.  TMI and Sewfine come to mind, but I have no
experience with either.

Installing the upholstery is not difficult.  Took me an afternoon to do
all the seats in a bug.
