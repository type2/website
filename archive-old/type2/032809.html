Subject: A Cautionary Tale of Titles - Part 3 - The Conclusion

As promised, I'm reporting back with the final chapter in this saga.  If you 
missed the first two installments, here's a brief summary.  I bought a non-op 
'82 air-cooled Vanagon AdventureWagen in July to restore.  After 2 months of 
trying to get the seller to produce a title, plus finally threatening him 
through my lawyer, he admitted that he had not registered the vehicle when he 
bought it, when it was running.  It not running now, after he got through 
working on the engine, and under Texas law, you have to have an inspection 
before getting a title, and the vehicle has to be running to get an 
inspection.  Catch 22.  He offered to register it AFTER I repaired it.  After 
posting this problem, someone suggested I contact International Title Service 
at www.its-titles_dot_com.  My great thanks to whoever that was.

To use International Title Service, you &quot;sell&quot; the vehicle to them (no money 
changes hand), and they register it in their name in New Hampshire.  For 
vehicles over 10 years old, NH requires only a Bill of Sale.  As part of the 
ITS package you have to submit a notarized statement that you do really own 
the vehicle and aren't trying to commit fraud, so you can't try this on your 
neighbor's new Porsche.  

I down-loaded the papers from the ITS site and sent them in along with a $120 
fee (cheaper than my lawyer) to ITS.  Within a week (miracle in itself) I had 
a valid New Hampshire registration, a Bill of Sale selling it back to me and 
an official to whom it may concern letter from the State of New Hampshire 
explaining that they did not issue titles on vehicles over 10 years old.  I 
took this to the local DMV.  The ladies looked at the papers, then looked in 
a thick reference book, called their supervisor and had a conference, but 
then they all agreed that my papers were in order and sufficient.  The only 
problem was since this transaction didn't fit the input form on their 
computer, they had to fill out a paper form manually.  The supervisor warned 
that might delay getting the title.  Today a little over 5 weeks later I 
received an official State of Texas title, and I am now completely legal and 
documented.

FWIW I also learned that beginning in September Texas now has a non-op title 
available for $15.  This will give you an official title but no registration 
sticker and no license plate.  Once your vehicle is running, you can get an 
inspection.  The good news is you don't have to pay sales tax when you apply 
for a non-op title, only when you register it.

Now that I have the title, the AdventureWagen is up for sale - see my 
separate post.  Hope this helps someone who has been tempted to restore a 
vehicle but has had doubts about getting a clean title.
