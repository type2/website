&gt; However I was wondering what kind I am exactly.
&gt; My Chassis # is 2232242534
&gt; So I know I am a 73 Type 2    am I a Kombi? Westy?

The first number, 2, tells you it is a type II.
The third number is the year, 1973.
The second number tells you the body style.
1 is panel. [no side windows beyond the front doors]
2 is station wagon.
3 is kombi and campmobile.
6 is pickup.
Yours is a 2, station wagon.

&gt; Also I'm not a pop top camper but a good portion of the midle section of
the
&gt; bus is a sunroof that slides back.  I don't know if thats original.  Is
it?

It would be original if it has a crank handle and you turn it to open the
sliding roof. Is this how it opens? You say it 'slides back'.
Behind the left seat on the panel is a small plate. It should have 4 rows of
numbers. What are the 3-digit numbers on the third row? If there are any on
the second row, what are they?
