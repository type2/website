Well, it looks like we'll have great weather for the camp out, which is a week
&gt;from today. I've heard from several folks who are coming, and I look forward to
seeing everyone there! Here are the details again:


Howdy all. Since there will not be a Busses on the Parkway this year, and yet
that first weekend in June (June 4-6) practically begs for a bus event in a
fantastic natural setting, I now humbly propose Busses by Jordan Lake for your
attendance. This will be a weekend of great bussing fun, and a chance to enjoy
your bus in the great outdoors. Plans are pretty informal right now, but as
interest shapes up, so may more activities. I've got a few prizes lined up, and
may do an award or two.
  Jordan Lake State Recreation Area is located about 15 miles west of Raleigh,
NC on highway 64. (Look for signs on the highway) It offers swimming, boating,
hiking trails, and bald eagle observation areas. We'll be in the Parker's Creek
area, which features 100 sites without hookups, many located on the waterside,
and 150 sites with water and electric hookups. There is also a beach/swimming
area there exclusively for campers, and a playground.
  Sites with hookups are $17.00 per night, and those without are $12.00 Gates
close at 9 pm, and alas, they aren't so flexible about that. You *might* be
able to get a ranger to let you in, but they didn't seem as nice as the folks
at Hagen Stone park.
   Check out
   http://ils.unc_dot_edu/parkproject/jordindex.html
 for more details on the park, and go to the Parkers Creek section for more
specific information.

   I'll probably head out there Thursday afternoon, in order to snag one of the
waterfront sites, which fill up pretty quickly...Everyone is welcome and
encouraged to attend! I hope to see you there...
