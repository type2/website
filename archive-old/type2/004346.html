Subject: waterproofing bus tent

Hi volks,
It's great to have the list up again. Thanks to all that worked so hard.

I recently purchased a used bus tent and found out at my first campout that it
is not waterproof anymore.  At least the top and sides.  The bottom is very
waterproof and holds all the water in well :(  The &quot;wax&quot;???  or whatever the
original coating on the walls and roof has creases and lines all thru it.

Has anyone found a way to rewaterproof?

TIA
