Hi George;

I had to install a Brazilian Solex 30/31 carb when my 1600SP engine was
re-rebuilt a couple of years ago, and had similar good results right out of
the box.  I haven't fiddled with jets at all.  My tailpipe indicates its
running a tad rich, but the plugs look OK and I'm getting ~21MPG on freeway
runs at 60-65MPH [true/corrected].  The bus is a '70 poptop Westy.

My only real complaint is that it has a tendency to seep fuel from various
joints and apertures.  Not very much, just enough to discolor the outside
and make its presence known.

My guess would be that the foreign material you found in your carb was
already there when you bought it, an artifact of the manufacturing/assembly
process.

Did you have a rebuild kit for the 30/31, or just carefully re-use the
original gaskets, etc.?  I have a couple of kits for Solex 28 through 34
PICT carbs, and the gaskets in them don't look like they'll fit the
Brazilian unit.

I've written before about FRAM's marine [gasoline] fuel filter, with
replaceable cartridge and drain tap for water removal.  Another filter I've
used on marine engines, including outboards, has a clear Pyrex tube body,
metal end fittings, and a replaceable filter insert.  These come in
different models for different fuel line sizes, and are usually available at
Schuck's, etc.  These also trap water, and have a much finer filter medium
than the typical
plastic-bodied inline filters.

FWIW.....
