new to the list - please excuse the chattyness of this post.

friday may 21 westbound I-80, 9 miles east of Truckee, on the way to
sacramento to a belated wedding reception - engine saisen, saisir, sacire,
sezzen, siezure.

had it towed to Downtown Truckee Safeway [*have* to get AAA] for $95, only
had $91 in my pocket but the guy let me slide.

ok, i admit, i was a bit anxious to get out of Carson City that afternoon,
and i may have been a bit hasty checking my valves... i also changed the
oil, and there is a slight possiblity the previous owner [mine for 2 weeks]
had non-detergent oil in it.

i rebuilt a mid year '71 when i was a junior in HS - brought to life from 2
cracked heads and virtually dead #3.. well, i suppose they were all dead, i
made it run in it's condition and i didn't go around the block more than
once for fear of it exploding into an oily ball of flame...
couple of questions:
been a while since i've been up to my elbows...
now i've got this '68 campmobile and i've already killed her.

anyone got the hot lead on a motor?
anyone local can help me get it towed to sacramento [much better home-shop
there]?
any possiblity i can get away with doing a top end only on the thing...?

premature here i'm thinking... i have to get the engine out, the tin off,
heads and cylinders off and just take a look eh?

i suppose i just wanted to make contact with the list to verify there
*were* going to be 80 to a 100 messages a day... i haven't seen one.
