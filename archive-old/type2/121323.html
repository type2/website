Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

&lt;&lt; One thing that always bugs me about &quot;cheap bus&quot; stories is this: 
imagine getting on a plane for a flight. You taxi down the taxiway and 
the pilot comes on the intercom and says:

&quot;Welcome aboard flight 2039 to Miami.

&quot;Looks like we'll have good weather for our flight today.

&quot;We got this plane for less than a million and haven't had to put any 
money into maintenance or repairs.&quot;
 &gt;&gt;

My guess would be the reality of both Busses and planes (and trains)
is that the maintenance is a result of &quot;risk management&quot; and reg-
ulations and costs...Regulations often result from catastrophes...
After all, instead of a well-maintained Bus, you could be driving a
well-maintained Pinto on Firestone tires (again...), and still have
disastrous results... ;-(
