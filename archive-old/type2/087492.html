Subject: rust blemish around front grill

Thanks everyone for your great suggestions re: driving speeds and warmup
procedures. I'm learning a lot very quickly on this list! 

Thought I'd throw out my next question - on my new '71 Westy, there is a
black front grill. On the lower lip of the recession in which the grill
sits are a couple of rust bubbles...water tends to accumulate in this
lower lip, accentuating the problem. After rains, there is a noticeable
streaking down the front of the van from those rust bubbles, discoloring
the paint. It took me quite a while to remove the streaks that had
accumulated from the PO leaving it sitting outside all winter in Ontario 
;( , and I'd like to prevent this from happening. 

Should I pull the grill off and try to get rid of the rust bubbles? i.e.
sanding/repainting? Hopefully it won't need any bondo... 

If anyone else has had this problem, I'd love to hear a solution. 

Thanks again; 
Dan Curran
