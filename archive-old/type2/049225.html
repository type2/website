Subject: [T2] Air-cooled VW Gathering in MD.

Hi everyone.  

I am trying to have a Volkswagen gathering in Ocean City, MD right before or 
at the beginning of the summer.  I've tried once just to get one started with 
some local busses and bugs, but had only 2 that were interested.  If I get a 
lot of responses I'll set it all up and give out definite details.  OC would 
be a great place for a VW gathering so I hope everyone emails me!!!  Also - 
tell friends with any air-cooled VW's about the idea nad to email me!  Thanks 
everyone 

Tracy
