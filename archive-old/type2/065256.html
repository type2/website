Subject: Problems: '78 Fuel Injection

Hi Everybody!
This is my first post to everybody on the list. I have read your list for
close to a year now using the gopher/www servers. I have E-mailed many of
you guys about individual things. Recently my '78 bus developed a problem.
Let me see if I can point out the scenerio to you:
After a day of tuning up, my bus was running better than it ever had! I
finally got brave enough to do my timing, and replace my points and
condensor. Nearly a year ago, Temperature Sensor two went dead, so I
replaced it with an aftermarket one, but it always read the wrong
resistance at room temperature. It was supposed to read 2500 ohms of
resistance at 68 degrees F but read 1000 ohms, so my bus was always
difficult to get started when cold. I replaced this sensor with the
correct one. This was the same day I tuned up my distrubitor. The next
day, for the first time since I got my bus it fired right up when cold,
and idled so smoothly, it was really beautiful (tears in my eyes) (; 
I was so happy. So I ran my bus around town and it ran better than
ever.... until five days later. I was coming home from school, and while
taking a
left hand turn, my bus hiccuped. It galloped and bucked, like someone had
taken the life from it. I though, maybe a little water in the gas line, no
problem. So I kept going, and when coming up the hill to my house, I put
my clutch in to stop at a stop sign, and the bus died. Not suddenly, it
just quietly quitted, like when you turn the key off. When I tried to
start it, it wouldn't catch. After pausing for about 1 minute, I got the
bus to start, but it would not idle, and would die below 2000 rpms. I got
it home ( about 1/10 of a mile) and parked it. It died again as I pulled
into the driveway. I started it back up again, and it would idle, but soon
began to cough and misfire, and choke. It died again after about two
minutes of idleing.
I went inside and ate a bowl of Lucky Charms, and then went back out. It
started and idled okay for about 10 minutes, then began to cough and
choke. I let it cool off again and it did the same thing. So when the
engine has cooled off for a few minutes, it idles okay, I Stress okay,
because the engine has not since idled nearly as smooth as it did the
first day after I did the points/condensor.
I have checked timing, and quadroupled checked everything elso that I did,
and it all looks great! My bus okay on cool days on the highway, but
still too rough for my satisfaction. I can't figure it out, and I need
your help! Oh by the way, while the bus was running great, twice it died
right after startup while idleing.
The engine has 156,000 miles on it with all the FI stuff still there. I
still have all four cylinders firing. I just can't figure this out. I
replace most of my vacuum lines hoping it would run right, but to no
avail.

Please help me! I am out of ideas and very frustrated. I love my bus, and
I am afraid to drive it, and I miss it dearly! (I'm sure you understand
this)

Thankyou very much in advance,
John Tracy
