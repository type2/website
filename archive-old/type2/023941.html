Subject: really low idle and backfiring
Message-ID: &lt;6b9dc667.246476fd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I just started my 77 (2.0L FI) westy for the first time in about a month and 
it barely will stay at idle, just barely turning over.  Until it warmed up it 
kept stalling (many many times).  I took it out for a local drive and it 
seems to drive fine but whenever I go down a hill with it in gear it seems to 
backfire.  It's at least some sort of popping noise.  It even makes the 
popping sound when coming down from higher RPMS.

I JUST replaced the fuel lines in the engine compartment (after reading all 
those horrible burning bus stories).  And I made sure to use the Fuel 
Injected lines.

Is there something I could have done while changing fuel lines?? The last 
time it ran it idled fine (after the token warm up period).  

Any help would be appreciated.

BTW thanks for all the responses to the water in the closet post. 

Thanks again,
Mike
