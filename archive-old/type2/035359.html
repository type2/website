Subject: oil filter type1&lt;-&gt; type4 ?

Hi,

I just got my first type4 engine and I was wondering about oil filter
compatibility. I have some unused filters for my old type 1 engine that had
full flow filtration. One is a Fram HP1 and the other is a from PH8A. Can I
use them?The one on my type 4 engine is definately of a smaller volume but
is that an issue if the threads are the same?
