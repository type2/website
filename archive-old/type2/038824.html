&gt; &gt; The spindle does turn at high RPM, but the edge
&gt; &gt; speed is no higher than
&gt; &gt; that of other power tools that use larger diameter
&gt; &gt; tools.  A 7&quot; circular
&gt; &gt; saw only has to turn 4300RPM to get the same edge
&gt; &gt; speed.  Eye protection
&gt; &gt; is definitely a good idea for all of these things!
&gt; 
&gt; This is true, but there are some pretty serious
&gt; differences between a circular saw and a Dremel;-);
&gt; it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges... The
&gt; saw has a base-plate that not only acts as a guide,
&gt; but a shield, as well (in case a tooth, or wood
&gt; fragments go flying). Also, a saw blade is going to be
&gt; a wee bit harder to shatter than a cut-off wheel!

I had an abrasive cutoff wheel in mind, but you're right that a circular
saw has a nice guard.

The scariest tool in my arsenal is a large disc grinder.  Big flat
composite grinding disk, 7500+ RPM, and no guard.  You had better know
what you're doing before you pull that trigger!  It takes about 5 seconds
to wind down from speed, too.

 &gt; &gt; And the biggest difference is in how
they are used... &gt; when you use the Dremel, you have a tendency to look
&gt; straight down on the cutting wheel/attachment so that
&gt; you can see what you're doing (not the smartest thing
&gt; to do, but it happens), and there is *nothing* between
&gt; that wheel and your eyes/face.... if it shatters,
&gt; there's nothing to stop the fragments from doing you
&gt; some real damage.

I've pretty much broken myself of that habit.  Since I spent a lot of time
in the aircraft industry, I figured out the meaning of that red stripe
that they paint on the fuselage of aircraft.  The same applies to my
rotating tools.  Dremel cutoff disks aren't all that bad because they are
of composite constructions, but the grinding wheels can and will come
apart.  Unless I need a really narrow slit, I tend to us the trusty
carbide burr which has a lot less edge speed.  Still, it throws fine metal
shavings that are hell if you get them in your eye and I'm a believer in
safety glasses.  Since I wear glasses, I use a product called &quot;visorgogs&quot;
that are available from safety supply companies.
&gt; I've had too many of those wheels come
&gt; apart and go flying...and yes, I've had them bounce
&gt; off my goggles, leaving nasty dents as they go!

I don't doubt it!  I had a 7 inch abrasive cutoff disk come apart in my
circular saw.  it punched a hole in the magnesium guard!  I don't even
want to contemplate what a grinding wheel does.
 
&gt; I was once cutting a piece of aluminum with a jig-saw,
&gt; when the blade snapped, sending shards of aluminum all
&gt; over hell's-half-acre. One of the pieces bounced off
&gt; of my face, inside of my safety-glasses, off the lense
&gt; (of the glasses), and into my eye.
&gt;... 
&gt; I spent a total of four hours in two emergency rooms
&gt; (seperate visits to seperate hospitals) that night,

&gt; So, like I said, be careful....your eyes have almost
&gt; *no* ability to heal themselves from injury; once the
&gt; damage is done, it's usually permanent...

As a science teacher, I am also pretty anal about eye safety.  I just
installed a $400 UV cabinet to sterilize my class set of safety goggles.
The science teachers in my district have begged for this safety gear for a
decade, but it took an accident (not my student, thank goodness) to get
the
administrators to cough up the bucks.  They saved a few thousand on safety
gear, but now are looking on a couple of million to settle the tort case.

Taking this to a personal level, an investment of $10 on safety goggles
can save you thousands on medical care (not to mention pain!)
