Hi Volks,

David &lt;david_at_reuters.ee&gt; wrote to the List:

&gt; I am curious if anyone on the list has a pick up with an expanded 
&gt; wooden (plyboard) tray like the one here
&gt; http://www.bulli_dot_org/t2ig/archive/brochure/6708-1/page2627.html
&gt; I have a 1973 version of the one featured in this VW T2a Sales 
&gt; Brochure.

I know of several in existence today, and they used to be a common 
sight on German streets in the '70s and '80s.  However, they are rare 
today, even more so than normal pick-ups that aren't common anymore 
either.

&gt; I had thought that it was non-orignal, so was very surprised. Did you
&gt; guys in the US ever get something like this?

They were available from Volkswagen; the option code is M201 as found
on our old site at
http://members.tripod_dot_com/~t2ig/archiv/mcodetable_e.html

I'd doubt they were available in the US, but they definitely are 
original.  I *think* the tray was made by Westfalia BTW.  They were 
available with the Vanagon pick-up too, and I think with the Splitty 
as well.  Where are you located, and where did your truck come from?

&gt; a big thanks to the Community of Interest T2 for putting the brochure
&gt; up.

You're welcome :-)

Yours,
    Erik.
