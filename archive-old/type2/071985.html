Subject: .006 / .007

set the valves last weekend, dug out my .007 feeler and set and reset the
valves until they were as close as I could get them, until the .006 would
fit but the .007 was left out in the cold. I was happily surprised at how
well the '76 ran after that treatment, it was well worth the time getting
the gap as close to perfect as I possibly could...
