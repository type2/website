Subject: flickering battery light
Message-ID: &lt;0.77672272.254284dc_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Before I trouble shoot the dirty way, I want to make sure its not a fluke.  
The red battery light is flickering, and sort of (low) glowing.  When the 
turn signals are activated the light brightens and returns to normal once 
off.  It doesn't come on for anything else.  Today it started flickering at 
low rpms and quit on the highway.  I thought oh great another day down, but 
it went away after about 8 miles on the interstate and didn't come 
back,(except for turn signals).  What gives shouldn't it come on for all 
electrical draws and accessories?  Any advice would be appreciated.  I 
already know how to trouble shoot manually just curious.
Peace Out
