Tom,
    $300 is just a starting point.  $150 for the filter, $100 for the Cat,
up to $400 for a quality, factory style exhaust.  I've looked at doing some
of the same work,  but the $$$$ and twins on the way keep holding me back.
I need a filter, muffler and tail pipe myself.  Good luck, and if you find
any GREAT deals please let me know.
