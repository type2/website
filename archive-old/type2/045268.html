Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt engine won't start - UPDATE -

&gt;&gt;arms were barely moving, and concluded that my hydraulic lifters needed to
&gt;&gt;be bled. his prescription was to first try cranking it a lot until the oil
&gt;&gt;light went out or the battery went dead. repeat as necesary to acheive oil
&gt;&gt;pressure. if that doesn't work, take off the rockers, pushrods, pushrod
&gt;&gt;tubes, and lifters and bench bleed them. not hard but very time consuming.
&gt;&gt;if THAT doesn't work i've got bigger problems.

It goes to be said that you should remove the plugs for this cranking to
save the starter and the battery.  Good always for a pre-run oil pressure pump
up.

However lifters should have been installed solid bled, if they weren't you got
NO IDEA where they are and how did you adjust them when you built it up?

Still I've never seen the case where even a goodly number of unbled lifters
would cause it to not catch at all.  That to me mean #1 no ignition, #2 no
gas,
but you seem to have covered that.

I would say once more make SURE the ignition is right, some weird for
instances that even get the best of us, when Dolan and I swapped Vanagon
engines his had a bug 050 in it, I timed it, had everything right, but the way
the bug and bus dizzies differ the wires were 180 degrees out, I never
actually
looked at a rocker to see which I was timing to (1 or 3) and it just sputtered
away.  It was very late, we had been working for 2 days, next morning I
realized
the mistake almost instantly, the night before I chased down all kinds of 
ridiculous &quot;problems&quot; I was sure were causing my grief.  The bug into bus
dizzy thing is real common, to get the dizzy into a nice position I eventually
rotated the drive gear way off where you would normally need it in a T4.
These things get even the worst of us, I knew the problem could happen but
I was SURE I had it right, didn't bother to check reality.  BTW rotating the
dizzy was insufficient in this case to get it to catch (pretty obviously at
180
out and all)

I'm sure not saying this is the case in point, but make DAMN sure you got
spark to the correct cylinder at the correct time, and you got gas before you
go pulling all those lifters out.  BTW you can of course tell if they are bled
by pusing on the knurled end of the rockers with a screwdriver or your finger
to see if they move.  If they do, rather extensive instructions for
correcting the
problem in the library, by yours truly.
