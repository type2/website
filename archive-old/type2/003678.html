Hey volks,
Last time I did my CVs I had my mechanic walk me thru it and he showed =
me what to do.  Well less than a year later one boot ripped (I switched =
to the Rockford boots, twice as thick, much better) But any ways, I used =
Bentley this time to redo it.  Mr. Bentley says to take out the dished =
washer.  My mechanic had told me to leave it on.  I took it off to see =
and I had more than a little play.  I was not comfortable with this play =
so I left the washer on.  What are the pros and cons????

This is on the SnoopyBus which is mostly a 73.
