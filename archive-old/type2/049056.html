Hi Jamie;

We've put ~200,000 miles on a '68 Westfalia, and another 100,000 on a '70
Westfalia.  Both buses have served as our primary family vehicle  --  daily
drivers and haulers in a big way.  Over the years we've replaced/rebuilt a
few engines, and I used to hold out for a &quot;bus&quot; case with the rear mounting
bolt lugs/bosses.  These cases are getting tough to find in decent shape in
N. America, since even the newest are pushing 30 years old.

Our most recent rebuild is based on a 1976 Bug case.  It's the latest alloy,
the same as is used for Type 4 engine cases.  Basically aluminum rather than
magnesium alloy like the older bus cases.  This case had never been rebuilt
before and was in near-perfect condition, so we just did a minimum cut line
bore to clean things up and ready it for assembly.

At first I was quite wary about using an adapter mount at the rear of the
engine to allow bolting to the bus's rear engine support bar.  The engine
builder came up with a very stout, well engineered and manufactured, steel
adapter that uses engine case through-bolts in addition to the typical
attachment at the oil pump cover.  It includes a leg/bracket that wraps
under the case to provide positive support in addition to the various
bolts/studs.  This arrangement now has ~20,000 miles of hard use on it, and
there's no sign of loosening/flexing/etc.

If I were putting together a 1600cc bus engine now I wouldn't even consider
using a &quot;correct&quot; bus case.  The late Bug cases are much better with dual
relief, the newer alloy, typically far fewer miles, and often no previous
rebuild and/or line bore.  Another plus is that these castings have been
&quot;seasoned&quot; and are thus more stable than a new, unused, case.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I need a 1600 &quot;A&quot; series case with the 3 bosses for 68 and later busses.
I want to build a new engine that is going to haul The Love Bug trailer
around.  Anyone around Philly have one lying around?  &lt;&lt;
