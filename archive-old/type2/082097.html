Hello Everyone--

I am in the process of replacing my intake manifold on a 1600 dp and I need 
to remove the Generator. However...I cannot loosen the Pulley nut...I am 
putting the screwdriver in the slot...and turning the wrench 
counterclockwise...but it will not budge...tried soaking in WD40 but 
nothing....Just looking for some ideas...I have thought about cutting the the 
belt...pulling the Generator...taking the Generator to a shop and having them 
use an impact wrench on it? Good idea or no? Thanks everyone...
