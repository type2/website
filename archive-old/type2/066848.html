&gt; I was crawling under the bus today, wiring the heat exchangers open, and
&gt; I noticed that the muffler is indeed as cruddy as it sounds. And the
&gt; heat risers are kind of messed up. So it's time to replace...
&gt; 
&gt; So what's the price/convenience/performance ratio on this? And where
&gt; should I buy it from?
&gt; 
Well i bought a bug pack extractor/Muffler for a bout 70 dollars....
As for convenience its nice to be able to replace the muffler with 
removing the whole extractor unit( i.e if they both dont wear out at 
the same time) , and as for the performance ratio it depends on the 
muffler. You will notice it will have a lower tone to it and it will
be noiser, but usually after the instalation of the header it will 
produce a little more low end torque. I installed mine about a year 
ago and am quite happy with it... (except for the noise!!)

anyways hope this info is usful....
