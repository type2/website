Subject: Water in brake booster

Hi gang,
    All this talk of fluid in the booster reminds me of something that
happened a number of winters ago when we still had our '77.  My wife Kathy
came home one very cold day and said that it seemed like the bus didn't want
to &quot;go&quot; even though the engine was running fine.  I thought to myself that
it was probably just the ice, snow and slush on the road making driving
difficult.  I did decide to go outside and have a look, and good thing too!
I could smell the heat coming off the rear brakes from about 15 feet away.
Not 1, but both rear wheels were too hot to touch.
    After letting things cool down, and putting on my insulated cover-alls
(no garage) I jacked up the bus and pulled the rear drums only to find
nothing wrong.  OK  I put that all back together and crawled under the bus
toward the master cylinder.  Everything looked good there too, now what.  I
know! Brake fluid absorbs moisture, I bet some of that moisture is starting
to freeze up and expand there-by causing pressure in the circuit to the rear
wheels.  I got out my trusty heat gun, propped it up aimed at the master
cylinder and left it for several hours.  That evening I checked the brakes
and all is fine.  Good, now to bleed all four wheels to get some fresh fluid
in the system.  My wife worked the pedal while I bled and bled and bled at
the wheels.  We went to bed that night knowing all was well in busdom.
    Next morning we warm up the bus and head out to do errands only to find
that it won't &quot;go&quot;.  What the H#_at__at_ !
Now I'm POed and not fooling around any more.  Off comes the master cylinder
and I back bleed all 4 brake circuits until there can't possibly be any
moisture left in the lines.  Back under the bus to put the master cylinder
on I look into the booster.
ICE!  Yep, the bottom of the booster had ice in it.  The ice was pushing on
the diaphragm and actuating the brakes a little.  How the heck did water get
in there?  Well low and behold, on the front side of the booster there is a
hose that goes to ambient air in the drivers wheel well.  The end of the
hose should have been tucked into an opening in the body work, but wasn't.
So I took off the booster and brought it inside to thaw out.  While waiting
for the ice to melt I went back out and took care of the offending hose.
    From here it was a quick fix.  Reassemble the brake system and bleed,
clean up and shower, and them warm up with a good hot cup of joe was all
that was left to do.  The only thing I'm still not sure off is the moral of
this story.  It could be to check the brake booster hose and make sure the
end is enclosed in the body work or, more likely, the moral is to NEVER
doubt your wife.

Have a good day everyone, even those of you living  where it never gets cold
enough for this to happen.  :-)
