&gt; Gravity isn't that great for hydronic home heating systems either. Adding a

don't think so, my three bedroom house in Maryland rarely uses more than
about 300gals of oil a year to heat.

it's a 90 year old house it has a coal furnace converted to oil
burner. the heat is quiet and gentle no cold spots or fluctuations in
heat.

which to throw in the bus content is why it interests me to use water in
the bus

&gt; I really like the water (anti-freeze, of course) based system a lot better than
&gt; the oil.

yeah I have never considered the oil heat
