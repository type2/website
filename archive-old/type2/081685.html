Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for door sliper piece 77 bus

&gt;I have a customer that needs a latch piece for her 77.  It is the &gt;piece with
the roller and that metal piece that attaches to the &gt;door.  Her door came off
the track, and she forced it shut, thus &gt;bending it up.

There are three pieces with rollers on a bay sliding door.

Top, middle, or bottom?
