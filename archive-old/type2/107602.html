Subject: best way to lower a 71 transporter

Owning a VW is new to me so foregive me if i don't know the terminology.
I have a 1971, 8 passenger bus (transporter?) and will fixing it up this year.
I would like to lower and restore it. but don't have any stores in Santa
Barbara. So here are my following question:
1) Are there different ways to lower it?
2) If there is, which is the best way?
3) On average about how much does it cost?
4) Are there any good companies to buy restoration or after market parts
from?
5) Can you buy the proper interior paint in a spray can?

Sorry if this sounds kinda cheap useing a spray can but liveing in S.B. is not
cheap... doing the best i can with what i got!

Thanks for time in responding!!!
