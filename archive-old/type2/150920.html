Subject: tICKING NOISE

Well figured out what it was after doing a complete tune up- which my plugs 
were loose.  The ticking was an exaust leak- which was heater box connection 
to the heads -both sides were loose.  Wierd I only had one response to my 
problem.  Anyways figured it out myself with a little help from my friends 
at the local vdub shop-Always Vdub.  It is now running smooth as a whistle!  
Has this ever happened to anyone loose exaust from heater box?  Just curious 
if not you better check yours.
Peace in Ptown
