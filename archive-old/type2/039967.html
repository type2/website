Subject: Can't-Find-Gear (Shift Coupling?!?)

Howdy All-

Circa 18 mo., 5000 mi. and 9 states ago, my  '73 camper (Weber carb)
developed a can-not-find-the-gear problem for the first time.  Couldn't
find first or second, just pushed against semi-mush. I was
(unfortunately) on the road between, and ended up having a cheap r&amp;r job
to replace the needle bearing (?) (guides shift assembly inside front of
tranny?). Inexpensive, but he ruins my engine compartment heat seal...
Problem goes away, shifting is nice and smooth for a while.
Recently I started having trouble *finding the gear* when shifting down
into second from third, and less luck double-clutching into first.  Then
trouble finding second out of first.  Got bad so that I parked it and
started researching.
Read up on shifter assembly.  Check it out-first above pan (new place
for me in my bus) at front ball&amp; socket joint.  Looks really good under
pan, almost like new- shift assembly feels nice and snug resists hand
torque side/side.  All grease on b&amp;s jount has a wonderful amber color.
Even the odd H plate seemed ok -although possbly out place?  How would I
test that?  The shift rod looks good both into and out of long tube
(nylon bushings?&lt;yikes&gt;)
At rear shift coupling (U-shaped joining) all pins present-seems fine.
Only around 4 mil. play side to side.
In short, I could not find the obvious problem that would dispel the
sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.  Trasmission stuff scares me
bad.   First time I had troubles, in the parkinglot of the mall, I
replaced tranny oil, and not single shaving on magenetic plug.

Other things that have occured to me: possible distortion in the
position of the transmission relative the line of shift rod?  Would this
be obvious if this were my problem?
Since Cheap mechanic ruined my heat seal, the quality of the original
repair is suspect.  Maybe needle bearing failed due to improper
seating=excessive wear?
Is there a more specific (quantifiable) test I can do of shift rod
motion?  A definite distance from the front to back?
Anything else I'm missing here?

Thanks,  Daryl
