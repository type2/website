Subject: Re: [T2] Retractable seat/shoulder belt retrofit

This is a True Story. Mine are oriented horizonally instead of vertically. 
They function mostly okay, except that they catch /very/ easily, so you have 
to be gentle putting them on. It's annoying but not the end of the world.

&gt;Apparently the retractor reels must be oriented in a specific manner in 
&gt;order to function correctly.  Something to do with the effects of gravity 
&gt;on the reel's innards.
