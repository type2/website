When I 'hit the list' several days ago with my drive train noise problem
after adjusting the torsion bars one 'notch', I must thank all those who
responded...

I bit the 'bullet' today and replaced all four CV joints...As my 73 Westy
has approx 150K miles, and I had already ordered rear hub bearings and
seals, I replaced those as well...let me tell you, this whole process was
one 'fun' project to do today while trying to wait on my regular customers
at my Battery shop....but I got it done and all is again well in type-2
'world'...all the RH turn clanks and bangs went away, as did the vibrations
under power above 1st gear...It's now time to pack all our gear for our
upcoming trip to Mexico next week to get down there where it's WARM! (I've
already shot six holes in my freezer, for you JB fans)...Also, we are going
to pick up our new 'slider' canvas top to fill our 'westy pop-top' roof hole
down in Phoenix as we pass through town - that should be a big 'plus' for
the bus, when we are down in Manana land!...

We'll have to sign off the list for awhile, or we'll come home to a
'jillion' posts from all you nice type-2 er's - I like to read your 'mail'
but I don't think my eyeballs would hold out...Hasta la bye, bye...for a
couple of weeks, anyway...
