Subject: [T2] bus for sale

Hi Folks, I'm putting my 79 Campmobile up for sale. It has 79k original
miles on it and I'm the third owner. Second owner had it since 1980. Engine
was rebuilt at 70k. I've owned it 2 years and put on new gas shocks and a
set of Yokohama 370's.
It runs excellent and looks very good too. I can e-mail pictures to those
who are interested. I have complete service records from the previous owner.
Very nice clean bus. Interior is nearly mint. Would like to see it go to a
list member if at all possible.
$ 3700. seems fair. Bus is in western New York state near Rochester.
