Terry,

Arrrrgggh!  Can you give us a *real* name?

I would like some of this stuff, but if I go into AutoZone and say, &quot;I 
need some GM sealer&quot;  they are gonna look at me like I'm from Mars...or 
worse yet, from Venus!

Might work better at NAPA, but I generally can't get to one of those after 
work before they close.

Does it really say &quot;GM&quot; on it or is it from someone else?

Name, Name, Name!!!!


LOL!  

Cheers, dave
