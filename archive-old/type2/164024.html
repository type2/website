Subject: Westy Tank Water Pump

Hello, Volks:

Is there supposed to be a hose clamp on the hose coming from the Westywater
tank pump going to the faucet?  I did some Spring cleaning on the Aardvark
today, filled up the tank and had a small leak (drip).  I got in there and
moved the hose more securely on the fitting but thought there might be a
hose clamp missing.  Very difficult to get two arms in there.

See the pics of the Aarvark ready to go and the hose coming from the pump.

Thanks for any info.
