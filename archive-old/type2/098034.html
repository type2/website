Subject: Re: [T2] Seized engine

Seems like you might have pinched a bearing (being
hard to turn after O/H), the fritcion overheated the
engine ,thinned the oil, light on-engine stops. You
may be able to get away with just new main &amp; rod
bearings and a new gasket set, but it will be just
like a new rebuild. Phil(unless you had a massive oil
leak and this would lock it down for no oil.)
