Friends-

After long consideration we have decided this bus is not for us at this
time. So, just to remind anyone who might be interested, the shell is a 77
Sunroof model, VERY little rust and that surface only, no interior behind
the front seats. No trans, motor or drive shafts. It will roll, so you can
hook it up and tow it home. Lots of good body panels here. No title.

Also a complete 2.0 Ltr FI engine, history unknown.

Bus only is $50. Motor only or motor and bus for $300.

THIS IS NOT MY BUS!! Call the owner for more info. Jeremy Scott
270-388-0865  Kuttawa, KY

Hope somebody needs it,
Dave
