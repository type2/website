Subject: Carb Question

Greetings Esteemed and Knowledgeable List,

	A few days ago while I was reading thru the literature I have about my
carbs (Weber DFV 228's), I noticed that the literature states:  &quot;The DFV 228
is equipped with a port vacuum outlet and can be used with vacuum advance
distributors for increased fuel economy.  The outlet can be capped off when
using a mechanical advance distributor.&quot;
	Does anyone have experience with these carbs?  Will the amount of vacuum
provided allow the use of OEM style dual vac advance distributor on a '73
1700cc type 4 engine?  Will this give me better performance / mileage than
the 050 dizzy I am using now (I am guessing a resounding yes).
	Ideally, I would like to run a rebuilt vacuum advance distributor w/ a
Compufire ignition, but don't know where to start, or if it would even be
possible with these carbs.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

	Best Regards,
	Jay Brown
