Got my engine out, replaced all the seals (forgot to order a flywheel
seal -so the engine is still in the driveway).
I cleaned up all the tin. But when I pulled my fan assembly off I couldn't
separate the two halves. It seemed to be stuck up on the dipstick tube. I
wanted to clean it as it's caked with oil and dirt on the inside, but I
didn't want to force it. Is there a trick to getting it apart?
