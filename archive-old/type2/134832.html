Subject: Re: [T2] Help! - Now it's gas in MY oil!

From: &quot;john kolak&quot; &lt;jkolak_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Always a good concern, so we run locking gas caps. Our neighborhood is
&gt; not the best!

I wouldn't characterize my neighborhood as &quot;not the best&quot;, but someone
living here is probably the thief that misappropriated the half a tank that
prompted me to buy my locking gas cap.

Sort of brings you up short when you leave to do an errand and the needle
never moves to where you left it the last time you drove the bus. :O~
