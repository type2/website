Subject: 1929cc will it work?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hey all,
  As some of you know I am working on a Cali converted type 4 engine for my 71
Westy. The parts I have available to work with are what I want to use. I have a
2.0L Vanagon engine with a good crank and rods, but even though the case is
perfect I can not use it due to the beather casting. It has bad pistons and
cylinders and bad heads. I also have a good 1.8L. The heads are good and so are
the P&amp;C's. I will be useing the case form this motor(or one of my 1.7Ls) for
the build up. I would like to use the 2.0L crank and rods with the 93mm Ps&amp;c's
from the 1.8L to make a 1929cc. Is this possible? I figure I will have to lower
the compression ratio, but to what? This will be for a Westy so I need the
torque of the longer crank. Any sugestions?
