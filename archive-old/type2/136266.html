Subject: Re: [T2] Possible to elimate the power brake servo?

Yes, I know how hard it is to stop a vehicle not using the power brake servo.  But you miss the point of my question.  My question is there a way to switch to another master cylinder such as the 68-70 and have normal non power brakes thus saving the $159 cost of a rebuilt servo.
 
Was wondering if this 68-70 MC would work in conjunction with the front discs...
 
Thanks

Before eliminating the power brake system, take a drive in another bus,
coast it with the clutch, put it in neutral, cut the engine and try to stop
it with the brakes. You'll be horrified how hard it is without the booster.
