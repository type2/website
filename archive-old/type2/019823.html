Steve and list:
Not quite right.
68 and 69 are the same (and will bolt into a 64-67 if you want ball
joints.)
70 through 79 are the same pattern EXCEPT 70's in the U.S. usually don't
have a vacuum booster, so you'd have to add or remove the bracket
depending on which way you are going. 71 and 72 have different spindles,
calipers and rotors (smaller).
I'm in Iowa.
I've bought bare axle beams from a good Phoenix junkyard

for $125 stripped and wrapped in cardboard. This was a few years ago.
This way they'll ship UPS easily, without the parts you don't need. I
got really good service from these guys and the part was like new (from
a  68-69 type 2).
