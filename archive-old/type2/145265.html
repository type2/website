 Hi all,
 I just purchased a 1976 Hardtop Westie that has only
 the sink and icebox. I'm
 not sure what model this is, but I'd like to know.
 Anyhow, the two vent
 windows along the drivers side needs replacing as I
 am going to replace the
 window rubbers afer having it primed and painted. Ik
 any of you have a set of
 good (chromed) set, I would be interested. Also, is
 there a better set of
 window rubbers to buy? I want to do this chore just
 once, even though it may
 be more up front.
 
 Thanks, and again if any of you know what model I
 have, I would appreciate hearing from you.

That would be the P-21 model IF it is a Westfalia
Campmobile. It should show that on your M code plate.
The M code plate will be hard to read because it is
riveted to the air duct under the dash on the left
side.

BTW, campers have black vent windows. Buses have
chrome vent windows. I am a LOT puzzled as to why you
have TWO vent windows on the drivers side. A real
Westfalia will have jalousie windows in the middle of
each side.

What are the first 3 numbers of your vin?  226 or 236?
