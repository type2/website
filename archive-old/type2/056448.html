Subject: Women Are Fragile?

List,

I know it's not friday but...
Recently I took my westy (I've had for 1 1/2 months) in to the guy that I
purchased it from. He has a very reputable restoration/repair shop. I
took it in so he could fix the fuel gauge as agreed, etc.

I asked him about possibly installing an oil temp gauge so I could
monitor, etc. He laughed &amp; told me I shouldn't bother, that it would only
&quot;scare me&quot; if I constantly monitored  the temp. I laughed at the time,
but as I was driving home the remark was sounding more &amp; more sexist &amp; I
got angry.

No, I don't know jack about fixing my westy (yet) but I have also never
failed to master a challenge. I guess the stereotypes about women &amp; car
engines is still going strong........

Anyway, I had to vent &amp; I will be doing more research in the archives
about the gauges before &quot;I&quot; install.

PS. Re: Karl, I, too am benefitting from his generosity! (he's sending me
a copy of his 75 westy manual.) The list is great!
