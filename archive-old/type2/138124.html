Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

Actually, that's not my assumption. From everything I have read, buses 
in Europe were not driven either as fast or as far as here. But the FI 
system was primarily for the US market, IIRC.

The subtler point is that buses had inherent limitations that were 
known and accepted when they were produced. We now drive them on 
highways where the attitude is that limitations are for losers. The 
temptation to push them to 70 mph and higher is strong, if only for 
reasons of safety!
