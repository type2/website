Listers,

when talking to people at Everybus I realized how hard it is for owners of European market buses to get the parts they need.
Just ask Bear about his right hand drive heater cables or his Vanagon 1600 exhaust parts ....
The place I got all my VW in Germany from is called Volksteile and has pretty much the same philosophy as Bus Depot: provide all the parts you need for your bus (new and used) at reasonable prices.
I am not sure how thrilled Cord is about me advertising his business and the thought of shipping parts overseas but I am sure that he would find a way to help you with parts you just cannot get over here.
Check out: http://www.volksteile_dot_de/ 
Their page is in German only, but they do speak some English. Their email 
is: teiledienst_at_volksteile_dot_de 
If you inquire about parts I would suggest to include the VW part number or the German part name to make sure that you are talking about the same part.
If you need any further help, feel free to get in touch with me (marcus_at_schaper_dot_com). I am happy to assist anyone who has trouble finding their part in Germany or needs assistance with payment arrangements (most German part dealers do not accept credit cards or personal checks).
Please bear in mind that the internet is not yet as widely used as over here. So you will not find a browsable catalog at the Volksteile site and they might take a while to respond to email. But they should be able to get you pretty much any part for your bus (up to '92) well below VW prices.

Cheers,
Marcus
