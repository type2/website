Subject: [T2] Restoration Prices

Hey everyone...
  I'm looking to do a total restoration on my 68 bus with updadted
interior/paint. I called the folks at West Coast Classic
(www.classicvws_dot_net) and thier ball park figure for ANY type 2 early or
late, is $15,000 to 20,000. Is this a lot of money for a resto?

  'Preciate your 411...

peace &amp; harmony

P.S. Happy New Year!
