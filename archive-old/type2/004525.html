Subject: 1970 Front end help????

    Ok, all of this talk about front ends could not have come at a better
time! Today, I tore down my trusty 1970 to check the front wheel bearings
since I have heard a little noise coming from my front passenger wheel.
Everything looks great! Bearings are perfect, shoes are perfect, nothing
rubbing or catching. I figure I will at least repack the bearings while I am
in there. But I have 2 questions:

1. Only while the brake is NOT on, and only at lower speeds, I can hear and
FEEL an almost thumping kind of sound coming from the front end. It appears
to be originating on the passenger side, but I can not be 100% sure...Any
ideas?

2. There is a rubber boot on something behind the backing plate ( ball
joint? ) that is torn open and full of crud. Is this bad and if so, can I
fix it myself?

Thanks everyone!
