Subject: Re:squeeky fan belt

Sam,
    You said....&quot;lately my fan belt has been squeeky when my bus at a
idle or when i start her up is there a certain spray or something i
can get to make the noise go away &quot;......

I also had what I thought was the classic belt squeak.  Replacing the
belt with a new one didn't make the squeak go away.  It turned out to
be an intake leak that sounded EXACTLY like a belt squeak.  So I'd say
adjust or replace the belt As Soon As Possible because the squeak may
be something more than you think.
