Subject: Anyone want a Dometic fridge?

I removed the 12V/120V dometic fridge components from Lief today and put in a drain 
so that I now have an icebox.

The fridge worked.  Or at least it worked as well as others have said that these 
things work.  On 120V it gets quite cold.  On 12V it gets a little cold and drains 
the battery (brand new gel cell deep cycle -- biggest one I could fit) in about 4 
hours or so.

I didn't want to throw it out, so if anyone in BC wants it, it's free for the 
taking.  You can use it to convert an icebox into a fridge although personally I 
prefer the icebox.

It would be a bit awkward to ship but if anyone is really excited about having one 
of these marvels of technology.....
