Hi,
	I think that some contributors may be missing the point. Michael
said _he_ wouldn't consider a trip in an under 3-4K bus he specifically
said that this could be considered a measure of risk: it's clear that 
peoples assessment will  be different, especially taking into account 
the implications of an unexpectedly extended trip a a result of a 
breakdown- this could mean anything from  financial disaster or a 
welcome opportunity to extend a trip and make some new friends 
depending on your situation...

 The other thing is that the fact that you paid $400 for a bus doesn't
mean it's a $400 bus. The volk on this list are going to be the ones
that pick up bargains and have the spares and expertise to build a 
reliable vehicle out of someone elses &quot;unreliable POS&quot;.
 If you've had a bus for six months, replaced worn out parts with
ones that would have cost hundreds of dollars to source professionally
and invested a couple of hundred hours in preventative maintenance
and basic renovation, you can't really describe it as a $400 bus: it's
a $3000 bus that you bought for $400!!!

Cheers,
	 W.
