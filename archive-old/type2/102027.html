Subject: Fwd: Re: siping

I asked a friend of mine to comment on siping.  He works at an engineering firm that specializes in accident investigations.  These guys have seen it all and have the best data available on accidents and their causes.  Here is his reply:

&gt;It's just a scam to upsell the customer - no real benefit. File that one
&gt;with cell phone signal enhancers, stick-on horsepower devices for your ECU
&gt;and magnetic pain-relieving bracelets.
&gt;
&gt;Have you seen the groves made by the siping machine? They are miniscule. I
&gt;can't see them shedding much water in the wet.

One more data point for bus owners considering spending $40 for siping.  My bus will not ever have this done unless new data surfaces that proves its worth.
