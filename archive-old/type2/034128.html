Subject: Re: Engine Paint

I hope Mick is happy that he is at least getting SOME answers to his
question this time.

I don't recall exactly what engine the on-line blurb I read was testing, but
seem to remember that the black paint ran 10 degrees (oil) cooler than the
other colors tested. Mick'll havta go look for the write-up.

If the color is NOT important on a particular engine, may I suggest a hot
pink, with alternating horizontal green, orange, and purple stripes. It
drives the girls crazzzy!

I've over allocated my 2-cents worth on this one.

&gt; However, the great majority of the heat transfer in a VW engine is via
&gt; forced convection, which is why we need that big fan and all those fins
&gt; on the engine.  Therefore, the whole &quot;What color to paint the engine&quot;
&gt; arguement might be moot.
