Subject: the dreaded hesitation

hi list - my 68 is on the road so i'm switching gears to get the 75 going.
a few weeks ago it began acting up. at 45mph it gave the dreaded
hesitation; one pull - that's it. a few trips later it happened one more
time. then a trip or two later it hesitated at 45mph once again. later in
the afternoon following the last single tug, the bus couldn't make it out
of my neighborhood. climbing a hill thwarted the attempt. i circled around
taking the flat route - no chance - i must have blown something out. its
been sitting since. it idles well, but under load of first gear it wants to
cut out. my first hunch and hopeful fix: years ago, a vw mechanic welded
the lower egr pipe at the egr's flange near to the exhaust elbow. it did
give a little more life to the egr filter. now that welded area is loose
and seems a replacement egr is likely. infrequently listmembers have
advertised having bought the wrong one they'd want to sell an egr filter.
any sellers, or who is the vender with the best egr deal known to listkind?
BIGthanks, - steve
