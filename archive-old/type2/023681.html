Hi all! i finally got my new Westy home over the weekend. I have two 
questions:

1.) Although i am very happy with my 71 westy, i would love for it to have 
the upper binks found on the late models (74 and later?) is there anyway to 
retro fit this, if i get one from a parts car? If so, what do I need to be 
sure to get to make it work (hardware, etc.)?

2.) The engine in it needs to be replaced, and I would ideally like to go toa 
larger 1700 engine. Does this &quot;bolt- in&quot;. Meaning, are there any retro-fit 
considerations, or tranny considerations?

Thanks!
