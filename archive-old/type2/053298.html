&gt; Apple Computer makes a beautiful 22 inch flat panel display that works VERY
&gt; well for watch wide screen DVDs. It costs as much as I plan to pay for my
&gt; bus.

And they won't sell it to you unless you buy a Power Macintosh G4, which is
the only computer that the special video card the Cinema Display needs will
work in. (For that kind of scratch I'd put dual 21&quot; Diamondtrons on it and
invest the remaining cash in something like Webers or beer.)

Bus content: The engine's downstairs and I got the top sheetmetal off. So
far so good. Yesterday I was sitting in it, fiddling with something, and
stepped on the clutch pedal. Very bad clutch feel...no kiddin, the clutch is
sitting downstairs still attached to the engine!

I pulled the CVs. No signs of wear that would suggest replacing the joints,
so I changed the boots, packed them with good Molybdenum Disulfide grease
and wrapped them in a bag.

The cabinet's out finally. That took a little while; we set the flea fogger
off in the basement before I'd retrieved my nutdriver with the right socket
on it. Don't do this.
