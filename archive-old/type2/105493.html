Subject: Re: [T2] windshield seal

Hiya Rob,

Just had this done in the past year to The Duck.  

The seals out of Wolfsburg West are  regular works of art.  As Dave mentions 
the &quot;American&quot; style seals (with groove for molding) are more expensive.  But 
if you want your bus to look OEM..........well, you gotta do what you gotta 
do.  By the way WW also has the chrome strips (brushed aluminum) for your 
window.  I'd definitely recommend their product.
