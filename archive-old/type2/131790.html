Subject: RE: [T2] pulley/spacer behind fan

How big is that spacer? I guess I need to find one since I pulled the pulley 
off. Anybody have a pic? I have a few other fulley assembled cranks up to 
the hub, but I don't remember seeing any spacers.

Thanks,

&gt;BTW, if you ever take the fan off a type IV motor and re-assemble it 
&gt;without
&gt;using either the pulley or the spacer you'll start chewing up fan belts
&gt;right and left.
