Subject: gaskets?

Hello to all on this Saturday....
I am looking for the oil filler neck gasket for a 1800cc type 4
engine. I am unable to find one without buting a whole gasket
set and I do not have that kind of dough right now......
So if anyone has an extra they would like to sell or can
get one, please let me know..
