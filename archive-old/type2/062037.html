Subject: radar (kinda non-vw)

But most radar detectors (especially older X/K band models) give off weak
radar signals in normal operation, so broadcasting low-level radar signals
must be OK or there'd be all sorts of cops confiscating them as &quot;illegal
transmitters&quot;.  Hmmm...I wonder if you could modify an otherwise useless
X/K detector to spit out a bit more signal than they used to.  I'd just
mount the thing in the back of my bus and rig it to stay on all the time.
(Or come on with the brake lights...)
