Subject: Re: [T2] VW Emblem???

a friend of mine in canada has a chrome emblem for his splitty and for a few years 
has attached it this way
so that when he parks it in a potential theft area he can take it off. works great 
and if you wrap the magnets or coat them they shouldn't scratch the paint.  not sure 
of what magnets he uses but they were about and inch and a half square ish and he used 3.

&gt; 
&gt; Here's an idea.  Untried, but I'll wager that it will work:
&gt; 
&gt; Get a half-dozen neodymium magnets:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.wondermagnet_dot_com/dev/magnet32.html
&gt; 
&gt; Glue them to the back of the emblem with epoxy or somesuch.
&gt; 
&gt; You now have an emblem that you can simply stick on when you want it.
&gt; Each magnet can hold 10 pounds of force, so if you use six the emblem will
&gt; stay put!
