Subject: locking gas cap

 My 70' came from the p.o. with an aftermarket locking cap.=20
It used a collar that clamped around the filler neck with a set screw.
I took it off cuz I didn't really feel the need for it, and I didn't =
want to
loose the one and only key.
Also, as I recall that collar might have had a tendency to want to spin
while opening.

Jako   =20
