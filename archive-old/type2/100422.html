Subject: Leak down test

If my compression was 125-135 in all four cylinders on a 1600 dual port 
engine, what value/information would a leak down test provide.

A SWAG, how many hours would it take for a competent mechanic (as defined by 
Clymers) to perform the leak down test??

Thanks

Barry B sends
