Yes, that's true.  My mom has been in the hospital and nursing home  recently and I don't know how many times I was asked if she was alergic  to latex.  But it's probably like peanut allergies.  Very few people.   Still ticks me off that I can't get peanuts on an airplane.  Maybe they  should have a special non-peanut section.  
    
    If anyone wants to ride in the Bopmobile, you can smoke, eat peanuts or  do anything you want with latex.  Clothing optional.  Except for you,  Karl.  Cheers...KR
  
  
but be aware many people are sensitive to Latex, and some are very alergic
to latex and have even died just from touching something that has been
handled by someone wearing latex gloves.  it appears that the latex alergy
is brought on by extensive contact with latex.  I highly reccomend some   of
the latex alternatives used by many hospitals and docs nowdays. the cost
is about the same but without the latex sensitivity problem.  IF you are
using latex gloves and you find your hands itching or getting red STOP
immediately and use something different.  Vynl or Nitrile work just as
well or better
