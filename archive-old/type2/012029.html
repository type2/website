Rich,

I have the same problem on my 77 Automatic westy.  I
beleive this falls into the category of old wiring, as
i ended up replacing the old wiring to the battery and
new cables plus the i installed the Starter Relay Kit
from the bus depot.

this solved the problem for me !

&gt; Here's the problem, when going to turn it on
&gt; again, the engine turns
&gt; over very slowly...seems as if the the starter is
&gt; under powered...tried to
&gt; jump start it and the extra juice didn't make any
&gt; change...turned the engine
&gt; over by hand, no problem seems to turn over
&gt; smoothely....so...my question
&gt; is,
&gt;
