The PO replaced the pop top seal last fall but did not do the seal on the
front part (luggage rack).  How is this piece removed?  Also,  what is the
best type of cleaner to use on the fiberglass.

    You can buy this seal new for $25 or so. Get ahold of the old one at a
corner or joint and start pulling--it'll just strip right off.  If you cant
get ahold of it or none of it is loose, then you probably dont need a new
one yet.  Also, if yours is original, the new one you get will look
different than the original--call any supplier you want but nobody has an
original looking one. On the upside, the newer ones seal great. Follow
instructions for installation.
    To clean the fiberglass, use some type of bathtub mildew cleaner. I used
X14 but there are many others. To restore the fiberglass properly, there is
a good article on the type2_dot_com site. Good luck!
