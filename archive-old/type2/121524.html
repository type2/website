Subject: RE: [T2] Adjusting flaps/thermostat when in a warm climate?

&gt;The List WRT just any old kind of thermostat used on an air-twirler (VW,
&gt;Porsche, or Corvair), so you &quot;might&quot; be comparing apples to jellyfish
&gt;here dragging in the Corvair, and THAT might give the new guy some wrong
&gt;idears.

The design is very similar if not the same. In fact the Corvair guys are 
using VW thermostats in place of the OEM Corvair part since nobody is 
reproducing them...

Brass bellows with alcohol in them. I suspect they are made with a spring 
function where in a relaxed mode, they are contracted and when expanded due 
to the hot alcohol inside they are pushed out like a spring waiting to 
collapse again.

When the spring-y-ness (technical term here) is gone, or when they have 
developed a leak, they expand. What limits the expansion of a bad 
thermostat? Unfortunately I am the owner of 1 good VW Type thermostat and 1 
good Corvair thermostat (need two) or I'd explore that question...

Would they (I don't know) expand with a small hole drilled in them to allow 
the atmosphere in? I plan to disassemble one of my Corvair thermostats just 
to see what is inside.

Wonder if we could refill, clamp, and resolder old thermostats? Wonder how 
they were/are manufactured?
