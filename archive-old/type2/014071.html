Subject: Re: [T2] strange clutch change



&gt; 
&gt; I replaced my clutch cable about two months ago when I began having 
&gt; difficulty shifting. 
&gt; 
&gt; All of a sudden today the exact same problem returned. I have about 4 inches 
&gt; of freeplay in the peddle before I feel any resistance as I push it down and 
&gt; it is not fully disengaging the flywheel. 
&gt; 
&gt; Did the cable suddenly stretch or is there another problem?

I'm willing to bet that your cable has broken in all but a couple of strands.  Replacement time!
