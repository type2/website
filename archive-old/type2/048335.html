Subject: [T2] 69 Westy wiring

Hey everybody,
    So, I finally get a day off to get into my new westy, and i try to
decide if I can fix my brake lights.  After checking the archives, I realize
my problem is probably the pressure switch, but decide to tackle the wiring
since it looks pretty haggard.  I happen to have a 68 donor bus so I strip
out the wiring harness from front to rear and replace it( about 4 hours of
work) and finally got my hazzards to work.

      Well, here i am with no brake lights and no turn signals, so I guess I
need to try the pressure switch, right????


    Here's the question, can I trade out the old fuse box with a newer style
one, and is this a difficult procedure?

       Thanks again for all the help,

                Hope to see you all again soon,    Jon
