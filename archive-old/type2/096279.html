Nahhhhhhh,  got both color and B/W versions and for 78 it is 3 fold out
pages plus a number of suplements.   and they are all in that &quot;Flow
chart&quot; design.


I want one like the &quot;before&quot; 73 model diagrams that show everything on one
diagram and it is laid out logically.   

&gt; &gt;you found these wiring diagrams for the 78????  I have seen em for earlier
&gt; &gt;busses but for the later ones all I have found is that stupid flow chart
&gt; &gt;like wiring diagram.

one of these days if I can find 2 or 3 spare minutes I may draw one up but
it would probably need a lot of double checking before I would depend on
it.   I did one like that for my gas heater and it saves many headaches
