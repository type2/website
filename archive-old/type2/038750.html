Subject: Re: I have two screws loose!

&gt; 
&gt; Itch has a '71 DP doghouse motor.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that the screws holding the coil on were loose - way loose.
&gt; Attempts to tighten the screws produce no results.
&gt; 
&gt; What's on the other side of the tin to hold the screws? I'm thinking just to
&gt; go oversize on the screws.
&gt; 
The nuts are mounted into the shroud and have broken
loose. probably fixed best with a bit of creative welding.
