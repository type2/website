Well, today's nomination for the most dreadful installation item goes to
the Berg Breather assembly.  I invested the way-too-much-money in this in
the hope that the oil problem I'm having with my 1776 would be eased if I
collected and returned the oil to the case.

The design of the Berg is clever but no tool in my collection would reach
the two allen head screws that are the final installation items.  I ended
up using one of those ball end wrenches which allowed me to make maybe 1/8
turn before it bashed up against the fan housing or the generator pedestal.
All this with the engine on a stand in the garage and therefore at waist
level. If I ever have to do that with the engine in the bus, I may just
punt and return to the stock filler tube.

Not a fun way to spend one of the precious hours we get to work on buses.
