Subject: Re: [Re: [T2] Clicking Sound]

I just replaced an axle on my 70. I needed an 8mm triple D bit. (It may also
be called splined) It is like an allen wrench but has 12 points. Looks like
an asterik *. I found a set for $15 at Carquest.
It was really simple to remove. I did mine with the wheels on the ground,
but I would suggest having the wheel off the ground slightly to rotate the
tire because some of the bolts are hard to get at the right angle.
Good Luck,
Jim
