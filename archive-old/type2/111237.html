Subject: Bus Depot prices to HIGH ! I Found parts way cheaper here &gt;&gt;&gt;  

not to knock anyone or ones company but competition is
the name of the game. as a very small business owner
myself I understand prices sell..and so does
Word-To-Mouth..

so im spreading the word..

I've heard so much hype about bus depot, then i
followed several posts by some folks on the list, so
before ordering from bd i did some homework..

I found there prices next to insane, compared to what
i found at Pacific J Bugs Ph. 1-800-231-1784

I ordered a catalog from them about 6 months ago for
my notchback, now that i have a bus i skimmed through
what i needed, then i took that part# and checked on
bus depots site, and not only were their prices simply
insane, they also didnt have a lot of what i needed,
(or at least it didnt show on my shopping cart).

pacific j bugs has a lifetime warranty on all rubber
they sell, regardless of misuse/ handling over the
years..

i will grant bus depot had a much lower price on their
turn signal lenses, PJB $49 BD $24, but that was the
only item they could beat, everything else from rubber
to hubcaps, pacific smoked them..

I ordered front seal, 4 hub caps, horn, gas door stop,
engine rubber, and their shipping was only $8.00 hows
that for s/h.. (doesnt seem to inflated considering 4
hub caps)

Im not a salesman for pacific bugs, im just passing on
the info to help us less fortunate low budget
types..or on the other hand are we more fortunate??

peace,
