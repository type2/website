List,
Okay, i know i'm asking for it, but i've already stripped all the FI stuff off my 75 2.0L and installed a single weber and a 009 dist - i'm working on the icing problem, but i need to know how the auto trans knows when to shift -is it vacuum? is it the throttle linkage? is it both? There have to be some less-than-purists out there who have jerry-rigged these things and know the diress i'm bringing on myself and how to move forward from here rather than backtracking and reconditioning the FI.  Help me! I'm stupid!
