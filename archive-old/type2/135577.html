I actually pulled in an award! 3rd place in the Bay Window category!!!
Of course, there were only 5 bays there, but the 2 that didn't win
anything were both trucks and way better than mine. Go figure. heh

Anyway, great carabus from Irvine to Oceanside, good times, about 60
vehicles of all types showed. I'm stoked by this trip and can't wait
for my next one!!
