Subject: looks stupendous

I'm shocked and disappointed at all the neglected vans running around.  It seems
so many van owners have never heard of soap and water, or wax either.  I like to
wax mine at least twice a year ( I use &quot;Rain Dance&quot;).  I used one van for ten
years as a painters truck and still managed to keep it clean and shiney.  The
wax makes it possible to get the occasional paint spatter off.  My own
philosophy is that If you make your van look good, you'll naturally be inclined
to keep it in good mechanical condition.  Cleaning and waxing is a good front
line defense against rust and road salt, etc.   It does seem that all those
water cooled people wash and wax their vans..Maybe there's something about a car
note that makes folks get out the soap and water...
