Subject: Stock fuel and vacuum hose

If you guys are really having a problem finding the stock hoses, I have all
the brainded and smooth German hose for vacuum, fuel (carb or FI, early or
late type) and diesel rated for about any metric application you can name.
Prices range from $3.95 to $12.95 per meter in i.d. sizes from 1.9 to 12mm. 

Really, any VW/Audi/BMW/Mercedes dealer or independant shop that has a good
rep with Euro cars should have this in stock or certainly can get it, it
simply is not scarce at all. I buy it in 20m coils from fresh stock year
after year.
