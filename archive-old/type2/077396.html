A bad year for seats? Eh?  They're the same as any other bus, 68-mid75.
Passenger and drivers seats are different, so they wont swap left to
right. but any year in that range will go in.  They're all the same.  You
may find some that have the headrest inserts, and headrests. They were
options through the years. Still just a basic flat lowback seat.
(nonwalkthough busses are a bit different, so be warned.)

Now, 72 DOES have a few one year only quirks..bumpers, only type4 engined
bus without an over-engine hatch, an odd jog in the shiftrod just fore of
the transmission nosecone..

You may or may not have success, I dont recall, putting a later bay or
vanagon seat into the drivers seat tracks(some people consider this a more
comfortable seat). I've heard of it being done...but I wont vouch for it.
Will NOT go on the passenger side though.

anyway.
