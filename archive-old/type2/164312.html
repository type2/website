Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for fuel injection help (L-Jet)

Yeah there is a remote attached, that would be a PITA.

Sorry if I'm asking questions you've allready answered in previous posts.
You're close, it's one simple thing which I'm sure you'll find soon.  Whenever
I get stumped, it's either right in front of me, or somthing I thought I'd
checked allready.

Thats what Im thinking, my brain is getting mushy, its been a long time since
I started messing with this..

Thanks again everybody..
Aaron

  First, I hope you have a hotwire remote start rig set up so you're not
trying to run back and forth between the cab and the engine.

  I did the troubleshooting on the double relay by the Bartnik guide and found
I forgot the black wire from the coil.  If you're not VERY familiar with it I
would start there, it's in the Type2_dot_com library.  I believe you have verified
the black wire connection, but have you tested continuity to the double
relay?

  Also, have you checked the resistor?  Are the ground wires getting a good
ground at the mounting screw?  I think you also verified fuel pressure?  If
not, have you tried hotwiring the pump incase somthing is not triggering it to
come on?  Do you have a spare injector plug?  Maybe hotwire that, making sure
you use the resistor.  I've done this with a lawn mower battery and the
resistor pack to check spray pattern.  It would be doubtful that you would get
four bad injectors so, I would start by making sure the fuel pump is coming
on.  Then I would work from the injectors outwards, first on the power side,
then on the ground side to see if they are getting power and grounding.  If
they fire they make a faint but audible click that you might be able to hear
if you get a long screwdriver, put the pointy end on the injector and the
other end to your ear if you don't want to pull them.   It would be easier to
just pull one, but be advised they put out a pretty healthy spray.
