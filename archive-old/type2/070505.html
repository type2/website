Subject: Re: stickers/cops (longish)

Reminds me of my friend who recently sold his 76 Westy, he's been out of 
school for a few years, but back in high school they sent the dogs around 
the parking lot. He had been doing restoration work on his bus, custom. 
The police tore his bus apart and found some beer I think, I got the 
story second hand, but you get the point. It's sad.

By the way I'm on a personal vendeta to restore the friendliness of VW 
drivers to that of the 50s and 60s, when VW drivers were rare like now, 
the air cooled vws at least. Me and a fellow VW I have never met happened 
to wave at each other at the same moment we passed on the road, since we 
both drove busses. I honked at a Bug and waved, he was shocked at first 
but then he smiled. I'll do it all the time, so if you see a guy with a 
beard and long hair in a 69 westy, chocolate brown, and a sticker with 
hendrix in front, it just might be me.
