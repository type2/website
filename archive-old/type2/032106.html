&gt; ...If you add it at the gauge end, it shouldn't change the readings

&gt; Now for my question:
&gt; How long does it take to start getting a reading on the temp gauge?
&gt; Is this true about adding extra wire length?

The needle on my gauge starts climbing within 1 minute of starting up.
It's usually up to a stable operating temp of about 350 degrees F within
5-6 minutes?

I'll leave response about the extra wire length affecting gauge
accuracy to our more electronics-savvy bus comrades.
