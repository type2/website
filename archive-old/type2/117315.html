Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchangers/J-bars

&gt; Hello. I have a question about heat exchangers. Since I live in the
&gt; South West, I don't have much of a need for heat except for maybe two
&gt; months of the year. I removed the heat exchangers and removed the rusted
&gt; sheet metal to reveal the J-bars. Instead of finding standard J-bars
&gt; like the aftermarket parts I see, I found louvered heat dispersers on
&gt; the pipe. (I can post a picture if it will help my description) Will

these are heat sinks to help even the bus heat out and more mass for the
heat.

&gt; this create any heating problems for the engine? Should I use regular
&gt; aftermarket J-bars or is there nothing to worry about? Any information
&gt; would be appreciated. Thanks Dave.

either or, although there are no aftermarket J-tubes for the type IV
engine to my knowledge...I removed the heatsinks from my J-tubes to make
em lighter, but it is a lot of work to do this.
 I have never noticed any effect on the cooling of the bus itself with or
without the heatbox or the heat sinks vs the bar tube.,,I've run em all
three ways
