&gt; GREAT. So what did they do to my baby??? I saw the vehicle do a
&gt; clockwise shift on the hoist. What happened?

take a small empty box, open both ends, take an open end in each hand,
twist one hand clockwise the other counter clockwise......you get the
idea.   it can be fixed but don't let em tell you it's worth $200 and try
to buy you off, oh and the blue book is not accurate for older vehicles,
check the &quot;Green&quot; book for accurate value on older vehicles,  I found a
copy at my library when I needed one.

sorry for the turkeys that have broken your bus, make em fix it right.
