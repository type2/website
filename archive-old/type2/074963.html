Subject: Re: [T2] CAD files in the archive idea

The files I am going to put on my site will always be there. If anyone wants
to add them to the type2 library feel free. They are for the community.

Right now I am working on making each individual detail in 3 forms.

1) In full size for anyone who can plot them fullsize, which would be more
rare than not.

2) Each detail on a 24 X 36 sheet at 2&quot; = 1'-0 scale that most people with
Autocad experience or access to a printer type firm in their town can plot
them out.
This would also mean that most of the panels for a Westy would fit on about
3 sheets. This is what I am doing now. I am also trying to make sure that
this scale would allow me to plot out the drawing and scan each individual
detail on my scanner. That means that each panel can be read by anyone with
internet access. It would be a .jpeg or .bmp file.

3) Blowing up each of these panels to fit a 24 x 36 sheet. This is what I
would ship to people who have no access of a file reader of any sort (or
someone who just wants big full size drawings).

Once again I have no problem with anybody making copies or passing them out
or putting them on the library.

I am not the only one doing these drawings, but I feel sure they agree.

I am going to post the first detail in .dwg form of the rear panel in a few
minutes. The measurements were taken by Russell and I added the dimensions,
etc.

&gt;
&gt; --Rob says his site will offer .dwg and .plt files IIRC, and there is
strong support of .pdf files also.
&gt;
&gt; Why not offer the pdf. file from the same place, which will be democratic,
and require some admin. volunteer time. I run autocad, but I don't know how
to convert to .pdf.
&gt;
&gt; and/or: post the link to the &quot;volo view&quot; download so folks can see the
.dwg's if they want to go that way. Most of us who will be drawing will be
using the .dwg format I would guess.
&gt;
&gt; can we get this whole affair on type2_dot_com?
&gt;
&gt; We'll need standardized title blocks with pertinent info so these drawings
don't become useless if revised later.
