Subject: Shift in Westy

I had the opportunity to drive a friend's 84 Westfalia about 100 miles on
Friday.  Was (sadly) amazed at how quiet and powerful that baby was.  Are
those water-cooled?

Anyway, the shifter had two problems.  It was awfully stiff, even after
warming up thoroughly.  Also, it didn't want to come out of (any) gear until
the rpm had dropped quite a bit, after pushing in on the clutch.  Went
*into* each gear just fine.  Are these typical of the Westy, or does my
friend have a problem just waiting to happen?

P'rfesser
72 bus.  Not quiet.  Not powerful. :-(
