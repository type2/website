Subject: Re: [T2] Choke Help

I just got my choke element in, and now I need help putting this on.  How
&gt;do I install this little thing?

What you do is ball it up in the palm of your hand, rare back and heave it
as far as possible.  I have an electric on mine, but I sure miss the manual
on my old '60 bug.
