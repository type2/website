Subject: RE: [T2] Crankcase ventilation

&gt;From: Gregory Urban &lt;urban_at_yaic_dot_com&gt;

&gt;The tube also heads downwards, and ends just above the lower tin.  I'd take 
&gt;a picture but the warm air duct that runs to the air cleaner is in the way. 
&gt;  Anyway, this tube drips oil onto the tin, which naturally creates some 
&gt;knarly smoke.  Is this tube supposed to be connected back to the block 
&gt;somewhere?  I don't see any extra parts from the engine pull/installation, 
&gt;but I haven't looked to hard yet.


If it is what I am thinking of then no it does not connect back to the 
block. It does however have a sortof cap on it with a slit cut into it. Look 
at part F in the diagram below.
