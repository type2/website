&gt; What's the baseline setting (turns in/out)

I haven't seen any info on that in the Bentley so I assume half way to give
you the maximum flexibility to raise or lower it.

&gt; which way leans/enriches
&gt; for smogtest specifically

The screw is essentially a controlled vacuum leak but what's different is
that this is air has been metered by the AFM and is simply bypassing the
throttle plate. See this diagram:

Counterclockwise raises the RPM which I always get backwards the first time.

In the idle smog test they rev up the bus to about 2500rpm for a 30-60
seconds (I can't remember) then drop to idle and watch the %CO level rise.
They watch the numbers and if it gets close to the limit for your vehicle
they keep watching to see if it exceeds it.

I don't have a CA GE engine like you so I don't know what your limit will
be. My engine is rated for 1% +/- .5% CO (Federal GE engine) and the limit
was 2.5%.  Unless you are overly rich to begin with, you should pass that
test.

If you fail you can retest but the fail still goes into the DMV computer
system as an event. I would pre-test to make sure that the %CO levels are
well within passing levels because you've never smogged before. The smog
test equipment doesn't get calibrated every day...
