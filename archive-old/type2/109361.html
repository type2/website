Subject: Re: [T2] what years are diesel engines available

Don't forget that most diesels run at much lower RPM and develop peak torque
and HP much lower than petrol engines.
Just make sure the motor you select is suitable for the trans in the bus you
have.
I would love to one day fit a Deutz air cooled diesel motor in a Bay Kombi,
but not sure it will ever happen :-)
