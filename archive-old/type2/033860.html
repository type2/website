Subject: Re: whirring sound in D.C.

Hi Paul,

&gt; I have 79' and when I turn the wheels to right, I get a whirring sound from the
&gt; front passenger wheel.

I have no idea if my experience will help but who knows. On my 1978
Kombi I had the problem that when I turned to the right (like on your
bus) I heard a scratching sounds. I always thought it had something to
do with the front wheels. I check the brake calipers, the wheelbearings.
I even replaced the wheel bearings and the brake disc but nothing
worked. Until I suddenly discovered that when I pulled the handbrake a
little the noise stopped. I turned out that the handbrake cable was not
tight enough and scratched the brake drum of the right-rear wheel.

I was always looking for the problem in the front wheels but somehow the
cable transported the sound from the rear to the back. I replaced the
brake 'back plate' (it was totally gone by corrosion) and now the noise
is gone.

So if it is the cable scratching the brake drum in the rear I guess the
sound must disapear when you pull the handbrake a little.

PS: If you want to know if the brake calipers have been replaced, just
look at them and see if they are not all covered with rust. If they are
coated in a beautiful shining paint they're probably new.
