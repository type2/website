Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Paint Color

When my '79 get to the painting stage it's going to
be Hooters orange (with owl) and a white top.  My
original thought was brown, primer grey front mixed
with spots of rattle can orange on it, and a cigar
band by the back wheels.  If it starts to blow smoke
people will think it's a special effect! 

Unfortunately my wife axed the latter and not thrilled
with the first.

All I know is it will be different.
