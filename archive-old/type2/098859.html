Lucky folks with '71 and up buses don't need the cotter pins as they have
composite drums.  There is a handy divot in the hub that allows a socket
wrench to have a straight shot at the cylinder bolt.

&gt; This would also be a good opportunity to clean, inspect, and re-grease your
&gt; wheel bearings and CV joints (be sure to have new CV boots handy, in case
&gt; one/some are ripped, or get ripped while you work on the joints).  Me, I'd just
&gt; replace 'em all--it's a lot of work to *just* replace a torn CV boot, later on.
&gt; .....AND BUY GERMAN ONES.

Having done &quot;precautionary&quot; CV boot replacements with German Lobro brand
boots and then having them tear a few months later, I have concluded that
if the boots aren't cracked or leaking it is better to leave them alone.
I carry replacements and the tools to change them with on trips, just in
case.
