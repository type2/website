I have a quesion I recently bought a 71' Campmobile. The guy I bought it from had gave me tons of the parts that came out of a 76' Camp along with many other parts that came with it was a Colman Furnace for use with LP Gas. Model #4312 Code # 729 Serial # 067704090 Input BTU/HR 12,000 Output BTU/HR 9,000. It is a Direct wall Furnace and has a designed maxium outlet air temp of 200F
