I paid $5000 for my 82 westy with 110K miles.  I thought I was getting a
deal.  I still think I did until you hear stories like this.

&gt; Well, since you brought it up....went camping this past weekend at the KOA
in
&gt; Front Royal. When I found my assigned spot, couldn't believe it, but right
&gt; across from me was an '89 Westy. No one was around, but a couple hours
later
&gt; the owners showed up. They just bought it a few months ago. It was in
&gt; showroom condition. The owner said the plastic shrink wrap was still on
the
&gt; stove! The purchase price: $4,900.00!!! The one thing I found interesting:
&gt; neither buyer nor seller is on the Internet. I asked they couple if they
were
&gt; aware of Vanagon_dot_com and they said they had heard of it, but really
weren't
&gt; into the Internet (retired folks, early 60's). My feeling is the Internet
is
&gt; helping to push prices up. You can still get one for a decent price, but
not
&gt; from someone on the net!    Jeff S.
