&gt;replacing the Westfalia canvas.  They mentioned using &quot;X-14,&quot;
&gt;which does contain bleach.  I've seen it in grocery stores--it's for
&gt;cleaning your bathroom.  I'd consider wearing gloves, and keeping
&gt;the stuff out of your mouth/eyes though.

&gt;In fact, I'll be using some on MY pop-top in the next couple of weeks.


I've been hesitant to use X-14 because of the fine print on the label. It=
 says DO NOT USE ON PAINTED SURFACES. I'm afraid of what the run off will=
 do to the paint on  my Vanangon.
