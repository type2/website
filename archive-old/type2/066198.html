Subject: Re: Bubble Camper Int. in a Splittie?

Jon:

&gt; Has anyone retrofitted a Bubble Window Camper interior (68-79, but I
&gt; have a 71 from James Brill) into an early or late Splittie Bus, or know
&gt; of someone who has?  I'm not concerned about the pop-top stuff, just bed,
&gt; table, rear facing seat etc.  I have either a 66 (wide rear hatch) or a 63
&gt; (narrow rear hatch) splittie bus that could use a decent Camper interior.
 
I have a bubble window bed, table and rear-facing seat installed in 
my '65 deluxe.  The table and rear-facing seat are fairly trivial to 
install. (I have a walk-through which was modified from the bench 
seat arrangement by the PPO.)

The fold down bed fits in as well but does not contour perfectly with 
the lower front facing plate abutting to the walls.  The bed's a tich 
smaller.  I also didn't secure the mounting points through the wheel 
well arch.  I just hated to drill holes in the pristine metal there.  
I've been living out of mine for about a month now waiting for my new 
home to be finished.  Very comfortablly too....

 
&gt; I know the rear cusion is longer and the top of the engine compartment may
&gt; have a heighth variance.  Just curious to get some feedback on this. 8-)
