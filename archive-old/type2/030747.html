I'm so proud that I managed to wait until Friday to  send this to the
whole list. I had to send it to SOMEONE the day it happened, but it's more
of a Friday-type story than an actual technical quesstion. 


Although I could probably use some input on why there was so much gas on
the ground.... I'm figuring that it was flooding because I was pumping so
much, because of the vacuum leak. But there seemed to be an awful lot of
gas on the ground, and I'm not quite sure why it would do that. It doesn't
seem to be a fuel line thing, it isn't leaking now that it's just sitting
on the rv pad. I think. I''ll look again when I get home.

So I got Skutter from where sie's been parked the last two months, to take
hir to our new home. We were running late, so instead of taking hir home,
I ended up taking hir to work. Of course, sie wouldn't start in the
morning... &lt;sigh&gt; When I got out and went around back to look, there was
gas and oil all over the ground under hir... 

I think the oil was just off the undercarriage, from the gas dripping
down. The gas, well, I don't know where that's coming from. Looks like
maybe the bottom of the carb? 

At this point, with everything else wrong in my life, it was just TOO
much. I poked around a little, then gave up and called my friend for a
tow. As we're driving down the highway, every time we stop I can see the
tow rope fraying a little more from being cut by his bumper, and I can
feel it abrading against my bumper as well. I don't have a horn, I can't
get his attention, people behind me are honking at me, and going 35 (in a
45 zone) two feet behind your friend's shiny little truck, is STRESSFUL!

I'm thinking all the way &quot;We're not going to make it, I'm gonna be broke
down on TV Highway, they're gonna tow my bus baby away and I'll never see
hir again... We made the turn off the highway, we made the turn off our
street, and just as we get right in front of the house... the tow rope
finally breaks, and I coast to a stop in front of the driveway. &lt;grin&gt;

We unhooked the pieces of the rope, pushed hir up onto the RV pad, and
this weekend, I begin the process of taking hir apart to rebuild. Hurray!
