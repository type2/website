Subject: Re: [T2] Running problems with a 78 fuel injection Bus

To me it sounds like the cylinder head temp sensor.  Once it dies after
starting to warm up simply connect a wire from the sensor connector
to ground, this will simulate a warm head signal, and try starting it up
again.  If it works, go get a new cylinder head temp sensor.  It's about
the only thing that changes as the engine warms up - the signal from the
temp sensor in the air flow meter should not change as the engine
warms up.

Good luck

&gt; It's probably the cylinder head temperature sensor.  It is located on the
&gt; drivers side head (#3 cylinder) and has a white wire that runs to it from
&gt; the main fuel injection wiring harness.  Wire may be loose, but if the bus
&gt; runs fine until it warms up the sensor is probably bad and needs replaced.
&gt; Fairly common preventive maintenance part.  It screws in and out much like
a
&gt; small spark plug with a wire attached to the top of it. About $15 at the
&gt; local import parts store or online retailer.  If this doesn't work the air
&gt; flow meter also has a temp sensor built into it.  Try the cylinder head
temp
&gt; sensor and let the list know if that fixes it.  Good luck.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I recently picked up a fuel injected 78 Bus.  I picked it up fairly
cheap,
&gt;&gt; the previous owner said he had problems keeping it running.  I got it
&gt;&gt; running pretty good for a day or two (just driving it around the
&gt;&gt; neighborhood) but now it is doing what the PO had said.  It'll start up
but
&gt;&gt; when it starts to warm up it doesn't want to run.  I've played with the
&gt;&gt; timing and checked all the vacuum hoses but that hasn't helped, any
ideas?
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
