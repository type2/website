&gt; I just looked-up the accounting of my T2 ownership.  I
 have owned my bus for 53 months.  During that time,
 besides gasoline and my or my son's labor time, some
 $6,534 has been spent on bus-related invoices.  I
 purchased the bus for $1,000, making the total direct
 expenditures $7,534.  We have had the engine out of
 the vehicle 5 times.  And for the money spent, I still
 have an unpainted, rag-tag T2 Riviera Plan 1 on my
 hands which is far from dependable.  It has been towed
 3-times while out-and-about, and has failed to start
 countless times.... But the
 first 4 years of Bus ownership were a nightmare.  I
 even changed mechanics a couple of times before
 discovering the simple magic of the patched aux
 battery rust-out.

What's missing in your balance sheet is the fact that these vehicles
were designed in an era when people were expected to repair their
vehicles at home, so that the possibility of you spending much less on
repairs is a reality for you as a T2 owner. Plus as the vehicles age,
there are fewer mechanics educated in T2, and many who were are
outdated in their knowledge as they do not keep up on the changing
thinking. How much would you have saved had the first mechanic seen
the battery box needed to be sealed to preserve your motors? I
purchased my bus for $200 and a turnkey motor from the wrecking yard
for $250. I since spent trivial amounts of money for little things
like $40 for a fuel pump and $12 for brake pads. The biggest other
investment was tires. I must confess, like Mark, that my bus is also
down, but again, it is my own fault as I did not know there was a
compatibility issue with my transmission which formerly had a type 1
motor conversion done by the PO.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you T2 list members for your understanding and
&gt; support.  Membership here in T2 is an ongoing growth
&gt; process for me.

As it has been for all of us.
