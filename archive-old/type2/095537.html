Subject: vacuum booster check vavle ?

 
I don't know if the term 'vacuum' really means any difference between sucking and blowing. Did I say that? A check valve of any type is to keep air/water/ketchup flowing in one direction and not the other. AT ALL! It seems you should be able to blow/suck to your heart's content one way, and not the other.

Billy

&gt;they are vacuum valves, try sucking on the valve rather than blowing
