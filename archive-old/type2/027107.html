if only it was just a dream...

hi there!
my name is karen and i have a '71 westie and this is my story:

had new generator and voltage regulator installed memorial weekend
(new bosch parts).

as i was leaving to go frolic in the desert over 4 of july, the red 
generator light came on.

so i switched cars and left my precious beast to chill over the weekend.

now i am working on it.

when i polarize the generator, the red light goes off.

when i shut off the car and start it again, the generator light comes back 
on.

again -polarize the generator and the red generator light goes off.

i've checked all juices with a volt meter and, they all seem to be flowing 
properly after polarization is complete.

i should mention that i have 2 batteries in her, one &quot;normal&quot; and one deep 
cylce marine battery with a relay.

why me?

oh knowledgeable listizens, please help!
i really wanna take her camping in two weeks.
she really deserves it, she's been such a good girl!

thanks!
