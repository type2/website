Subject: Re: [T2] 30 mm Berg oil pump in a type IV?

&gt; Hi All:
&gt; 
&gt; My Fast German rebuild type IV 2.0L (with 500 miles) suffers from low
&gt; oil pressure at idle (&gt;10 psi) when the oil temps get around 200F. I
&gt; have a choice of trying to return the engine (at my expense) or
&gt; upgrading the oil pump. Has anyone any experience with running a Berg
&gt; anodized 30 mm, O-ringed aluminum type I pump or other 30 mm pump? I
&gt; think my low pressure problems are due to the poor fit between the case
&gt; and the pump. I am hoping that the O-ring will reduce the amount of lost
&gt; oil when the engine is above 180F.
You might want to look into this a little more.  The oil pressure loss could
be indicative of a greater problem.  I had rebuilt a 1700 on my own and
didn't replace the bearings because of the mileage on the short block &amp;
because my prior engine experience with American cars usually lets you reuse
bearings if they mic out OK.  After lengthy discussions with elderly German
VW mechanics their take on the whole thing is it is the mains that create
the oil pressure.  If I am off on this please chime in.  Anyway expense wise
it might be beneficial to ship it back instead of replacing the oil pump.
