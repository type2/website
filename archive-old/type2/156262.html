  After the recent Every &quot;wet&quot; Bus event ( not complaining cause I
loved it ), I've decided to get rid of the tent and get a sleepable
trailer.

So, Im trying to find the max tow and tongue weight that I can haul
with my 78 Bay. Some specs on the bus:

1978 7 pass transporter (not westy)
2&quot; receiver
2 liter EFI with 4500 miles
mostly stock

Im looking at the obvious Scamp, Casitas and Burros but I'd like
something with a toilet and some kind of shower. It doesnt have to
be big cause its just for me and my daughter and we cook and &quot;live&quot;
in the screen room anyway.

Thanks in advance,

Dave.
