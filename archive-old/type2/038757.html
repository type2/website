&gt;I have 1974 bus with 1978 2 liter engine equipped with 2 barrel Weber carb.  
&gt;The following numbers are stamped into carb base: 32.36 DFAV 23A M5.  I am 
&gt;loking for a manual or instructions on how to properly adjust the carb.  Can 
&gt;anyone advise on where I can get technical information?  Thanks in advance.

Apparently that type of carb or something veeeery similar was used in a
number of F*rd vehicles.  If you've got a public library with old auto
repair books, find a book for the (memory may be faulty here) 73 or 74
P*nto, or 74-76 C*pri, or possibly some of the old M*stang II.  Compare
their carb diagram with your carb.

Alternatively, order a carb rebuild kit from the FLAPS.  Adjustment info for
only about $15 and you get a free carb rebuild kit.  :-)
