&gt;Are you sure it's not DI (dee eye) instead of D1 (dee one)?

&gt;My copy of Tom Wilson's book lists a DI code as being a replacement
&gt;case.  It says about these replacement cases &quot;sold only over the
&gt;counter, not supplied in new cars.  All are dual-relief and have 10mm
&gt;oil passages.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The book also says of the DI cases:  &quot;Sometimes a 40-HP part.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;I see no other listings in this table for cases that have codes starting
&gt;with D.  
*****************************************

One of the first things about learning the part numbering, VIN and other
serial number/letter sequences with Volkswagen is they NEVER use the letter
I or O because it is too easily confused with the numbers 1 and 0.

I'm sure this is a misprint in Tom Wilson's book (again mistaking a &quot;1&quot; for
an &quot;I&quot;).

&quot;D&quot; Engines were 40HP 1200's originally installed in European Beetles (and
I'm sure elsewhere in the world) from 1966 on and replacement 40HP cases
also came with &quot;D&quot; prefixes as well, while they were in production.
