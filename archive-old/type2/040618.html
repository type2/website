WOO HOO!!
	I just have to gloat to the VW populace about my nw purchase.  It really
seems like I'm in this for the long haul.
	Ok, and update.  first I bought a '75 camper that had a LOT more rust on it
than I initially thought.  Bummer.  But, the engine and tranny were in
workable shape, so i fixed that, and replaced the top.
	Second I found a '73 Westy, which was rust free and had an impeccable
interior.  I snagged that for next to nothing, even though it had no engine,
and an auto-tranny with a broken bell housing.  I am cleaning up the floor
(the windows leackd and caused a bit of floor surface rust), and trying to
decide what to do about the non-0functioning AC (no compressor).
	JUST TODAY, I found an '81 Vanagon 7 passenger which is in terriffic shape!
The engine is very strong with the FI in tact and working like a charm.  It
only has 2 rust spots, and both of those are on the sliding door.  The
steering needs to be tightened, and a few bits and parts are broken, but
otherwise it was a great deal.
	Here is why I am very excited.  I stripped a Vanagon Westy, earlier, of
it's camping interior.  This included the stove, sink, fridge stuff.  I was
saving it to put nto the '75, with a bit of modification, but this will work
out much much better.  I'll put it in the Vanagon and make a camper out of
it!  I'll actually be able to go camping this summer!
	I'll also have 2 campers!  The '73 will be absolutely beautiful once I
clean her up and put the priginal interior back in.

	Ok, now that that is done, i can get down to business.  The Vanagon
interior is without the z-bed (if that is even what they call it in the
Vanagon years), so I am looking for one.  It is the only part I need to make
this camper work.  I'll worry about installing a pop-top later.  So, if
anyone in the North West happens to have a z-bed for a Vanagon, I'd be
really interested in talking to you.

Thanks a bunch,
