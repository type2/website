Subject: Air flow meter price...

I've got a '77 Bus Type2 2.0 FI, yadda yadda yadda, and it's been running
really bad.  The mechanic I just took it to told me the Air Flow meter
needed replacing.  He quoted me $413 for a new Bosch unit. 

Can anyone tell me if this is a reasonable price, or if I'm getting hosed by
this guy?

Thanks in advance,
Marcus
