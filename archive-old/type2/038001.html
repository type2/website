While we're on the subject of American Science &amp; Surplus -- this place
is great! All kinds of possibilities...

I ordered the Super Magnet (32059) to put between my Coleman stovetop
and cover to stop it from rattling when I drive. Works fine and doesn't
scratch anything up, because it's coated with plastic. I also got a
little mini 12v dustbuster for $5. Cain't beat that with a stick! :-)
