dear list:
i am almost done with the rebuild of a 1.8 motor for my 74 westy, with the
lists help, and have run into a problem. i am installing hydralic cam,
lifters, and pushrods into an otherwise stock 1.8. it seems the hyd pushrods
are too short, 10 1/4 in. and the rockers will not adjust out to them. are
there different sizes of hyd pushrods? the stock solid lifter pushrods are
the right size, 10 1/2 in., and the rockers will adjust on them.
is it possible to use the solid lifter pushrods on hyd?  what am i missing
here?
thanks for any input.
wishing i would have went with a raby....
