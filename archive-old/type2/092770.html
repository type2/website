&gt;Have the  $2.00 valve seat replaced and that head rebuilt.
&gt;Want to get fancy ? Do both heads. They probably both need it.
&gt;Replacing one head only will require matching compression
&gt;chamber volumes, this is what we call &quot;cc the heads &quot;.
&gt;You would be extremely lucky to buy a single matching
&gt;replacement head, so have yours measured and rebuilt.

This is very, very good advice and I agree with every word of it.  Have the 
existing head rebuilt and get back to enjoying your bus!  If you find you 
need to open the case, you will end up rebuilding the whole engine (or at 
least paying as much as that would cost).
