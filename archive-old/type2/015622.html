&gt;Hey sean, The thing I like most about that powerstroke is the 2nd gear take
&gt;off's just like first gear, even with 1,000 pounds of goodies in the cargo

OK, Jake, pleasepleaseplease tell us about your brake upgrades to haul all
that mass back down from what sounds like an easy 80 mph cruising speed.
How do you affix the tool boxes so they don't bang around in the corners.
I've always thought spot welding 3/4&quot; angle irons to the floor would be the
way to go for a mobile shop vehicle. Perhaps short sections of pipe to set
the Hazet Assistant tool trolly wheels in so they wouldn't fly forward when
a deer/dog/kid appears in a moment of inattention???
