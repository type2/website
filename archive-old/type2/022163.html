Subject: Timing notch on an '81 vanagon
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990517131804.00a76d40_at_pop-2.iastate_dot_edu&gt;

I'm trying to adjust the timing in my '81 vanagon (calif) since I've just
replaced my distributor... I'm wondering if I'm looking at the correct
timing notch.  From earlier posts I've learned that the timing indicator is
a small notch in the pulley (which looks like someone took a hacksaw to
it).  I've found a couple of these 'notches' on my pulley... which one is
correct?  One I found was on the outer diameter of the pulley on the front
side of the belt (front of course being toward the front of the vanagon).
The other is on the backside of the belt on the outer diameter of the
pulley.  Does anyone with a similar vehicle know if one of these 'notches'
is the correct timing indicator???
