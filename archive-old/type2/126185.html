That would only describe the female spaded terminal found in the rest of the electrical system not the FI connectors.

&gt;so with the help of other list members i found
&gt;the crimper and crimper dies that i want.  know i just need to find the

&gt;i went to my local old school electronics shop and we 
&gt;looked through their year 2000 amp catalog but it wasn't in there
&gt;so i am sitting here
&gt;trying to match the pins to the ones i am finding on amps site.  the
&gt;problem is that i amfinding to many pins!

Get the printed AMP Junior Timer catalog.
