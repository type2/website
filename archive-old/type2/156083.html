Subject: Dead '77

Okay, I'm stumped. I'm beginning to see why folks put carbs on these  
beasts.

'77
2 liter
Stock FI.
Wife's bus.

Driving to work last week, it quit about two blocks from home. Quit  
like someone turned off the key.

Troubleshooting so far:

New points/condenser
New plugs. (Old were wet with fuel.)
New air cleaner element
Chk fuel pressure. (36 psi)
Chk dwell and timing (static)

Symptoms:

Crank with throttle wide open and after a minute or so it attempts to  
fire. Will kinda run as long as key is in start position. Release key  
from start position and engine immediately quits.
Disconnect AFM from S-hose and it lights right off runs well for 3 or  
4 seconds.
Disconnect cold-start injector makes no difference.
Coil has 12v with key on and key in start position.
Fuel pump loud, but delivering 36 psi key on, engine off. Can't keep  
it running long enough to chk running pressure. Loud means time for  
new filter, but it ought to idle....
Temp sensor 2 in spec.

At this point, it really 'feels' like an ignition problem, but  
testing does not confirm.

Anyone care to venture opinions?

Thanks.

Jim
