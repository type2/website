Subject: RE: [T2] help! - CD install

I know that Crutchfield sells a &quot;universal&quot; mounting kit for radios. I think
it's like $10 or something. I'm a big fan of Crutchfield if only for the
reason that they ship all the stupid tools and mounting equipment you need
for your car at no additional cost. Made the install of my dad's birthday
present CD player for his 2003 Ranger the easiest I've ever done. I used one
of the universal kits on my Ford Econoline truck and mounted the CD player
from the roof, like  a trucker's CB. The kit would work on a VW as well, but
you'd have to rig up some sort of support for the back of unit, but you
could screw the top of the front to the bottom of the dash.
