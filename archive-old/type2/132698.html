Subject: RE: [T2] CDI question - Spark PLug Gap

Now if you want to talk about ignition wires, I don't think there are
any built better than Magnacor race wires. http://www.magnecor_dot_com/
Their website is a wealth of information even if you don't purchase
their wires.

I have Magnacor KV85s on my Jetta. I'll probably never have to replace
them.
