&lt;&lt; On a side note, I'm using 10W-30 Castrol Synthetic. Should I be using 40
 weight oil? &gt;&gt;

I've always lived in the west and summers are hot!  20W-50 is good if you 
face significant summer heat.  If your engine doesn't leak much, consider  the 
further added protection of a good synthetic.

Lifters will be noisy.....  they seem to keep doing their job though.

Below is some information from another list that Porsche published on their 
oil preferences for their aircooled engines.  

&quot;VW has long ignored their air-cooled heritage. We are denied benefit from 
their thinking about modern engine oils in our older engines. The other day 
someone on another email list indicated that Porsche, unlike VW, has gone back and 
re-evaluated the engineering behind engine oil choices for their older 
machines, and published new recommendations for them.

This information comes from a June 1993, Porsche Classic GmbH press release. 
&quot;Regarding engines: 356, 356A, B, C, 914-4, 914-6, 916, 911 (all), 912. The 
Porsche Classic car engines, (listed), were built to fit the oils available 
at that time. These oils are in general no longer available today. The 
following aspects must be considered to meet with the demands of classic car 
engines: -The bearings of the above listed engines show more tolerance. 
-Synthetic oils are not adequate for most gaskets.
Therefore, engine oils of at least API classification SE/CC should be used in 
the following viscosity:

        Summer/warm areas              Winter/cold areas
        SAE 20w-40                     SAE10w-30
        SAE 20w-50                     SAE15w-40
        SAE40                          SAE15w-50

   The oils must have been produced in conventional processing.

                         BP  15w-50
