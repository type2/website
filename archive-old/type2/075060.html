Subject: Re: [T2] oil leak on a 75

My guess would be a holed piston.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;  i went down to pick up my new 75 westy butit was leaking oil so bad and
&gt; smoking so bad that i couldnt drive it.
&gt; It is leaking in a steady drip from the dipstick tube. when i removed the
&gt; stick from the tube it poured out. I dont have to much oil in it, the only
&gt; think I can thing is the case has to much back pressure. I am new to these
&gt; motors so I am learning, I am gonna refer to my manual as well.
&gt; Any ideas anyone?
