Subject: Warming Up

 I won't bother to argue one side or the other of this debate.

 I wrote a blurp for the U.S.Navy once that went something like this:

 All the parts of an engine are designed a certain size to fit into 
the adjacent part of a certain size etc.

 All this is assuming that all the parts are the same temperature
and so on . 

 Tolerances etc. are established at operating temperature of 180 deg.

 When you first start up an engine the whole thing is cold.
All the parts being the same temp. fit alright etc.
 
 The oil is like sludge and requires huge amounts of energy to function at
all from the &quot;too tight&quot; condition the oil imparts to adjacent components.

 It's called &quot;hysterisis&quot;. Aren't you impressed? :-)

 Cold is anything under operating temp.

 Once you've lit the fires, it starts to warm up and all the various parts
grow.  Since they are different metals, they grow at different 
rates.

 The oil in the meantime is sucking up all the heat instead of 
passing it thru to mating part.
 It will eventually pass the heat out to the colder parts of the engine and
tends to buffer the heat shock.
 This takes time however.

 The aluminum piston expands at a faster rate than the steel cylinder.

The part closest to the flame sucks up the heat and expands before
the adjacent part even starts to recieve heat.

 The gaskets are hard and the head bolts are loose.

 The brass bushing expands like hell while the  gudgeon pin is still 
cold and undersized.

 The heat and expansion slowly works it's way out to the parts farthest from
the combustion chamber.

 Until the entire engine reaches operating temperature, you have a 
machine with tolerances all over the place. Some tight, some loose,
oil that's too thick.

 All of the above contribute to excessive wear and poor operating 
efficiency.

- - - - - - 

Or you can have the conspiracy theory. 

 If that car the manufacturer reccomends no warm up on doesn't wear
out in X number of years then how can they sell parts or a new one?

 I have had a V.P. come up and have me change the hardness spec on a
part that would cause it to break.

 We weren't selling enough replacements and the parts pimp was complaining.

 In all seriousness, the &quot;Powers&quot; don't want that car to run forever.
