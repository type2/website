Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Short 

Rae,

Yep, it can be pretty overwhelming.  My suggestion is to start
with one wire and see where it goes.  Then go back to bentley and
do the same thing.

At this point, what does &quot;random missfire&quot; mean??...exactly

What I understand as &quot;random missfire&quot; may be entirely something different 
to you...this is a problem in every business I have ever worked in...and 
when I had a shop, I *did* listen to how people described their 
problem.&lt;grin&gt;

If this &quot;random missfire&quot; is caused by the points being bad, then
no big deal.  If it is because one of the two to 8 wires that 
help in the ignition process is worn out or the insulation is worn
off of them, then that is a visual thing.

First to do is read about checking the hi tension ignition wires(to the 
plugs and coil)....the &quot;fat&quot; ones..
Pull them off one at a time and test them...put them back on before you 
look at the next one.

After that are the smaller 12 volt wires like the one from the coil to the 
distributor and the wire from the coil to the FI system.  After that are 
the wires that feed power to the coil.  I have seen coil connections that 
were loose before as well.

Pick a wire, look at both ends of it, look it over for insulation breaks,
wigggle it, wiggle where it goes to...look at the crimps on the 
connectors that it uses, is it tight?....and *look* at it!]

Good luck, dave

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; a random missfire. It's constantly throughing the
&gt; points and timing out of wack!!!  But I'm feeling
&gt; intimidated by about finding this short.
&gt; 
&gt; I sort of get how to check for them: I have a test
&gt; light and full wiring digram, every manual including
&gt; Bently.  Have 72 bus retro-fitted with 76 FI
&gt; Drivetrain.

&gt; So, any ideas on how to do this? Where do some of you
&gt; start? One end of the digram, one end of the engine
&gt; compartment?  I feel if I can just get started
&gt; somewhere and in an organized fasion I'll be okay. I'm
&gt; a girl (woman) and need a ciber hug and some moral
&gt; support, oh and yah some practical
&gt; electical/mechanical advice. Any help you can give
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Rae
