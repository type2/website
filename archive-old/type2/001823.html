Subject: BN4 info

Don't want to continue to pester the whole list on this subject but in spite
of all the info in the library I'm still confused about my recent
acquisition of a BN4 heater which appears to be in very good shape. If
someone could answer some questions I'd be forever grateful....

1) I see references made to &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; BN4's. How can I tell which
one I have?

2) Does anyone have any photos of the complete duct work for one that would
fit into a 1978 standard Bus? All I have is the large plastic intake and a
two- piece unit that has the control switch. This is all I have. I imagine
it won't get me very far past the gas tank area.

3) Does anyone still have templates for cutting the holes?

4) Does anyone have and want to sell the above mentioned duct work and I'm
also missing the Push/pull control switch.
