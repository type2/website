Subject: Re:loosening disc brakes

The spring that pushes the pedal back up was broken when I got my bus 
causing the pedal to hold on slightly after it had been pushed. This caused 
the engine to stall when I attempted to move off from the lights causing 
everyone, including me, to think evil thoughts about 30yo VWs!
