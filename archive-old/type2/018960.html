I've got both.  The 'one man bleeder works for about 99% of the jobs.
The vacuum pump covers the other 1%.  It is also useful for other odd
jobs, like testing vacuum advances, pumping jack oil into the floor jack
(put the hose on the outlet port, fill the jar with oil and pump away.),
testing smog devices on other than VWs, etc.

When the vacuum pumps first came out, they were about $75.  Now they
make 'em out of plastic and they're about $20.  For that price, it's a
good tool to have around.  The one man bleeders?  I've found that the
cheap ones do a better job than the more expen$ive ones.  I think that I
spent about two bucks for the one that I use the most.
