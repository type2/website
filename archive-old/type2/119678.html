&lt;&lt; Has anyone out there stripped the padding from a Bay dash? Is the metalwork
underneath useable as a dash if painted?

Doing that &quot;might&quot; cause problems with whatever safety inspection(s) your
particular state requires...Another problem &quot;might&quot; be with insurance if 
someone is hurt in the bus...Removing the crash padding is technically il-
legal (as is removing any safety or emissions related equipment...)
