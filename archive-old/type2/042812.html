consider that many of my customers are reporting these results with the new
Quaker State FULL (not blend) synthetic 5-50.

Oil temp dropping 20-30 degrees, and head temps staying the same or
dropping.

That's good on both counts. I believe that &quot;synthetic myth&quot; was true 15
years ago, but not anymore.

&gt; &gt; I have a new engine with 3000 miles. I use 40wt. castrol.That was what
the
&gt; &gt; builder sugested. 40wt from memorial day to halloween then 30wt from
&gt; &gt; then back to mem.day. Does anyone think synthetic woild be better?
&gt;
&gt; More expensive, and there are issues with synthetics being less capable of
&gt; carrying off heat than conventional mineral oils.
