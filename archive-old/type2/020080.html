then take a detour to Nevada, into Las Vegas. Do any list members know of any 
dangerous high mountains/roads to avoid out there?? How hot does it get in
&gt;the desert in November??

November is perhaps the trickiest month for weather predictions here in the 
desert.  The early part of the month can still see highs in the 80s however, 
closer to Thanksgiving it has actually &quot;snowed&quot; twice in the last 12 years 
I've lived here.  Generally however, it is the wind as opposed to the 
temperature that is more of a problem.

Leaving Las Vegas to the South on I-15 you will have one really steep climb 
right at the CA/NV border.  Then two smaller climbs before you get the Cajon 
pass.  You might want to break the trip from Vegas to LA/Riverside up into two 
days and stop overnight in Baker or Calico (a ghost town/tourist attraction).

If you need any more Vegas advice, feel free to p-mail and I'll steer toward 
nice things that don't involve casinos or showgirls if you want.
