dear list:

i am having a dilemma with my 77 campmobile, and appeal to the list for
advice.

past:
i bought the bus in mid-july for $3,300 (overpaid, i know...i wanted a bus.).
body in decent shape, motor rebuilt last october (receipts to prove it). spent
$450 on new tires.

i tried to do my first tune-up a couple of weeks ago (points &amp; timing), with
the result that the bus wouldn't start. i had it towed to a mechanic nearby.
turns out i had blown out the combi-relay somehow, presumably from all those
starts and stops when i was doing the timing. waited 2 weeks for the part to
arrive.

present:
mechanic told me today that there is definitely bottom-end rod noise coming
out of the motor. i called a place in the area that specializes in VWs and
they gave me a ballpark price of $2,800 to rebuild the motor.

future:
options that have occured to me: 1) see if the PO will give me some money
back. 2) bail out -- try to sell this one at a significant loss and try a
different bus. 3) bite the bullet and have the work done.

i live in an apartment (3rd floor), and it's just not possible for me to try
to do this rebuild myself right now. is $2,800 too much, or is that really the
going rate? almost sounds like i could get a new motor for that.

if someone can offer a more palatable solution than those i have considered,
please let me know.

thanks,
carl
