if the shaking is felt most strongly thru the steering wheel when
braking than your rotors
are not running true this happens once in a while you just got lucky. If
you cant find any
other reason the shaking have the rotors
trued or take the back I would try taking the back first vw only allows
one refaceing on
rotors.  luck   let me know how you make out
gentery
save the buses


I forgot to mention that I had the machine shop where I bought the rotors
and drums check them for &quot;true&quot; and they were fine. I have had that problem
before so I made sure before I did the work.  I trust this machine shop
since they have been in business since the 60's and I have dealt with them
for about 15 years.  They also specialize in VW's and are extremely
knowledgeable.
