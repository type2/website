Subject: www.busesofthecorn_dot_com is back up (finally :)

and www.everybus_dot_com is still up.

Both thanks to Tom Tarka who just stepped in and reconfigured Apache.

I would also like to thank

Jason (jasonatfasterlastercom),
Steve Pribyl (steveatunliketeacom),
Alex Wisniewski (awisniewskiatcomcastnet),
Mike Begley (spamathellorg),
Dylan Baxter (dylan_baxterathotmailcom), and
Jason Thorpe (thorpejatwasabisystemscom).

Y'all provided valuable suggestions and if you had been providing them to
someone with a clue ti probably woulda worked :-)

Steve
