&gt;Volks,

&gt;Formerly CA-emissioned 78 Westy 2.0L...
&gt;
&gt;Five questions quickly:
&gt;
&gt;With the removal of the catalytic converter _at_ rebuild and installation of 
&gt;all new exhaust components, I had my mechanic weld shut the feed to the EGR 
&gt;valve which runs from the infamous cross-over pipe.

Note: Last time I checked, a civil penalty of $2500 may be imposed for 
rendering any emission control device or element of design inoperative.
I assume you are talking about off road use.

I now have a huge vacuum-ish leak _at_ the EGR
&gt;where it bolts to the manifold, lots of sucking. I can feel the negative 
&gt;pressure with my hand around the unit. Leak is present _at_ idle and increases 
&gt;corresponding to engine RPM. Upon removal of the valve, I discovered lots 
&gt;of icky brown gook - basically it looked like this thing had seen much 
&gt;better days. I cleaned it best I could, installed a new gasket and set it 
&gt;tight. Still a leak. The suction seems to be coming from the screw 
&gt;adjustment on the outboard side of the valve. Q1: How does this leak affect 
&gt;engine performance?

Increases air fuel ratio. Could damage engine if it gets too high. Engine 
might seem very peppy just before it blows a jug.


&gt;Q2: Could I have someone fabricate a blocking plate and install it with a 
&gt;gasket, since I don't need EGR functionality?

Yes.

&gt;Q3: What is the sensor that energizes the CAT idiot light? Is it the O2 
&gt;sensor? Where is it?

No you don't have an O2 sensor on the 78 (79 is first year)

My  idiot light is of course
&gt;permanently lit. Other than simply pulling the light from behind the 
&gt;instrument cluster, can I do something w/ the sensor to make this go away?

This sensor is activated by a mechanical counter driven from the speedo. It 
can be reset by pushing the reset button but I forget how.

&gt;Q4: How does the lack of a CAT and the energized CAT idiot light effect 
&gt;engine performance?

No effect.

Is the ECU making calculations based
&gt;on what it perceives as poor exhaust emissions?

No

If so, how can I
&gt;fix this?

&gt;Q5: I think my #3 CHT sender is bad *again*. What test can I perform with a 
&gt;VOM to check it?

If you mean Temp sensor II, resistance vs temperature is of interest.

Should I check connectivity -

No harm. Could save you $25 for a new part.

&gt;and what numbers should I be getting?

roughly 300 to 3000 ohms hot to cold.

Does the lead to the
&gt;sender need to be soldered (mine is butt-crimped)?

No, solder is better but not required.
