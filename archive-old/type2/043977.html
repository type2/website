Subject: [T2] 1978 VW Bus..Champagne Edition

Part of the fleet of my non-running buses...includes...
a 1978 Champagne Edition..7 seater...

(for those not familiar w/this model..this will be the
two tone red over dark brown passenger van, with 2 tone
corduroy seats, quartz clock in dash...etc..)

Can the knowledgable list tell me...how rare this model is??
How many built ?

I hate to use this one for parts !  But unfortunately
this one needs,.......

1. another motor
2. body work.( the usual side panels, wheel arches, batt tray)
3. tires/brakes...ad nauseum...

however...interior is next to mint condition.....

What does list say?  Worth fixing..or take parts/trim pieces
to another Bus  and call it a Champagne Edition.???
