If you have a new muffler kit, just weld up the old one till your ready to
make the change over.

Hi All,

	I took my 70 Westy on its first camping trip this past weekend to
Transporters by the Tunnel in north Adams, Ma. Had a great time. I made sure
I did not lug the engine going up the very steep hills and actually came to
trust my brakes (non power drum brakes will stop, it just takes more pedal
pressure than I am used to). All went well except for loosing my tailpipe on
the way. It came clean out of the muffler, probably because the bracket that
holds it against the muffler had broken. I have a new Ernst exhaust from bus
depot, but really want to wait until this winter before I start doing
anything that may require the removal of the heads, I just know that at
least one of those pesky exhaust studs will break off, and I have another
camping trip planed in about a week. Can I just go ahead and us my mig
welder to reattach the whole thing? I have been itching to try the welder
out, bought it a few months ago and have not used it yet. Any tips or
cautions from anyone who has tried this before? If I ruin it, I can always
go ahead and bolt on the new exhaust. any info would be appreciated.

Jeff
