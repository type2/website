Subject: Good Replacement Panel's

Hello,

I am about to replace the floors in the cab area of my 72 westy. Rather than 
simply weld in a patch of sheet metal. I would like to get an authentic or 
as original as possible looking replacement panel. I have heard of A.H. 
Schofield (overseas) that has very original and good quality panels. Are 
there any such suppliers of &quot;the pond&quot; that has the same quality replacement 
panels?

Thanks in Advance, Phil.
