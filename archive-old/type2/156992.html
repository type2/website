Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

&gt; I have a long wire that I will draw from my rear
&gt; window heater switch on the
&gt; dash (remove the existing wire connection) down to
&gt; the fuel pump.  When I
&gt; want the fuel pump to pump, I will pull the switch
&gt; on.  This should shoot
&gt; 12.5 volts down to the fuel pump.

How about instead of that, pull the (+) spade
connector off of the fuel pump and check the voltage
at the wire when not hooked to the pump (while partner
cranks engine so power is being sent.)

That eliminates the possibility that the pump is
drawing way too much current and drawing the voltage
down. If the pump IS drawing way too much current,
your workaround could result in a fire quite easily.

If you must do a workaround, why not attach a jumper
to the pump (+) with its normal supply wire
disconnected and then attach the other end of your
jumper to the battery (+) terminal while holding it so
you can quickly pull it away. You should be able to
hear it run.  Just some thoughts. Hope it helps. -BaH
