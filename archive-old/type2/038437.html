&gt; I have a 77 Westy (lime green). Decided to buy new rubber, so I read 
&gt; everything anybody had to say about tires on type2. Armed with this info, I 
&gt; called my local tire guy and asked for 195/75R14 C tires with reinforced 
&gt; sidewalls.
&gt; 
&gt; He says he has a Toyo tire, grade C made for light trucks and SUV's. So he 
&gt; installs them today (great deal all 4 installed/balanced $210), I pick it up 
&gt; and I find the tires are not C rated. They turn out to be Toyo 185/75R14 
&gt; 92S.

First off, 185/75's are to short for a bus....185R14 or 195/75R14 would be
near to correct.

&gt; According the Toyo_dot_com the tires specs are:
&gt; Ratings
&gt; UTQG Treadwear 380
&gt; UTQG Traction A
&gt; UTQG Temperature B
&gt; M and S Rated
&gt; Max PSI 35
&gt; Max Load 1400

Looks like the guy owes you a full refund, as these are .not. the tires
that you need.

If you are not looking for an aggressive tread pattern, I've found the
Bridgestone 603 (or the like...) an excellent tire, as long as its on
pavement.  dirt, sand, and gravel, it sucks.  but rain or dry, it is MUCH
better then i expected.

it is available in a load C, as well as a load D, in both (if i recall)
185R14 and 195/75R14 (I have the 195's on my bus right now..).  Tire rack
sells them for something like 63 each.

The Yokohama 356 has a very similar tread, and probably functions just the
same.  It is available also in C, D and 185R14 or 195/75R14....I've never
tried these, but many on the list have.  About 10 bucks cheaper, if memory
serves, also from the tires rack (www.tirerack_dot_com).

I keep hearing rumors that the mroe aggressive yokohama 370 has been
discontinued in the last version that was available...but then, i've been
hearing that for years and have bought (or assisted in purchasing) 3 sets.
These are an excellent M+S all terrain tire.  They love rain, mud, snow,
ice, dry, loose, etc.  I highley recommend these tires if you cna find
them.  Price was around 60 each if memory serves, but it likely doesnt.
They .do not. like bad front ends, they will burn the tread off .very.
fast.  so fix those sloppy ball joints, and tie rods and get a .good.
alignment before you dirve on these!

good luck...
