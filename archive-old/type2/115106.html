&gt; I don't know if it was lacquer or enamel--but from what he told me a
&gt; good paint job took a month. &gt;&gt;

&gt; Nitrocellulose lacquer, IIRC...

This came later. The earlier finish was simply called Japanese Varnish or
Japanese Lacquer and it was applied by brush: the same way that horse drawn
buggies were painted.
