Oh yeah, I totally agree.

At the time I thought it was funny. :)

&gt; My only complaint is that... the box clearly stated: &quot;KEEP REFRIGERATED&quot;
in
&gt; big bold letters down the side of the box.

I got my stuff in a box that ceramics were originally sold in. My wife
thought I had started buying off HSN.

=D

Seriously, I like that they reuse boxes. Better than them ending up in
the trash or even recycled.
