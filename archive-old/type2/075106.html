&gt;I bought a bus with a seized 1800 (bus is 75), the motor had been 
&gt;converted to dual webers (34 ICT).  They look very new.  I replaced the 
&gt;seized motor with a used 2.0 L engine.  Does anyone know if I will need to 
&gt;change the jetting in these carbs to accomadate the bigger motor?

Probably not.  It's possible that the mixture could lean out a little at 
high rpms with the 2-liter vs. the 1800 but I didn't find that to be the 
case when I made the same switch.  A smaller air correction jet would 
probably take care of that issue if it existed.

&gt;I am assuming that these were jetted properly for the 1800 when they were 
&gt;purchased.  When i put them on the 2.0 L, and adjusted them some, the 
&gt;thing ran like a top, now it is cutting out and stalling, and the problem 
&gt;has progressed severely.  I am wondering if these carbs need to be rebuilt 
&gt;and rejetted.  I am assuming the problem is definately in the carbs.

Might be, but it's not due to the effect of more displacement on the 
jetting.  By all means you need to verify what jets are actually in the 
carbs so that nice 2.0 engine can enjoy a full and productive life.
