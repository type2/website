Subject: Re: [T2] 8.5 volts at FI fuel pump - what's up??

Richard, what you say is good.  And it makes sense.  I will check these
positions on the double relay.

I imagined the double relay to be a simple yes/no thing.  I get voltage, yes
or no.  I don't know where the difference in 12.5 and 8.5 is getting off to,
and I want to try a workaround.  How about this:

I have a long wire that I will draw from my rear window heater switch on the
dash (remove the existing wire connection) down to the fuel pump.  When I
want the fuel pump to pump, I will pull the switch on.  This should shoot
12.5 volts down to the fuel pump.

I will just add this wire to the existing power/ground connections on the
fuel pump.

Now, this should bring out the naysayers, and hopefully someone to explain
where the other 4 volts suddenly went off to...

Barry sends

&gt; The AFM is just the switch. You should check the output from the relay at
&gt; 88d and the voltage from the battery at 88y and 88z:

&gt; 85 - Ground
&gt; 86 - Thermo time switch and ECU pin 4
&gt; 86a - Starter
&gt; 86b - AFM harness connector #36
&gt; 86c - Terminal 15 of ignition coil (+12v)
&gt; 88a - AFM harness connector #39
&gt; 88b - Series resistors and ECU pin 10
&gt; 88c - Aux air regulator
&gt; 88d - Fuel Pump
&gt; 88y - Battery +12v
&gt; 88z - Battery +12v
