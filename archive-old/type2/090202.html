Subject: Windshield glass

Woohoo!  Safelite just finished installing a new
windshield in my 73 Westy.  
Wow!  When you sit in it it's as if there's nothing in
front of you.  $190 installed at my location (using my
existing 4-year old seal).  
******************************************************

I just had a new windshield put in my 79 Westy and
after calling around and asking many questions
regarding glass manufacture that each one uses, I
finally had a company come out to my house and install
USA made PPG tinted glass for a total price of 110$ I
furnished a new seal which cost me $19 from the local
FLAPS. The metal/paint under the old seal still looked
brand new but they still put a rust treatment on and
when that was dry they put new sealer around the
frame. Overall I am very happy with the fit and
quality of the install. 
The estimates I had received were between $110 and
$195 with the high bid and the low bid both using the
same glass.
I can see clearly now!
