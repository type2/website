Subject: re:'71-'72 rotors (brake)

Woops, I left the word 'brake'.  That is what I was having problems finding.  Anyway, problem solved.

I just got new barely used german Brake rotors, with hubs attached and new bearings installed for $35 bucks a piece.  I lucked out and a local VW shop proprietor had just gotten in a rebuilt front '72 bus axle and all he wanted was the axle itself so he sold me the rotor/hub/bearing combo.

Thanks though for the responses.

Paul
