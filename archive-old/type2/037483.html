Subject: repost: bits FS/trade in UK

Yet again, I post to the list and it disappears into the ether.  How
annoying.

&gt;From a 2l 1978 Devon camper:

  clutch pedal and assy
  clutch tube
  gear level and linkages
  manual tranny (without CVs and shafts)

I bought this as a lot with the intention of converting my '73 auto to
manual. But I don't have the time or the inclination, nor will I have in
the forseeable future.

&gt;From my 1700 '73 Westphalia camper:

  clip-on headrests
  under-dash shelf
  rear right 3/4 window and open 1/4 window (no seals)

These are just the bits I don't want on my camper.

Cheers,

Chris - North Yorkshire.
