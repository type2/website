Subject: Re: [T2] ??vacuum adv. cutoff valve

Hello &amp; thanks for the response:

The retard hose on here is connected to the port on the back side of the 
throttle body facing you. The advance is connected to the port on the other side. 
Towards the front of the bus. I do now see where the plugged hose goes on the 
AFM (broken, nach).
009 is the last 3 numbers on the side of the distributor. The &quot;sending disk&quot; 
I 
refer to is the &quot;Hall sending unit.&quot; You can rotate the rotor to the right, 
let go, and it
snaps back. When you rotate the sending unit to the left, it should do the 
same
thing. Which it does not. I'm fiddling with all this to see if the knocking I 
get in the
engine on acceleration is because of it over advancing. I was looking at 
Atwell's
vac. hose diagrams and I see there is some more hose connections to be fixed
( EEC stuff). I don't have it timed at 5A b/c it just acts to retarded. I 
step on the
gas (normally) and let out the clutch (normally) and the engine, like, goes 
into
&quot;slow motion.&quot; After about 3 sec. of this it just takes off. That sounds like 
too
much retard to me. Well...Back to the drawing board. I'll start getting ready 
for the engine to come out, I guess. Thanks for your imput.
