 Hope this hasn't been beaten to death, but can
 someone advise on where they put the oil filter on a
 '71 bus?  I tapped my case for a full-flow system
 last year, and am in the process of making some other
 repairs and would like to move the filter out of the
 engine compartment.  Gene Berg says to mount the
 thing on the engine cross member, but how it fits,
 they shed no light. Seems too tight to mount it
 behind and left of the cross member, and no way it
 fits in front of the cross member as the muffler is
 right there. The Empi mounting bracket I'm using has
 the inlet/outlet ports facing left.   How have you
 folks mounted it?  
 
 &gt;&gt;
I had the same question about two weeks ago and was having the same problem
that you were with the location that Gene Berg recommends.  I mounted mine on
the left side of the frame where the rear engine mount is.  I drilled three
holes in the frame which I am not to sure is a good idea but thought it would
be the best place to mount it away from the muffler and to have enough ground
clearance under it.  It is also in a good location to change it.  Most of the
filter is also protected from the rear wheel by the fender well.  I was going
to mount it further (front) up the frame but I felt that the tire might get in
the way.  I made sure to paint the holes that I drilled so that they will not
rust.  I do not think that I made the frame any weaker.  I did have to rent an
angle drill to get the job done ,as there was not enough room for a regular
drill.  I shold have drilled and tapped the holes for the bolts which would
have been a cleaner install.
