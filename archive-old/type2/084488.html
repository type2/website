Subject: RE: [T2] synchro 1st?  &amp; defrost Q

&gt;&gt; what your supposed to use the clutch when changing gears while moving???
Bob &lt;&lt;

I know what Tony was saying.  He appears to be a Joisy Italian, but I think
he learned to drive in Scandinavia where clutching is taught as an option.
=)  With a full synchro trans you *can* shift w/o using the clutch, even in
an acvw.  I guess it's meant to save the clutch.  Seems to be though, that a
clutch is easier and cheaper to replace than blown synchros.  Leave the
speed shifting to the Hondas.  It's a bus for cryin' out loud.  All I'm
doing is trying to save my valves.

Thanks for confirming that I have a worn synchro.  How 'bout the defroster?
