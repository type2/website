&gt; Correct replacement tire must bear word
&gt; &quot;REINFORCED&quot;.  The maximum inflation pressure
&gt; listed on the tire should be 40 psi.

&gt; No where in Bentley will you see Load Range C or
&gt; D.  No where.

The Bentley manual is a reprint of the VW manual and is not updated with
time.  Its data is circa 1980.  The tire designations have changed.
