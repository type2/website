There's more to it than just a good book.  Last night I scanned 12 pages of
tools for the project.  The book you need is the VW workshop manual, Section
H.  Granted, some of the tools are repeated on multiple pages because they
are used for multiple steps.  Start saving your pennies because, when you
can find them, tranny tools are expensive.  The first, and most important
tool for getting it back together correctly, is 289d -- mandrel and dial
indicator.

&gt; &gt;The info in the Muir book isn't sketchy at all. John Muir specifically
&gt; says
&gt; &gt;to stay the hell out of the transmission. He says you have to be in
&gt; practice
&gt; 
&gt; OK, maybe it is impractical to rebuild my tranny completely by myself, but
&gt; I would think that I could do most of it, and take it to a machine shop to
&gt; do the things that need tools I don't have.  As VW owners, I think many of
&gt; us have a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; approach to things, and I'm continually amazed
&gt; by the creative solutions to problems that our list members come up with.
&gt; Of course, if I do try this tranny re-build thing, I'll buy a housing for
&gt; a tranny and all the parts, and work on it in the garage while I drive
&gt; with the original one.
&gt; 
&gt; So, does anyone know of a good tranny re-building book or video??
