&gt; supposedly, and I say this guardedly since I have never actually seen one,

There is a simple three contact switch labeled high/low that was sold in
some model regions (presumably Colorado) and mounted with the top screw
holding the ECU in.

15B in this diagram I believe:

I came across it in my smog research because the wrong position at low
altitudes will run you too rich and fail you.  There was also mention of a
special wiring harness with extra leads.

Was this switch still installed if the FI system had an 02 sensor?
