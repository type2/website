Subject: &quot;the hubcap&quot;...

Hi all,

Since we're collecting opinions, I believe the only &quot;hubcap&quot; is the original
one with it's carrying case/trunk and donated articles.  I think every effort
should be made to trace it to the last person transporting it (sounds like
someone did locate the current holder of the cap), and lighting a fire under
their ass to get it mobile again.  Also, I personally believe that any VW
Transporter, Splitty through Eurovan qualifies to haul it, but ONLY a VW
Transporter should haul the &quot;hubcap&quot;.

If it comes to an event near you, be sure to check out all of the signitures,
momentos, stickers and the logbook that travels with the &quot;hubcap&quot;  The
original idea is a cool one, but let's keep doing this with the original
'hubcap&quot;!
