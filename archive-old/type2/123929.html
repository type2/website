Problems


&gt; I'm attempting to install a Pertronix Ignitor electronic ignition in a
stock
&gt; distributor for a Federal air-cooled Vanagon.  Pertronix part number is
&gt; 1847V which is listed as the correct application for this model.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that the magnet sleeve doesn't fit down far enough on the
&gt; distributor shaft to allow the rotor to settle into its place.  It looks
to
&gt; be about 1/4&quot; too high.  Looking inside the magnet sleeve I see 3
&gt; &quot;shoulders&quot; that help orient the sleeve on the rotor shaft, but I'd guess
&gt; they also are preventing the sleeve from descending.
&gt;
&gt; How have others dealt with this?

Trim or file the inner plastic until it fits. This is what Pertronix tech
dept told me to do. Also gap is not critical.
