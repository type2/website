&gt; Driving off from the church in a bus would be

&gt; when my wife and i got married (before i had the bus) 
&gt; we left the wedding in our lifted jeep cj with a
&gt; couple others following behind.   we got a lot of
&gt; looks, especially since she was driving...in her
&gt; wedding dress.   anyways, congratulations!!!!!

When my wife and I were married, we left on our BMW motorcycle.  It wasn't
a VW, but  at least it was an aircooled boxer!  And yes, we got a lot of
looks between the wedding and the reception!

Congrats,
