Subject: Re: [T2] Paint Removal

Tks for the advice.  Since the bus is trapped inside
my garage since the springs on the door have broken. 
I probally won't be able to get a hose in there but
may try just a bucket of water and a rag since I
assume the water is used to neturalize the agent.  The
stripper did work great on one door but it was off a
doner car.  I'll also try the plastic wrap since it
appears that the spray is drying faster than normal.

Tks again, I'll let you know the progress

Stan
