Subject: RE: [T2] popping, and repair shop

Well this is just a list of some things to check but:

Is the gas old? Or is this happening on one tank of gas? Maybe you filled
her up with some crappy gas.

Also, is she idling rough in your driveway? You can just easily hook up
another gas tank with a fuel line to the fuel pump and see if that fixes the
problem. That would allow you to rule out the gas tank without having to
pull it out. If you find that new high octane fuel from a gas can doesn't
solve the problem, then the problem isn't in your tank... it's somewhere
else in the engine.

  Well, I guess it is up to me to get her running right.  I would love to
tear the repair shop a new you know what, and take them to court, but I
realize that that is not reality.  Here again is the background, and
symtoms.   About a month ago, I had a new fuel pump clog, and fail.  I
replaced it, and added a fuel filter before it, as well as aft.  Took it
about 50 miles down the highway with no issues.  As I got off the highway,
my bus let out a cough!  (oohh jeeez she's sick!)  I made it to my
destination, and home again with it coughing whenever there was a slight
load placed on it.  Since, I have adjusted the valves, set the timing,
checked my jet, replaced distributor, cap, rotor, plugs, and wires.  It was
still happening.  Some of that was done by the shop, along with adjusting my
air-fuel mixture.  After he replaced plugs, wires, and fuel filter, it ran
like a dream for a few miles, and then stalled in my driveway.  Now I have a
rough idle, stalling at stops, and still the infamous popping.  About thew
only thing I have not done, is to check out the screen in the tank.  This
bus has had it's time off the road, and I did not drive her this winter.  I
can't stand not having her for camping.  I miss our time together.  My poor
girl......Need help.  People on the list, what do you think?
BTW,  This is a 71 1600 DP with a 34 carb, and 055 Boshe vac dist. New
everything.
