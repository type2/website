&lt;&lt; Actually, that isn't ammonia you smell - it's an enzyme. And only about 30%
 of people produce it, and fewer than 5% can smell it. Among whom was Babe
 Ruth (and me).

Me, too.  Isn't someone smelling like ammonia an indication of some condition?

BUS CONTENT ;RE Barn storage
My '78 was stored for 10 years in a barn before I got it.  The owner had 
dispersed mothballs and D con throughout the bus, and as a result there was 
no mouse damage at all save for a small nibbled hole in the extreme rear of 
the canvas, where the smell didn't penetrate the space between the folded 
matress with the top down.
Now I store it under a storm cover with mothballs in it.  That green plaid 
would be too hard to find!
