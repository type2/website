&gt;Yea, I think that is too high! 250 is way out of bounds as far as I'm

&gt;But my current bus, a 63, with a stock 1600 single port with a doghouse
&gt;cooler only never gets hotter then 220. In fact, in 90 degree  weather
&gt;at 65 mph it stays about 210. Hills will push it higher to 220, but then
&gt;it drops off. Normally, in 80 or so weather it sits just about 190.
&gt;Different oils can handle extremes, but what is your engine saying to
&gt;you if it is running hot? Maybe you need to look at the overall picture.
&gt;I have seen 1776 and near 2000 cc engines with a doghouse keep thier

To add another data point, it was a particularly hot day here in Texas - it
was 102 at noon and 108 at 4pm (you folks in Phoenix hold the snyde
comments please!  :-]).  During this time I drove about 125 miles on the
freeway and around town.  On city streets it stayed at 220.  On the
highway, it ranged from 230 (cruising part throttle, 55-60mph) to 240+
(65-70, and when pulling hills).  Never quite hit 250.  My oil pressure was
also lower as the oil got hotter - dipped under 30psi at the hottest oil
temps.

Those kinds of temps used to really make me nervous but now I believe that
a good running engine with a good synthetic oil (I use Mobil-1 15W50  in
the summer) can handle up to 250 degrees without being harmed.  The CHT
seems to run nearly the same whether the outside temp is 10 or 110.  Guess
there is so much air flowing that it doesn't really matter.  The heads are
the weak point in the engine, and as long as the heads aren't overheating,
I'm not too worried about how hot the rest of the engine gets (within
reason).
