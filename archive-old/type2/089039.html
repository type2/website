Subject: slider windows

We got some bad info on Vanagon slider windows. They will NOT fit in a
Baywindow bus, at least not the ones we pulled and payed $60 for.

They are for sale now if you need some good ones for your Vanagon. Make an
offer.

We also need a set of slider windows to fit a Bay (we already have new
seals). I believe they were originally on the 76-79 Baywindow buses,
probably the transporter.

I am in Charlotte, NC.

Thanks,
Rob Henley
