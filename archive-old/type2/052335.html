Subject: [T2] Part Identification Help Needed

Vehicle and Area in Question:
1970 Westphalia
Brake Master Cylinder
Tubing clamps, seals, etc.

Coming from off of the brake fluid filler reservoir (bottle) up in the cab,
there is a plastic tube that comes out of the bottom of this bottle.

This plastic tube then routes downward to the brake master cylinder,
and is clamped to the inlet of the master cylinder reservoir(s).
See Fig. 3-1 in Section 5 of Bentley

On the outside of the master cylinder inlet &quot;nipple:&quot; there is a flexible 
rubber seal (sleeve) that, in turn, fits inside of this plastic tube.
See Fig. 3-3 in section 5 of Bentley

Can someone please tell me what the part number is for this rubber seal, as 
cross referenced to a RMMW part # or some other source for same?

Is it 211 611 833C(11) ??
If so, how sure are you ?

Right now, all of my brake fluid goes to the driveway at a fairly fast rate 
of flow when I pour brake fluid into the bottle.

Additionally, my clamp is still all OK for re-use, but is there some merit 
to the clamp being designed as it is ........... Why would a regular hose 
clamp not serve just as well, or will it ?

My inquiring mind wants to know.
