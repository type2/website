Subject: Re: [T2] generator nut backing off

If the threads are ok in the nut and on the shaft and you have whatever 
washer belong under the nut, I would try a few drops of locktight blue. Make 
sure you let it set overnight before starting the engine. Is the hole 
through the pulley worn out? If the pulley does not fit snugly around the 
shaft, this may cause the nut to loosen. Is the shaft threaded in the same 
direction as the originel generator? I got a cheapo rebuilt alternator for a 
ford years ago, that was threaded in the wrong direction. this allows the 
rotation of the pulley under tension of the belt to act like a wrench! Have 
you tightened it with a torque wrench to be sure you are getting the nut 
tight enough?

I'm guessing you have thought of at least most of these possibilities, but 
if not, I hope these suggestions help.

Subject: [T2] generator nut backing off


&gt; i am running one of those 'made in germany' pulleys that folks like
&gt; ispwest sell, ad am having a strange issue... which may have nothing
&gt; to do with the pulley, but it hasn't happened before.
&gt; every so often i hear a horrible clanking rattle from the engine bay
