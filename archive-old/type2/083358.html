&gt; =======================&gt;
&gt; I think that is damned good advice !!!
&gt;
&gt; I would ignore the Hell out of that Indy attorney.
&gt;
&gt; They defined the damage fee amount ($ 3K) in order to do a fast cheap trick.
&gt;
&gt; Now then, how much they gonna spend to try and get that $3K ?? - Not much
&gt; in the way of time or out of pocket expenses.
&gt;
&gt; I would stop with the hub cap thing, tell them I have done so via certified
&gt; mail, if it has to come to some kind of communication from me to them, and
&gt; ignore all else.

I don't know about that.  At this point they have no proof (unless they
read this list) that you have even received a letter.  I don't know if I
would acknowledge receiving their communication.  I think that the advice
to do nothing is the best.

Seems that this shyster is hoping to collect a contingency on the off
chance that you will send them some money.  Make it more expensive for
them to get to you and they will probably go away.
