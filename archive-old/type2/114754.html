Subject: Re: [T2] Sound dampening body panels -a link

I have used two sound dampening products, which both seemd to work
well--one being better than the other though.
One being Dyna Mat, which is a sheet of tar like material--you cut it in
pieces to fit the area of application--
The other is Q Pads--which is the better of the two--
It is more flexable--comes in 12x12&quot; sheets and seems to adhere to the
surface better than the Dynamat.

The Dyna mat seems to crack real easy even when heated and it's stressed
to the max getting around interior panel gussets, corner's
-whatever--the Q-Pads are very easy to work with--and do not crack or
break in application.

Either product is available any any finer automotive body shop supply
house.

While browsing the satellite TV newsgroup, I came upon a discussion of
audio/component racks, and found this-for those putting in a stereo in
the van or wishing to dampen panel resonances....
http://tnt-audio_dot_com/clinica/noise.html 
-for a disc. on using tar sheets: 
http://tnt-audio_dot_com/clinica/dampere.html the usual tar mats from a
FLAPS can be used or a product called &quot;Noise Killer&quot; by Rockford
Fosgate- anyone ever hear of this or use it? It is a spray on product. 
RockfordFosgate has a website, and a phone 800-366-2349
