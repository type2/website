&gt; Hi Dave,
&gt; 
&gt; It would seem to me that the interior space of a big rig with a  
&gt; sleeper is pretty close to the interior space of a baywindow or  
&gt; Vanagon. Which is probably why the current line of espar heaters are  
&gt; targeted at the big rigs.
 
 The only difference I can think of is that with a big rig it isn't as  
 hard to find a place to locate the 5HP engine, etc.

&gt; &gt; Sorry guys, sized for a *big* truck, not for busses.
