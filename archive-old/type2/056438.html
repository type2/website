&lt;&lt; I have seen Karl Von Salzen's name dropped quite a few times here the last
 week or two - not to mention his posts of his junkyard finds!
 I myself have been the recipient of Karl's zeal; &gt;&gt;

Roger that.  Karl probably saved me about $500 in hard to find parts.  Great
guy!  (Better watch out, Karl---no good deed goes unpunished.  You'll now be
inundated with desperate pleas for EGR's and '79 crossover pipes).
