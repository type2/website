&gt;    I went to some body shops to see how much it would cost to get the 65's
body
&gt;work and paint done. I told the people that I wanted a showroom quality shine,
&gt;something I can take to shows and bring home trophys with. I went to three
&gt;places, one said it'd take 5-6 weeks and cost between 5 and 6000 bucks. Another
&gt;said a month and a half and cost 6000. The third said she'd be off the road for
&gt;12 - 14 MONTHS and cost 12,000 dollars!  Yes the comma IS in the right place.
&gt;Umm, any thoughts on this? I am definately willing to spend 6 - 8,000 to get
&gt;this done, but 12,000? I don't think so Tim. 
&gt;    Also, anyone have contacts with people who do repairs on pop-tops? Actually
&gt;repair isn't the word, more like rebuild from scratch. The canvas is so old if
&gt;you put light pressure on it your finger goes straight through. Any help is
&gt;greatly appreciated.

        Your figures are about average. My Westy is in the shop at a rate of
$30/hr. He charges me half his normal labor rate because I help his other
customers with their projects This is a shop that does show quality work on
Vettes and street rods, no collision work. Pure heaven!
         Back to the facts-100hrs at $30 + materials=$3600 This includes
media blasting the body, welding in a new nose and some miner prep work. In
all the van body is in solid shape. So the condition of yours might vary allot.
When I painted my sqaureback the material alone cost $700. When you look at
$125/gal for primer, it can add up fast.
        If you want a first class job it can cost, but look for someone that
does body work like this on the norm.
        You can restore the top yourself. Its not that hard. 

Good luck
