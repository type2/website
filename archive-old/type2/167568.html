&gt; Damn! This is frustrating me - I can only imagine what

yeah, wanna bus????
&gt;
&gt; You don't need to check the cht sensor while running.
&gt; It's about 2400 ohms resistance at about room
&gt; temperature. Very wide latitude on the &quot;abouts.&quot; If
&gt; you checked while running you'd be checking voltage
&gt; and I don't know what you'd be looking for - never
&gt; done it that way.

no have only checked while off.  is about 2500ohm if I remember, some
things are running together but it was within spec.

&gt; Anyway, with all the stuff I speculated on, if it
&gt; doesn't fire with starting fluid, it's got other
&gt; problems. Have you actually put your hand over the
&gt; intake - like remove the &quot;S&quot; hose at the TB end
&gt; andwith the throttle wide open, put your hand over it
&gt; and crank the engine to see how much suck it's got

yup done that.

&gt; (even though you're about to thinking it really
&gt; sucks!)

got that right

&gt; it's a really basic thing to check. You have
&gt; numerous times said compression is good. If you're
&gt; like me, you might be saying that because you believe
&gt; it to be true, even though you haven't actually
&gt; checked since the problem... (maybe?)(I realize that
&gt; seems like an insult but not intended to be)

have checked two cyl yesterday,, plan today to go back to start as though
I had just put the engine back in and do the whole start from zeroo drill,
reset valves (these are hyd should have very wide latittiude) etc etc etc.

right now the only insult is this engine.

&gt;  If it has spark and it has fuel(the starter fluid) if
&gt; it has compression and thus vacuum, it's gonna pop at
&gt; ya if the timing is wrong, or it's gonna run if the
&gt; timing is right.

yes , it hasn't even backfired.

&gt;
&gt; By &quot;chugging&quot; I mean that when an engine is so rich
&gt; that it is borderline to being able to run at all, it
&gt; &quot;chugs&quot; like you can hear each individual firing -
&gt; sounds kinda like an old steam locomotive starting

yeah it has sort of done that.

&gt; out. It is always accompanied by black smoke, as in
&gt; smoke-screen density.

no smoke of any color that is easily visible, look real hard with the sun
at the right angle you can see a little black but not much.

&gt; Did you ever figure out how all the gasoline got into
&gt; the exhaust? It would seem that an injector would have
&gt; to be just dumping fuel in continuously to do that. I
&gt; have had a cold start injector stick open.

bad brain held all 4 injectors open.  changed brain it stopped

&gt; Have you tried disabling the fuel pump so you know you
&gt; have zero rail pressure, then try the starter fluid?
&gt; That experiment would indicate whether there is a
&gt; situation wherein it's putting way too much fuel in
&gt; (due to what reason doesn't matter just yet) and if
&gt; that is the case, adding ether will not cause it to
&gt; fire (already too rich) By taking away the injection
&gt; altogether, even removing the white wire from the coil
&gt; (it IS on the same terminal as the wire from the
&gt; points/condensor?) if it still will not fire on start
&gt; fluid, then you have at least apparently eliminated a
&gt; too-rich injection scenario and can concentrate on

good idea, will try that this morning, also plan on removing the coil
resistor block, I have high output coil for the crane ignition, so there
is a resistor block for the coil input but maybe a little more spark might
get it to kick (have pulled the crane off line and am using points)

&gt; compression, vacuum and spark. - BaH

yeah sounds pretty simple oon paper.

thanks for all the help, just having a sounding board is helpful.
