&gt; I just bought an axle nut removal tool from J.C.Whitney. Since I haven't
&gt; heard mention of this tool on the List, I thought I would describe it.
&gt;
&gt; It appears to be a piece of flat forged steel with a dogbone shape to it.
&gt; On one of the ends, it is cut out with a hex shape hole to fit the axle
&gt; nut. On the other end, it is cut out with a square shape to fit a 1/2&quot;
&gt; breaker bar. stamped on the side are the letters EMPI . The tool
&gt; costs $6 + s/h and comes in 36 and 46mm versions.


FYI, I have this tool as well, on my website, in two versions. One is $7.95
and one $14.95. The latter is a more expensive brand, although to be honest
I think even the cheaper one is well up to the task.  Frankly it is probably
the same as the $6 JC Whitney one, but I don't mark up my &quot;shipping and
handling&quot; as much as they do so in the end the cost difference would be
negligable, particularly if you were ordering other parts as well.
