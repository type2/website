I keep reading about how good Bentley manuals are but for the air cooled
Vanagon, I feel it's pretty poor - at least for engine building.  I found
the three Bentley manuals I owned for my past water cooled VW's (Dasher,
GTI, Scirocco) were excellent.  However, the Vanagon manual is covering
air cooled, diesel, and the water boxer motors - perhaps they just
couldn't allot enough space.  I regret paying the big bucks for that
manual - list is approx $100.00, although you can get it for approx
$70.00

For me it the Haynes book along with Wilson rebuild book and an
occasional glimpse into, dare I say it? Muir's complete idiot book. BTW
Muir's book is not really great for a late Type 4 - but then again I'm
referring to my 81 issue, so they really could not have that much
experience with them by then and I believe Muir was dead by then.
Contrary to what you may of heard, I don't believe it was from drugs but
the arrival of hydraulic lifters that really did him in.

John Reynolds  - 81 Westy in search of a name - maybe Muir - Nah!

BTW my spell check suggest vagabond for Vanagon - Is that trying to tell
me something?
