Subject: Re:  Full flow oil filter modification

Michael and the List,

I have modified my engine for a full flow oil filter per the Berg
instructions.  I did not cut a hole in the pulley tin or &quot;drip pan&quot; but
I did dimple it to allow for clearance.  You run the risk of not having
enough material in the case to properly grip the threads on the 90 deg
fitting.  Keep in mind that when you connect your hoses to this fitting
you will be putting some torque on this fitting.  You do not want to
risk cracking the case!  It's been awhile since I have done this, but
there may also be the possibility of blocking the oil passage if you
thread the fitting in too deep.  Don't disregard modifying the tinware.
After all, full flow oil filters are not stock anyway.  Good luck.
