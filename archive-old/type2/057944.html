Happy to... There are probably 100 different takes on making a static
light, but this is the way I learned from the venerable Steve Howell,
formerly of the typeI list, and Seattlite as well...

Items needed:

1 Alligator clip (for 12 or 16 gauge wire), three feet of 12-16 gauge wire
(you can pick the color:), and a small, monofilament light bulb (rear
tailights, dash lights, etc.).  Lastly, you need a soldering iron/gun.  

Strip one end of the wire, wrap it sufficiently around the base of the
light bulb, imitating the threaded portion of a light socket.  Once it's
relatively secure, put a few drops of solder to hold it on.  When cool,
wrap it in electrical tape or some other insulator, but leave the contact
on the bottom of the bulb open, as that is where you will ground it to
determine the exact point to set your dizzy.

Strip the other end of the wire, place it inside the connecting end of the
alligator clip, and place a few drops of solder into the hole.  Or, you
can crimp the end of the clip around the wire.  Soldering is preferred.
Wrap that joint up with e-tape or other insulation, and you have a static
timing light.

And to cover all bases, here's a quickie on static timing, as I learned
it.  Do NOT set the timing unless you have adjusted your points and are
confident that the setting is correct (.016 in, dwell 42-50 degrees).
Otherwise, your timing settings won't be 100% accurate.

Take the dizzy cap off and point the rotor to the notch in the lip of your
dizzy, which will also put you in the vicinity of the notches/degrees on
your pulley wheel that are around #1 cylinder.  With the engine
disengaged, align the specific nothes/degrees on your pulley wheel with
the seam of the case. This alignment depends on your timing
specifications.  If your firing order is 1-4-3-2, than ATDC is on the left
of O (TDC), and BTDC is to the right of O (TDC).  If you don't have a
degree wheel, then the notches might be as follows:  left most notch =
TDC, middle notch = 7 deg. BTDC, and the right most notch = 10 deg BTDC.
However, I would check your manual or check with your mechanic (or the
list) to find out what the exact marks mean for your specific pulley
wheel.  

These are the settings for my 65 sedan.  I hesitate to say that the
notches mean the same thing for all pulley wheels, because timing is
different for many different years.  

Once you feel that you have aligned the case and the exact timing
mark on the pulley wheel, attach the alligator clip end of your new static
light to the negative post on your coil.  This post is also the one where
the green wire attaches from the dizzy.  Loosen the holddown nut on the
dizzy clamp.  Next, turn the ignition switch to the on position, but do
not start the car.  Return back to the engine, and place the light on a
suitable ground, such as the engine block.  NOT the fuel pump or the
carb!!  That is why you have 3 feet of wire:).  If the light comes on,
rotate the dizzy to a point where the light flicks off.  Turn back to
where the light turns on.  And then slowly fine tune it so that you have
the dizzy set to the exact point where the light comes on.  Tighten the
holdown nut, and you have statically timed your engine.  Turn the ignition
switch off, take off your alligator clip, make sure everything is back in
place, and you're on to the next step of your tune up or whatever you're
doing.  

Other listees, please add your .02 if you see anything that needs
correction.  This has worked for me, and I can now time my engine in about
2 minutes.

Good luck.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Tom
