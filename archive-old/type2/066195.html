Subject: Re: Bubble Camper Int. in a Splittie?

Hi Jon etc.

Basically you will find that the cabinets that go directly behind the front seats are _teller_ that the actual bulkhead 
(thre original westy layout is the same height as the bulkhead).

Basically you can prolly jam the interior in but it visually might be less than satisfying

&gt; Has anyone retrofitted a Bubble Window Camper interior (68-79, but I
&gt; have a 71 from James Brill) into an early or late Splittie Bus, or know
&gt; of someone who has?  I'm not concerned about the pop-top stuff, just bed,
&gt; table, rear facing seat etc.  I have either a 66 (wide rear hatch) or a 63
&gt; (narrow rear hatch) splittie bus that could use a decent Camper interior.
&gt; 
&gt; I know the rear cusion is longer and the top of the engine compartment may
&gt; have a heighth variance.  Just curious to get some feedback on this. 8-)
