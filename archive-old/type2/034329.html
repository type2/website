Subject: My vacation and the Coke can (longish)

My first trip report.... woohoo! Well I took a trip down to the Florida Keys
over winter vacation. The night before I set out for the 8 hour drive I did
the last thing anyone should ever do, change something on an otherwise
perfectly working van.  On the advice of the guy at the VWFLAPS I decided to
take out my PCV valve (he said I didn't need one) and put a crankcase filter
on it.  So I did just that, took the pcv valve out of the hose going from
the case to the vacume inlet on the carb and put a hunk of sponge from a
crackcase filter over the hose. I then shoved this into the hole in the
case, taped it up, and set out on my trip.  About 2 miles down the road I
hear a screech/whirl sound coming from the engine. I thought &quot;oh that's just
my alternator belt, I'll adjust it later&quot; and went on my merry way.  So them
about 10 miles down the road the van starts chugging and loosing speed.
Hmmmmm, I pull over and pop the hood. Im in the compartment looking for the
source of the sound. It's not the belt, not the valves, so I pull the hose
from the case. Viola! noise stops. Ok,so the sponge was a bad idea. I pull
the sponge out and shove the hose back in.  The engine starts chugging and
dies. Dammit!! Ok the sponge must have been restricting the vacume. I slap a
pair of vice grips on the hose, just tight enough to put a little resistance
on the line. Engine starts right up and idles smooth as normal.  I slap the
lid on the compartment and continue down highway 27.  Five miles go by and
the engine starts chugging again !_at_$#%!! I pull over, and pop the lid.
Besides the expected oil on the lid I could see nothing wrong. I push the
throttle a couple times and it seems fine.... maybe just a freak occurance.
I put the lid back on and continue. Five miles down the road, same thing. I
notice if I let off the gas and put it in neutral for a few seconds it pulls
itself out of it so I keep going. Ten miles down the road I get really tired
of doing this and I start thinking of what it could be..... AHA! the carb
must be choking from the air in the case shooting into the compartment.  I
pull over again and pop the lid.... as before the engine is running fine
again. So that must be it. So how can I vent the case?? I look through my
box-o-junk and find a piece of vacume hose about 10 inches long... damn,
needs to be longer. Turns out my dad (who has been following me in his fancy
pants Che*y truck and getting quite annoyed at the stop/go) has a length of
hose in his truck about 6 inches long but it is cut in half lengthwise. Ok
so I shove my hose in the case, shove his in mine, and tape up the open part
of the hose. I put a Coke can on the end of the hose and wedge it between
the license plate and the back of the van. I poke a few holes in the can to
allow air to escape and keep oil controlled and it has been like that for
about a week and 1000 miles. So, what does everyone else have in the crack
case breather outlet? The PO had a pcv valve taped in there. Apparently the
valve provides enough resistance to keep the van running but it doesn't do
much for the oil which I fear is not supposed to be going into the
cylinders. Anyway, after that incident i had a wonderful trip. It was the
first time I actually got to camp in the van and use all the stuff I bought
it for. We camped at Bahia Honda state park which was really nice. It is
about 30 miles from Key West on Highway 1. If you ever go there make sure
you get in the sandspur campground.  The ground is sand, not rocks, and
there is much more shade.  I think I counted five other Westy's at the park.
One had big letters on the back that said &quot;NYU herpetelogical society.
Poisonous reptile studies.&quot; Anyone on the list? We did a lot of sailing and
snorkeling in the clear water. I also spent a day in Key West which was very
cool. Toured Earnest Hemingway's house and ate at the infamous Sloppy Joe's.
We went down to the pier at sunset and watched the crowd cheer as the sun
went under the horizon.  All in all it was a great vacation. Mike Green you
out there? I tried to Email you before I went but the address on the AIRS
site gave me a returned Email. Anyway, any ideas about what I should do with
the vacume hose would be appreciated. Thanks,
