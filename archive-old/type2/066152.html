&gt;understand they do this back in the hills of your fair state, care to
&gt;comment?  ;-) The idea of a moonshine car is quite intriging, how about
&gt;some more details? Might be a way around the somg laws too.

(1) moonshine ain't exactly &quot;alcohol&quot;.
(2) it's almost too thick to pour.  unless you get an old timer who likes
    to make &quot;sipping whiskey&quot;, instead of rotgut-for-profit stuff.
(3) i don't think you'd want to be BEHIND one of them cars ... suppose it
    was &quot;polluting&quot; just a bit ... you have a whole string of drunken
    drivers following along!!! :)
