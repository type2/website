Subject: Please answer this question now. This is an urgent matter.

Hello,
I'm using a tow-dolly to pull my '73 westfalia to a
bodyman 20 miles away. The engine is out. The man at
U-Hual told me I'd have to tow her backwards because
it was bad for the transaxle. Would it matter if I
towed her forward? If I towed her backward, would the
steering wheel lock be sufficient, or should I tie the
wheel still or use the club? I appreciate everyone.
                                   -Paul Deatherage
