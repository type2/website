Subject: Re: [T2] Buying Clutch Overhaul Parts Ahead of Time?

&gt; I've got a 71 bus. I'll be pulling the engine to install some missing

&gt; at the same time: it's making more TO bearing noise lately. I was hoping 
&gt; to get the parts here ahead of time, as the bus is a daily driver. But 
&gt; it has been suggested that until the clutch is opened up, one cannot be 
&gt; certain which type of parts will be needed. TO bearing and, I guess, 
&gt; some of the other parts, too. Is there some way to determine the the 
&gt; style of parts used in the clutch prior to opening the patient? Some 
&gt; handy number stamped on the side or something, maybe?

if the clutch is questionable, or making noise. and you have the extra
$100 to spend. just get the clutch kit. comes w/ clutch TO bearing,
and pressure plate. someone can correct me, but as long as it's a 1600
12v engine the flywheel should be the same spacing on the clutch
bolts.
