Subject: Possible Starter Woes?

Hello All -
New problem - and perfect timing since I'm really needing my bus for a
camp/roadtrip.  Scenario: A couple of days ago I drove about 70 miles in
80s-range warm weather.  (Note: The night before leaving, I noticed that
the starter seemed to be laboring a bit in getting the engine started - but
it got it started and I didn't give it much concern.)  Anyway, after the
drive I parked the bus for an errand and when I returned 15 minutes later
and tried to start her, I got nothing.  Idiot lights and other electricals
seemed fine, just nothing when I turned the key.  I've had the &quot;hot-start&quot;
problem once or twice in the past (always unexpectedly and when the bus is
so packed I can't easily get to my toolbox), so I soon got underneath with
a hammer and knocked on the starter a few times.  No luck.  Underneath
again, whacked it some more, and this time the starter fired up.  I didn't
think much more of it; an isolated incident, I thought.  (Note: The starter
still seemed to labor during subsequent successful starts the rest of the
day.)  Cut to lunchtime the following day, and the &quot;hot-start&quot; thing
happened again.  I had to crawl under the damned thing right downtown, and
again it took two sets of whacks to get it going.  By this time I'm having
serious doubts about continuing this roadtrip, and since I wasn't far from
home I decided to get her back home to see what the problem is - as I knew
that not being able to depend on her to start when 100s of miles from home
wouldn't do; I get very nervous about having to leave the engine running
when fueling up, and having to find hills to park on get old real fast. 
Once I arrived back home and turned off the engine, I tried to immediately
start her up again - and got nothing.  So, something's officially amiss
now.  Can anyone offer a diagnosis here - does this sound like an obvious
case of my starter going out, or could this be something else like a
solenoid and/or an electrical problem or something?  I appreciate any
insights anyone can give....thank you!
