Hey now
Questions, questions, questions.
I have just returned from a long day trying to fix a horrendous oil leak.
Okay here are the symptons and no this is not my bus.
Friends have a 79 westy with a recently rebuilt engine in it.
They recently did an oil change in which they put one of those fancy extra
pass oil filters on and after about a week, or less of driving, suddenly oil
began flowing, spraying, spewing if you will over the entire engine
compartment.
They got the bus to a place where it could be worked on and today, after
they had diagnosed the source of the oil, rear seal under the flywheel, we
decided today to pull the engine and make the fix.
After a comedy of errors trying to get the bus up on the ramps, we finally
got the engine out. First of all when the engine and tranny began to
separate, oil began to flow out from between the two, not drip, flow as in
steady stream.
Wow, I've replaced a lot of rear engine seals, and have never had that much
oil from from a blown seal.
Get the two apart and the engine out and first thing we notice is the
pressure place is coated with oil, take it off and the clutch is solid
black.
Oil is pooling in the bell housing of the tranny and oil is still steadily
dripping out of the engine side.
We get the flywheel off and check out theseal and notice it doesn't appear
to be in bad enough shape to justify that much oil.
But what the hey, it's only a couple of bucks and we replace it.
I then notice sitting on one of the shelves on the engine case, a distorted
piece of aluminum, roundish in shape and obviously chewed up.
I then look closer at the case, below the center line of the case are three
round plug-looking places and the mishapen piece of metal has blown out of
one of these.
The three-eighths inch hole is where the quarts of oil were spewing from.
Now for the questions and I apoligize for  the length.
Are these plugs and can they be pressed back in, or is the case shot and we
have to do another rebuild, making the fourth in 18 months.
Could the fancy oil filter cause excess pressure in the engine causing the
plug-like thing to blow out.
If so is it a fluke for air-cooled engine, or are the filters, one safe for
engines and two, worth the money. Hey I haven't bought one yet, but if it
cleans oil better than  the regular one's it would be something I would be
interested in for my oil-dependent engine.
Thanks for your help
Onward thru the fog

Poor planning on his part, does not constitute an emergency on mine
