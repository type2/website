To continue the Dormobile saga I was sitting on the beach today when an
immaculate '72 Dormoble conversion parked up along side my hybrid
conversion....There is a Dormobile Owners Club here in the UK for all makes
covered by Dormobile.  This one was a lovely conversion...gave me some ideas
for next time the jig-saw is out...

Cycling home form work on Friday, 7 miles, I saw 7 Type 2s and 3 Beetles.  I
think this must be becoming a golden triangle for sensible motoring !
