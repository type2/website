Hi,

I just bought my first bus this past weekend, a '78 
Westy Deluxe and also just joined this list.  

I am going to need to recover the front seats, so would 
anyone know a source for the green/brown plaid fabric?  
I am also wondering if there is a place to get the wood 
grain door panels for the slider and the rear hatch, or 
at least the vinyl overlay.

Thanks for any help!
