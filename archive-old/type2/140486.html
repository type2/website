Subject: Re: [T2] new Mexican Longblocks?

the &quot;Mexican&quot; cases are cast in brazil and machined in Mexico. The brazilian
cases have both done in BZ.

There is nothing wrong with either, I personally use BOTH without issue. I
would not use a single relief case, and I would not use aluminum.
