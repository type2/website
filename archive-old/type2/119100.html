Subject: Sliding door handle color?

Looking for a confirmation on the color of the rear door pull handle (#211 843
642a) on the slider for a '78 Westy. Durring the cold snap in the NW a couple
weeks ago I went to close the slider from the inside with the rear handle.
Well it must have become brittle from the cold and snapped off. The question
is, was there a difference in color on these handles? Mine seems to be gray
and most I've seen for sale online are beige. The one on OEVeedub looks to be
the gray color I'm needing but its kind of hard to tell.
http://tinyurl_dot_com/2xtst Has mine just faded to gray over the years?

Thanks-

Jasan C.
