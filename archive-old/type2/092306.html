Subject: Hi

Just wana say Hi, new here but not new to VW.

I had an 87GL and now a 84GL that i partially own with my girfriend
brother.
I just bought a 73 Westy with 1700 or 1800cc (i did not check the heads
# yet!!!) reman engine grom VW Canada???
You can see this one at: http://www.letambourin_dot_com/west73.htm

Well, like you can see am french speaking but i can manage myself in
English.

I did a lot for the Vanagon mailing list server, here is a proof of
that:

I will need some advice later (and i will give some one day), i hope you
will be able to help

Best regards to you guys and girls, Ben from Montreal, Canada
