Subject: RE: [T2] Adding wiring under the bus.

&gt;&gt;I am shortly going to be running some extra wires under my bus from front 
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;back for gauges.
I ran my wires between the seal. Not the best way. BUT I did mount a fuse 
box in the engine compartment. And it is sweet. One wire comes from the 
battery and lets me attach up to 6 connections going out, each with thier 
own fuses. This is a good thing.
