&gt; I would like to  ask a question at the risk of getting
&gt; my head bit off. I never realized how many different
&gt; distributors that VW made. Can anyone tell me the VW
&gt; or Bosh part number for a distributor on a 73
&gt; automatic bus or tell me where I might find it? I
&gt; looked in my Bently manual and it had a list of
&gt; distributors with many, many different part numbers.
&gt; Can any one help me with this? The PO installed a
&gt; distributor that had no vaccuum advance on it.
&gt;
&gt; I have been searching through the archives for an hour
&gt; and a half with no satisfaction. I just bought a box
&gt; of 8 old distributors and I don't know if any of them
&gt; are the one that I need. Any help would be most
&gt; appreciated. i know that this topic is an old one.

If you go here: http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm
and scroll down and click on Bus Auto Trans 1973, you will find 2 sets of
numbers. 021 925 205F [0 231 173 007] or 021 805 205Q [0 231 173 008]. Both
are dual vacuum unit distributors.

But be warned: going by the distributor # marked on the body does not mean
anything. I found a bug at the wrecking yard that had a brand new rebuilt
distributor in it. Looked like it was put in an hour before I got there. It
had a single vacuum advance unit on it. When I got it home and looked up the
number, it was for a 74 bus which has a dual vacuum unit. If the centrifugal
advance inside this dizzy is still for a 74 bus, then it is too much for a
type1 engine. Maybe they put in the guts from a bug dizzy?? I have no idea.
I would need a distributor tester to actually chart the advance curve of it.
The rebuilders part # of the distributor was marked only on the box, which
went back with the core.... What I am saying is: Don't trust the number on
the body of the distributor....it may be wrong!
