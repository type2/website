Subject: RE: Idle problem when cold (2 litre / dual Solex)

The manual says that to start from cold, you should press down
progressively while turning the key....rather than priming the carb, but
they say that if it is bewlow freezing, you can start it in the manner
that you suggest...
However it does seem like you have choke problems, because mine starts
and idles prefectly, and idles considerably faster when the chokes are
set....

Hope this helps

Steve
