Subject: sliding door won't pop open

recently the sliding door ceased to &quot;pop&quot; open - i now have to put my 
fingers in the seam, push the handle down again and pull it all the 
way open. it wasn't a sudden change, but slowly got worse.

i checked the archives, and all i could find were &quot;lube it&quot;  and the 
same instructions for refurbishing found in the library. i did take 
the rear catch assembly off, and NOTHING was broken; just for kicks, 
i did swap out  a 'slider' assembly that looked a little nicer (nylon 
block was barely worn). cleaned, lubed, reassembled... made sure the 
bushing is still aligned with the oil hole in the housing.
no change.
it seems that something - possibly the spring assy in the door? is no 
longer giving quite the kick it used to. i didn't replace the spring 
side yet, as i had a 2-yr-old 'helper' who slowed the procedure until 
dark arrived.

also, i remember reading that the cable/rod assy could be adjusted, 
but i don't see how that affestc the rear mount.

last, could door geometry be a factor? the upper left corner doesn't 
sit as tightly as i'd like......
