Subject: EveryBus Blues :-(

Hi listees,
   Hope you don't mind, I just need to vent.
I'm sitting here behind this computer, on a break at work, instead of 
wandering around fields full of buses and best of all, bus owners.  I had 
planned to make the trip south this year, as I had in 2000, for EveryBus but 
couldn't get the time off from work.
   To console myself, I had decided to do some local camping on Saturday 
night at a county park.  I sent out e-mail to our local bus club (Long 
Island Bus Alliance) that I would be camping and invited them to join me.  
Even though noone responded I had hopes of finding a few buses at the 
campground this evening when I get there.  From where I'm sitting I can see 
out the hangar doors and the sky is gray and overcast and there is a lite 
rain coming down.  Earlier it was pouring for a couple of hours.  I guess 
I'll be lucky if any one but me and my wife Kathy show up at the campground.
   Well thanks for listening, and have a good weekend.
