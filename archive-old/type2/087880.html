Subject: Re: [T2] I need a set of 2L engine tin, High Country



Did you ever find a set of tin?
I laid out ALL the pieces needed for a 75-78 2.0. Counting the heater flap
valve pipes, the two plates to seal the heater boxes-to-fan housing, and the
muffler heat shield; the total is 22 pieces!
Here is a pic of all the pieces:

[yes, I have the full set as pictured]

You mentioned putting the 2.0L into a 74. Does this mean you are using the
72-74 style heater boxes?
If yes, then a 2.0L complete tin set will NOT work. You will need to replace 6
pieces with 1700-1800 pieces:
the front lower tin, L + R,
the lower pushrod cover tin, L + R,
the heater valve pipes, L + R,
[and the alternator adjuster/exhaust support is also different]


&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; I need a set of 2L bus engine tin. I have a 914 motor
&gt; which has about half of its engine tin but I need a
&gt; complete set of 2L Bus engine tin so I can fit this
&gt; engine in my 74 bus. I will be at High Country Bus
&gt; Festville this year and can pick it up there. If you
&gt; have a set to sell and won't be going to High Country,
&gt; then that would be great too. Just let me know what
&gt; the shipping will be. Thanks so much!
&gt;
&gt; My address is
&gt;
&gt; David Kelly
&gt; 213 ILEX Drive
&gt; Wilmington, NC 28412
&gt;
&gt; If you have a set to sell, let me know. Thanks!!!!
