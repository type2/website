&lt;&lt; Anthony,

Shield from rust---???

Please elaborate on what this item is--
 &gt;&gt;

Let's try again...What I said was that I found 
surface rust under the twenty some year
old undercoating. The old undercoating
had become very hard and difficult to
remove...What I was afraid of was that
the old undercoating was no longer 
shielding or protecting the metal from
rusting, but was just hiding any rust 
that was forming under it...
No POR's were alluded to or harmed... ;-(
