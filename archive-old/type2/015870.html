First, thanks to all who have responded with comments about the FI to carb
conversion question I had. Haven't decided what to do yet, but you all have
given me grist for the mill.

Although it's a little early for off-bus conversation (it's still 23
minutes until Friday, local), I'm going to post this, and then go to bed.

This last week, I lost a friend whom I never met. Shel Silverstein died
this last weekend in his apartment. He was 66. 

Now, I have no idea if he ever drove a Type II or not, but I'd like to
think that he did. 
Certainly his philosophy (I'm thinking particularly of &quot;The Missing Piece&quot;)
would 
entitle him to do so. I hope you all take a minute to grab a copy of one of
his book
out of the hands of a child (gently, though -- the little buggers bite!)
and get to know Uncle Shel. I, for one, will miss him.

Thanks again to the list for the help.
Regards,

&quot;Fraser, there's a guy on my corner who asks me every morning if I've
seen God; do you really think he expects me to point Him out?&quot;
&quot;Well you know, Ray, if you did, perhaps he'd stop asking.&quot;
