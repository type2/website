&gt; Everybody that might be intrerested there is a campout, &quot;The DAM campout in 
&gt; the Ozarks&quot; 4/28 to 4/30 at the lazy K campground.  The campground is below 
&gt; the Ozark Dam. I think it might be conceder Eldon, Mo.  I got this info from 
&gt; a flyer, anybody going?  I think Stephen White might know a little about it, 
&gt; are you out there Steve White?
Yep, its near eldon MO...

the campground is very near to the bagnell dam... the easiest way to get
there is take either Highway 70 or highway 44 (whichever is more
convenient) to highway 54 south.  take highway 54 through eldon MO and the
campground will be easy to find once you get near the dam. (or so im told
this will be my first time at this campout..)

a website with some info:

and the website for the campground:

&gt; Also in St. Louis, The Gateway Volkwagen Club &amp; Southland Volkwagen is have 
&gt; the 7th annual Show and swap meet, 4/30 8am to 5pm at Suntrup Southland (i 
&gt; think it is a vw carlot. I-55 north to lindbergh, North 1 mile on lindbergh. 

well, it is north on 55 from 270/255.... but if you are coming from
downtown saint louis/illinois it would be 55 south from that direction.
Lindbergh is just one or two exits away from 270/255.  If you pass this
highway coming from downtown you have gone too far.

This show is about 3 hours away from the campout, but several people that
are attending the campout will be caravaninng to this show early sunday
morning.  This would be an excellent plan for anyone who has to head
out 44 or 70 to get home... if you are going east, it would be on your
way, if you have to head home to the west, it would add about 1-2 hours to
your driving... (not counting the drive from the campground to the show)

try http://www.mapquest_dot_com to see how it all pans out for you...

take care and see you there,

Steve
