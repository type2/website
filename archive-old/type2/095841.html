Subject: RE: [VB] sundial musings

Hi Chuck,
I always thought that the Sundial factory was in Riverside, CA.  Also, I've
seen a 1964 Sundial from the factory, and I think there were even earlier
ones made than that.  There are people on this list WAYYYYY more
knowledgeable about this stuff, but I'm sure that Sundials were mfg in
California.

Ed
