Subject: TDC &amp; BRAKES

Hello Folks.

Was going to do my first valve set on my bus. I read two manuals and had one question before I try it. I know you line up the rotor on the notch on the distributor for TDC position #1. I remember that on a bug engine that the notch on the fly wheel also lined up with a block seem I think. But with mine (pancake 1700) do the notches on the fly wheel line up with anything? Or do I simply trust the alignment of the rotor. I would run out and look again (but my bus is 20 miles away in a friends garage).

Also when I replace my front brakes, calipers and pads, do I also have to bleed the rear brakes as well? (I got this feeling that the bleeder valves on the rear will be frozen).

One more thing..I dont use my heat at all. Is it really important to have those two small pieces of tin on both sides that screw to the block and on the bottom of the heat exchangers..the ones that cover/block acess to the push rod tubes from the bottom..I have all the compartment seals and everything is good but those pieces are about to fall off and I dont know if they are that major in cooling the engine...besides a TINY oil leak on one push rod tube lets iol flow onto the hot exchanger=smoke! (I promise to fix the leak but can I just remove the cover for now?

I know lots O' questions...but I am ready to take my own repair &quot;to the next level&quot; and am SO glad to have &quot;the list&quot;

Peace
Andrew
