Subject: weber carb floats

Hi poeple,
I took the weber 2brl progressive carb off my camper and to a mechanic
to rebuild who is having a problem finding new floats. As it is not the
original daul carbs my books offer him no help. Does anybody have info
on Weber 2brl progessive  carbs, I understand they were a very popular
replacement, I've seen a few on other busses. Anyway here are the
numbers off of mine    32//36DFAV ,  23A  3K/7 .    Thanks for being
outthere, Mike 73 Westy
