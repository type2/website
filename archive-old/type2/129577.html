&gt; With all the Bosch Jetronics of the 1970s and early 80s, the way to go

&gt; turn to the off position. Then back to start and let it crank. I was 
&gt; taught this for Volvos -- the notion is that it &quot;charges up&quot; the fuel 
&gt; ring -- and it works equally well with my bus (although the VW 
&gt; starting circuit requires turning the key to the off position before 
&gt; going back to start).

I have found that starting is easier this way, too.  I find that on a 
cold morning, if I crank for a few seconds and it almost catches, I 
turn the key off, crank it again, and it starts immediately.

I never touch the accelerator pedal when starting ... totally not 
necessary on FI.
