Subject: Timing Question...009 distributor

Hi there,
 I'm trying to find out the optimum number of degrees before/after TDC that
my engine should be timed. I've a '74 1800 bus with a Bosch 009 distributor
(#0 231 178 009) which has no vacuum advance (so I assume it is a
mechanical/centrifugal advance system, n'est ce pas?) and at 850rpm the
timing light reads about 17 degrees ATDC. This is off my timing scale but
as the dizzy is not a stock one I'm wondering if this is the norm. The
engine block has just been rebuilt with new cylinder heads, pistons etc.
Any help would be much appreciated, as I'm doing the timing thing for the
first time.
