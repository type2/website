Subject: Wheel Alignment - 78 camper

Not critical, but the rear wheels of the camper kick out at the bottom, and
the front wheels are pinched in at the bottom.  Plus a little too much
toe-out, which I will take care of today.

I took it in to the VW dealer, for a 4 wheel alignment, with the
understanding that I wanted all four wheel to be straight, and the toe to be
corrected, and the streering wheel centered.

I got it back, looking exactly like it was when it went in, but with a
computer printout showing that everything was NOW in spec.  No computer
printout that said what it was when it went in!!

Took it to Virginia Alignment, top people in the area.  they said it was not
a simple alignment, but needs to go to a frame shop!!

Took it to a close friend from the church, where I get all my body work
done.  (His house is 2X bigger than mine, with a circular stairway to the
second floor - not a simple body shop!!)

He explained that to fix it corectly, it would take much money.  For a
quickie, he had his Korean old man do a Korean pull on the whels to bring
them straigt-ish.  After I got it back (no charge) it looked very
acceptable.  Happy, Joy, Good feeling.  

Recently, while trying to get Port-a-Walls installed at NTW, discovered the
right wheel rim is not straight - BENT slightly!!

OK - what parts must I replace to get the rear wheels STRAIGHT UP and DOWN,
and what must I adjust to get the front wheels STRAIGHT UP and DOWN?

(Oh- NTW could not get the Port-a-Walls [from Lucas in CA] on the wheel.
Anybody know of Northern VA tire/wheel shop with some talented people!!)

Thanks - Barry Burneskis sends
