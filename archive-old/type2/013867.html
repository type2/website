Subject: Re: [T2] Generator Light

The generator light is connected directly to the battery positive when the
key is on.  If the generator isn't putting out any voltage, the difference
between the battery and generator causes the bulb to light.

If you're running an alternator, the current through the light supposedly
is used to start the alternator working, but I don't know the particulars
on this.
