Hey now you Florida people, anyone interested in getting together this Sat. 
afternoon for a cruise and a beer( in that order) . Meet in Lakeland at Lake 
Hollingsworth at 2_at_pm at the boat ramp. Were gonna cruise around a few of the 
local lakes( get stared at by the recent influx of bluehairs), and then 
sample some beer at the local irish pub!  Please feel free to email me if you 
have any ?'s. Hope to see ya there!
