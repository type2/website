&gt; I'm looking at a 75 owner's manual here that states that

&gt; So I think limiting to 65 is too conservative. I easily maintain 75 in
&gt; my '72 which has a '79 2.0 and weber progressive. 80 and 85 bursts
&gt; have been done too on brief passing situations.

Right, but a weber progressive isn't FI, is it? I was thinking not so 
much about what you can squeeze out of a VW engine on any given day, 
but rather what sustained speeds over 55 mph in FI buses will do to 
your engine long-term (which is, I suspect, to shorten it 
considerably).
