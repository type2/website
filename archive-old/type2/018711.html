I'm parting out a '72 passenger bus.  I'll be using a few things for my
'74 westy like engine, tranny and a few other odds and ends.  Everything
else must go.  The interior is fantastic, the middle seat is intact
(minus mounting brackets), no rips in the upolstery, the seat padding is
not even crushed.  
	The bus is located in Orrville, Ohio (1 hour south of Cleveland) I can
arange delivery of parts to the surrounding area and to the Pittsburgh
area if need be.  
	I'll be at the German Jubilee this Sunday in Columbiana, Ohio.  The bus
won't be there, but I'll have some pixs of it with me.  If your
interested stop by and see me, I'll be showing my green '65 ghia.
	I really need to sell everything i don't use.  Other wise it will be
crushed.  I can cut sheet metal to you specs. Let me know what you need
and we'll go from there.  I can sell the title and all coresponding
Vin's if needed.

Later,
