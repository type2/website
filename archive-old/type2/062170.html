&gt; OK...maybe a little on the black side.  So any one know what caused this to

&gt; I noticed that there were a lot of loose and broken hoses and vacuum lines in

&gt; pistons and heads

&gt; Anyone have any Ideas or have you seen this before????    John Jensen in

At a first guess, it sounds like detonation. If there are vaccuum leaks, 
this may have caused an excessive amount of air to enter. A lean mixture 
can cause these symptoms, as well as running too low an octane of fuel, 
timing advanced too far, etc.

This is assuming, of course, that it's not just corrosion. I have seen a 
couple engines left in the weather. Water standing on the heads caused 
them to pit. If this were the case, you'd probably see water in the oil 
and other signs of corrosion.
