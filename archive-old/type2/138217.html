Subject: Re: [T2] Power Windows (talk about LUXURY!)

A/C = Must have for Anton, the sweaty guy.

Power WIndows = I can live without!!!

That's just TOO high-tech for me!

Now if only I can find someone to show me how to put an OEM sunroof on
our new camper!

Speaking of which, we just got our OEM VW &quot;Station Wagon&quot; brochure for
1969. Interestingly enough, the VW literature consistently refers to
the bus as a &quot;station wagon.&quot; Neat little brochure.._dot_complete with
Factory colours and all.

We found it on eBay, naturally!

Tomorrow is our big trip to North Carolina to pick our new &quot;Karma&quot; up.
290 miles each way, but coming straight from the VW guru's shop in
Winston-Salem.

AIRS list is printed out. Cell phones are charged. Metric Tools packed.

No need for A/C since the high tomorrow looks to be only 300 F or so.

Brrrrr...
