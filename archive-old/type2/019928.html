&gt; I recently ordered one of the battery relays from Bus Depot, this past
&gt; weekend at Oktoberbus I was able to hook it up (with the help of Dave
&gt; Jersey and Snoopy).  As best I can tell, it works as advertised.
&gt; However, I now realize it does not do exactly what I had in mind.
&gt; You might
&gt; have a dedicated camping light, fan, or 12v access. outlet hooked to it,
&gt; but these items should not be used while the engine is running.

When the engine is running, the relay ties the AUX battery into the vehicle's
charging system and in effect a second storage battery wired in parallel to
the primary battery.  Anything running off of either battery is in effect
running off of both .  The concern would be if rou were running so much
electrical equipment, the alternator could not keep up.  The AUX battery is
only isolated when the engine is shut off and the alternator is not producing
current.

&gt;   I don't necessarily need the
&gt; ability to select which one, using the aux battery only while camping
&gt; would be fine, leaving the main battery ready for engine cranking.

Which is what it is designed to do.

&gt; I want to be able to use the bus stereo (not there yet) and interior
&gt; lights while camping without running down the starting battery.
&gt; Creating a second electrical system off the aux battery, which wouldn't
&gt; allow the use of anything wired into it while underway.

Hope I explaned this.  You can use any thing from any battery while underway.

&gt; My thinking is that this would allow me to simply substitute the power
&gt; source for the fuse panel and thus the wiring for the interior lights
&gt; and stereo, allowing their use both while driving and camping.  Am I
&gt; (horribly and tragically) wrong?  Enlighten me o denizens of the list.

A maually switched power switch to connect the batteries could be used in
place of the isolator relay.  That is the simplist way. A single on - off
switch to connect or interrupt the positive lead between the two batteries.
On when engine is running and every thing works.  Off when stopped, and only
those electrical components connected to the AUX battery function with no
drain on the Primary battery.  That is what the isolator relay does.  I
bought a bus once, and the PO had used a knife switch to accomplish this
function.  Worked really good, and I never burned out a relay.

Don't get me wrong, it just appears there is no problem in conflict with what
you want to achieve.
