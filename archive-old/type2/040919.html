Subject: Re: fuel tank needed

 putting stuff in the gas tank is a little sketchy from what ive heard, i
did the gravel from my driveway procedure, with an extended hose rinse , let
it dry, rinsed it with some gas and cleaned the screen, and everything is
fine, the important thing is to put a couple of filters in the line,
especially one before the fuel pump( if you have one) and lots of clamps,
this will get you by to the next engine pull and maybe more
jb/alabama

&gt; I'm not sure where to get a new/rebuilt tank, but I saw an article in one
of
&gt; the VW mags that described a rust-removal procedure which may help you.
&gt;
&gt; Get some sharp-edged gravel (a couple of pounds should do it), pour it in
&gt; the tank and shake the heck out of it for a long time--a couple hours of
&gt; shake for five minutes/rest for ten should do it. The tank restored in the
&gt; article was out of a Bug, so the Bus tank may need two people to shake it.
&gt; This shaking with gravel knocks the big rust chunks off the metal.
&gt;
&gt; Then get some tank cleaner (the Bentley manual lists a couple of tank
&gt; cleaners, and POR-15 sells one), block off both outlets, and clean the
tank
&gt; with this stuff.
&gt;
&gt; Go to a gun shop and buy a pistol cleaning kit. In it is a little wire
brush
&gt; on the end of a metal rod. Use this to clean the outlets.
&gt;
&gt; Then paint the tank with POR-15's gas tank paint inside and just regular
&gt; rattle can paint on the outside, then reinstall the tank.
