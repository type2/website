 &gt; It all boils down to quoting old messages in their full extent ! It's just a

A filter exists that looks for the &quot;TO LEAVE THE LIST&quot; bit at the bottom of the messages--the logic was that if that line were included in a submitted message, it obviously hadn't been edited properly, so reject it. It was a highly effective filter but I turned it off long ago because of the large number of people who complained when their messages were bounced by it. The admins only have time to deal with so much crap. Any of them can turn it back on anytime they want, though.
