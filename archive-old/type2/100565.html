Subject: BA6 question recirculating air?

Could you skip over the recirculation fan on a BA6 setup if you wanted? 
There is a fan sorta built into the unit itself, but does it propel the air 
enough on its own, or do you need the recirculation fan as well, both to aid 
in the heating process as well as to help push the hot air into the van?

thanks!
