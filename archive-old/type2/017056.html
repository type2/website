Subject: VW Locally made tools book.

Every once in a while I post a plea to anyone holding a copy of the
'Locally made tools' book published by VW for their dealers.

I have yet to get my hands on one or even get info on some of
the contents.

Soooooooooo. Does anyone have access to this publication?

Would you be prepared to copy it for me? (All costs covered!)

Would you be prepared to publish on the web?

Am I banging my head against a brick wall?

Fame and fortune awaits the first to go public...........

Simon
