When I installed my interior (all wood, custom cut by yours truly), I went
to the local Chase Pitkin and found some R12 (?) insulation.  It looked
like styrofoam, was maybe 0.5-0.75&quot; thick, and had a shiny foil back.  I
just stuck that stuff in with duct tape before I installed the back panels.
 It may have helped slightly with heat insulation (I don't drive her in the
winter, I abuse a H20 VW for that!), but it sure did cut down on road
noise!  And as far as heat goes, I used a little camp stove to &quot;preheat&quot; my
Bus when I went camping a week or two ago.  Temps weren't great, but it was
at least comfortable.  I don't recommend this as a safe idea, but check
around and see what kind of butane/propane or propane heaters with safety
devices might be available.  Ideally, an installed propane or gas heater
would be your best bet for preheating - crank it on, let it thunder for a
minute or two, and you're toasty warm......

&gt; But what about preheating for all the non-westies?  I don't have any 
&gt; electricity anywhere near my bus (college parking lot, no coverage or 
&gt; anything) although I'm thinking about renting a garage down the street 
&gt; for the winter months.  How are we supposed to preheat?  I'm really 
&gt; getting excited about being able to feel my extremities during the 
&gt; winter driving season!
