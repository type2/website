Subject: Nose job revisited + help me pull engine!
Message-ID: &lt;619b93ac.24b29073_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Got Lurch ('71 Westy) back from Wade's Body Shop the other day.  It's not 
finished yet -- someone put a scratch on it trying to put on a headlight trim 
ring, but boy does it look good.  You may recall, I found a complete 
nosepiece for $35 and had the body shop put it on from top to bottom and all 
the way back to the floorboard -- plus a new windshield and new rubber 
(including the doors -- outside window scapers, etc.).  Had to have it for 
the July 4th campout.  DocRic was having trouble getting Babcia ('69 Westy) 
to start.  He tried everything.  I suggested connecting the battery to the 
hot side of the coil.  It started right up, but the horn stayed on.  He wound 
up driving up in a Ch#vy  S_at_f_at_r1.  We were both upset.  A splendid time was 
had by all.  Those that stayed overnight (camping only) were treated to 
dynamite omelets prepared by DocRic and myself.

I can't say enough good about Wade's Body Shop.  Although it has taken longer 
to get the job done, the job was done RIGHT!  He will be finishing the 
restoration when I have the financial wherewithal to do so.  Will probably go 
panel by panel, replacing rust with new metal.

Thanks to those on the list that provided advice for quick fixes (i.e., kick 
it back out, put a bra on it, etc.) a couple of hundred posts ago.  Now, I 
need to pull the engine to replace the main seal and remove the tranny for 
repair.  Can I call on the good graces of the local contingent to help?  
Beers for all who show.  It's an all day job for one, but two or more can do 
it in a few hours  As always, thanks in advance.
