Subject: Question about timing marks on '69 Westy

I went to adjust the valves on my '69 Westy the other day, and got myself confused a bit (weird
since I've been working on this Bus for 10+ years and didn't notice this).  The engine is a stock
1600sp, stock single vacuum advance distributor (113 905 205 T), with a replacement Brosol H30/31
carb.

I turned the crankshaft pulley to align the v notch with the crankcase parting line, and for the
first time, noticed the divot in the front part of the pulley (see picture).

I had always assumed that the v notch was TDC, and that's where I should set my valves and timing
to.  But on the '72 Super Beetle I had, the the v notch wasn't TDC, the divot in the front of the
pulley was.  I did the pencil test on #1 to figure out where TDC was truly at, and it seemed to
like up with the divot.  Have I been tuning my engine wrong all this time???

I compared the pulley off the engine to one I pulled off of a scrap engine (B case), and the divot
lined up with the v notch furthest to the left, which I believe to be TDC (see picture again). 
This is probably the correct crankshaft pulley for my '69 Westy engine...

Have I been wrong all this time?  

I adjusted my valves and timing to line up with the divot, but it seemed to make the engine run
hot, or at least hotter than it ran using the v notch (looks like 7.5 BTDC), so it looks like I
have some other work to do.
