Subject: Attention Calif-Emissions Aircooled Vanagon Owners! 

If you have an aircooled Vanagon with the California-only exhaust setup, you
may be interested to know that I just obtained some of the elusive left-side
California-only heat exchangers. These were $400 when last available, and
haven't been made for years.  The price is $139 each.  If you're using this
setup, you should definitely stock up, as they will probably never be
available again at any price, much less 65% off.
