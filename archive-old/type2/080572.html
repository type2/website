Is this kit from VW or aftermarket?

I've seen kits which add to the existing rear scoops to allow
MORE cooling air in.  (You are headed in the opposite direction)
One of my neighbors added these rear scoops to his white '69 Westy.
The add on air scoops are painted black, and his bus looks like
it's wearing a set of Mickey Mouse ears.  :)

&gt; cut down the amount of cold air hitting the engine allowing the engine to get

&gt;  Does it really work this way?  Any info appreciated!  Thanks for your help.

Driving from SLC to L.A. in the winter, I stopped for hot coffee in
Heber City, UT.  I spilled a little coffee on the dashboard of my bus.
Before I could get a napkin to wipe up the spill, it froze to the
dash!  To get the engine warmed up (no stock thermostat, shame on
me) I used duct tape to close off all but the upper and lower slot
in the stock air scoops.  Engine ran fine for temps in the 20F range.
Once I got to Beaver, it had warmed up a bit and the snow on I-15
melted away, so I removed the duct tape.  

Yes, in my limited experience, it did work.

Good luck,
