Subject: Power box seal

Greetings,

I am looking for a new seal for the external plug in unit box thing for my 
78 westfalia. The old one is kind of foam in nature. Anyone know where I can 
get a new one? I didn't see one at Gowesty. The seal has 3 screwholes at top 
and one at the bottom.

This is the box with the delta six industries sticker on it. Anyone know 
where to get a new sticker? One not in the $17 Gowesty? camper sticker set.

Or what could a new seal be made out of?

Thanks,
Brandt
