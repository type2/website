Subject: Re: [T2] uggh. cv boots. again!

I bought the german boot kits from my local vw store, that come with boots,
bolts (no washers or plates) and the clamps - however those metal clamps
will rip your boots - they do not allow the boot to move at all once they
are installed. i.e. especially if the boot is initially positioned to far
towards the opposite end of the axle (towards the other cv) thus putting
extra strain on the rubber - and possibly when the axle is traveling to its
extent - lifting high or extra low (bumps or jumps :) the boot will tear.

I have always just used a zip tie - snug - but not killer tight and never
had a broken boot - nor had it leak.

good luck!

&gt; Like a moron I allowed the CV to come apart.  It was fun.  Now the inner
&gt; boot on the passenger side is torn.  Is it common for 3 of 4 boots to
&gt; fail in 2 to 6 months?  Should I replace the other one that was replaced
&gt; in August while I'm at it?  I don't really have the option of not
&gt; driving it to work tomorrow.  Knowing what a job it was last time it may
&gt; have to wait until the weekend.  The tear is on top, so there's little
&gt; change something will fly up in through the tear.  The grease is all
&gt; over the place.  The starter looks real pretty.  So replace them both
&gt; knowing how new they all were or just the torn one?  Can bad things
&gt; happen driving it for a week like that?
