Subject: Re: Docs Auto: Good?  Bad?

From: Jonathan Cunningham &lt;dawfun_at_dawfun_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Have any of you out there had any experiences with Docs Auto
&gt;(http://www.docsauto_dot_com/)?  I'd be interested to learn your thoughts on
&gt;the quality of their work.

Thinking of farming out some work cross-continent? :-)  I've never had repairs done at Doc's, but I've met him and have found him off-putting.  
Arrogance and hustling aren't entirely incompatible with competence and fairness, but the overlap isn't large.

If you want to read more direct experiences and commentary, get thee to the Tallahassee Vintage VWs yahoogroup, sign up, and search for him in 
the message archives:

http://autos.groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/tv2/

He does have at least one very competent guy working with him (JB Ritter), but I have yet to hear someone speak highly of their experience with the 
shop.
