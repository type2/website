Somone was looking for a hightop but I cant find the orig message.

Seen on South Beach
1970 Hightop Camper
305-317-0588

I couldnt figure the make,has long narrow windows on sides of top, top
covers complete roof with a lower section in back (there is an AC unit up
there) middle windows are similar looking to westy windows but have only 2
panes.
Chalky white paint but seemed at a glance to be in fair shape. Not much rust
evident on the outside no dents. Looked inside saw some decent looking
camper interior bits. Lots of Dead Stickers.
