Subject: Looking for a 71/72 Front Rotor

Hi everyone,

I'm new to the list, and new to VWs.  I just picked up a '71 Camper
for $100 down in Maryland (I'm from Northeastern PA), and its really
great.  Rebuilt motor, just a pretty good rust bucket.  Its really
complete except for missing the poptop canvas, and missing one brake
rotor.  Its set to drive home as soon as I track down a rotor, and I'd
like to possibly locate a used rotor from someone that I could get for
cheap before investing a bunch of money into the new rotors for the
front.  So if anyone in Eastern PA or Northern Maryland (I-81 / I-83 /
I-270) area might have a spare one lying around, I'm pretty interested
in picking it up ASAP and getting this thing home.

Thanks!

-Mark
