Subject: RE: [T2] OG 1600 DP Engine

I would rebuild it. Give it all new bearings and seals - and maybe a new top
end (pistons/cylinders/heads) along with things like a new oil cooler. Check
to see if rods and such are still in spec - I bet they will be.

If the vacuum can still works on the dizzy I would run it, if its shot then
maybe move to a SVDA.

Keep in mind though if you get a new engine, there are things you are going to
need from the original one -especially the manifold as it has the correct port
for the disk brakes.

-Daniel

PS - got the seat covers today - thanks!!!!!!&gt; Got a 71 Westy with original
1600 DP Engine with 68k miles on it. &gt; 1.) Store and build a new one&gt; 2.) Pull
the engine and rebuild it ( keeping all the good parts)
