Yep, it's really that simple.  Just use thick wire (2 gauge is good) and
make sure it is routed where it absolutely cannot be pinched or melted.  I
have two extra batteries in the spot on the left but will be moving them
inside the camper soon so I can install a gas heater in that spot.
Priorities, ya know.  :)
