Subject: Re: [T2] Finished installing my radio-dynamat

JC whitney has a product absolutely identical to dynamat, only difference is it
doesn't say dynamat on it and it is half the price. i hope this will save a few
of you some cash.

&gt;
&gt; While I had the doors apart I put 4 sq ft of Dynamat in each, not cheap but
&gt; I couldn't find anything similar that would have the same effect.  Before,
&gt; the doors used to go 'clangggg', now they go 'thunk'.
