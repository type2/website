Subject: Thanks_Westy tent page URL?

Jaime thanks for the prompt reply.

I did check out Joe Clark's westy tent page from your site
the picture in http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/1101/westy2.jpg
It is exactly my new tent and is slightly different from the one in my 
brochure from 1969. The wind is blowing slightly stronger. But it is the same 
white bus on the same beach.
Does anyone want me to scan my westy catalog and put it up on my pages
