&gt;I don?t follow how forward and backward movement is stopped by a line bore?

Crankshaft movement is established by the # 1 main bearing.
Axial movement of the crank is determined by the flywheel and shim pack.
Line-boring restores worn crankshaft bearing rotational clearances, while the
thrust cut restores the thrust surface in the case.
