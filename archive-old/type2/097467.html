Robert, I assume this is referring to the distributor drive shaft gear 
thingy that is under the distributor.  At the bottom of it, it mates to the 
drive gear on the crankshaft.  On the top, it mates to the bottom of the 
distributor.  It's just a little shaft that joins the distributor to the 
crankshaft.  You will not have to split the case to install this, only put 
the engine at #1 tdc to get the orientation correct.  for more info, refer 
to bentley.  Greg
