Subject: Re: [T2] Digital calipers

&gt; &gt;Personally I have found the &quot;get what you pay for&quot; rule to be often untrue.
&gt; &gt;I have many expensive things that are very unsatisfactory (poor values) and
&gt; &gt;quite a few inexpensive things that I value much more than what I paid for
&gt; &gt;them.

And don't forget that sometimes the technology comes along that makes what 
was once an expensive precision tool a cheap piece of engineering. There 
was a time when a digital tachometer cost hundreds of dollars. Same thing 
with digital calipers. The technology has reached a point where the 
measuring electronics are a fraction of the cost of the materials to make 
one. So, you can make it out of the finest stainless that never wears and 
spend hundreds. Or out of plain steel and pay tens of dollars. One will 
wear out faster than the other, measured in years, but they will usually 
measure the same accuracy out of the box. Use it every day on a shop floor 
and the $20 one won't last a year, but for me, I use one every 2-3 months 
so the $20 one will last 10 years. But they may very well have the same 
&quot;guts&quot;.

Another example: Have you noticed that every coffee maker from every 
manufacturer that has a digital clock and automatic start has the same 
buttons and the same programming? They have the same chip in them. $20 or 
$200, they have the same chip. Some guy in Taiwan makes them by the boxcar 
load and sells them to everyone.

Now, if they guys that make exhaust sensors or fuel injection systems could 
just standardize as well, we would be in like Flynn.
