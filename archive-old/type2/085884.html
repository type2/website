Subject: Painting a Westy Roof, etc.

There's been some discussion regarding painting a Westy roof, so I =
thought I'd kick in my recent experiences.  My bus had been parked under =
an apple tree for 2 years when I got it, so by the time it became mine, =
the roof had developed a very nice fuzzy texture.  Additionally, the =
metal roof underneath it was fairly rusty too, so I figured I'd address =
both problems at the same time.

I'm a big fan of Simple Green, so after removing the pop top, I set it =
in the backyard and liberally doused it with simple green and let it sit =
for a half hour.  I then tore into it with a scrub brush and a hose, and =
then repeated the process once again.  After all that work the roof =
still wasn't white, but it was better.  Unfortunately one of the POs had =
painted the roof with latex house paint which was by now really peeling. =
 I let the whole thing dry out for a few days, and then hit it with the =
random orbit sander and some 180 grit.  It was a lot smoother at this =
point but still not as white as I was hoping for.  I picked up a quart =
can of Rustoleum Professional Enamel (this is not spray paint, see =
http://www.rustoleum_dot_com/category.asp?SubCatID=3D26&amp;MainCatID=3D3).  I =
put two coats on and am quite pleased with the results.  This is THICK =
paint, and it dries to a very hard, super glossy surface.  There are a =
few drips because the paint went on so thick (I'd recommend thinning it =
just a little) but it easily passes the 10 feet rule.

I was so impressed, that I decided to use this on the inside and the =
rusty roof as well.  I used their Rusty Metal primer =
(http://www.rustoleum_dot_com/category.asp?SubCatID=3D53&amp;MainCatID=3D1) =
which is fish oil based.  It's too soon to tell how this will hold up, =
but I'll let you know in a few months.  I'm again really impressed with =
the overall quality of the coverage and finish of the Professional =
Enamel.  I painted almost the entire floor of the bus, and while the =
color match isn't perfect, it still looks 100% better than it did =
before.  The paint has stood up to a few weeks of my muddy shoes walking =
around inside the bus while I worked on other things so I'm optimistic =
that it will stand up to the long haul.
