Subject: synergism in water-injection development

	Since it may be a while till my
campmobile is running again, I thought I could
let youse have this bull on a slightly different
approach to water-injection.  I suspect some of
youse may play with two-wheelers as well, like
me, so you may as well use them as mobile
test-beds.  And anyhow, a humble air-cooled
sickle itself deserves protection from seizing
...

	My contention is that VW owners who also
ride motorcycles can improve both vehicles by a
largish water jet in the intake manifold, just
after the carb.  Venturi injection works well,
but here's my bull that just inside the carb may
be as good.
	The Brazilian Weber on my VW 1600 motor
has a vac nozzle just inside the carb union which
looks ideal for the version of WI reported in
this bull.  Stab in a needle there.  The water
bottle will probably have to be below the tin
floor, to prevent gravity feed  -  just inside
rear L corner of body looks OK.
	I know it sounds almost too good to be
true  -  but all my claims are readily
substantiated, mainly from SAE pubns, and I have
no commercial interest in any WI kits.  So, go to
it campers.
	 Can we even envisage a corroboree called
Buses Of The Water, a few years hence?  Would
alcohol be banned at such a confabulation? No -
if only because some volksfolks will be injecting
50% methanol, in memory of die Krdute, early
creators (in many good planes) of WI.

	I look fw to hearing from those who try
WI.  Sorry, I have no experience with aftermarket
carbs branded Screamin' Eagle or similar.  Nor do
I particularly want to hear from the sort of folk
who ride Hawgs with that sub-brand; and yet, one
of my best friends does!  Strange &amp; eerie are the
bonds of the aircoolheads and the sickles.
Internal cooling has much to offer their personal
coolth.


	MannGram: IMPROVEMENT TO WATER INJECTION  bull 1.2
					Aug 2006

Intro
	My MannGram on WI  -  downloadable, with
color diagrams, from Dave Cushman's site
http://www.dave-cushman_dot_net/misc/mannject.html  -
argued that the best place to insert a water jet
in the induction tract of a carburetted engine is
in the venturi, just inside the throttle
butterfly.  This can achieve up to 14% fuel
savings.  And yes, I am happy to increase the
carbon dioxide emissions by a tiny percentage,
for the reward of halving the carbon monoxide
emissions, and the unburnt fuel considerably.
	But what about carbs sans butterfly?
Slide carbs (Amal, Gardner, Jikov, etc) have no
butterfly, nor typically any pre-made water
injection point in the venturi corresponding to
the vacuum retard bleed just inside the
butterfly.  (SU fans please investigate inner
plumbing.)
	We are, however, talking considerable
benefits in power, economy, emissions, and
cooling  -  for negligible cost.

Summary
	The main recent testing has been several
thousand km on a decade-old Jawa 50cc.  A water
jet inserted at the gasket between the carb
(small Jikov) flange and the inlet on the
crankcase improves power, not only during
wide-throttle acceleration but then to maintain
max speed on about half-throttle when the inlet
vacuum (after the slide and main/needle jet) is
presumably higher than at full throttle.


Method for a typical Sickle

1.  Remove carb.

2.  In the flange washer, cut a groove, approx
vertical, at bottom.  This may be done in situ,
with a sharp blade, esp if it's glued on; or if
washer is easily removed, cut on bench with
chisel.
	If you have not a flange coupling but a
male nozzle from the crankcase and a tube from
the carb clamping onto that nozzie, glue the
needle into a hole in that tube.

3.  Cut e.g with a triangular file a stainless
medical needle to length making the new top end
about in the middle of the mixture tract i.e
middle of 'ole from carb.

4.  Cut to length 4mm ID flexible pipe to bottom
of water bottle or jar lower than carb e.g under
fork pivot.  'Ware fouling stand operations.

5.  Slap pipe thru hole in bottle cap.

6.  Add weight &amp; filter to bottom of pipe.

7.  Affix bottle to static frame, mudguard etc.

8.  Glue needle hilt into top end of pipe

9.  Reinstall carb with needle in the groove

10.  'Ware massive wheelstands as you open
throttle wide; after front wheel has returned to
road, settle on max speed.

11.  Ease off throttle to 2/3.  Observe speed
holding; note quieter exhaust as less fuel is
burnt.


Details
	Some thin papery washers are only about
as thick as the OD of a small needle, as suitable
for e.g 50cc stroker, around 0.71mm ('23 G') to
average water/fuel ca.5%.  Tighten the flange
onto a bigger needle and you'll squash it  -  not
necessarily shut, but to some unknown oval shape.
I suspect a bigger engine will need a needle more
the size of the blood-donor needle.  Big needles
will require thicker washers  -  no bad thing,
indeed some of us have sliding tubes up to 5 cm
of adjustable intake tract tuning on sickles.
Think trombone!  My memorable casual interview
with John Britten didn't reveal any secrets of
his intake tract, but did confirm that its tuning
was a reason for that engine's power.
	 Thicker washers are not difficult to
make; thermal insulation and perhaps some
vibration-damping are desirable.  Drilling
JapScrap may be an easy source of suitable
washers.


Next Research
	I would like to acquire one or two
cylinder-head thermometers that fit in the place
of a spark-plug washer.
	Measuring fuel and fuel/water flows is
difficult.  Microlites may offer best chance to
get data; Rotax would probably not pretend
warranty was voided, as WI is well known to give
air-cooled aero engines better cooling &amp; economy.
	I suspect suction is greater at
part-throttle cruise than wide open  -  it
definitely is with butterfly carbs.  WI rate may
therefore be higher at cruising than at max
acceleration.  So long as the water feed-rate is
enough at wide-open throttle to thoroughly quash
preignition, it may well be good if water
feed-rate rises during part-throttle cruise when
inlet manifold vacuum is higher.

Reports from experience are solicited.  While
governments muck around with possible
requirements several y hence, we can improve
economy &amp; decrease pollution, saving about 10% of
petrol consumption.  Could we even hope to break
John Dale's economy record on a Matchless 350  -
ca320 mpg, wasn't it?
