Subject: vw picture book

The Tampa Tribune used to have this really great automotive section.  The
photgrapher would take the car they were featuring that week somewhere
representative of something about the car and then take the picture with
that place/thing in view as well as the car.  You looked at the picture and
then read the article about the car (usually some gross new sedan with a
million horse power and no *class*) to see what the photographer was
alluding to.

Anyway, what would people think of doing that, only with all busses?  I
'spose it could be done with all vws, but that would get a little BIG.  I
had an idea to take pictures of  just MY bus in a whole bunch of different
representative places, but I think it would be better to have a whole bunch
of busses in a whole bunch of places.  There are huge, professional coffee
table books all about vws (atleast I've seen a couple about beetles) and
this would be a cool one.  With history of busses in general, personal bus
backgrounds, other cool stuff like that!  I sure would buy it sooner than
I'd buy a book that just had factory busses in it, wouldn't everyone else?
