&gt;I've acquired (maybe he went home?). I do, however have these #'s

Here goes: 

&gt;6Jx14H2

Rim size


&gt;1084000902

Mercedes partnumber

&gt;AS1062

No idea...  -maybe- alloy composition?  (like AS41) ...?

&gt;3 7 (with the 7 in a circle)

This could be the ET, and if it is, it is a very good canditate for on a Bus 
could it be sloppy work, and that both numbers should have been in the 
circle?


&gt;1.27760
&gt;     1

Again..  no idea....
