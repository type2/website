Subject: Side Vent Window Frames

Hi Everyone,

I have a newly acquired '74 Micro... Just spent the weekend tearing it
apart for a resto and found some unsalvageable parts.  I have vent
windows in both the driver's rear window sections which are very rusted
at the bottom.  I need the frame to bus and the frame to glass, are
these only available used?  Any suggestions on where to find them?

Thanks,

Tom
