Subject: Re: [T2] Monza style exhaust,

&gt; Why is this the worst to pick?  I've had mine on for eight years.  It's
&gt; a little rusty, but still functions fine, and have never had a problem
&gt; with exhaust fumes getting into cabin.
&gt; -David

I agree. While mine's only several months old now, aside from the rust
there's no problem. And it's $60 cheaper than the OEM style that BD
sells...

I just got some new-to-me heat exchangers (finally the correct ones!
Yippee!!!) and spent today cleaning them. I'm now in the process of
painting them with black header paint to hopefully give them some
protection from Denver winters.

When I go to install them (which won't happen until at least the 15th
due to a trip to Denver for the company open house and some house
hunting from the 4th to the 10th of Jan) I'll wire wheel, prep, and
use header paint on the muffler as well. Then I'll get a better idea
of how long the Empi mufflers will last.
