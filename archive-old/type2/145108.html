Subject: RE: [T2] One version of why we are &quot;orphans&quot; of VW

The dealers tended to treat Phaeton owners as if they were $20k Jetta 
owners. They nickeled-and-dimed them, trying to squeeze $30 ....&gt;

And stories like THAT is one reason I choose to do my own work whenever 
possible (has worked for 15 years now...). I refuse to be chaged over 
the top prices for mediocre repairs by people who lie to me and treat 
me like an idiot when I know more about my car than most of the staff! 
My 1 new car buying experience was like that as well. Dealers lying, 
didn't know anything about the vehicles they were selling, etc. I'll 
continue to drive used cars from here on out and right now am slowly 
working on educating myself on how to use an OBDII bluetooth dongle to 
connect my PalmPilot to my car for diagnostic info. Will cost me about 
$200 for the dongle but that is paid for with 3 trips to a dealer! My 
Italian friends has enough work for 3 shops b/c he fixes cars honestly, 
correctlym and courteously! He's an offical Opel dealer but repairs all 
brands. I have often though about opening a repair shop, getting my 
certification in the appropriate topics, etc. At least I'd be working 
for myself! &lt;a key goal for me&gt;
