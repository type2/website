Subject: Re: [T2] Trans question

Chris:
Change the bellhousing and input shaft. Need a circlip pliers to get the collar
loose.
The72 (in USA, anyway, with type 4 engine) had a longer input shaft. You could
just cut it off, but it is extremely hard and will need a grinder with a cut off
wheel.

&gt; To the list,
&gt;
&gt; Can I use the trans from my 72 Westy in the 71 Westy? From what I understand
&gt; the gearing is the same but the top mount is the deference. Is this correct?
