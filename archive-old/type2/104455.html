Subject: Re:Re: [T2] back up light woes

And don't forget, the 12Volt source for the backup lights comes from the 12V
side of the coil, right? There should be a wire and connector that comes
from the gearbox into the engine compartment on the left side in the
proximity of the coil (at least on my '71). Once I hooked this up correctly
I was able to trace the problem to bulbs, dirty sockets, etc.

&gt;
&gt; Yes - just test the wiring where it come back into the engine compartment
&gt; on it's way to the lights. Also don't test with the engine running, just
&gt; key on.
&gt;
&gt; Your safe. Block the wheels and put the E-brake on. If you want put a
&gt; trusted friend in the cab with their foot on the brake and to be extra
safe
&gt; remove the wire from the coil to the dist.
