Subject: Brake Dilemma:'69 Westy...(long, but I need help!)

All,

Well, the time has come for me to overhaul my '69
Westy's brakes...happy-happy-joy-joy!

Here's the scoop... I adjusted the brakes last week,
but I now get a scraping noise from the rigth-rear
wheel on applying the brakes. Now...when I adjusted
them, the amount of pad seemed fine (1/8&quot;+ per Muir),
but I didn't have the drum off and had to eye-ball it
rather than get an accurate measurement.

I also noticed a little moisture around the brake
cylinders, leading me to believe I now have to replace
them as well (I couldn't see all that well as the drum
was still on, but there was definite moisture and no
recent rain, etc.). Bummer. They're less than 4 years
old, too.8-(

I *believe* I have the adequate tools for the job as
well, but I only have the little EMPI (there's that
word again;-) tool for removing the rear-axle nut.
Less than ideal, I know, but it's all I have.


So here's the dilemma: I don't have the cash to do
this job properly! I'd planned on doing this job the
right way (new everything) this summer, but obviously,
the bus doesn't want to wait;-)

So I'd like to replace the rear shoes only now and do
it properly in a few months. Is this stupid? My only
other option is to either continue driving as-is and
destroy my drum (possibly/probably more than one), or
park it until I have the $$$ (but it's the only
vehicle for a household of 3).

Now...the cylinders don't leak enough to be noticed
(I've never had to add fluid in 2 years...no fade/need
to pump the pedal), but I realize that this can change
rapidly.

Also, I only drive 5-6 miles per day (average), but it
is all stop-n-go. No highway and except for my
driveway... no hills, either. I'm *not* worried from a
safety standpoint, as I've seen the brakes/cylinders,
etc., and I do know a bit from previous brake-jobs
(though on non-VW's), so I trust the system in it's
current state to last another month until I can do it
right.

BUT....

It seems to me, that putting new pads on the rear
(without a complete R&amp;R on the cylinders) could
actually cause the cylinders' seals to degrade more
quickly, as they might come into contact with more
pitting &lt;the seal's travel-area will be changed by the
thicker pads&gt;, etc.


So, is this a bad idea? Should I just bite the bullet
and sacrifice the drum by driving as-is until next
month? Any opinions??? Parking it is only a last
resort, so any help will be appreciated.


TIA.
