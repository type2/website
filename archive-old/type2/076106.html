&gt; Anyone confirm?

I am running 205/R70-14 and based on my before after speedo calibration
the difference is almost nil, maybe 4% on the speedo

&gt; I am running 205/75R-14 - a little taller than stock.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I'll have 110 HP soon so who cares.
&gt; 
&gt; I figure the VW Type2 is a pretty low geared beast to start with so I don't 
&gt; want to give up anything by going to a smaller tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Understand that this is a tiny difference. I'll bet it is no more than the 
&gt; difference between a new tire and a worn one.
&gt; 
&gt; Ciao!
