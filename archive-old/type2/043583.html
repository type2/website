Subject: Re: Cleaning caked engine parts

Jeremy et al,

I clean tin the old fashion way: HOT soapy (laundry detergent) water. I
usually try a putty knife on greasy caked tin. If the gook is hard, let it
soak for about an hour in the hottest soapy water you have available. A
sturdy grill and some scrap wood helps a lot with this. Then pull the tin
and use the putty knife on it. Follow up with a stiff-bristled brush.
Change the water as you need to...plan to shower and change clothes when done.

Elbow grease takes off motor oil...and in my experience, it's faster
(though messier) than most chemicals. There are a couple chemical
treatments that will work faster, but they're more expensive and less
environmentally sound IMHO.

Thanks! Joe


&gt;Today is a work day, yesterday I was able to remove the fan shroud, all
engine tin, etc... Now I am down to a bunch of dirty parts caked with
sludgy, caked oil. I am curious of the best way to clean these components?
