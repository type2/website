Subject: RE: Bus tires.

Hello,

Geez, I just purchased a new set of tires for my '79 Westy.  I thought I
did my homework and eventually decided on a full set of 185R14 Michelin MX
6ply reinforced tires with a load/speed rating of 94R (1540lbs.)  I
must've called a dozen places trying to find a deal.  Best price I found  
was $90ea (installed).  Other tire considerations were the usual suspects,
Bridgestone 603V ($10 cheaper) and Yokohama 356 (couldn't find around
here.)  Guess I went with the Michelin because of the name and the
recommendations from mechanics and FLAPS folks.

But now am I to assume that these are not up to spec?

&gt;  You shouldn't fit a tyre to a bus that has a number less than 95
&gt; and that's the absolute bare minimum (1520lbs). To do so is akin
&gt; to fitting S-rated (112mph) tyres to a 150mph Mustang: they arn't
&gt; up to the job, are illegal and dangerous.
&gt;
&gt;  To get acceptable handling most listees recommend at least a 97
&gt; load index (roughly equivalent to a six-ply rating) which equates
&gt; to 1609lbs, to be honest 99 (1709lbs) or so works better. This is
&gt; in the vicinity of an &quot;eight ply rating&quot; tyre. If you push up into
&gt; &quot;load range D&quot; territory then you are looking at 100/102 load
&gt; indices (max load about 1800lbs) and you start to trade a firm
&gt; ride against more stability (ie not if you have a bad back!!).

Where did you get these figures?  I searched through the archives for tire
info and didn't find any specs this demanding.  Most tire dealers I spoke
with said the reinforced MX was made specially for Vanagons; most also
did not stock these tires and had to place a special order.

Since we're on the subject... what exactly does it mean to have a load
rating of say, 1540lbs?  Does that mean 4 tires with that load rating can
support 4 x 1540lbs?  Or is this per axle?

I don't have the owner's manual for the Westy... anyone know the weight of
one of these?

Anyway, I've had these Michelins for a week and have been very happy.  Oh,
she handles like a dream!  Can't wait to see how gas milage improves.
Although... anything would have been an improvement over the
cracked and balding old Yokohamas I used to have!
