Subject: Boneyard find

A few weeks ago, we were driving by a boneyard on the way home and on 
top of the hill was a Westy.  It was Sunday and we were coming home 
from a &quot;backpacking&quot; trip, so we didn't stop.

Yesterday on the way home from my wife's dad's funeral, my daughter and 
I (and Greta) stopped in.

This is an early bay (round reflectors) and the Westy interior has been 
removed except for the pad over the engine and the wood headliner over 
that.  The canvas is prolly shot.

The front seats (recently re-done) and retractable seatbelts (!) are 
there.

The engine is a mexican block dual port with a Weber &amp; 009 &amp; merged 
quiet pack exhaust.

The body has the usual rust issues along the rockers.  The front and 
rear bumpers are smashed.  The driver's side &quot;battery tray&quot; is not 
there.

I asked they guy about it and he said it could be driven home.  He 
wants $950 for it (probably negotiable).  I did not try to start it up 
or drive it.

It is at:
Glenn's Auto Parts
110 Highway 70
Rockwood, TN 37854
(865) 354-0622

Now you know what I know.

Chris
