Subject: LED's

Hi All,

After reading the thread on LED's I couldn't keep quiet any longer. I work
for Hewlett-Packard and one of our divisions manufactures ultra bright
LED's - in the colors mentioned AND in WHITE.
They also sell them installed in a little holder containing a battery - its
on my key chain as an emergency flash light. No, I'm not kidding - its that
bright.
Sorry, I don't know the specs, but I just wanted people to know that the
technology is out there.

I also happen to own a couple of heavyweight American made motorcycles, and
there are OEM replacements for brakes lights made from LED arrays.

What we need is some EE to figure this out for those of us electrically
challenged.

On a more on topic subject, anybody ever have to take apart the sliding door
lock? Everything functions fine except the lock will not move.

Pete
