Subject: I love the bus depot

The Bus Depot has goofed up my orders a couple times, but i dont care, I can
always send the part back or sell it to a friend...I have ordered from them
numerous times (and I live in CANADA) where air-cooled parts are few and far
between.

I would like to thank Ron and the staff at the Bus Depot for a great service
to myself and rest of the Bus community, I highly appreciate what you
do....and I thank you very much.

I dont live in a hurry, and sometimes 7 - 10 business days is still too
fast!!

My hats off to the Bus Depot..keep up the amazing job!
