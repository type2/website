I just got the whole floor section for my bus (I think its Brazialian made
though) (has a Brazil Stamp on them) from
http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk/katalogue/newbody.html. Took a while to get
them (about a month and a week) but they look pretty good. No brackets on
them for seats, but if your doing camper interior it doesn't really matter.
You'll have to notch out a couple little sections in the back too for heater
tubes. Hope this is what you were looking for.
