&gt; I _paid_ $7k for my '54!!  I was hoping more like $40k when restored.

Certainly I'm hoping my '67 Deluxe would be worth that too!  Give
it some time.  Our contemporaries are coming of age and they will
continue to pay more and more for their lost childhoods.

The following is the paragraph on values by those who submitted
to the NEATO Old Bus Registry.

     Estimated value is another subject.  Only 104 of the
     submittals included an estimated value, for a total of
     $490,257 and an average value of $4,714.  A few people
     didn't understand that this was meant to be a dollar
     amount, though perhaps they understood that the value
     of their old bus really is not in dollars.  There were
     several who wrote in &quot;priceless&quot; or &quot;millions&quot; and
     another who saw some humor in the situation, for he
     just wrote &quot;HA!&quot;.  Three buses were listed at $20,000,
     and somewhere there are some very good deals on parts
     cars, because five were listed at less than $100.

Maybe the value is not in the dollar, but another currency we
have yet to be able to measure.

&gt;&gt; BTW, I'd like to shake the hand for anyone who'd pay &gt; $10K for some of
&gt;&gt; these vans.

&gt; There's sposed to be a deluxe for sale in the Land of No Rust for $60k

Yeh, I think I saw that episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next
Generation&quot; but I don't think my bus will be on the next shuttle
launch.
