Subject: 71 bus
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I recently purchased a 1971 bus for a 3 month long
journey this summer.  The previous owner installed one
of those silly weber carbrators, and a local guru told
me that it would be in my best interest to put an
original solex back on the van.  
In order to do this I need to change the
&quot;brachet&quot;(part in rear that connects to the stock end
castings) that the carbrator is mounted on.  I was
told that I need to remove the generator and fan
housing so that I can access this piece.  He said that
is is possible but difficult to remove these parts
with out dropping the engine.  Any suggestions on how
I might be able to accomplish this would be very
appricaited.  
                Thanks
