I hear this Sunday is the Pomona swap meet.

I live out here and yet I've never been.
But I'm going this time.

Just wondering if anyone on the list who has been there and has some tips 
for me.
I've been to the bus shows and found a billion splitty parts for my 67 
deluxe, but this is the first time I'm going with ('69) baywindow/westy 
parts on my list.
Are there really any people out there with post-67 bus stuff?
I'v also heard of people going on Saturday night. When/where is this? Is it 
for vendors only?

And, are there any areas I should go to first, or avoid?

Thanks for the tips

Jason
