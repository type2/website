&gt;  folks pointed out that A: they owned the rights to what they had written; 
&gt;  and B: they hadn't given anybody permission to sell them for financial 
&gt;  gain-even for the non-profit support of the list.  At the time, the general 

You know what I find funny about this is that most of all the posts to the
list aren't worth the time it took to write them when it comes down to
it and this includes everything I've ever written.  I know it sounds bad
but think about it.  If you had to &quot;pay&quot; to get on this list, would you
have even joined?  Probably not. We've reposted
the same old hoopla time and time again and about the only things that are
useful are tips on where to find the latest cheap dub for sale or getting
parts from buddies that can't be had anywhere else.  And who would be dumb
enough to pay for old for-sale posts?  I've gotten a kick out of this
latest uprising of the list.  All you really need is a Bentley and you're
set - we're all smart enough to figure out stuff on our own.  The #1
beneficial thing about the list is the comraderie in my opinion.  You need
it when you're an auto minority.

With that said, you can take another worthless post of mine and delete
it! If you can actually get someone to pay you for this post, you're
doing pretty damn good. :-)

BTW: Does anyone have a BN-2 gas heater they
wanna sell?
