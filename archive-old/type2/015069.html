&gt;Just out of curiosity I went out to take a look at my CV's to see if they
&gt;were bolted tight.
&gt;
&gt;Here's what I found.
&gt;
&gt;On the 83 Aircooled Westfalia. The bolts are ALLEN head cap screws.
&gt;
&gt;On the 82 Aircooled Vanagon the bolts are 12 Point scocket head screws.
&gt;
The original air-cooled Vanagons had 12 points, but anyone who has ever
taken the CV's apart replaced them with Allen heads, at least anyone with
any sense.  The chances are that virtually all 80 - 83 Vanagons have Allen
heads now, but there are certainly a few with 12 points.  Check before you
get started.
Ian, 82 with Allen heads.
