&gt; Is your beam rusted through?
&gt; I would prepare yourself with a few ideas before start into this.
&gt;
&gt; This is a list of &quot;do it right the first time, when you have it out&quot;. You
&gt; can just swap it out and drive it, I just wouldn't recommend it.
&gt; The ball joints on the trailing arm should be replace with new ones at this
&gt; point ( not just any shop can do this in fact most vw shops cannot)

let Joe do this

&gt; Dropping a beam is not a trivial task it has a lot of parts that pass
&gt; through the upper and lower beam.

it's also heavy as all get out....make sure you have a GOOD jack for it.

&gt; We have provided all of the parts to customers and done this work here in
&gt; our shop.

I bought a beam from Joe couple years back, had him press in the ball
joints and ship the mess half way cross the country.  it was as he said
not a trivial job, but it also was not difficult just a lot of steps and
working with some BIG pieces....

 read up on it, get some long breaker bars (5 ft piece of pipe) at a
minimum two jacks and two jack stands. 4 of each is better.  don't need a
lot of different tools but you will need some time with each  joint, heck
start hitting the nuts now with PB-Blaster or equivalent...

&gt; Feel free to contact me if you have any questions along the way.

yes Joe is a well spring of good information, also get your parts from him
now before he gets a &quot;Real&quot; job.
