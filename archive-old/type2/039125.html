listees,
i just wanted to say thanks for all the advice on my
idling problem, or lack there of, but the winners were
dave russel and kelly who told me to check my
electromagnetic idle cut-off valve(big thanks).   when
i got home i unscrewed it part of the way and my idle
came right up.   thanks everyone for all the help, im
now in search for a replacement.   as a side note,
this valve originally had  a wire connected to it
which i understand its function, but it has not been
connected for about a year and ive never had idling
problems before?   it is ok to drive it around town
with this valve unscrewed a little isnt it?   its so
sunny ill probably take the top off the J_at__at_P and drive
it anyways.
thanks all
shelby
