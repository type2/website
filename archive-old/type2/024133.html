Subject: Just an idea on heating
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was thinking of useing one heater box functioning normal up the channel to 
the front with a blower in line while useing the second box to blow air 
through the fire wall and out from under the back seat. Has anyone 
sucessfully done this, let me know .
