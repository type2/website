Subject: Re: [T2] swivel foot adjusters?

Why use this on a hydraulic lifter controlled valve adjustor?  Due to
the nature of the lifter, the tappet should always be in contact with
the valve end and thus will not mushroom the adjustor or the valve stem
as in nonhydraulic engines.  I pulled a tappet on my 78 bus after
220,000 miles and it was not worn, just shiny! (see attached pic).  I
was aonce told if you use a swivel foot you take away the intentional
offset contact that helps to keep the valve rotating.

&gt; hello all. does anyone out there know where I might get my greasy little
&gt; mitts on a set of swivel foot, or is it feet or perhaps footi ;) adjusters
