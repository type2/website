Subject: Re: [T2] Euro 1600 rear tin

This brings up the question of exactly how much of the tin on euro 72 
and up buses with stock 1600s is different than regular 1600 tin? 
Does any one have a diagram form a Euro publication of Bentley or 
Hanes that they can scan or put up? I have seen some nice homemade 
patchwork on 72 up buses with 1600s but never seen the real tin.

Furthermore do Euro 72 and up buses with 1600s use a hanger bar for 
the motor or does the tranny support the lighter 1600 motor?


Consumed with odd details,
Chris

&gt;Below 3 links to pictures that I made of the rear engine tin
&gt;for a '72 and later 1600 Bus.
