Steve,

Correctamundo, on killing everything that consumes the anti-freeze.

I was under the impression that's where we were going, wiht this,
talking about peanut butter and bacon traps, etc.

But tell me this---how in the heck is a cat or a dog going to get inside
a locked and stored bus?

I thought we were talking about eliminating vermin in a parked vehicle,
not about laying pans around for every animal that passes to imbibe!

Ever smelled rat pee that has been inside a closed up vehicle, for any
period of time?

Gag, Cough, PHOOEY!!
