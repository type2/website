Subject: Re: Supplemental Engine fan...

My first Bus was a '71 Westy that went through a couple engines - with
help from my wife - so the last one I put in I tried to improve my odds of
it lasting. I got a 6&quot; fan, I think it was from some computer application,
and mounted it pointing at the left of the engine. I hooked it up to the
taillights so whenever my Berg dipstick thermometer started flashing me I
would turn on the running lights. That little fan would cool things down
about 10-15 degrees depending on the outside conditions. And the engine is
still going 10 years later (with a new owner).

&gt; Subject: Supplemental Engine fan...

&gt; But.... I was at my local VW guy's shop last week and he had a beautiful
&gt; 1966 Westy with a DP 1600 in it. Splittys are all but extinct in eastern
&gt; Massachusetts. This bus had a big electric fan mounted on the drivers side
&gt; of the engine compartment sucking air into it from the vent. Not an oil
&gt; cooler, just a fan. I guess this is to supplement the engine cooling fan.
&gt;
&gt; My question: will this fan actually lower engine temps?
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have experience with fans in there just for cooling?
