&gt;Question:  Has the Blue locktite ever given any problems in getting the
&gt;gland nut off?  The last time I removed a gland nut was from a mystery
&gt;motor and it required me jumping on the end of a 6-foot cheater and
&gt;application of my entire blue vocabulary.  I suspect that this one was due
&gt;to loktite.

There are several grades of Loktite. Too many people overtorque. Too many
laymen think if some is good, more is better and too much is just enough.
Factory procedure is threads clean and dry. If assembled per specs and used
as intended, it will not come off. Anti-seize is misused far more often
than most will accept, just like Loktite. I advise use neither in this
application. But as I said before, if that's not good enough for you, use
blue Loktite, and just two or three drops max. It will not be a problem for
removal if all else is stock. Now if you use something stronger, don't
bring it to my shop and expect a flat rate bill.

A German gland nut can be reused, but only if you know for certain that it
has never been overtorqued. That is rarely the case, hence, only a new
gland nut can insure against failure.
