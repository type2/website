Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter fried?

my multi meter broke also while back and after buying a new one it was suggested that i take my old one to a tv repair shop that they might be able to help me get my old one fixed as well..
maybe check with a tv repair shop first even though there was smoke involved...
 
i bought my multi meter at autozone after a extensive search from a wide distance they were the only ones to carry one..
i think i paid like 30 bucks for it..?
still have my old one;;;;;; one day i will take to the tv repAIR SHOP????.
 
they both are the same they have dwell/tach/volt all in one..
sorry to hear of your troubles....
good luck Ray
peace and love
chris

We'll, I broke out the digital multimeter with
hopes of figuring out why I've had starting
problems... and hoping it's not a solenoid
hotstart problem. I've had it quite awhile and
lost my directions. Anyway, I crossed the
positive and negative across the battery and made
smoke from within the thin. Any chance I didn't
kill it? 

Are there any multimeter for dummies pages out
there? I really have NO CLUE what to do with
this thing? I don't really even know what some
of the symbols mean. Kind of explains my
aversion to FI, right?

Feelin' pretty dumb tonight....


Happy bussin'
