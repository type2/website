Brad,

I'm not sure I agree with you on the idea that since there are fewer
Riviera's than Westy's, they should be more collectible.

I'm not going to go into the Westy VS. Riviera arguement, BUT....the
Riviera was a U.S. conversion based on the sunroof model bus, whereas
the Westy was a German conversion. *I* think people are more
interested in what came from Germany, but that's just me. 

Being German, the Westy is a little more, well, foreign! Seriously,
you look at the stuff and go, &quot;wow, these people sure think
differently than we do!&quot;. It adds to the charm.

Plus, most of the parts used in the Riviera conversion were
&quot;off-the-shelf&quot; items used in many U.S. made R.V.'s. This is great
when you need to replace something (just tool on down to the local
&quot;Camping-World&quot;), but really cuts down on the uniqueness that a Westy
possesses.

The reason that alot of people in the U.S. (let alone anywhere else)
have never seen one, is that they were made in Beaverton, Oregon, by
Riviera Motors (the local VW retailer) and they were the sole retailer
for them. This is why they are so common in the Northwest, as well as
California. They (as well as every other VW dealer in the U.S. at the
time) could not get enough Westy's to keep up with demand, so they
made their own version.

As I said, I'm not saying one is better than the other, just
different. Actually, I'm quite proud to say that the Riviera's were
made just a few miles from where I once lived (Yes, it REALLY is
called &quot;Beaverton&quot;, it's right next to &quot;Aloha&quot;!!!).

For what it's worth, Westy's are a lot more quirky, but that's why I
like mine;-)

Also, If you (or anyone else on the list) are interested, you can get
NOS Riviera Motors license plate holders from Always V-Dub in
Portland, Or. Call Ashley at (503) 235-2757 and tell him I sent you.
These are black plastic with white lettering and, as I recall, fairly
cheap. Don't know how many he's got, though.

PS-I liked your web-page...you wouldn't want to send me a copy of the
WESTY photo at the bottom, would you (it looks identical to my '69
Westy and I'd like a copy for a page I'm building.)?


Jaime
