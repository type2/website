 Looks like the seals on my steering box are shot!
 There is oil all round it :-(
 
 Can I add oil until I can get around to
 repairing/replacing it? &gt;&gt;

this reminded me of a question i wanted to post last week but forgot......it 
seems that we are supposed to change fluids in all parts on a regular basis, 
wheel bearings repacked, tranny gear change, lube this, oil that......etc.  i 
have never heard of a steering box oil change??  is this not needed??  can it 
be done??  how??  i am sure mine needs it....wouldnt we all change the fluid 
to save a $200+++ part.???
