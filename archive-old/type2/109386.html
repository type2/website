&gt; Do check the prices at CIP1_dot_com. I found them to be the best for VDO
gauges
&gt; even before their 5% of web order and they have the &quot;nla&quot; 10x1 hose
&gt; (sometimes out of stock but currently in stock).

Yep, that is where I have found everything. The price came up beating
everyone else by about $40-$60 and they have free shipping on orders over
$150! Came to about $160 for all of the gauges and senders.  The hose is
back in stock but the head temp kit is out right now so I am waiting on
that.


&gt; Junkyard. It was part number 039 101 267 but it's NLA.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Is this the same thing
&gt; &gt; found here at BusBoys http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/bbvdo.htm#tempoil , third
one
&gt; &gt; down for $21.94?
&gt;
&gt; Not sure. Give Walter a call and find out.


I'll give him a call tommorow and let people know.


&gt; Your case also need to have this cutout in order to get an accurate
reading:

Did you do this cut yourself? If so how/with what did you cut it out and how
did you keep the shavings out of the sump?

Thanks!
