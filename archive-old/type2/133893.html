Subject: Rear Brake Backing Plate Removal

I was hoping for some tips and pointers as I renew the rear brakes of
my 71 singlecab.

My question concerns the brake backing plates. I bought new ones
because I ruined one in attempting to remove a stubbornly stuck star
adjuster.  (Never got that sucker out). I thought I'd spring for two
new ones instead of just one.

Now I have one old backing plate removed from the car without
incident, but I'm having trouble removing the other one.  I took out
the two big bolts but the thing is still stubbornly attached.  I tried
liquid wrench and a rubber mallet but it's still stuck. I'm using
force judiciously as I want to keep me and the car safe.

Does anyone know any secrets or sure-fire methods to removing a stuck
backing plate?

Thanks,

BG
