Subject: Re: [T2] Weber carb Vac line placement....

I have a SVDA (the ACN one) hooked up to my Weber via the port in the
back (RIR). I don't have the documentation stack relevant to the Weber
of the dizzy with me. Based on how it performs (compared to the 009 the
dizzy replaced) I figure that I used the right port. I thought retard
came from the manifold, not the carb. Regardless, I don't have a retard
on my dizzy, so I shouldn't be trusted for gospel on that.
Good luck,

&gt; there is also a small port on the rear of
&gt; the carb (rear is rear) and there is another small
&gt; port on the right (passenger) side of the carb. So
&gt; which is advance, which is retard, etc. etc.
&gt; Also, I'm not sure about the dizzy on this engine.
&gt; Should there even be a DUAL vac dizzy on a 1700 engine?
