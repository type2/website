&gt;       Glad you're out of hospital!
&gt;       Sorry to tell you, the finger-tip O2 sensor uses light transmision/
&gt;absorbtion of hemoglobin to measure O2 level in your blood. So if you
&gt;want to measure your VW's exhaust O2, you or some other critter has to wear 
&gt;the sensor and breathe the exhaust... not, maybe, the best technique for
&gt;monitoring an engine.
&gt;
&gt;       Check your bill too- those things may not look like they
&gt;cost more than $2 to make but wanna bet you paid $20 for it? At
&gt;Stanford University Hospital one dose of Tylenol was $7 or thererabouts.
Just a comment: When you go to the hospital they send you a bill????
Wow! Scary concept! Having just spent a few days watching my new daughter
in the special care nursery, I'd hate to think how big the bill would
be. Even worse, the bill for the Premies that have been in there for several
months. God I love Canada! No guns, Universal Medicine, Polite people, Snow, 
Bugs.....
