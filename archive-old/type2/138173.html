&lt;&lt; I could picture him taking in old VWs and dropping rebuilt engines and
redoing all the suspension and brakes and selling them for reasonable

There was a small company doing this a few years back with Beetles...
Golden Vee was the name, IIRC. The problem today, as we all know, is
rust...The supply of rust-free starter shells is dwindling and rust repair
is much more time consuming - hence expensive - than mechanical.
Carry this over to the Bus and the cost escalates...How many busses
have been scrapped because of front beam rust alone... ?-(
