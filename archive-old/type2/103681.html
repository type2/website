&gt;I am new to busses, and would appreciate help in recognising what
&gt;distinguishing marks to look for. Most of the engine labelling in missing, but
&gt;I can see what appears to be &quot;AW-A&quot;. Can any of you old hands translate that
&gt;for me? To add to the confusion, do people ever bore-out the 1800s to 2000?

People &quot;bore out&quot; 1700's to 1800's or even to 1900's, but to get to 2.0 generally requires switching to the 2.0 crankshaft, which has a 5mm longer stroke than the 1.7-1.8 crankshaft.

As others have mentioned, there is no easy way to determine the displacement without at least partially disassembling the motor.
