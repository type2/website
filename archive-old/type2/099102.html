Subject: Re: [T2] trying to get engine in my 71

Did you make sure clutch disk is really centered over the pilot
bearing?  I've laid on the ground and pushed on each side of the engine
with my feet as someone else wiggled the crank.  Check the angle of the
engine (flywheel) to the trans housing- are they PARALLEL upon side
view?  If not, lower the jack and tip, or raise the jack.  A real
sectret is to make sure the engine and trans are both parallel to the
ground upon wich you are trying to roll the jack.  In my 71, when I
raised the rear of the bus about 4&quot;, I lowered the trans so it was
parallel to the ground- makes getting to the upper engine bolts easier
also, and the jack will NOT change the height of the engine as it rolls
forward.
   In my past, I pulled/replaced the engine using 2 scissors jacks on
either side of the sump plate, which stood on a 2x2' board that sat upon
2 broom handle dowels.  Alignment was easily achieved by tapping on the
board with a sledge as I lay under the bus.
