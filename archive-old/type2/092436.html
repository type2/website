&gt; As for cylinder head gauges I've tried VDO ones but didn't find them

&gt; plugs as often as I should have.

 From what I understand, type-3 dual port heads -- which will work on 
your average 1600dp -- have
holes in the in the head where CHT senders can be screwed in.  I'm 
considering going with
these next time I buy heads...
