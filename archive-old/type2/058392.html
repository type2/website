Subject: Rear Window

I have an extra rear window w/defroster for my '68 Type 2 that I need to get rid of.  It'll
probably fit other years.  It's in Seaside, CA and if you come get it, it's free.  (although I
could use a spare rim for a '71).  It must be gone by 5 OCT.  E-mail me if your interested.


John
