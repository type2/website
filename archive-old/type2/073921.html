Subject: 1971 Westfalia

Hello All,
Anyone there? I am new and green as grass in the spring on this list. I 
found a 1971 Westy in Washington state for 3000 dollars. Motor is a fresh 
rebuilt and the unit is complete and rust free. I camped in it for a few 
days and fell in love. Now I want to buy. Should I?  Would like to tow my 
BMW motorcycle and the 1600 motor sure is no powerhouse. The interior is 
good and complete but the canvas is going south. Tires are fair. Paint is 
fresh. The mechanic is a personal friend and been in the business for 20 
years. The deal includes redone front seats and a bumper hitch. I want to 
buy.  Stop me now or put up with me in the future.  Thank you,  Bill 
Shockley, Tomahawk, WI.
