Subject: It runs, needs tweaks......

I finally got over the despair of installing the engine and still not having a working motor.  It was running, but leaking fuel from carb.  I went through and sealed up leaks, intake manifold, exhaust pipe and capped off some emmisions tubing.  So the bad boy starts and idles now, BUT  when I give it gas it backfires.  I still have misc parts to finish installing before actually tackling backfire issue, but would like to know what to look for when I start.
