Ooopps   Misprint....that should have said 72 pop top....

This is a complete non-deluxe Westy. Anyone need anything from it? It is in
Fresno, Calif.


&gt; I found a 69 pop top Westy at a wrecking yard today. I removed the perfect
&gt; front headliner wood section. It did not appear to ever have been removed
&gt; before. There is a U channel spot welded to the roof on each side for the
&gt; edge of the wood to sit in. Jammed between the U and the roof was a 1950
10
&gt; pfennig coin!! I believe it was put in when the bus was assembled at
&gt; Westfalia Works.

This one is correct.

&gt; About a month ago, I removed the rear facing single seat from a 69 Westy
and
&gt; found 3 coins. French Francs, a 1, a 10, and a 20...all from the 50's but
I
&gt; believe they fell out of someones pocket.
