Subject: re:Help Me

Engine leaking, parked in backyard, feeling low--
sounds bad, feel for you. Now a hole in the case is
not cause for heart failure, sometimes they can be
pached (JB Weld), but it is very important to clean
the area very good and ruff the area up to have it
stick well. I have pached three so far, two worked
real well, the third weeped oil, must have done
something wrong on it but it was usable. the best pach
is where you can pach from both sides of the case.
tell us where the hole is. Phil
