Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum and timing

John said:

&quot;The manifold vacuum retards your timing whenever the throttle is
closed, whether at idle or if, for example, you let your foot off the
gas after cresting a hill. This is supposed to reduce emissions. Maybe
Richard or some of the others know if there is a corresponding affect
on economy or performance.&quot;  &lt;&lt;- excessive quote alert!!


Thanks, John.  I hope it has a positive effect on performance, particularly 
during warm-up.  I have to let  the '76 get to operating temperature before 
it will idle with confidence.  Maybe this retard addition will have a 
positive effect on the idle.
