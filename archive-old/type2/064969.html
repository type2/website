Subject: 82 stranded: diagnostics

Hi All,

I found time last eve to examine the 82 westie that had to be rescued
from the desert.  It had spark and fuel.  Checked the points dwell and
gap.  The points looked pitted so they were replaced.  Still no go.

Pulled out the compression tester.  My theory in the field was a bad valve
in cylinder #1 as I thought that is where the un-normal noise was
originating.  Cylnder number one had zero compression.  All others had
100.  Although tested cold I believe this verifiys my theory.   Number one
cylinder has a dropped valve or something like that.   Any one have any
other option out there??  

Why wouldn't it run on the other three?.  Not that I would have driven it
home that way but I would think it should at least fire on the other good
cylinders.  I will have to check the heads tonight. 

I guess it is time to call Mark Stephens.  How about a phone number?? 
Should I replace both heads at the same time. That is my inclination.  I
would rather trust it than wonder when the other side is gonna let loose. 
 Also I would have a spare head then.  I assume that the two heads are
not interchangeable.  Is that true?  TIA for all your help.  

At least I didn't tow it all the way home for a simple problem I could have
fixed in the field.
