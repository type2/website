Welcome to the club.  Last year I also replaced all of the below plus a
steering wheel wrecked by the mechanic in the process.  Backing out of garage,
the horn decided to start talking on its own again.  After all the grieve, I
put out a SOS to the the group.  If only I had gone to McDonalds first and
picked up a few extra straws! The straw trick worked for me.  The key is to
send a posting first.  Don't be afraid to ask.
Too many members have &quot;been there, done it&quot;.

&gt; well, after i so-suavely replaced my steering box, coupler and horn wire
&gt; (read all about it in the tech pages on t2_dot_com!), i drove
&gt; the dang thing one block and it began to beep on it's own!  we were going
&gt; up a slight incline; turn signals were on, beeped in rhythm sorta w/ the
&gt; flashers.
&gt; did it again later - slight incline, a turn, but no flashers.. just randumb
&gt; beeps.
&gt;
&gt; my personal hunch is that the steering lock / ignition assembly is buggered
&gt; electrically  and that JUST after i got the thing back on the road, off all
&gt; that dastardly ignition crap has to go. and on a 70, that AIN'T fun.
&gt;
&gt; so.  any less UNPLEASANT fixes i can eliminate first?
