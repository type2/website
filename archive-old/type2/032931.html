Subject: just a reminder

Fellow Busophiles,

As the venerable Mr. Dolan pointed out the other day, folks are joining
the list daily (Thanks for the history, Steve.) and after today I thought
it appropriate to revisit a very familiar subject.

On the way home from church today, I saw a Bus I'd seen parked in the
same place many times. But today was different. This once very nice late
bay was the victim of a major fire. So, once again; replace those fuel
lines, and keep a fire extinguisher where you can get to it. 

A couple of things occurred to me driving home. We did fire drills at
school and we (should) have a fire escape plan at home. Why do we do
these things? Because in an emergency we don't have time to think, we
react to our training (or lack thereof). I'm not suggesting fire drills,
but if we think about what we will do from time to time, (kill the power,
grab the extinguisher, out the door) maybe if the time comes we will save
the few seconds that save the Bus. Also, this Bus got HOT. Tomorrow I'm
stashing a pair of leather work gloves next to the extinguisher. If the
handle is too hot to hang on to, I don't want to be looking for something
to protect my hands.

This subject has been covered in great detail. If you missed it, there is
a wealth of info in the archives. Check it out.

Safe and happy busing,
