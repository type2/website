Greetings everyone, 

I have just joined this list.  I came on this group as I was looking for a wiring diagram on the web.

I'm in the process of restoring my 69 camper.  I bought it during my college days in 1990, and it was my daily driver for 5 years until I started making a decent living and afford a vehicle with AC (florida gets fot in the summer).  So, the bus got parked on the side of the house for a few years, and became an eyesore for the neighbors.

Lately, I'm making good on a promise to myself by fixing her up again.  I stripped her down and got her painted, have installed new window and door rubber, sewn new camper cushions by hand with marine vinyl, Replaced all the wooden interior panels, and have a new, larger engine and tranny sitting in the garage waiting to be installed.

My problem now is with the front-end wiring.  It was always a mess but it worked.  I just pulled a new underbody wiring harness, but the diagram for that does not cover all the relay switches and stuff that I need to put back together.

Does anyone have the haynes manual diagram they can scan and e-mail to me?  I already know how to work on most of my bus, so I hate to go buy a book just for one or two pages of info.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to participating on this list.

John.
