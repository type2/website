&gt;Yup, the light fogging happens on Itch as well. But, the left and middle

Of my six VDO gauges, only one fogs (volt).  The question I always ask
myself is, &quot;Would this be acceptable on a brand new car?&quot;.  If the answer
is no, then there is most likely a problem.  I think fogging points to a
defective gauge.
