Subject: Intake Runner Gaskets

Hello all,

Bus is running, poorly, and I am having a difficult
time locating the gasket between the Intake Runner
tubes and the head.  This is for a 78 Bus, type 4
engine.

The Bus depot, I was unable to locate what I needed,
on the Bus Boys, I was able to locate a part that they
called an intake runner gasket block for $7.00. Can
anyone give me a part number?  Does this sound like
something that I need?  Will I need to replace the
other on that side at the same time?

Advance has something that may work that they list for
$14.99.  I do not want to spend that much.  I will go
and look at it today and see if it is even close to
the part that is needed.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

Mark
