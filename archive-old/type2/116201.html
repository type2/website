Subject: Replacement Engine Fan?

Hey guys,

	Another quick question. I'm trying to go through the entire car and
I noticed that the cooling fan on my motor is missing three teeth. From what
I understand.. the previous owner had the engine rebuilt, but used the older
parts.. so these teeth probably came off a long time ago before this new
motor was installed.

I was wondering if maybe there was some sort of aftermarket &quot;performance&quot;
fan that I could install in place of that.. maybe one that was slightly
better designed the allowed more air to flow? Any idea?



Thanks!
