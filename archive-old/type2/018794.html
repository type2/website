Hello all, hope that things are going well and the weather is not as hot
as it is here. I am removing my engine using Muir (left Wilson at a
friend's house and am waiting to get it back), and have reached a wall.
Chapter 15, step 5: I cannot find the engine mounting nuts. The things
that are supposed to be 4 inches left and right and 2 inches up? Just
one of the many problems I am sure to have =) tia!
