I own a '71 camper, and have a few questions about it. First off, was
it standard for all vans to have a &quot;closet&quot; like storage space besides
the bench seat in the back? It appears as if somebody ripped this closet
right out, I have no idea why. Secondly, do the icebox and the sink come
together as a package, or has there been instances where the icebox is
seperate from the sink.

Thanks,
Brady Balicki
