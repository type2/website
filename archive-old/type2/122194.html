Subject: Seat Stand Mats for Westy

Hello all -
I have been on a search for these mats for my 76 Westy for a little while.
The drivers side is easy to find (Wolfsburg West), but the rotating chair on
the passenger side is quite different from that in this kit.  The top has
two pieces (231 867766 A -- 470 614-1  for the small piece that fits behind
the seat, and 211/231 863 666 B/D/E -- 470 167-7 PXO for the piece around
the door side and down to the front).  I don't have the part number for the
part that wraps around the side.  The only difference between the side piece
I got and the new one is that the new one is too short around the back to be
able to cover the seat stand entirely.

Upon another glance it seems that originally the small piece on the top was 
actually part of the piece that wraps around the side...

I have looked on the site as well as busdepot and gowesty...

Any help would be much appreciated.

Aaron Vanderwerff
'76 Westy
