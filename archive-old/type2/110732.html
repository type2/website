Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

thing
is greg is that i had another tranny in there the original and it did the same thing but not as bad but did get worse on down the road the closer to the time where i couldnt drive her no more.

i put this new /used tranny in and dad gem if it isnt worse now than b4?

not sure if it is aligned right or not but i hope so .
took me forever with the help of another bus owner to mate the engine and tranny.
wished i could get smooth as silk out of 1st as well starting to worry me .
(now when the other tranny was expected to be taken out i did notice that the tranny bolts in top were gone so could that of warped the flywheel?
just curious?
could that also of been what made the sequencers go out in the original transmisson.?
peace
Cha
