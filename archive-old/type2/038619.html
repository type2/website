&gt; 
&gt; my idle is high, fuel mixture is adjusted optimally
&gt; timing is on, clearances are correct.
&gt; i have a small hole in my muffler,
&gt; 
&gt; it runs as though there is a piston slightly off stroke
&gt; until it warms up very good,
&gt; and after a fairly long steady run at 55-60 it 
&gt; dies to almmost stop, and fires back up again for what
&gt; sounds like one cycle. after teh key is off that is.

--&gt; This is probably due to the fast idle.  I know on my van with a
progressive carb, sometimes the throttle would hang up in the
slightly-open position (interference with a choke linkage) and that would
raise the idle to about 1500 rpm.  It would run on at that level, but
never with a more normal idle of 900 rpm.

Run-on happens when the temperature and mixture conditions at shutoff are
just right for the gas to spontaneously combust in a cylinder.  Octane
rating is also a factor.  Unless your engine is running hot or shows other
signs of distress, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  I've never seen
anything that indicated run-on was harmful -- someone can correct me if
I'm wrong.  Your inability to adjust the idle low enough is probably the
real problem.
