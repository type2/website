Subject: Re: [T2] Re:[T2] front mounted tires.

&gt; I don't want to alarm you, but hit a cow at any speed, with or without
&gt; that spare tire on the nose of whatever, and the result will be the big
&gt; hurt !!
&gt; Perhaps that spare prevented that moo-cow from laying in your lap, at
&gt; impact !!!

Yes- before this incident I was under the impression that living bodies
would make for rather elastic collisions, but noooo. Apparently deer also
routinely total cars, though they must weigh hundreds of pounds less than
cows on average. And I've heard that those unfortunate enough to hit a
moose really have a hard time, partly because moose are so tall and
they tend to come in through the windshield even on big tall trucks. Owie.

BTW, the cow in question was a juvenile, maybe 1 year old.
