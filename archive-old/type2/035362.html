Surely this couldn't be it, but you're pretty much beyond the obvious: 8)

Many of the DP manifolds have a vacuum port out to the left side. On that
long tube that the carb mounts to. The conventional way to block this up is
with a piece of gas line with a screw in it. If it were not blocked  you
might have a vacuum leak of a magnitude that could cause your symptoms?

Let's grasp at straws together,
