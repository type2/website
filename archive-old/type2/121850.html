Subject: Custom &amp; Commercial Wheel Lives On in The 909

ListLand-ites:

I bumped into a guy with a WAY KEWL '75 Double Cab out at BBB8 over the
weekend, and was admiring his way kewl 15&quot; steel rims.  And don't ya
know he had them done up at good ol' Custom &amp; Commercial Wheel -
fortunately he had their card in his collection.

I had written up some months back that I had found their card on my
punch board, saved from the early '80s when they were out in the City of
Industry on Valley Blvd.  Their new home is in Fontana, specifically at:

		Custom &amp; Commercial Wheel
		14578 Whittram Ave.
		Fontana, CA  92335
		(909) 357-3505

I didn't get a chance to ask him about how much it cost - but they were
VERY reasonable back then, and I have no reason to doubt that they are
still reasonable now.  I had picked up another clue that they still
might be in existence recently - a close friend of my brother-in-law had
purchased a new but slightly used Class 9 off-road car and it was
sporting brand new &quot;old school&quot; Jackman-style 5 lug white spoke rims
that bore the C&amp;C Wheel stickers...

Chris M. - is that enough material content for ya?  :-)
