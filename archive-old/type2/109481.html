 He contacted
&gt; the owner, Gary, and was told that the wheel cylinders are no longer
&gt; available, but that he replaced the pistons.



Sounds like BS to me. They are available from CIP_dot_com here for $12.95.

I am sure they are available elsewhere also. I dont know why you would only
replace the pistons when it is such a cheap part. I once had a mecanic tell
me that the pistons for my 2.0 were NLA also. I just turned around and
walked away.

Take a copy of that page to this mechanic and then say what he says.

Good Luck
