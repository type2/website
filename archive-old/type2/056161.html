bought a 77 westy yesterday...
joined this list today...

the bus has AC that has been disconnected or something. i can't tell what's going on in there.
Q1: should i get the AC fixed or should i rip it out?

the motor supposedly underwent an extensive rebuild less than 10,000 mi ago.
Q2: why is it having trouble (almost sounds like it's missing) when it's cold and i push it to high RPMs?

possibly related Q3: am i hurting my bus by putting high-octane unleaded in it?

i'm obviously going to need a regular mechanic in dallas...
Q4: does anybody have any recommendations?

thanks in advance...
