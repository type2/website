&gt;Last night our 78 Transporter finally left the driveway on its maiden
voyage with the rebuild of the 2 liter!  We have only &gt;one problem in that
the bus will not idle and stalls if the accelerator is not constantly being
feathered.  Adjustment of
&gt;the idle screw and accelerator cable doesnt solve the problem.  We are
assuming that some sort of vacuum leak could be the&gt; &gt;problem?  The bus is
FI and the EGR valve is still there although nothing is hooked up to it (no
hoses, charcoal filters 
&gt;etc.)  Everything else works great!  Seems like a simple fix or adjustment.
Any suggestions?

Chad,

It took a while for my 2.0L rebuild to idle smoothly.  It's one of those
things you may need to adjust several times over the next couple of weeks or
few hundred miles.  It will take a while for the rings to seat properly and
increase and stabilize the compression and vacuum.  You may also need to
adjust your hyraulic lifters for one last time after a week or so.  My
rebuild now has about 2,000 miles on it and it runs better and better
everyday. In the meantime you should check your hoses for any vacuum leaks,
as you mentioned.  Vacuum leaks are sometimes hard to find, but cause many
many problems if ignored.  I had a vacuum leak at the rubber gasket under
the throttle body.  This was tough to locate but worth the time to find and
fix.  Since your EGR valve is still in place it may be causing a vacuum
leak.  I cut a solid oval shaped gasket from gasket material and installed
it under my EGR valve.  This keeps the EGR valve in place, but seals it from
leaking.  Later on you can simply remove the gasket if you decide to hook up
the EGR valve. Good luck.

Randall and Kermit
