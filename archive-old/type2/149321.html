Subject: Re: [T2] A lesson

I used a grey ribbed rubber type, came in a big roll from Home Depot  
too, about a fingers width wide. Its a nightmare. I don't know if its  
because it was sandwiched down between the body and fiberglass or if  
its the various temperatures it went through, either way I'm NOT  
using it again. I think I will go the foam type route.

&gt; What did you use?  I used the light brown closed cell foam (about  
&gt; 1.25&quot; wide by 1/4&quot; thick from Home Depot to reline a Hyudai trunk  
&gt; and it has never stuck; nor has the same stuff I used to seal the  
&gt; rear hatch on my Westy- it's been on for years.
