Try welding a nut to the stud.

Subject: [T2] Stud removal


&gt; OK, just got a &quot;new&quot; head for the Monkbus, but the
&gt; exhaust studs are broken. I need to get them out. The
&gt; studs are broken 3/4 of the way up and I can only get
&gt; one nut on there, so the double nut method won't work.
&gt; (It worked so well on the ones that I removed from the
&gt; old head.) I have them soaking in penetrating oil right
&gt; now. I have tried vise grips to no avail.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions as to removing them? Heat? I checked the
&gt; archives, but didn't find anything, believe it or not. 
&gt; (Maybe I still need to perfect my search technique.)
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
