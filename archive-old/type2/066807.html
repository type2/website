&gt;bits of plastic in bins... So I bought about 5 yards of the stuff - I
&gt;always buy too much material - some grommets and some of those stick-on
&gt;hooks. Today is going to be 'design the partition' day.

Hi Anton, 

Sounds like a worthy project!  A couple pitfalls I can mention based on
feedback from a local busser who built a plexiglas partition for his '70
nonwalktrhu:  He made a cardboard template for the plexiglas and then simply
used sheetmetal screws with washers and steel brackets to hold the plexiglas
to the sheetmetal.  Since buses are prone to much vibration, the plexiglas
ended up cracking all around the screws.  It's a good idea to insulate any
metal contact with the plexiglas with rubber bumps and grommets (that's
probably what you bought those grommets for anyway).  Also, he complained of
the plexiglas fogging up and causing visibility problems through his
rearview mirror and passenger side blind spot.  He hadn't solved this last
year, but I'd guess you could spray on the &quot;Rain-X&quot; brand Anti-Fog and see
if that works.

Good luck,
Ron
