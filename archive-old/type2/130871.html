Subject: Why are my points closing (sticking)?

Okay Dokey,

My bus self destructed a couple days ago on the way to visit an old VW
mechanic look at a failing brake booster ( the brake booster was leaking
vacuum so I plugged the line with bolt/clamp).

The bus began to lose power and backfire, increasing to the point it sounded
like a machine gun and overheated.

I pulled over and thought it was over, the engine was dead or something bad!
The oil had liquefied and shot out the dipstick.  The engine was smoking and
very very hot.  So I had the bus towed to the VW shop.  The old VW guy called
the next day and said good news the bus is running perfecto and I could pick
it up.  He said the points had stuck closed and he just filed them down,
reinstalled and reset the gap/timing.  He then ran the bus at idle for about
an hour with perfect running and no overheating.

I picked up the bus today and it ran like new!  I've never had so much power
quiet &amp; smooth acceleration.  The VW shop is approx 30 miles from my home.  I
drove at least 20 miles at 60MPH with perfect performance.  About 21 miles
into the trip I got a small backfire and a little loss in power.  By 25 miles
it was backfiring so much I decided to pull over and fix the problem.

There was a huge thunderstorm coming so I parked the bus and decided I would
wait until tomorrow.   I'm not sure why the old VW mechanic didn't replace the
points and condenser rather than just filing down the old points?  While I was
in the city I bought a new condenser and points for a spare.  I want to
install these tomorrow, but I need to know why the points are burning up...

Any help is always and greatly appreciated...  Thanks guys,

Tom
