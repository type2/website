Subject: Re: [T2] DOT 5

&gt;&gt;It had DOT 5 in the system,
though nowhere on the vehicle it stated that it had that
in it. No one gave it a second thought either.&lt;&lt;

DOT 5 can be distinguished from conventional brake fluids by its purple
color, which comes from a dye.  The dye is used to ensure that DOT 3 or 4 is
not mixed with DOT 5.
