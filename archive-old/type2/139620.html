Subject: Re: [T2] The first dropped valve seat

Richard,

Ummmm....overcooled is not so dreamy...LOL....Still having problems with 
my 1776 type1.  On a 50 degree day now, I can't get the oil temps over
176 after driving 75mph on the interstate for 30 minutes.  Oil temps have 
been verified with a separate temp measurement.

For the first time in my life, I have a t1 engine that is making mayonaise 
on the oil filler cap!!!

Planning on triple checking my t-stat this weekend....if it's ok then what 
the heck do I do!!

Gotta admit that I *like* this problem a lot better than the overheat!

Cheers, dave

down the mountain, the head overcooled and the valve seat fell out. This was in 1938!

&gt; Overcooled sounds almost dreamy. :-)
