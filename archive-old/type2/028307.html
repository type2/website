&gt; My mileage, as they say, varied.  They are indeed
&gt; a close fit over the seat frames and are a good product overall, however,
&gt; they are, in my opinion, too much padding for the seat covers to go over.


FWIW, I am now using a different supplier than I did at the time that Greg
got those foam seat pads from me (which was a couple of years ago). I have
not had any complaints about them in the roughly one year that I've been
shipping them.  They do seem to be contoured well for the shape of the
seats, although I couldn't honestly say whether or not they are actually
less padded than the ones Greg got (not having one of the old ones here to
compare them to).
