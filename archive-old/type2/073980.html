Subject: RE: drilled bumpers/aux lights

Hi There!
  I discovered that on my 70 Westy... I have a
pair(two total) on my bumpers. One on each side in
fact.  My 68 has the same set.  I just think of it as
a cool little bonus from VW to put something cool on
my bus.  I have thought of the lights, but still am
not sure what to put on the bumper.  There is a real
nice set at the place I work on clearance for $29! 
Might just do that now that you have me thinking on
it.  :)
  I dunno, how would a hippe looking 68 Westy look
with a pair of halogen driving lights?
