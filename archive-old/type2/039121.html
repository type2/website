Volkswagen recommends GL4 and GL4 alone in their service manual. read it,
if you find a reference saying GL5 is appropriate please let me know.

read this faq:

If you still have doubts, call Long Tansaxle and ask them if they offer a
warranty on any VW transaxle filled with other than GL4 lube.  Ask why.

Really, everyone insisting its okay to use whatever the hot lube is with
the kiddies this month sounds more like &quot;mechanics folklore&quot; to me than
using what volkswagen specified in the shop manual, but its your
transmission do whatever you want.  What racers do has little bearing on
what I do... how many of those guys are running stock transaxles.  Not
many i'd bet. (many drag racers run no cooling fan, do you hear anyone
recommending that for your bus?)

To put it in a nutshell, API-GL5 exceeds pressure resistance specs for
GL4, but the extra additives used to do this are corrosive to volkswagen
syncros. Since a VW transmission has no hypoid gears, there is no need for
the extra pressure resistance, it is wasted.  the negative of corroding
syncros to me oughtweighs any benifit i might get from an un-needed jump
in pressure resistance.

have fun,

Steve
