most likely you have a bad mist valve. The valve is NLA so you have to
replace the entire wiper switch.

Subject: [T2] Wiper Juice coming out my Steering Wheel.


&gt;
&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I tried to get my wiper juice working for the first time, and when I
&gt; pressurized it, juice started coming out of the steering wheel.  Is this
&gt; normally wired this way?  Has anybody else had this problem?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help on this issue.
