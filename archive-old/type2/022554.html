Subject: charging system troubles still

Hi,
	I have posted at least three questions and I want to thank the people that
have responded, but I still have the same problem. Changed the voltage
regulator with a 30 amp to match the generator, checked all wires again for
corrosion, checked for a short which I realized when my front door is
opened their is still juice going to the switch without the light on.
Anyway closed the door and no short. I checked all the connections at the
starter, and gen again for the 8th time, and polarized the battery to the
generator. Still when I pull the negative cable off the battery at about
1900 rpm the engine dies!!!! I checked the D+ terminal at the gen and
getting about 14 volts, I also checked the battery terminal on the
regulator and also about 14 volts. New battery, and gen has only about 100
miles on it. I think this problem started when PO had new wiring harness
installed and system has been running off the battery ever since.  Please
help! The dorm mobile days are starting to number and I fear for its
existence.

Thanks,
Paul
