Arvid:

I would not overlook the possibility that the light coming on is not
indicative of an electrical problem, but something else.

Your idle speed may be set too low, or you may have a vacuum leak that
is causing the engine to stumble and die at idle.

The fact that the battery is weathering this behaviour without going
completely flat suggests that it is being adequately maintained by the
charging system.
