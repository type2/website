Tesa,
This is far too simple to fix to let it go.  There is a metal venting tube
that runs the perimiter of your engine compartment.  Open the engine hatch
and feel around behind the spare tire well where the tube runs.  You should
feel an old rotten and torn piece of rubber fuel hose that connects two
pieces of this metal tubing.  Use a new piece of fuel line about 3-4 inches
long and replace this connector piece.  You may have to cut the old piece
off witha sharp knife or razor.  You can use a small amount of grease,
anything except Vaseline, to lubricate the tubes and new piece of fuel line.
This will make it easier to slide onto the tubes.  The biggest problem with
this repair is you have to do everything without being able to see what you
are doing because it is inside the engine compartment and behind the spare
tire well.  There are several other connector pieces thoughout this metal
tubing maze, but you need to fix this particular one ASAP.  Good luck.

so i noticed that when i add gas a small puddle of
fuel forms under the the passenger side rear tire. i
still have half of tank of gas in there so it doesn't
seem to leak once the gas is in the tank only when
it's on the way to the tank. 1) am i right in assuming
that it's the pipe/tube thingy which delivers the fuel
to the tank that is leaking? 2) how do i check such a
thing? besides the fire factor, i can't afford to
waste gas with these california prices.


have a great day,

tesa
