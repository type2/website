Subject: Westy for Sale in Montana - Part 3
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Volks, here goes again,

Apparently the original ad got screened out because I mentioned the seller 
had tried to sell it on an online auction, but the address for the photos got 
through becauce I didn't mention the auction.  Here's his ad again, without 
any mention of that certain online auction place.  Please contact him, not 
me, for further information.  The seller says the photos can be found as 
follows:

My photos are permanently lodged on &lt;http://photopoint_dot_com/&gt;  .  Simply 
access that website.  In the box for &quot;Username/Email,&quot; type troe_at_imt_dot_net  .  
In the box for &quot;Password,&quot; type   47864.  Hit Enter.   On the Album List that 
appears, click on VW Camper.  

Here's the details.  Remember, contact him, not me. 

AVAILABLE: 1978 Westphalia camper in very good to excellent condition.  Owner 
is retiring to Montana -- and from mobile camping -- and is reluctantly 
selling great restoration vehicle.  If buyer is willing to pick up vehicle, 
seller will include a
&quot;Montana vacation package,&quot; -- i.e., a home base here from which to tour the 
State.  If not, delivery is negotiable, depending on eventual selling price.  
Camper is in good to excellent condition throughout, except where noted 
below. Original Porsche engine has 63,900 miles.  Owner uses only Mobil 1 
synthetic oil, does not run engine above 3,000 rpm and hence can promise an 
engine in excellent condition.  Vehicle runs and cruises beautifully.  All 
equipment original except new Bosch fuel
pump.  Vehicle comes with table, child's hammock, water tank and working 
pump, ice box, interior spare tire slot with spare, two new unmounted tires, 
rear light truck tires, rear door mosquito screen, etc.  Owner added highly 
effective stereo sound
system, equalizer, intermittent wiper, bar tachometer, in-line heater 
booster, compass, nose cover, etc.  Very solid body.  Minor rust on lower 
edges of front doors and on steel wheels from sitting outside on humid East 
Coast.  Rust, barely visible, under right-rear reflector from minor collision 
(delivery vehicle operator opened his rear door just as I was backing down an 
alley!).  Vehicle does have its flaws, the bulk of which are cosmetic.  Needs 
new upholstery for front seats, new headliner, new carpeting, new outside 
rear-view mirrors, touchups.  Serious restorer would probably wish to replace 
windshield and gasket. Owner knows of nearly identical vehicle that sold last 
year on East Coast for $6,500 and has seen others advertised for asmuch as 
$8,500.  This one is being advertised for $4,500 and, hopefully, a quick 
sale.  If interested, please contact Teddy Roe at &lt;troe_at_imt_dot_net&gt; or call at 
406-256-7201.  Serious inquiries, please.
