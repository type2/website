Ok, my car today was totaled by my girlfriends sister.  An 1985 Ford
LTD.  It was rolled and treed so its all done.  Shes OK----

So, i need to get my 72 on the road pronto.  My question is how much
should I get a loan for to cover an engine (1700cc), a tranny, cv
shafts, clutch, and miscellaneous stuff that i need for a complete
mechanical resto.  Is $4000 way under budget.  Any help/ and or input
would be great.  PS- whats the best and cheapest way to get a good
engine- send mine out to be rebuilt or go through a company like AVP or
GEX.  Anyone know any good suppliers?

Thanks
Merry XMAS
Matt
