To start with, we live at the end of 5 miles of bad, unpaved, rutted, muddy 
road...so things tend to shake loose.  Yesterday the bus (83 vanagon) 
started to make a new funny noise. Remember when you were 6 years old and 
used clothes pins to attach playing cards to your bicycle so the wheel 
spokes would make noise?  That's the noise the bus started to make. Upon 
opening the engine compartment, it appears to be coming from the area of the 
fan shroud.  Any quick check ideas before I have to go out in the snow and 
start pulling things off? What should I be looking for?
Thanks.
