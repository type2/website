Hey Everybdy,

  Fist I just want to say thanks for all the replies from my NO keys post. I 
took a handle to the locksmith and made keys, but to my dismay It still 
won't work the ignition. No I am faced with the delema of removing the 
ignition switch. Does anyone have any pointers on how to do this. My manual 
says start by removing the steering wheel but I am not sure how to go about 
doing that. Any help would be apreciated.

Also if there is anyone from the Newark, Delaware area on this list that 
would be willing to lend a hand please sent me an email.

Cheers,

Joe
