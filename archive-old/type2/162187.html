Subject: Re: [T2] CHT  -  again

Hi Robt,

Have  look at the installation guide found at www.germansupply_dot_com.  
That installation looks like it would make spark plug changes a lot  
less trouble and you still get to use the standard install location  
so as to maintain consistency on the readings.


Happy Trails,

&gt; 	Whether one goes for a single reading point, as in the std VDO  
&gt; CHT, or 2 reading points using a simple switch between two  
&gt; thermocouples to read on just the one gauge at will, or the full  
&gt; quad gauge with 4 reading points, the question remains where to put  
&gt; the k-thermocouple(s).
