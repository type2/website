Subject: Calculated CR's.  Whats good??

Hi everyone,
Installed the 26mm oil pump along with the Berg pressure relief full
flow cover.  I also took out the old 8mm studs and put in new ones.
The new studs were coated with case sealant and seem to go in tighter.
The washers and nuts were also coated with sealant, so hopefully no oil
leaks.
I was also able to measure deck height on all 4 cylinders yesterday.
#1   .053
#2   .051
#3   .047
#4   .049

I used the tool with the heavy metal plate and screw and some dial
calipers.  Along with my chamber vol. of #1 (48.8 cc) #2(48.9),#3(49.1)
#4(48.8) I computed CR at 8.00:1 (#1 &amp; #2)  and  8.1:1 (#3 &amp; #4).

With .060 shims that comes out to a nice 7.1:1 all around.  I can live
with that.  Anybody think it should be lower?  .080 shims would drop it
to about 6.8:1.  .070 would be somewhere in between.  

I can get .060's on Monday,  anything else will have to be a special
order.  If I  go custom, maybe .080's on 3 &amp; 4 and .070's on 1 &amp; 2.

By the way, my end play had a final measurement of .002 just .001 under
spec.  Is that cool??
Received some advice to use high temp silicone on the case to cylinder
base surface.  Very thin bead.  Sounds right to me.
Well, the rest of today I'll work on the interior panels. Mine are in 
decent shape.  I was going to put some Thompsons on the backsides and
clear urathane semigloss on the front.

Have a great Sunday afternoon.
