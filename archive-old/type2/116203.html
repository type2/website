Subject: VW Die Cast

Hey guys,

	Does anyone know where I can get ahold of a diecast Volkswagen
Transporter? I'd like to find one that resembles my car as much as possible.
I have a 1973 Bus with the windows (not the panel van). I also don't have
the camper top, or the sunroof.

Anyone know where I can get one? I'd like one that's about the size of a
regular house brick (dunno what scale that is).


Thanks,
