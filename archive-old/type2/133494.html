&gt; &gt; so with lots of people calling the Type IV engine a Porsche engine, when
&gt; &gt; really isn't, how do you easily tell if you really have a Porsche engine
&gt; &gt; Type IV engine

&gt; All Porsche 914 engines have a vertical dipstick located next to the
&gt; breather box.

but so do many of the real Type IV VW's
