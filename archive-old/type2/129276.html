Yeah, that would definately suck.  Maybe I'll look for a 75 and 
transplant everything in there.  Isn't the 75 just like the 76-79 models?

&gt; This bill is now in commitee in the Senate and an important vote is apparently tomorrow. In a nutshell the rolling smog exemption will be frozen at 75-older vehicles effective Jan 1, 2005. If you have a 76-79 bus (these model years are wonderful) you will probably have to smog it forever unless some relief comes in the form of a future bill. Personally I will be moving out of California on principle to a car hobby friendly state if this law is enacted.
