Subject: GoWesty service/rubber glues

Hey y'all

Cruising the net the other day I found the GoWesty Store.

There I found the wraparound seat pedestal pair of rubber things for 29.95! 10 bucks less than Wolfsburg, their supplier. I think it was a return or something, but I ordered friday, had them yesterday, and they are perfect.

Good service from some central california coast folks (los osos).

Just wanted to give them a thumbs up on this one.

Now....What kind of glue to put them on?
I have repainted my seat pedestals with the rattle can. Will anything stick the rubber to them now?

Billy
