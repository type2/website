Subject: Re: [T2] oil light came on!!

Hi Mat,

If you commonly drive the bus short distances it is possible that your 
oil has been contaminated with fuel. Take a sniff, and if it smells 
like gas then dump it (in an eco-friendly manner) and replace it with 
fresh oil and a new filter. Drastically reduce your oil inspection 
period until you determine that the problem isn't cming back. If it 
does come back, start looking at the FI gear, and save up your $$$ for 
a rebuild...

Another possibility is the sender wire of the oil pressure switch. Bare 
spots on this wire can ground against the engine tin or the distributor 
and this will cause the light to flicker as you describe. This happened 
to me on the way back from John Brown's buses. At first I 
mis-identified it as a hot idle low pressure problem because it would 
go away as soon as I brought the revs up. Some electrical tape on the 
wire and things are much better now.

Happy trails,

&gt; Soon as I started up and backed out, the oil light flickered on. 
&gt; Stopped, checked the oil - it was just below the lower line on the 
&gt; dipstick, so I added about 3/4 qt and went on my way. I noticed the 
&gt; light flickering on during turns and starting from a stop. It'd 
&gt; flicker 2 or 3 times and go off. No leaks under the bus while I was at 
&gt; work. Tonight, onthe way home, the light came on a bit more 
&gt; frequently. I stopped, checked the oil, checked the bottom - no 
&gt; obvious leaks, no nasty burning smell.
