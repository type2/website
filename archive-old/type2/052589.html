What imaginary about shore line?  A shore line is a line taken from the
stern of an anchored boat to a point on shore, usually in a crowded
anchorage, to prevent the boat from swinging and fouling other boats.  Also
called a stern line.  Around here, where yachting is very popular, I've
seen as many as 100 boats moored in a cove, each within 10 feet of his
neighbour, held by shore lines.
