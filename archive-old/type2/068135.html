'68-'72 Gold Vinyl camper upholstery
        ice box no sink behind passenger seat -'71
        ice box/sink passenger side '72 + '73

        '73 only Gold/Butterscotch Burlap type cloth camper upholstery

        '74-'76 started with color co-ordinated plaids
        
        Deluxe campers had Fridge/stove beind pass seat with sink/storage
behind driver
        Non-Deluxe had icebox instead of fridge, and no stove..

        '77-'79 had camper console along wall behind driver

        Deluxe had fridge and propane stove..and sink
        Non-Deluxe had icebox and sink ...

        all years after '74 had somewhat color co-ordinated plaid camper
upholstery...

        Just looked at a Non-deluxe '75 camper Orange exterior with a
interesting tan and burnt orange plaid inside.. (I've never seen this
plaid before, I kinda liked it...) this was for sale here in NH for
$2000 body was Very Very clean... minimal surface rust...

        this may not be 100%, but it is pretty close...
