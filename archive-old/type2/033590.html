&gt;Volks,
&gt;  I have a question regarding the VDO Cylinder temp sensor and gague. First
&gt;I have a '79 2.0L FI w/CA emissions. I put the heat sensor on my #3 spark
&gt;plug. My temp readings are 350 deg with no load doing about 60MPH as I
&gt;increase to 70-75 mph the temp goes up to about 425 deg but as soon I slow
&gt;down the temp goes down..(thats the good part).

Doesn't sound excessive to me.

&gt;My real question is when I
&gt;installed the sensor I hooked up the (heat sensor wire) the to wires going
&gt;to the gague, but I ran out of wire so I added about 2-3 feet of wire to
the
&gt;orignal wire that came with the VDO gague. Will adding this wire give me
&gt;false readings??

If you add it at the gauge end, it shouldn't change the readings
appreciably as long as there is no resistance in the wire you added.

&gt;I don't know why it runs hot...the motor is rebulit, new
&gt;air box, and runs great. I have all the cooling tin in place, heater hoses
&gt;in place. I have been told the motor should not get above 400 espically
when
&gt;putting a load on it. Any informaion will be greatly appreciated.

I think others have posted similar temps, which is why I said it doesn't
sound excessive.  What are your oil temps?  That would tell you something
about whether your engine is really running hot or not.

Since you have a FI motor with catalyst, you might also check that your cat
is not plugged, and that you are not running lean (check the spark plugs).
