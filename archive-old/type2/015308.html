&gt;&gt; I just recently purchased a '77 bus with a 2.0liter fuel injection.  The
bus
&gt;&gt; had been sitting for 3 months.  Anyway the bus was in good physical shape
&gt;&gt; and the price was good.  I am wondering what things I need to check
before I
&gt;&gt; even begin to try to start this motor up?

Everthing on the maintenance schedule that is determined due by a review
of the DOCUMENTED history of the vehicle and everything that is undocumented.
Of course, it is better to do this before negotiating purchase.
