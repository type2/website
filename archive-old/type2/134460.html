Subject: Re: [T2] upper bunk for a 73 westy?

----- Original Message -----

&gt; I ran across this ad.
&gt; http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=119376 I emailed the
&gt; seller and they said that it was indeed for a 73. I thought I was pretty sure
&gt; that the 73 never came out with a foam bed for the upper bunk, but maybe I am
&gt; wrong. Can anyone verify if this is an option on a 73 or if this setup would
&gt; work in my 73?

Corbett
my guess is No.
I am not an expert on the upper bunks... but that sure looks like what *I* would
call a '74 upper bed

I think the way to tell them apart for sure would be to ask the vendor if the
top pop with the front up. and the roof rack on the front . I think that is the
bed your looking at.

If the top pops with the rear up and the roof rack on the rear would be what
your looking for *I* think
If your bus has the rear pop.. then the front pop style bed will not fit,,
unlless you want to swap the entire fibreglass to the rain gutter top
clip.........

With all the home made changes over the years,, it is possible for a early
&lt;1973&gt; Bus to have a late &lt;1974&gt; style roof installed to make it a UberWestfakia

Ask the famous Greg Potts,, or the infamous NcBus whom I believe invented
WestfaKia
