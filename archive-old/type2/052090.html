Subject: [T2] New carb question, 70 camper

I am replacing my carb with a brand new one from Bus Depot for my Bus. 
However, my question is this: My '70 engine is a dual-port with a &quot;30/31 
Pict&quot; carb and am wondering if there will be any problems with changing to 
the 34-Pict-3 carb the Depot is selling?

Thanks
will
