Subject: Steering knuckle replacement q's 

So now I have the old rotted beam out, and I'm transferring the '71 
steering knuckles and wheels onto the fresh '78 beam (thanks again 
Bill)with ball joints already on.  I'm assuming I should put the new 
beam back on without the knuckles, and then use a floor jack to 
compress the bottom ball joints and arms up enough so the knuckles will 
get nice and snug.

Am I correct?

TIA

-Don
