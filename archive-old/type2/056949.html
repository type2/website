	I am in the process of replacing the passenger side
window in my '78 Westfalia, this has turned out to be more difficult than I
anticipated. Although there is a large gap
for the window on the inside of the door, I cannot seem to be able to slide
it right inside and up. I am also afraid 
that excessive force may crack the window. Any ssuggestions would be
greatly appreciated.
