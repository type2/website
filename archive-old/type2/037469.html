Subject: Help! '76 FI problems

I need a fuel injection guru! Okay, here's the scenario. One day I
needed to go into town so I hopped into my '76 westy and fired her up.
Bummer,  not enough gas to go where I needed so I took my '78 ASI
instead. Two days later I go to fire up the '76 again and it just fires
for a second then dies. Okay, I check the usual e.g.: spark, spark
intensity, points, cap, rotor, condenser, voltages and resistance
values, fuel pressure (with a gauge too), fuel filter, fuel pump
operation, loose vacuum lines and loose grounds. Every thing checks ok.
Next I start swapping in new (or operational) parts like another air
box, fuel double relay, ballast resister, coil, ECM, main harness
(albeit from a '78), head temp sender, double check voltage at the ECM
and check voltage at the injector connects (12.3 V) during crank. Still
nothing. Next I pulled two injectors out (still hooked up) and cranked.
No fuel sprayed from the exposed injectors. The cold start injector will
still fire the engine momentarily, but it won't run.
Brothers (and Sisters) please help! The bus isn't as fun stuck in the
driveway! Thanks in advance.
