Hi Volks!

All is going pretty well with Karma's restoration (68 Microbus), but today
when I was bleeding the brakes, I snapped the bleeder valve off the first
wheel..........moved on to the other 3 and didn't have any problems.....no
air in the lines now and fluid didn't come out of the broken valve.....so
what do I do about the broken valve???  new wheel cylinder?  PLEASE HELP
KARMA, she is almost road legal!
TIA

Chance and Amy
68 Bus **Karma**   ...... (good karma :-})
