Subject: Re: Book with buying advice?

&gt;The  &quot;VW BUS Custom Handbook&quot;  sounds as if it might be what I'm after or
&gt;would &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive&quot; be a better bet?

I don't know what the _VW Bus Custom Handbook_ is. I wouldn't recommend the
Idiot Book (the second one) for this particular purpose, though. First
place, the buying advice re busses is for splits and much of the knowledge
you seek is generation-specific.

Second place, I just plain object to some of the nonsense in the Idiot
Book. In order to decide whether the bus is worth it, you're supposed to
&quot;grok&quot; the bus, where &quot;grok&quot; means &quot;to think without thinking.&quot; What a load
of crap. You better think *while* thinking, I say.

And there's all this emphasis on wheel bearings and CVs and suchlike.
Brakes. Spend the time you would have spent wiggling the wheels and
grokking, and do a compression check instead. See whether the brake booster
is hooked up (if it has one) because if it isn't hooked up, it probably
doesn't work, and it's worth about four wheel bearings and two CVs and a
rebuilt carb put together, once you spend the time tracking it down.

And don't kid yourself about rust. Cancer like a silence grows...

That doesn't mean the Idiot Book is not worthwhile, it is. But your best
sources of information when buying a bus are experience and the list. I
don't think there's any book that will help you all that much. Busses are
*different* from normal cars. ;)
