X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Volks,

Well, what a horrible day!  

First, the virus... The list software is *supposed* to bounce any encoded
attachments, which this virus got around by sending a new mail with itself
as the body :-( I have put a filter in place that *should* catch this in
case it ever happens again, but this is still the internet and there's
always a new trick around the corner :-(

Second, to those who caught it and sent warnings, thank you.

Third, the unfortunate post by e. on his love life...  He's gone.  I don't
know what to say other than I am sorry.  *Almost* anyone can subscribe,
and until they post, I have nothing more than the address to go by.
Because something is wrong with the mechanism that is supposed to send the
charter to new subscribers, I have been talked into cutting people a bit
more slack than usual, and I have been.  In addition, I prefer not to
embarrass anyone in public if I can help it.  I don't *like* being an
ogre!  But if it takes me being an ogre, I guess I gotta :-(  

Last (for this post), if something like this does happen, write to me,
write to Ken, write to Thom.  Don't write to the list!  The administrative
addresses are:

ME             dworkin_at_ari_dot_net
               list-admin_at_type2_dot_com

Thom           thom_at_calweb_dot_com

Ken            bighouse_at_bellsouth_dot_net
               bighouse_at_type2_dot_com

I know a woman... became a wife 
These are the very words she uses to describe her life 
She said a good day ain't got no rain 
She said a bad day's when I lie in the bed 
And I think of things that might have been
