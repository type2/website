Subject: Re: valve adjustment techniques

Volks,
On the FI engine the safety screen would have to be removed to rotate the 
crankshaft with a wrench. So my alternative has been to put the van in 4th 
gear, on a level surface, and roll it backwards, adjusting in 4 steps.
Anything unsafe about that, since we can reach the valves, albeit with some 
puffing, without any jacking?
Also, about the two-step adjust formula, that's the first time I've heard 
that idea. Are you sure that the adjustment will be as accurate as the 
4-step? I got the impression that the engineers thought the cam location for 
the &quot;extra&quot; valves to be adjusted via that procedure  might not be in the 
same position as if the cylinder were at true TDC.
