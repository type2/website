Subject: HELP!! can't get in or out of gear!

Dear All,

I have got a little emergency on my hands:
The 1979 2L Devon Moonraker of a friend of mine who is staying over here in
London was driving fine up to now and since last night has difficulty
selecting gears.
At traffic lights it is impossible to get the car into anygear at all apart
from reverse which gives a horrible noise from the gearbox. After that it
is then possible to get into all the gears again until the next stop at a
traffic light.

We managed to get gome from central London last night and trying to get
back in to fist gear  while the bus was till rolling seemed to make it a
bit easier.

So far it was possible to take the car out of gear but getting it back in
was difficult. Since this morning it has started to be increasingly
difficult to even get the car ou;t of great and disengadging the clutch.
i.e. engine stalles at traffic lights since the clutch does not fully
disengaged.


I am lost!!!
whats wrong? clutch? through out bearing, gearbox???

Where do I start?


If you reply to the list please also send a pmail since I am on digest at
the moment!

Thanks a lot,


Lukas
