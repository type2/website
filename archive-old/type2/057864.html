Subject: Re: to cool-tin, or too-cool tin?

I may be wrong... but it doesn't really surprise me that cylinder
temperatures remained the same... I assume the test accounted for
different driving conditions in the interest of accuracy. The cool tins
also need to be on there tightly, secured with safety wire, for them to
work properly. If it was one of the VW rags that did the test, the odds
point to them merely snapping the cool tins up onto the studs and using
no safety wire at all.
	Just for the design of it, I would think that the cylinder temp would
remain the same, while the heads would get the benefit of more air...
and run a bit cooler, maybe, since it appears the cool tins provide an
increased amount of resistance to air flow, compared to the stock
deflectors. At the very least it seems that the region of the cylinders
would be cooled a little more evenly.
	Adapting the lower tin should not be done with a hammer, IMHO, although
it *can* be done that way. It is much better to cut along the lines of
the semi-geometric dimples, using a little common sense as to the choice
of cuts, and then to fold the pieces out, in effect &quot;reversing&quot; the
dimple. MIG welding then closes the cuts back up.
	Then again, stock upright motors with stock tin have earned their keep
in the realm of longevity. I don't think it's bad to have all-stock
tinware... but I suspect that cool-tins when properly attached may be
just a teensy bit better.

My opinions...

&gt; Apparently, the results showed that the cool tins did not lower
&gt; cylinder temperatures when compared to the stock tin pieces.
&gt; Considering that you have to bang up your existing tin to install the
&gt; cool tin, I don't think that it is such a good idea on a type 1 engine.
