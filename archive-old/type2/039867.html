Subject: Re: Canvas Installation

&gt;Addendum (I posted to the list first)....I can get stainless steel
&gt;staples (Arrow) only in 3/8&quot; at home depot- did you use stainless or
&gt;regular??  I agree that stapling 3/8 through both the canvas and strip
&gt;is a lot for 3/8&quot;- BTW, did you have to staple through that trim piping
&gt;on the BUS DEPOT canvas, or did it stick out below the plastic strip??

Regular...I never even thought of stainless, that's a good idea, wish I'd 
thought about it. I was stapling through the trim piping, otherwise a 3/8&quot; 
staple would have worked well. Did I say how happy I am to be finished with 
that job?
