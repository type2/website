Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot Heads

&gt; Ron,
&gt; Sorry to chime in on this one BUT....
&gt; 
&gt; In my experience,
&gt;  AVP will not send out your core refund until you call and
&gt; remind them. Sometimes several times.
&gt; 
&gt; I had to send back 2 heads recently because they forgot to
&gt; test the studs and I had at least one on each head pull out. 
&gt; They admitted it was their mistake.  I had to call and call 
&gt; and call to get my refund on the shipping and had to park my 
&gt; bus while I waited and waited for the heads to come back. On 
&gt; the 3rd head I had go bad, I finally told them no more and 
&gt; they agreed to pay a local machine shop to fix the stud.  
&gt; Which again the reimbursement took way too long and I had to 
&gt; call again and again.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't mind having to drop your engine several times
&gt; and parking your bus for undisclosed periods of time while 
&gt; waiting for replacements and you have the extra $ that you 
&gt; don't mind spending on trying to get your heads back to them 
&gt; and waiting for your refund.
&gt; 
&gt; Go ahead with AVP.


Snoopy,

Your post led me to call Erin at AVP to find out about the situation, as
this seems completely unlike them. Without placing blame in either
direction, I wanted to report their take on the situation, as it may
present a balanced view, and actually reinforces my point about AVP's
level of customer service.

Erin explained that they have a special jig that they use to test the
head studs, and any that show any sign of pulling or crossthreading when
tightened to factory spec are immediately replaced. While this does not
100% assure that a stud will not pull out, it's a reasonable test. Even
a new stud can be defective, but if the stud meets factory specs it is
safe to assume that it is good. We have not had any problems in general
with studs pulling out of AVP heads, so this assumption seems to be
true. Yes, we do hear of an odd one here or there, but extremely few and
far between.

What is far more common is that a head stud pulls out because it was
overtightened. The factory spec for head stud torque is only 17 lbs as I
recall, and many torque wrenches don't even read that low. As a result,
many people just tighten them &quot;by feel,&quot; which is a mistake because a
reasonably strong person can easily torque more than that without even
meaning to. This can cause even a brand new stud to pull out.

So you got two heads and each had a stud pull out. There are two
possible explanations for this. One is that AVP forgot to check the
studs on two heads that week, and you happened to get both of them. An
incredible stroke of bad luck on your part, yet certainly not
impossible. The other is that you (or your mechanic) overtorqued the
studs during assembly. Erin asked you if you'd used a torque wrench when
installing the heads. When you replied that you had not overtorqued the
heads, she immediately took complete responsibility for the failure
without any further question or hassle, and replaced both heads. This is
consistent with my experience with AVP. When there is any doubt at all,
they err on the side of the customer. 

Then when you got the replacement heads, you reported that one head stud
was stripped. At this point, Erin is _positive_ that they all tested
well, since given the past problem they were painstaking about testing
the heads they sent you. Erin has some guesses as to possible
explanations, but they're just guesses and she was the first to say so.
But the point is that once again AVP took full responsibility, and, to
avoid any further delay on your end, actually reimbursed your mechanic's
fees and let you just have him replace the stud. 

As for core refunds, they come from us, not AVP, assuming you bought the
engine through us. With regard to the $35 reimbursement check AVP sent
you for your mechanic's labor, Erin says she ended up paying $15 to
overnight it to you because she had originally addressed the envelope
wrong and it was returned undelivered. Her fault. She said that when she
overnighted you the check, she actually included the returned envelope
with the post office markings just in case you doubted this.

I do concur that AVP can be hard to reach by phone sometimes. They're a
small family run shop and will often put the answering machine on if
they're both busy. It can be necessary to call several times before you
reach them. I've never had trouble getting through eventually but
sometimes it has taken two or three tries throughout the day. If you
bought the engine or head from us, and are having trouble reaching AVP,
let us know and we'll make sure to get them in touch with you promptly.
We're in pretty frequent contact with them and can have them call you if
you can't reach them.

Engines, heads, and transmissions can be difficult items to warranty,
because there are so many factors that can cause failure that are beyond
the rebuilder's control. On  one extreme, the engine can be installed
perfectly - every bolt is tightened to factory torque, the valves
adjusted properly, the timing spot-on, and the bus driven gently during
break-in - but the engine is simply defective. On the other extreme, the
engine can be installed by a total idiot (not talking about you here,
Snoopy), who doesn't bother with cooling tin, adjusts the valves wrong
(or not at all), times the engine wrong, hooks up the injectors wrong so
it's running on three cylinders, and then drives it that way until the
engine finally says &quot;no more&quot; and self-destructs.  In both cases the
customer will be 100% convinced that the engine failure was not their
fault - usually due to sheer ignorance rather than malice. In extreme
cases like this it's pretty easy to tell the difference. But many cases
are somewhere in between - a gray area. It is in those cases where I've
always seen AVP err toward the side of customer satisfaction. Sometimes
even in cases where frankly I wouldn't have, because the signs of
serious abuse were completely obvious. By comparison, most rebuilders
I've had the displeasure of dealing with look for any excuse NOT to
honor their warranty. If the signs point toward the simple likelihood of
user abuse or external causes of the damage, that's all they need; they
flatly deny warranty coverage. And in fact, most will void the engine
warranty completely if the heat tab (that's supposed to fall off at a
certain temperature) isn't present when the engine fails. My first
rebuilt bus engine (pre-Bus-Depot) was a GEX. (Yeah, I know.) The heat
tab fell off as soon as I started the engine.   

So, Snoopy, I'm not trying to debate what happened, and please don't
view this as an attack or as casting aspersions on you (or your mechanic
if there was one). There's no way for any of us to really know for sure
if the human error was on their part or yours, and I certainly do
understand your frustration. My point is that given that situation, AVP
immediately took full responsibility for it, whereas many rebuilders
wouldn't have. In fact, AVP's handling of this situation exemplifies the
very reason why I like doing business with them. That and the fact that
we rarely have a warranty issue of any sort with their products to begin
with. They do good work, and they stand behind it.
