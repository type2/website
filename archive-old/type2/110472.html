&lt;&lt; All in all, it was a fun time to be young, and fun to revisit via music, 
the
 Grateful Dead concerts, Rainbow Tribe gatherings, and so on. &gt;&gt;

I guess the point I was trying to make was that they were there in the 
1960's, Ithey were at the colleges I attended in the 80's and I still see 
them today.

They tend to be young, into music, at concerts by musicians I know nothing 
about and still finding their way to Rainbow Tribe gatherings based on the 
folks I saw heading into Montana's Bighole valley a few summers ago (many in 
VW buses).

....seems that not a lot has changed, escept for_our_age and attitude.  ; )
