Subject: RE: [T2] Motor diesels when I shut it off...

Oops, sorry.

	The motor is a 1.8 liter motor.. probably from a mid 70s? Mine in
particular is a 73 VW Bus. This particular motor is powered by an electric
fuel pump, with the 2-bbl Webber carburetor.. the one with those four LONG U
shaped runners.

I assumed the question was general enough.


Thanks!

&gt;I've discovered that after driving the Bus in hot weather (like during the

&gt;the motor will diesel when I shut it off. It's usually no more than one

&gt;up to 5 engine rotations. What causes this, and how can I prevent it.

What engine?  What carburetor?  Fuel injected?  Give us some info fer 
chrissakes!
