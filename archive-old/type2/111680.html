 &gt; Easiest way to check ignition system is with a simple test light. First
 &gt; check + side like you did. Then have someone crank the engine over while
 &gt; you put your testlight on the - side. If points are working the test light
 &gt; will blink. No blinks no spark. Hands still clean go to Flaps replace
 &gt; points... Of course your coil could go bad as well but its not very often.
 &gt; Your points are what fire your coil so if you have blinks and no spark then
 &gt; it is your coil.

Yah, did that this morning.  Light blinks as expected, so points/condensor
are at least minimally functional.

I think I'm going to borrow a spare-but-working coil, put it in, and see
if that improves anything.  If so, then I'll order a new coil, if not.. well,
I guess I'll have to keep hunting (great).

Thanks for everyone's help so far!
