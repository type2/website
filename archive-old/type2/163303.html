Bob -

A distributor (NEW) will set you back a cool $550 according to Bosch's
latest price (2 are available from Bosch's warehouse in California).  A
local rebuilt will probably run around $100 exchange, give or take.

The vacuum unit can be purchased separately, such as thru Bus Depot for $50
(Bosch # 07 060, VW # 021 905 271 F)
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021905271F

But you can probably source the vacuum unit locally at a
Kragens/Shucks/Checker/AutoZone/AdvanceAuto, etc., for most likely less
under a Wells Brand part number, of which escapes me at the moment (I failed
to enter the # in my database when I last saw it).  Richard Atwell has
mentioned it before, but I can't find it on his site at the moment.

&gt; well I think I found the problem with my 78.  the dist diaphram must have
&gt; a small hole. it will pull the advance plate maybe halfway then slowly goes
&gt; back to start even if the vacuum is held..
&gt; ??? anyone sell diaphrams??
&gt; or distributors for a 78 auto tranny stock.???
&gt; being typically bus driver cheap just the diaphram would be preferred but
&gt; whatever.  gots lots of stuff I can trade, or even part with money if I
&gt; have to.
&gt; guess I grab an .009 to at least get her back on the road for now.... but
&gt; looked I don't even have one of those.... mumble mumble mumble
&gt;
&gt; thanks
