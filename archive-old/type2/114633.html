&gt;Well, I pulled my engine and gas tank before I found out that the 211 
&gt;919 051 sender (fits '68-early '73 buses) is No Longer Available, at 
&gt;least not at the moment.  Ronnie told me that he's pretty sure they'll 
&gt;be back in production once the waiting lists get long enough.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, does anyone have a new or used (working please!) sender they 
&gt;would like to sell???
&gt;
&gt;I can PaytPal, send gold bars, my first born male child, etc...

They come up on Samba's classified all the time and usually go right away. I believe &lt;http://www.l5vw_dot_com/&gt; is a frequent seller of those units. Why not call him and ask otherwise keep a watchful eye on samba.
