Subject: Vent Window Rivet on 76 Bus

On my driver's side vent window, the rivet on the upper pivot has broken.
This is the pin that goes through the two flat pieces of the pivot and
connects the window frame to the outer frame.  Does anyone know of a source
for these?  A quick look through the RMMW catalog shows nothing although it
is apparent that there are different pivot mechanisms for different years.
Mine is a 1976.
