Check the accelerator for full opening of the throttle plate.
Wouldn't be the first time i have doubled the horsepower
output of a fine running engine that just won't go.

Netflix: The Perfect Movie Every Time!Hi all.  We have our engine wired up to where it will run.  It is acting very strange.  I
would sure appreciate any comments on this.  It runs great when sitting still now that I have installed a new carb.  Idles great,
revs up great, no smoke.  The trouble is that the thing when moving has no power at all.  On the level, it will go up to 45 or 50
but hit a hill and you will be lucky to get up it going 15.  It does not do anything too odd, though.  Just sems very weak.  Thus
far I have replaced plugs, dist., wires, coil, carb, rubbed all kinds of RTV over the intake to seal it if if it could be leaking,
checked throttle cable, checked the timing 5 times, wired the coil right to the battery with a big thick wire to make sure, checked
the choke, etc.  Is there something they could have done when rebuilding it that would make it run great but act this way?  Thanks
for any information.  Is there anybody on the list in WV I could pay to come here to Clarksburg and look at it?  Can't drive it
anywhere.  Glen Ward
