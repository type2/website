Hi all,

Yesterday i helped a friend of mine take out the engine and transmission in his 84' vanagon. He was having problems disengaging the clutch while driving. And once the cluch was in there was still a grinding noise.  Anyway we split the two to find out that the needle bearings at the end of the crank were gone, which also ate up the end of the transmission shaft. Now i know you can replace the bearings but what about the shaft? Do you have to replace the whole shaft or can it be reground?
