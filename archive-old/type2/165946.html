Subject: Re: [T2] the search for heat ends now  ..  Espar Airtronic D2

Because it is dead unused space that could be put to great use - and  
it could blow hot air right at your feet. I agree that Dan's  
installation is great and that there are other possible spaces in a  
bus. But that location would make me consider it over a BA-6. Just a  
question of personal preference. I found the specs online. It is 115  
mm wide - That may work in the rear part of that space. I'll take  
exact measurements tonight.
