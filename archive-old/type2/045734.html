Perhaps it wasn't intended, but you can split these things at the seams.

I did this to fit some good outers to my 79. The ones I switched over
weren't quite the same though and involved a little ingenuity, and I decided
to put a few welds in them to piece them back together.  On reflection, the
effort hardly justified it, though the 79's are an expensive part.
