&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt;     I found these parts on my stash the other day.  They were in a NOS box with the part number 211 035 657 A  and the word &quot;ENTSTORSATZ&quot;.  I figured there were type2 parts inside.  I look inside to find two black boxes, some kind of electrical items I've never seen before.  They are both unused.  The part numbers are 311 955 203  and 111 035 267 A  Here's a little description:
&gt; 
&gt; 2nd part
&gt; smaller box with just one single black wire. Has &quot;0,47uF/100V&quot; printed on it.
That is a capacitor of some kind.  Perhaps a noise supressor for the radio
or a condensor for the distributor.
