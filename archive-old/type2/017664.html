     Yup, a friend of mine still carries a nice scar from just that
event way back 0ver 20 years ago. There are more heavy-duty come-alongs
tho, including chain ones that just don't break.


&gt; 
&gt; There is a device called a &quot;Hi-Lift Jack&quot; that, along with some chain or
&gt; heavy cable, can do anything a winch can do and more, but more slowly. I
&gt; think they're less than $100. Very nice economical compromise if you only
&gt; get stuck twice a year.

     Well, I used to get stuck more like twice a week, and still found
the HiLift jack indespenible. Not only can you winch with it, but you
can tip the bus right over with it if so desired. .
