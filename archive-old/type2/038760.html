Subject: SOS from Oaxaca, Mexico

Hola!

A friend of mine and her '76 bus are stuck in Oaxaca, Mexico. A head needed
to be replaced, but now the engine will not start. Evidently, the local
mechanics are not familiar with fuel-injection and did not properly hook
things back up. She's been there for almost 3 weeks now and will soon need
to head back home to Quebec. If the bus cannot be fixed, she will need to
sell it there.

Anyone down there who can help by any chance?

Muchas Gracias,

Sami
