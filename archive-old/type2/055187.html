Subject: Westfalia notes.

Because there have been some questions recently:

The '68-72 Westfalia was based on the sunroof body.  There were no sunroof
tracks, cables or sunroof, but the pocket was there.  Others have
re-installed the sunroof (and at least one person has installed a pop-top
on a sunroof body :-). The poptop in these years hinges at the front and
the canvas under it should have thre window, one in each face.  The
interior layout is that there is a jump-seat behind the driver, a
sink/cooler cabinet behind the passenger (not all have sinks, some have a
flat top with a pump), a full-height clothes cabinet behind the sliding
door on the passengers side that extends all the way to the rear hatch and
a bed/seat that extends from the cabinet across to the wall on the
driver's side.  the upholstery was in mustard colored naugahyde and the
curtains were a plaid containing yellows and browns.

The '73 was *not* based on a sunroof bus, but had the same poptop and
interior layout.  The upholstery was a mustard cloth in this year only.
Because the roof of the '73 does not have the sunroof pocket, the upper
cot has a different design with flanges that are longer and do not wrap
around the sunroof pocket (which isn't there)  The curtains were the same
as the '68-72.

The '74 and 75 Westies have the poptop hinged at the rear of the bus.  
the entire roof under the poptop has been cut away and a bed installed.  
The canvas has only one windo cut into it, at the front.  The interior
layout has a 12v/110v refrigerator and sink cabinet behind the driver, a
stove cabinet behind the passenger, a full width bed/seat with a small
cloths cabinet in the rear driver's side.  The upholstery was a blue/green
plaid and the curtains were (?dark green?)

I am not familiar enough with the '76-79 Westies to be sure of the plaid
colors, but the poptop hinges at the back, as with the '74-75s.  They also
have the full size bed cut into the roof.  The interior layout is that all
the cabinets are laid out along the wall behind the driver. From the
frontand going back they are a stove/sink cabinet directly behind the
driver, a storage/cooler (or 12V/110V fridge), and a clothes cabinet.  
the bed/seat extends from the cooler/storage cabinet to behind the
driver's door.

I hope that this is useful in identifying which year of westy you are
looking at and which years can be fitted with a sunroof/sliding roof.  In
addition, Pat, the cot you have will fit '68-72, but not '73.
