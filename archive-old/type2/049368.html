Hi Folks,
   Seems a lot of people are appalled at the thought of striking blows on 
glass.  Not long ago I put in a replacement side window and couldn't believe 
how much force it took.  While my wife worked the rope and lube(silicone 
spray lube) I pushed for all I was worth.  With my back against a fence I 
slapped, hit and pushed on the glass so hard that the window actually bent a 
little.  Yes, that's right, I said bent.  Nothing permanent or radical, but 
it had a noticeable bow to it.  I didn't even know glass could do that 
without breaking.  I think glass, automotive safety glass, is tougher than 
we know.
   Just remember to use saftey precautions whatever job you might be doing 
on your bus.
