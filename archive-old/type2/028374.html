LEE WROTE:

&gt; The jack stands would be stable on concrete or similar surface, but
&gt; the knife edges of the base can obviously sink into a soft material.
&gt; We put the stands on some 2 x 12 pieces of wood scrap and finished
&gt; the job. The oil leak was coming from a push rod tube seal.
&gt;
It happened to me one time. I rounded the corners off on the big grindstone
and I swear it doesnt do it anymore.
