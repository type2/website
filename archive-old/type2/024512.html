The 73 9-passenger I sold earlier this year did not have reinforcement panels - for anyone
taking notes.

-Took the 71 upstate the other day to finally say good bye to the rust rocket (80 vanagon) stripped
off a few parts for prosperity and called the salvage yard. He said, I'll put it up on the hill for the
winter and if I sell anything off it, fine. If not, crushed in the spring. I hate doing that but this one really
had the rust disease bad. Rust halfway up the sides and the front doors would no longer open, nor
the hatch. Oh Well.

Good news is found my next project -
2nd owner 72 deluxe, owned by german photographer couple who traveled in the states in it in the
70s, put it on blocks in a warehouse when out of the country. 75 thousand original miles, white over
squash original paint, garaged most of it's life except for being in a flood 10 years ago, original 1700
not running, no top access panel, a little rust on the inside of the rear backing plates, missing middle
seat and emblem, but I think I can handle that... updates to follow..

-71 Robespierre
coming soon: -72 pumpkin deluxe
