Darrell,

Don't worry, you ain't missing anything... the straps I was referring to
are on the T4 busses.  The T1 engine hasn't got them.  But as long as I am
standing up here on the soap box...

For you T4 engine folks, it is very important that the muffler be
supported at the rear of the engine.  there are two attachment points one
on the right rear that bolts to the fan housing and one on the left that
bolts to the bottom of the alternator adjustment arm.  You may want to
check these occasionally (like now, before it gets too cold) because if
they break, the copper rings under the exhaust manifold are not going to
stay sealed too long, and worse you will eventually distort the whole
exhaust manifold.

For y'all with T1 engines, never mind :-) the exhaust setup is supported
at the rear by the pipes that attach to the head at the #2 &amp; #4 cylinders,
so you dont need the hangers

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
