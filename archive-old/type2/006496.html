1.  Logan Gray/Vintage Motorbooks now has an e-mail address.  It's:
vintagemotorbooks_at_home_dot_com
This should expedite VW manual, book, and literature searches/inquiries.

At Sunday's show he had several new items available, including special
brochures and manuals used to train sales and service staff about new model
year VWs.  Also had several nice installation and repair manuals for
Southwind and Eberspacher gas heaters dating back as far as the early '50s.

2.  A while back there was a discussion about the nylon guide block in the
sliding side door mechanism.  It was considered NLA and someone posted that
a Vanagon part could be made to work as a replacement.

Ken Madson [The Bus Co.] has correct new guide blocks for Type 2s, genuine
VW parts sourced from a VW dealer.  Ken's e-mail address is:
kenm_at_thebusco_dot_com

FWIW.....
