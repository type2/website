Subject: Re: door lock broken

I just did this same repair to my '78 last weekend. It was really gunked up,
and I was just short of breaking the key every time I tried to unlock it.
After clean-up and lube-smooth as silk

Q: In my attempt to pull the locking mechanism out, I knocked off a plastic
piece. I don't know what it does or how to reconnect it. After feeling
around, I thought I found a slot that was on top of the locking mech., which
is where I attached it.  After I re-installed everything, I slammed the door
and I could hear the plastic piece fall to the bottom of the door!  What is
this thing and how does it attach?

&gt; Lately the pass. side door lock on my 68 single cab has been becoming
harder
&gt; to open.  Not consistent, but happens enough to be irritating, I didnt
think
&gt; it was going to unlock last time. I was hopeing someone could give me an
idea
&gt; of what it might be, and what parts I might need to fix it before I take
it
&gt; apart as I'm incredibly short on time, trying to repair our house, and
would
&gt; like to have everything I need to do the repair on hand. Also any tips on
&gt; removing old, water damaged door pannels without completely trashing them
&gt; would be appreciated.
&gt; thanks!
