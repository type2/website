Hi All,
I got my bus to run over this past weekend after two years of neglect by the PO. It smokes a little from the driver side heat exchanger due to an oil leak from the head on that side. It's a 70 something 1700 pancake in a 77 chassis. Bought the whole enchilada for $250.00 Anyway, is it possible to change the pushrod tubes and tube seals without pulling the heads?? Also, when it finally started there was a pretty healthy knock coming from somewhere deep inside the case that diminished after a few seconds but never went away. Oil pressure is good. Haven't done a compression check yet, but a little ride around the parking lot told me there is lots of pep left (I think). Any suggestions or ideas will be gratefully accepted.
Thanks,
Jeff
