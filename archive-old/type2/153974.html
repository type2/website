Subject: My 73 VW Bus

Hey guys,

    Don't know if anyone cares, but I'm starting to log the progress of my
restoration on my 73 Bus. I've done a lot of work so far but unfortunately did
not take any pictures for about a 2 year period. I've just thrown together a
quick website that I am using to keep track of my projects. If anyone is
interested, you can see my progress (newest pictures are always at the bottom
of the page).


Go to www.PontiacPerformance.Net

Click on &quot;Current Cars&quot;

Scroll to the bottom and select &quot;73 VW Bus&quot;. (It's at the bottom cause it's
the oldest, not the least important).


Let me know what you think...



Todd
