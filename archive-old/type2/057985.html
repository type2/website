Subject: Re: engine front oil seal

Well, the seal is just a friction fit, so the idea is that you gently pry 
it out with the screwdrivers by hooking the inside &quot;lip&quot; of the seal and 
using the screwdrivers as levers.  The problem is there's not much to 
lever against and if you try and lever against a block of wood, then the 
angle of the screwdriver to the oil seal is such that you don't get much 
of a &quot;grip&quot; on it.

If you have a *small* claw-type hammer then use that instead; put the top 
of the head of the hammer on the end of the crank, reach under the oil 
seal with the claw, and gently pry that sucker out.  You could also 
spring for an oil seal remover down at your FLAPS that looks a lot like a 
claw hammer with two claws.  They're usually just $3 or $4 bucks.

&gt; to use them to remove it and I don't want to hurt the case using too
&gt; much force. Any ideas on getting that seal out of there?
