Subject: Re: [T2] seattle /west sound area parts

&gt; on the other hand, do you mean to say if i plug the aux reg vac line and
&gt; plug its mate on the big &quot;s&quot; hose off the afm, i'll do just as well as if
&gt; i had the little 90 degree ruber boot?   - steve

Well, once the engine has warmed up, it won't make a bit of difference. 
That aux air valve is only used during starting, especially when cold. 
As the engine runs, there is a heater element inside it that closes the
valve, thus blocking air going from the s-tube to the intake manifold. 
When the engine warms up (or a warm atmosphere), it also helps to heat
the element, blocking air from bypassing.  It's the same exact thing as
cracking the throttle open during startup and then slowly letting off of
the pedal as the engine heats up.

If I were you, I'd plug up both the holes that the aux valve connects to
(make sure it seals very well!) and see if you have the hesitation.  I
highly doubt that the aux valve is the cause, though, because the air
that flows through that valve is still metered by the AFM, so more air
flow, more fuel.  Your hesitation is probably coming from a vacuum leak,
faulty vacuum advance can, or a dirty distributor (breaker plate,
especially)... at least those would be the most obvious ailments.
