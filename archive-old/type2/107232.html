Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel tank return fuel nipple (converting to FI)

&gt;&gt;&gt;connecting the
return line to the vent nipple at the top of the tank
&quot;could&quot; cause the fuel to siphon back into the gas
tank and cause air to get into the fuel rail when the
bus is left for any ammount of time. This might cause
hard starting.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Many thanks for those good advices, all of you!

Make sense guys, i will put a second nipple on the bottom!

The accelerator cable ha to be re-routed for the Weber too!

Like a said before, i don't worry about installation problem, i worry about missing crucial electric/electromechanic parts.

You will here more from me on that project, of course, i will build a step by step web page when am finish.

One more question! The fuel level sender was change by the PO, it doesn't have the 5 screws that the Bentley is talking about, i wonder how to remove this one, it look like its press fit here????? 

Cheers, Ben
