George,

I have to agree that it would be difficult to attach the can to the engine.
If you drilled a hole in the can to attach it at a screw point you would
definitely have trouble with it leaking the oil. Maybe, though, if a person
attached it with something like a big glob of silicone you could perform the
experiment and then just peel the silicone off the engine case? But would
the silicon insulate the can unacceptably from the engine heat? How would a
person keep the oil from sloshing out during normal driving? If you sealed
the can it would surely explode from thermal expansion of the oil unless
there was adequate headroom (airspace) above the oil level. Also how would
you get an even current flow through the resistor with the varying output of
the alternator?

Just Curious,
