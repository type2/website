&gt; that waving thing on the road. I saw a bus going the other way on I-20
&gt; in Texas, and we were just about falling out our windows waving to each
&gt; other! 

One of the neatest things for me is how much little kids love my bus... i
dont know how many times i've gone past a minivan or econobox loaded with
kids where they all smiled and waved like i was the neatest thing they had
seen all day... kind of like being my own rolling circuis to them i
guess..

always brings a smile to my face and i wave back and smile at them.

never have been able to figure out how so many kids know to wave and smile
at busses, but i like it :)

peas,

Steve
