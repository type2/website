Subject: Fair Price for Paint &amp; Body

Hi Guys,

I am waiting on an estimate for painting my '74 micro...  The body shop owner
dropped by my house a couple days ago to inspect the bus and promised a fax
today (didn't arrive).

The bus is really straight and stripped down to a rolling shell.  All seals,
glass, engine, trim, lights, everything removed.  All rust has been ground out
and treated with metal conditioner.  There are small holes here and there
along the bottom eight inches where the rust used to be and a crease in the
front nose panel.
It's probably really hard to say what a fair price would be with such a
description, but I was wondering what some of you would pay (or have paid) for
such a job.
The bus will be painted inside and out one color: Dove Blue.

Thanks,

Tom
