Subject: My 77 Transporter

After 2 and a half weeks of repeated troubleshooting I've finally got my
bus up and running again.  Thanks to all who e mailed me with advice on
starter &amp; alternator troubleshooting.  It turned out to be a starter
that bench tested perfectly but did not perform under a load.

Anyway, I've resubscribed to the list now that I have it running again
and have more questions.

1. I have a 77 Transporter.  It has a 2000cc FI engine in it.  The so
called mechanic that owned it before me was a true &quot;hack&quot; and it appears
that the engine is not original?  The tube that runs from the EGR valve
on the intake air distributor is not connected to anything!  I noticed
that it runs down to the engine metalwork where it looks like it is
supposed to attach to the intake manifold on the other side.  The only
problem is there is no place on the intake manifold where the EGR tube
can be connected.  In fact after crawling under the vehicle to survey
the situation, I found there is no evidence of any kind of a system that
would appear to be a continuation of the tube seen in the engine room.
(charcoal filter etc.)  Any insight would once again be greatly
appreciated.

2. Since I've got the thing up and running again, I have been
experiencing a very mushy brake feeling and don't get the desired
stopping without pumping the brake once.  I think it has to do with the
vacuum servo assist.  I hear a great deal of hissing around the check
valve and have tried to seal the connections.  I don't have a vacuum
gauge but thought I might disconnect the hose from the check valve and
see what kind of a vacuum is being achieved by using my hand/finger
etc.  The master cylinder seems to be ok and there is plenty of fluid in
the system.  In addition I have not done anything that would introduce
air into the system.  Does my diagnosis around the servo diaphragm sound
justified?  Oh, I almost forgot.  When the brake is depressed, the
engine can be heard to idle up just a little. (standing still)

3. Lastly; probably before I attack the engine stuff, I need to install
a new swing arm lever pin and bushing kit that I recently purchased.
I've read through the articles on the web page and am still a little
shaky.  The bushings in the kit I bought (from California Imports) do
not slide onto the pin that was included.  Do I need to machine the
bushings so that they will slide onto the pin?  Also, can anyone clearly
explain the procedure for removing the old pin and bushings?

Sorry to post such a long message full of requests only.  As I get more
experience, I will try to contribute to the list by helping out when I
can.

Thanks.

P.S. My fuel gauge isn't working either but I'll ask about that another
day.  $500 seemed like a deal but I'm starting to wonder.  :-)
