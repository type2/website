Subject: Nasty Vortex Continues--Help!

Hello all, injecting short version--&gt;purchased 1st VW ('71 Camper) a month 
and a half ago with supposed &quot;rebuilt engine&quot;.  7 miles from PO pinging, loss 
of power, overheating, 2 miles later smoke.  Tow driver arrives and smashes 
into the rear, crushing it from end to end.  PO denies knowledge and tow 
driver agrees to pay damages but disappears.  Compression minuscule on 3&amp;4, 
so decide to rebuild my 1st engine with Mr. Muir as copilot and do the body 
work.  Rings on 3&amp;4 galled or melded together--also determine no rebuild was 
ever done!  Buy new stock LB (1584cc), and replace everything else but the 
carb (34pict3).  As I proudly step into the driver's seat for initial 
ignition test, the accelerator cable snaps.  After a couple days anxiously 
awaiting the part, I take her out for 1st test drive, 12 miles later pinging, 
loss of power, overheating...pull over immed.  While waiting for tow, trooper 
arrives looking for the Grateful Dead to pop from the interior and asks to 
search, I decline and it goes downhill from there with idle threats, etc.  
Finally, tow arrives, which ends up being his 1st tow on a rebuilt engine; 
naturally, it breaks down 2 miles in, and another tow arrives who disclaims 
the initial deal b/w myself and original tow since he wasn't privy, and 
consequently, I bend over yet again.  Finally get back 4 hours later to find 
compression is 105 in 1, 85 in 2 and 90 in 3&amp;4.
Sullen, I gaze into the engine compartment and funny I never noticed it 
before but no engine seal (didn't know there was one since I've never seen a 
bus engine compartment before--parenthetically, the problem with merely 
reading books).  
Q1.  So, in my primitive VW logic, could my seemingly complex prob bear this 
simple answer--no engine seals, heat rising from exhaust, recycling heat, 
hence engine temp, rings begin to ping, leading to loss of comp from galling? 
 
Q2.  Order Engine Compartment Seals (2) and Engine Firewall Seal.  Removal of 
engine is necessary for firewall seal, correct? Best way to install both?  
Now, I also noticed that this PO removed the thermo, and the hoses from fan 
to heater duct as well as hose from right head to air cleaner (then to carb). 
 I purchased new hoses and replaced the cylinder tin from the head, but 
necessary to have them on in warm climate?  Finally, small gaps around a) 3 
2-inch cylinder heat rising tubes through rear engine tin--necessary to seal? 
and b) crossover panel in rear has about 8 holes for screws which are open 
since PO bolted it down on rear edges to double as trailer hitch 
underneath--plug those 8 or so holes? 
Q3.  Okay, with my recent compression loss, (after eliminating overheat prob) 
should I a) rebuild again, b) replace rings, or c) drive a bit more to see if 
the rings seat better and hence hope for a bit more compression?  
Q4.  Black oily soot fires from the exhaust--too rich?  I've conducted the 
&quot;tune-up&quot; on the two screws on the left side carb (from rear) per Muir and 
type 2 archive.  What is the brass screw on the right?  Anything else I can 
do to help her reach a stable equilibrium?  Working within the dreaded combo 
of 009 centrif and 34pict3--any suggestions, upgrades, etc?
Q5.  Suggestions on best grade of oil for warmer climates?

Contrary to all around me who laughingly believe this to be the thorny bane 
of my existence, I realize that it is my gateway, for life never seemed so 
tangible, so pure.  It is within this primitive, yet ingenius, machine that 
learning to boldly accept one's fate exists.  And for this, one can only be 
thankful.

Thanks and I'm indebted for any gracious assistance, Brian.
