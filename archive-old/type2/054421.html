Subject: Re: Part 2 of Extremely HIGH oil pressure

what kind of oil are you useing, my oil pressure at idle when cold is 60 psi 
when cold... i peg out the guage if i rev it, drive around for about 20 
minutes and it drops to about 15 at idle and i cant rev it past 30 psi.. 
makes me nervice to see pressure that low so i switched oil from 10w-40 to 
15w-50 part synthetic althought that stuff looks awfull thin going in. i 
havent driven my bus to much since then. starter died and got a few 
carborator bugs to work out.
