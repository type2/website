fWe got the side sliders for my 71 from a parts place that we have done
lotsa business from.  The got them from an auto dismantler--secret
source, parts place won't tell us who they are getting this stuff for us
from.

Try junkyards, some ship.  There is one in Seattle (or therabouts that
ships), perhaps they could help you.

Can someone on the list post the name of that yard in Seattle?

Thanks,

Lauria Watts

&gt; We just installed a sliding side window in our '72
&gt; Bus, which came with another Bus we bought last year.
&gt; Now we'd like to get one for the other side, but
&gt; can't seem to find one.  I've checked various parts
&gt; suppliers on the web, but haven't found one.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a source for these windows?
