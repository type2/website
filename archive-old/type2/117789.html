Subject: Re: [T2] Compression test logistics

Theodore,

I believe the torque value for spark plugs is pretty high...my problem is 
I am always leery of torqing them too hi.  I have actually started using a 
torque wrench when I do mine and it always seems more than necessary.

Until I remember troubleshooting a t1 for carb problems and finally 
figuring out(3 hours later) that one of the plugs was just not tight 
enough....makes for a funny acting engine.

Cheers, dave

&gt; The reason IMHO that there is such a problem with people stripping out plug
&gt; threads is that too often the plugs are over torqued in the first place. I
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; am not sure what Bentley spec for plug torque but I would bet most plugs
&gt; are in there with twice as much. They just simply don't need to be that
