&gt; Sean, you were right the first time .  All buses manufactured since
&gt; August 76 have the heater fan relay receiving  actuating current
&gt; directly from the ignition switch.  The fan will run if the ignition is 
&gt; on and the red lever is positioned correctly.  Prior to 76, the fan
&gt; relay was actuated by current from the alternator  light circuit.
&gt; I have a 77 and a 79 which works as above and the Bentley wiring
&gt; diagrams and owners manuals  verify that it is a factory installation.
&gt; 
This was sent to me by Carl Ponder.  It seems he at least looked at the
Bentley diagram to see what was going on.  

This fits with the mail I've been getting from others.  Everyone who's
written saying the blower only comes on when the alternator is charging
had a bus older than '76 and everyone who wrote saying their blower
would activate with only the ignition switch on had a late loaf, with
only one exception, John Anderson, who said his '78 must have the
alternator charging.  There might have been one more but if there was I
don't remember.  

Interesting thread! :)

Sean
