Subject: FS: Late Bay parts

For Local Northern VA or MD people.


BRAND NEW in box S &amp; S one piece muffler for late bay (no provisions for Cat 
converter) - I bought it from S &amp; S directly, and wound up having my 
installed muffler welded.
$95    Pick up only.


BRAND NEW black locking gas cap (the newer style. I just bought it at the 
Manassas Bug Out yesterday for $15 because I thought someone local might 
want it.  I have enough!!)
$15 - firm (paid $15; sell $15)


USED muffler and crossover pipe for late bay.  No cat converter attached, so 
if you do have the cat setup, there is some value here.
$35 - negotiable, but not shippable   Came off a '77


USED  EGR filter 039 131 617 RMMW lists this item for '79 and '80-83 NON 
CALIF bus and Vanagon at $179.95. I have two.
$50 and $75.  The $75 still has the paper sticker on it.



These items are only available until 5 Sep 03  I can take pictures, but you 
can stop by and look yourself.
