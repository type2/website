Subject: Re: [T2] EGR and Vented gas cap

&gt; As usual I wanted an opinion from the group on two things. First the PO
&gt; of my '77 FI westy took off the EGR. Question is by not having an ERG on
&gt; the FI bus am I really doing harm to my bus? Or should I just use high
&gt; octane gas to avoid potential knocking? The head temp usually runs
&gt; around 350 and always has for me.

As others have said you are doing no harm as long as the openings in the
intake manifold and exhaust where the EGR sysem connect are sealed.

&gt; Second question is I had a problem recently with the fuel breather
&gt; system, but replaced all the connecters except behind the fire wall. I
&gt; will do them when I pull the engine and gas tank in the future. I did
&gt; get a vented gas cap to make sure I would not have a problem. Is a
&gt; vented gas cap wrong am I missing something? Do others use vented gas
&gt; caps too?

So long as vapors can escape and replacement air can enter there is no
harm in this.  It is not what was originally intended but it will not
cause any problems.

                             OOK!
