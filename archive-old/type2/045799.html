Subject: [T2] starting trouble in between hot and cold

I need some advice, my stock '77 (except for missing EGR)
has a hard time starting when in between hot and cold.  In
the morning it starts fine (~70F ambient, right up, vroom).  
If I shut it off after getting to work and restart it starts fine 
(vroom).  If I wait until lunch (~90F ambient) and try to start 
I have to floor the pedal and then it'll barely start.  Otherwise 
it'll just crank and crank and fire every once in a while but 
never start up.  Things I'm sure of is that my temp2 sensor
is new and getting a good ground - it recently fixed an
unrelated problem.  And that my auxiliary air regulator
is operating correctly and the rubber elbow that goes to it
is not cracked or leaking.  Is there anything else that I 
should/could check?

Thanks in advance,
Christopher Darilek
