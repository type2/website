Subject: Ok bought me a HVLP paint gun, look out!!!

So I have a green westy but bought a used good shape slider door today.
Unless you're blue-green color blind though, you're gonna notice the door is
a different color.
:-)
On the way home as I drove by the local toolshop they had a 59.95 gun on for
sale. I figured I'd buy it and see what havoc I can create. First step will
be to sand the old blue down so primer will stick, then get the green color
matched via the computer at the local paint shop, then try my hand at
spraying some green paint. Wish me luck!! Can't be any worse than the crappy
quickie paintjob the PO put on it. Any hints would be most welcome as I am a
total newbie with an actual paint gun. I've done plenty of great rattlecan
jobs on my motorcycle tank though!! Listing sandpaper grits for the
pre-primer prep etc would be great.
Thanks,
Courtney
