It is telling you that your engine is maintaining 14.7 A/F ratio.  The pulsing is what is supposed to happen with a properly tuned engine.  It should also indicate full-rich when accelerating hard and full lean when decelerating.  That is all the data it can give you.

&gt;There is another route for lambda measurement which costs a bit more, but is
&gt;far more accurate than a one or three wire sensor plus air/fuel gauge. It
&gt;uses a home-built kit and a special wide-band five wire  o2 sensor. If one
&gt;had one of these units you could plumb it into the vehicle for testing, then
&gt;remove it once things are set up.

Hoo-boy, is that ever a loaded subject.  The sensors are becoming hard to find and the kit is not trivial to assemble, but this is a good way to go if you're handy with a soldering iron.
