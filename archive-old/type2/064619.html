&gt; &gt;Those engines are NOT cheap, and they are not anything like the old

&gt; &gt;that wouldn't carry a dozen candy bars... and I spent more than when I
&gt; &gt;rebuilt the heads! When the carbs went &quot;bad&quot; from sitting, the local
&gt; &gt;dealer told me they went for $800 each (and there's two, count 'em,
&gt; &gt;plus the idling circuit).
&gt; 
&gt; I just don't understand those dealers.  You can get rebuild kits for the
&gt; dual Solexes for under $20 each from Vee Parts in San Diego.  But really,
&gt; there isn't much to go wrong on them.  A good cleaning will probably fix
&gt; things.  For $800 each, I'll give you my rebuilt carbs, fly out to wherever
&gt; you are, install them, fill your bus with gas, and buy you a steak dinner!

Oh, sure... now you tell me... but where were you 10 years ago? &lt;grin&gt;

Actually, it was the idle circuit, I later found, that was bad. You 
know, I don't know what ever happened to those carbs. I pulled them off, 
and they disappeared. Usually that stuff follows me around for years.
