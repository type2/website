Greetings List,
I replaced the fuel filter and it runs fine (for now). Only now fuel =
drips from the fuel pump (exit end). I thought I had, in my wiggling of =
the fuel line to get the filter off, loosened the line coming out of the =
pump, so I tightened that. It still leaks. So my question is this: Is my =
fuel pump shot or is there a cheaper answer to this problem?
Thanx in advance
