Some the alternative-energy suppliers used to sell
Danfoss 12 or 24 volt DC compressors in a &quot;kit&quot; that
had sealed connectors designed for easy assembly in
your own box.  I have know people that used them to
convert an existing freezer to a chest-type
refrigerator or to make their own refrigerator from
scratch.  Not sure if the compressors kits are still
readily available.  However, the folks at BackWoods
Solar would be the first ones that I would ask:
