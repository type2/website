Subject: Matching AFMs with ECUs

Folks,

I am trying to get a quick answer on matching some random AFMs from my
parts stash with their proper ECUs.  Alas, I am away from work and don't
have the EKTA CD at home.  Could someone do a quick lookup and tell me
what year are the following AFMs:

0 280 200 012 (I think this one is a '75)
          020
          024
          028

I would also like to know the year of a 022 906 021 S ECU and match it to
one of these AFMs.

                           TIA
                           Steve Dolan
