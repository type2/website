Don't mess with those siphon/blasting head blasters,
they aren't worth the powder to blow them to hell.

-John Cloonan

&gt; The reason I
&gt; ask is you can buy the blasting head from an
&gt; automotive paint store. Push
&gt; the hose in a bag of sand, presto, instant sand
&gt; blaster --- $15.00.
&gt;     See ya!
