Greetings,
I don't own a bus but intend to buy one (a camper), probably next
spring. So far by poking around on the net it seems that the 71-78 era
has good parts availability and that the parts are more reasonable for
those years.
As I'll be buying this vehicle far away and driving it home, spontaneous
roadside repairability will be paramount.

So I'm looking for advice:

1. Any years to avoid due to absolutely-not-available parts?
2. Do the parts places eg. Sherwood keep lots of stock?
3. Really typical problem areas to investigate when buying?

I'm not on the list because I can't handle the volume, so please email
me at jwallace_at_canada.hp_dot_com

Thanks,
Jim Wallace
