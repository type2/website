Subject: Re: [T2] The DEATH BUS an SUV in disguise!

Other than overloaded tyres that are prone to tread separation, no 
problems that I can think of...

Put the correct Load Range D tyres on it and you'll cure the problem. 
P225/60R14s ain't strong enough to hold it up. Check the archives.

&gt; 
&gt; Now the problem is that my old front tires were 75's I had the shop put on 2
&gt; 60's in the front. What are the potential problems of running 75's on the
&gt; rear and 60's on the front?
