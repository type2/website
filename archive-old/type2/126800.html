&gt; It was suggested to me that you can just as easily power the coil from 
&gt; the side marker lens. Hooked up from there, the engine will die as soon 
&gt; as you turn the parking lights off.

Hello Guys   Anyway you do this put a fuse in there . If you have a short 
with the hot lead to the coil it can melt the wire all the way back to the 
ingnition switch.  I think that snoopys switch probably has gone bad   later and
