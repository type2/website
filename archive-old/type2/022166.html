&gt;Oil pumps &quot;suck&quot; the oil in from the pickup tube.  I think the theory on

=====================================&gt;
Mike is somewhat correct here, but remember.....
(and I don't mean to be picking at verbs)

The pump does not &quot;suck&quot;. 
The pump &quot;pumps&quot;, and
by initially packing the pump with petroleum jelly, you are giving the
pump an immediate &quot;pumpage&quot; so that it &quot;very quickly&quot; has something to
&quot;pump&quot;. Only if pumping, can the flowing oil develop a pressure drop on
the inlet side of the pump, allowing the net positive head of the oil to
then enter into the pump.

Technically defined (duh!?) the net positive suction head available to the
pump must be greater than the net positive suction head required by the
pump. 
NPSHa must exceed NPSHr
(More Duh!?, since that word &quot;suction&quot; creeps in again)
 
Once this cycle starts, the engine oil then comes in to fill the void on
the inlet side of the pump, and the oil,  in turn, is pushed out into the
system.

Packing the oil pump with petroleum jelly allows for this cycle to start
all the sooner. Without packing the pump, you are relying on only the
close running tolerances of the pump elements to initially pump
&quot;whatever&quot;  to create this required pressure drop on the inlet side.
