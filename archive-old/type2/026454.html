&gt;I'm going to purchase an electric fuel pump since my mechanical one 
&gt;has since decided to stop working (it was fun using gravity to get
home, 
&gt;not really).  Do I need an engine specific one, (I have a 72 westy with
a 
&gt;1700 pancake with twin webers) or can I just go down to NAPA and pick 
&gt;up a &quot;electric fuel pump for carburetor engines&quot;.  Recommendations?

I use a generic one from my FLAPS (Pep Boys).  It's round, about 2&quot;
diameter and about 4&quot; long.  Cost around $35 and has a lifetime
warranty.  Works just fine with dual Webers with no pressure adjuster
needed.  After being stranded on the side of the road when it quit 5
years ago (and yes, you CAN drive with gravity-fed fuel!), I got the
original replaced on warranty and bought a second one as a spare.  Of
course, now that I have a spare, the original will never break, but
that's OK with me.

The kind that most people use is a little square pump, about 2&quot; square,
made by Facet.  These work OK, but they're awfully loud.  And you can't
get them everywhere - usually have to order them or go to a VW FLAPS.

I mounted mine under the bus, near the bottom of the gas tank.  If it is
mounted higher than the bottom of the tank, you'll run out of gas before
the tank is empty.
