Tom,

I am sorry to say that I do not remember.  But since I do not remember
pulling the pushrods and rockers either I think that the tin must have
been there.  That is something to ask each of the vendors.

&gt; As I remember from rebuilding the engine in my 75 myself, the injector
&gt; seals and intake runner hoses didn't come with the gasket set. are there
&gt; any other gaskets or hoses that anyone knows of that need to be ordered
&gt; separately? The FLAPS around here don't know what air cooled means!

A situation that is becoming very common.  If there were any full-service
filling stations left I would look for a near return of the day when the
attendant was at a loss for how to check for coolant.  O tempora! O mores!

The injectors and their associated gaskets and hoses are not considered to
be part of the engine&quot; but rather part of the &quot;fuel&quot; system and thus the
gaskets are not in the engine set.  Those gaskets are available through
most on-line vendors however.  For example see:

http://www.busdepot_dot_com/catalog.jsp?model=42&amp;category=20&amp;group=22

both the &quot;Distributor Pipe Sleeve&quot; and the &quot;Fuel Injector Seal Kit&quot; are
listed there.

                             OOK!
