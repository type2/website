Subject: Odd rust-thru under front bumper tube, 78

While replacing the clutch cable, I noticed severe rust-through in a
hard to see area under the front shield- between the front floor and the
bumper &quot;tube&quot; that is welded to the main body side frame on each side.
It is an interim wall that is continuous with the cavity behind the
front kick panels, and has a 1&quot; drain hose sticking out the center.  I
suspect water has been getting in somewhere and collecting in the
bottom- anyone see this occur? There is no rust visible under the
windshield seal, but even if it were bad, isn't there a lip that
wouldn't let water in??  May be it's getting in by the vent flaps?  Now
I gotta pull the kick panels (which have speakers and fiberglass batting
behind them) to see what's happening.
