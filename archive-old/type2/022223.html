Subject: WOW! .. 1600DP vs 1600SP

WOW!
I am jumping through myself to get ready for my trip departure this
Saturday.

So as to make sure all was well with the bus menagerie here, I took Maizey
for a spin around the block a few times.
She is a 69 with a new (rebuilt) 1600DP engine in her.
The engine has +/- about 10,000 miles on it.

I have been driving Casper (other bus) as of late.
Casper has a 1600SP engine in her with about 3,000 miles since her
rebuild.

I could not believe the difference in power between the DP and the SP.
All else is the same, except for clutch feel, etc.

Should there be THAT much difference in the two engines feel and power, ?
The DP feels like a rabbit jumping out from a bush.
The SP is certainly more closely related to the turtle.

Have others ever gone from a SP to a DP, and back again, so as to compare
the feel? What do you remember about the difference??

What did you notice ???
