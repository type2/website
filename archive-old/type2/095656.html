Subject: pressure gauge prices

 
--I saw 39.99 at sears, and I bought a 43.99 one at Kragen. Don't ask why. Steve's right, the 0-10 models can be had for 8.99.

Billy

&gt;The carb fuel pressure testers are in the $15 range, and go from 0-10PSI
&gt;The FI fuel pressure testers are a different beast and are far pricier,
&gt;but cover 0-60/100 psi.  I have seen them on sale for as cheap as $40, but
&gt;I would expect to pay $50-60 on an average day.  If you can find an FI
&gt;gauge for $15, tho... let me know!!!!
&gt;
