&gt; BTDT &amp; yes, you are right. the manuals are really no help on this one.
&gt; 
&gt; we used a small section of 4x4 wood along with a hammer.  work one side on
&gt; (which you have already done) &amp; then try to get the other side on. you might
&gt; have to go back &amp; forth from side to side &amp; keep working them on little by
&gt; little until they are both secure.
&gt; 
&gt; also, did you replace the spot welds on the ends of the torsion leaves? until

SPOT WELDS???? they have spot welds!

&gt; we realized we needed to re-do that weld, we had no luck whatsoever in
&gt; getting the new arms installed. the leaves wouldnt line up with the notches in
&gt; the arms until they were welded together.

time to dig out the welder,!  Thanks!
