Subject: Administrivia - PLFVW &amp; Goliath

Hello all,
These 2 threads are now killed.

PLFVW: it has lost its informational content and is now just to the pro/con
Dawn stage so STOP POSTING ABOUT IT.

Goliath:  A Goliath is not a VW.  Reserve Goliath posts for the Goliath
list.

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.
