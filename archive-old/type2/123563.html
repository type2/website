Subject: help id this camper conversion

last week i told you i picked up a 69 sunroof. i have no idea about the
conversion. would someone help help identify it?
http://members.efn_dot_org/~stevo/vwinterior.jpg this link shows the kind of
pull out bed it has. http://members.efn_dot_org/~stevo/vwwindow.jpg this link
shows the slider windows. and http://members.efn_dot_org/~stevo/vwwindow.jpg is
the washed out tag on the right dogleg. i have seen the same camper stuff
never until last week when one came into a repair shop for cannabilization
and i was able to pick up an identical 2/3 z-bench, and some spare slider
windows [worse than mine] and seals [better than mine]. two in one week is
wild, but what is it?  - steve
