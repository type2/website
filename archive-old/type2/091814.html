&gt;I bought an expensive side marker housing recently and the vendor claims
&gt;it's a Hella part.  The picture on their website is marked Hella but what I
&gt;received doesn't have any markings at all.
&gt;
&gt;How can I tell if this is a Hella item these days?

&gt;Rear Side Marker Housing W/Socket, Original Equipment Hella, 70-79 Bus
**********************
It should have the Hella Logo stamped into the plastic for it to be
genuine.  The ones being made now are repros made in India.  I know because
I know the guy who's making them.  They're decent quality (could be better
tho,) and shouldn't be going for more than $10-$12.  Original Hellas when
last available commanded between $20-$25.
