Subject: Re: [T2] vacuum level 

My 79 Cal bus is timed to 5 degrees ATDC (per spec) instead of 5 degrees 
BTDC as on other buses.  Should I still see the 16-19 inches of vacuum with 
this timing? I'm only pulling about 12 inches of vacuum (after new hoses and 
lots of testing) and it appears I will make finding this leak into a career.

No, your readings are fine.  A fresh engine may actually make less vacuum 
than one that is broken in since the rings may not yet be fully seated.
