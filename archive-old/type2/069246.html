Subject: Dual Solex (Kadrons) secondary venturi source needed

Hi folks,

I'm looking around for an auxilliary/secondary venturi for a Solex H40/44EIS
Dual carb.   I tried Berg, but they don't carry this part.  Most advertisers
have the rebuild kits and filters.  I'd appreciate any leads on a possible
source for this part.

Thanks,

Ron
