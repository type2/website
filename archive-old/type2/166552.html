Subject: Re: 73 bus with 83 subaru engine so far so good!

Greg, I am going to jump in on this one as I have had several subies and
know the engines well.

Richard is using a 1.8 liter NA EA-81 where he attached a SPFI manifold
from a EA-82 (approx 100hp).  This setup will fit in the engine
compartment with no problems, and is 100lbs less weight than stock type
IV.  In fact, I can pickup an EA-81 (without alt and exhaust) from the
ground to waist level so I am guessing the motor is in the neighbourhood
of 160 lbs(73 kg).

I am putting a NA EA-81 with EA-82 manifold and Weber carb(approx 95 hp)
into my 78 westy with a Kennedy kit.  I haven't figured out my cooling
issues yet.

Hopefully I will be driving it to Everybus next spring.

Kindest Regards,

Mark

&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt;
&gt; Any issues with the fit of the engine to the fuel tank? I have heard
&gt; that can be an issue with baywindow subie conversions.
&gt;
&gt; Happy Trails,
&gt;
