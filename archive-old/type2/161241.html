Subject: Anyone using a Battery Minder

Hi all,

Our '68 Riviera camper hibernates most of the winter here in the PNW.  I
start it up every 2-3 weeks.

I have some concerns about the battery life over the winter hibernation
and have had thoughts of investing in a Battery Minder.

Anyone opinions on these devices?  I searched the archives and didn't
get any hits.

One of the questions I have when using such a Battery
Charger/conditioner is can you simply hook up while the battery is still
in the bus and connected to the electrical system?

Thanks,
Greg
