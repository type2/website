Subject: RE: [T2] Dead Battery? Intermitent Fault?  Weekend away in
  tatter s?

&gt; Cheers Bob
&gt; 
&gt; I have re-charged the battery and have tested the cells, the readings are
&gt; all over the place but the one cell is really low, I am going to wait for
&gt; 4 hours to see if it settles down afer the charge but hopefully it is just
&gt; a new battery that is required.........
