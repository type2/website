&gt;&gt;Does anyone having experience with driving I10 through NM and AZ 
&gt;&gt;have something that I should know (like is it better to drive at night)?  

It is definately better to drive at night.   Better for the engine temps,
and much better for the driver temps!  Only problems with that are
potential drowsiness problems and you miss all of the scenery.  Anything
outside of the city is scenery to me, even I-10.  :)

&gt;A good general rule of thumb is:  If you've got the windows open and you're
&gt;still sweating your ass off then so is your engine.  I drove my 73 Westy
&gt;(type IV motor) from San Antonio through Amarillo, Albuquerque, and Phoenix
&gt;on my way to Jerome last year in September.  And it was HOT!  I made a point
&gt;to always be on the road very early in the morning and make my best time
&gt;(4200 - 4400 RPM) before it got too hot outside.  Then around lunch time
&gt;when the temps were in the upper 90's - low 100's, I'd back off the pedal
&gt;and drop down below the 4K mark.  

I'll relate my own experience on that same trip, which I seem to do at
least once a year.  The higher the engine RPM, the hotter it runs.  Sounds
simple but there are several reasons behind it.  Let me attempt to list them.

1.  RPM's rise with speed, and wind resistance rises at a geometric rate
with speed.  Therefore the faster you go in a particular gear (namely 4th),
the hotter the engine will run by virtue of the fact that it must produce
more horsepower to overcome the higher wind resistance.  In the lower gears
wind resistance is a much smaller factor.  

2.  Air cooling does not work as well at higher RPMs.  No doubt some people
will violently disagree with me on this point, so let me explain.  As we
all know, the fan turns at a fixed percentage of the speed of the crank.
Crank spins faster, fan spins faster.  VW engines were designed to be run
at moderate speeds, some have said 3600rpm which I basically agree with.
Spin them faster than this and the cooling efficiency starts to drop.  What
I mean by this is that at 5400 RPM your engine is spinning 150% as fast as
3600rpm, burning 150% of the fuel, but it is not getting 150% of the
airflow over the cooling fins.  There is a point of diminishing returns
that is a result of the design of the cooling system.  I don't know exactly
where this point is, but I suspect it is between 3500 and 4000 rpm.

3.  Engine efficiency.  I think this one is the most important and
basically overwhelms the others.  Driving at your torque peak RPM should
produce the coolest running engine.  This is because at that RPM the
maximum amount of energy is being transferred to the wheels and the minimum
amount of energy is wasted as heat (per amount of gas burned).  I found out
that the torque peak for my engine is at 3100rpm.  At 4000 rpm, torque is
down something like 20% (don't have it in front of me).  This means some
12hp (or 20%) worth of additional waste heat has to be removed from the
engine at 4000 rpm, in addition to the extra waste heat from the higher RPM.

So, ideally one should drive as slow as they can bear without going below
the torque peak of their engine.  My &quot;perfect speed&quot; turns out to be near
55mph, but I like to drive 10mph faster than that.  On those 110 degree
days in the deserts of the southwest, I slow down to 60, and if need be,
55.  Seems to help, too.  People like Mike Gensler who have bigger carbs
can get away with more RPMs due to a higher torque peak, or so goes my theory.

&gt;&gt;Would it be necessary to get a temperature gauge?  
&gt;
&gt;Know your bus, man!  A temp gauge is a great tool to keep an eye on the
&gt;ever-changing temps of the life-preserving fluid of you beloved bus.  But
&gt;the same can be achieved by pulling over about once an hour (hey, your butt
&gt;will thank you too) and popping open the engine lid to check things out.
&gt;Feel the heat with your hand, eye-ball everything, take a wiz, grab a cold
&gt;drink, stretch you legs, check your oil level after it sits for a few
&gt;minutes and your on your way again.

Yes!  I agree with that 100%.  I prefer to have gauges rather than stop
often, just because I usually am in a hurry to get to where I'm going
(usually campouts, with my VW friends!).  Get the gauges!

&gt;&gt;Is a rich mixture a good way to keep it cool?  
&gt;
&gt;Interesting question about the mixture.  I purposesly jetted my dual Weber
&gt;carbs a little richer for the trip.  Cost me about 1 mile to the gallon, but
&gt;I felt like the SLIGHTLY richer mixture would allow the heads to run a
&gt;little cooler.  Maybe a good idea, maybe a waste of gas money.  But it gave
&gt;me piece of mind and I didn't have any troubles.

I am fairly certain that it helps.  I did a little experiment with jets and
what I found was that my CHT went up with a leaner mixture, but my oil
temperature did not (at least not significantly).  High CHT makes me more
nervous than high oil temp though, so I like running a little rich also
when it's very hot.  I'm going up YAJS (yet another jet size - 147.5 but
don't try that size with the stock venturi'd dual solexes) for my next trip
out to California.
