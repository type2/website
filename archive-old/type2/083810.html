&gt; Chris,
&gt; I did this with my 2 battery setup.
&gt; #1 Use a digital voltmeter, they are much more accurate than VDO's and will
&gt; give you the voltage within a 10th of a volt. I found mine at a hot tub shop
&gt; for around $40...good quality made in the USA. I mounted mine on the ashtray
&gt; front...fits perfectly with a large readout.
&gt; #2  I used 2 heavy duty all metal toggle switches installed on the lower
&gt; right front dash next ot the steering wheel shaft. One was tied into the main
&gt; aux battery line (It has its own fuse box behind the glovebox) and the other
&gt; was connected to I think #11 on the Bus fuse box. I used common ground for
&gt; both.

If all you're measuring is voltage, you don't need a heavy switch as
current will be very low.  If you use a SPST switch you only need one
switch, and you don't have the chance of crossfeeding the batteries
throught he switches.
