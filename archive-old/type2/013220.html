If you have a double relay, it already does this.

The double relay turns on your cold start injector when you  activate the
starter, turns it off when the engine starts, the AFM turns the fuel pump
on as the air flow increases. If air flow completely stops the AFM turns
the pump off.

If you're not sure of this activity you can put a indicator light between
the positive side of your fuel pump and graund and verify this.

 I want to do it so that it will shut 
&gt; off if 
&gt; the engine stops running...&quot;
