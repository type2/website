Subject: Clutch Release Bearing Failure

Hey All,

Any ideas what would cause a one-year-old throwout bearing to fail? I thought 
perhaps it was because we didn't grease it when we put it in, but I picked up 
a new one and it doesn't look like it can be greased...

The bus has just 3,000 miles on it since I redid the engine and replaced the 
clutch and bearing.
