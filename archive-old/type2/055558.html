A brief rundown of the trip my sons and I took in our '69 Dormobile over Easter.
- 10 Apr, planning to leave Great Falls about 5pm, we finally cruise out of
town at 7:30,    typical.
- arrive at friend Huw's house in Calgary at approx 0230, a head-wind,
general uphill grade and not wanting to push the newly broken-in 1600DP, I
really tested my enthusiasm for my new hobby/lifestyle/vehicle.  I used to
make GF to Calgary in 4.5hrs in my Ch***kee.
-Saturday, pick up my mum(she rode the GrayDog down from Edmonton) and head
out for Edgewater, B.C. on the TransCanada Hwy, #1.
- Bus is doing well, the uphill challenges to Banff are tough but she takes
them in stride.  The big test will be after we turn off the #1...A little
while after passing Banff, there is an exit for Hwy 93, as soon as you clear
the overpass you know you're in for a haul.  The Green beast makes it up,
third gear, 30mph, but we make it.  then it's a mixture of up and down
accross some of the most scenic mountains I've ever witnessed.  
- Next pass is the hardest pull on the way to Radium Hot Springs, only once
did I need to drop to second gear, but I did pass two semi's and an S-10 !
-  After topping out on that hill, you'd better be absolutely sure your
brakes are tip top, or it's Toad's Wild Ride!
-My boys finally get to field test the bunks in the Dormobile, to my suprise
no running in the house in the middle of the night, and they gave the best
approval possible for the comfort of the bunks, they asked to sleep in there
the next two nights!  I can't wait to get a camper interior put in there so
I can participate. (it was gutted when found)
-  After an awesome turkey dinner in celebration of Easter, a couple of
trips to the Hot Pools at Radium, a few nature walks and more than enough
cribbage lessons from my Grandfather, we left Tues a.m. back to Calgary. 
-  We sailed into Calgary about lunch time, by design, so we can patronize
the deli co-owned by my high school buddy Craig Watson.  It's Spolumbo's and
it's awesome!  The Ponzerotti and meatloaf sandwiches are simply incredible.
-Weds we head to Edmonton, my sister was graduated from the NAITcomputer
program on the 18th , president of the student association!  The boys and I
hit the discovery zone, wave pool and various Malls(but not the BIG one.  )
-Sunday the 19th we have to make the trip all the way back to GF from
Edmonton, (Iowa tests start Monday). 
-Smooth sailing 'til Lethbridge, I start to notice a hesitation or 'buck' at
speed.  especially on an uphill grade.  Nothing obvious jumps out at me when
I check the engine area, so I press on.  By the time we get home it's
gradually worsened and I'm too tired to care.
-I call my guru down in Butte monday morning and he tells me the advance
plate is likely stuck, I had already checked to see if it was holding
vacuum.  so I loosen it up with a screw driver and WD-40 per his advice and
head into town on errands.  It's still running bad, but now gets worse until
it dies in traffic and won't restart.  I fiddle and looks and fart around
for twenty minutes and call the Girlfriend to come get me.  While waiting I
decide to check the points/gap. 
-Closed!, not even touching the cam in the dizzy!  I must have knocked it
loose when fooling with the advance.  So I reset the gap, tighten everything
up and had it running before the Girlfriend arrives!  Another minor lesson
learned, I'll check stuff like that sooner next time, I was thinking I had a
fuel problem.
- the low-down on the big trip, 1700 plus miles, no major malfunctions,
averaged about 19-20 miles per gallon on the whole trip.  -Any suggestions
why it's not up in the 25 + range?   
We love our new/old Dormobile.
thanks for the indulgence,
