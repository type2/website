Subject: Re: [T2] New Plastic stud locks for type IV

Jeff,
Bus Boys was able to locate these little plastic inserts 
for me about a year ago. I don't have the part number on hand 
but i could email it to you this evening if you'd like. Just 
by my description they were able to locate the part number.

&gt;The type IV engine has plastic inserts that go around the six 
&gt; main bolts used to hold the case together. They keep the bolts 
&gt; from falling out....
