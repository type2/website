Subject: VWapster

I know it saw that in one of the VW magazines!!!!
But what issue?????
Use VWapster at http://www.flat4_dot_net/Tech/tech.html

Not many of the pages work but it is up and running in the Magazine Index
I want to thank Erik at erik_at_inetfusion_dot_com for getting the index on the
web.  A
Also want to thank George Akers at georgeakers_at_home_dot_com for helping to
compile the Index

IF you have some of the earlier issues please get me the info I need to get
the months that we re missing.  I am going to try and get VW Trends, Hot
VWs, VW Custom, VW Custom and Classic, Vintage Voice(VVWCA), if I can get
the info.  Also later I would like to get the info for Volksworld and the
other foreign magazines
