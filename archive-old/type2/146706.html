Subject: Re: [T2] Short range FM transmitters (&amp; movies for the kids)

The FM transmitters have a poor range; I returned one, as it worked only 
a few feet from the radio.  Better to use a radio with an AUX input and 
use an adaptor to feed the LINE out from a DVD or CD player to the phono 
plug inputs.  For a PA, consider a PC mic, and feeding the headphone 
output to the same radio AUX inputs.
      At Westies in the Woods they had a digital projector on an 8 ft 
sheet feeding from a 12v inverter playing the Futurama episode with the 
VW bus and a movie-(Herbie?) - the kids watched even when it rained 
(projector was in the tent)!
