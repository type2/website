Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pressure Check

&gt; My bus has been having an intermittant starting problem, and after checking various things, I am beginning to suspect the fuel pump or regulator.  It seems as though it is taking a while to build pressure.
&gt; The local FLAPs don't sell a fuel pressure tester that will work on my '78 Westfalia (threaded connection too small on the rail) Is there a way that I can use these testers ( I think they are ACTRON brand), or is there another way to see what my pressure is?  Is the test port a NPT thread?

I used a piece of FI hose to connect em with hose clamps.
