Subject: DOC Tim!!!

1st off after sifting through all the great responses to my redundant
?'s(thnx for your patience all!)
I noticed a slight confrontation involving DR TIM. Very unsetteling.
Although this is not the forum and this will all probably be killed I just
had to speak up so as to not discourage any constructive responses to ? such
as mine and others.
In regards to

&gt;Hi all...Need help...' 81 Vanagon...Emissions...&lt;
Lets see now...' 81 Vanagon, oh yea, that came stock with a bored and
stroked
American Motors 401...yea, thats the ticket...Vanagon. 1981. 2.l eng. Bosch
AFC fuel injection. Time to check the bi-focals, Doc.
Beckett

A) Although DOC Tim made a !slight! oversight in the make of the vehicle he
offered every  poss. solution he could come up with! As is his nature.
B) All beckett did was point out this oversight and hold it up to over 900
people for his own &quot;satisfaction?&quot; and provided no response or answr to said
question.(as is HIS nature?)

One could only assume the only reason for the post was to inflict some sort
of &quot;dig&quot; at one of our National Treasures. DOC TIM. If this is the case
Beckett needs to do some soul searching and re-read what the purpose of this
list is. WE would ALL appreciate it. Sarcasm DOES NOT travel the binary
highway well, if at all. If a personal apology to Doc was made... so be it.
Although a slam in front of this many people for the hell of it should
require more then that. IMHO.
