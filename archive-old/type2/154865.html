Subject: Re: [T2] sunroof parts

Hi Mario,

Sunroof parts are hard to come by.... I bought the last pair of  
cables CIP had, and that was over two years ago. Those cables don't  
age well... if they get rusty they will break quite easily.

AFAIK there's no difference in parts used from 68-79.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
