Subject: Fresh air grill on '79 Bus

The PO had the front skin (body panel) replaced on my bus - they did a
pretty good job.  The only problem is that the grill does not sit flush with
the front of the bus.  I need to fix this and could use your help. I'm
trying to figure out what is preventing the grill from going in further and
sitting flush.   I would like to see what the clips (that the grill screw
into) look like - so if anyone has their grill off, would you shoot some
photos and either post them or pmail them to me. I'm trying to understand
their relationship or distance back from the front of the bus.  

TIA,

Wayne
