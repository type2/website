Hi Volks!

&gt; The 65 I just picked up has a sliding door and all the
&gt; ones I've had in the past have been double doors.  

Sliding doors have been available as an option since '63, a
couple of months before the wide rear hatch was introduced.
On the Bay they became standard equipment.

&gt; Are the parts and
&gt; maintenance the same as the later model sliding door buses?  

The door as such should be compatible to pre-74 Bay sliding
doors, but there are subtle differences in the shape of the
outer door handle.  I wouldn't be surprised if the inner
handles etc. were different as well.

Maintenance should be the same.

&gt; I'm looking forward to parking this bad boy
&gt; beside the Westy (76)  as soon as it is ready.

Congrats on your cool find!

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
