Folks
Our 2000ccF.I. Westfalia runs normally, but the idle has gone bonkers. It has
been running _at_ the set 950 rpm, but lately has preferred the 1600 rpm range,
no matter what I try to do to change it back. I've crushed all the original
cloth covered vacuum
hoses trying to find a leak. The archives/Bentley directed checks are O.K. 
i.e. cold start valve,AFC, aux. air valve, fuel pressure, relay functions,
compression ect.
The local VW guru spent two hours messing with it (pulled the distributor and
lubed the innards, then reset the point gap with a hacksaw blade...) No harm
done, but no improvement in the idle either...and I'll have to reset the
points because the dwell is off the gauge scale :)
As the engine idles at it's self selected 1600 rpm and I push the brakes,
nothing happens, but if I pump the brakes the rpm drops drastically and stalls
the engine sometimes...but not always. At other times she runs and idles
normally.
Can anyone advise or suggest a fix for this, as this erratic engine behavior
is causing me to behave erratically too. Please help.
