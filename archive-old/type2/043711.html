Subject: [T2] idle problems.....

i wrote a little while back about a bus that i was looking at buying.
well, i bought it.  i knew beforehand that there were some problems with the 
engine, as far as it not being able to hold an idle.  so i had the bus towed 
to my house where i figured i could just spend a few hours looking for a 
loose hose somewhere.

but i haven't found anything.  i checked out all the basic stuff first, like 
points and timing and compression.  everything checked out.

here's what happens when i start it:  i turn the key and engine starts right 
up, and as long as i have my foot on the gas it will stay running.
as soon as i take my foot off it dies out.  sometimes it happens right away 
and sometimes it happens after a second or two, but always immediately after 
taking my foot off the gas.  when this happens there is an audible sucking 
noise that comes out of the engine.  i'm sure its a vaccum leak somewhere, 
but i can't find any.  i looked in the archives for &quot;vaccum leak&quot; advice but 
they all deal with spraying something in the engine while its running, which 
i obviously can't do if it won't idle.   so what do i do?  the PO put in a 
new fuel pump, pump relay, and air flow sensor.  any help would be great....

mark.
