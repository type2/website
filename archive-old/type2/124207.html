Subject: missing tin?

Im having a problem with elevated oil temps and have been trying to figure
out why for some time.Today while running the motorI feel around the engine
compartment to find air leaks,and the area right beside the injectors is
pumping air.It seems like there should be a piece of tin beside and above
the injectors.Heres what mine looks like:

something.Need help in MO Thanks
