I have the electric frige in my 74, only used on AC at present.  I plug
it in overnight before we leave to get it good and cold, then I take a
gallon milk jug, fill it with water and freeze it.  this is used to keep
things cold untill it is plugged in again.  The block of ice in the jug
will last the entire weekend, and you dont have the problem with draining
water as it melts, with the added plus of an available gallon of water if
needed.

&gt; &gt; This may seem like an elementary question but.........
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have been thinking about the functionality of the Westy icebox 
&gt; unit 
&gt; &gt; in the 68 to 73 campers. Please share you experiences and ideas 
&gt; for 
&gt; &gt; making it work. What works best:dry ice, dry ice, frozen ziplock 
&gt; bags 
&gt; &gt; of ice, use the ice box for dry storage :) ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; BTW, many folks just remove theirs and perhaps for good reason but 
&gt; I 
&gt; &gt; want to make a go of it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks

&gt; Chris,
&gt; 
&gt; I use a large block of ice in the ice try (wish someone made a 
&gt; replacement part as it's getting worn out). That worked to keep 
&gt; frozen idems frozen for about 48hours and kept everything else cold 
&gt; too.
&gt; I did have a probem with water leaking from drain hose(from ice try) 
&gt; into unit but I'm sure I can fix that.  I personally like this ice 
&gt; box set-up with sink. I like th rear facing sit behind driver's 
&gt; seat.  
&gt; 
&gt; Take Care
