Subject: engine parts as conversation pieces...

I've got a few things I have saved for their aesthetic value...

one flat cam from JC Whip-me... bad rivets worked loose and the gear
separated from the cam, even though cam gear and gear on crank were same
number... I cut it in half, drilled it through, welded it back together,
and turned it into a lamp for a friend of mine... I have several cams I
plan to do this with... and maybe I'll have a Cam-Lamp table set up at a
VW show sometime soon... options of 110 V or 12 V plug/bulb, too...
(perfect accessory for Westies...). Crank-Lamps aren't too far behind.

one 1700cc piston, with a ragged hole in the crown the size of a kiwi
fruit... and the obligatory pieces o' valve to boot. engine was
&quot;rebuilt&quot; by an uncle of a friend... and the exhaust valve broke and did
a heck of a jig... the uncle also advised that we tip the bus over on
it's side to remove engine and transmission. Somehow I have had many
people recommend that to me...(?) I declined, instead taking a shovel
and digging a flat shelf into the ground below the bus on which to set
our plywood and jack...

one 85.5 mm piston, hole burned through a corner near the top
compression ring... the same friend drove his (my old, and now mine
again) '65 bus through a very large ditch somewhere in Mexico... The
jolt dislodged one of the sheet metal air deflectors, and the engine
then roasted the piston, #2 I think... It took him about one case of oil
to make it back to Flagstaff. The other deflector had been safety wired,
and stayed put. live and learn...

Jim Keck, who used to own Broadway Foreign Car in Knoxville, once showed
me a ballooned oil cooler... don't have one yet...

I used to have a type I hubcap which had lain in a busy parking lot for
so long that it was completely smashed flat... can't find it now...
also  had one that came off of my '68 type I after it rolled in '89...
can't find it either. Perhaps the concussion I received had something to
do with it.
