Subject: Re: [T2] Re: electrical connector corrosion

&gt; My feeling: bad practice!  I don't know about latter-day VW wiring, but the
&gt; earlier buses and bugs used un-tinned, stranded copper wire.  It corroded
&gt; quickly inside the crimp lugs, resulting in voltage losses, especially if
&gt; moisture was present.
&gt;
&gt; Dim headlights made it easy to identify on-coming VWs :-((
&gt;
&gt; It's not difficult to obtain #14 tinned, stranded wire; it's just a bit more
&gt; expensive than solid, untinned.  FWIW older cars, even British cars, were wired
&gt; with stranded wire -- soldered where we now see crimp-connexions.  Surely a
&gt; matter of &quot;value engineering&quot; since the problems do not surface until a couple
&gt; of years have elapsed and the warranty has timed-out.

Properly done crimp connections are airtight and are as robust as a
soldered connection. good crimpers are expensive though and usually handle
only one or few specific connector types. the typical crimper does a
mediocre job of it.
I dont think the degradation of old vw harnesses is usually the crimp
itself but the connectors corroding.
