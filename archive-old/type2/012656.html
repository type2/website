Subject: easy leak check
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Yesterday while doing many little jobs around the house I
washed the bus (Had two days off thanks to &quot;the big one&quot;).
I hit my rims with the hose to do my patented brake fluid
leak check and found the RRwheel needs attention.
  If you hit the rims on the inside of the wheel with a
sharp blast of water and it foams like there is soap there
(and you know there isnt) then you have brake fluid
leaking.
Everytime I wash das bus I bend over an hit the inside of
the wheels with the water blast from the opposite side of
the bus.. you gotta spray the inside surface to get the
best result. Foam will be obvious. It doesnt take alot of
brake fluid residing there to create the effect.
