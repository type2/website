Hi Volks,

Barry wrote more about coping with too-low garage doors...
&gt; Let me see.  Combining your top two ideas, if you remove the 'junk'
&gt; rubber from the wheels by pulling each side OVER the rim (so that the
&gt; rubber tire sort of flops around OUTSIDE of the rims), you could scootch
&gt; the 'bus' into the garage without damage to the floor.

Barry, you're a genius!!!  Gotta tell that idea to my pal with the 
highroof camper.  He'll love it!  Whenever you come to Germany, let 
me buy you a beer and a pizza...  if this works, but I can't see why 
it should not.

Yours,
    Erik.
