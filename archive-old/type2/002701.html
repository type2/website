X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I too use these bottles for my stove &amp; lantern while camping.  I don't
store the bottles in the bus while at home, but when camping, I just
keep them in the storage compartment next to the icebox/fridge when
driving, and outdoors somewhere while at the site.  That storage is
next to the typically packed icebox and never gets that hot.

As a bit of warning, I wouldn't advise holding onto partial bottles.
Maybe it was because I bought an off brand, but twice now I have found
a bottle to leak after having been used (though many times before I
have had no problems).  Best bet is to get a quality refillable one.
Particularly since you may be disposing of less than empty bottles,
make sure you dispose of them properly.  Most campgrounds will take
care of them for you.

&gt;      I have a Coleman propane stove.  I bought the small Coleman
bottles for
&gt; this first trip.  Eventually I will buy a large, refillable propane
bottle.
&gt; Since the bottles are not to be exposed to temps higher then 120F,
where do
&gt; you store them?  Both for driving &amp; while in camp?  If I do get a
large
&gt; bottle, the same question.  Where do you have the large bottle when
you are
&gt; cooking?  I looked in the archive but did not really get my question
&gt; answered.  Most questions were about built in propane appliances.
Any
&gt; propane suggestions will be appreciated.
