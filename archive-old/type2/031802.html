Subject: Re: [T2] How do valves work?

&gt; I understand the basic concept of the cam pushing the pushrod which then
&gt; pushes the rocker and then pushes the valve, but how does the hydraulic
&gt; part work on the hydro valves?  I know that there's the little cylinder
&gt; that rides on the cam, but how does it maintain the proper clearances
&gt; instead of having to manually adjust the valves with solid lifters?

the hydraulic part keeps the pushrod in contact with the cam all the time
so it doesn't &quot;tap&quot; everytime there is an upstroke.  they are preloaded to
match the spring rate of the valves so they &quot;softly&quot; open the valves as
the presure builds.
 
&gt; &gt; also, how do modern car valves work?  Are they hydraulic?  Why don't
&gt; they need as much adjustment.

they are all hydraulic of one sort or another

VW hydraulic don't need adjusting either.
