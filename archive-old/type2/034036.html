Subject: Karma Continuation/ Free....

Hello,

Recently a list member started a Karmic trend that I hope continues.  By 
offering some brake pads for free the member inspired another listee to give 
away a light fixture for a Westy.  I expect to recieve the light fixture 
sometime soon and to continue the trend would like to offer a 1978 Type 2 
Owner's Manual for free to any list member. The recipient is encouraged to 
offer up something else to the list to continue the good Karma/Holliday 
Spirit.

Thanks to the list members who have participated and who intend to 
participate.  I hope to see this continued!

The first person to email me with their mailing address will recieve the 
manual via post ASAP.

Sincerely,

Jeffrey Christensen
