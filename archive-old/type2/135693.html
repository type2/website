Subject: Adventures in fuses (long, as usual)

Wow. Rain rain rain! 

I had mentioned before that I fixed my wipers (yay!). The switch that
was in my bus was hosed... The white plastic parts were all cracked
and otherwise jacked up. So I was turning the wipers on by plugging
the wire into the 6-way connector. But I remembered on Sunday that I
had another switch that I had grabbed when I got my turnsignal switch
from the junkyard. Woo Hoo!

Install the new switch, plug everything in (wire colors matched) and
tried it. First switch, slow, worked fine. Every other position got
nothing. Also, the wipers wouldn't autopark.

Bummed, but willing to deal with it later since the wipers were
working at least in slow mode, I went on my merry way. Until the first
time the fuse blew.

I forget which one it is, but it's the always on fuse (9 or 10? 8?
Can't remember, but it's on the right hand side...) It first blew when
I was in the rain on a hill in traffic stopped at a light. Took my
headlights and ignition with it. Not a great place to be broken down!
I turned my hazards on and checked my fuses. Found the blown fuse and
went to get a new one. DOH! I was out!

Even with my hazards on people were honking and yelling and showing me
that I'm number 1. Anyway, rather than doink around with fuses while
I'm in the middle of the road, I pulled my handy dandy jumper out of
the pouch I keep in the engine compartment and ran it from the battery
to the ignition. The wire started melting! Ok, disconnect the black +
wire from the coil, reconnect the jumper, perfect. Drove around the
corner, still no headlights.

Once I was out of traffic, I did the musical fuses thing, and
disconnected the wiper switch. Took the wife to her physical therapy
(where we were initially heading). While she was inside I started
checking stuff out after chasing down a new box of fuses at Kragen.

Things to figure out:
- Why was the switch shorting?
- Why would it only happen after driving a couple of miles? 
- Were there any conditions when the switch WOULDN'T short?

I put the switch back in the circuit and it worked fine! I was really
confused, so since I was armed with new fuses and a new pair of 12&quot;
longnose pliers with insulated handles (for manipulating fuses) I
decided to see when it would pop again.

Drove to work this morning no problem. Headed for the mall after work
to see if Robinsons/May had some shoes I could get with my shiny new
$50 giftcard (no joy there) and headed home.

On the freeway, rain pouring down, the fuse popped again. Oddly enough
the engine backfired at the same moment... Probably due to the sudden
lack of spark. Luckily I had enough momentum (and hazard lights!) to
move off to the shoulder without getting killed.

Did the fuse dance again (with my last fuse!!) and decided to wire in
a manual switch. I needed more fuses too so I headed for the nearest
FLAPS. When I got there I bought some more fuses and determined to fix
it once and for all.

Troubleshooting done there:
- Switch works fine in slow mode.
- Fuse blows either immediately or after a few miles even if I don't
try the other modes.
- Disconnecting the green wire from the 6-wire connector doesn't
affect slow mode, but seems to stop fuse blowing.

YAY!!!! 

If I can make it all day tomorrow then I can declare success! And this
weekend I can dismantle the switch to see if there's a carbon track or
a loose connection causing the short.

Wish me luck! 

BTW: Both the wife and I agree that the way I was able to get the bus
running when in the middle of the road in like 3 minutes (felt like
hours) and to safety should give me some good confidence about the
drive to Denver. =D
