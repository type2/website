Subject: Re: Buses FS (CT/MA/NY area) 1977 Bus in Clinton, CT

Searchers beware. As advertised:

VW CAMPER 77, mint condition, custom wood cabinets, new stereo,


3500 miles on rebuilt engine, runs excellent, many extras, customized


wooden luggage rack, $4000. (860) 669-1822. Clinton


Reality:

1977 VW camper far from mint condition. Problems include a badly repaired front 
panel (rust under bondo with cracks big enough for my pinkie), rust along seams 
between panels, under door sills, under windshield (which is cracked), paint was 
brushed over most rust, engine was rebuilt in 1991 and has over 40K and is 
ROUGH, entire engine and exhaust was painted silver to hide the corrosion, 
clutch is going, has a nice $150 tape deck though ;-)

I called this guy before driving 1.5 hours to see the bus. He assured me that it 
was in primo condition. If it hadn't been such a pretty drive, I think I would 
have left him in a shallow grave. He had book of the receipts for the bus going 
back to 1991, but curiously, none for the engine rebuild. Judging by the 
appearance and performance of the engine I guessed at 50K. He offered to fax me 
receipts for the engine work. To my surprise, he did, but they proved that his 
3500 mile claim was off by some 37,000+ miles. The bus is worth under $500. Its 
owner is from Mars.
