Subject: opinions on what Dizzy I should use

Hi,

i just put a 2.0 hydraulic in my '72 westy.  I am running Dellorto 36's, stock 1800 heads with the big valves and I am having a problem where the engine is cutting out above 3200rpm's.  I currently have a 009 Dizzy in there.  I checked the archives and found some talk about the downsides of the 009.  I have yet to determine what is causing my spark to become erratic, but I am guessing it is the points or dizzy itself.

Question:  Should I use a stock vacuum advance?  If so what one is recommended for my engine?  I do have a base plate vacuum port on the left side (3/4) carb so that is not an issue.

I am new to the board, so thanks in advance!

Paul.
