Subject: Re: [T2] Thermostat- to fit or not to fit?

Hiya Matt,

The engine was designed to run with the thermostat in place.  To remove that 
thermostat would imply that your sources know more about VW engine cooling 
than the engineering/design team at Wolfsburg.  You know, the people who 
designed and refined the cooling system over a forty year span using their 
accumulated knowledge, a rigorous testing program, and actual feedback from 
vehicles in the field all over the world.  The people who produced the 
engine, slapped a warantee on it and said, &quot;We guarantee this will work!&quot;  If 
that is the case and your sources at your local scrap yards and restoration 
companies do know more than the combined resources of Volkswagen AG, then 
don't bother with the thermostat.
