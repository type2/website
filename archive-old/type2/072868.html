if your seatbelts are flopping around the cab, why not simply REPLACE the
little white hooks that you hang them on :)?
these mount just behind the seat, on the door pillar... often have a round
mushroom-ish part on top where the screw goes.
wcm makes them; i got mine from my local mechanic for $6/pair, and i'm sure
they can be had cheaper.
