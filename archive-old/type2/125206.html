Subject: Re: [T2] poor fuel mileage

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;David Parisi&quot;


.  Bus now has with a 2000cc motor with solid lifters,  1800cc
&gt; heads,  modified cam providing extra .025&quot; lift, and a single weber
&gt; progressive carburetor.  Old motor got 18-22 mpg, new motor gets 11mpg.
&gt;   Have done everything I know to try to increase fuel mileage including
&gt; new plugs, wires, points, valve adjustments, and even different size
&gt; carburetor jets.  Bus runs well when warm,  hesitates when cold.  I
&gt; have recently noticed while pressing on brakes, rpms increase.  I
&gt; replaced vacuum hose from intake manifold to brake servo booster and
&gt; did not help.  I believe power brake booster diaphragm to be leaking.
&gt; Would this cause such poor fuel mileage?  or am i missing something?
&gt; Total advance timing is set a 30 degrees.

What distributor do you have? It sounds like the dreaded 009, but even with
an 009 the total advance is low for a T4 engine. With no vacuum advance the
total advance should be up around 34 - 36 degrees. With a single vac advance
the peak timing advance should be around 40 or 45 degrees when the throttle
is opened; when the vacuum stabilizes it drops to around 34 degrees. This
assumes an idle timing of 7.5 degrees.

My 74 with an 1800, weber progressive, and SVDA distributor gets 15 in the
city and 20 on the highway. Not quite your former numbers, but better than
11!

Good luck,
Dave
