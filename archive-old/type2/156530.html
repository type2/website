Subject: Re: [T2] bike racks

I have one I bought used at a bike shop for $20. I just couldn't  justify a $300 bike rack!   It works the same way and I'm very  pleased.  It has straps and I secure it to the ladder rack I  fashioned for my pop top.  Seems to be very secure and easy to  remove to use the rear hatch.  If you look around in second hand  shops (the original poster), you can probably find a rack that will  work. I've seen several there.  Cheers....KR

neighborhood one day along with some elephant ear truck mirrors.
it hangs on the drip rail or on the hatch, I prefer the drip rail, and has
rubber feet that rest 2 on the window and 2 on the hatch.
it works well and easy and it was the right price. :)
I dont know if I would want to hang bikes on it for a long trip, i might
though, for around town and our typical day or overnight outings it is
great though.
