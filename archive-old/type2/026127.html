I'm sending this again - it didn't make it to the list the first time.
Apologies if it comes out twice.

Folks, my bus has started making an interesting noise which I would like to
share with you.  It doesn't always happen but is annoying because I don't
know what it is.
About a second after I push the clutch in, there is a clunk (well more like
a flap) which seems to come from around the front of the trans.  It has
nothing to do with changing gear and only happens with drive engaged (ie not
in neutral).
If it's a clutch thing, it's not like anything I've heard before.  I thought
the trans mount might be loose but I checked the bolts and they are OK.  One
of my CV boots is split but I can't feel any play or wear in the CV.  Could
it be something to do with this anyway?  I'm going to take the brake drums
off soon to check what work needs doing there.  I doubt if it is the brakes
that are the problem but I'm open to suggestions.
Any ideas?
Oh, and there is some play in one of the rear wheels so that probably needs
new bearings as well, it looks like I'm going to be pretty much rebuilding
the entire rear end.
