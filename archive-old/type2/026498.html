&gt;I sugest that if you have an oil hose long enough to reach up to the 
&gt;left air intake of the engine compartment (i mean the one on the left 
&gt;upper side) you should put it there. There it's protected against 
&gt;everything and has always a nice airflow cooling it. Well i think it 

I highly recommend NOT mounting an oil cooler inside your air scoops!  Where
do you think all that hot air is going after it cools your oil?  I'll tell
you where.  It's being drawn into your engine's cooling system and blown
across your stock oil cooler, your heads and your cylinders, that's where.
Kind of defeats the purpose of an external oil cooler.  

If you've got to have an external oil cooler (I still firmly believe that
the stock cooler is quite adequate for a good-running stock type IV motor),
find a nice spot up under the bus somewhere and go for it.  If your planned
location is not well protected (remember, you need air flow in order for
this bird to do any good) then build a heavy-duty wire-mesh cage to protect
it and the oil lines from road debris.

Just my opinion.
