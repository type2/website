Subject: 3rd gear synchro bad

Put a used 4-spd into my '82 Westy today,  good news is that all gears
work fine without
the loud whine my old tranny was making,  bad news is that the 3rd gear
syncro seems to
be non-functional.  Is is possible to have a single syncro into a tranny
at a reasonable cost?  or should I just wait and afford a newly rebuilt
tranny?

Perhaps I can get used to double clutching like in the pre-syncronized
days.  At least now I have a core for a rebuild with a somewhat
functional bus 'till then.

Also can get at my parts bus and get a few parts going for others on the
list.
