Hi,

&gt; ... I recall reading somewhere that that Bolt shoulder angle is
&gt; different for Merc and VW rims.  Perhaps someone can confirm or deny this,
&gt; and perhaps the solution is to use Merc lug nuts, if the thread patterns
are
&gt; the same as VW.  Perhaps someone can let us know?

 I think this changed in the early eighties or thereabouts. Prior to that 
Mercedes used 14mm studs and nuts (like VW) but later models used 12mm
bolts. AFAIK the shoulder patterns are fundamentally the same (I think 
its a &quot;spherical&quot; profile) but obviously they are different sizes.
 I should also say that &quot;AFAIK&quot; isn't very far at all!!!

 I'm running 7&quot; Mercedes rims. I havn't noticed which year bus we're
discussing here but I'm pretty sure that all the disc braked ones
(ie the ones with a Mercedes pcd) had a 39mm offset. Note that the
Haynes manual lists it as 41mm but appears to be wrong.

 When I was researching this I was looking for 15&quot; wheels, but I
don't think that any of them came with a 39mm offset. OTOH it
seems that a few millimetres error isn't problematic. You can,
as others have posted, correct an offset that's slightly too
large with spacers but not one that's too small.

 As I posted previously I have no spacers at the front wheels,
which results in a 5mm error (wheels too far in) and 6mm spacers
at the rear, which result in a 1mm error (wheels too far out). 
I havn't noticed any ill effects, the change in tyre and tyre 
sized making more difference than the offset change, it would appear.
 Note that, as indicated elsewhere, VW fitted 30mm offset alloys
to the Vanagon with no apparant qualms.

 I have 195/70R15C tyres fitted with no clearance problems. I think
that 205/65s would be OK, too, though they'd be pretty close to my
(oversized) front anti-roll bar, so I might need to try and get
the offset corrected completely to obviate any rubbing at
full lock.

 Finding wheels to match all the parameters seems to be well 
nigh impossible. Getting mine to fit involved drilling out the
12mm bolt holes to clear my 14mm studs and replacing my studs
with longer ones to get adequate thread engagement (the 
mounting face of the alloys is 20mm thicker than that of the 
stock VW steel ones). I wasn't able to find front studs long
enough to use spacers at the front (the stock front studs are
10mm longer than the rears) but I actually need to have
spacers at the rear, now, if I want to use the stock wheels
again, as there isn't enough thread on the rear studs to 
let the nuts seat properly. It's not perfect, but it's
close enough for me.

 Ideally you want 112mm pcd, 39mm offset, no significant 
depth on the mounting face, 14mm stud holes with a ball
profile on the nut seats, strength with light weight 
and the appropriate diameter and width for your needs.
 I think that some of the earlier 14&quot; Merc wheels match
the pcd, 14mm studs and depth but I don't think they are
39mm. If they are close you might be OK but the stock 
studs don't give much scope for offset-correction using 
spacers. Longer studs are hard to source and quite 
pricey (at least in the UK). Pelican Parts, a Florida
based Porsche specialist seems to have a range, if you
can live with their prices.

 I hope this is helpful. Please get in touch if I can
clarify anything. The biggest problem seems to be 
finding out the exact details of the wheels that
you have access to so that you can assess the work
involved in mounting them. I have come to the 
conclusion that there is no easy answer along the
lines of &quot;The wheels from a 19?? Mercedes ???? fit
perfectly!&quot; because if there was such an answer it
would be known to someone on the list and hence be
common knowledge and a FAQ.

Cheers,
	 W.
