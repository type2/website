Subject: Re: [T2] OIl Cooling

 &gt;I think I'd like to start driving my Bus a bit more now that I've, 
for the most part, finished it. I'm nervous about proper cooling, and 
I'd like to know what some things I can do to improve cooling, and 
add more oil capacity.

Before adding oil cooling capacity have you checked everything else 
is ok? For example:

- timing. I notice you state you have a mechanical advance dizzy. A 
009 I presume? I have read on many occasions that you either need to 
replace it with an SVDA dizzy or limit its maximum advance to around 28 degrees
- vacuum leaks. If you have a 009 the vacuum port on the weber needs 
to be blocked off
- valve clearances
- points gap/dwell
- spark plug gaps/condition
- firing on all cylinders
- compression
- carb jetting (too lean?)

I'm sure there is other stuff but that's a good start ;)

Cheers,

Martin.
