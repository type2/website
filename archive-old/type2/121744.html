Subject: Re: [T2] voltage regulator toasted

While appreciate and usually quietly agree with Doktor Tim's viewpoints on
original equipment and longevity, I'll chime in on this one.  I replaced my
failed original voltage regulator in my 73 Westy in early 2000 with the
Wells VR650 solid-state unit from Autozone for about $14.  4 years later and
no problems.  I expect it'll last 15 years or more and that's long enough
for me.  Let's face it, a new solid-state voltage regulator is either going
to work or it isn't.  I got the info for the part number from David Schwarze
way back in 99 so I know he's been running his at least that long.  And I
know several people with 914s that have been running these for years with no
problems and I can tell you the 914 engine bay environment makes the bus
engine bay enviroment look like a safe-zone!
