Subject: RE: [T2] Champagne edition bus (any owners on the list?)

As promised, here are some photos of my father's 77 Champagne edition Bus,
complete with the photo of the Champagne Edition sticker.

It's kinda odd that the interior isn't as brown as everyone else seems to
be. Maybe because his was an earlier one? As far as I can tell it's stock,
with only this digital clock on the dash, but that may be after market.

The outside is brown with a creme top, and creme wheels.

Enjoy
