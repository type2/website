I have a customer in need of some engine work. We are provider her with
pistons/cylinders, and rebuilt heads ect. for her 77, she needs someone to
install them for her. A local mechanic wanted $3000 for the whole job (that
probably included parts). Is there anyone on the list that can vouch for
this area? Thanks a bunch. We are thinking about offering a rebuild service
(non-hotrod), just quality stock rebuilds someday. Any suggestions on this
as well would be greatly appreciated.
