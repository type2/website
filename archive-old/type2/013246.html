Recently I attended a BugFest in Ennis Texas.
The night before a group of approximately 10 VW vans Westfalias camped
overnight at the Bardwell Resivoir six miles outside of Ennis. 
I got there about 3:30 in the afternoon and there were already seven or
eight vans there. I checken in and got spot #49, which is a great
location under a big shade tree. While returning to pay for the spot
after I confirmed it was empty a 1998 EuroVan took my spot. Not wanting
to cause any discomfort I just took spot #48 right next to it but without
any of the desirable qualities of my favorite spot #49.
Almost all of the other van owners came around within fifteen or twenty
minutes and greeted me and we all went to greet the EuroVan folks at spot
#49.
They were hospitable enough but not the general friendly folks you find
on the *list*.
I don't think they ever heard of the list or the BugFest taking place the
next day.
I think that we, as a group of very casual males and two females, kind-of
shocked them.
Well I didn't mention to them that they took my spot and everybody else
just greeted them and after a few moments we strolled off to other parts.
The thing I noticed after we left their area is that they lowered their
pop-up, disconnected their water and electricity and stayed ready to
escape all that evening. They spent the night as we all did but I think
that they thought they had just arrived at Hippie Hell or something.
So remember guys and gals there are Vanagon, TypeII and EuroVanners that
don't relate to VW owners who drive their classics and collectables on a
daily basis. Their VW EvroVan by Winnebago as just a low cost RV for them
and they aren't joiners of VW Clubs, Events, Lists or trip tales.
