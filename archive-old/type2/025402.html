&gt;&gt; At 1000 rpm there is no hunting. Dwell is at 44, but I'm not sure how to
&gt;&gt; adjust this. Is this a matter of adjusting points? I adjusted the points per
&gt;&gt; spec. I am used to a pointless ignition, so dwell is something new to me.
&gt; 
&gt; As points age, the amount of gap they need to get tp 50 degrees dwell
&gt; becomes less and less. A new set requires .016&quot; gap; I always change them
&gt; when the gap becomes less than .010&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, you could always send The Bus Depot or aircooled_dot_net a few
&gt; dollars and come away with a points eliminator, which will solve this
&gt; problem for good.

Sorry about that folks, points are new and set to .016. Dist cap, rotor,
plugs, wires all new, all gapped to spec., all Bosch.

I set the advance with the 050 distributor to 26 degrees at 3100, which
brings the engine from 7.5 degrees before to about 5 degrees after TDC.

Isn't this supposed to be how you set timing, by the total advance for the
distributor you are using? I found in the library a total advance of 26
degrees at 3100 rpm for this distributor.

I think this is how it works, it did smooth out at idle somewhat, but still
hunting...
