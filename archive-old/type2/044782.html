Subject: Re: [T2] Heater Fan

Matt,

The fan is controlled by a funky switch at the bottom of the Heater control
lever.  This switch can be replaced with a toggle switch to ground if you want
the power of control.  The switch grounds the relay on the fan mount and the
relay supplies the power to the fan.
