I have no problem using Vise-grips either except..... it depends on the
brand of them. Cheap Taiwan crap will get you in trouble:)  Good ones like
Vise-Grip brand or Craftsman work very well. Some 'cheap' tools you can get
will work just fine, i.e. hammers. Others break, bend, slip, crack, etc.


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried Vice-grips unsuccessfully, but didn't damage anything with
&gt; &gt; 'em, you might try that, possibly with a hex tool in the pocket so you
&gt; &gt; don't collapse it.
&gt;
&gt;  I had good luck with vice grips when pulling CVs from a junkyard bus
&gt; to use as spares.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; W.
