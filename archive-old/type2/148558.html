Subject: Re: [T2] Total advance 3500rpm

OK,

I'm trying to follow along here, still a bit confused. Can we clarify
a bit? Since I'm about to go out this afternoon and adjust my timing
I'm hoping a can get a firm understanding. Let me give it a try...

OK. To start off with. I've got a '71 with a DP 1600. Solex 34PICT3.
Valves are set correctly. Dwell is about 50 (I'll have to check this
first before doing anything with the timing, of course). Distributor
is the CIP1 Bruck which has the part number  113905205AN.

Here's the info for that distributor part number from
http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm :

_____________________________

OK. First thing that's got me confused is this, &quot;Timing Set At:: 5deg
ATDC w/ vacuum hose(s) connected&quot;. Almost everything I've read says to
time the single vacuum advance distributor at 7.5deg BTDC.  I thought
the distributors that were set at 5deg ATDC were usually the dual
vacuum models.

Should I throw out my assumption that this distributor indeed matched
the specs of the 113905205AN and follow my gut instinct to set this at
7.5deg BTDC at idle?

OK. So lets say I set everything at 7.5deg BTDC at idle. Then I should
get 7.5 + (22 to 25) = 29.5 - 32.5 deg BTDC at 3500 RPM? correct? And
my timing at WOT with the vacuum hose connected or disconnected should
be about the same because I should have little vacuum on that vacuum
port at WOT? Also my timing at idle should be roughly the same with or
without vacuum at idle for the same reason - no vacuum?

Also, one more thing, is 7.5 BTDC at idle roughly the same as setting
my timing statically to 7.5deg BTDC? Just curious.

Why did I buy the Bruck Dizzy? It's making me dizzy. I think I should
have stuck with the genuine Bosch, then I could at least be more sure
the distributor specs matched the actual part. The not knowing is not
really worth it for the $20 I saved.
