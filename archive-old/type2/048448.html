Subject: Re: [T2] Acessory Question on a 70(lifting cmpr top)

Just wondering, does your bus have the two metal interlocking pieces, one on the
inside front center of the fiberglass top and the other on the front center of
the roof?  Both of my '71's had them. They seem to do an adequate job of securing
the front of the top to the roof.   I have never had any problems with the roof
lifting.

&gt; I have a similar question as to the front of the top lifting.
&gt; I have bought a set of rubber hold down clamps to install so the top does not
&gt; lift in the wind.
&gt; Someone previously posted about a hold-down system with adjusting screws,
&gt; I at times have felt that a heater boost would be a good idea and if anyone
&gt; has installed a booster fan please post.
