Subject: It just died -Update 2- revised

Hallo,
It's me. Again. I don't know why this won't format correctly. Anyway, the 
results of the compression test are as follows: #1=98 (dry), 107 (wet); 
#2=125 (dry), 132 (wet); #3=84 (dry), 89 (wet); #4=107 (dry), 115 (wet). The 
compression rose steadily on all cylinders with no jerks...(except for me). 
Could the oil pressure switch have anything to do with it? If it's b/o does 
it not send a signal to the fuel pump? Any thoughts? Any rags? Any bones? 
Any bottles, today?

Curious,
Klotheshoff
