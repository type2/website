*reprints are published on thick cover stock, printed both
sides (like originals) in grey-scale and drilled for 3-ring
binder style insertion.  Actually, better than the originals
as the pages are grease resistant and are much tougher than OEM.

 Huh?  Is Busbones closing shop???  Nope, not on your life!
 But we ARE gonna be moving, and that's always a pain in the ....
 I'd hoped we could sell this stuff by the pound with
 discounts for folks who came with tractor trailers...
 Accountant says uhn-uhn!
 However, excess inventory and tools need to go to make way
 for NEW inventory and NEW tools... yada, yada, yada!

 WEBNOTES: On top of all the other craziness that s been going
 on over the last few months we're also in the process of
 shifting format from our current style website, to a new, monthly
 magazine.  We'll keep you posted on the changeover dates
 and look forward to your feedback on reaction to the new site....
 Our current website address: www.busbones_dot_com will be active until
 well after the new site is up-n-running...
