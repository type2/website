Subject: Re: [T2] Powder coating - more

If you ad researched this a little more you would have found a product
by Dupont--Vari Prime acid etch zinc chromate  primer--it sticks to
anything---
It's an excellent barrier coat, sealer, and a lock down primer, on steel
aluminum, stainless, fiberglass, lead, cast iron, tin cans, etc.  

Plastic coat stuff is spray can stuff--- low or no build primer.--

Lots of time and money spent on not much for results.

If you guys want pro paint advise ask me before you go crazy with some
miracle in a can idea--it may be costlier--but I'll steer you down the
right path--then you can make your own decision on how you want to do
it--

Love and kisses,

TK--

The can pictured on the left is primer for non-ferrous metals. But the
can on the right, zinc rich, says it is for steel. I see no info for
it......

Now I have read more,, 
I hate finding out what I did 10 years ago worked fine, but the mfgr
says not! 
seems the web page states the primer is good on Non ferrous metals!

I guess I shouldn't have painted my ferrous wheels and bumpers with that
! 
They still look good in my books!
