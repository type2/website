        Once it's hot, it's hot. I was surprised at that too -- even more
surprised when I moved to Alabama from WI and found that the heads didn't
get any hotter there in Summer than they did in WI in Winter. And really it
doesn't take them very long to get hot. What I do see is a difference in
head temp from full out 70+ highway speed and around town speed. Or even
dropping down to 55 for awhile lowers head temp at least 25 degrees.
      At any rate, there is a much larger difference in head temp due to
speed than there is for outside temp, although possibly in real cold
outside temps and a slow drive for a short distance the heads might not get
quite as hot, but it seems to me that regardless, the heads are up to
350-400 within a few blocks.
