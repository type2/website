Subject: Re: [T2] John Brown's Buses may have saved my bus

&gt;     It's all over.  John Brown's Buses 2004 came to a close today.  I said good bye to the Canadian carabus that was five strong
&gt; around 12:30.  The turn out exceeded my wildest dreams for this year.  Including day trippers coming locally, there were 50 buses
&gt; total. I feel like we spent an entire year together (according to the weather) We saw sunshine, overcast skies, gushing winds, rain,
&gt; temperatures ranging from moderate to bone chilling.

and it was that weather that is the story.

  I was supposed to be in Philadelphia on Sat from 10-6PM but begged off
and came to JBB.  if I would have left Philadelphia at 6PM I would have
been headed South on I-95 about 25 miles North of Baltimore when a major
storm hit, the largest accident in Maryland history occured with over 70
vehicles involved, I would have very likely been right there at that time
when vehicles started sliding.  seems there was a hail storm, then
suddenly the sun came out, and between the slick road and the blinding
glare of sunlight off the ice the cars and trucks started going every
which way, the accident covered 11 miles of roadway and closed I-95 for
several hours.  State Police claims it was a miracle that no one was
killed, although there were 40 or so injuries, most minor.

not to say the roads from JBB were easy, a tree had been blown down across
US 340 just into Virginia and there were a couple minor accidents along
I-70 but all in all I got back without any problems other than being even
slower than normal.

I hope everyone else got home with no hassles, and again Jamie, THANKS for
a great experience.

Bob
