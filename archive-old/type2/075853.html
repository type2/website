Subject: Re: [T2]  locking engine hatch + FIRES  TRUE

My whole purpose of the original post was something that someone else pointed out
in a reply: How prone is the bus to an engine fire compared to other cars if the
fuel lines are changed (and clamped :)

Yes, there are always the special circumstances, but overall, are there any other
major fire hazards other than old fuel lines.  And yes, being the fact that it is
a 20 year old car and ANYTHING can break puts it slighly ahead of the rest in the
fire hazard.. I'll admit that..

&gt; Let's see a hose popping off it's connection, yes clamp the fuel lines but it
&gt; can still happen and Electrical fires happen too.  There may be the chance
&gt; that you can catch the fire early enough to put it out yourself.  Which is all
&gt; I want to do.  If you have to call the fire dept, odds are the fire has been
&gt; burning for a while and by that time I agree the engine lid would be too hot
&gt; to open.  But when it first starts, you may have a chance and a chance is
&gt; better than nothing.
&gt;
&gt; For me an unlocked engine compartment door when driving.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi John Here
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Sorry but any Fireman approaching a VW bus will not open the lid, so
&gt; don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; worry about the lock. I lock mine because of my security system is back
&gt; &gt; &gt; there. I know when I am on the move my lid is not locked because I usually
&gt; &gt; &gt; check the oil before I move out. Firemen will approach and shoot foam or
&gt; &gt; &gt; other material through the engine vent intake. The lid keeps o2 from the
&gt; &gt; &gt; fire. Besides if its on fire I don't think you can go near that lid, too
&gt; dame
&gt; &gt; &gt; hot!
