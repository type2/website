&gt; &gt; Last week, I won an 'auction' for some new tail light assemblies
&gt; &gt; for my '78 from a gent in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  (Apparently someone
&gt; &gt; with an &quot;in&quot; -- he's always sellin' &quot;new&quot; Bus stuff...)
&gt;
&gt;I know this guy and have bought several items from him direct, they are
&gt;always good quality for Brazilian parts.


At least you knew before hand you were buying Brazilian parts.

Having wanted to replace my rear turn signal/brake housings for a long time 
due to corroded bulb contacts, I finally order new stuff from Bus Depot. 
The lenses were clearly marked as Brazilian on the web site and in the 
catalog as a separate part. The housings, however, were only identified 
with the VW part no., again as a separate item. I assumed that meant they 
were VW parts because they did not offer to mention those were Brazilian as 
well. Shame on me for assuming an honest presentation.

What I received was lenses and housings shrink wrapped together as a whole 
unit, all made in Brazil. Note the catalog does not show the two items sold 
as a unit. The lenses look fine. The housings, however, are nothing like 
originals. I haven't looked into it further but am hoping I can remove the 
metal contacts and install them in my original housings. Just know for sure 
that if Bus Depot shows a German VW part no., it does not follow that you 
will get a real part. Same goes for most vendors. I consider this 
deceptive, but par for the course in todays market. Really no different 
than when you ask the quicky lube if they use a VW filter for your oil 
change, they say yes, and then they put a Havoline or Quaker State filter 
on there. After all, Havoline and Quaker state list it as a VW filter in 
their catalog, so it's not really lying, is it???
