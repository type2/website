Subject: T2: Reconnecting emissions


'Morning all!

My first post, hazah!

My name's Dano Fagan.  I have a beautiful blue 1973 Bus.  I purchased it about 1 year ago in sunny Florida and its been the most reliable auto I've ever owned.

The engine was rebuilt some time before I bought it, and Florida being the warm and relatively smog free state that it is, the emissions and heat were never reconnected.

Now I find myself traveling from sunny Florida to cool Boston.  Since the temperatures are declining I decided it was time to reconnect the heat.  I've successfully reconnected the heat, but is smells like the engine compartment and I worry somewhat about suffocating.

There is where my plea for help comes in.  I think the next step would be to reconnect some of the emissions equipment.

A complete explanation with pictures can be found at:

And here's the textual version of the same thing:
I have a weber progressive carburetor.  Everything appears to be hunky dory, aside from a hose connector that isn't connected to anything.  It bypasses the air filter, letting whatever gas that gets pumped through it directly to the valves/barrels/whatever the chamber with the butterfly valves are called.  Any ideas what it connects to?

I have a completely disconnected charcoal filter.  I've figured out where the gas vapor hose goes, and that the left side connects to the left hand side of the engine through a hose.  This is currently unconnected at the moment, because I have absolutely no idea where the right hand port on the charcoal filter connects to.  Any idea where it goes?

Lastly, I have a crankcase breather that vents directly into the engine compartment.  And I have no idea what to connect it to.  I've thought about connecting it to the extra weber connector, but I notice the throttle return spring (passing by the open mouth of the breather) has a gummy coat oil.  So I nixed it, thinking it may gum up the carb too.  Any ideas what to connect it to?

Comments and questions are welcome about anything.  I'm on the road; if y'all can CC: my email &lt;crazymug_at_cheerful_dot_com&gt; your responses that would be great.  I'll respond as soon as I can, circumstances and Internet access permitting.

Incidentally, I an currently passing through North Carolina in the Asheville area.  It is amazingly beautiful this time of year.  If in future years you find yourself with needing someplace to go, I highly recommend a visit to this area!

Thanks,
Dano!
