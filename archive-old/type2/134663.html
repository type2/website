 This is what scares me. Many yards, especially here in SoCal, don't
hang on to vehicles for any length of time. This means that they end
up in the crusher.
 
 Sigh.

Correct. Here in Fresno, Calif. the self serve yards are in business for the scrap.
The vehicles stand out for about 2 weeks in rows. When the time is up, a new row 
replaces the old one and they all get crushed. Does not matter what is in the row. A row 
of imports can have any thing in it, from a Benz to a Yugo. To them, an engine is an engine.
A row of trucks can have a VW bus or a Caddy Escalade.... when its time is up, crusher.
Scrap weight is all it is.  Anything they sell off it is gravy.
