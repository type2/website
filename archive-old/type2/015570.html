Try contacting the VW Mag staff. They tend to like to be helpful to both
readers and advertisers in their articles and classifieds. Most people make
this upgrade and use the Porsche pattern so they can mount Fuchs wheels.
Can you say, 'lowest possible unsprung weight' which gives you better
suspension responce to go along with the excellent braking.

&gt;	Hello List,
&gt;Not so recently, I was perusing a VW Mag and noticed a kit being sold for
&gt;the venerable pre-disk brake transporter that retained the large 5 lug bolt
&gt;pattern, yet used 911 rotors and calipers.   It is the one 'necessary'
upgrade I would
&gt;like to tackle, and I want to retain the stock bolt pattern as per the
&gt;advertisement.  Any info will be greatly appreciated!
