Subject: Re: [T2] Friday- bus sighting

&gt; I saw a tampax, yes tampax, commercial yesterday with the girl at the end dancing on top of a pink Westy!

I did not see this one but....
I was watching a movie on pay-per-view, Bad Boys II. About 30 mins into it during a big chase, the car hauler
runs into the left rear of a parked Sage green 76-78 Westy. Totally destroys the Westy. It is a quick scene as
the whole chase is rather long.
