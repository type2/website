Subject: Re: [T2] Starting troubles in San Diego

&gt;San   Diego locals, I could really use a
&gt;recommendation for a shop in the Clairemont/La Jolla
&gt;area.

BRU Automotive, on University.  They do mostly air
coolers. I don't know of any air cooled shop in
Clairemont, and La Jolla would be unlikely.

I think there are other shops in El Cajon and National
City, but I've never used them.
