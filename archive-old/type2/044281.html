Subject: Fw: [T2] bucking at low throttle problem (please read)

christopher wrote-
&gt;I need some advice.  My '77 FI bucks as if missing when I drive with the
&gt;throttle anywhere between all the way up and floored.  In neutral the motor
&gt;revs up fine and I can hold it at half throttle and it doesn't miss.  It
&gt;only bucks when the motor is under a load.  If I floor it or let all the way
&gt;up it stops bucking.
this is the dreaded AFM problem. carefully peel the cover and you will see
the bad trace. don't touch it. if you can get a new PCB,that would be great...
and the meter checks for the AFM often don't reveal the problem, they just
give basic continuity parameters...

&gt;  Does the ECU have any way of knowing full
&gt;throttle besides the AFM (...as it runs fine at full throttle)?


as already mentioned, the microswitch on the throttle body is the
full throttle signal...
one more possibility is to check the grounds at the case center rear and at
 the firewall near the double relay...
