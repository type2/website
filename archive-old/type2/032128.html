&gt; The father of a friend of ours was stationed in India during WWII as a
&gt; dispatch rider and they had supplies difficulties, so the mechanics
&gt; fitted mahogany pistons to their Harleys and BSA Goldstars. At least it
&gt; would be easy to turn them down a bit for fit!   

Hi, Gillian and Bob--

My father was in India and Burma [as it was called then] during WWII, and
one of his momentos was a wooden distributor cap.  Swiping the caps during
the night was a favorite way for the Other Side to disable convoys, so
the fellows on the machinist's truck developed a jig for the lathe and
drill press and simply turned them out as needed.  

I know it's unrealistic, but I always thought that swiping distributor
caps sounded like such a comparatively reasonable way to fight a war. My
mother was worried for him when he was there, but the truth finally came
out that the greatest wartime danger he faced was hunting wild boar off
the back of a jeep with a mounted machine gun.

Happy Friday.
