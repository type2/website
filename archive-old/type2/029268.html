Man, I got those '71/'72 front brake caliper blues.

I can't find nothin' on the market to hold my shoes (discs, actually),

I need my poor ride so I can put my brother-in-law's truck to the side.

Pleaaase hep me y'all...
I got those seventy-one/seventy-two...
Common man, ain't y'all got a clue...
Those 71/72 front brake caliper bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuues!

Here's the deal. If'n I can get the spindles off a later year, I can get the calipers for a '77 in this package deal I'm putting together. Otherwise, I need the calipers off a '71 or '72.

If any of you are parting out a '71 or '72 bus, please keep me in mind. I appreciate it! Joe
