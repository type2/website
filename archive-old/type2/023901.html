&gt; Your driving environment will be different from
&gt; mine, of course, I just	want to	explain	my reasoning (and invite
&gt; comment,
&gt; as always :-). Stephen Foster described	120mph in his bus as a white
&gt; knuckle
&gt; ride- I	wonder if this is a factor (after all, his is set up for
&gt; offroad use).
	&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Stephen is from Australia where roads are generally wide and often lightly
&gt; travelled (huge	generalisation,	I know..) and his bus is set up	to
&gt; leave them
&gt; anyway so I suspect that on-road handling wasn't a priority. My
&gt; driving	is
&gt; on the narrow, often twisty and	quite densely trafficked roads in
&gt; the UK so
&gt; handling is pretty crucial for me. Maybe this will help	judge what
&gt; might work
&gt; well for you. I'd certainly be interested to hear what you decide and why.
&gt; 
	Thought I should just add a quick comment to this.  Yep the bus is
setup for offroad use but as it's my daily driver it see's a lot of going to
work and back sorta trips. So it is a bit of a compromise.  I'm running
adjustable Koni shocks and front and rear sway bars to help keep it stable
on the road.

	When I said it was a &quot;white knuckle ride&quot; at 120mph (Geez, wouldn't
most buses be??) it was more a mental thing for me.  The Bus actually sat
well on the road and handled Ok but it isn't really the right shape for that
sorta thing, and the speedo is well off the clock by then which doesn't
instil a lot of confidence.  Normal driving at say 70 or 80mph is just fine,
I really think at 120mph the tires are not the main concern.  I was more
worried about stopping!!! or being stop by the local constabulary (this is a
get locked up speed in OZ as I imagine it is in most parts of the world)

	I think the very stiff sidewalls of these tires help a great deal in
compensating for the raised c of g.  Anyway, thats it.

	Oh yeah, It's so confusing now with another &quot;Stephen Foster&quot; on the
list ;)

	Cheers

	Steve
