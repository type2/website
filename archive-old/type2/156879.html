&gt; What kind of bug do you drive? I've heard the bug folk say a super handles

&gt; you think?

I have a '69 standard.  I've never driven a Super, so have no input there.
I know that I don't particularly like swing axle VWs, as they seem to be
going a different direction every time you hit a bump.

&gt; Also had someone bring up a question of whether gas cans stowed on a bus
&gt; rear bumper would get too hot from the engine heat. What do you think on
&gt; that one?

I doubt that the gas would get too hot, unless you got rear-ended!  :0
