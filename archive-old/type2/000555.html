Hi all, Mr whipy is getting loads of welding this week so I hope I'm ready
for the first of July for the body work &amp; paint-work. One of the list
members has sent me a MPG Speedo, so I'm well pleased :)

I would like to lower the bus, not into the &quot;weeds&quot;, but for stability etc.
As you might know, Mr Whipy is a factory high-top &amp; this makes him e'fing
twitchy in crosswinds!

I do _NOT_ want to start a FART!
I do _NOT_ need to know where you got them.
I do _NOT_ need to know what make of tyre you have.
I do _NOT_ need to know the nice pattern of tread you have.
I do _NOT_ need to know how much you paid.
I do _NOT_ need to know how long they lasted.
I do _NOT_ need to know how many 'ply' they are.

Sorry if this offends you but I HATE tyre FARTS &amp; do not want the wrath of
Steve on me ;)

I have a couple of ideas

1/
Lower the back a couple of splines, if so how many?

2/
Lower the front a bit by fitting low profile tyres, if so what size?

3/
Have the bus lowered by cutting the beam.

------------------------------------------------------------

Now should I fit a thicker anti-roll bar?

How much will I affect the Speedo, by fitting low profile tyres?

Should I use the fact that low profiles are more pliable to make the ride
softer, or fit different shocks?

If so what will a new roll-bar do to this set-up?

------------------------------------------------------------

I tried the archives, but &quot;tyres&quot; kicked out TOOOOOOOO many results &amp; I need
the whole picture. (besides we have to pay for every second of call over
here -ouch- )

Thanks for your thinking caps &amp; as I said, I don't want to offend you but
where you got your tyres is of no use as this is pure theory (&amp; I'm in the
UK)
