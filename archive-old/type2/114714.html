Some delivery models came with solid glass.

&gt;From what I can tell you, they use the exact same &gt;window seal that the
SOLID piece of glass window &gt;would use if it was installed.

From what I've read, NO bus was ever sold (in North America at least) that
didn't have some type of window opening in the middle section. 

There were no solid glass middle windows.

If you're talking about the back windows, they are a completely different
shape, so no go there.
