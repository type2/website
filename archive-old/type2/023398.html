Subject: FS: 1959 VW Bus

Saw this on a local for sale newsgroup.  This person actually works in
the same building that I do (No, I don't know him:)  If anyone is
interested, contact him, and if need be I could look at it for you
(especially if you gave me a list of things to look for:).  Anyway,
that's all.

take care,
        brandy

For sale:       1959 VW Bus (in pieces but complete)

I bought this bus several years ago with the intention of
restoring it but I just don't have the time these days.
It would probably make a good parts bus.

Currently it is completely disassembled and the body is
riding on a large dolly (comes with it).  All items are in
marked boxes/bags.  There are no serious &quot;hacks&quot; to the
body but it needs to be dipped/stripped, new rocker panels
and probably a cargo floor.

Front/rear end have been lowered (not attached to body).

Any reasonable offer will be entertained, YOU haul it away,
ALL or NONE is the deal!
