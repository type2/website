Subject: Re: Cannot remove the heater cable

Hi Bart,

Here is a solution that sounds hokey but it has worked for me. Don't 
worry about running the cable inside the tube - run it along side the 
tube and attach it to the tube with nylon cable ties that you can get at 
a flaps. Use a cable tie about every foot along the length of the tube. 
This setup has worked for me for at least 10 years. The ties might get 
brittle every 5 years or so but they are easy to replace.

I am trying to replace the old heater cable of my 1969 Transporter (Bay
Window), though I can4t because the cable with the black sheet is stuck in
the hose under the bus. Any tips to remove this thing?

Thanks,
