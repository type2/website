&gt; The engine never ran bad. It just has this annoying little miss that I
&gt; hear. It occasionally will backfire slightly when I am slowing down
&gt; also. It's a relatively new engine ( only about 3000 miles, but it is a
&gt; GEX) I know, I know! But I didn't know when I bought it so now I'm stuck
&gt; with it til it dies.
&gt;

Ooooh! I just found GEX on the web and was looking at their engines. I am
considering a new or rebuilt 2.0l air cooled for my 81 Vanagon.

Judging by this comment :) there might be some opinions around here
concerning Gex. I would love to hear about them. This is the first time I
have seen them mentioned on the list.

Thanks for any comments or input.

Regards from Utah,

John
