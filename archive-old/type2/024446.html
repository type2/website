Someone on the list has to know this. What is the correct timing for a 73
thing engine (code AM 008063)?  One kind lister has already given this info
(which I didn't know to start with).  I have backfire on deceleration
(downshift) gone through all the obvious (exhaust, enrichment, vacuum,
cleaned carb). I had the beast timed at 0 TDC, ran good but did nothing for
the backfire.  Retimed to 7.5 BTDC (as a 73 Type I would be) vacuum hoses
off and plugged, at idle.  It has helped but I still get a little backfire
on downshift into third or coast in third at reasonable speeds . Now what?
I'm gonna call Kovorkian soon, it's that bad. I don't care how my bus looks,
but it must run perfect, without so much as a hickup, but I'm failing
miserably. Single port, 30 pict 1, vacuum dist, good new exhaust.  I've seen
answers to really obscure technical questions on the list so the expertise
is out there.
