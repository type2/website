&gt; I was on the list about 4 years ago when I bought my Westfalia, but unsubbed
&gt; some time back.  Now, I need help, and I see from your website that I should
&gt; try you first for 'help' questions.... so, if you can help me by pointing me
&gt; in the right direction, I'd be most grateful!
&gt; 
&gt; The bus is a 79 Westy.
&gt; 
&gt; I need the following tranny parts, or any information about availability.
&gt; My mechanic tells me that several of these are no longer made by VW.
&gt; 
&gt; Selector Link Bracket
&gt; 
&gt; Selector Link Shaft
&gt; 
&gt; Selector Link Ball Joint
&gt; 
&gt; Gear Carrier Gasket
&gt; 
&gt; Front Nose Gasket
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks very much for any leads....
