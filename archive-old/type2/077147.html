Subject: Re: [T2] Audi/Vanagon seats in a '74?

&quot;What did they cost you? &quot;

At a local pull-a-part any seat is $25 each.  This weekend they had two nice
sets of Vanagon seats up for grabs one navy blue and the other maroon, also
a few middle and rear bench seats in Maroon cloth.  No baywindow stuff
though.  This is at the Atlanta location of pull-a-part.

I imagine the other bone yards would have similar prices.

Also from all the feedback to the original question is that '76 and newer
can use the Vanagon seats directly.


Happy Journeys,
