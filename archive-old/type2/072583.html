Subject: who sells  stock distributors?

For several years, I've been buying refurbished stock distributors from Jim
Thompson of the Old Volks Home.  Now I need one for a '71 Westy and I am
unable to reach him by phone, e-mail, or web site.
Does anyoine know if OVH is still in operation?
Is there another source for stock distributors?

Thanks
 Jack
