&gt;easier way is to hit the sign at a constant 50mph, take the difference in
&gt;mph and double it for the percentage difference.... I did it about a week
&gt;ago and got a reading of 47mph in my 78 bus, so my speedo is reading 6%
&gt;high. (50-47mph= 3x2=6%) (Michen 205/70R 14 MXT tires)

You're right, that would be easier, but most of the signs I have seen have
been in 35-40mph zones, and I didn't want to suggest that people speed past
the signs.  :)
