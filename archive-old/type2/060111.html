&gt;I'm leery of putting all that equipment on the engine. Has anyone installed
&gt;an A/C unit like you find in motorhomes (all electric - no engine mounted

Too much, unless you are parked and plugged into shore power.  However,
it's not all that difficult to put regular old engine driven A/C in a '73
bus.  I just got done doing it.  At the last Lone Star Transporter meeting,
I was all set to show it off when I was upstaged by another member who had
DUAL A/C newly installed into his 71 Westy!!  Yes, front and rear A/C with
an upright engine.  Now I truly believe that anything is possible.  I did
mine myself using junkyard/used parts and it cost me around $400.  He had
his professionally installed and I was scared to ask what it cost him but
I'm guessing easily $1500+.  So depending on how much work you want to do,
it would either be expensive or outrageously expensive to put A/C into your
bus, but certainly not impossible.
