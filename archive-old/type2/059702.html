Subject: Re:009 vs Vac (was dizzy on a FI bus)

Just as an aside - when i first got my bus and knew nothing, a friend said &quot;hey man, pull that old dizzy and pop a 009 in there!&quot;  I destroyed my old dist getting out(don't ask). Later, i priced the correct distributor for my model in the Jbugs catalog and they want $316.00 for it!!!
Hard lesson.
-c.gordon

&gt;He went on to say that he went to some kind of &gt;demonstration
&gt; of a &quot;high performance&quot; Vw engined vehicle (?) &gt;that actually charged more
&gt; for the &quot;upgrade&quot; to the 009 to replace the &gt;stock vacuum advance. Whoa!!!
