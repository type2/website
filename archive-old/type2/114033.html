Subject: Re: [T2] chris mills   what was the stuff ?

&gt;hi Chris.. I hope you are the guy... someone on the list used some &quot;stuff&quot;
to
&gt;fix a stripped out bolt.  I wonder if it would work for me?  I have a
stripped
&gt;temp sensor 78 westy.

Form-A-Thread. #28654

Stripped Thread Repair Kit permanently repairs stripped threads and
fasteners in five minutes (up to SAE Grade 5 English and 8.8 metric).
Allows up to 128 lb. torque and 3000F. Resists most shop fluids.

Hope this works for you. Understand that the sensor you are trying to
repair needs good electrical contact to the head and this MAY insulate it
rendering it useless. HOWEVER you might be just fine with a jumper wire of
some sort.

Good luck.
