Subject: fuzz up my tailpipe

driving around the neighborhoods today i got pulled over by a cycle cop.
what a maroon. he said my license plate holders were illegal (one and
old-style metal, the other from the blood bank); that they partially
covered the month which my registration expires - and seemingly wanting to
talk vdubs while poking around. he sez what year is that, dint know vw made
a club cab. still have the 40horse? vw fan, or whuh.
