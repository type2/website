Subject: Re: [T2] When Bus Owners Strike Back (window Installation)

Hey Jules
 
     The glass went out this morning, all you should  have to do is remove 
the 10mm bolt that holds the vent frame next to the winder  and the screw at the 
top, and remove the channel felt. after this you should be  able to slide the 
glass from the top and let it slide to the bottom of the door  then put the 
vent frame back and the felt. 
 
I removed it in the dork last night in about 15 min so its not to hard to  
reinstall.
