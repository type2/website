I've already got my down comforter in my 80 Westy for
next year (darn near froze this time).  The group
camping area idea of Emmet and Bob sounds great, and
should simplify the reservation situation allowing
some to join or drop out at the last minute.

P.S.  For Assateague Island history lovers:

Pirates - Charles Wilson frequented Assateague Island.
 He was a former South Carolina sea captain who turned
pirate, and was hung in London for piracy.  A letter
he wrote to his brother surfaced in Germany around
1940.  Charles described  the location of 10 chests of
silver bars, gold, jewels, and diamonds he buried on
Assateague.  He buried them on a bluff overlooking the
Atlantic at the head of a creek north of an inlet
above Chincoteague Island.  The brother died penniless
in this country.  Obviously the treasure is still on
Assateague.

Developers - Assateague almost became Ocean Beach in
the 60s.  A brocure for Ocean Beach which had 9000
housing lots planned described it in glowing terms. 
&quot;Ocean Beach is within three hours easy motoring
distance of Washington and Baltimore, the same
distance from Wilmington and Philadelphia, and
approximately the same distance from such Pennsylvania
communities as Reading, Lancaster, Bethlehem, Chester,
and Norristown.  Indeed, one can now motor comfortably
from New York City and Northern New Jersey's large
population areas to Ocean Beach...Several recently
completed super-highways now make Ocean Beach easier
to reach by a greater number of vacationers than any
other ocean front property along the entire Atlantic
seabord....Here at Ocean Beach, you have all the
sports which the combination of ocean and bay offers
for your unceasing pleasure on the Atlantic Ocean&quot;

Of the planned 9000 homes, a few hundred were
constructed in 1962 when a Nor'-Easter stalled off the
coast of Assateague pumping millions of gallons of
water back and forth across the island,  All but a few
houses were destroyed.  Land values plummeted, nad the
National Park Service was able to buy the island
cheaply.

You can see remnants of this development on the Life
of the Dunes Trail.  Here yard thick asphalt pieces of
Ocean Beach's main drag (Baltimore Avenue) lie twisted
and heaved by Assateague's storms.  If you take a
ranger led hike of this trail, most rangers will
become misty eyed as they describe how Assateague was
saved from becoming Ocean Beach.  Hooray for
Nor'-Easters!
