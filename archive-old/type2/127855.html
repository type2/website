this is one of those times on a pancake engine where it's easy to not
pull the engine to fix it :)

yes. remove the fan belt. Remove the pully fan and then just pull the
seal and replace it. Do however make sure you have the correct seal
(lots of flaps will get the rear &amp; front seal mixed) I'd buy one of
each just to be sure.
