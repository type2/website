Subject: Re: [T2] winterizing a bus :)

Hi all,

this is what I do:

    -fill gas tank and treat with stabilizer, run engine for 5 min or so to
get the treated gas through the system.
    -let cool, stuff rags in tail pipe(s).
    -disconnect or remove battery .
    -remove spark plugs and spray WD-40 or equivalent down hole.
    -turn the engine by hand at least one full turn once every two weeks or
sooner.
    -push the vehicle forward and backwards a bit so not to get flat spots
on tires.
