Subject: Splittie Steering Wheel Lock

HI All,

I was wondering if anyone could tell me more about how  the 
steering wheel lock on a splitty works. I found a sterring 
wheel lock on  a bus in the wreckers but don't want to go to 
 all the hassle to remove the entire steering column.

Is it possible to simply hack the sterring lock mechanism 
out of there (the idea of a hacksaw blade comes to mind :) 
and retrofit it on the steering column on my bus.

The prospect of dealing with rusted on steering column bolts 
doesn't sound too appealing.

m.
