&gt; Load range C does not mean squat.

&gt; [I wish I had a picture of a set of 4 LT tires that were Load range D. Those may-pops had a max weight rating
&gt; of 1311 lbs.!!!! They were at the Bakersfield show in the spring]
&gt;
&gt; What is the max load weight marked on the side?
&gt;
&gt; I just looked at a 78 Westy that had brand new Kirkland load range C tires on it and the max weight rating was
&gt; LESS than Michelin passenger car tires!  Michelin 185R14 are 1450 lbs. Michelin 185R14 reinforced are 1540
&gt; lbs. which is the minimum weight rating for a Westy. The Kirkland's were 1435 lbs.!

and from the other side of the barn my 205/70R14 Michelin bus tires have a
load range of C but are rated at 1993lbs (or thereabouts) and have 99S
rating....far more than enough and handle very well, (at about $500 for 4
they better, but)
