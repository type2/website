Subject: Re: [T2] A painting accident that turned out good...

I have an electrostaic set up for paintingheavey equipment--no over
spray--it all goes to the machine, and the total amount of material lost
into the air is minimal.
However--all you can push through the electrostaic is sythetic
enamel--and that's it.
Tractor enamel is right, and nothing more--

No laquer thinner, no hardner, just zylene, Tolene, or mineral sprits
for reducer--

You would get a fast coverage paint job but no longevity with the
synthetic enamel.
It chaulks out and fades in about 6 months in the sun--

Later,

Terry

The best one I heard here on the list last year- rent an electrostatic
paint gun, and use tractor paint. Little skill required and less paint
needed to cover, so they say. Just like paint electroplating... Tom

John, 
Sounds great! So what effect is the reducer supposed to have on the
paint and what &quot;bad&quot; will happen because you left it out! 
One of the few things on cars I have not done.....paint...but it is
starting to sound more interesting! I would risk it on my daily driver
bug just to see what it looks like... 
And what brand paint for only $75/gallon?? 
Cheers, dave&gt;
