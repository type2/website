Subject: RE: [T2] another emissions question

&gt; I went through inspection with a friend and his single cab(they
&gt; check safety not emissions). The inspector looks
&gt; underneath and while knocking on the heater box says,&quot; cool, duel
&gt; cat converters&quot;.



I once had my bus state-inspected at an NTB (tire/battery chain owned by
Sears).  The inspector put the wand up the tailpipe of my gas heater to test
emissions.   It passed with flying colors. :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I never took my bus through the CT inspection because it's
&gt; over 25 years old.  As I recall, the dyno test takes less than
&gt; one minute.  I doubt that your engine would overheat in that
&gt; amount of time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; CT and MD sound pretty close to identical, the
&gt; machines/operators give you
&gt; &gt; an automatic second chance if you fail right away...I timed the car in
&gt; &gt; front of me and he  was in there on the rollers for over 5 minutes and
&gt; &gt; varying RPM.
