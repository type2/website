&gt; I nearly &quot;bought it&quot; one dark night on a freeway 'cuz a wire broke loose.
&gt; It scared me pretty badly.
&gt; 
&gt; Very next day...
&gt; I broke loose all connectors and soldered.
&gt; I routed the wires STRAIGHT out their spade connectors for a short 
&gt; distance before allowing any bending of the wire as it completes it 
&gt; circuit journey to wherever.
&gt; 
&gt; The wires are now free to vibrate without breaking, and now the spade 
&gt; connector will not come loose from the wire by eating off wire strands.

A short lenghth of heat-shrink tubing over the terminal and extending an
inch or so up the wire is also a good idea, as it will support the wire
against vibration.  I use 1/4 inch heat shrink tubing which will pass
over the terminal, so this is a retrofit possibility.

Factory-crimp terminals don't need soldering, as they are incredibly
secure as is.  I can't even get solder to flow into the crimped area!  
They still get the heat-shrink treatment. Hand-crimping
tools cannot produce the quality of the factory crimp (unless you spend
$$$ for a crimper), so you have to solder to get a reliable connection

The &quot;insulated&quot; crimp-on terminals from the FLAPS are a joke.  If I have
to use these, I pull the
insulating sleeve off and toss it.  Better terminals are available from
electronic suppliers.  These come uninsulated and are made of stronger
materials.  Buy a hundred of these and you'll not run out again for a
while!

Scotch-Lock connectors are the tools of the devil, cutting wire strands
and promoting corrosion.  Leave these to the quickie-stereo-install folks
and don't let them near your vehicle!
