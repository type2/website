Subject: Re: [T2] Adding and Converting AC Systems


&gt; Anyone see the three part series on adding AC in VW
&gt; Trends?  The third part looked pretty informative and
&gt; mentioned the lower power demands of Sanden
&gt; compressors over the old York.  Are there standard
&gt; brackets for adapting Sanden to mount like a York?  I
&gt; think the Sanden 508 was supposed to be a good unit,
&gt; anyone know if they are used as oe on any vehicles?


I know the Bus Depot sells a kit for this...I have not seen it, though.


&gt; 
&gt; I only saw part 3 of the AC series.  Anyone read the
&gt; other 2?  They probably talked about where to mount
&gt; condensers and evaporators, and maybe where to get
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm thinking about converting my 80 Westy AC to R134.
&gt; I'm guessing I need to change to barrier hoses, and
&gt; probably switch accumulators and go with a Sanden
&gt; compressors.  Anyone ever switch theirs to R134?
&gt;
