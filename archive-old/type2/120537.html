Subject: dual H32 34pdsi-2/3 carbs for a 1600dp bus. Questions

Hello List,

I have been searching the archives for this and have
only found 2 posts on the subject. I am looking at
putting a factory new 1600cc DP engine in my 68 bus. I
already have a source for a complete, siezed,
(supposly) 71 dual port engine to steal parts from. I
am interested in putting a set of dual carbs on this
bus and I found a set for a reasonable price. They are
exactly like this set except with different air
cleaners. What do you think?

I am told they are a simplier version of the ones used
on the 72 bus. They were supposily origional equipment
on type 3 in europe (I think). They are jetted for a
1600 DP directly out of the box. Has anyone had
experience with these? The linkage is obviously
different from the stock 72 linkage as shown in the
picture. Any thoughts? Would the stock 68 fuel pump be
able to handle these carbs?

Regards,

David Kelly
