Subject: STEERING SWING ARM BRACKET ON FRONT BEAM
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

hi volks. oh dear oh dear. im trying to leave to go to jerome on sunday (why
so early? im in miami, fl).

anyway the point of my correspondence. you dudes need to look at the front
beam where the steering swing arm is welded to it. looked at mine, found a
crack. looked closer (wire brush etc) and its cracked from one side to the
other. in time it would have snapped off and i would have had no steering. 
has anyone else come across this? its a 72 westy.

marty :)
