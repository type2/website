Subject: Re: neighbors suck/WT car circus

Let's see, I have 2 Subaru EA-81 Wagons, non ops, 1 Subaru EA-82 Non op, I
Subaru Brat, non op, 2 Subaru BRATS that run, 1 fer parts, 1 Subaru EA-81
Hatch, 2 Subaru 360 Vans, 2 Subaru 360 Trucks, 1 78 VW Bus (EA-81 water
Candidate), 1 Ford Escape, and 1 Ford F250.  I am right at 30 y.o. too.  It
helps that I live at the sh*t end of a dirt road on my own 45 acres and I
have a basement too.  Can't see the neighbours, so they don't bother me.
Junk cars are down my Farm road and hidden behind the Barn.

It sounds like all of you who have a car hobby that entails keeping beaters
or parts cars around needs to move out in the country.  I live 8 miles from
town, 20 from work, 14 to Wal-Mart, 40 miles to Roanoke (Sam's Club, Brest
Buy, et al).  Land can be had cheaply if one doent mind a dirt road.  My
solution to my car hobby.

Oh Yeah, we have restrictive zoning in my county too (must be all those
academics at Va Tech)

--------------------------------- 
&gt; Yes pholks,
&gt;
&gt; for those of you who don't know, having buttloads of beaters in the yard
is not cool to the neighbors who have to share an eyesore with you as they
come home everyday.
&gt;
&gt; the problem with america (here I go) is that everyone's so busy screaming
about what they're own rights are that we've forgotten that your rights end
where your neighbor's begin.
&gt;
&gt; I won't even get into the lost art of common courtesy.
&gt;
&gt; I must be getting close to 30,
