Subject: Re: [T2] Sound deadening...

 Careful with the sound deadening/insulation...IIRC, there was a long photo 
&gt; and text story of a bus that was &quot;treated&quot; in this way and ended up rusting 
&gt; severely 'cuz the materials were &quot;holding water&quot; as Tom Waits would say... 
&gt; ;-( 
&gt; Anybody remember the site for the &quot;treated&quot; bus... ?-( 
&gt; 

I have seen this before, it was not treated in any way that I would be doing it or that any expert would suggest, it was filled with things that would hold water, not dynamat and bubblewrap, I think that this example has nothing to do with sound deadening and everything to do with not having any common sense.

In my case I only have dynamat against the metal, the cloth tape I use goes between the mat and the bubblewrap.

The spray in foam I am suggesting would be under my seat, not in my doors where water can get on it regularly.

Just don't fill your bus with a bunch of sponges, use materials that make sense.
