Does anyone know whee I can get a set of &quot;Air Non-Return Flaps and Pins&quot; for 
a '76 type IV.  This is what the Bentley manual ('68-'79) calls them on page 
5-21 in Fig 7-3 Item 24.  They are the little metal flaps which keep the 
Heater blower air from blowing back into the fan housing at low RPM's.  Mine 
are gone and I can't find any at local wrecking yards (or they want me to 
buy the entire fan housing).
