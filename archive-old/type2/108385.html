Subject: RE: [T2] Valves

Probably the autolinea castings, sold  by AVP...
I had bad luck with them on a particular evil motor 2 years ago.


...
&gt; &gt; I just purchased a set of AVP heads a few months
&gt; ago (June).

I know nothing about AVP heads, never heard of them,
but i would say they should stand behind their
product, seeing how in my opinion it appears a defect.

it sounds to me your valve is way out of seat and is
hammering your head, i would contact this AVP
immediately and have them send a new head (free) or
refund your money..

Please keep us posted as to what they say, if they
stand by their product then I would recommend them
(everyone makes mistakes), but if they try to screw
you let us know, in that instance i personally will
NEVER use them..
