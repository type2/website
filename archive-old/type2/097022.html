Subject: Re: [T2] STARTER

I can't seem to get the solenoid off of my old starter to check for sure, so
I'm making this up as I go along....

If you look in the hole where the solenoid goes you should have access to a
metal post or some other metal part which is insulated from the starter
case.  This would be the positive terminal for the starter motor.  Using fat
wires, if you connect a 12v battery to the ground strap on the starter case
and the the aforementioned positive terminal, the motor should spin.  Be
careful not to short the battery out.

In fact, you can probably safely skip this step and just replace the
solenoid.  Your symptoms are classic solenoid, as I experienced on two
coast-to-coast trips.
