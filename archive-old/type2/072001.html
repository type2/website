Subject: Re: Pop-Top hold-down improvements?! Ideas???

&gt;The one thing that bothers me the *most* when I travel
&gt;is the way the Pop-Top jumps, rumbles, clangs and
&gt;vibrates every time a semi passes or I get caught in
&gt;strong wind! I have this continuing fear that it will
&gt;open on me when I'm travelling a 60mph!

&gt;Any other ideas?


Here is what I did two years ago.

Buy a 4ft strip of flexible magnet at a hobby store.  This is usually about
3/8 inch wide &amp; black plastic type stuff.
Buy some neoprene pick-up truck cap sealer tape in a similar width and as
tall as possible, at least 1/2 inch.
Put the seal tape on the magnetic strip and trim the whole thing to fit
across the front edge of the roof above the windsheild against the edge of
the poptop.  It will act like a spoiler and deflect the air over the top
instead of it creeping under.

The poptop has not popped on the highway since I did this, and the bus is
less drafty in the winter too.
