Subject: strange front seat in Westy

Hello All,
  While going through a salvage yard near my house I was
looking at all the Busses and saw something interesting
that I just had to have. I found a front seat set-up in a
Westy that was a split bench. Its a 70-30 style but the
strange thing is that the bus is a walk-through. Instead of
having the full panel like a non-walk-through it was split.
To support the full width seat there are speical brackets
to hold up the seat and connect the two sides at the top of
the seat walls. The connector at the top has a pad with the
same shape, it bolts up to stock holes. The connectors at
the bottom, under the seat, look like factory also. They
use stock seat bolts and the seat is just like a
non-walk-through seat. Has anyone ever seen one of these
before. I will pick it up some time this week and find out
if there are any VW marks on it. I am in Wa. so it could be
a Canada Westy convertion maybe? The Bus it is in is a real
Westy not a home brew.
  Also, if anyone needs anything, let me know. There are 6
68-79 Busses in this yard, 5 in one 1/4 mile down the
street, and 2 or three in another yard close by. I also
know of about 8 more in yards in this area. None of these
are splities, just Baywindows. I also know of about 4
sitting in fields.
  BTW I have been through the Library many times and never
once saw anything about a seat like this. I have never seen
one in a members Bus or in a salvage yard. I've never seen
one at a show. When I get it home I will take some pictures
of it and post them somewhere for veiwing. Thanks.
