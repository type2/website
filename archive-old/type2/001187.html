So I call today and find nothing was shipped!  They are waiting on a couple
parts to come in. I wont make the VW show in 2 days for lack of an
exhaust/heater boxes.

Seems to me that the biggest problem in not making it to the show was your
late ordering of vital parts. Even if the Bus Depot is to blame for not
shipping when they promised to do so. When working on 20+ years old cars you
cannot rely on immediate availability when you need parts. This is something
you just have to take into account.

Remember the old saying: A lack of planning on your side does not constitute
an emergency on my (fill in however you need) side.
