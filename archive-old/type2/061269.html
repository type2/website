Subject: Upright or Pancake?

Thanks for clearing up what is what, I guessed this was the
difference, but didn't want to get confused by
an &quot;Americanism&quot;.

So theoreticaly if I had a 1600 dual port upright stock &amp; a 1600 (do
they do this size?) pancake, which is the better based on reliability,
accessabitity, longevity &amp; any other &quot;ity&quot; or power (BHP)?

This should put the cat amongst the birds, so please don't answer me
direct, i'll catch it in the digest or else my yahoo account will fill
up!

ttfn
