Jeff, AFAIK you only legally have to have seatbelts if they were there when
the vehicle was originally registered. (Take that with a grain of salt
though since I'm in Australia) As for the beeries in the back.... well... if
you duck down while you drink em, and no one throws one at the driver......
I've got the same thing as you... mine didn't originally have a seat in the
back, it's registered to carry 2 in front... So, theoretically I don't have
to have seatbelts in the back.. I guess you could also take that as I'm not
supposed to have that bench seat in the back then either... oops..
I'm still sorting seat belts out though. Think after this next lot of work
my bank account is going to be back to zilch.... It'll be interesting to
find out the differences in countries though.

I know this question was asked a long time ago but I can't remember what the
final answer was. I wondering about the legalities of driving with
passengers in the back of my Riveria. There are no seat belts in the back on
the bench seats by the table, but I didn't really think this mattered
because I thought the camper was considered an RV. Also if it is classified
as an RV does that mean that passengers in the back (as far away from the
driver as possible)are allowed to drink beer while on the road? I live in
Canada so things might be different up here in the great white north but I
just thought I would check things out before I depart for the weekend.

cheers...
