Subject: Have to sell my Westy

Guys,
 
     Sorry I have to do this but I need the cash.   I have a MINT 76 Westy 
with 56K original miles (affadavit from owner).  I  have spent 2 years restoring 
her to cherry.  She is 90% completed and all  that is left is to install 
camper components(from behind the front seat to rear  hatch).  All parts come with 
the van, OEM and brand new.  SERIOUS  INQUIRIES ONLY. 386-689-8407

Tom Rebman
