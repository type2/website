Hey Christopher,

Have you checked into shipping it out there.  My dad had a car shipped 
from Florida to Washington State last year.  I don't remember the price 
but I remember being surprised that it was lower that I expected.

I can check to see what the company was if you like.

&gt;I need to either
&gt;A. sell it again in the next few weeks, which I am trying, but I don't
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;B. get another motor installed so I can drive it back (after driving
&gt;there once, then flying back to drive this out as well, or vise versa)
