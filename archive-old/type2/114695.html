Subject: Re: [T2] Painting The Pop Top

My top was grey, dingy and had fibers showing on the sides. I used a 
bleach-based soft scrub kitchen product and a Black &amp; Decker Scumbuster 
with a 3M type scouring pad. This cleaned the top nicely and removed 
the loose fibers. I should say displaced the fibers, the great majority 
of which ended up embedded in my skin. I itched for weeks afterwards. 
When I die I'm considering donating my body to a surf shop.

I sealed the top with Star Brite Glass Cote, a urethane product that I 
got at West Marine. $20, applies with a lint-free cloth and supposedly 
can be easily removed if needed. This last point is what sold me--I 
figured I could try it and if I didn't like it I could still paint. But 
if I started to paint and didn't like it...well too bad, eh?

The result with Star Brite was great--nice white and shiny.  Not quite 
perfect but purty darn close.

&gt; Hello,
&gt;     I'm sorry for the second question.  My pop top is
&gt; looking kind of dirty.  I've tried scrbbing with no
&gt; luck-it's deep inside the fiberglass.
