Subject: [T2] heater cables...continued (w/tips)

This weekend I posted problems with my new heater cables.  I was unsure as 
to how easy they should move, since the ones in my bus were frozen...hence 
I had nothing to go by.

As I was disconnecting everything under the vehicle my boyfriend (and handy 
sidekick) was laying out the new cables.  Little did I know, the new cables 
did NOT easily move when fresh out of the package.  Basically, we installed 
and removed these new cables three times...

I now realize that the new cables probably sat on a shelf for 
awhile...making it more difficult to move them.  The UPS guy could have 
smashed the box...and so on.  Basically there are many possibilities for my 
weekend woes.  So, after my 3 day adventure of attempting to bring warm 
goodness in my bus...I have a few tips:

1) Check the cables before going through the hassle of installing them.  If 
you believe they will never move, return them.

2) If they move but not that easily (and don't want to return them 
because...you're stubborn like me) they can be lubricated.  Take a ziplock 
bag and poke a small hole into the bottom of it.  Gently push the cable 
through the hole and pull the bag past the cable/sheath entry.  Then pull 
the bag almost to that entry.  Essentially, you are making a cup around the 
cable.  Use some electrical tape to make a snug fit.  Then get a can of 
Silicone Lube.  Use the long plastic tip and squirt a ton of this stuff 
into the bag.  Close the ziplock bag.  (I used Silicone, because it tends 
to not collect dirt and it won't freeze.)

This is where science is cool.  The pressure in the bag created from the 
spray pushes the silicone down the cable.  (You can see it 
bubbling.)  Also, the propellant tends to make the cable VERY cold, so you 
can feel down the cable to see how far the lube has actually gone.

We did this on both ends of the cable and now it move smooth like butter!

3) We carefully straightened the cable by tying one end with bailing wire 
to the garage door, while the other gently pulled on it.  (Mine had a few 
twists in it from the packaging.)

So, if you are trying to get your old ones working again, or trying to 
install new &quot;tough&quot; ones.  This method takes time, but works well.  I don't 
think a store/distributor would take cables &quot;soaked&quot; in lube back, so make 
the &quot;to return or not to return&quot; decision early.  Mine had already been 
lubed on the outside with grease to get them in the bus, so I had nothing 
to lose.

Now, I only hope that heat will be plentiful!
