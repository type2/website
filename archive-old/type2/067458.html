&gt;&gt; I heard on the radio that L.A. pollution levels were way down, that this

&gt;I wouldn't believe anything I heard 'on the radio'. LA pollution
&gt;levels have been visibly increasing for the five yrs I lived
&gt;there (90-95). They always have said that. Of course it was attri-
&gt;buted to their oxy gas. Wonder what it's doing to our mileage and
&gt;engines.

&gt;If they cared about the air in LA, they'd have built mass transit
&gt;a long time ago, rather than tearing the existing mass transit
&gt;system up.

The latest thing Cal-  A Subway that's costing BILLIONS and BILLIONS
(thanks, Carl Sagan), being built in Earthquake Country.  Smart, eh ?
Somebody's really lining their pockets on THIS one.  Hollywood Blvd
is sinking because of it.  And now they are using explosives under
the Hollywood frwy thru Cahuenga pass.

I remember, old fart that I am, a really nifty transportation of the
&quot;future&quot; that showed up in 1955.  The monorail at Disneyland.
THAT's what LA needs.
