&gt; I've been reading my Bentley and I can't seem to understand why my fuel pump would come on with the engine off and key removed.(1979 - 2.0 liter,automatic). I had just moved it and shut it off and happend to be standing behind it when I heard the pump start.
&gt;  This Bus had been sitting for about 6 -8 years. I've replaced the fuel lines ect. flushed the tank- too many filters too remember.

check the insulation on the pump, the pump is insulated from the body via
the mounting brackets, you could be getting a stray ground through the
mount
