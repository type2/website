&lt;&lt; The splits seem to go to bus
events, but the bays go everywhere! &gt;&gt;

Might have to do with rising values...Same thing happens to most 
&quot;orphan&quot; cars. While in production, cars depreciate according to
age, but once production stops, value plummets as the car be-
comes harder to &quot;readily&quot; service - ie, the corner FLAPS stops
restocking in favor of cars that are in production.
       After a few years, some cars start to rise in value - Cars
that were desirable (looks? performance?) when in production
return faster than others. Eventually, if it gets old enough, al-
most anything gets &quot;antiquey&quot; enough to be valuable - Old Fal-
cons? Valiants? Larks? Etc.
       Splits have reached a certain level of &quot;cachet&quot; to be &quot;col-
lectable&quot; and &quot;collectable&quot; cars rely on originality to define val-
ue...And, restoring one to that level is expensive (as is restor-
ing any car), such that it becomes prohibitive to actually drive
an investment and risk losing value in an accident or just wear
and tear.
       Bays, are still being driven and, although the values are
rising, the parts are still cheap enough to make them viable
everyday drivers.
       Guys old enough to remember British sports cars being
on the road will recognize this scenario...Priced a rust bucket
MG or Triumph...Not just the &quot;T&quot; series MG, but all the way
down to &quot;restorable&quot; Midgets and Spitfires?
