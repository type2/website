Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

&gt;Yes, I'm shouting. Also, check the rubber parts of &gt;the EGR system. Reach up into the air intakes and &gt;follow the metal lines towards the front of the bus.

Heyup! Just for newbie's sakes, That's not EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) that's the fuel tank venting system. The gas fumes being vented to the air intakes from the gas tank have neither become exhaust nor have they been recirculated.

However, do check the rubber connectors of this venting system as mentioned.
