Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing just the electrical part of late bay
  ignition switch

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;courtney hook&quot;

&gt;  Has anyone done this replacement WITHOUT removing the whole column as
advised by this article? The article in the tech writeup section makes it
look rather daunting.
&gt;

I just happen to have opened this can of worms,,, I have a column in front
of me...out of the bus.

I guess if you were stuck ,, you could butcher the old switch out with a
long drill bit,, your not going to get that grub screw out as it goes in on
an angle that is blocked by the column down tube.  But the plastic switch
body could be chewed out...   Then you would have to trim off the mounting
screw on the new switch.. and then try to rig up a holding mechanism,, to
replace the grub screw method .... really,,, not a idea that I would
entertain.  It would be easier to put a push buttons on the dash to by pass
the key switch,, and just use the key as a steering lock mechanism.

Taking the column apart isn't that tough... just time consuming..

I can tell you,, that &quot;grub&quot; screw is behind the steel tube of the column,,
and your not getting the switch out unless you want to destroy parts
