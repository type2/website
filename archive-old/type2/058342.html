Well something is getting lost in translation.  US destination models in '73
would indeed have featured a Type IV (4) engine.  The T4 is drastically
heavier, looks quite a bit different, has a horizontally mounted oil cooler,
rear fan similar to T3 but a spin on filter mount.  It is twice the weight
of a T1, T3 engine and the most distinguishing thing I can think of is the
oil filter mount.  However the only C coded T4 engines seem to be CB, CD
('72-'73 1700's) or CV (Vanagon 2000 case) origional supply, perhaps yours
is a factory replacement case.  A good T4 characteristic as well, the heads
will usually feature 4 intake mounting studs around the dual ports (or
rarely 3 if it came from a VW/Porsche 2.0 liter) but definitely not 2 like a
dual port bug head.  The T4 will not easily fit into a bay window bus made
to have a T1 engine just as the reverse is also true.  The way you
hypothesize is likely easier as you probably need cooling sheet metal and
bearer bar from a US model pretty easy to find, to go T1 into T4 hole we
need the tin and bearer bar you have which are EXCEPTIONALLY rare in the US.
No real reason to do it anyway, although stock the T4 is more bang for the
buck, you can quickly build a hi-po T1 cheaper than a stock or modified T4.
Hope this helps.

John
