&gt;&gt; Also, in the latest VWM mag from the UK they show a *new* Devon camper
&gt;&gt; Uses a *new* &quot;1973ish&quot; Mexican bus......(Link-pin front end..with disc
&gt;&gt; brakes!?!?)
&gt;&gt; Like, you can still *buy* a new bus...
&gt;&gt; Who had the vin plates for sale??
&gt;&gt; (only kidding, *I'd* get caught, sure as sunshine)

&gt;Steve:
&gt;They are probably Mexi-buses- basically 73-79 style with an 1800 Golf
&gt;water-cooled motor vertially mounted in back, and a Darth Vader-style
&gt;nose for the radiator. They perform well and are often seen in the
&gt;American southwest. VW de Mexico shows them on its website. $18-19,000,
&gt;not cheap enough to warrant interest in doing a &quot;jack up the VIN plate,
&gt;change the whole car routine&quot; like Beetlemex does with mexi-beetles.
&gt;Believe me, I'd consider using a chassis from one under my 69 double cab
&gt;if I could get one into Iowa legally. (I have often referred to my 69
&gt;double cab as &quot;the rustiest one still going to work every day&quot;. It's so
&gt;rusty underneath that the partition behind the front seats twangs
&gt;(oil-cans) driving over irregular surfaces.

Hi Steve and Al,

Those Buses offerd in the englisch VWM Magazines are actual Brasilian
models.
They are indeed aircooled with Type 1 engines, &quot;later&quot; front axles and the
mexican-styled roofs.
The old brazilian buses with the samba styled windows (including rear corner
windows) are out of production since
about 2 years now.
As far as I know are the original brazilian engines changed against mexican
beetle engines with catalyst to meet
british registration laws, that declares their very high prices.
Is any british member on this list to confirm?
BTW: What do you mean with &quot;sure as the sunshine&quot;? It's been raining all day
long....
