Subject: Re: Poptop cleaning suggestions

A few years ago a switched to a sportsmobile top. 
Before I switched, I had to clean the new top. This
top had been sitting, in a wooded area, on the ground.
Moss, algae, dirt, the whole gammut. 
I started with VIM (&quot;with bleach&quot;) on an electric
orbital &quot;polisher&quot;. The vim was good at smoothing out
the roughness caused by years of neglect, but it
wouldn't touch the black.
Once the roof was smooth (polishing with vim is like
polishing with a very light compound) I used a
bleach/water solution, and it brought the roof to
white instantly. 
Granted, it's possible any clothing you're wearing
will end up white as well.
I've done a couple of roofs using bleach/water, and
they've come up white. 
Never tried Mr.Clean though, I think I'll try that
this summer. 

Good luck, 
Adam

Planning this weekend to clean my pop top on my westy.
It's been years
and I have the prerequisite algae growing on it, etc.
I'd love some
suggestions as to what works well to clean the
fiberglass.

Thanks
