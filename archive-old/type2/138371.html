&lt;&lt;Not the problems of the Porsche engine.&gt;&gt;

Some folks have indeed transplanted Porsche 356, 911 and 912 engines into 
buses, but they are rare and were NEVER stock!  Not something you need to worry 
much about; it will be fairly evident if the bus has either the 356 or 911 
engine based on the price the PO is going to be trying to get out of the bus.

If a 914 engine has been transplanted you will want to determine if they kept 
the bus stock L-jet fuel injection or transferred the 914's D-jet.  Other 
than that, the 914's engine is very similar to a bus engine and the conversion 
shoulsn't cause any problems.
