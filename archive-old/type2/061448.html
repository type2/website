Subject: Crew Cab For Sale (not trade!) -- Virginia

Hi Volks.....about a month back I posted that I'd be interested in
swapping my very nice 71 crew cab for a very nice late bay westy.  As it
turns out, I bought a nice '79 westy so I'm selling Cosmo outright.

Here are the particulars:

-Nicely restored two years ago (i.e., rust cut out...new metal put
in......)
-excellent paint job (blue with white bumbers).
-Light grey interior
-red oak wood slats on truck bed
-6,000 miles on rebuilt engine
-comes with original hoops and canvas (actually a heavy rubber/vinyl
material)
-$7,000 (yes....it's that nice)
Located in Northern Virginia

&quot;Holiday Parties&quot; link and then choose the 1997 party pictures.)

Bob

p.s. I apologize to those who previously sent notes indicating that
you'd be interested in an outright buy.....I'd have contacted you first
but I didn't keep your email addresses
