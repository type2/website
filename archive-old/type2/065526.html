Subject: Re: spring loaded pushtubes for 67 westy?

 It appears that I have a couple of push tubes leaking, and it is getting
worse, where can I find the spring loaded type? If I use this type, can they
be installed without removing or loosening the heads?

Are the tubes cracked?  or is it leaking from the seals?

The two part push rod tubes can be installed w/o removing the engine or
heads.

pop the valve cover off, remove th rocker arms, and pull out the appropriate
push rod (s).   remove the old PRT with a pair of pliers (this destroys it)
 Put new seals on the two part tube, install it and turn the nuts to tighten
it against the head and case.   Lock the nuts togerther by tightening them
against each other.  Put the rest back togerther.   

I did this on my 65 camper recently as it had a damaged PRT.  I had some
lying around the garage, inquire at your local VW shop for a source.

I don't know if this is what you mean.  Mine aren't &quot;spring loaded&quot; but they
do the job.
