Subject: Re: [T2] oring sealer

I'm not sure if I'll just use a simple lube on the next set of tube rings.
The last engine I installed new rings in, as I have always done, I used some
wheel bearing grease on the 3/4 side of the engine, but used some aviation
permatex on the 1/2 side.

After 25,000 miles, the grease only side is slightly oily while the permatex
side is BONE dry.  I know the tubes will be a bit harder to get back out,
but I have built a puller that expands on the inside and pulls them that
way, so I don't think it will be a problem.

I think on the next engine, I think I will be using a light coating of
sealer.

&gt;&gt; A friend of mine recommends Dow Corning 111 Valve Lubricant and Sealant for
&gt;&gt; the Viton push rod tube seals.  Has anyone used it?
&gt; 
&gt; This is a little off the deep end for push rod tube
&gt; seal installation. Kind of like where the discussions
&gt; go for Porsche - you only need a simple lubricant to
&gt; install these seals, like a drop of oil off your dipstick.
&gt; Otherwise, this expensive sealer is suitable for the task
&gt; at hand-it is a gooey silicone paste, also ok for food
&gt; preparation and suba gear. The next better sealer would be
&gt; Dow Corning 112 High Consistency Valve Sealant, it has
&gt; a higher temperature range ( 500F vs. 400F :)
&gt; These o-rings were not designed to require glue.
&gt; ( You stop one leak, it comes out somewhere else :).
