Subject: My Single Cab

Hey all, 

I think this would be an appropriate Friday post, a little update on my 
single cab. It is running well. I've put 4500 Km on the new 1776, it
is still running on 36 Dellorto's, there are two NOS Porsche 356 
Solexes waiting, the Berg manifolds for them arrived, a few small 
linkage problem and I can install them! I was running 4.5&quot;x15&quot; Fuchs 
alloys, with modern tires on them. The thing with the old Porsche alloys 
is that they can't be run without tubes, and the modern tires couldn't 
stand inner tubes, I had three flat tires in three months just because 
the inner tubes would wear trough. I located 4 16&quot; Boxster wheels 
and installed them with 205/55/16 Pirrelli P700's. The car's handling 
improved considerably. At work I found a pair of clean 911 Carrera 4
calipers, and installed those too, it was a gamble, they run on stock 
Bus disks, I tested with another caliper to see when the pistons would 
come out of the caliper (the Bus disks are considerably thinner than '
the Porsche disks they ran on originally) and I didn't know if the 
master cylinder would displace enough brake fluid so as to keep 
the pedal travel within limits. I had a local machine shop mill the 
mounting holes into an oval so I could mount them on the stock 
spindles, and they center perfectly over the stock disks, it was really 
simple, and now when I come up to a traffic light, I only have to put 
the weight of my leg on the pedal and it smoothly comes to a halt. 
the pedal travel is very minimal, it feels less than it was. 

Another thing is engine compartment sealing. It is a small experiment 
really. The small tins that sit around the intake manifold normally 
are not present in my car. I just left the small openings as they were, 
but am thinking of a way to seal them now. I currently have a stock 
muffler on it, I made the heater boxes and the muffler into one unit, 
to minimize the chance of leakage. I'm using the Berg 'space age' 
as they call they call them, exhaust gaskets, but I'm not impressed 
by their uhm.. quality or performance, I blew a few of them, I'm using 
new heads, stainless hardware (only on the exhaust) factory VW 
torque settings, and still they blow out, I was disappointed that this
happened with a Berg product. The thing is, the exhaust was leaking 
where the muffler flanges bolt to the head, and the interesting thing 
was that they left this carbon deposit in the engine compartment, 
showing the flow of the hot air under the engine shrouding mixed 
with exhaust gasses, for me this is positive evidence that 
amplifies the importance to really seal the engine compartment, 
it clearly shows that hot air from under the shrouding is drawn into 
the engine compartment even through smaller openings and in large 
enough amounts so that it would leave evidence. 

Another 'update' are Porsche instruments. I used nos Porsche 
instruments for a '76 911. I took a bare dash panel and flattened 
everything that is behind it to about 1cm, then you can fit a Porsche 
combi gauge which has a fuel gauge and an oil level gauge, the 
fuel gauge works just fine with the stock VW wiring and sender, 
and I wired the oil level gauge to a Porsche 924 oil pressure sender, 
it screws in place of the VW oil pressure switch. The speedo of 
the 911 and the clock fill the rest of the dash panel, they are just a 
press fit, and fit the Bus dash panel perfectly, the ratio of the speedo 
is correct, same as the Bus speedo. It looks factory.

Keep on Bussing, 

Brian
