Subject: Possum Returns

Greetings folks,
 
I am a returning listee who has been off list for a few months. Used to be in Arlington Va area, now working in Baltimore MD and living in Annapolis. Grew up sailing in Annapolis and am glad to have moved back. Some may recall reading about Possum my 78' Westy. Its pretty much stock with the exception of some vanagon seats up front and solid lifter web cam (mild grind) in the t-4 2.0 FI I rebuilt a few years ago. Shes been running great and now that my new house is built and I have a garage things will be getting done at a better rate. I am looking for a decent used thermostat as the original seems to be toast. Maybe I did not adjust the braket on it when I rebuilt and this let it expand to the point of cracking? No visible cracks just expanded and springy. Also got a small vacuum leak at the port side intake manifold. Got new gaskets and hope to get them in this weekend. I was seeing 13-14&quot; vacuum at idle and thought that a little low. Misted a little carb cleaner around (flame suit
 on here) and found the leak at the manifold. Anyway glad to be back, feel free to p-mail if you want to hook up in Anapolis sometime, I live in Hillsmere. I'm on digest mode so I may only be on the list a few times a day. I work in a bank now and the admins here are a bit stuffy...
 
Best Regards to All!
