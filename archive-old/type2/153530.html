Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus

Maybe we could go South of the Border, act very suspicious crossing back
with our new Bus, then claim Sanctuary status Mexi-bus in hand!

Just call me...

Jose Amez, immigrant

(with pardon to Jose Jimenez, Astronaut!)

A nieghbor of mine bought a sweet Mexican beetle off of an immigrant.  They
are allowed to bring one Mexican vehicle in with them and are exempt from
the regulations.  They can then turn around and sell that vehicle.  I
suppose if you found an immigrant that you could trust, you could send them
the money and have them buy the bus.  Then flip it to you when it gets here.
Maybe for a profit.   Only way I know of.  Cheers...KR
