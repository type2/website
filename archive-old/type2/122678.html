Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap buses (was CHEEP BUSES)

Whenever this topic comes up, we go through the same routine. Yes, it 
is possible to luck into a bus that costs way less than $1000, runs 
great for thousands of miles, never seems to need work or parts. Mike 
Benthin has a bus than has gone eight trillion miles on its original 
engine, or something like that.

You could also win the lottery, be discovered in a drug store and 
become a movie star, or get a call inviting you to replace Jerry Garcia 
in the next Dead tour. Probably not, though.

If you have responsibilities, and your bus is to be a tool for meeting 
your responsibilities, expect to spend about $4000 (give or take $1000) 
in purchase price, repairs, and general refurbishing before you have a 
safe and reliable vehicle.

The key fact that you must always keep in mind is that the Type 2 was 
not really designed for the way we drive in the United States. It 
wasn't intended to haul along at 70 mph -- or even 55 mph -- on 
freeways. It _was_ designed for short trips in town. So if you were to 
buy one today, you'd be getting a vehicle that has spent 25 to 35 years 
doing what it was never intended to do.

Transporters are amazing little critters, but they have limitations and 
it takes $ to overcome the limitations. Unless you are lucky.

To quote Clint Eastwood, &quot;Ask yourself: do you feel lucky today?&quot;
