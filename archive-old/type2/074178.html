Subject: Re: [T2] Single Cab Weight Distribution

On ya',Chad!
Too many people have obsessions with double cabs,
particularly here in Australia.
You don't know where I could get complete stats or
blue-prints for a 72 single cab?
Another friend over here is considering starting a
site like dropgates_dot_com for bay-windows.
I think they'll all be sorry in 10 or 20 years when
the supply of split window projects have dried up and
then all those resources about bays will be more
impossible to get than the stuff for splits.
:-)
Cheers

&gt; Well, I never got an answer on the weight
&gt; distribution specs, but I'm
&gt; happy to report all went well with the transport
&gt; today, so it must be
&gt; close to 50/50.  We put it on nose first and
&gt; centered it over the axles,
&gt; stopping just after the tongue began to drop under
&gt; the single cabs
&gt; weight.  Took about two hours to get the 71 loaded
&gt; and tied down on a 6'
&gt; x 16' tandem trailer (no winch, come alongs, and it
&gt; had four flat tires
&gt; and seized drums).
&gt; 
&gt; I figure the combined weight of the trailer and
&gt; single cab were about
&gt; 3700 pounds, but my '89 4Runner handled the load
&gt; without any problem.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a busy bus week, got rid of two buses and
&gt; acquired a fifth.
&gt; I'm eager to see what Chris has in store for the
&gt; Adventurewagen ( I've
&gt; heard some talk of a Vanagon Westy interior ?). 
&gt; Under the &quot;I will if
&gt; you will&quot; doctrine, I probably spring for an engine
&gt; rebuild at the same
&gt; time Chris gets one.  Now I've got until Everybus to
&gt; figure out what I'm
&gt; gonna sleep in.
