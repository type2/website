&gt; I just got back from my buddy's house where his new-to-him '73
&gt; Deluxe 7 passenger Bus was delivered today...
&gt; 
&gt; While cleaning out the junk and checking ID &amp; VIN#s we found some
&gt; inconsistencies that someone out there may be able to explain...
&gt; 
&gt; VIN# is 223, # stamped in engine compartment is 223, grey label on
&gt; driver's door jamb says DOM 09/73 (making this a '74 model year??).

I'd go by the VIN, but generally whatever is on the title goes.  If you
have the option, go for the older year on the paperwork.

&gt; Bus currently has an upright 1600 dp engine with correct euro cooling
&gt; tin (tin is stamped with VW part #, forgot to write it down).  Oil
&gt; pump
&gt; is fitted for a remote oil filter and fairly large oil cooler mounted
&gt; where a gas heater or second battery would mounted on driver side
&gt; under
&gt; spare tire well...

Cooler inside the engine bay?  Not a good thing.

&gt; My buddy 's wants to know whether he should keep the 1600dp set-up or
&gt; go
&gt; back to the stock type IV motor (we have access to a couple 2.0L
&gt; engines).

If the 1600 is workable, go for it!  If you want more speed, then the
type IV is the way to go.  Having the tin for the upright engine is a
big plus, and I'd want to make a go of the upright.

&gt; Any one have an idea what's up with the conficting DOM (date of
&gt; manufacture) and VIN#...??
&gt; 
&gt; Bus also has a square boxed Stewart Warner gas heater mounted behind
&gt; driver's side front seat (two unlabeled switches) that looks brand
&gt; new...  Any idea how this works...

They're very dangerous!  Pack it carefully, send it to me, and I'll
dispose of it properly.  You can't be too careful with this!  :)

&gt; BTW this bus was purchased from an impound lot for storage fees due
&gt; and
&gt; PO is not forthcoming with any info regarding Bus.  Luckily we found
&gt; a
&gt; spare key taped to back of visor as PO is being kinda of a jerk about
&gt; turning over any keys...

No kidding!  You might want to consider changing the locks, as the PO
might consider a midnight repossession.

&gt; Nice find for $500... and another Bus saved from the crusher...

Yeah, nice.  I wish I could find one like that!
