Subject: Re: [T2] To New York- Mid Trip Update

This wouldn't happen to be the I-81 that connects Virginia / DC Metro
area to the outskirts of West Virginia, would it?

I drove to West Virginia taking that road, from I-95 (up from Florida).
Grandparents own a cabin out in the middle of literally no where. I took
a 2002 Crown Vic through those roads and I must say, I don't know if a
Transporter can handle those mountain roads without blowing up the
engine! Maybe I'm just not schooled enough in the temperature changes and
hot spots of a VW Flat-4, but it seems about half the time, both ways,
the automatic kept down-shifting, I had to brake constantly... it would
be a road better suited for a Pontiac Fiero, or a Porsche or something.


&gt;you may not want to take the I81 corridor.  seems there is going to be
&gt;mucho snow and from the south you may not be much experienced with the
&gt;truckers in the snow...  also I-81 is very hilly and has some place that
&gt;are quite remote.  the area aroound Harrisburg is VERY congested and
under
&gt;construction,  probably has been under construction for about the last
800
&gt;years.  it is mostly truckers and they fly low...the big &quot;opps&quot; on my
van
&gt;is from a trucker on I-81 near Wilkes Barre..
