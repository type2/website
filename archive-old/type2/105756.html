Subject: Re: [T2] Color Wiring Diagram for 71 Westy?

I scored a Bently at a swap meet that has color wiring diagrams for the
1968 - 1974 model years. It's a real Bentley, copyright by VWoA 1974, ISBN
0-8376-0056-1. Prior to finding this one I had been told the wiring diagrams
were all in B&amp;W after 72 or 73.

Use the ISBN number to search for a copy on the used/rare/out-of-print web
dealers.

Regards,
Dave

&gt; And Richard asked:
&gt; Is it a supplement to the green bentley or just covers the same
information for those years?
&gt;  ------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; I have the orange book, First Edition, published 6/76, that covers 74, 75,
and 76 buses. It has colored wiring
&gt; diagrams in it.
&gt; It is not a Bentley supplement. It is the factory VW manual that Bentley
copied. But Bentley left out some of
&gt; it!
