Subject: RE: [T2] buying and trasnporting questions / laws / dmv?

Things are different with each state however, they are also in some cases very close in what is asked for. I just purchased my bug in AL. I'm from SC. All I had to have was a bill of sale, current insurance, and previous registration (I was transferring a tag from a vehicle that I had just sold). I didn't have a title because AL doesn't give titles for vehicles older than a 74. You could also maybe make a temporary tag that says applied for. Hope this helps. Good luck with your journey. Enjoy the ride!
