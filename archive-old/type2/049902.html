Subject: [T2] Bus Mouse Pad

Hi,

Some time ago I lent my '69er to a VW dealer for a show where they wanted to
display 4 generations of Transporters.

As I result today I received a VW Bus Mouse Pad from Pon. Yes, that's the
Dutch VW importer responsible for the creation of our buses, well, not from
Ben himself of course but the PR department of the company by the same name.
They had these made recently. It has pictures of 15 splits on it. You can
see it on: http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/images/VW_bus_muismat.jpg

I suspect it is produced locally as it has some Dutch print on it, however
it is being sold thru the dealer network for about $4

Enjoy the holidays (it's getting cold but I cheat, I drive a brand new
Eurovan that really outputs heat in less than 1 minute after starting).

BTW - My '69er and the other buses can be seen at
