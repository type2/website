&gt;Double check that you have disconnected:
&gt;
&gt; The throttle cable
&gt; The heat exchanger cables (2)

Easier to loosen the clamp at the base of the flapper and lifting the
flapper valve up. Doing it this way saves wear and tear on the cable and you
don't have to adjust it later.

&gt; The fuel line
&gt; ALL 4 bolts that connect the trans to the block
&gt; All wiring
&gt;
&gt; Anyone think of anything else?

Yes, the 2 15mm headed bolts that hold up the trans above the bellhousing.
Removing these will allow the engine to swing down further, then you don't
have to remove the oil filler or rear tin. Just remove the bumper and coil.
