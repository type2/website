Subject: Re: [T2] bay window market crash?

One market condition that hasn't been mentioned is the Fall vs. Spring
factor.  Before accepting a lower than pleased price, consider storing
it well over the winter and reassess your camping/traveling ambitions
in the spring, to sell or keep it.

Over the past few years I've taken $5k +- $1k* as the general
guidelines for the value of a daily or trip friendly bay window.  That
being the amount you'll need to pay, or put the difference into, for a
daily and cross country bus.     Your price more than reflects this
plus the factors, including the extra money spent being cost of
ownership, not an investment.
