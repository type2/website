&gt; 	I have a type IV built using head gaskets.  I have one side apart

&gt; shim. I would rather not pull the other side and do the switch on that
&gt; side as well.  The compressions are fine on that side and they are dry and
&gt; tight. thanks. jon

it should be all or nothing, so 4 gaskets or no gaskets would be my
reccomendation..I never seem to change both heads at the same time so I
still have 4 head gaskets
