&gt;Excerpts from mail: 14-Jul-98 Refrigerators by &quot;Jeff Stewart&quot;_at_aol_dot_com 
&gt;Is this the cooler looking type? Coleman makes one of these for around
&gt;$75 that will cool your stuff (45 degrees below outside temp) and also
&gt;heat it too. It is ac/dc too. I was thinking of buying one... Has any
&gt;bought one of these?

     I've got an Igloo brand of this creature. I think that 45 degrees is 
more than a little ambitious. I got it for the Inuvik trip, but was 
rather dissapointed with both the low performance and the high power 
draw. On my bus with 2 automotive batteries, any stop longer than about 
12 hours would require the thing be unplugged, unless we wanted to push 
start later. I found that ~25-30 degrees is more accurate. Additionally, 
it takes longer to cool things off than I would like-something like 24 
hours. We ended up using ice quite often during the trip to supplement 
the thermal exchange system it uses. Having bought one, I'm going to side 
with M. Wagner-don't waste your money. Ice is cheap, and won't hose your 
battery. Of course, if you constantly drive, or camp in areas with AC, 
this might not be so bad, but if it's over 90 degrees outside don't count 
on anything under 60 in the unit without adding ice...


Peace,
