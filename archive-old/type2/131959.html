&gt; Cost?
&gt; Swing lever shaft: $100 installed
&gt; Tie rod ends: $250 installed

I bought a fixed (right) tie rod from Bus Depot for for $24.95.
The shop charged me $22.50 to install it.

&gt; Ball Joints: $470 installed
&gt;
I bought ball joints from Bus Depot for $16.95 each (I needed 2).
The shop charged me $90.00 to install both.  The were able to do it 
with the arms on the bus.

Alignment cost $39.95.

&gt; So my question is: What tips do you guys have for getting this done 
&gt; much
&gt; more cheaply? I can buy the balljoints from Busdepot (where I plan on
&gt; getting the tie rod ends from anyway), but I assume I'll have to pull 
&gt; the
&gt; arms out myself and drop them with the balljoints off at a machine 
&gt; shop to
&gt; fit? Any idea on costs?
