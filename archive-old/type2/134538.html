Subject: Re: [T2] repro overrider rubber?

From: &quot;Jason Elm&quot; &lt;jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Does anyone make repro rubber for 68-72 bumper
&gt; overriders?

I'm just getting back on my feet, but it's an item I considered for
repro'ing.  I would have to acquire at least one, unless there's a matched
set (L&amp;R), for making a master.

Things have sort of stalled casting-wise.  I'm looking at a new service
business to raise funds for the casting business.  Water System Operator.  I
go for my licensing test next week.  Since there's very little investment
(around $1200.00), most of the funds will go back into my casting business
and to feed my family.

How rare are the rubber bits, and are they a mirrored set?  I.e. having a
left and right piece, rather than one piece that fits all?  Are the rear
ones the same as the front ones?
