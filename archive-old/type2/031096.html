&gt; Question: seems I've heard that splitting the caliper halves is a BAD
&gt; THING, although my mech seemed surprised at that and said the main thing
&gt; is not to lose the seal, as it's not available.  His main argument for
&gt; splitting them is to make it easier to clean out the bores.
&gt; 
&gt; So what's your experience with splitting/cleaning calipers?

Bentley says to do it ONLY if they are leaking.  in over 20 years of cars
with disk brakes I have never had to split a caliper, so I say Don't do
it!  probably cheaper and easier to pick up one at the local pic n pull or
FLAPS than to fix.
