Subject: Re: [T2] Cracked case

:
&gt;     is it possible to just purchase a case and use what I already have in
my
&gt; current motor? If I went this route, I would essentially be doing a
rebuild
&gt; and need new rings, gaskets, etc, right

new gaskets and you'll have to deal with the bearing situation, ie what size
are your journals and crank, a decent machine shop
should be able to both measure and sell you the correct bearings
