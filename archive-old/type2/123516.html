&lt;&lt; One of them, I don't know what the groups name is.. but the song sounds 
like.. &quot;Sha la-la-la-la live for today!! lalala&quot;. Then &quot;California Dreaming&quot; by 
the Mammas and the Pas, grace slick with Jefferson Airplane, all of that other 
hippie stuff. Sounds great in a Bus!

Todd &gt;&gt;

That'd be &quot;Let's Live For Today&quot; by the Grass Roots...
The Mamas and the Papas...
Try Grace Slick with her husband in &quot;The Great Society&quot;
(Or Signe Tole Anderson in Jefferson Airplane...)

If you really like this stuff, try 
The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band...
Or Skip Spence's (he did a little work with another
band... ;-) strange effort, &quot;Oar&quot;...
