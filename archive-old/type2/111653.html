Subject: &quot;bucking&quot; engine on 77 bus (long)

Hey All-

Anyone experience the following symptoms on a 77 FI engine that is dead stock.

After driving on the highway for a number of hours at about 60 mph(i.e, over two hours so the engine gets nice and warm) the engine will sporadically &quot;buck&quot; or surge to the point where the whole bus jerks forward as a result. Obviously this makes driving occasionally disconcerting as there is not a lot of predictability to it. It can happen randomly and then merrily go away again. At first I thought that the problem only occured when going down hill and this was some sort of &quot;backfire&quot; (without the accomplanying bang) but the problem doesn't seem isolated to that.

I haven't done a lot of investigation but my preliminary guesses are spark plug wires or dist cap. The plugs are pretty new as mem. serves. I *hope* it is not a FI problem as I have heard some horror stories trying to diagnose this.

I am hoping that someone else has expereinced this and can maybe shed some light.

Thanks mucho!

M.
