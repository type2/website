Fortunately, my creative mechanic friend followed the vacuum line from
the
manifold to the booster.  Somewhere under the Bus he found a spot in the
line where a previous owner had spliced in a plastic &quot;t&quot;.  One end of
the
&quot;t&quot; was open.  There is your vacuum leak!  Problem solved.
