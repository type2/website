I will be shipping my van from Detroit to England at the end of April /
Early May

I'd prefer to use a container - preferably a 40' er.

If I can find someone else with similar plans then we can split costs -
which then become a lot more reasonable.

So, If anyone wants to 'Share' a 40' container, Detroit to Southern England
late April/Early May ....then contact me ASAP.

Here's you chance to tour the UK &amp; Europe!

Steve
