Subject: Curtains

After looking through the library, archive and every stinkin' search engine I 
need your help!!!

I have a 71' westy that really needs curtains.

Info:

1.  I have the snaps over the front doors not the sliders
2.  I don't want to spend upwards of $150 for a set 
3.  I don't just want to hang a towel over the windows

Does anyone have fairly accurate measurements and or a procedure for covering 
all of the windows with a nice set of curtains (front too, not just behind 
the driver)?

I would really appreciate any help.  I am not a tailor but could probably 
follow directions fairly well.

Thanks,

Eric the camping exhibitionist w/o curtains
