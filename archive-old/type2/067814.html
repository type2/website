Subject: Solex 32/34 Advice Sought

Hi All,

I have been 'experimenting' with running a pair of 73 Bus dual Solex
32/34's on a 1600 DP TI motor using 67 TIII DP manifolds.  Everything
looks feasibile with some accelerator bar modifications, but I'm concerned
about the goofy 'idle enrichment' vacuum caverns on the left (driver's
side) carb.  Can this be bypassed somehow w/ confidence?  Any advice, esp.
experienced advice, is welcome.  BTW, I'm re-bushing the throttle shafts.
TIA,
