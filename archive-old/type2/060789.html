And I'd lobby for progressively tougher driver's license
restrictions... and recertification tests sooner rather than later, and
*always* after an accident, for all involved parties, no matter who is
at fault. Make it as hard to get a regular license as it is to get a
CDL, or even a commercial aircraft pilot's license. Make it
professional, and only the professionals will be behind the wheels.
Speeding *idiots*, tail-gaters, people who don't pull over for emergency
vehicles, and reckless drivers would hopefully be weeded out, but if
not, stringent regulations would deal with them.
	That's an environmental start, anyways, another placebo just like lower
speed limits or not driving one day per week or eliminating all of the
incompetent drivers or making new cars *just* scrape by the new
emissions specs or other band-aids that we might think of for the
problem.
	We could also try making the price of gasoline $5 per gallon or even
$10... public transportation would seem really attractive after that.
You might even see more home-brew stills popping up to distill alcohol
for converted cars...  
	The real solution will be a change of consciousness, realizing that we
must change to make a difference in the environment.  
	It will especially involve getting older, less-efficient vehicles off
of the road or converted over to some mode of propulsion much less
harmful than the existing one. Our buses are efficient in that they can
carry more weight for less expense than other vehicles can. But most of
us still drive them around often without needing to haul a load, or just
to cruise or whatever. 
	As for me, I'm thinking about a TDI conversion for my '65 EZ camper,
which would sip biodiesel and be lubed with hemp oil.
