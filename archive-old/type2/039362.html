I figured it out. I vented to The List, went back out to give it one
more try (pessimistically), and it worked. Go figure. Mr. Magnet got
lucky, and the trick is to *really* jam the spark plug into the special
socket with the rubber insert (this tool is a necessity), and verrrrry
carefully put the plug in its hole. The hands must not shake....
