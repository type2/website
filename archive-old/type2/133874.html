&lt;&lt; What does FLAPS stand for?  My guess is the local car parts place i.e. 
NAPA.

I've always been confused about dielectric grease... is it an insulator or a
conductor and why is it &quot;wonderful stuff especially on those hard-to-reach
spots&quot;?

Thanks for info
 &gt;&gt;

FLAPS - Friendly Local Auto Parts Store (which may not include your
local VW parts counter if you ask for AC bits... ;-(

Dielectric grease is an anti-corrosion lubricant that is conductive.
I use it all the time on every connector (even a dab on the top o'
the spark plugs...;-)
