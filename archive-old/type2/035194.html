For you volks that'll be there - have a great time.

Sadly, I'm committed to a softball tourney, and can't make trip (from L.A.).
Pop open a cold one for me.

Itch really wanted to go, too. He hasn't leaked a drop of oil all week.
Hasn't stalled those few minutes after the choke opens. I asked him (it?)
what he thought he was? he said: &quot;Itch bin ein Berliner!&quot;.

Booooooooo!!!
