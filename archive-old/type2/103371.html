Subject: Re: [T2] pullling the engine

&gt;Now, do keep in mind that if you use a vice-grip for this it will use
&gt;up a vice-grip point. And as we all know you can only use up a few
&gt;vice-grip points and then the remainder of the grips you own (it could
&gt;be hundreds) will suddenly dissapear, not to be found until after the
&gt;job at hand is completed. :)
&gt;
&gt;those of you who are always one vice-grip short while working on your
&gt;bus will understand this theory.

Actually the Vice Grips operate in herds. If you lose one pair, the others 
begin to leave as a group to search for the the lost Vice Grips. They 
seldom find their way home again.

You will however find some of the stragglers in the spring when you mow the 
yard for the first time. &lt;grin&gt;
