isn't that the truth

&gt; What you need to do here is to drop the engine and transmission package
&gt; down together enough so that the fan housing will clear the rear apron so
&gt; 
&gt; You don't need to completely pull the tranny, or even disconnect the CVs.
&gt; Dropping the tranny halfway sounds like an added level of complexity, but
&gt; it really is pretty easy if you've got another floor jack.

when I have done this I have used a &quot;chain fall&quot;  to support the tranny.
there are some &quot;holes&quot; in the rear tranny support that will hold the hooks
from the chainfall perfectly.  it is much more precise and keeps the floor
area open under the van, also will hold the tranny in any position
indefinately.
