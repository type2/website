&gt; This leads to another question.  Does high-octane gas make your engine run any
&gt; cooler than low octane (assuming no detonation or preignition is occuring with
&gt; either)?  A friend recently told me that he sees significantly lower oil temps
&gt; with 93 octane than with 87 in his air-cooled Westy.  On the one hand, this
&gt; seems to contradict the conservation of energy (mileage and power don't
&gt; change, so where is the extra heat going?) but on the other hand, what I've
&gt; heard about higher octane fuel burning slower makes me think it might just be
&gt; possible.  I haven't had a chance to test this out yet - what do the
&gt; physicists here think?

He probably times the Bus with high-octane fuel in it. If he changes to low
octane without retiming the engine, it's gonna run hot. Timing changes with
octane change.

One of my old Army buddies had a 12v-converted split-window Bus with two
lines scribed on the distributor and one on the clamp. &quot;What's that for?&quot;
One line was the Mexican line, one was the US line. Gas in Mexico at the
time was so low in octane that when he went south of the border for any
length of time, he'd have to retime it to compensate, then retime again
after returning to the US. So! He put a Pertronix in it, timed it on US gas,
and scribed a line on the distributor and on the clamp. Then he drove to
Mexico, bought five gallons of Mexican gas, brought it back home, drove
until he ran the tank dry, put in the Mexican fuel, and retimed the engine
on that gas. Then he scribed another line on the distributor. From then on,
at his first fuel stop in Mexico he set the distributor to the Mexican line,
and at his first fuel stop after returning to the US he set it back. Ya do
what ya gotta.
