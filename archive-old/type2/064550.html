Subject: re: FS: '75 Westy Poptop, $5885

&gt;they are EXTREMELY 
&gt;popular all along the west coast: SF, Boulder, Santa Cruz, Seattle... 
&gt;anyway, if you don't think it's worth as much as i'm asking thats fine, 

I can tell that it's the same thing in the east (specially in Quebec), 
many people want vans and at the spring season most of the vans are very 
expensives for nothing really hot.

It's current to see some vans between '71 ans '79 for more than 6000$, 
this vans are in good shape but it's expensive.

I have to wait one year to find mine. Because I want this model and this 
price...


Everybody may keep cool....



Salut a tous!!
