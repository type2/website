Subject: TALE OF WOE or NEED HELP (Long Version)

Hello Everyone,

Sunday began as a beautiful day with great weather and nothing to do.  It
seemed like the perfect time to go and work on the heat in my '74 Bus.
Well, first I crawled under the bus and noted about 30 years of accumulated
grease, oil, dirt, and armadillos.  So, I spent a couple of hours with a
wire brush, simple green, a chisel, and tons of elbow grease cleaning my
engine and transaxle.  And upon completion, it looked good.  I can actually
read the serial numbers of them.

Ok, back to the heat.  I noticed some problems on the heat exchangers, and
decided to take them off to clean them up and wash them out as described in
the type2 Archive.  With the very first turn of the wrench, the bolt from
the heat exchanger into the heads snapped off (the final bolt holding the
heat exchanger snapped off as well, but that was much later).  I quickly
went to the Muir Book and the Archive and tried Liquid Wrench, Vice Grips,
Propane Torch, (even tried to super-glue a nut onto the bolt and then
unscrew the bolt, but nothing), etc...   How do I get these bolts out?
Where can I get new ones?

After much stress re the bolts, I went ahead and finished cleaning the heat
exchangers.  Even painted them with Rust-O-Leum High Temperature paint.  I
reassembled everything (minus the two sheered bolts), since the bus is my
only means of transportation.  When I cranked the bus, it backfired like
crazy. I did have the bus' back end up on drive-up ramps for almost the
entire day, would that affect it?  It was also very loud and appeared to be
puffing smoke where the two bolts are sheered.  What is causing it to
backfire now? (Could it, hopefully, be where the Liquid Wrench got up in the
heads).  Why does it seem so loud? Seems like the paint is cooking off, what
kind of paint should I have used?  Is the bus safe to drive without all four
bolts through the heat exchanger going into the heads?

Is there any easier way to learn how to work on your bus and be capable of
making your own repairs?  I really want to learn how to do this (Feels great
when you are able to solve a problem), but I can't afford to keep learning
by making mistakes.  I really wish there was someone nearby that actually
knew how to do this that wouldn't mind if I came by and watched (helped
even) when they did any repairs.  Before I do anything I read the Muir and
the Bently Manuals over and over.  Almost needless to say, I obviously did
not grow up working on anything mechanical!

I appreciate all the help on the list. Thanks for taking the time to read
this and offer help.

Thanks,
