&gt; and people could email you if they want the whole 30K shebang?

Such was the result of me trying to post the complete installation
instructions for a BA6 heater that Jack Reed had written for
FUNKENGROOVIN and that he had apparently given to Steven Johnson 
who was kind enough to post again to vanagon_at_lenti.  Unfortunately
does not look like I can post it to Type2, anyone interested can
check the vanagon_at_lenti WWW archives or I will forward the whopping
file to you.
Of course in Ken's defense he does pay for this shebang.
