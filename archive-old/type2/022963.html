&gt;hey all,

&gt;i have a 1975 westy with a 2000cc engine, why is it that when i look for 
&gt;replacement parts in all the catalogs parts are listed as 1800cc 1974 to 
&gt;1975 or 2000cc 1976 to 1979.  Why does everyone act like there was not a 
&gt;2000cc in 1975????

Because there wasn't.  Not in model year 75, which went from about 9/74 to 
8/75.  If your bus has a tag in the drivers door that says it was built in 
9/75 or later, then it is a 76 model year bus.  Confirm this by looking at 
your VIN number on the dashboard or in the engine compartment and seeing if 
it starts with &quot;236&quot; (the &quot;6&quot; means 1976 model year).
