Subject: Re: [T2] Choke Heating Element

&gt; Turn on the ignition.  After 5-10 minutes the heating element area should be
&gt; warm to the touch.  More important, the choke should then be open. Manually
&gt; depress the accelerator linkage to check. If not check for obstructions.

you dont want to leave the ignition on with the engine off for long
if the points happen to be closed the coil could overheat and the points
bake.
I suppose you could stick a timing lamp on there and make sure theyre open
