&gt;&gt;How did you end up doing that without risking the washers falling out?

I spoke to Leonard at AVP who was very helpful and said that 1) there is
only one washer on the typeIV, 2) you were not likely to lose the washer on
the type IV and 3) that removing/repositioning the drive shaft on the type
IV is much easier than a type I.  He was right.  I was easily able to
remove the drive shaft and the spacer remained in position at the bottom of
the hole.

I also have the dual vacuum/retard distributor and it appears to be working
fine.  I think what I might do is to take the distributor to a local
machine shop and have the piece at the bottom of the distributor (dog?)
that mates with the drive shaft, repositioned on the distributor shaft
itself so that it gives me about 1/2 tooth worth of advance relative to the
standard postion.  It should be a fairly simple operation I would think.
Simply remove the pin holding the drive dog to the distributor shaft and
drill a new hole in the shaft at 90 degrees + however many degrees 1/2
tooth is.  Sound reasonable??  Has anyone done this before?  Can anyone
think of any reason why I shoudn't do this?

BTW, how many teeth are in the type IV distributor drive shaft???
