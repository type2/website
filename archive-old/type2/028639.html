Alex,

Go for a 1979 Westy! I love my car.

I have a light weight(removed the air conditioner
system/refrigerator
and other misc non essential accessories) and well
cared for 1979 Westy.

I just rebuilt the engine and my friends are
giving me a lot of heat
for selling it. Just drove from Chicago to Cable,
WI and back no problem.
Held it at 4200 rpm for 8 hours both ways.

Oh! by the way, that's why. No heat! Never had it
really never will.
This and the safety issues are why my wife and I
are looking to purchase a 1999 or 2000 Euro van.
This car was my favorite of all the 6 vw's in my
family.

79 WESTY: His name is Gus, yea 'gus' the magic bus
and well since it's in such great shape
and has many accessories like, aluminum running
boards, air pump, 2 spare/wheels,
600w amp Stereo 10 disc CD player, front air dam,
front air shocks, rear raised right height,
7/8 front sway bar, TUHLE folding bike rack, 4
snow tires, rebuilt seats, new fuel neck,
rebuilt gas tank and fuel lines, custom dark green
corderoy /metalic curtains,
center-council on a 12&quot; sub woofer, chrome tipped
EMPI Duel exhaust, totally
carpeted rear and front interior, and more to talk
about on the engine.

Top end rebuild kit, new oil cooler, pushrod
tubes, re-set the mass Air flow sensor,
torque the head bolts over three days, all painted
all surfaces, new seals, and it's
a little higher than the stock combustion ratio.
Factory air/fuel, valve and timing seting($400).
Bosch high volt coil, bosch distributor and EMPI
wires. Man what haven't I done.

I just put it up and asking $8,000.
Navy Blue with a white top and white bumpers.

I am in the market for a Westfalia camper. I was
wondering what the difference is in horsepower,
between a 1982 Vanagon aircooled, and a 1989
Vanagon watercooled. Which one has a better
reliability record?? Is the 1982 Vanagon engine
exactly the same as the 1979 bus engine?? If it
is, then isn't the 1979 bus lighter in weight than
the 1982 Vanagon?? I need it to be able to go up
hills without a problem. Thanks in advance.....
