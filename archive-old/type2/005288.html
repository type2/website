AND anti-sieze changes the heat transfer from the spark plug to the cylinder
head causing the plug to overheat. It insulates the threads.
[I said it once before but others thought I was full of it.....]

&gt; -I have occasionally(and I stress the word) used graphite(from a drawing
&gt; pencil) on the edges of a plug that was a tight fit.  Tim is correct about
&gt; the anti-sieze.  The stuff is like the plague.  Once it's there, it's
almost
&gt; impossible to clean up.
