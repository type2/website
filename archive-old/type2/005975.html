God, you had to ask...I hope I'm not losing friends on this one---

It's no secret I HATED that bus (sorry, T-2 bus lovers).

I didn't want it. I grew up in VW buses, a 1962 and a 1970; knew all about 
'em. I'd had a 1976 2.0 CA FI in college EXACTLY like the one on the 
website; identical color, condition, even original (selling) dealer (VW of 
Beverly Hills, CA). Weird.

The college one was great, took me on many trips coast to coast, comforted 
me, etc. but I was SO glad to see it go. Like most bays, the steering was 
drifty and vague even when in perfect condition. Gust a little wind across 
the road...ugh!

The road noise at highway speeds was earsplitting. The heat was nearly 
worthless. The seats were only vaguely comfortable, even if reupholstered. 
The shifting was mysterious and required a lengthy &quot;instruction period&quot; for 
anyone who wished to drive it. The camping livability was not like a newer 
Vanagon Westfalia.

After seeing the improvements in the Vanagon (spare tire under the front, 
vastly quieter motor mounts, dropped rear deck, larger rear hatch, 
comfortable seats, improved front crash safety, etc.) and seeing the 
Westfalia details, THAT is what I wanted.

My WIFE wanted this bus. I mean REALLY wanted it. All of the activity/labor 
(on the website) was my desperate attempt to civilize and &quot;Westafalia-ize&quot; 
an otherwise (in my eyes) primitive and unsavory vehicle for her.

I succeeded, but it still wasn't a Westy.

After a year or so, &quot;WE&quot; changed our minds and decided that perhaps a newer 
Westfalia would be better. We sold it and bought a pristine, one-owner 
little old lady, really), always garaged, 1982 that needs a motor rebuild 
soon. So now I am gearing up (and saving up) to do this AGAIN to our 
beautiful White Westy...  ...oh, joy.

Very impressed! I liiike!

I know that I get rust behind my panels (full of expanded polystyrene).

Think I'll rip out the panel latter &amp; do the biz!

BTW

1. was the bus heavier?

2. Why the _at_&amp;$% did you sell it?
