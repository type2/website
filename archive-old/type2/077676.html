Subject: 78' Westy (Possum) Is Alive!

     I finished the install of my rebuilt 2.0 Type IV for Possum this
weekend. Webcam, new pistons, balanced everything, rebuilt heads w/new
seats and all new valves, notched rods, dropped compression to 7.2:1, got
rid of all that useless EGR crap. Anyway I double checked everything, spun
the motor w/out plugs to get oil pressure up. Then I put the plugs in and
hooked up the coil and bang it fired right up and ran perfectly. First time
I rebuilt one of these puppies w/FI, I'm used to waiting for carb bowls to
fill. I am totally sold on FI these days, it doesnt take much to figure out
the simple systems our busses use and it is far superior to carbs in a
stock application IMHO. I ran it at 2000 RPM for 20 minutes to set the cam
then changed the oil and filter. Restarted perfectly, idle was a little
low, set timing to spec, and damn this thing runs great. I put 100 miles on
mixed highway and city did'nt go above 60. Changed the oil and filter again
and it still purrs. Thanks for all the good advice from listees and Bob
Donalds _at_ Boston Engine. I am currently running 10W30 oil but plan to
change it again in 500 miles and go to something better for the long run I
havent decided yet though. Probably a 20W50, I just hope thats okay for the
cooler weather here in Norhtern VA this time of year. I still need to get
my heat sorted out and want to install a set of guages, oil temp, pressure,
and head temp.
     I am looking for a few items which maybe someone close to me has:
Belly pan(covers steering box and pedals) Rear table w/leg, Drivers side
kick panel and fuse box cover. Left rear brake backing plate. The e-brake
cable tube is broken off.

Best Regards and many thanks,
