Subject: Re: [T2] foam pads or sisal fibre pads for my 70 bug seats?

&gt; OK so gonna order these today, but don't know which to use? I see some
&gt; articles saying foam, others using the sisal. I'd appreciate anyone who has
&gt; actually done this giving me a heads up before I tackle this job. I have the
&gt; TMI interior, a hot sunny day, so I think it's time to put those puppies out
&gt; in the sun to loosen them up and quit procrastinating!!!

I used the horse hair repros from Wolfsburg West.  They are perfect fit but
they are firm. I think the original seats were firm but it's hard finding
people who can remember what they felt like back in 1978.
