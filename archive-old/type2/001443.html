Good luck... You'll probably have it to the shop before you get this
message...

I'm dealing with this problem right now.. I've gone through 3 clutch cables
in the past 4-5 months...  Turns out, that the eye on the clutch pedal where
the pedal attaches to the cable via a pin has worn to the point where it's
not much of an eye any more.. The pin will almost slide completely out,
which creates wacky tension on the cable and they snap, always fraying at
the pedal end.. I've just filled the worn out eye with some JB weld, I'll
redrill the hole to perfection, and hope to put it in on Wed.  I hope this
will solve the problem.. If the magnificent wonder known as JB Weld holds up
to the stress...

Cheers,

Tom

Subject:	fraying clutch cable

I'm seeking some advise on what you think I should do. I need to get a new
clutch cable soon, and the robert at biesman's (mechanic) owes me a new one
because supposivly he just put a new cable on there for me the other day.
Well today about half of the strands broke off of the fitting on the peddle
end. So I just put a spacer in btween the clutch arm and the nut by the
engine and tightened it back up again. The only reason I had to do that is
because I need somthing that will hold so I can drive it in the the shop
about 15 miles away. The thing is that I'm afraid that It Is gonna snap
while Im driving there (Like at a light or somthing. I would have it towed
but I can't afford it right now.. what do you recomend I do if it snaps or
looses enough tension to engage the clutch?
