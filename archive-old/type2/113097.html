Subject: Re: [T2] Some clutch questions:

I have statically balanced my pistons to within 1/1000 of a gram and made a jig
like the one on the Corvair craft page to balance the rod's end-to-end..
Unfortunately I had too much variability with my first attempt (+/- 3 gm per,
measurement of the same end) and will need to modify my jig. Currently I only
have a 2 gram difference between my heaviest and lightest rod. I am trying
decide if it is worth the effort for this engine.

I was not going to have the rotating mass balanced as this will be a stock
engine (rev limit 4000 rpm and standard crank), the nearest VW balance shop is
Raby's in GA, and I need to get the engine out of the kitchen and in the vehicle
within the next month.

Back to correctly placing a new pressure plate on an old flywheel or a used
pressure plate on a different flywheel. What issues should I be aware of?

Also, the new crankshaft pilot bearing seal I have (felt/fiber washer VW #
021105311 ) did not come with a metal ferrule to hold/align it in the flywheel.
My existing one seems bent and worn. Anyone no where I could find a replacement
for this metal ferrule?

&gt; &gt; - The flywheel that came off the van has some teeth that are worn and
&gt; &gt; hence my spare flywheel looks to be in better shape. How would I best
&gt; &gt; match my existing pressure plate to the spare flywheel?
&gt;
&gt; jeff,
&gt;
&gt; do you want to balance the engine?
