Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in oil

Absolutely challenging thinking.
Compression too high, never happen.
Blow by would happen with worn out rings, low compression or hole in
piston. 
Now this might get raw fuel in your oil pan.

Bill M.

&gt; I would check the compression on the cylinders as well . If it's to 
&gt; high ,
&gt; then the oil pressure is making it into the cylinders , in other 
&gt; words -
&gt; blow by . Especially if you have a bad injector or cold start valve 
&gt; along
&gt; with blow by , raw fuel will make it into the oil .
