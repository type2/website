Subject: Re: compression test

While we're on the subject, I'm about to purchase a compression tester. 
Anyone have any personal favorite brands? Ones to stay away from? 

I know that Tom Wilson's book says to go with the threaded compression 
tester and to stay away from the rubber conical insert. So, anyone got a 
favorite threaded tester? Or does it matter?
