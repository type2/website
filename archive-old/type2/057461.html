&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I had all my CV boots replaced with parts from RMMW and after a
month of 30
&gt; mile round trip drives to work and some misc. other weekend driving
1 boot
&gt; is totally ripped/shrunken and another shows very serious signs of
&gt; dis-integration also.  I have seen posts this year about this,  but
I guess
&gt; it would never happen to me.  Is this a game of russian roulette??

I'll put in a plug here for Rockford Dura-Boots.  I've had a set on my
bus for a year and a half and they still look nice and new, and this
is in SoCal, home of heat, ozone, etc.  They've outlasted the last set
of Lobro boots by 6 months already.

For more info, see the Rockford web site:

BTW, Rockford seems to be soliciting distributors.  How about one of
our intrepid VW parts vendors here on the list becoming a distributor
for these boots?

&gt; Also,
&gt; I have been stripping all the FI stuff off of this 2.0 79 engine I am
&gt; putting in my '72, and I really don't have a place to &quot;get rid&quot; of
this
&gt; stuff.  Would anyone on the list be interested in any of this stuff?
 Give
&gt; me what you think it's worth to you (pieces or whole) and pay
shipping and
&gt; I'd gladly see it all go to a good home or spare parts bin.   It all
worked
&gt; (?) I'm told by PO but I can't gaurantee anything so judge
accordingly. 
&gt; Otherwise this stuff is going to rot in my barn.

I don't need it, but thanks for thinking of your fellow bus volk! 
Some of those FI bits are mondo expensive, so you'll probably save
someone some $$$.  Good for your Karma!
