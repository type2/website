Subject: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change

Jeff,

    This sounds like a recipe for disaster!!!!!! First rule of jacking up
any car/truck, for anything, LEVEL HARD SURFACE, &quot;NO EXCEPTIONS&quot;! Don't let
your first oil change be your last.
    Another thing, IMHO, I don't think much of those drive on ramps, since
you can only really see the left one, its to easy to get off center on the
other and have one roll over.
    I have lifts in my shop. But when I must use a jack, I have two
Hine-Warner, &quot;professional&quot; 1 1/2 ton floor jacks, not Wally World cheapies.
I always block the wheels, use the floor jack and &quot;Professional&quot; jack stands
(again no cheapies), let the car down on the &quot;jacking point&quot; or frame just
until it makes good contact, and leave the jack in place.
    Look at it this way. If you don't have a good safe place to work, don't
have the proper tools or don't want to buy them. You would be better off
taking it to a VW shop for the oil change!
    Most oil changes are about $15.00 bucks at the discount stores around
here and I bet $30.00 bucks tops anywhere. So what are you saving, a few
bones? Not worth it. Let them get the dirty hands, the worries of waste
disposal, and the danger of something happing, they should have insurance if
they break something.
    A little tail of insanity. I was called over to a friends house once to
give advice on a, in progress brake job. This &quot;Dummy&quot; had his car (a Fo*d)
jacked up on the right front with a bumper jack, and was using a 5 gal can
of some sort for a safety stand, the car wasn't ever resting on the can! Had
it fallen the can would have smashed like a paper cup, along with his legs
which were under the car! His head was in no danger, it was up his
ss!  }:^(
    I understand having to save a buck or two when you can, I have had too
all my life. But sometimes you save money by spending money! Go make a new
pal with your Friendly Handsome local Volkswagen Technician, take it to a VW
shop!

Have a good one!

Howard

&gt; If you have no reason to spin the rear wheels and live on a hill, get a
&gt; pair of ramps (I like the plastic waffle ramps (Wallymart), don't rust
&gt; and won't dig into blacktop like the U-shaped steel ramps, park up hill,
&gt; set the ramps in the rear and drive back onto them.  Block the front
&gt; wheels.  Then your bus will be more level for the oil change, and you
&gt; can do other stuff like adjust the clutch, check the heater flaps
&gt; operation, or clean the battery to starte terminal..

&gt;   &quot;I'm doing my first oil change on my '76 camper that has a 1.7l
&gt;   with Dual Carbs.... Where should I jack the rear end up at? I
&gt;   have a hydraulic floor jack and my drive way is on a hill so I
&gt;   have to jack the rear end up to even get my arm under the
&gt;   exhaust.&quot;
