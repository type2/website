Subject: Question: Removing tail light cluster in 1977 VW Van

Hi folks,
I tried a search first.. it didn't yield the obvious. So, I am taking 
here:

I've a 1977 van &amp; I need to remove the corroded tail light kit (the 
cluster that houses all three bulbs.) I have a complete kit ready to 
replace everything back there, but.. darn, I hate to break what I don't 
need to break.

  I can get the lens off without problem, but I don't want to break 
anything I'll regret later. So, how do I get the tail light cluster OUT 
of the van? Where are the bits that unscrew? I mean, I see some bolts 
that hold it in, but the PO painted everything back there, things got 
melted from who knows when, etc. So, how do I access these screws? Are 
there bolts behind there? How do I get to them?

Thanks in advance!!
Timothy in Phoenix.
