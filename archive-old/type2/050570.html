Subject: [T2] Gas Leak

Hi again,

I recently noticed a gas leak in my Type2.  It was leaking from a small
piece of fuel line right on to the muffler.. I guess I am lucky I didn't
burn up my bus because I had noticed a gas smell for some time and never saw
the leak before.

Anyways, I fixed the faulty fuel line (and checked all other lines) and all
seems well.  The question I have is this.  I replaced my fuel line with a
new piece of regular fuel line... and after some research in the Type2_dot_com
library, I see that I should have used special fuel injection fuel line.  Is
this a must?  Do I need to replace my new fuel line with fuel injection
line?.. The piece I replaced is only 2 inches long... is this something I
need to be worried about?


Thanks
