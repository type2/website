&gt; So what is the best radio setup for a 1971-1979 bus??

That's easy!  Icom IC-706MkIIG all mode tranceiver.  100W out on the HF
bands and 6m and 40W out on
2m and 440Mhz.  Also receives broadcast AM, FM and SW in marvelous mono.
More fun than a barrel of monkeys!  Feed it with 8 ga 
wire direct from the battery, direct the output to the AH-4 tuner and
you'll have reliable communications for hundreds (or even thousands!) of
miles at your fingertips.

Cost is around $1500.

What?  You meant what _stereo_ installation?  Oh.  

Never mind.
