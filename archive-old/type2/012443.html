Subject: clutch question, brain cramp

Hi volks,

When I let the clutch pedal out all the way while the trans. 
is in neutral my Westy jumps forward and the engine dies.  Does 
the cable need to be tightened?  or loosened?

I thought I had the correct amount of freeplay (3/4&quot;),  but my 
idea of freeplay and working resistance could be different from
VW's. :)


Also, for those that are interested I've pretty much put every-
thing back together on the Westy.  The only thing left is the 
newly Kryloned bumpers and the luggage rack.  I'm just waiting
for the Spring thaw so that my rust free Westy stays that way.
Couple months shy of three years.  Not too bad.  :)
