Subject: Fuel Tank removal '72 Westy

Hi Volks:
You may remember me from the post about the Ignition Switch removal for a '78 Loaf - well it turns out I drilled straight through the metal spring, (hence it was gone and I couldn't see it),  you have to depress in order to get the switch out.  Doc, of All Star German Car (Fairfield Calif - good guy, honest, knows Volkswagens in and out - been going to him for 5 years now with all my VW problems) got it out for me (no charge).  He thinks its still the electrical portion of the ignition switch and that something else could be causing the electrical portion to continually blow.

Which leads me to my second problem for the week:  I picked up &quot;new&quot; motor (2.0L) from Erin and Leonard at AVP yesterday.  (With the usual disclaimers, I recommend AVP wholeheartedly for late model Van rebuilt engines.  This is the second engine I have purchased from them - the '78 has the first one).  I figured that before I would install it I would take the gas tank out of the Westy and at least have it cleaned and possibly coated.  I removed the 6 screws holding the panel between the engine compartment and the gas tank (3 each side).  I found two more sheet metal screws I could reach underneath the &quot;lip&quot; just above the transmission.  I see two more screws just above the tranney - but there is no way w/out removing the transmission to get to them.

Does anyone know how many sheet metal screws you have to remove on a '72 Westy to get the panel off to remove the fuel tank?  Also, how hard do you have to pry on the panel to get it out?  I am reticent to put too much upward pressure on it until I know I have all the screws out.

TIA
