Forget it! Thats a no win situation. Be thankful that you passed smog 
(like a new car) and don't try to pollute the rest of us!

&gt; &gt;What kind of tests do you guys in Calf. have to pass?
&gt; 
&gt; Since I kinda started this thread, I'll reply.  I just got smogged on 7/24
&gt; and here are the componenets and results of my tests.  Bear in mind that
&gt; the criteria for different vehicles/years may be different (can anyone
&gt; verify that?), and that I tested with a one-year old catalytic converter
&gt; and muffler.  I've also listed the results of my '94 smog test to show the
&gt; difference a new catalytic converter and muffler make (no other mods or
&gt; major repairs).

&gt; The smog tech said I tested out as good as a new car.  As I said earlier,
&gt; he said he thought that there *was no way* to check the EGR valve
&gt; functioning, and I didn't want to risk telling him how to uncouple the link
&gt; to the throttle and operate the valve manually.  [If anybody needs a Bay
&gt; Area smog station that's quick, friendly and doesn't know how to check the
&gt; EGR valve, I'll be glad to let you know in a private Email].
