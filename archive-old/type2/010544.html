David,

A quick/dirty temporary trick is to snip a short length of suitable I.D. 
tubing, insert a screw into one end (twist it down tight) and slide the other
end onto the open port/tube.  Hope this helps  :-)

&gt; Volks ,
&gt; 
&gt;   I have two tubes coming off my carb that were plugged with a sleeve type 
&gt; plug that slids over the tube to cap it one of the tubes is the same as a 
&gt; fuel line tube exiting the carb. My question is both of these plugs are 
&gt; rotted to heck and I cant find replacements anywhere.  Any tips on how to 
&gt; manufacture something to cap these two openings that were capoped when I got 
&gt; the bus and it was running(I know there supposed to be  capped).
&gt; 
&gt;   Thanks,
