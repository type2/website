Subject: temp head sensor #2
Date: Sun, 8 Apr 2001 11:45:15 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a '77 bus that is failing to run right now. It starts but runs
erratic and is pushing alot of white smoke. The engine is a GD motor, 2.0L
Fuel Infected with about 165,000 miles. I suspected the sensor was bad
because it was getting no voltage at dead cold or even hot. (assuming that
it works when the head gets hot?)

So I removed it. I have tried desperately to put in a replacement but I cant
get the sensor to thread in. I am afraid the soft heads may be stripped, it
was a bitch to get the old sensor out.

So after a brief chat with Jamie Rivers about her condition, the synptoms of
the engine lead to running rich, due to the sensor being 'missing' from the
engine. BUT, I cant get a new sensor in. SO....

Question: Is there a way to bypass this sensor and trick the engine or is
that sensor 100% critical to a running FI motor. I tried to apply 12 volts
to the wire and 'trick it' but it stalls out...

Any ideas or do I pull the motor and re-thread the sensor hole and fix all
the other little things I had meant to do? (new exhaust seals, muffler, push
tod tube seals)
