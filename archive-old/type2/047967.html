A fellow already did the math for us:

If anyone cares to do the math, the important figures are all there:
Fillup price: 30 US cents
Range:        200km, or 10 hours of city driving
Weight:	      700 kg
Efficiency:   Comparable to gas or diesel engines

Naturally, the first factory will be built in France, where most power
plants are nuclear, so electric and air powered vehicles don't just
transfer pollution. ;)
