Subject: Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

 
Okay, so this tunnel is obviously why the rear shift rod cannot be pulled so easily as the front. It all makes sense now.

Didn't you (Karl?) mention modifying the new bushings to fit typical to the older ones? My shifting has been terrible.

One more question, please. The ball on the bottom of the shifter has a little protrusion apparently to line it up/maintain alignment in the cup of the front shift rod that it falls into.

My protrusion seems too short.

Did I just say that?

How long should the protrusion be?

Go easy on me.

Billy

&gt;The rear rod goes thru a &quot;tunnel&quot;(a pipe).  The 2 bellows are on each end of the pipe and seal the tunnel from the elements while the rod goes in at the front and out in the rear.
&gt;
&gt;This tunnel/pipe is what the bushings ride inside of to help keep the rod centered in the tunnel.
&gt;
&gt;Front and rear couple together in the front and then the rear goes 
&gt;straight thru to the rear tranny coupler.
