Subject: Adventure Camper Conversions?
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990427214029.0088fac0_at_popd.ix_dot_netcom_dot_com&gt;

I am considering purchasing a 1972 Adventure Camper.  I was hoping someone
out there might know something about these camper conversions.  The label
on the bus says Adventure Camper Conversions, with Sylmar, CA and
Burlingame, CA listed as locations.  It is a high top camper, and I mean a
really high top.  Didn't have a chance to measure it, but it looks taller
than any high top I have seen.  The fiberglass on the top is damaged in a
few places where it looks like the previous owner hit something overhead.
I have a 71 bus with a 1600 DP now, the 1700 with dual carbs scares me a
little bit, but the camper conversion is cool.  I have not seen one like it.

So anyone know anything about these Adventure campers?  Are they rare?  I
don't remember reading anything about them on the list, checked the
archive, but it wasn't working tonight, so I thought I would ask.

Thanks,
