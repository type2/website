This is getting fun!

First few months of Westies had green canvas for the child's cot, 
upper hammock and the boot that goes on top on the closet to hold the 
child's cot in stationary storage while underway. This is the same 
green canvas used for split screen child's cot.

First 3 months of  pop top are smooth and there are no bump-outs on 
the pop top for the brackets.  The rids were added to the pop tops to 
add strength and reduce buffeting.

Rubber molding around Jalousie windows is 68 only but may have 
carried over into the first few months of the 69 model year.

I need to dig out the Westy parts ordering book but I think the sink 
cabinet is 68 only as well.

Thanks
