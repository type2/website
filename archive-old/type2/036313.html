Subject: Any other Australians?

Hi,
I was wondering if there were any other Australians in here /out there
anywhere? I notice there's only two of us listed on the AIRS site.
I was wanting to discuss parts availability among other things.
Thanks,

Cassandra.

Last night I lay in bed looking up at the stars in the sky
and I thought to myself, &quot;Where the heck is the ceiling?&quot;
