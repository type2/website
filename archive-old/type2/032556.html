Subject: Oil pump attached filters.....

[...]

George and All;

Since the available aftermarket filter-pumps seem to be poorly made, etc., I'd 
be interested in information about obtaining and fitting a VW Mexico factory 
filter-pump to a 1970 Type 2 running a 1600 SP.  

Presumably a VW manufactured unit would be of higher quality and might 
actually fit properly in the engine case.

Further, I understand the Brazilian Type 2s now use a VW Mexico 1600 DP 
engine.  What arrangements do those engine/vehicle combinations have to 
accommodate the rear mount and the filter-pump?

&gt;&gt; The Beetlemex engines solve this problem with a filter attached to the 
pump.  The bad news is that this filter can interfere with the rear bus motor 
mount and possibly with the exhaust. &lt;&lt;
