Bob:
Sorry if my answer was perplexing, but some manuals built in the 60-70's came full
of ATF from the factories. (NOT VW'S) I was surprised when I first saw this, but
found it was specced by the factory!
I understand you have an automatic, Bob (we've been corresponding over 2 years!)
I'll still stand by BOTH statements. ATF would be a good low cost effective flush
for a MANUAL trans. and WHY would anyone care?
There is NO dirty stuff in a tranny but metal chips and the magnet catches them
(the ferrous -magnetic- ones anyway, not the brass)  as they come around.

&gt; use ATF in the auto tranny box
&gt; use 80-90 in the final drive or manual gearbox
