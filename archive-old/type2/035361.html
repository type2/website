Subject: solex 30 pict 3 carb running terrible

Hello, folks--

I’ve been trying for a couple of weeks now to get my 
1600 DP running right again.  [Thanks to all who've 
sent me ideas.]  It began with loss of power at 
acceleration over a period of a couple of weeks--
suggesting obstruction in the fuel delivery system.  
Since then, I’ve done this: 
 
  - drained the tank, sloshed it out a couple of times 
       and replaced the screen inside the tank
  - replaced all fuel line from the tank to the carb
  - rebuilt the carb, a Solex 30 pict 3, including 
       checking for a cracked float
  - replaced the choke element
  - replaced the fuel pump

After a period where it didn’t want to start at all, it 
now catches quickly [put a new Bosch coil, points, and 
plugs in while I was waiting for inspiration] but runs 
AWFUL.  

Before I started improving it a couple weeks ago, it 
idled fine cold, idled a little erratically when warm, 
and wouldn’t accelerate above about 1800-2000 RPM [it 
would cough and drop off, but if I fluttered the 
throttle it would stay at idle again]. Now it surges 
about once a second, backfires loudly.  When the engine 
gets warmed up [a few minutes; it’s about 40 degrees F. 
outside this week] the idle drops, and it also becomes 
even harder to rev above idle.

I’ve been over the carb again today.  I think all the 
tubes and jets are clear--soaked it over night in carb 
cleaner and blew out every opening I could find with 
canned air.  I’ve double checked that it’s the right 
gasket between the top and body of the carb.  Needle 
valve is working okay. The idle bypass screw [cleaned, 
new O-ring] is out 2 3/4 turns, and the idle speed 
screw is out an arbitrary two turns.  The thick paper 
gasket between the carb and the manifold is showing 
wear from all the times I’ve had it on and off, but 
it’s still intact.  I haven’t replaced the air filter, 
but it passes the hold-a-light-behind-it test.

&gt;From its original complaint [poor idle when warm--though
that was only half the problem] I figured I was faced 
with crud in the part of the carb that handles low 
idle, per Hoover’s sermon on 'pre-34 PICT Carb 
Basics.'  Now I don’t know what I’ve got.

Any suggestions or advice would be welcome.

Thanks!
