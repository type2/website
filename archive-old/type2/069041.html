If I had to give it my quick best engineering guess here goes.  The
pressure contact surfaces on a regular allen key when being torqued
are about half of each side immediately after the corners as you turn,
now due to the relatively shallow angle involved pressure at this point
tends to want to deform the female part by shoving outward on the face.
Say if you are turning the following with a key clockwise you get
pressure pushing out on the female socket where shown by the carrots.

This pressure is detrimental because much of the torque being transfered
goes to pushing outward on the socket expanding it risking deforming it
enough to allow the tool to strip it if not hard enough.  Now a 12 point
shape like a socket is no better, in fact is worse since more likely to
strip.  But consider the triple square with its little teeth projecting
sharply into the female part, ALL of the surfaces on the turning edge of
the key are completely in contact and bearing pressure, and furthermore
all at a steeper angle tend not to deform the female part outwards but
instead to twist the bolt more pressure is applied more near
perpendicular to the desired rotation, the optimal method for
transmitting torque, appproacing a cross bar like in your T handle
breaker bar.  The only negative is that you must broach a more
complicated patern in the bolt and the tool must be very hard.

Anyway all this said, I hate the 12 pt personally as it is much
harder to clean out and I feel its a bigger risk not having the
key well seated than it is to only have 6 contact surfaces.  I have
never stripped out a 6 pt if I clean it well and hammer in the key.
I always exchange my 12 for 6 pts.
