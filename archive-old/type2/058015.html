My '71 has a right-hand side heat riser, but there isn't a hole in the
tin bit in question.  It is simply cut smaller and formed to avoid the
heat riser duct that dead-ends in the cylinder finning.  This tin bit
also is cut away to clear the road draft tube that has a curious
S-bend in it in this region.  All these cut-aways make this piece
considerably smaller than the left-hand piece.
