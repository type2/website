Subject: Re: [T2] running engine with no seal, what happens?



&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; i have a quick question. what are the detrimental
&gt; effects of running a type IV engine without the foam
&gt; engine bay seal in place. i have been told that this
&gt; will cause the engine to overheat. whats the real
&gt; story? thanks

On a cold winter day it will probably not overheat.  On a hot summer 
day it will probably overheat badly.

The engine seal is as important to the aircooled engine as the 
radiator hoses are to a watercooled engine.  They direct the &quot;coolent&quot; 
and make sure that it goes to the right place.

In addition, your cooling fan will suck lots of dust and dirt up into 
the engine bay, which isn't good either.  Even my well-sealed engine 
bay gets pretty dust from the tiny air leaks here and there.
