Subject: Re: [T2] Help for a Newbie

Hello David,

    Click reply, and add &quot; type2_at_type2_dot_com &quot; to the &quot;TO&quot; line, or you can Cc
it, either way it will get there! If you only want to post to the list,
delete the senders name, and just use Type2_at_type2_dot_com .
    There should be a Subject: heading at the top of each E-mail, and they
should follow the previous posting, more or less. The rules say &quot;more&quot; but
that seems to fade somewhat as the posts multiply.
    Sorry can't help with volcanic questions, I live in Louisiana, just
Hurricane questions.
    Anyway welcome, questions a encouraged!

Howard
