Subject: More Power!

I want more electrical power.  Are there any recommended alternators out
there that put out more juice?  What I'm looking for is something that puts
out enough power to allow me to have a staff member running their laptop and
a video camera off the 12v of the van while I'm on the road, without
sacrificing having the van batteries getting a full charge.
Should I install a second alternator in my 77 for this?

Thanks,
Sluggo
