&gt;&gt; Hey ho,
&gt;&gt;         My 2l 1980 bus wasn't well after running out of fuel. 
&gt;&gt; Backfires and no idle. I took the carbs off and cleaned them, which 
&gt;&gt; cured the backfire, but when trying
&gt;&gt; to get the baby to idle, I heard a lot of air wooshing out of the l.h 
&gt;&gt; carb. Traced it to a hole (meant to be there) (I put my finger over 
&gt;&gt; it - problem cured). Found a little cap
&gt;&gt; lying on the tinware underneath. Put the cap in the hole - fits like a 
&gt;&gt; glove. Idles beautifully, until it pops out. I've got it held in with 
&gt;&gt; a U clamp at the moment. The manual
&gt;&gt; makes no reference - How should it be held in?
&gt;
&gt; It should be a press fit, but those things often pop out.  You might be 
&gt; able to thread the hole and put in a small plug, but I didn't have that 
&gt; option because I was on a long trip, so I pressed the thing back in, 
&gt; cleaned the area up and covered it with epoxy.  It lasted until I 
&gt; replaced the carb.
