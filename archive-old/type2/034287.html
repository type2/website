If you have 4K to spend...get yourself a NICE bus.  4K will get you something
you can drive cross country, and back.  You could get it a lot faster than
installing all that other stuff and waiting for it to get to your house.
Leave that one as a side project.  You may love it (the 72), but when things
get tight, you need transportation, and it can't wait.  I'd reccommend a nice
splitty ;) but thats personal preference.  No tunnel case trans please 8)

thats what I would do anyways...
