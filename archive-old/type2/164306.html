You can slide a deep-well 14mm socket down over the top of the distributor 
shaft, on top of the magnet sleeve. Tap very gently a few times until the 
magnet sleeve is fully seated. Don't tap too hard or you'll break off the 
top of the magnet sleeve. (Don't ask me how I know this.)

&gt; I currently have 3 vehicles with the Pertronix operating in them.  On each 
&gt; and every one, it has been a B*#*h to get the magnetic circular thingy to 
&gt; fully seat on the distributor drive.  Makes sure it is fully seated and 
&gt; lined up on a horizontal plane with the magnetic pickup.  It it is, the 
&gt; rotor should fit as normal.  Greg
