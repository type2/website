The solution has been mentioned before but is worth repeating. You have to
delete most of the &gt; to fool the list software as I've done below.

 Subject: returned emails

 To the administators

&gt; Am having difficulty getting messages through.  Though I delete most
 of any email I respond to (only quoting 1 or 2 lines) I keep getting
 my emails returned because
 &quot;Your mail to the type2 list has been intercepted and is
 being returned to you because it appears to the list
 server to contain an excessive amount of quoted material.&quot;

 Any help appreciated.
