Subject: Re:Towing with a bus

&gt;Why doesn't a VW bus (auto) have a transmission cooler?  Has anyone ever
&gt;fitted one to their bus?  Has anyone ever installed a transmission
&gt;temperature gauge?  Where is the best place for a sender?
&gt;It's very hilly here where I live and I've been thinking about towing a
&gt;lightweight trailer with my '78 camper this summer, but I kind of always
&gt;thought of the auto tranny as a weak point.  I'd hate to do anything to
&gt;hasten its demise, but the additional room for gear on a small trailer would
&gt;be great.

There would be a pretty easy way to do this sort of if things worked out, but
only when you were doing a rebuild.  The case of a '78 auto tranny is the
standard rabbit-golf autobox, called various codes over the years depending
on what final it was attached to or vehicle it was in.  Now in the Vanagon and
Audi's etc it has a ATF to water cooler mounted up on the front, with
drillings
and slick banjo style bolts that get and return the ATF.  One could either
swap that case into the bus on rebuild, or probably if you had one to look at
drill the Bus case and just plumb using NPT fittings and Aeroquip hose, in
fact the cases if like rabbit cases have little bosses where it was to be
drilled.
You might have to plug some drilling inside as well though as it appears to
me that they grab the ATF at pressure right off the pump and return it a
little
below, probably without whatever drilling is normally present in the case not
drilled, so a little pipe plug or something might have to occur.
Regardless would
be a during rebuild conversion.

Anyway on a total aside, we towed a fairly nice sized 6 sleeping Wheelcamper
pop-up (and this was a nice '69 Wheelcamper, a pretty heavy pop-up for it's
size) extensively thoughout the late 70's and 80's with the '76 bus when I was
a kid.  It was only a 1000 lb camper, but frankly with the stuff we packed
in it,
I don't doubt it was that or more all the time.  The '76 was a 4 spd but
did quite
well, mom even got a ticket for doing about 80 mph (back under the 55
limit) on
the way down to the World's Fair in TN so we never had much problem moving
the thing.  With the stick it was sufficient to tow in/out and around WV,
fairly
hilly in spots to say the least.

Tow away folks, the autobox is a pretty solid tranny, if it is in good
shape, I'd
simply change the ATF every 15k or so and not sweat it so much, but YMMV.
The filter/gasket sets should only be $15 or so at Autozone or wherever.  The
other thing is that although I've never seen one in person, I'm guesing the
late
auto may be replaceable if/when need be with the rabbit box swapping the
final,
others on this list should know better.  I've done this with the Vanagon
box and
if the Bus box is physically the same should be no real problem, likely just
swapping selector lever and throttle lever.
