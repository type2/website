I haven't heard of the Dorper Camper conversion either, but would be 
interested to find out more the book that I am writing, re useful technical 
tips (of the type not found in most workshop manuals!), modifications, 
upgrades and improvements, pertaining to the 1968-79 VW 1600 &amp; 17/18/2000 
Type 2 and related vehicles.

Has anyone heard of the Zenith camper (German) and Fixbo camper (Danish?!) 
conversions?
