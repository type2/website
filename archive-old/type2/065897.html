Subject: Paintjob shock....

Okay, okay....I should have been prepared from our previous discussions
here that I would be in for a blast of reality.  I took myself and my
book of pictures of Bessie, my bus to a local restoration shop today. 
The guy who part owns it is a very nice gentleman, and spent plenty of
time with me looking at the pictures.  He restores mainly German cars,
mostly Porsches, and does incredible work.  And now for the fun part...
after just looking at the pictures and guessing that the bus was
reasonable straight and rust free, he GUESSED that a two tone paint job,
interior, and engine compartment would run between $5k and $6k.  I
grabbed onto a pole for support...the blood rushed to my head and I felt
all dizzy.  But then again...I saw a Porsche he did 15 years ago in his
showroom for sale, and it looks new.  So....I would get a VERY clean bus
on the top end, inside, and in the back for that price.  What do you
guys think?  I was hoping for the $3k to $3500 range, but don't know
what to expect.  I figure two things....I will pay for this job and be
extremely happy with the workmanship for the next 15 years at least, or
drop my price and go with a good job and get what I pay for.  I don't
expect to get my money back, and don't plan on selling anytime soon.

P.S.  This does NOT include putting the bus back together, rubber,
glass, etc...
