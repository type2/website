Subject: Help with Master Cylinder replacement

Hi Everyone,

I just purchased a new (Brazilian) Master Cylinder for my '79 Transporter. I'
just it hooked back up to the vacuum servo and have the reservoir in place.

My problem is in trying to hook back up the brake lines to the cylinder. The
couplings on the brake lines don't seem to want to screw into the master
cylinder at all.

Now, the couplings don't appear to be thread-stripped so my question is are the
threadings universal? Or do they vary from year to year (or model to model).

Is there anything else I may be missing? I don't want to attempt to force them
to screw on (it is my brake system after all :-)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry
