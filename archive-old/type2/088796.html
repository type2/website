Subject: Over heated bus?

Hi all,
Just a simple one for you, I stopped to help a fellow bus driver on the week
end but was not much help to them, so I though some list members may suggest
some things I over looked.
The symptoms were as follows: ~'74 bus, type 1 motor, single carb. (looked
all original and reasonably well kept).
They we're travelling on the high way (camper with 4 people) and had a
sudden loss of power, and then had some smoke coming out of the exhaust
before it died.
They had been there about 30min. before I arrived and none had any
mechanical experience.

My first thought was over heating. I gave the engine a quick once over,
everything appeared in order (just a visual check) for the carb, coil,
points etc, and the engine was cool enough to hold my hand on it by now. The
only thing amiss was the breather cap had been blown off (possibly from blow
by in the rings due to over heating?) The oil level was fine, and the oil
didn't appear to be too old.
Thinking it couldn't be all that bad, we tried to re-start the bus but with
no luck. It only back fired occasionally (through the exhaust) and smoked a
lot.
They had already organised a tow truck to come, so we said our good buy's
and I left them.
Was there anything else I could have done, or failed to check?
I assumed over heating had done some ring/piston/valve damage so they
weren't going to get the bus going again anyway, does that sound right?
Thanks again,
Richard
