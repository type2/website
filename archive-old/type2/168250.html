Subject: Re: [T2] Missiles and guns failed - switching to banging with
  head...

This must have been the most frustrating part of the whole endeavor.

I have been busting up my hands trying to squeeze that linkage down onto the
pin far enough to get the linkage bolt through. At 9:15 PM, I finally decide
to go to Home Depot and buy a clamp that looks identical to the one shown in
the Bentley. Get their, buy it, get home at 10:15 PM.

i immediately slide under the bus and get to work cinching this linkage down
just so I can get the damn fastening bolt in. Never got it in. After several
attempts, I looked in the hole with my little flashlight, and as clear as
day, I can see that I am 5mm short of success...

This is really pissing me off. I clamp the linkage down as hard as I can,
then take some vise grips to see if I can get a little more love out of the
clamp. Tell you what, when they rate those clamps at 300 pound of pressure,
they sure aren't interested in giving you any more.

No here is the straw that broke the camel's back...

Just for the sake of it all, I went up to the steering wheel and moved it
back and forth. After all this shit, I never got rid of the play I am trying
to eliminate!!!!!! Now I don't know if not having the linkage fastened gives
me that effect, but after messing with the wheel, and looking at the
movement of the linkage, I am starting to thing this whole endeavor was
aimed at the wrong component.

I think now I understand what Rich meant by &quot;dead spots&quot; in a steering box.

Fxck, just when I thought I was making headway too.
