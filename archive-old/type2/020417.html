Not sure what  engine code was original to your bus, but AD sounds 
correct.  I can check my Bently manual tonight if you like.  Anyway, 
what really matters, as has been said by another poster, is what 
distributor you have.  The original distributor in 1970 was a 
combination vacuum/mechanical advance type, with ONE vacuum line (i.e., 
vacuum advance only, not vacuum advance and retard as on 1971 and later 
years).  On my 1971 (with original distributor with two vacuum lines), I 
set my timing to 5 deg ATDC, at idle, with all vacuum lines connected. 
The reason I would need to check my Bently manual to be sure, but I 
think your '70 would be something like 5 deg BTDC, at idle with vacuum 
line connected.  Be cautious with my statement though, as I'm not sure 
what the timing mark on your pulley means (again, assuming you have the 
original pully).  I seem to recall that on some of the early years of 
the Bays, you disconnected the vacuum line and timed at 0 degrees, which 
is where the mark on the pulley is positioned on those engines.  To be 
sure about what you are doing, you need the right data, you need to know 
what distributor you have and what the position is of the timing mark on 
your pulley. Let me know if you'd like me to check, and I could pmail 
you from home tonight.

&gt;  oh great, and now i find a message that says 5 deg ATDC... see

&gt; 
&gt; someone please give me an intelligent sounding final answer.  just don't
&gt; give me any more choices!  *g*

&gt; 
&gt; does anyone know what the best timing for a 1970 bus with a AD code
&gt; engine
&gt; would be?  I can't seem to find a definitive answer... i've performed a
&gt; tuneup... and the valve clearance and dwell are set perfectly, but now
&gt; it
&gt; performs much worse than before.  extrapolating from various sources
&gt; seem to
&gt; indicate:
&gt; 
&gt; Static timing at either 0 or 7.5 degrees (Muir)
&gt; 
&gt; dynamic timing at 30 degrees full advance (type2_dot_com) (that would be
&gt; 1.75&quot;
&gt; btdc plus a smidge measured around the diameter of the pulley)
&gt; 
&gt; i'm leaving for a 1000 mile road trip tomorrow afternoon, so i'd love to
&gt; sort it out and not burn out a head or anything....
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in advance... dodger
