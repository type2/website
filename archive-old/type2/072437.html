Pros: VoOoOOOOOOOM! down the highway;
Cons: Glug, glug, glug at the gas station.

Actually, I have dual 40 Dells on my '77 2 litre, and I get MUCH better mileage than I did with the Solexes. I had to replace the Solexes when they started disintegrating through old age and replacements at the time were in excess of 1000 UKP.
