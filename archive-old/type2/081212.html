&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Tomorrow I begin reassembling my engine, but I have a few last minute
&gt; questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1. How important is checking the deck height at TDC?  The two books I have
&gt; do not mention it in their reassembly directions...only the Muir book goes
&gt; into it in the &quot;high performance&quot; section...I'm building my engine stock,
&gt; with the exception of the ignition system.

The possible problem might be too little deck height which would give you
too high compression, which is a aircooled no-no. Other thing might be
unequal heights which for max power you'd like them all the same. That being
said, if your reassembling known stock parts you might be ok.
&gt; 2. An article a friend gave me about rebuilding a VW engine suggests
fitting
&gt; the distributor drive shaft before putting in the cam and crank
&gt; shafts...why?  Is the procedure to install the distributor drive shaft in
&gt; the Muir book adequate?

the Wilson book give a good discription, 1 your less likely to drop the two
shims on the dist drive and if you do you get easily get them out. 2 you can
check the orientation of all recipricating parts, ie the marks on the
crank/cam are in the right place,dist drive right place,mark on dist and
rotor all in the right place, and you can check your work.

&gt; 3. Anything else that I should make sure not to overlook?
&gt;
&gt; --any advice greatly appreciated.
