Subject: Backfiring, and popping, 

First off, I got an awful lot of great help in pmails, and I know many of
them came from this list, when I first posted about my backfiring and
popping from my 81 air cooled.... I tried to reply to each one and say
thanks, but I bet I missed a few, so if those who helped, are reading this,
thank you so very much for the great help and words of support.

Having gone over the vacuum lines, cap, rotor, timing, compression and
leakdown tests, I decided to adjust the AFM and see what happens. Managed to
ID it pretty well, for getting back to zero if I had to, and then set it one
tooth CCW to richen it up, and the symptoms went away.

Getting pretty good at moving the adjuster, I put it back to its original
spot, and the symptoms returned, so I split the difference as best as I
could, and no backfiring or popping..

So, at first, nirvana, but after thinking on it, I expect that I cured the
symptom, but the problem still exists, as I don't see why it would suddenly
go lean and start popping and backfiring.....

So, I will revist everything, and even do a leak down, while blocking the
tailpipe, and getting up close to the heads to see if I have a leak in the
exhaust, etc.... I did the test, but not with an eye towards an exhaust
leak, so a redo is coming up.

I just can't shake the feeling that if I consider it fixed, I will regret
it, in terms of overheating, and risking valve seat issues.....

Once again, my thanks to all for the help so far.

Have a good week.

John
