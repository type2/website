Subject: RE: [T2] Getting locks squared away

Simple equation:  VW bus locks= Steve Sandlin

ssandlin_at_lcc_dot_net  

Don't know him personally, but he's active on
vanagon_dot_com.  I've never heard a bad word about his
work or his prices.  He loves vw vans.  He'll rekey
everything, cut news keys and all that.  He has some
locks sitting around, but maybe you'll have to buy the
engine compartment lock from busdepot or someone else.
 

Peace and blessings,
