Subject: cheap tools

I second the hock shop tool source suggestion.

I had most of my tools stolen awhile back.

I picked up a full (unmatched) set of box/open
wrenches for $5. I had to hunt through a box of
wrenches, but it was worth. They run from snap on to
craftsman to Huskie no-name american made. 

Nice thing is I could afford 3 10mm wrenches--ah, luxury.
