&gt; The problem: Starter turns over but engine won't start until you release

If it is your ignition switch that is at fault. Perhaps you can put a
jumper from the battery to the coil. This will give power to the coil
and cut-off solenoid so that the bus can start if that is the problem.
If the bus starts now that makes the ignition switch a good
possibility.

another way would be to get out the vom w/ a helper and see if &quot;start&quot;
position on the switch still sends 12V back to the coil.
