Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump question

&gt; I was under my bus the other day after a recent engine replacement and
&gt; noticed that the fuel pump was apparently in place, but my older engine had
&gt; an after-market electric fuel pump and the mech carried it over to the new
&gt; (used) engine.

does the old fuel pump work, and the stock fuel pump in a carbed engine is
mechanical on the engine, or if FI then it is electric under the bus.

&gt; the stock pump?  Should I stay with the electric pump and make it safe with
&gt; the relay kit?

if FI then the pump already has the relay just make sure it is wired
correctly,.
