Subject: Re: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

For those who don't remember Corvair's driving around, here are some 
specs.

&amp;quot;Did you remember that the Corvair was offered in turbocharged Corsa form 
in 1965 and 1966? With a curve-hugging, fully independent suspension, over 
1 horsepower for each of its 164 cubic inches of displacement and a 
2,500-lb. curb weight, the Corsa was and remains a pony car alternative 
for iconoclasts.&amp;quot;

So, 2500#/164hp===15.2 lbs/ hp

And I guarantee that they could burn rubber with the best ofthem.
But...every one of them that I ever saw come into the &amp;quot;sevice&amp;quot; station 
where I worked was just hotter than a firecracker!....much hotter than our 
bus and bug engines get!

Cheers, dave

&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Nope it
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; was the success of the Corvair that led Ford to make the Mustang and
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; then to keep up GM
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; had to build the Camaro. They couldn't stuff a V-8 in the rear of the
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Corvair and cubic
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; inches were everything in the 60's... And the useless ability to do
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; burn outs - hard to
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; do in rear engine cars without effort - right?
&lt;/pre&gt;
