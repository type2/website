Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning case parting line

In cleaning the case line I use 320 grit wet/dry paper
the rough up the sealing surface, put airplane glue on
one side of the case and put it together. I have never
had a leak from the case that I know of and I have
been building engines for over 30 years. Have had some
pushrod tubes leak though.. Phil
