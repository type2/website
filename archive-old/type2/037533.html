Subject: distributor vacuum pipe

When I see photos of original ac engines from the late sixties/early
seventies, I see that the vacuum line which connects one of the ports on
the vacuum advance to the distributor is actually three pieces  -  a short
length of braided hose,  a J-shaped metal tube, and another short length of
hose.

On the other hand, on my bus and on most rebuilt engines,  the vacuum line
consists of a simple piece of braided line connecting the advance biscuit
to the carb.

Can anyone fill me in on the purpose of that metal tube on the original
equipment?
Is there any way that the absence of this tube is responsible for the
almost universal hesitation problems we all have?

Jack
