Subject: Cold starting problem

My 72 was having trouble starting when hot, when I bought it a couple of
months ago.  I dutifully installed a booster relay.  Worked lovely.  Now
it's gotten cold here in Kaintucky.  When I try her in the morning the idiot
lights come on, but there's no cranking.  Wait a few hours when it's barely
warmer, and she cranks and starts with no problem.  Jumping her does no
good.  Didn't think it would, since she cranks just fine when she cranks at all.

Suggestions?

Thanks all,
P'rfesser
72 bus of the female persuasion, as yet unnamed
