Subject: Re: [T2] Splitty free to good home - some assembly required

Let me get this straight: I down load the plans. Blow up the plans by a ratio 
of 1 to 20
(inches or metric?). Transfer the enlarged plans to sheet metal (or aluminum 
for a lite
version). Mig weld all the pieces together and I end up with a &quot;new&quot; split 
window...
       If anyone actually gets one of these together, I'd love to see it on 
their web site...
Paper, or whatever...
