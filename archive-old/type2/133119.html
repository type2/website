Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust / high temp painting

Dave,

Sure, no problem.  All of the hi temp stuff that I used came from 

http://www.eastwoodco_dot_com/

Click on powders and then work your way down to the hi temp colors, they 
have changed the way they show colors, but I am pretty sure that I used 
the steel gray on my &quot;hotter&quot; parts.

The intake manifolds and plenum are seen here..

You can see the heater boxes and dump tubes in the same hi temp color 
here:

Folks, I have nothing to do with any commercial part of anything related 
to VW's, but in *my* opinion, powder coating is just freakin stupendous.

You need a $50 used electric oven, a powder coat gun and an absolute 
minimal compressor(2-4 lbs).  THe powder is cheap and as long as your part 
is sandblasted first, it will come out of the oven looking absolutely drop 
dead gorgeous....let cool and put it on the car *now*...don't wait two 
days for it to dry, just use it now....no epa problems..no dangerous 
runoff...just some dry powder left over....If Icould figure out how to 
paint my car with it, I would....

another place with some incredible powders is 
http://www.columbiacoatings_dot_com/
check out the super mirror black for something that will knock your socks 
off...

BTW, 14&quot;rims fit into the oven...  :-))))
OH!  ...and **don't** use your house oven for this...


Cheers, dave

&gt; Dave- Would you mind posting the specific brands, and sources
&gt; ( manufacturer / supplier ) and the colors and inventory numbers
&gt; of the hi-temperature powdercoat materials you have been using?
&gt; There are so many products which fail in actual use.
&gt; Thanx,

&gt; &gt; I have had(so far) excellent results from the hi temperature powder coat
&gt; &gt; paints that I have used.  Not too many miles on them(1500), but they still
&gt; &gt; look like they day I painted them....even on the exhaust pipes next to the
&gt; &gt; heads....and this is a after two 4 hour runs in 85+ weather on the
&gt; &gt; interstate at 75+mph.
