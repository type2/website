Subject: Re: [T2] missing, solution!

Aha!

This just reminded me...my Dad pulls the plugs in his Ch**y S10 and cleans
them.  A week or so later he complains to me that it is not running right.

We spend 3 weeks and $140 at the local &quot;shade tree&quot; to make it run
right...still no good.  Misses weirdly at certain speeds and temperatures.

Finally we sit down with a couple of brewski's and spend 30 minutes
analyzing the situation.  I finally decide that we have checked everything
possible and go buy him new plugs....mention the weirdness to the counter
man who laughs and asks if my Dad is a WD40 fan(he absolutely is!)...

Turns out that wd40 &quot;poisons&quot; the ceramic in the plugs so that it conducts
at certain temperatures.

New plugs....end of story...yes, he did clean his plugs and then sprayed
them with wd40 before he put them back in....

Bob,  did you have wd40 nearby when installing new plugs???&lt;grin&gt;


Cheers, dave

&gt; well after following a rational path and eliminating the possibilities  it
&gt; was apparently the 4 month old Bosch spark plug that failed
&gt;   stuck back in the older one and it ran fine.  of course this has been an
&gt; intermittent problem so maybe it is just &quot;un-intermittent&quot; at the moment
&gt; 
&gt; well will take it for a drive tommorrow.   also need to make two of those
&gt; 150 mile runs to Harrisburg area Fri &amp; Sat so we'll see how it works
&gt; 
&gt; thanks to the several folks that offered suggestions

&gt; &gt;    just want some imput,  last fri my 78 2L FI started having an
&gt; &gt; occasional miss.   very sporatic.   Sat I had to drive about 150 miles and
&gt; &gt; in the begining it ran fine, but the longer I drove the more often it
&gt; &gt; would miss, this is the cyl not fire kind of miss, thought it might be
&gt; &gt; fuel filter, but changed it about 3 months ago..????  on the way back was
&gt; &gt; running almost entirely on 3 cyl.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   snowed and rained yesterday, today very little bit better.  went out and
&gt; &gt; determined it was #2 cyl not firing.  switched injector wires with #1
&gt; &gt; still #2 missing so not power to injectors.  good spark to the plug.  so
&gt; &gt; I'm down to thinking .bad plug(fairly new Boschs) . bad injector
&gt; &gt; . valves  
&gt; &gt; now with valves I would not expect the intermittent nor the total lack of
&gt; &gt; noise.  also it will occasionally fire a few times, then stop again.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; am cold and wet came in. supposed to be better day tommorrow and wed.  I'm
&gt; &gt; off tommorrow anyway so my plan of attack I guess
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; .  compression test
&gt; &gt; .  examine plug while it is out.
&gt; &gt; .  swap in another injector.
&gt; &gt; .  ???
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;   suggestions, comments,?
