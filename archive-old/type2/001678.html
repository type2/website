Hey Ronnie,

    I've never used the one from HF either, but we have worn out several
blasting nozzles, on our pot type blaster, and our cabinet &quot;glass bead&quot;
machine. I have found that the ceramic nozzle is the only one to have, so
ask what type is comes with.
    One question, is this a pot type blaster, or cabinet type? The reason I
ask is you can buy the blasting head from an automotive paint store. Push
the hose in a bag of sand, presto, instant sand blaster --- $15.00.
    See ya!
