Subject: Re: Hardwood floors in a westy

I recently tried to put a wood floor in my 71' westy, I thought it would look 
cool and be fairly resilient to whatever we encountered camping.  

Well, I bought the pergo type tongue and groove wood at Ikea for less than at 
Home Depot and went home and started measuring.  As I had never installed the 
stuff before I asked a contractor friend for some help.  It was decided that 
rather than shooting through the floor (as mentioned previously) we would 
make it a floating floor that was held in by pressure from the edge molding.  
Long story short - when I went to buy the pergo molding at Home Depot I was 
shocked at the cost.  Whereas the flooring was $40 the pergo molding was over 
$105.  That was way over my budget just to have a cool looking floor.

Hey if you have the money it can be done - but rather than fighting with my 
wife over the #%$_at__at_^ bus expenses I bought a pack of self adhesive floor tile 
(heavy duty non glossy marble pattern) and the bus seems happy enough about 
it.

Just my two cents,

Eric 
71' westy
