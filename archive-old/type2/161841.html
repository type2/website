&gt; I can't help but get upset every time I read stuff about CHT gauges.
&gt; 
&gt; I purchased a brand new VDO CHT Gauge from some shop online. I don't remember
&gt; where anymore. Anyway, the CHT gauge NEVER worked. I get so upset over the
&gt; fact that I blew ~$80 bucks on something that simply didn't work. I did
&gt; everything as was instructed. I installed the sender under the spark plug, and
&gt; used all the enclosed wiring. I didn't cut it, or try to extend it in any way.
&gt; I wired it right up to the gauge like I was supposed to and it never
&gt; registered ANY reading whatsoever.
&gt; 
&gt; What's worse is that the place I bought it from doesn't accept returns.

Did you ever try to switch the leads on the back of the gauge? There was a
problem over the past 2 years or so (seems to now be fixed) where some of
the VDO CHT gauges did not work out of the box, but if you reversed the
sender leads they worked perfectly. We had 4 or 5 like this a year+ ago,
none recently.
