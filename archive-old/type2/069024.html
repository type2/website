Various replies have shown that high-reading fuel gauges are
relatively common, due to tank denting from jacks, forklifts, etc.  We
just tried putting 4+ gallons in.  After cranking a bit, it started up
and idled fine.  Drove it home without any problems, and there was no
screeching to be heard.

At this point, my theory is:

- - I have a dented tank, or some other cause of mis-reading fuel gauge
- - the screeching was the fuel pump being unhappy about running dry

I'll be verifying this some evening soon that approximate's last
night's conditions (cool and somewhat humid) to verify that nothing
else seems to be going on, but so far that looks to be the best
theory.  I just have to remember that empty is a needle's-width above
the beginning of reserve....

Thanks much for all the theories.  Something I should check anyway is
the fuel filter, now that I know where it is.
