&lt;&lt; ya know, you're playing a game i don't like, and it took all my compassion 
for you not to copy this note to the type 2 list. i made a reasonable offer
 for this item weeks ago. i need the pad. instead of getting back to me with
 your reply - you bumped my offer up a little and put the item out to the
 community. you could've told me you'd do it for thirty instead - or
 something like that at the very friggin least. &gt;&gt;


You know I don't like people thinking I have a bad way of selling parts. I 
was pretty sure I got back to you about the offer you offered but apparently 
not. You know its not all my fault that you will not be getting this cushion. 
You could have contacted me about the cushion after time passed and I didn't 
get back to you. Next time can you please contact me before posting to the 
whole list about a problem you are having with me. Thanks
