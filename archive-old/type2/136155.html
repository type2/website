Subject: Re: [T2] dizzy rebuild was vac dizzy help....

&gt; I thought so. That pic looks like both hoses are hooked to ported

&gt; zero movement of the diaphram.

the pict34 rear port (RIR) is a manifold vacuum port, he had it hooked
up correctly. Bentley even shows it hooked up as such.
 
&gt; I always run the retard side of the dizzy to manifold vacuum on the
&gt; nipple on the intake manifold.

But you have to use an adapter to change size to the vacuum line size,
if you have the pict34 it already has the correct port and size right
on the distributor. (but that sure doesn't help if you have another
carb ;-)
