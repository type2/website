Subject: My taillights and interior lights sometimes don't go on

--part1_169.268fd52.28fd02db_boundary

When I put on my headlights my taillights tend to not go on unless I play 
with the switch.  The same thing goes for my interior lights (speedometer, 
gas, etc.).  I was thinking maybe the knob was just loose, but am not 100% 
sure.  

Also, just recently I've been getting an odd smell when I change gears and 
have no idea what it is.

Third, I'm looking for a seatbelt cover for my '69 bus.

And lastly, I can't put a hub cap on my left driver side tire because the 
clip is broken.  Does anyone have what I need for that?  

Any help on any of these dilemas would be greatly appreciated.  ;)

Thanks, Tracy
