Hi Sean and list- With luck I'll have the Westy done by Everybus- it  is
mushrooming from &quot;I'll replace the failed clutch to doing the front
/rear seals, CV's replaced, muffler, and gotta think about the rear
bearings and the nice UPIPES Karl Auf. sent me for $15 each (thanks
Karl, money is going out).  Regarding slippage, I had no trouble with
hills, acceleration, and when I pulled the engine now because it began
&quot;chirring&quot; on letting out clutch and then no longer was clutching to go
into gear (I drove home without the clutch) thinking it was the pilot
bearing being dry, the clutch had a separated lining off the pressure
plate side, and it was a cakey, somewhat oily mess blocking, binding
things up. It doesn't smell sulpherous, just like clutch lining.
Judging by the occasional rare &quot;grabbing&quot; when in gear and clutch in,
this may have been going on a long time (parts of the lining causing
it); the disk was nice and shiny and wore a groove into the pressure
plate.  No idea why the Canadian Sachs failed, except 70K ago whern I
put it in I did not do the trans seal and forgot the o-ring in the
flywheel- The seal hardened, flattened and split in 220K and may be the
cause for the oil?  Gotta ask, the larger seal looked fine (I replaced
that then), can that much oil get past the o-ring?  It never left front
puddles.  BTW, my endplay is about .010, gotta shim it up!

&gt; When's the last time you adjusted your clutch?
&gt; 
&gt; If a clutch adjustment doesn't fix your problem, then it's time for a new
&gt; clutch -- your clutch is slipping.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've got a problem with my 1975 T2b bus. It doesn't accelerate anymore. When i push the accelerator pedal it stops accelerating at a certain speed (in 3th gear at +/-50 km/hour and in 4th gear at +/-70 km/hour) when i try to accelerate some more, the engine makes a lot of noise (number of revolutions is increasing, while the speed remains the same). Also, when I slow down on the engine, the exhaust pipe makes some noise, which wasn't there before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What could this be?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Greetz,
&gt; &gt;
