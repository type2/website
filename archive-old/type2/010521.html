	My brand-new Corrado was egged when a few weeks old- the egg shells
chopped right through the new factory paint, down to the grey primer! 
My insurance company paid for respray of the affected 'C' pillar- your
new Westy paint job is just as worthy of support by your insurer. You've
been vandalized, they should cover it. The down-side is that they'll
most likely want a paint shop to fix it- if you had someone paint it,
then have them pay for a return visit. If you painted it yourself,
be firm, demand the best, and I hope you can find a shop that
meets your standards.
