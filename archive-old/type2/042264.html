&gt;Pay attention at the back there.  Are you chewing?

Dave went away for a while there, but now he's back. ;-)

&gt;The other port on it should go to a point on the balance pipework
&gt;under the air cleaner, facing toward the rear.  It will probably be capped
&gt;off at the moment, otherwise you will have a big vacuum leak.

Yes! I know *exactly* what you're talking about! I just replaced the funky
vacuum hose bit w/screw in the end on that with a spiffy official vinyl
jobbie. I didn't know I'd be needing it at the time.

&gt;You are right about the cold air intake hose.  It should be tied to the body
&gt;on a bracket, just above the battery.  It's no big deal if this is missing
&gt;but the air won't be quite as cold as it could be.

Okay, I'll look for that bracket.

&gt;I don't know what the official testing method for this stuff is, I usually
&gt;employ the time-honoured technique of testing vacuum stuff - put a hose on
&gt;it and suck.

So, the vacuum I'd be testing would be in the hose between the thermostatic
unit in the air cleaner duct to the right carb to the diaphgragm unit? Or
both of those little hoses? Because the diaphgram unit looks just like a
mechanical flap that's controlled by the thermostatic unit.
