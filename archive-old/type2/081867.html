Subject: [T2] RE: [VB] Message to VWoA &amp; MVVC

Hi all,=20

Soapbox time and my two cents:

Although I'm not living home in the states right now nor able to attend =
the
show in question, I definitely support sending a message to VW. (It's =
my
parts supply they are screwing with as well.) But, If we as a group are
going to take this action, we need to make sure the word gets out to =
all our
air-cooled brothers and sisters. So, the question: Is the word =
spreading
(being spread) or is this going to become a simple intellectual =
exercise and
a single list discussion?=20

If we want a reaction from &quot;big VW&quot; we need to go out on a broad front =
and
in strength. We also need a clear and simple message: &quot;VW was built on
air-cooled vehicles. They should work to preserve that heritage as much =
as
possible and in any way possible.&quot; (Tell your story and go from =
there...)

To spread that message, we need support not only from the individual
air-cooled owners but also from the affected parts providers (Do you =
guys
have an interest group?), established clubs/groups like vintage bus,
Type2(admins), Neato, Limbo, etc. and as many others as we can get. =
Then, I
can almost guarantee, getting attention (at that show or otherwise) =
will not
be a problem.=20

So, First goal: Black flags at the show on EVERYBODIES aircooled VW and
lobbying of VW trade magazines like VW Trends, Hot VWs etc. (I'm sure
they'll be there) Get them and you start a groundswell.=20

Second goal: Petitions/mail from individuals together with official =
letters
from the above groups to VWoA and VW Germany.=20

Future? What would they do if a bunch of respectable air-coolers pull =
up in
their shiny vintage VWs and start picketing a few dealerships; =
especially at
a point when they are launching a new model....???=20

Together we've got a huge contact net via mail, web, or word of mouth. =
Use
it!

End of the Soapbox drill

P.S. I do P.R. for a living so I know a bit about what I speak... But =
as
always, YMMV.
I'll go put my flame suit on so if you feel the need have at it....

&gt;&gt;If every VW emblem at the show was covered with black cloth,
this would send a message.  If the newspeople are present, a bit of
controversy will make a better story for them.&lt;&lt;
