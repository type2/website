Subject: Bug-a-Palooza 2003 Pics

Heidi and I experienced our first non-bus-exclusive show. Do all beetle owners
think they have to rev their engine really loud to warm it up? Or do they only
do it at 6:30am in the morning?!?

Pics are here:

This, BTW, is a baja-bug pulling a GMC out of a ditch. It wasn't staged. I
sure wish my camera captured video!
