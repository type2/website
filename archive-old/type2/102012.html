Subject: Weber Progressive sucks as the temp drops - and more oil leaks

As the temp in Tennessee went well below 10 degrees, I'm beginning to see the
issues of not having a good choke on my Weber Progressive. If I shift too soon
(RPMs too low) I get stalling and backfiring. Ilk! Fortunately I don't have to
deal with temps this low very often...

Unfortunately, the cold weather has opened up another oil leak. This time I
seem to have oil coming between the two halves of the fan shroud on the front
of the engine. It may be around the fan and the fan is pushing it through the
shroud. Judging by the volume (much more than a trickle), I'm thinking I lost
another oil galley cap. At least it's on the front side and I won't have to
pull the engine - but the repair isn't happening until the temp gets above
freezing!

-Eric
