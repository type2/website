Subject: Re: [T2] GEX

Oh my goodness! I bought a vanagon fuel tank from Cip1 and I had NO idea 
they were not in California. In fact, poking around their web site, I see no 
reference to a physical address. Where are they?

The fact that they sell GEX engines is the reason I don't buy ANYTHING
from Cip1. That and why would a company in another state use
California in the name?!?!?! Makes one wonder...
