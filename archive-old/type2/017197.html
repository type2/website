I just saw something about this in the latest VW Trends magazine.  March

&gt; I have been told that there is a special ring that fits on a bus trany
&gt; that is about four inches wide and can be used to put a starter on an
&gt; engine that is on the bench or ground and started. Does anyone know of
&gt; this ring, or have one to sell.
