Subject: any 1600 conversions

Chad &amp; Jen,

I am very interested in doing this conversion. I posted a question about it
and got several responces, all saying it could be done, but no one knew any
details. I was wondering if you could give me a little help getting
started. I noticed you did not include an email address, both on your post,
and your web page. 

Hope I can talk to you soon.
