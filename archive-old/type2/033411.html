Subject: Mexico deposit

There is indeed a &quot;deposit&quot; to get into Mexico unless you are going to Baja or to the northern half of Sonora, which includes Rocky Point (Puerto Penansco).  Many people believe that getting the deposit back could be a lengthy process due to the general way that the Mexican government works.

Along the same subject... My wife and daughter and I are planning a 2 month trip through Mexico, into Guatemala and Belize, and back and are looking for some other buses who are interested.  Please email me back off of the list!
