&gt; &gt;&gt; OK.  Why do you disconnect the battery by removing the ground cable??
&gt; What's so bad about removing the power cable?? &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Removing the pos cable first can cause an arc from the wire to the post
&gt; which can ignite any flammable gasses in the engine bay.  Gasses that are
&gt; likely to be right there are from the battery itself.
&gt;

And, I would add, that hitting the wrench against anything grounded will
cause no such arc while you are removing the negative cable. The arc caused
by the wrench hitting grounded metal while removing the positive cable has
enough current available to cause a good bit of damage at least to the wrench
if not to the other metal or your hands. If I'm gonna weld, I'd rather use my
welder!
