Subject: possible stock dual carbs for 1600???
Message-ID: &lt;987a295b.246ce399_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

while doing some surfing a few days ago i came across a web site that had a 
bunch of neat stuff from brazil i believe for 1600 bugs and buses.  i forgot 
to mark the site and am wondering if anyone knows to what i refer.??

one of the things was a set of dual solex carbs with proper engine tin with 
preheat hoses and everything. stock air cleaners to go with it.  does anyone, 
possibly ron (bus depot ) know how to get any of  this stuff.  i personally 
would love to put on a complete set of stock factory dual carbs for both my 
early bus and my b*g.  they had a bunch more funky stuff i liked but thats 
another story.

any help would be appreciated.
