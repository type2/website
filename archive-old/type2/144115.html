&gt; What I think I need:
&gt; Alternator kit (don't want any generators)

Don't bother with a &quot;kit&quot;.  Just get a new Bosch alternator and scrounge
up a used German alternator stand and 30A (bug) tin for the shroud.  The
German tin and stand are much better than the Chinese parts in the &quot;kits&quot;
You will also need an &quot;alternator style&quot; fuel pump and pushrod.

&gt; Clean up my tinwork.

Excellent idea.  Dual port cylinder tin usually needs a little brazing
here and there to fix cracks.

&gt; Front pulley. (Can a stock pulley be used with the lightened flywheel
&gt; on the other end?)

Yes, but why are you using a light flywheel on a bus?

&gt; Muffler (I have stock heater boxes.. A few sets in fact)

Get a Liebstritz (spelling?)  They cost more than Mexican or Brazilian
mufflers and are well worth it.  Do yourself a favor and put anti-sieze on
the muffler studs.

The heater boxes might needs some TLC if the housings are loose on the
pipes.  A bit of brazing will make them good as new.
