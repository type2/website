Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signals

&gt;hello Ray   What I do is get some CRC contact
cleaner and spray  the switch 
out, then lube it with Wurth HMS 2ooo spray lube,
then wrap the  colunm with 
electric tape a couple of times where the switch
sits and reinstall  the switch  
later  mark Dearing

Excellent!  Thanks Mark.  Of course, I manage to
break a wire from it's soldering point.  Brown
with black tracer I think.  Now what.  Don't even
think there's enough wire to resolder it.  May
have to solder a short extension.  I have NO
soldering skills.  

Tony, it's a 1970.  Sorry I forgot that.  Used to
be in my sig.
