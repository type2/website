&gt;   The wing windows: They are flapping around on their little pivots.  I
 really wish I had known about their workings being behind the panels
 when I had the panels off.  Well, I know where they are now, the next
 time I have one off they will get the attention they need.  One thing I
 do need is a pin that holds on the knob assembly.  Is there something I
 could rig in it's place?

I hate to tell you this but I can almost 100% guarantee that the pivot pin is sheared off on the bottom. No
amount of tightning the clamp will stop the window from flapping in the breeze.
I have a stack of nice pretty ones.....that are worthless because the pivot pin is broken.
Rust 1st appears at the pin, then the window gets a little harder to open, so you apply a little more
pressure, then it opens so easily......
