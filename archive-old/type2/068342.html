Subject: FS: 25 VW's in Missouri

Just responded to an ad in the paper. This guy has 25 VW's, mostly
from the 70's, including a few convertibles and some busses. Some run
(at least back when he parked them), some have titles.

Location is close to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The guy would
preferably sell all of them to the highest bidder, if possible. In any
event, he's asking interested parties to show up at his farm on
November 23rd at 10 am.

Wanna round up a posse? Bob, Jon, Pete ?

Sami
