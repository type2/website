I would just like to say I know Jack D. and this bus, it is totally killer and a
steal at this price!!  I wish I had the dough or room to buy this bus myself.
Jack really did a excellent job on this very complete old Westy Camper.  If you
are loking for a real cherry early Westy I think one would be hard pressed to
find a nicer bus at this price!
