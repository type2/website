Hello, all-

Here's a little problem I've been noodling with for some time. I have a 74
Day Camper with an AVP rebuilt 1800 with about 14,000 miles, running
hydraulic lifters, Weber progressive, and SVDA distributor. Every time I
open up the air cleaner cover I find about two tablespoons worth of oil,
maybe even a little more than that. The breather is installed and
functional.

Here's the thing....the bus runs great! It starts in any weather with only
one or two turns of the starter, runs strong in the city and on the highway,
gets 15/20 MPG, doesn't smoke, uses no oil at all between changes, doesn't
leak a drop from anywhere, and the oil doesn't have even the faintest smell
of gasoline at any time. The oil has collected there since day one after
installing this engine and will reappear within 40-50 miles of driving after
cleaning. This happens with dyno oil in 30 weight, 40 weight, and 20W50.
Also happens with synthetic blends and full synthetics in 5W50 and 20W50
weights. It happens in all weather-- hot, cold, wet, dry, etc.

I guess I should do a compression test but the bus runs so well that I have
to believe the compression is good. But I'll do the test anyway just to be
sure.

Sooooo, any ideas out there. Any guidance is appreciated.

Thanks,
Dave
