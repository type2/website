Subject: Re: [T2] stripped stud

I think the thing to do is to send it back to AVP - on their dime, of
course - and have them get it right.  That said, I've used successfully the
Loctite &quot;Form-a-Thread&quot; product

http://doityourself_dot_com/store/6910806.htm

where there was still some thread available in the female hole.

&gt; Well, my new head I just got back from AVP wasn't put thru the tests I
guess.
&gt; As I just tried to tighten the manifold with a 3/8 drive ratchet over the
&gt; plastic spacer for a weber carb and it pulled one stud straight out.  I
was
&gt; being extra gentle as I didn't want to crunch the plastic spacer so I know
I
&gt; didn't over torque.
&gt;
&gt; I really don't want to have to ship it back to AVP again!!!  This stud is
one
&gt; of the 4 that you bolt the manifold down with and I want it to be tight so
it
&gt; doesn't leak.
