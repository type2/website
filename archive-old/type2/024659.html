Ok, Mad Uncle Dave suggested I send this in, so even
though it's my creation, blame him, not me :-)

To the tune of &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot; from &quot;The Wizard
of Oz....&quot; 

I could drive with all my power 
Wear a smile, not a scow-el
driving at high stakes....

Oh the stops I'd be makin' 
and the turns I'd be takin'
If I only had some brakes...

I could stop without strainin'
and my heart would not be drainin'
all the blood from my face

I could stop on a dime
and give you change o' nine
if I only had some brakes...

Oh, I could tell you why...
the pedal don't go to the floor
I would make some stops I never made before
and then I'd stop - and stop some more!

I would be a really rollin'
drivin' 'er like she's stolen
goin' everyplace

I would dance and be merry
life would be a ding-a-derry
if I only had some brakes.....!!!
