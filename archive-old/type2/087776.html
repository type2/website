Subject: [T2] Bad intake valve

Can one cylinder be made in-operative?

Yes it can.


&gt;I have a  2.0L fuel inj. hydraulic lifter engine in a '76 Camper
here,,, he
&gt;wants to drive it a few thousand miles before he drops the engine to
repair &gt;it.

So, I thought I'd ask the list for positive comments about disabling one
cylinder

&gt;I know the bad things about driving with a dropped valve seat, burned
&gt;valve,,
&gt;but I have personal experience that says it is possible to drive a few
&gt;thousand
&gt;miles home to a place you can repair it and save money, and time. 

As many know on this list, I drove my engine with #3 pushing and amazing
10psi.  When I finally got a used head, I drove it from NC to Nashville,
TN.  Thinking in the same respect that you are, I pulled the injector
sender to the injector on #3 since it was not helping any.  I believe
this was a bad mistake.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the fuel injector
is cooled slightly by the fuel passing around it.  When I got to my
destination to drop my engine (FasterLaster's), the injector and seals
were actually melted and severely deformed.  I had to replace them.  I
am not sure which is better as far as running a cylinder like you have
it, or with the injector sender and all that pulled from it, but that's
what happened to mine after driving with it disconnected from the
injector.
 


&gt;in the past I have had discussions about making the bad cylinder
in-&gt;operative,,,
&gt;and I have always said,,, it is a waste of time.  Just drive it and
adjust &gt;the
&gt;valve lash every morning! 

Correct, you must watch the valves very closely. Mine became loose just
before I got to Jason's and it nearly broke the cap (technical term) on
the end of the valve spring. 

My experience in this situation.  Good luck.
