Phil:

Just a small amount of wheel bearing grease should be fine.  Just smear a
thin film on whatever you put the hose on.

Thank you!

 I can't get the little #_at_*%!!! two inch hose joints reinstalled on the
 gas tank vent tubes. (Using new VW fuel hose.)
 
 Is there some kind of authorized lubricant for fuel hoses? Someone
 earlier suggested Astroglide for the window seals, but I'm a little
 nervous that one of the ingredients (the mint flavoring, perhaps) might
 not treat the hoses kindly over time.I suppose the generic equivalent
 would be glycerin, tho' this is a bit harder to  um, er, come by.
 
 Other things I've contemplated: lightweight honing oil, moly grease,
 cornstarch (might turn the gas to gravy in the tank?).
 
 I really, really would like to know the best way to get those little
 hoses on there for the duration.
