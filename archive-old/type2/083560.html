&gt; Morning!

&gt; Well as per my previous post, the engine is out, and the input shaft *was*
&gt; sliding out :-(
&gt;
&gt; So I've been told that this is a circlip that holds this piece in. Here are
&gt; my questions:

Is it a circlip or a threaded stud?  IIRC, it isn't all that quick of a
fix.  It involves some disassembly.

&gt;
&gt; 1. Repair or Replace, I am kinding leaning to replace, when I drove the bus
&gt; home from the PO's place, I noticed that even with the clutch depressed the
&gt; bus seemed to be &quot;dragging&quot; but not apparently because of the clutch. I've
&gt; also noticed that the tranny is covered in thick goo. I am betting that if I
&gt; check the fluid level I'll be in for a big surprise.

The question is if the transmission stays in all gears and doesn't make
any nasty noises.  I've never heard of a transmission causing undue drag
without quickly doing something else nasty.
 &gt;
&gt; 2. How difficult to repair? Can it be done in the bus?

I think it has to come out.
