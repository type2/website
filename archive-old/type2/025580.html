Dear list,
I have a new old westy tent, yellow walls, blue roof, stripped awning, very
pretty.  It's in the living room right now as I try to assemble it for the
first time.  Can anyone on the list &quot;talk&quot; me through the set up?
My first three attempts have resulted in 1950's cartoon style tents, I'm
giggling and stumped.  There are 4 obvious bottom legs and 4 obvious corner
pieces then 9 straight pieces tapered on one end, then 2 bent T pieces.
Thanks in advance and feel free to heckle me.
Jody
