it was
&gt; &gt;a woodstock edition.

Since Woodstock occured in August '69, there isn't much chance of a
'69 vehicle being called a &quot;woodstock edition&quot; by VW.  

I doubt that VW was all that proud of being associated with the
&quot;counterculture&quot; in 1969 when your bus was built.  Not many hippies
walked into VW showrooms and bought new cars.  Most &quot;hippiemobiles&quot;
were well-worn used cars by the time the hippies came into ownership.

When was the first &quot;positive&quot; acknowlegement by VW of the &quot;hippie&quot;
image?  The Jerry Garcia memorial bus ad leaps to mind, but there
might be earlier examples.
