Thanks for the good explanation IRT  #3 retard.  So, does this mean I lose
the retard on #3 when/if  I convert to Petronix?   Do I keep the retard on
a points triggered
electronic?  I think the answer is yes to both.  Last question - how bad is
it for my motor
(68sp upright) to lose that retard?  The more I learn about this, the more
I realize I don't know.
Thanks much.
