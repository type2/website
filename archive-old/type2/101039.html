&gt; there stock heads, if so how have they performed and have there been any 
&gt; problems. I have spoken with them and they say they do reinforce the seats 
&gt; to prevent the dropped seat problem. Any insight would be great. I know 
&gt; someone that has a new unused set. They are remanufactured of course.

I got a set on an engine and within 6 months most of the valves had sunk
into the seats,  seats didn't come out but such poor quality metal that
they just got eaten up by the valves...

YMMV
