Songie asked re 009 distr.

&gt;1. Hubby just put a Bosch 009 distributor in my 78 (2L) bus. What should
&gt;the advance be set at? Right now it's set at 7.5 degrees.

I'm curious- thought 2l engines (FI) had special contacts in distributor
to let brain know timing relative to injectors- how did you get an 009 to
work?    Mike Benthin in NJ   78 Westie
