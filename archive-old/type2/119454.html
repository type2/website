&gt;Richard, is this the switch that someone's making in the US, as opposed to

&gt;How much are they going for, where can you buy them and how good are they?

It's a US repro switch from Ventura Warehouse Group. I got it from Busted Bus. It was half the price of Brazillian switch (bleech, if you've ever handled one) and I'm stunned by the quality of the reproduction. The only weird thing is the two extra leads which I was hoping to get some guidance on.
