&gt;Finally, can anybody comment on price of new cv boots?
&gt;One place wants hour labor/side or ~$125 total. Other
&gt;place wants ~$240 total!

Patrick, sounds like you've got a leprican in your pocket. ;-) Not only did you score a good bus, but it's giving you the opportunity to start bonding with it now.

$120 is right at $100 more than I pay to have CV boots replaced. It takes about 2 hours to earn that $100 if you don't inspect your CVs (that's a high estimate, figuring you don't know what you're doing at all and that you have to work hard to get your CV boots off). Of course, cleaning and inspecting your CVs is also critical, especially if they've been run without boots...but if you're going to a shop for boot replacement, they're not going to inspect the CVs either. They're certainly not going to clean and repack the CVs and there are some critical practices in cleaning and repacking (like keeping the balls in their original positions) that would keep me from trusting the job to any but the *most* experienced and trustworthy shops.

So when you decide you want to do this job yourself, check the archives at www.type2_dot_com; look in your Muir book (if you don't have one, just consider that part of the initial tools purchase); and then holler at us if you need help.

I will tell you from the onset that the critical success factors for replacing CV boots are:

- you must clean the cv bolt heads
- you must use a 12-point allen key if you have a 12-point bolt
- you must use leverage coupled with patience to remove the CV bolts
- you must reinstall the bolts using the proper torque.

The other parts of the process, including inspection, are well documented in John Muir's book, which I recommend for this particular procedure. Assuming you don't have the book and you don't have the correct allen wrench, you're probably looking at about $50 max initial investment, including parts. I recommend buying the boots (not kits) and getting a big tube of moly grease from your FLAPS--the kind that goes in a grease gun. You'll save about $10 this way--enough to buy the allen wrench. 

Also if you have the 6-point allen bolts, it's a 6mm allen wrench. You'll probably need to buy a set of metric wrenches. Mine goes from 2.5 to 10 or 11. It  cost around $10. If you have a 12-point allen head, you have to buy a special key that costs like $8 or $10 mail-order...never found it local.

If you decide to have someone else do the work, you should ask if they clean and inspect the joints as part of the service...and ask if they disassemble or if they just *tank clean* the joints. You have to disassemble the joints to inspect them, but that's where you see the opportunity for mixing up the balls...sort of a Catch 22 when you're having someone else do the work.

Thanks! Joe
