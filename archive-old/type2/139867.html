&gt; I'm moving next door and I need to get the deluxe('71, 1600 DP, 34 PICT 3,

&gt; cable I can limp her over there. It steers and stops and even all tires are
&gt; up!!!!

for that short a distance a come along or block and tackle might be
sufficient, one direction should be downhill I would guess

  get someone to sit inside and steer and brake while you just pull on the
winch handle. might take an hour but your not as likely to mess something
up and probably will be less trying on your nerves.
