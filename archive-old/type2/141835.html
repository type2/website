Subject: Cars

Anyone seen the movie trailer for the upcoming Pixar movie, &quot;Cars&quot;?  It
includes a sleepy Type II bus next to a jeep.  The bus tells the jeep that
the traffic light they are both at blinks slower each time...  The jeeps
response, &quot;the 60's weren't very good to you were they?&quot;  It appears that
the bus may have a good roll in this film.
