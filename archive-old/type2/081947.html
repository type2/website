Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [[T2] Installing master cylinder]

I concur with that and have done it myself several times.  My basic approach
(particularly on these older vehicles) is to go ahead and get a complete
flush from the reservoir al the way out to the WC/calipers.  Current auto
mfg. recommendations are to flush completely every 2 years.  How many of us
do that?  And what price do we pay for not?  Brake fluid is highly
hydrophilic (water-loving) and this fact contributes greatly to steel lines
rusting from the inside out.  I personally want a high level of confidence
when I mash on that pedal that what I'm expecting to happen really does
happen.  Of course one of the great things about this country is that it's
your a**, no one's gonna make you do it if you don't want to.  I just hope
I'm not in front of you when it all comes tumblin' down...

&gt; What I've typically done in the past instead of a bench bleed is to
install
&gt; the master cylinder, hook up all the hoses including the fluid supply.
Then
&gt; to get the air bubble out I typically will crack the lines coming into the
&gt; master cylinder and then have someone work the pedal until bubbles stop
&gt; oozing out past the threads and it's just clean fluid.  Then I just
tighten
&gt; the lines back up and go on to the regular bleeding.  It's worked each
time
&gt; I've used it.

&gt; ------
&gt; Its called a 'bench bleed'. Older replacement GM MCs come with a set of
&gt; plugs
&gt; for the ports and advise to fill the MC with fluid and depress the plunger
&gt; an
&gt; inch or so. You will see little bubbles float up. You wait 20 sec and then
&gt; do
&gt; it again. You keep doing this until you see no more bubbles.
