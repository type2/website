&gt;One of the POs has obviously replaced the sender in the tank.
&gt;Unfortunately, this was done the quick and dirty way by cutting
&gt;a hole above the fuel tank to gain access to the sender. Could
&gt;an incorrect sender cause this problem? (such as a 68-73).

&gt;Quick and dirty, yes.  Incredibly useful, yes.  IMHO, there should have
&gt;been a little panel that unscrewed there to begin with.  I've had all
&gt;kinds of trials and tribulations with my gas sender, replacing it a few
&gt;times.  Considering the vagueness of most parts matching in Volkswagon,&gt;
&gt;the sometimes questionable quality of parts, and the importance of the
&gt;gas sender, I think a hole cut over it is one of the greatest additions
&gt;to a bus.

I am tempted to do it to my 1976 camper as the sender is not working.  What
do listees think about structural integrity and the possibility of fuel
spurting into the cabin from the tank in an accident with the obvious
potential to toast the occupants?
