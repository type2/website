Subject: K&amp;N airfilters

Does any one know if K&amp;N airfilters will add any ooomph to
the Vanagon. The owner of Veeparts says it will give a
bit more get up and go in the midrange. As this filter runs
about $60 - $70 dollars US and the same in CDN I would
like to confirm this statement prior to spending way too much
money on an Air filter.
