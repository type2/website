Subject: Shake, Rattle and Roll....

So I finally got to take my bus for a trip further
today than simply around the block. It is the first
real drive I have done in nearly 5 years, and now that
I have new Hankooks and new KYB shocks on her, the
handling is like a dream compared to before.

However, I am concerned about how much more I feel
every bump in the road. Granted, since I haven't
driven my bus in so long, maybe it is just that I have
gotten WAY to used to driving a car like my Civic or
my old 4Runner. It just seems funny that with the new
shocks and tires, I still feel and hear all the cracks
in the road, and let's not get started on speed
bumps... holy crap!

I guess I just want to know if I have become too soft
from driving modern cars, or if there is something I
am missing that I can do?
