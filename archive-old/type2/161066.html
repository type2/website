&gt; i guess my real queston is there any way to
&gt;bench test the fuel pump.   i have an ac to dc 12 volt  converter in my
&gt;shop.     can i hook up the two leads and  try to pump some fuel from a gas
&gt;can or something to eliminate the faulty fuel pump theory?

Sure. Just run some hose into a gas can:

&gt;also if i need
&gt;to change the fuel lines i would like to find out some of your opinions on
&gt;where to find the best.

Continental 7x3mm high pressure hose from the online vendors. N 020 281 1.
Get the smooth jacket, not the braided stuff.

&gt;i want all of them from the pickup tube all the
&gt;way to the injectors.   thank you guys in advance.

You have to buy bulk hose and cut it yourself:
