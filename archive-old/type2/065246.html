Subject: Re: Belly pan removal ('62 23-Window)

&gt;If anyone has any advice on how to remove the belly pan,
&gt;we'd love to hear about it.  If any of the books (at
&gt;the moment we have only the Muir book) cover such work,
&gt;we like to hear that too.

The belly pan is welded on, so you will have to drill out the welds and cut
it off.

I don't know of any books that detail the procedure.

New reproduction replacement pans are available from Das Bulli Haus:
