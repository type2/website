    Hello all,

Well, I got my V'gon back up and running...and a tremendous decrease in oil
leaks!!! Too bad I couldn't get it going for BNNTA, just saw the pic some
folks took of the event.  Hopefully, JRMBBC II will grow to be that big
someday!!

 I want to publicly thank Rick Taylor for his help and parts for getting the
V'gon running again, and remind everyone...shameless plug here....next
weekend is the JRMBBC II !!!

For info about JRMBBC II, go to http://my.treeway_dot_com/OKArt
