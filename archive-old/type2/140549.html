Subject: Re: [T2] Hello again

    May be a vacume leak, check for a hose off somewhere. Is the balance
hose/tube between the carburators on, power brake bouster hose, etc?
    You may also want to check the dwell, the points may have closed up. If
so make sure the distributor cam has lube on it.

&gt; I made it home. And after 700 mile the bus now won't idle at all.
&gt;
&gt; Ideas to check?
