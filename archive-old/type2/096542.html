Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Tail Light Assemblies

Tim,

Just got thru doing this on my bus.  While the housings appeared to me
to be an exact match, I didn't like the new metal parts that came with 
them.

Mine originally had two of the 1/2 size lugs on one bulb while the new
metal holders were different.  The new metal holders had the lugs all
pointing straight away from the metal while the originals were at a 90
degree angle.  This would have kept me from being able to get the rear
dust/water protective cover to fit right.

I poped the metal parts out of my old housings(they were in excellent 
shape) and the fit exactly into the new housings...appear to work great!

Since the new housings did not include the back cover, the original ones
snapped on perfectly.

Mine came from busdepot.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt; Last week, I won an 'auction' for some new tail light assemblies
&gt; &gt; &gt; for my '78 from a gent in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  (Apparently someone
&gt; &gt; &gt; with an &quot;in&quot; -- he's always sellin' &quot;new&quot; Bus stuff...)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I know this guy and have bought several items from him direct, they are
&gt; &gt;always good quality for Brazilian parts.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; At least you knew before hand you were buying Brazilian parts.
&gt; 
&gt; Having wanted to replace my rear turn signal/brake housings for a long time 
&gt; due to corroded bulb contacts, I finally order new stuff from Bus Depot. 
&gt; The lenses were clearly marked as Brazilian on the web site and in the 
&gt; catalog as a separate part. The housings, however, were only identified 
&gt; with the VW part no., again as a separate item. I assumed that meant they 
&gt; were VW parts because they did not offer to mention those were Brazilian as 
&gt; well. Shame on me for assuming an honest presentation.
&gt; 
&gt; What I received was lenses and housings shrink wrapped together as a whole 
&gt; unit, all made in Brazil. Note the catalog does not show the two items sold 
&gt; as a unit. The lenses look fine. The housings, however, are nothing like 
&gt; originals. I haven't looked into it further but am hoping I can remove the 
&gt; metal contacts and install them in my original housings. Just know for sure 
&gt; that if Bus Depot shows a German VW part no., it does not follow that you 
&gt; will get a real part. Same goes for most vendors. I consider this 
&gt; deceptive, but par for the course in todays market. Really no different 
&gt; than when you ask the quicky lube if they use a VW filter for your oil 
&gt; change, they say yes, and then they put a Havoline or Quaker State filter 
&gt; on there. After all, Havoline and Quaker state list it as a VW filter in 
&gt; their catalog, so it's not really lying, is it??? 
&gt;
