If memory serves, the oil pressure spec is:
30wt oil_at_180F and 2500RPM, 42psi new/28psi wear limit.

I'd switch to straight wt oil and if the outside air temp is consistently
above 68F, the book calls for SAE 40.

I don't have a tachometer, but my tires are stock size, transmission is
original and, as I had mentioned, I was doing 60 to 65 MPH, when I got these
readings.
