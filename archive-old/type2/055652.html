Subject: Chevrolet copies VW

I know it's not Friday, but I just can't wait....

Well, it's taken GM 20 years to figure out how to do it, but the new
Venture van has managed to finally build seats on a new vehicle that are
as uncomfortable as the original seats in my Westie....what's that you
say &quot;a copy is the best kind of compliment&quot;.....

A supplier took me out in his new company van for lunch &amp; a plant tour
on Monday (he knows I'm a Bus nut &amp; I really think he got a van cause
he's a wannabusser at heart) two hours later our buts were as sore in
all the same places as they would have been had we taken my beloved
'Roadwarrior'....

So now I move up my project to rework a bus seat with a marriage to Golf
&amp; Jetta components before setting off for Manassas....I'll make it
comfortable if it kills me !!

Good bussing all....Den...
