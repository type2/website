&gt; I don't get it. My 71 Westy shifts through the gears just fine - as long as

&gt; reverse but a grind is very audible. When I do find a gear and get it

A further thought: You might be able to tell if it is the needle bearing
by listening for a dry rasping sound when the engine is running, you're
in neutral, and you press down on the clutch pedal. It is then that the
needle bearing comes into play. Sounds similar to a bad throwout
bearing, but more rumbly, if I recall.  It's been a while since I've
seen this problem.  It's rare. I hope it's not what it is.
