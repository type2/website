Subject: RE: [T2] door panel removal '79

Andy,
lift the door release lever, as if you were opening the door.  Look toward
where the lever hinges.  There should be a small gap that you can put a
standard flat screwdriver into in order to 'pop' out that cheap plastic
plate that is covering the screw that you are looking for.  It is not
particularly resistant to popping out either.  Shouldn't take too much
persuasion.  When prying, take care not to apply so much force that you
break something that wasn't meant to come out that way.  Hope this is what
you were asking.
