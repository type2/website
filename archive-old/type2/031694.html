&gt; 5th injector is staying on all the time, that would do it.

the cold start valve staying on is more likely to cause a fire (ask me how
I know, and the value of a fire ext)

on a carbed engine a bad fuel pump diaphram is the most likely cause but
on a FI engine....
are all 4 cyl firing ?
there really is very little way for fuel to get into the crankcase
