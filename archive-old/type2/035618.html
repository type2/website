Subject: Re: List members webpage. :)

I must say that this is a cool site.  Maybe I'm just saying that because my bus
is on it, and a link to my site.  Well, probably.  But I'm going to link my site
to it.  It's way cool.

&gt;     From the over 6,000 list posts in my deleted folder I found some
&gt; homepages and pics of list members Bus's. I put them all on one page so we
&gt; can all see each others pride and joy. I know I missed a few (there has to
&gt; be more then the twenty or so I found..) and there are about three that I
&gt; couldnt get into the right formatt for some reason... If ANYONE has a pic of
&gt; them and thier bus send it in!
