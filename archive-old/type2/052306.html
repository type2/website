Subject: Re: [T2] Whatzit Week 4 - ANSWER ME THIS

&gt;thought they were silly.  They were never hooked to anything, but I assume
&gt;that's because they were hooked with cheap foil hose or something.  
&gt;I just want to know because one day someone's going to come to me with a 
&gt;question about those funny exhaust pipes on their bus, and I won't know
&gt;what to tell them.

I think it was just VW paranoia or constant improvement mentality
basically.  In '78 there are a bunch of sudden changes.  Westies
(and maybe all buses?) get an insulation mat underneath the gas
tank, they switch to steel fuel lines, they relocate the fuel pump
up onto the frame rail (this may be a mid '77 change,) they relocate
the charcoal canister off the firewall, and they add the said flapper
valves with cheapo foil hose down to those &quot;exhaust&quot; pipes.  Idea
obviously to reduce heat up around and under the tank.  I can see
this for about 3 possible reasons.

1. Safety, but I think this one is really the least likely as if they had
thought it was a real issue, VW still in the day would probably have
recalled and retrofit the parts on '72-'77 if they thought they had
a real safety iussue.

2. FI related, like to avoid or forstall hot start problems involving vapor
lock in the lines.  They've never had this problem as I can tell, but with
a weak fuel pump or leaky pressure regulator you can begin to get
symptoms.  Plus they were having it in the same years with the first
K-jet Scirocco systems and may have just thought it was a good update.

3. Longetivity.  This ties into the last, get the heat away from the
flexible pieces of hose left in the fuel ring (on and off the tank) and
away from the starter etc.

About all that occurs to me.  Like I sort of indicated they abandoned
the thought for the first vanagons, and I doubt ever had flapper valves
to replace them, so...  When I got free exchangers for the '78 5? years
ago in the LeCoz deal I made a point about asking if I would get the
correct flappers, and they could not do it.  So I took what they gave
me, a clear indication VWoA wasn't very concerned about keeping the
system as stock.  The 30+ year VW mechanic that came to install
my parts had no clue what the stuff was for.
