&gt; 2. The notch on my dizzy (009) is NOT lined up with the 1st cylinder firing

Doesn't appear to be a problem if everything is running OK.  Sounds like 
the distributor drive shaft is off its &quot;correct&quot; position by several 
teeth.  Ordinarily having the drive shaft off so far IS a problem because 
you can't rotate the stock distributor enough to compensate.  

Turn the engine over until #1 is at TDC.  Remove the distributor and look 
down the hole.  The groove in the top of the drive shaft should be at 
about a 12 degree angle with the centerline of the engine, with the 
offset toward the oil cooler.  Your's probably isn't.  Get a manual 
(Haynes is fine) and at some point you can fix this.

&gt; 3. There are no flaps or a thermosat (see #1)]

Opinions vary, but most folks will say you should have both, even in 
Florida.  Time for some junkyard scrounging.


&gt; 4. I don't think I have and EGR valve (what the heck is it supposed to look
&gt; like?)

The EGR valve is a squarish, silverish box (maybe 3&quot; x 2&quot; x 1.5&quot;) with a 
short arm sticking out of it.  It's attached to the left front (FIF) of 
the air distribution box and the arm is attached to a rod that moves with 
movement of the throttle plate.  Given what's happened to that van, you 
probably don't have one.  Get that manual.

&gt; 6.  My spark plugs have dry black deposits on them... what would cause that?

Usually a too-rich mixture.


&gt; 7. I have a mystery valve/vaccume thing at the front left of my
&gt; compartment... on end (with rubber hose) is plugged with a screw, the other
&gt; (metal one) is not attached to anything.

If it's a big round brass thingy mounted on the engine campartment's 
sheet metel then its the decel valve, if it's a smaller brass round 
thingy attatched to the cooling tin then it's the pressure regulator.  
Get that manual.
