&gt; Does anyone who if that is what this Bus Depot part is?

&gt; It doesn't really look like the photo of the seal in the Bentley manual
&gt; (the one that sits between the clamp and the case), but I can't compare
&gt; it to the one that came off my distributor, since mine is in maybe 8
&gt; pieces (gee, wonder how long that seal has been leaking...)

That exploded picture is misleading. The seal obviously goes on the body in
the groove. That seal gets hard and brittle over time.
