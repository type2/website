&gt; I seem to remember Greg saying he had done something tricky with the tank.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&quot;The fuel tank now has a splitter that will accommodate the fuel return line.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; This may be the reason for high fuel pressure. If it is a tee type situation
&gt; with only one branch into the tank, it can't work as a return line, as the
&gt; fuel will be trying to flow in both directions at once.

The tee worked in my Bus  .....  74 tank one outlet ,, tee'd into a 3/8&quot; lines ,,one
is to the pump, one is from the regulator

let's hope Greg took some pics! &lt;wink&gt;

Here is what I plan to put in my tank one day
