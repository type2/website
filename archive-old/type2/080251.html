Subject: Synthetic oil vs. Regular

Hi all,
Just another data point in the synthetic vs. regular oil department.  I =
have been running Mobil 1 15W-50 for many months now in my '79 Bus.  My =
engine did not develop any leaks.  My engine doesn't leak anyway except =
for a little seepage from the sump plate.  I'm completely convinced that =
synthetic oil is much much better than regular oil.  I really like the =
extra high temperature protection that synthetic offers (especially in =
an air-cooled engine) and I also like the easier cold starting.  Also my =
lifters seem to pump up faster if the car's been sitting for a while :-)

When I put synthetic in the engine did seem a little smoother, =
especially at high rpms.  Can't say I noticed much of a mileage change.  =
Seems to run a little cooler in the summer, running cooler is not an =
issue in the winter :-)

If your Bus leaks oil like a sieve or burns a lot of oil I wouldn't =
recommend it just because it's so expensive.  I'd recommend you fix the =
oil leakage/usage problems and then go to synthetic.    For a Type 4 =
engine it's good since the Type 4 has an oil filter.  I don't think I'd =
recommend it for a Type 1 not because synthetic is bad but because the =
Type 1 has no oil filter so you have to change the oil quite often no =
matter what kind it is.  Since synthetic is so expensive, it could be =
pricey to keep your Type 1 in synthetic oil.

Now that the engine in my Passat is thoroughly broken in, I'm going to =
switch to synthetic in that one on my next oil change as well. =20

Did you know that according to the owner's manual for my '79 Bus, the =
oil change interval is 7500 miles?  And also that you are only supposed =
to change the oil filter every other oil change at every 15,000 miles?  =
I wouldn't leave regular oil in there for 7500 miles and I don't leave =
synthetic in there that long either but I think 5000 miles is a good =
number.  I might try going to 7500 with synthetic if the Bus was my =
daily driver and I was putting a lot of miles on it in a relatively =
short time, but as it is now I am driving the Bus at a rate to be less =
than 5000 miles per year.  Yes, I change the filter every time too :-) =
-- but hey, if you buy a late Bus and it only had oil changes every 7500 =
miles and filter changes every 15,000 miles, it's still maintained to =
factory spec :-)
