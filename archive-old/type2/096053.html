&gt;I went with a portable fridge (RC3000) made by dometic.  it is a green
&gt;box that comes with a set of wheels if you wish to use them as well as
&gt;110v 12v and lp hookups. [...] I have a small power inverter in the
&gt;van so when moving i use the 110 volt connection and when camped
&gt;switch to gas.

You'll get better overall efficiency if you run the fridge on 12 V while
moving.  All the fridge is doing is burning up the power in an electric
heater, so there's no sense in losing some of the power in the 12 V -&gt; 
120 V inverter beforehand.  I have a little 300 W inverter here and it's
fused at 35 A.  If you assume it will pull 30 A _at_ 13.8 V at full load,
you're spending 414 watts to get 300 watts, or 72% efficiency.  If you
want to assume it will pull the full 35 A _at_ 13.8 V at full load, you're
up to 483 watts or 62% efficiency.  Running a refrigerator on this
inverter continuously for an hour would waste at least 0.048 gallons
of gasoline, or just under a mile of traveling at 20 mpg.

Again, http://www.tinaja_dot_com/glib/energfun.pdf is recommended.
