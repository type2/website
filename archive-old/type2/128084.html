Subject: Re: [T2] 1 of 2 dual carbs whining at me bad

ok great struggle to find the problem here and after a nice supper some fried chik N and mash taters and gravy wooo weeeee i had my head right and went back out and think i got her fixed... hehehehe
anyhow after readjusting the mix to engine start 2 1/2 out from closed and once the choke was warm again i began to check the balance and idle between the 2 carbs and setting them up at around 850-950 rpm's..
once set up and the engine was warm i began to turn carb #1 left side facing engine about 1 1/2 turns.... till the engine began to drop in idle as i checked the dwell meter to assure its drop this time before i had been earing it.
then once dropped i turned back out half turn...
next carb right side i turned in about half to full turn before it cut back and then back out half turn..
checked the synch between the two again.... was good still ;;;
was careful and hooked up linkage not to rev up the motor ... it stayed the same(idle)
checked the rpm's reved up on both to about 3000 rpm's and got the same reading on the synch for both...
wooopeee took around the block and down the road and seems i have my daily driver back or am hoping so... she drove really good..
seems though there is a loss of power from, that i had with the weber.progressive.? start offs and such...
she deffinetly had a loose manifold and gasket... feels good when you mash the gas pedal now not like she wants to flood out instead of drive..
thanks all that helped i hope that she continues to be good i look for the linkage to give me a fit though since it seems it is the wrong linkage they sent me....
made it work though... nothing a little copper tubing couldnt fix ...(grins)
peace
chris
