&gt; My MAF has been sitting on the shelf too long... 
&gt; what I thought would be a few

&gt; I known, I would have

&gt; sensor has accumulated a coat 
&gt; of dust and a few cobwebs.  Someone on this list,
&gt; IIRC, wrote about cleaning, 
&gt; maybe with Tuner Spray??  Any thoughts will be

Glenn, what beast, specifically are we talking about?
It makes a huge difference and I know nothing about
your ride...Happy to help otherwise. -BaH
