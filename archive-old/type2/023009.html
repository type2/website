&gt;The biggest problems I've run into are what to set the

&gt;half hour or more of 55 mph driving on a hot summer
&gt;day.

Here's a loaded question.  Why is HIOP such a big deal?  Can anyone provide 
references to cases where low oil pressure at idle caused premature engine 
failure?

My own opinion is that it doesn't matter.  The engine is under almost zero 
load at idle and as long as the bearings don't dry up, they will remain 
lubricated.  It doesn't take much pressure to keep this small amount of oil 
in the bearings at 900rpm.  Full throttle, 3000rpm is different of course, 
and if your oil pressure is low under that condition, I wouldn't be 
suprised to see engine damage.

My bus has seen about 140,000 miles and three different engines, none of 
which ever had &quot;good&quot; HIOP and none of which failed while idling.
