OK, I think your missing it, and considering how many folks missed it I
must have done a pretty poor job of describing the situation.

78 auto tranny, stock 2L engine.

. I put in a gas heater,
. my heater ducts were shot so removed the ENTIRE heat system from the
front Y conector back, 
. blanked off the blower slots on the bottom of the fan housing
. removed the blower in the engine compartment
. plugged the holes in the tin from the aux blower 
. removed the heater boxes, made J tubes
. removed the very bottom tin, that attaches to the heater boxes to direct
the cooling air out the back and also over the thermostat.

I disconected the thermostat (all flaps and tin is intact) because I was
worried that without the tin to contain the engine cooling air that it
might &quot;Stay in cool position&quot; and cause the engine to overheat.


Was looking at the idea of making a piece of tin to go above the exhaust
(J tube) pipe but below the pushrod tubes to contain the air from the
cooling system so that. 1. it would exit out the rear 2. would blow the
air over the thermostat so that it would help the engine warm up faster in
the winter.

has anyone else done this, am I missing something???

I hope this is clear!?!?!?!?
