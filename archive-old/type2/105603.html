Subject: Think it's time for a new front beam?

I made quite a dent in the beam today when I did the screwdriver test 
on the beam in my 71 westy.

&gt; http://wave.prohosting_dot_com/~mrturco/beam/beam.html

I had stopped driving this bus last summer, and a year ago I guess I 
didn't poke hard enough where I saw the rust.  Once I made a small 
puncture today, all hell broke loose.  I could have done more, but 
decided to take pics.  This is scary stuff to me, as I knew it was 
rusty, and checked periodically on it.  The other side is solid, and 
every indication in the front end was that everything was fine.  Tight 
steering, and great brakes, no wandering around the road.  I almost put 
it up for sale a couple of months ago, and thankfully I didn't so a 
possible catastrophe was avoided for an unknowing new owner.  I'm sure 
I'll be posting on my progress of getting this poor thing out, and 
getting another one in.  Wow.
