Subject: Wiring looms

All:

        Ras Bulli Split's licence plate light now works :)  I ended up
replacing the wire to it and running an additional ground to the
chassis [it would appear that grounding to the engine compartment
hatch wasn't sufficient...don't know what that says about he condition
of the hinges and striker...I guess that they do not conduct
electricity ;)]

However, I have decided that the wiring loom must go...that it should
be replaced; the last 30 years have left it looking like a patchwork
quilt.  The only catalogue I have that lists wiring looms is an old
['92] WCM parts book and they wanted over $300 for a complete wiring
loom.  That seems just a little extravagant!

Does anyone know of another source for a wiring loom?  It is starting
to look as though I will be building my own [which I would think I can
do for well under $300].  I would like to keep the wiring as close to
stock as possible, however a cursory visit to the local FLAPS only
yielded wire in the colours [red, green, white, blue, black,
yellow, and brown].  Does anyone know of a source where I could obtain
wire with the necessary markings [red stripes on grey for tail lights,
etc] or something very close?  As you still find wiring that is
marked in this manner in new vehicles, I assume that someone makes it.

Also, does someone have a conversion table to match metric wiring
specs [i.e. diameter of wire core in mm] to the appropriate gauge?

Bugs &amp; Thing &amp; Splits...Oh, my!

Roy
