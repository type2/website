&gt; OK here is the run down on what  is going on with my 77 2L FI bus.

when does it backfire???  acceleration, backoff, idle

if at throttle backoff I would suspect the .009 dizzy, the guy setting
your timing probably set it too far (advanced) to be able to get enough
advance out of it...try to find the correct vacuum dizzy if possible.

the timing might check &quot;dead on&quot; at idle or some RPM but I would be very
surprised if it stayed &quot;Dead on&quot; at all rpm ranges
