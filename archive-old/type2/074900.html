Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question

Its more expensive to run a farm than a Volkswagon so I don't have any
actual savings,,,,,,,, just Oil and Gas royalites on unused land and a
house that chickens would not live in. 
I park my AirSream trailer there about five tines a year an trim brush,
burn trash and watch birds.

&gt; &gt; I register the Westy at my farm, 120 miles from Dallas TX.
&gt; &gt; I get about 65% insurance discount and no tailpipe inspections.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I wish I were so lucky. I am in the opposite situation.  We live in 
&gt; a rural
&gt; area of Pennsylvania, among lots of farms and only a few modern
&gt; &quot;neighborhoods&quot; so far. Our nearest cities are smaller ones (Reading 
&gt; and
&gt; Allentown), where insurance is cheap and there is no emissions 
&gt; testing. But
&gt; despite our close proximity to those cities, we are (by 2 miles) 
&gt; within
&gt; Montgomery County, a large county that extends all the way to the 
&gt; border of
&gt; Philadelphia an hour away.  Because our county borders on 
&gt; Philadelphia, the
&gt; state considers us to be in suburban Philadelphia, despite the fact 
&gt; that we
&gt; are nowhere near it. So I pay twice as much for insurance as I would 
&gt; if I
&gt; lived 2 miles up the road, and have to pass rather stringent 
&gt; emissions tests
&gt; each year. :-(
