Subject: The Guac goes to California, v2.0 - Orange, CA

I made it!

I'm sitting in a Starbucks right now enjoying a Mocha Frap and checking my
email before I go to my mom's and lose all privacy for the next month. ;-)

No problems with the Guac other than the little exhaust leak getting much
bigger. And hitting 90 on the down side of Cajon Pass (!). I was
concentrating on the road and didn't notice the speed creeping up. Oops. At
least it was the downside so little or no thermal load.

I have no idea how hot the Mojave Desert was, but it was HOT. I mean
HOTHOTHOT! We stopped for gas and the wind was burning my skin. HOT! Felt
like 120. Scary. I want winter back. I hate hot. It's so much easier to
throw a jacket on than to deal with heat. To make things worse, I-40 in AZ
had bunches of construction knocking the highway down to one lane in two
separate places. Bridge work it seems. Grrr... Took over an hour to go 10
miles. In the brutal heat. Bastages!

The entire trip, I saw 6 busses, 5 of 'em bays:

In Green Valley, CO (right before getting on I-25) an orange Westy.
Somewhere in NM, a house with a bunch of junk cars had a white Westy,
stripped.
A black with white hardtop driving down the street in Albuquerque as I was
leaving the motel.
A faded blue Westy passed me going East on I-40 in NM after leaving
Albuquerque.
Another faded blue Westy (twins?) also going East, but in Arizona.
In AZ there was a yellow split as part of a junkyard sign right off I-40 in
AZ.
