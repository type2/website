Subject: Re: [T2] brake fluid filler to reservoir hose

&lt;&lt; Hiya Brian,

I had to replace this hose a while back.  When I went to look for a 
replacement I got shrugs mostly.  &quot;Sorry, no longer available.&quot;  I finally 
wound up 
going to a hydraulics shop and finding a hose to fit.  By the way, it was 
such a 
good fit that I was able to dispense with those miserable little rubber 
sleeves on the reservoir and filler container.

Has anyone out there, considered or used aftermarket fuel lines such
as Earl's or Aeroquip to &quot;do-it-once&quot; and forget it...My Bus is carbed
so the installation wouldn't need the high pressure FI lines...
