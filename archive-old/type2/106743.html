Subject: Re: [T2] RE: no brake lights

&gt; Agreed on the bleeding tip. Definately do it! As for the switches they
&gt; usually run on the ground side but I could be wrong here...

I dont think so.
Following the madness of the current track diagram....
(hate is not too strong of a word here)
Power is supplied from the ignition switch terminal 15
via black wire through a terminal S11/12 splits to 2 black wires
on to the brake switches terminal 82a which will be always hot.
when you activate the brakes terminal 81 and 82a will be connected which
will supp;y the 12v to the brake lights M9 and M10 through a red/black
wire. the brake lights ground to the fixture which is grounded to
the body.

Hope that helps  you figure it out.
