Subject: Gas Leak!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all!

Well, the green machine has been hibernating for quite
some time at this point.  I went out to the garage
this afternoon for the first time in about a week and
found something quite suprising.

There was a pretty desent puddle of gas under the bus
and running towards the garage door.  I looked and
noticed that the gas puddle started about even to the
front of the rear tires and lays about dead center
widthwise.  

I have since siphoned most of the gas out of the tank
and covered what gas had spilled with kitty litter to
be swept up in a day or so.  My guess is the filler
tube is bad, but I am open to any other opinions.  If
it is the filler tube, what does it take to fix?  I
have a habit of replacing all of the fuel lines every
year, but I have never touched the filler tube.

Just before she was put to bed for the winter my dad
went and filled the gas tank.  I asked him if he tried
to squeeze every last bit of gas into the tank humanly
possible.  His answer was that he had tried to fill
the tank past the original stopping of the pump. 
Could this possibly just be spillover kicked out from
being filled to excess?  It does seem that the gas
only leaked to a point then stopped.

Any help is always appreciated!
