Subject: Re: [T2] Help w/ my '78...

&gt; Did you adjust your valves?  Even though they're hydraulic, you still
&gt; need to adjust them.  If you haven't already, you will want to adjust
&gt; them 1.5 turns past contact for each set of valves.
&gt;

If the engine hasn't been running, set them just to touch. They've
probably bled off and need to pump up again. After running the engine
for 30 minutes or so you can go back and do the 1 1/2 turns like you
should.

Assuming hydraulics, of course.
