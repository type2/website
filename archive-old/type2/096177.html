&gt; Just wanted to let everyone know that my Bus ran great during the

&gt; of the advice from the list it ran cooler then going down the road at
&gt; 60mph.  I didn't have to use my clutch too much so that also did not

great I was thinking about you in the heat, glad you didn't have the same
results I did and it worked out for you...forgot to mention before that
the parade I was in was almost all uphill (shallow grade) so I had to hold
it the whole way..or maybe mine was ready to crash anyway....in any case
glad it worked out for you
