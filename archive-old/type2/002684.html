 I have often had to improve on some of the chincy design work vw did. (I
expect to receive some flack from this last comment)...

contraire! I love upgrading my bus. During my upcoming repainting teardown,
I plan a conduit system (I work for an elec. eng.) from under dash to engine
with a terminal cabinet and terminal strips somewhere in the cabin for quick
easy metering of the vital circuits. All labeling and annotated of course. I
will use an old alarm panel cabinet for my terminal cabinet, locking door,
etc. etc.
