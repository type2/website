&gt; I have the fold down bed out of a '71 westy.  I have sold it to a list
&gt; member thousands of miles away.  I am willing to sell it to him for 
&gt; what it is worth minus the cost of the shipping, if that makes any 
&gt; sense.  What are these things going for at the swap meets?  I think I 
&gt; remember seeing repros somewhere in the $300 range.  This is original 
&gt; equipment that has been professionally recovered and comes with the 
&gt; engine compartment cushion to make the whole bed.  Thanks, Jim

I got a nice one at the junkyard for $10.  Minus cushion.
