Subject: Lacarra Steering wheels and Brackets....
Content-Disposition: inline

Just wondering if anyone on the list has tried a LaCarra steering wheel on a 71
bus? After looking at the selection offered by Bus Boys, I was thinking about
one of the wood gripped models. Two things came to mind. With the cost of the
wheel and the adapter hub being about $270, how well do they actually fit and
look? Like a well matched accessory  or a bastardized additon with gaps and
mismatches? The second thing is how is the drivability of one of these? From
what I understand, the wheel is about 15&quot; across. I've always found that my
oversize factory wheel is a good deal of overkill but it would be nice to hear
from someone who has actually done it. Hope none of this is too redundant. I did
try an archive search before posting and got no feedback.
   The other thing I was wondering is if anyone out there has any spare U
brackets for VDO gauges? I recently mounted 3 in the dash between the radio
cutout and the ashtray. Looks great but I can't find the hold down brackets.
P-mail me if ya got any you can part with.
Thanks,
Tim
