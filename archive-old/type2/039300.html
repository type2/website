Subject: Re: New wood paneling?

Derrick,
My wife regularly makes crafts with some stuff called Baltic Birch plywood.  It
looks just like the stuff that covers the inside of my 72 Campmobile.  It comes
in different thickness.  She always gets 1/4 inch.  The weird thing is that it
comes in 5' x 5' sheets.
So far we have been able to order it from our local Meeks lumber yard and one
other specialty wood place.  If you can't find it, try checking the back of some
craft magazines for advertisements.

&gt;   I went to the local lumber yards looking for the thin birch
&gt;  paneling for the sides and the ceiling panels.  They didnt have anything
&gt;  that came close to the thickness I need.
&gt;
&gt;  Any help is alway appreciated!
