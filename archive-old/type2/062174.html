&gt;What high-tech gadget does the in-your-face, on-your-bumper, kind
&gt;of driver buy to keep his/her bad habits off of his permanent
&gt;record?  The fuzz buster.  That marvel of widgets and gizzmos
&gt;designed to allow for juvenile behavior behind the wheel without
&gt;annoying ramifications from the local constabulary.

&gt;Browsing through a mail order catalog...........

Recently, I found a website dedicated to a &quot;game&quot; (I can't remember what
they called it- something like &quot;Tail Light Bingo&quot;) of trying to set off the
radar detectors of the BMW-drivin'
yuppie scum... I think they mentioned using a smoke alarm to do it.
