Subject: Re: [T2] After 58 Years, the Beetle Gets to the End of the Road

Ok its Friday:


&gt;
&gt;The design was commissioned by Hitler, who instructed his engineer,
&gt;Ferdinand Porsche, that the car &quot;should look like a beetle.&quot;

Did he say that? That seems like rubbish to me. He wanted a car that could 
appeal to the masses, wouldnt overheat, or freeze, got high mileage, and was 
affordable.

As far as looks go, if you look at any 1930's era car its about the same 
only smaller.

I saw this on the news, and then read it here, and I just have to say, FIRE 
that reporter.

If I am wrong I will eat me words.

Um what do digital bits taste like? I guess I want a byte.
