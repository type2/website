I haven't been interested in the new (pre-Euro) vans, so I haven't 
looked at them. Today I got my chance to look at one for the first time. 
I really like the looks of the interior in the Westfalia.

On the older busses, the interiors look sort of like standard conversion 
vans, or like the interior of a trailer. This isn't bad, and the older 
Westfalias used high quality materials. I was just really impressed by 
this newer van. The interior looked sort of like the interior in an 
aircraft, with rounded corners, and everything tucked neatly away. It 
was quite nice.
