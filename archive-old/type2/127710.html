Subject: Re: [T2] How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

Being new to aircooled VWs and having an oil temp gauge in my '78 Westy, this
was one of the things I've been trying to find an answer to with no great
success, at least in getting a consistent answer.  ;)

I've come across a couple of people so far that have run at/around 250F
multiple times throughout their engine's hundred-thousand-plus-mile lifetime
and haven't had a problem.  They also said VW putting an oil temp gauge in was
a bad idea, it gave people something to look at and worry about.  ;)

So, on my '78 I've discovered a couple of things.  First, someone took out the
thermostat and flaps.

Second, at one time the two Racimex oil coolers mounted under the Westy were
hooked up but were disconnected and plugged before it was in my posession. 
Why?  Who knows.

Third, the time of day I drive the Westy affects my oil temp.  ;)  Going to
work from home is a pretty continuous grade for 15 miles or so, going from
about 4400ft up to 5300ft.  If I drive it in the morning the oil temp stays
just slightly above 210F.  If I do it in the afternoon with ambient temps
around 85-90F, and depending on traffic and lights, I'll see 240-250F by the
time I reach the peak of the climb.  It's never hinted at having any problems
at those temps, but from what the majority of people have said, it's a bad
place to be.  It's never wanted to go higher than 250F and it wasn't being
driven hard, just uphill for a good 20 mins.

Has anyone else seen 240-250F on a regular basis in &quot;hot&quot; weather?  What
adverse effects will not having the flaps have?  I don't want to kill the
engine prematurely, but in reality, how bad is 250F on at TypeIV engine? 
Looking at oil tests and standards, they test viscosity and shear at 150C
which is just over 300F.  If the oils don't hold their viscosities and shear
strength at that temp they fail.

So, the real question, to me, is not if 205F is too hot for the oil, but is it
too hot for the internals?  Would a failure be caused by the temps alone or
due to oil breakdown?

So much to learn still...  :)

&gt; Bah - I don't believe that, at least not with synthetic oil.
&gt; I've seen 250 degrees in my bus more times than I can remember with 
&gt; no ill effects.  I currently have 107,000 facts (miles) an counting 
&gt; to base my opinion upon. Also, I've seen well over 300 degrees in my 
&gt; *ahem* other vehicle while on the track (road course, not drag strip)
&gt;  with no ill effects.  It's water-cooled, though.
