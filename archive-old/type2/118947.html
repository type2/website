Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild vs. LongBlock

&gt; and of course with the type I engine you can get a nice Mexican engine
&gt; with some more modern upgrades such as hyd lifters. and it is 0 mile
&gt; engine from the git go.

and where would I go if I wanted to find out more about the above Mexican
engines. Are they buried in the ads of the mags I always try and sneak into
the cart when I'm at the store with my wife?
