Subject: Horn wire question

Hi, folks. I'm new to this list, having recently purchased a 72 Bus. Got to
know it better by driving it from San Francisco to Dallas (its new home).
What a wonderful vehicle! It's in beautiful shape, all original (except for
slightly modified engine). Very little work needs to be done.

Here's one thing that needs to be done. The horn, when plugged in, won't
stop blaring. After spending some time chasing this down, I've determined
the wire that runs down the steering column is the culprit. Now here's the
question: The wire goes down the middle of the steering column at the top.
However, I see no wire come out down at the bottom, at least through the
steering column. I do, however, see a wire on a spade connector come off
the bottom of the steering column tube (outer tube). This is shown in the
various manuals as being correct. My question is, where does the wire come
out from the center of the steering column shaft and start going through
the steering column tube? I want to replace this wire, but this is not
looking like a straightforward proposition. Can anyone &quot;steer me right&quot;?

Jerry
