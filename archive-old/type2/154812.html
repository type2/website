Subject: Cool Stuff arrived...

I just got two very cool items last week.

 

The first is my 3rd door seal for 68-71 (U.S.) Double Cab Pickups. It is
made by Paruzzi in Holland. OK quality, but the corners might need to be
re-glued.

I have one extra that is still available, one is going to Frank.

 

The other is a 1970 only master cylinder that has BOTH brake light sensor
pickups. These are being sold by Wolfsburg West (and hopefully by others). I
haven't seen them offered before. Only the one-sensor-pickup master cylinder
has been currently offered. It is nice to have a reproduction which sticks
to the original design; even though it can be argued that it doesn't need
it.
