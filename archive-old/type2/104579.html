&gt; A carb air cleaner question...
&gt; 
&gt; The single carb air cleaner on my bus's engine has a square base and top.
&gt; It's about 4&quot; x 7&quot;, and has a square air filter (hollow) with one corner at
&gt; a small 45 degree angle.  Four metal clips hold the top, to the bottom of
&gt; the air cleaner  I'm assuming that it's an aftermarket air cleaner, and so
&gt; it follows that I can't seem to locate a replacement filter for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone recognize this type of air cleaner, and would the opinion be
&gt; that it would be better to replace it with whatever was supposed to be there
&gt; in the first place, or that I should keep trying to find the right filter?
&gt; My next two stops were going to be a NAPA, then a performance shop.

This is a common filter for aftermarket carbs. If your 77 bus has a carb
there is no &quot;correct&quot; air filter, since your induction system is not stock.
That style of filter is used on many applications both for downdraft and
sidedraft carbies, webers mostly.

The best place to get elements for that style of filter would be at an
aftermarket performance parts shop. Try asking for an element for a weber
DGV or similar carb. You can get a K&amp;N element that you never have to
replace, you just clean and re-oil it.
