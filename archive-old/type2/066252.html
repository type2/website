Subject: Made By Hand tape... still circulating?

        Friends,
        Some months ago, many months probably, I sent a copy of a tape
I had of the 1961 Porsche promotional movie &quot;Made By Hand&quot; to someone who
was doing a window install, since the tape shows the factory technique
with string and a well judged push. I encouraged the recipient of the
loaned tape to forward it to the next person who wanted to see it,
and they to forward it, etc.
        So I'm curious now if the tape is still circulating or if
it came to rest somewhere. If it stopped moving, I'd like to get it back.
If it stopped moving but someone else would like to see it, it should
go to them and keep on moving.
        I realize sending a tape out to be circulated among persons
unknown is at the outer limit of groovyness, but seemed like a good
idea at the time and I'm curious if it was.
        The split of the list complicates matters, so I'm cross-posting
to both. 
        Its a VHS cassette with a copy of &quot;Nikki Lauda Explains Formula One
Racing&quot; as the second feature... a nice tape for a car-head evening :)
I think I put my address on the cassette and the box...

        Cheers!
