I had a look at my parts book last night (this is the one like the
microfiche but without the part numbers).  It has a page with a picture of
two non-FI tanks, one with the sloping top with a hose coming off with an in
line filter, the other with a flat top and no filter.  Then again, on the
page showing the rest of the fuel system (carbs, hoses and pump), it shows
the tank with a dashed outline and a hose going to it, but no filter.  I
don't know if the flat topped tank is for the pickup or if it's just an
early version, but could it be that VW started putting filters on at the
same time as they changed the tank, maybe 1972-3?  Does anyone know if the
tank capacity increased at any time?

&gt; I don't think that VW put any inline filters in buses, at least not
&gt; until fuel injection.  I think that the filter you are referring to is
&gt; an add-on.  Someone will correct me if I'm wrong!
