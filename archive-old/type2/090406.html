Subject: Re: [T2] 185/195 Size question- 205's continued

&gt; I have a complete set of what may be the last
&gt; batch of MXTs but I thought
&gt; the Aglis 61? were comparable.  

Not available in 205/70/14, at least not in this
country.  I'm not sure about internationally.   
 
&gt; yeah mine are rated load index of 99S, think
&gt; the weight rating is 1980 or
&gt; so....but they still only run ?43psi??  (from
&gt; memory)
&gt; 
&gt; no tire sag and I'm probably loaded pretty
&gt; close to the limit.  great
&gt; tires but not cheap
&gt; 
No quibbling over those numbers.  99 is a stout
tire.

Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Bus Captain
