Subject: Vacuum Cutoff

I have a 72 westy, which had the stock distributor.  Engine ran wrong,
all symptoms pointed to dist.  I put an 009 on and problems solved.

I am about to do atop end rebuild, I'm hopping to put the stock dizzy
back on.  However, I was looking at the wiring for the vacuum cutoff and
saw it was fried.  Possible problem from before.  Didn't know what it
was before.  Now I know what it is.

I found some talk of it in the archives and Bentleys, enough to describe
it's purpose only.

But what is it's significance.  Can I hook up the vacuum line from the
carb directly to the dist?  Or does this vacuum cutoff have a
significant function, meaning I need to repair the short and verify all
it's functionality?

Thanks
Brent
