Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

&gt;&gt;We should constantly remind ourselves that these are old vehicles with a
&gt;&gt;limited parts demand.  We rely on small(er) suppliers to fill our needs.
&gt;
Ironically, because I saw the post about the childs cot order, I am going to 
order one myself!

Seems like a good price to me! Wait a minute could I order one made of hemp?
