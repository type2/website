Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic: Dashboard

I still think that the way to go is to do a really radical modification 
by putting a Vanagon emergency brake lever on the floor next to the 
driver's seat (walkthroughs only) and then to build a console for 
gauges, stereo, GPS, storage, and a pop-out cup holder like I have in 
my VW GTI (but below the radio, not above it -- ask me why).

David, weren't those gauges on top of Bluto's dash before?

(That Bus Depot parcel tray is now on my must-have list, Ron.)
