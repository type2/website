Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt;Has anyone found a good source for an aftermarket wheel that fits a '71
and
later Baywindow bus?

Here is My 1971 with 15X6 rims with 215x55x15 on them

You can go all the way up to a 16 in rim and still keep the tire
rotation almost similar to the original 185X75X14 by choosing a tire and
rim set up like 16x7 rim with a tire of 205x50x16. The reason you can
use a bigger tires is because the rear tire well is flanged out. For a
good example look at my husbands bus.

It has 16 in rims on it and he has no turning problems, plus his bus
drives so much better now as more tire on the road keeps him stable
(also a good tension bar helps). He is planning on slamming his bus like
mine is and doesn't expect to encounter any problems with turning as
long as the keeps at least 1 1/2 in clearance over the front wheel.

Also if you want to see what your speed difference is with different
size rims and tires on would be, go here :

Hope that helps.
