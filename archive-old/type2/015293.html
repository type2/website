How about the current hot VWs and dune buggies issue? The NorthEAST corner
column has a story about a &quot;kub&quot; going driving in the Pacific Northwest!
Hehe. A few other typos too, nothing worth really mentioning though.
And.
Did anyone happen to catch the ad that ran about a year or two ago about
the early model Red Karmann Ghia model? The name of the company escapes me
but it was full page ad for a &quot;quality&quot; looking model, kind of like the ads
that run for the china plates and dolls. Well the description was going on
and on about the craftsmanship and detail, and how accurate it all was blah
blah &quot;right down to the radiator cap&quot;. I laughed so hard I showed everyone
in my family. Even they know something about the no-radiator factor with
early VWs.
Anyhow. Have a good weekend.
