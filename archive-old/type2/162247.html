&gt;Do not buy those injectors from the FLAPS.  They will not be the same.  I

This FLAPS is not an AdvanceAuto/O'Reilly/AutoZone place. They specialize
in import parts. I get my Mann oil filters and other German parts there
too. I also have a 944S. He told me the new injectors are Bosch. Are you
saying that even new Bosch injectors are not going to be the same? He had
the same part number I had (0280150114).

&gt;Why not get a used set and have them rebuilt, or if your car is down, send
&gt;them off for a rebuild?  I have a rebuilt set from a FI place i will sell
&gt;you exchange, right now.........I kept them on the shelf for a rainy day.

He can get rebuilt ones for $44. I have heard (read in the archives) that
you can't really thoroughly clean/rebuild injectors because of some of
the internal parts.
