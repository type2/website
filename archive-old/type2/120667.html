Subject: Thanks!

I would like to thank everybody that gave me
suggestions on where to find my NLA valve.  I have
located one and am also considering doing a rear disk
swap.  Locating information though is tricky.  I found
nothing in the library and limited info in the
archives. (mostly talk, no tech)
Any info I have located so far is from conversions
done on Mustangs and GTI's.  So wish me luck.
-Dawn
