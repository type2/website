 I wouldn't put it under the bus, a
&gt;heater is too nice of a tool not to keep it inside.
&gt;
&gt;Then buy a relay and put a thermostat on it!!  Nice and toasty all night at
&gt;what ever temp you set it at.
&gt;

Man, I don't know.  I'd be very careful about any furnace producing toxic
fumes inside a bus I was sleeping in.  People hardly ever die of the cold,
and good sleeping bags are cheap.
