Subject: Re: [T2] Engine races when brakes applied



&gt; Hello and Happy Monday:
&gt; 
&gt; I finally got my new engine installed into my 71 bus, and everything is going OK, but the one big problem I'd like to solve is that my 
engine races when I apply the brakes.

This one's easy.  You have a vacuum leak somewhere between the brake booster and the manifold.  Could be a bad booster or just a 
cracked hose.
