Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with the transmission

Csaba,

You need pictures so you can check everything from front to back.

http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/

Scroll down the left side of the page until you find &quot;shifter and Shift 
linkage  68-79 T2&quot;

Look at the pictures.

Then go here http://longenterprises_dot_com/diagram_folder/diagramlist.htm

and look at the shift linkages that are inside the nose-cone of the 
transmission.

http://longenterprises_dot_com/diagram_folder/diag13_irs_type2_002_housings.htm

There is a possibility that something could be broken inside the 
transmission, but most people usually have trouble with the shift rod 
someplace from front to back.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thans for the suggestionss

&gt; I went outside (there is about 1' snow out there) and lyed under the 
&gt; bus. The coupler - I found it :) - is OK. Looks fine. 
&gt; My wife moved the shifter aroung, and it just moves around, without 
&gt; finding a gear, only the third is what can be found, if you push it 
&gt; REALLY HARD. 
&gt;  
&gt; So what now? Should I dismantle the whole transmission system? Read on 
&gt; some page that there are some &quot;slots&quot; which can go &quot;mixed up&quot; and can 
&gt; cause a problem like this. But it is not clear to me where they are, 
&gt; and how to realign them?
