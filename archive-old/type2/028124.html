Hi, I was wondering if the clutch cross shaft should have any movement in it
before it contacts stuff inside the tranny housing. Mine moves about half an
inch at the end before meeting resistance, which I assume means the throwout
bearing meets the clutch pressure assembly or maybe the shaft meets the TO
bearing. This seems normal if you consider that the clutch pedal has spring
loaded freeplay. The thing is I don't remember being able to move it last
time I replaced a clutch cable. Has anyone noticed if you can rotate the
clutch cross shaft by hand 1/2 inch? What is going on down there.
