Subject: Engine questions

Hi All,

My neighbor down the street acquired a whole buttload (scientific term 
for many thousands of pounds and lots of volume) of VW parts.  Among 
them is a type4 engine.

It came off an automatic transmission, it is fuel injected (some of the 
system is still there), but I didn't get a good enough look at it to get 
an engine number.  I don't have a tranny/starter to put on it to check 
compression, so I'll have to resort to a wrench to make sure it turns 
over good (remove plugs first), and pull the valve covers to check that 
none of them are terribly messed up.  IE, dropped valve standing 1/4&quot; 
proud of the others, etc)

I offered him $150-200 for it.  That seems to be the running price 
around here for a condition-unknown type 4 engine.   Doesn't really 
matter, as when I acquire an engine it'll get stripped bare and rebuilt 
completely.

I'm pretty sure I have this right, but isn't the type4 engine case the 
same from 1800cc up to 2L?  Any specific engine code I should shy away 
from?  Any spot check I should perform to check for terrible engine 
damage quickly?

Thanks!

Shad H.
