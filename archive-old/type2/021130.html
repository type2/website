I prefer the scent of clorox fresh scent over febreeze.  Febreeze is
just to durned synthetically sweet...

I'd turn 'em upside down and liberally spray all over, keep the bottom
exposed to the sun, then repeat on the upside.

After a few days to fully air and perhaps repeat if it's not good enuf,
I'd put 'em in an enclosed space and nag champa the hell out of 'em.

OR, even better, blue pearl makes a golden champa that will make you
think heavenly thoughts, and it's STRONG.  Eh, eric_at_exoticincense has it
online...

Elevate the seat on something and put a dozen sticks of nag champa or
maybe 3-4 of the blue pearl golden champa underneath with plenty of
clearance.  That should fumigate and perfume them pretty well.

I regularly close up the bus tight and burn a stick of something.  For
the next week it's a treat to open the door.  ;-)
