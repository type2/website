Subject: RPM and Gas Mileage

Hello everybody,
   I have searched the library, and cant get the archives to work, so thought 
i would ask y'all. 
    I just installed a tachometer, and you could imagine my excitement. I 
know that my speedo is a bit off on the high side (the main benefit if those 
speed checkers that they have been putting on the side of the road), but 
figure i can find some sort of formula to figure RPM/speed ratio. What i'm 
wondering is peak gas mileage. I have heard that the VW engine gets best gas 
mileage  between 3,000 and 3,500. I think that this may be a little high. 
When i run at about 65 on the highway, my RPM's are about 3200, and i really 
dont go any faster than that. My normal shift point seems to be around 2900 
to 3100, and it seems weird to think that my engine's optimal range is higher 
than my shift point. 
  Anybody care to share your opinion on this?
Matt O.
