Subject: Re: [T2] Tape Deck for My 79

Honda's decks are (or were) produced by Alpine, and are excellent quality.  
Even the VW decks are made by Clarion and Panasonic.  The sound fidelity 
isn't the best, but they are reliably built.

The Honda
&gt;tape decks have always been good to me. I recently installed an-ex-Accord 
&gt;tape player on my Honda motorcycle to replace the analog manual tuning 
&gt;radio/tape deck. It's digital and has preset buttons so it is less likely 
&gt;to get me killed while trying to tune the radio to the next station. (also 
&gt;a lighted front).
&gt;
&gt;Value? $15 tops I'd guess. In my case the Honda named stereo on my Honda 
&gt;motorcycle works out well.
