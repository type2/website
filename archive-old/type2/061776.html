Subject: Rust preventative paint
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

What paint do you guy's (+ gal's) for rust prevention &amp; priming? I would
usually use &quot;waxy&quot; a thin  waxy (duh) fluid that never sets on the underside
or a undershield paint with this wax as an additional ingredient. This is
great where you can't see but what about where the body work is seen? Hare
in the UK we have POR15, any ideas?
