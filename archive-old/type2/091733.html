Cruise around the gowesty site and you will find that gowesty is the=20
webfront for a company that restores
  campers to useable condition.  I have bought from  gowesty and  gotten=20=

good parts and good delivery.

&lt;&lt;from their vehicle sales area&gt;&gt;
Looking to buy a Camper? GoWesty has complete
campers for sale too! We buy 1986 to 2002 vehicles
  or take them in trade (nothing seriously-wrecked or
rusty), fix 'em up, and offer them at roughly 10 percent
over cost plus the cost to fix them.=A0When we're done with
a vehicle you can count on it being an honestly-represented
camper at a fair price.
