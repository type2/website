Subject: '70 sink faucet

&gt; just cant get the faucet to pump the water from the tank....once
&gt;tank is filled though.. soooooooooooo hmmmmm i know its a basic
&gt;science but that was never my major lol....that is if the faucet
&gt;it'self works.. ?

Chris,

take the faucet apart.  IIRC there is a rubber O-ring that works on a
plunger to pull water via vacuum into the faucet chamber.  this needs to be
intact (if not go to hardware store) and greased with a little food-grade
silicone lube (ask at camping store for water purification pump parts).
there also needs to be a marble in there for a check valve. this is if I
remember correctly, I had to haul mine to a junkyard because of monster
rats.
