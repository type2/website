Subject: Rust and misc questions

  I am looking about buying a 66 camper but I have got a few
question I hope you guys could help me answer.
The only place that I noted bad rust was on the front floor pans.
2 or 3 golf ball size holes, any way the guy said he would give me
the 2 new floor pans he had so I could get that fixed.
There just seemed to be minimal rust any where else though.
So my first question is how could you have so much rust up front
but not anywhere else that bad? Also what are the key places
to look for rust?

One other thing I know nothing about is all this talk about
ball joints and boots. I looked on type2_dot_com for maybe some info
or a picture to help explain but was unsuccessful. A simple
explanation would be helpful since I am totally lost.

Also thanks to all the people who have helped me in the past.
This list is great!

Thanks
Alex,
