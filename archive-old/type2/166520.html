Subject: Re: Metal wall behind front seats

 &gt;My question is this:  Were those metal walls removable?

Only by cutting them out! :(

 &gt;If they are removable, is it possible to fit them to a post '77 bus?

I'm sure it could be done but you would have to be keen! You would 
also want to think long and hard about what are the priorities for 
work on your bus!
