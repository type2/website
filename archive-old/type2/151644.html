Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg 
  dipstick oil temp sensor

Arnaud,

My apologies...your engine looks great from pics.  

If you looked at the oil cooler a month ago and it was clean on the 
outside, then forget pulling the engine....just not necessary unless 
something has happened in the meantime.

Your heads and oil temps are doing the opposite than usual.._dot_usually head 
temps go up &quot;right now&quot; under load and oil temps go up shortly afterward.

Hmmm..a proper three pipe problem then!(Sherlock Holmes).

So, with heads running cold(or at least that is what the funky VDO stuff 
is telling you), the oil gets hot.

Arnaud, do you have access to one of those handheld laser thermometers?

Did you check end play when engine was out?

You said oil pressure was not a problem...when engine that hot and 
stopping for a light, the oil light does not flicker.  At that point, with 
stock idle speed, then you probably don't have a rod or main bearing 
problem....so this is definitely getting more interesting.

I wonder at this point if you have a parially clogged(inside) oil cooler, 
or maybe an oil pressure relief valve that is stuck????  Look at the oil path in 
the Bentley manual and see where it goes...I can't remember right now.

Are you getting full advance on the distributor at upper rpm's?  and you 
have absolutely verified that TDC on the pulley *is* really TDC?  That you 
don't have the wrong(non specific year model) pulley on there?...&lt;grin&gt; 
don't ask how I know!

Arnaud, I drove a 67 split all over Texas with a modified engine and never 
got that hot.  And that is with reduction gear boxes as well!

Do anything that you can to get rid of the air flow past where the hoover 
bit goes....duck tape, whatever....and then go for a drive.  Stick your
hand back there and make sure that it is stopped for the test.

Dumb question, but I have to ask....you do have the short exhaust 
deflector that goes thru the front breast plate from the oil cooler in 
place?...and no way for that hot air to get back into the engine 
compartment?....abd with the engine running(idling) you can feel lots of 
air coming out of it from underneath the bus??

No leaks from the carb preheat tube? I personally have BTDT.

Arnaud, I know you said you verified the berg stick, do you have a turkey 
thermometer though?  I have a digital one and used to come home and check 
my oil temps  with it as it was the perfect length and shape....just to be 
sure?

WUPS! just looked at your pics again....upper right hand side of fan 
shroud, old charcoal/air filter cannister type port out of the fanshroud
looses lots of nice cooling air out of there...plug it up!

Squeeze off the vacuum hose to the brakes....any change in engine idle 
speed?.....vacuum leaks down that pipe will make you run very lean(and 
hot).  When running hot, feel of the carb base....is it hot?

Still trying, dave

Lots snipped for brevity.

&gt; &gt; I am having trouble with the idea that your oil gets  hot, but your
&gt;  heads don't appear to be getting hot.
&gt; Many on the list believe that oil and head temp are not that correlated.

&gt; No this engine did not sit. I visually inspected oil cooler a month
&gt; ago when the engine was out. It was clean outside. Dunno how it looks
&gt; inside.

&gt; &gt; If I remember correctly, you already said that all engine sealing rubber
&gt;  was replaced.....???
&gt; Yes, (pic 2).
&gt; 
&gt; It is tight. No debris in the fan (except one of my fingers)
&gt; 
&gt; Nope. New brake lines, caliper changed as required, rear drums not
&gt; dragging. Heads would get hot if they were under load. Heads are cold.
&gt; 
&gt; No thermostat. Flaps and return spring working.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; New stock exhaust. Engine almost dies when I block it.
&gt;
