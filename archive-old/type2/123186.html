&gt; The initial cost of putting a bus on the road will pay off in the long run,
&gt; IF you do it right.

sometimes,  my first bus a 60 23 window deluxe I bought sight unseen for
$100 and drove it home and did nothing to it but oil and gas for several
years then sold it for $125  

then bought a 65 westy,  it was a disaster and I don't even want to know
how much I lost in that one

then bought a 71 plain jane bus NEW for I think $2100.00   put a little
over a 100k on it when it dropped a rod, don't recall doing anthing on
that but regular maintenence

have my 78 now for almost 12 years bought it for $2 but I'm sure by now I
have well over the mythical $5,000 in it.  but it still is my daily driver
and is not for sale....

so over the long run....it is about even I guess but wouldn't trade it for
any other piece of tin on the road.  and (knock on wood) I have had to
rescue my wife when her 99 s*turn failed 3 times, she only had to come get
me once, and it was a dead battery when I forgot to turn off the lights
