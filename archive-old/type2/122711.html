Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels???

Go to http://ww.tirerack_dot_com

Click on Products
Click on Tires
Click on Shop By Size

Set the top of the search section to 185/NONE/14
Do not select ANY other options on the search page
(I tried to select the speed range by clicking the top 4 speed boxes --
look closely and note that speed rating &quot;R&quot; is not there -- guess what
speed rating all the C/D load tires are)

Click GO

It brings up 5 tires. 4 of them are C or D rated and two of those are VERY
reasonably priced -- the others aren't bad. I can get a set of *6* Yokohama
Y-356-D tires delivered for $405.

Most local shops can get the same tires for about the same price if you
already know the brand/model to ask for.

Richard Palmer said something about [T2] 15&quot; wheels???:

&gt;  I know Mercedes wheels have been discussed as options for late models
&gt; &amp; vanagons (they are the same wheel, aren't they?) but I was wondering
&gt; if there were perhaps any cheap &amp; easily available 15&quot; wheels         
&gt; available for busses. 14&quot; tires are hard to find and really expensive 
&gt; in the proper weight/load class, but there seem to be tons of 15&quot;     
&gt; options. Just wondering if anybody knew of anything, or of any other  
&gt; issues which would be a factor.                                       
&gt; I seem to recall that there were some larger vanagon wheels, maybe    
&gt; even a 16&quot; wheel? I don't want anything too big, just thinking about  
&gt; options until I can put my 20&quot; spinners on there.                     
&gt; :)                                                                    
&gt; (just kidding about that last part)                                   
&gt; And yes, I am referring to the 72 and up wheel, not the earlier wide  
&gt; 5.                                                                    
&gt; thanks,
