But 69 to 73? have the lock as part of the inner handle.
74? to 79 has the lock button on top of the door sill.
If these are late style doors, a person putting them on an early bus would
need all new latches and inner handles to match.
Vis versa if they are early style doors going on a later bus.

Another problem is the hinge bolts.
Up to mid-75 the bolts were Allen head. They went thru the hinge and bolted
into the threaded piece welded to the A pillar.
Mid-75 and up the bolts were 13mm headed. They went thru the welded piece on
the A pillar and into the threaded holes og the hinge.
You cannot put i.e. 74 doors on a 77 and vis versa.

There is no such thing as a universal 69 to 79 door!

These are brand new, genuine Volkswagen, complete front doors for a '69-79
bus. Coming from Europe but actually made in Volkswagen's Brazilian factory.
Not just a door skin, but the complete door.  But only door; no glass, door
handle, window crank mechanism, etc.  Price would be $499.95 a pair plus
about $20-$30 shipping.  (Sold in pairs only).
