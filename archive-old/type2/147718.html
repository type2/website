Hi Karl,

The doors on my bus have a pull handle below the interior latch, same  
as on this picture:

The door panels aren't original, but I thought (assumed) this handle  
was present on all 68-79 buses. All of my buses have had them.  
Closing the door with a window crank is not a good solution.

Happy trails,

But if you do this, you loose the door pull to close
the door.

You can always use the window crank......
