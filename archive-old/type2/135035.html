Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

the Mallorys do fit on T-4s, but it is tight, and sometimes requires
drive-pinion re-indexing. If you have a VDO sending unit in the stock
location, you need a relocation kit to ensure clearance with the Mallory.

I know this because we sell 10X as many Mallory's as any other VW vendor in
the World, and also have more tuning experience with them then anyone with
the exception of Jake Raby (who runs one on 4 out of 5 engines on his dyno).
The Unilite is the finest distributor available for the VW Engine, it even
destroy's the MSD.
