Subject: Exhaust mounting question

Simple question:
After reassembling exhaust and getting ready to start Frances ('76 T4), it
seems odd that there isn't a hanger of some kind to support the left rear
section of exhaust.  With my current assembly, all the weight of that side
of the exhaust is being supported by where the heater box clamps to the fan
housing.  What am I missing?  Is there something that bolts to the fan
housing to support the elbow or what?  I can't find any pictures that show
this area to know what I am missing.

Thanks all,
Niall
