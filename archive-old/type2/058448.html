J. C. Whitney used to have an item in the catalog that looked exactly like the
faucet and pump in my wife's 76. The pump could be purchased separately for
$12.98 around 6-8 years ago. They may still carry it. It was a direct
replacement for the one that was in her bus at the time ( I don't if it was
orig. or just a good universal replacement ) It worked fine, and as far as I
know is still in use by the current owner.
