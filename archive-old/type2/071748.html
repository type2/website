&lt;&lt; Yes.  You have a one year, single state (CA.) only bus.  I know b/c I have 
one too.
Assuming the bus was brought into the new world through California, she is 
catalyic
equipped.  As far as I know, that was the only difference.  Being that she 
has a
catalytic convertor, the exhaust is unique to 1978 only and California.  
Check to
see if your exhaust is there, specifically the crossover pipe.  The crossover 
pipe
is the single unique part that is not replaceable new or remanufactured.  If 
you
have it, hang on to it.  The crossover pipe connects the right heat exchanger 
to the
Y pipe which is also connected to the left heat exchanger and the catalytic
converter.  Anymore questions, just holler...
