Subject: PurchasingTires

I would like to ask where people purchase their tires at  a reasonable
price.  I have just started looking for 185R14's with a load range of
C or D and I am getting prices in the range of $400 (for four) and
comments about &quot;we'll have to order them and it will take about
ten days&quot;.  I thought I had read on here about people ordering them
online in the range of about $60 a piece.  You can pmail responses
to me.  I am in the Raleigh NC area.  Thanks for any information you
can provide.
                                                                    Bill &amp;
