&gt; &gt;BN4 Heater For Sale
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Still in bus which was restored by previous owner. Fully connected so I
&gt; &gt;assume it has all the parts. I havn't tried to start it because I have a
&gt; &gt;fear of gasoline and know it hasn't been started in at least 5 years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It is in a 1969 Westy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Make an offer! (I know what they usually sell for.)
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Eric,  don't be afraid of it, they have worked safely in vehicles, even
&gt; airplanes for over 60 years!!  I have almost 30 busses at my place and 4
&gt; have had engine fires, but in working on gas heaters for almost 20 years,
I
&gt; have NEVER seen a gas heater that had caught fire.  You would love the
heat
&gt; your heater puts out and you already have it installed!!!  If you leave it
&gt; in your bus and have it checked, it will increase the value of your bus.
&gt; If you take it out, you have to pull the engine and gas tank to get all
the
&gt; ducts out and there will be two large holes where the ducts go through the
&gt; bus.
&gt;
&gt; Don't sell it, get it checked over, you'll LOVE IT!!!!!!
