List,
I know this has been hashed out over the years, but searching the archives has
turned up little specific info.

I recently acquired a 71 bus - advwag - with no engine.
Is the engine case a '1-year only' for the 71 because of the bosses for the
mustache bar?
A buddy says i can use a type3 case for this thing as well - is this correct?
Are they the exact same case? There's a mustache bar in a type3, right?  Can i
use it in my bus?

Thanks for any help.

BTW - found an old, 'unstuck' &quot;Know More&quot; Air Cooled Junkyard bumper sticker
under the zbed in this thing: Very cool.
