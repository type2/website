I am wanting to recover my front seats in my 74 BUS, and I am wondering what 
the best brand on the market is. I have been looking into TMI, and the ones 
Wolfsburg West sells. I also am wondering if basket weave or square weave is 
correct for my vehicle, TMI says square weave, while Wolfsburg West says 
basket weave, my VIN is 2242057872. Also, are the horsehair seat pads really 
any better then the foam ones? Any help with this is greatly appreciated.

Nathan.
