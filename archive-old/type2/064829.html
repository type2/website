Subject: re: servos

When I stripped a 73 to put front disks on the 70, the servo was thrashed,
so... didn't put one in.
Kept the old brake cylinder, added the proportioning valve. Car stops just
like a non-servo bus, just faster. (I might add, I never liked the vacuum
brakes in my friend's 74... there was a certain point at which WHOOOSH the
brakes came on strong and all the blood would run to the front of your
brain. No refinement! Stopped that sucker quick, though.

PS someone please let me know if I've been riding a deathtrap for 5 years
(&quot;Oh no, not a PROPORTIONING valve! Aiieeee!&quot;).
