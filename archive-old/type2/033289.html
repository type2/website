&gt; Jan and Listees,

&gt; I have a picture somewhere of a splitty (or maybe a model of a splitty?)
&gt; in a wind tunnel... the nose and sides have tufts of yarn attached so that
&gt; the airflow patterns can be observed.  Crude but effective -- we do the
&gt; exact same thing on airplanes and cars today. VW tested several different
&gt; variations of splitty front end; one was pretty square, another very
&gt; rounded but without angled windows, and one was close to the version that
&gt; we see on the road.
&gt;

    I just bought some Vanagon brochures from '80 &amp; '81.  One of them has is
basically about all the neat stuff that VW engineers did to update the Type2 from
Baywindow to Vanagon.

    One paragraph states:

    &quot;The Vanagon body shell was designed with the assistance of a computer, using
graphic projections.  All design data were fed into a second computer that controls
a driving simulator.
    Aerodynamic work was carried out in Europe's largest climatic wind tunnel, the
massive VW installation at Wolfsburg.
    After thousands of hours of testing, changing, and testing again, Vanagon's
drag coefficient was reduced to a mere 0.44.  This figure compares favorably with
many sedans, and is below that of conventional vans.  It contributes considerably
to Vanagon's fuel efficiency.&quot;

    This is accompanied by several pics of a Vanagon in the wind tunnel.  One of
them shows the flow pattern &quot;demonstrating Vanagon's aerodynamic structural
soundness&quot;.

    Also has photos of track testing at Ehra-Lessien (VW test track).

        Take care

            JonR
