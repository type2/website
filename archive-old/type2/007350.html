My &quot;new&quot; 71 VW camper worked fine for abt one month. It didn't seem to be holding  a charge so I replaced the battery. It will run in the driveway for about 45 minutes and then it quits. It will drive for various lengths of time before it looses a charge. I am not a mechanic but I got the Muir book and I want to learn.   We live in small rurual community and no one is even interested, anyway, in fixing it. A friend told me it could be the voltage regulator, generator or alternator. Great. Now where do I start?  Please help because I love my new van and I need it for work and schoo.
