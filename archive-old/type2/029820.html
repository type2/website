&gt; I have this question that has been bugging me for a long time.  I have a
&gt; 1972 bus and as I'm sitting in the driver seat, I reach down behind my right
&gt; calf and there is this knob that goes in and out.  I can't figure out for
&gt; the life of me what that is for.  I see no changes whatsoever and haven't
&gt; found info on it in any of my manuals.  Any ideas??

Don't do that!  You'll go blind!

It's the control that turns on the heat to the center seat.  When you pull
it out, a might blast of heat is delivered through the floor-level vent
behind the driver's seat bulkhead.
 
&gt; Also, the PO was a wanna be McGyver with the electrical system.  Often,
&gt; especially after running for a couple hours, when I try to start my bus,
&gt; nothing happens.  I found the trick is to reach under my dash, wiggle all
&gt; the wires and try again.  Most of the time that does that trick.  In fact,
&gt; it seems the problem wire is a yellow one that is joined with a male/female
&gt; electrical connector combination that is encased in the original VW plastic.
&gt; I haven't taken the time to find out where it goes and comes from, but that
&gt; may not even be the problem.  Any ideas as to what I should do here??

Get a good wiring diagram (bentley manual, etc).  Then take an afternoon
to go through the wiring under the dash.  Work on one wire at a time and
make sure all the connnections are workmanlike.  Those wire that are
twisted together and insulated with old masking and duct tape have got to
go!

If you don't already know how, this is a good time to learn to solder.
You'll need a good 140W gun for this sort of work.
