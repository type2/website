Subject: windshield gasket solution

listees- what is your thought on spraying wd-40 between the gasket and the
windshield perimeter, to try and slide the rubber down tight to the corners
where leaks occur. perhaps it is bunched up a little too much up top, and
some slack can be brought back down with finger/thumb pressure. wd-40...
thoughts or suggestions on other products?

on the other front: i pulled the engine and tranny on the 68 and found
nearly new german clutch components. clink glasses - that calls for a new
stock muffler. donor tranny getting new seals at all shafts today. the van
ness library was a big help there.
