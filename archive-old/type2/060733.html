Subject: Sunroof Cables ...

Greetings, All.

	This past weekend, I tool apart the sunroof on the green '79 bus.
In the process I found the reason why one side was not lifting correctly was
that the right cable is full of kinks.  So, needless to say I am looking for
cables to replace this right one.  I have a lead on some straight cables,
but they are broken off of the lifters.  

	Does anyone know if cables broken off of the lifters can be
repaired? (Welded back on perhaps?)

	Does anyone have any straight (whole)sunroof cables that they would
be willing to part with (perhaps you are adding a poptop)?

Thanks,
	Peter
