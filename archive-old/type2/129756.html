Subject: Dipstick Thermometer at WalMart?

I was walking through the grocery section of WalMart when I saw a display 
of deep fat fryer thermometers  hanging on a hook about shoulder high.

The stainless steel thermometers were exactly as long and almost the same 
diameter as the dipstick on my 1976 two liter suitcase engine. And my 
engine oil could be considered a kind of fat, I suppose. Hmmmm.

I paused, touched one of them, and noted the price......under three 
dollars. I can afford this. The analog temperature read-out dial was about 
two inches across and half an inch thick, and graduated between zero and 
500 degrees Fahrenheit. An arrow pointer indicated the actual number.

I wasn't shopping for such a device, but had been reading here about the 
importance of having a head temperature indicator, and how the oil 
temperature might or might not be related to that number. And right there 
in front of me was a device for easily and cheaply measuring the 
temperature of the oil in the crankcase. So, I just grabbed it and put it 
in the cart along with the groceries.

When I got back home, I took it out of the bubble wrap and went to the bus, 
pulled the dipstick, and compared them side-by-side.  Exact match as to 
length. Dipstick was more rectangular in cross section, like a blade, but 
the thermometer was a straight spike with a round cross section, slightly 
smaller than the diameter of the dipstick.

I pressed the spike of the thermometer into the dipstick tube and it slid 
smoothly down pretty much like the real dipstick, until the round dial unit 
bottomed out on the top of the dipstick tube. Might need a rubber seal at 
that point.  The dial was facing up at me, just under the upper line of the 
alternator belt. Plenty of clearance there. Dial was easy to read.

Haven't had time to start the engine and run any tests. Thought I should 
run this past the people on this list and see if there were any problems 
that could be forseen prior to starting the engine. Speak up if you know 
that this is a bad idea and that the oil will blow out, or something will 
hit the lower end of the spike. I have a lot of respect for the experience 
and insight of this group. Lets hear from you.

Just for the record, the thermometer is patented by the 2002 Young America 
Group, Inc., 15790 Dooley Road, Addison, Texas 75001.  They have showrooms 
in Bentonville, Arkansas, at 2104 Walton Blvd., suite 5/6.
Their phones are 1-972-385-3740  and  1-479-237-1569. They have a web site

The bar code of the product is &lt;6  9090390186  5&gt; and it is made in China.
