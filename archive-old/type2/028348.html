Hey all,

	I just received an email stating that the archive has been taken down.  I
don't know what that is all about.  But I do know that I get alot of info
from there, which helps to keep the digest from being overloaded with my
ameature questions.  But, since I can not look at the archive at this time,
I am bringing my question to the digest after much though.
	What I would like to do is take my dash board out because the wiring below
it is an absolute mess.  What I would like to know is if anyone has some
tips for me about what tools I may need before diving into this and if there
is anything that I should expect along the way.  You have helped me very
much and appreciate the time that you all have taken to help eachother out
as a family.  If anyone can give my some clues before I attack this it would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Troy
Keep on rollin'
