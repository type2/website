Subject: no wonder it won't start!  almost no spark at all!  even with
  spare coil!

I put the battery on the charger to get better cranking
while testing, and turned th key on...than I used the
remote starter and checked spark from the coil
wire.....almost nothing at all!  tried a spare coil and get
same results...any suggestions? I shluld know this answer,
but my mind in blank right now as I have not been eating
today!  ;-(  dang it! gotta eat some dinner and see what
y'all ahve to suggest....bad condenser?? points?
