Subject: Re: respirator help!

&gt;I am getting to a point where i am going to need to do some
&gt;priming/painting on my bus before too long.
&gt;
&gt;Before i have always used a standard canister respirator, but you cant use
&gt;one of those with a beard the instructions say, it wont seal right.
&gt;
&gt;I now have a beard and dont really want to remove it, but i dont want to
&gt;destroy my lungs either...
&gt;
&gt;any of you other bus-nuts bearded and have a solution for this dilemma?


Steve,

You might want to rig up your own fresh air helmet with face shield, or
even purchase one (which may be a bit expensive).

These things are great for all kinds of hazardous tasks such as sand
blasting, spray painting and paint/body putty sanding.

If you want to get creative, purchase a large enough swivel, attach to the
ceiling of your shop, put a piece of PVC tubing on it, then hook your hose
onto the end of the tubing.  It will look like the pressure wands at the
car wash.  You can work all the way around your car and you won't have to
drag your hose!!  We also do this with welder leads.

The prices sound a bit high, you may be able to piece a system together for
much less, try looking through Harbor Frieght or Nothern Hydraulics.

If you want to see what a system looks like, go to:
