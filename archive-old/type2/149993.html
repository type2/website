&gt; does this seem right?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;&quot;The
&gt; external braid hose we can buy now doesn't seem to be very good
&gt; quality and even if it was, it is the wrong size. It's all 7mm which
&gt; has too  stretch too much over the FI fittings, so it fails there
&gt; quickly. VW started with 7mm, but quickly changed to 7.5mm. In the
&gt; end, 8mm is an even better choice, and just happens to be equal to
&gt; 5/16&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; The best hose you can currently buy is just ordinary 5/16&quot; gas hose
&gt; from your local FLAPS. DON'T bother with the stuff they sell
&gt; specifically for FI, as that is made for much higher pressure FI
&gt; systems and costs 3x as much.&quot;&quot;

This is a pantload if they are suggesting using 5/16&quot; fuel hose on a fuel
injected VW Bus, absolute rubbish. It does not fit and will leak, sooner or
later. 5/16&quot; hose coupled with worm-drive clamps is the worst possible
scenario, as you must over tighten the clamps to prevent leakage, the over
tightening then destroys the hose where the rubber extrudes through the
holes in the band of the clamp. I am going to go out on a limb and say that
most engine fires in an injected Bus are caused by using 5/16&quot; FLAPS fuel
hose and crappy hose clamps.

VW never changed to 7.5mm hose either. The Mercedes 7.5mm hose is excellent
to use however, very good quality and fit, as it is a bit undersized by
design.

I will agree with the part about some braided hose being of inferior
quality. the all-rubber hose by contitech is the best thing going for fuel
line, but the braided one by contitech is also perfect to use.
