Subject: noise in rear of engine? 78 westy

Hi!  The mystery of the wiring is now solved, and I know a bunch more about
the bus wiring and the steering wheel/ignition switch.  Thanks to the list the
engine starts and runs fine, ......well almost.  All of this was my
stupidity....

Start up is loud and a knocking / rattling noise comes from the rear of the
engine.  Doesn't sound like a rod or a lifter but more erratic and louder.
like something banging around and rattling.  I put the stethoscope on and
couldn't find the noise.  put a pipe to my ear to listen and still can't tell
exactly but near the fan/ alternator area.

I did notice the fan belt bouncing quite a bit.  About 1&quot; flop ...  I had just
tighten the belt.

What do you think about removing the belt and trying it?  that would eliminate
the alternator and the belt right?

Then the other noise... when the clutch is engaged and disengaged there is a
squeal.  I just replaced the pilot bearing.  TO and everything else looked
fine, before the tear down I had no problems with the clutch except hearing
the pilot bearing squeal.  How much up and down travel should there be in the
pilot shaft?  TO bearing OR pilot bearing again?  Less than 30 minutes on the
present pilot bearing.....

I really don't want to pull the engine again....

I am going to go pull the fan belt and see what I hear...

thanks is advance!
