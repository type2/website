Hi all,

     I just replaced my AFM as it had both worn tracks &amp; the mechanic could
not get the CO below 2.5%.  I took it back in for him to adjust the CO on
the new AFM &amp; he set it to 1% per spec.  Now the idle is rough, slow &amp; it
seems like it wants to die when cold.  It never does die it just gets real
rough running.  Also it seems to hesitate or miss as I accelerate through
the gears.  All does seem fine at speed.  Any ideas?  I have already done
the full tuneup &amp; fuel filter replacement.
Thanks.
