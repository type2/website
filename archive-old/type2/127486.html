Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust inside the bus - update

I recently replaced the seal on my 74. It doesn't really create an air-tight seal, particularly not around the
luggage rack. (Maybe I did something wrong?) I believe the 1/8'' or so gap between the seal and the roof in the
front is to allow the luggage rack to drain. I'm not sure the lack of a seal is going to create a wind tunnel
effect inside.

Perhaps your bus is haunted by an evil spirit.

&gt; With a friend driving the bus down the interstate I can
&gt; feel air rushing in from the poptop area. It is not coming
&gt; from the front of the bus but from the rear. The fiberglass
&gt; roof for the poptop is missing the seal that goes around the
&gt; lower edge of the roof, the rear section is in place though.
&gt; The canvas is in great condition so I can only imagin that
&gt; air is coming in through the zipper seams?? I'm going to
&gt; check the canvas again though to be sure certain. I wonder
&gt; if it would be probable for air rushing in past the missing
&gt; seal to pull along some of the exhaust fumes from the rear
&gt; of the bus (at the dead air space) and thats how this is
&gt; all is happening.
