Subject: Re: [T2] The ideal VW motor replacement

I have seen engines that were triangular shaped, 3 crankshafts, opposing pistons, with a big fan pressurizing the area inside the triangle.
I have seen them on the internets at least.
Very cool, does anybody remember what they were called, who made them?
