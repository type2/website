Yeah, and the month before last in the nuts and bolts
section the tech editor told a guy that on his dual
vac distributor that the the port on the outside of
the can  was the retard port and the that the port on
the inside of the cone nearest the distributor body
was for advance. WRONG! This is and the over-abundant
typos in each issue, lead me to wonder the same thing
as you: Does anyone check this stuff after its
written?
Doubtful. BTW, I will not be renewing my subscription.
