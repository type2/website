Anybody with the 71 bus, relocate your fuse block out of the metal bracket
and tie it into a safer position where the exposed un-fused current can't
make contact with ground.

VW owes all of us who experiened the fuse block meltdown some compensation,
but I don't have the time to pursue it.  They must have done this on lots of
cars as they assembled them, the design was obviously a huge blunder to have
the bracket this way and they must have had buses coming right out of
assembly with shorts here.

This was my experience in the 71, you will get some intermittant current
shorts on bumps or with temperature changes and then someday the fuse block
just melts down on the right side from touching the metal bracket.  I had a
couple of years frustration with this (sign is engine going dead while
driving into a colder environment and hitting a bump), and a big meltdown
forced me to pull it all out, I was able to find a way to use the fuse block
while bypassing the damaged circuit but don't have the specifics.

I then had related meltdown of the headlight switch due to internal short to
ground (it had been heat-damaged in the earlier meltdown, I think.)

I got another fuse block but it was intimidating to trade all those
connections and I have limited access to the dash from underneath, have to do
it all through the instrument panel or remove the underdash air conditioner
(yep, it's the only one I ever saw there and it's in a 71).  So I'm still
letting that last circuit stay bypassed.  I have moved my fuse block up and
forward into midst of the other wiring and have wired and taped it there.

&gt; Hi gang:
&gt;
&gt; Had an exciting time of it on Friday.  I drove the '71 Westy to work
&gt; for the first time.  On the way in the engine died as I turned into the
&gt; parking lot, but restarted immediately so I thought little of it.
&gt; Maybe just a little cold.
&gt;
&gt; But on the way home it died again.  No idiot lites.  Key cranks but
&gt; nothing fires.  Smoke starts billowing from under dash.  Joe
&gt; scrambles for something to disconnect the battery with.  Can't find
&gt; it.  Realizes he hasn't put an extinguisher in the car.  More smoke
&gt; from under dash.  Joe sees a wire crisping and yanks at harness to
&gt; get at whatever's shorting.  Disconnects the crisping wire and
&gt; smoke stops, but there's still something sparking under there when
&gt; I move the harness.
&gt;
&gt; Turns out the fuse box had slipped out of its bracket and was
&gt; shorting.  Smoked the 15 circuit from the key to the fusebox, from
&gt; which coil, wipers, and all other switched-circuit goodies depend.
