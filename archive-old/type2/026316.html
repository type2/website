Subject: Death of the standard transmission
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11015500FA_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

I read an article that claimed in 1997 only 17% of cars sold in NA were
standard transmission.
It predicted 13% for 1998, and asteep decline after that.
It  was a chicken and egg problem. 
Less standards are being sold, so less models offer it. 
( A lot of cars don't come in standards anymore)
Becasue of this, demand drops further, making it not worth while
to spend the $1million required to emmisions certify the extra 
drivetrain configuration. It pointed out that if you only sold 
a few thousand manual transmissions, then the testing cost would be 
$500-1000 PER CAR!. It even raised the possiblity that 
an automatic would become standard equipment,
and a &quot;Standard transmission&quot; could become an extra cost option
on a few models.

BTW I've got a car now with an automatic, and don't like it. Instead of
having
several control inputs that directly influence what my drive wheels are
doing, I now only
have one - the  gas pedal - and it doesn't actually control the drive
wheels, but just seems to offer
vague suggestions to the damn computer, which doesn't always pay attention
to my input. I'm not looking
forward to winter;-( Ricken fricken ricken frick!
