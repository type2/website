&gt; &gt; The car still has Oregon plates on it and is quite rustfree, except for
&gt; &gt; the cab floor. The underside looks like new. Oregon must be good on
&gt; &gt; cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Lots of wet, but no salt.
&gt; 

And maybe not even wet. Only about a third of Oregon is wet - most of the
rest is dry enough to qualify as desert.
