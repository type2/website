&quot;emiLy Q.&quot; wrote:In fact, when you first described the project I thought of
just putting

&gt; new laminate (melamine?  - also all sorts of colors are available) over
&gt; the old.  I haven't ever tried it, but if you really have no tools, you
&gt; could probably do rough cuts by scoring and snapping the laminate and
&gt; then trimming once it's glued on.

Emily, list:
Pros use carbide hooked blades to score the laminate and just snap it like
glass.
Contact cement is the glue (careful, it burns!). Can evn finish nicely with
large file.
