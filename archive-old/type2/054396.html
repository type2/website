Subject: cold start injector

Hi all,

    I am diagnosing a hard starting problem on my 76 Westy.  I think I have
narrowed it down to the cold start valve.  Here is what I found.  I have
fuel pressure in the line.  I also have power to the valve at the right
times.  When I take the valve out &amp; hook up a source of power &amp; ground I get
a click but no fuel coming out of the tip.  Then when I disconnect the fuel
rail , I get fuel.  unless I am missing something here, this has to be a bad
valve.  Cold start, fuel pressure regulator &amp; fuel pump contacts all check
out.  At $53, I wanted to double check my thinking with you folks.  Thanks.
