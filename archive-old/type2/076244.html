It's an ASI tent.

Except for color, the auction tent is identical to the came-with tent for my
'80 Vanagon ASI. The serial number on my tent suggests manufacture in '79.

It mates to the van with a heavy magnetic tape which is sewn onto the edges
of the &quot;storm flap&quot;, you can see it in one of the pictures.

While looking at the pictures, also notice a tag below the White Stag logo
on the front view. On my tent that tag reads, &quot;Manufactured Exclusively for
A.S.I. by White Stag Camping&quot;.

The seller does not have the tent set up right, the poles should cross on
the sides. The triangular windows are then above the poles. This also
explains why he has &quot;extra&quot; pole sections.
