Subject: Re: [T2] Loose ends - Re: [T2] Diagnostic Expertise Needed

Sorry guys - this thing just keeps refusing to be
easy...

&gt; There is a VW bulletin [...] where they specify not 
&gt; using a head gasket [...] However, to maintain the 
&gt; compression ratio you need to put a shim under the 
&gt; cylinders [...] In your case, I would use a head 
&gt; gasket if there is already one

Here's my problem - I was all set to use the head
gaskets, but when the new AMC head arrived, I noticed
that the machined mating surface for the cylinder is
approx 1mm higher than the combustion-chamber head
surface, whereas on the old head, the mating surface
and the combustion chamber surface are flush.

You can see pictures of my old and new heads here:

http://artntek_dot_com/type2/heads/

Also, AMC included a note in big red capital letters:
DO NOT USE HEAD GASKETS!!
* THE CYLINDER HEAD HAS AN IMPROVED COMBUSTION CHAMBER
WHICH INCORPORATES THE SEALING SURFACE FOR THE
CYLINDER
* USE OF HEAD GASKETS WILL RESULT IN EXTREMELY LOW
XCOMBUSTION AND WILL VOID ANY WARRANTIES EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED.

So... I'm thinking maybe I *shouldn't* use the head
gaskets after all. HOWEVER - I don't know whether or
not I need to put shims under the cylinders to
compensate, or if the &quot;lip&quot; that is machined into the
new head already compensates for the height
difference? Has anyone else used AMC heads with this
lip, and if so, did you use shims under the cylinders
or not?

I have to fit this thing tomorrow, so any help anyone
can give would be gratefully received

If I do need to remove the cylinders after all, will
it be possible to put them back on without using a
ring compressor? (I have one, but I'm sure it's too
long to fit between the piston and the crankcase with
the pistons in situ)

thanks
