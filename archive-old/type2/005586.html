I know this is old thread that comes up time from time.  Anyway, there is
the smell of propane when opening the valve to the propane tank.  I don't
want to work on it myself so I'll just get it completely serviced somewhere.
Question is - for those who have had theirs serviced what's the opinion on
the best to have it done?  Dealer? (I can't imagine so), RV dealers?, RV
service centers like Camping World?.  You can email me directly if this has
been brought up too much on the list.  Thanks.
