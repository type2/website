Subject: Wiring Question

The engine is now back in the turtlebus. Spent the weekend reconnecting
lots of bits and pieces. When I pulled the engine about a year ago, I
tagged all the wires and hoses knowing this would be a slow project.
This was a great help for 98% of the hoses and wires. It seems that I'm
still left with questions on 3 wires.

The 3 wires are in a bundle of their own, entering the front of the
engine compartment on the passenger side. This bundle immediately turns
toward the drivers side being routed along the bottom of the gas tank
compartment cover past the intake air distributor. They then turn
towards the rear of the bus, being routed under the drivers side intake
manafold then emerging again near the distributor. One of the 3 wires is
blue with black bands ( I think this is supposed to connect to the oil
pressure sensor). Another is black with no bands or stripes (Positive
side of coil ?).
The third wire is white with a green stripe. I have no idea where this
third wire should go because it was cut off where it exits the bundle
jacket by the previous owner.

A little lesson about tagging wires: This bundle had fallen to the
ground while the engine was out and likely got wet. The notes I had
written on the tags are gone! Probably should have covered them with
transparent tape.

This is a 75 bus originally with an 1800cc FI engine.

Could someone please look for this bundle on their bus and confirm where
these wires go. I have checked Bently and think I've identified the two
uncut wires but I find no reference to the third color coded wire. I
will feel so much more confident with visual confirmation.
Thanks.
Tom
Igor, prepare the battery cables. This Turtlebus just MAY live again!
