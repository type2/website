Subject: testing for FI leaks...an idea?

Never tried it, but my brain is always thinking.....a trick for testing
space continuity and leaky cracks under a basement slab for radon
mitigation is to place the cavity under vacuum (stick a vacuum hose into
a drilled hole) and then use a smoke stick to test whether the smoke
gets sucked into suspect areas.  So why not put the air system under
vacuum (via a T perhaps in one of the larger lines) and use a smoke
stick to see if any connections suck in the smoke?
