Both of my stock '70 Westies are giving me 23-24 MPG, depending on the 
usual variables.
If the buses are driven just in the city stop and go, MPG drops down to 
around 20-21 MPG.

It was a real effort to make Casper meet the same MPG as NewBus, but with a 
tweak here, and a tweak there, he finally got there.
Finally discovering and setting to proper timings, and using Hall sensors, 
should set me nicely for the long haul with economic fuel consumption from 
both buses.

An important leap was when I got away from the concept of static timing and 
went to the much better &quot;desired advance against running RPM&quot; concept.
The effort cost was a small bit of money spent for the timing stuff, 
resulting in much more satisfaction returned as my reward.

Interestingly enough, the static light readings on the buses are, as follows:
Casper = +7.5 degrees, or maybe just a wee bit more.
NewBus = + 2.0 degrees

The vac advance dizzy in NewBus is the original unit supplied from Germany 
when the bus was manufactured`.
The vac advance dizzy in Casper was refurbished by myself, is the proper 
unit, but just seems to not advance along the same curve plot as the one on 
NewBus, despite my trying to find out just why.

The weather has been crumby lately. When it breaks for the better, I am 
going to go out and take another set of static and dynamic readings to 
check what I think I have already measured properly, and make a log entry 
of the values in my recordings book.

Both buses have been driven for long hauls on the highway under all weather 
and altitude conditions, so I am now comfortable with my timing settings.

Timing being set to the proper advance, as well as the distributors being 
of vacuum advance design, seems to really be the answer to good MPG.

I must admit, however, that I still am not so sure but what pretty decent 
MPG could be obtained with a .009, if just timed to the proper running RPM 
advance, as opposed to what most of us do; and that is time with a static 
light.

Casper, when wearing a .009 dizzy, gave me just under 19 MPG as a best 
effort, with a more normal 18 MPG.  Again, I believe that I never did have 
the timing advanced quite far enough to optimize my MPG, just to be really 
fair on an analysis of the .009 performance.

That MPG is not with an Imperial gallon, BTW,
just with a sometimes Imperial price per gallon.
