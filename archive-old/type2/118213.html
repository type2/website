Subject: Re: [T2] parts from dealers

&gt;The trick is to only give them a part number. ... Keep looking for a 
&gt;friendly dealer because they do exist. Sometimes you'll find someone 
&gt;who used to own a bus and understands you.
&gt;What is encouraging is that VW is starting to make beetle parts 
&gt;available to the public. Of course, here in the US it's very 
&gt;inconvenient at present but still encouraging:

actually, i only gave the part #. the guy KNEW what it was! he also 
knew the BUG version was available, and knew the number. he was the 
FIRST vw dealer parts man i've ever met who didn't just say sorry and 
ring off. this was at chapman motors in phoenix.

&gt;
&gt;Hopefully they will do the same for the bus.

and remember, VWoA is NOT VWDeustchland. don't hold yr breath!
