Subject: Spotting Splittys and Loafs

Greetings,

When we first got our bus over a year ago, my wife was always amazed 
at my ability to spot busses from a distance. Not any more. It's the 
other way around now. She's really &quot;got the eye&quot; now and I'm missing 
the sightings. It's really cute how she can get excited now.

A short time ago on this list, the subject came up about how many 
splitty&quot;s there were in Seattle area. It's true, especially up 
around the U of W. Nothing like San Diego though , but still a high 
percentage I think. Right here in Oly (pop. aprox. 50,000), we also 
have lots of splitty's although half of them belong to Clara ;)

Last week I gave chase to a beautiful single cab (sealing wax red), 
here in town, but lost him at a stop light.
