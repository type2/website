Maybe the Bug got a lower compression ratio when it was rebuilt 
and the Bus still has it's old CR?

&gt;One question, tho- Where to time it?!? I'me getting mixed signals 
&gt;here folks!  20, 35, 7.5, depends on mex or german manufacture, etc.
&gt;Muir sez 7.5 for all 009.  Others say 20 for mexican 009, 35 for ge
&gt;rman parts. I am thoroughly confoozed.

What's important here is what people are referring to, you can easily
see if your 009 is German, it is cast in on the bottom of the distributor 
body, if it says nothing it's South American, if it says Germany well...

20 deg looks like the amount of advance the distributor provides. 

35 seems to be the total advance someone recommends for a particular 
engine, so that's the advance the distributor provides plus the static timing
point. I think 35 deg total is bit too much, but i won't exclude the possibillity
of an engine that lives happy with that setting.

7.5 is most probably a static timing point, which is about right for an 009 
imho. Still i'd like to point out that, especially with aircooled VWs, it's hard
to say that this or that is *the* right setting for such and such.

All the above figures seem to be crankshaft degrees, If you should stumble
across some Bosch data you should note that they often specify distributor 
degrees and RPM.

PS, I can fax a copy of the 231 178 009 spec sheet to anyone who wants it, 
it shows the advance curve and some other data, courtesy of Robert Bosch
Amsterdam.
