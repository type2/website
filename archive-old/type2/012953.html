Subject: 'clunking' camper

Hello list,

spring has finally arrived in Scandinavia, and it's time to wake up our
camper from six months of sleep. The engine is out of the car as it was
rebuilt so now would be good time to solve also the other problem but I
just don't know where to start.

Something is making 'clunking' noise when accelerating on 3rd and 4th
gear. First it was only 4th, but after we came home from honeymoon trip
across Europe last summer, it was 'clunking' on 3rd too. It still handles 
well, there are no noises when cornering, just when accelerating. It usually
stops when I take my foot off the gas pedal and try again slowly - though
even this did not help much when the car began clunking on 3rd gear also.
There are no noises when cruising at constant speed.

Any advice what this could be? 
Thanks you!
