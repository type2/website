I did mine with Rust-Oleum flat black in the tall cans at Home Depot.  It 
has held up really well.  If you decide to paint, make sure you use a flat 
finish or it will reflect light up into you eyes while you drive.

&gt;   Just finished some rust repair under my windshield. Before I get the 
&gt; new glass in, I figured I should clean up that little space between the 
&gt; windshield and the dash vents. There's a little bubbling of the paint 
&gt; there and a little bit-o-rust. Ideas anyone? I thought I would just spray 
&gt; a little rust converter on there. But maybe I should paint it?
