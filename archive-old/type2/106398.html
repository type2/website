Subject: RE: [T2] Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

&gt; Well sorta. Dont forget wind resistance. 


And if you can get your bus up to 60mph.

&gt;the laws of physics still say it takes a certain amount of energy to
move
a given object at a given speed.

A tire is a fulcrum and if you understand physics... the bigger the
fulcrum the more weight can be moved by less energy being exerted.
Doesn't matter where the speedometer cable is located, on the tranny or
on the front drivers wheel in a little cap. Even with it being there you
can see the difference that little cap has to make for one whole
rotation as compared to the smaller tire.  No holy grail, just simple
understanding of mechanical engineering.
