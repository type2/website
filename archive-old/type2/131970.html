Subject: Re: [T2] Powder Coating your TIN - anyone?

&gt; Power coated is good (i have done several sets of tin) if you can find a
&gt; budget price. The prices range from $50+ for 1 wheel in VA to 16 wheels here
&gt; in TN for $40. 

I just had this done. The finish is excellent: I went with a 60 degree
semi-gloss. Does anyone prime and sand engine tin? If you do then you are
one up on the powder coating because the sandblasting takes the rust away
down to the pits. Even so I don't think you can beat the look or durability.

The minimum charge out here is about $75-125 just to setup for one color
which is a drag. Since I didn't want the shroud or fan painted black I had
them do the sandblasting which they essentially did for free as part of the
order.
