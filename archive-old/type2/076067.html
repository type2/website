Subject: Oil Filter Cross Reference

My recently purchased 74 Bus has an external oil cooler on it.  The
oil lines were ran down through the opening where the normal oil
filter would go.  Since there wasn't enough room for the oil lines and
the normal oil filter it was replaced with a thinner, longer one.  It
is a Mann W719/5.  Does anyone have a cross reference for this filter
for Fram or someother oil filter?  Also, one of the oil lines has
developed a leak.  I am not sure where the end to the engine is at so
my question is can I get to it without removing the engine and alot of
engine tin or other parts?

Thanks,

Kevin
