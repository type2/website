Ron,
How long has it been since you've replaced the rubber brake hoses going to the
caliper? Old ones sometimes create the illusion of calipers not releasing. Darn
sight cheaper, too.

&gt; Perhaps an
&gt;intermittently sticking caliper--that will have to be a priority fix before
&gt;I start playing with the MIG--awww shucks!

&gt;(friction seemed fine   ;)
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  ROFL

&gt;but I still don't
&gt;know what's up and now I don't know if I owe two random acts of kindness or
&gt;if these guards are just messing with my head.

Obviosly, Ron, the Karma managers knew you'd be helping those phish pholks out,
started paying you back in advance.

Andy
