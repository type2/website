Subject: Neighbor looking for loaf

He knocked on my door today asking if &quot;China Cat&quot; was for sale. He is looking 
for preferably a Westy, not necessairly running, but would require pretty 
straight body. Anyone within &quot;recovery distance&quot; of Knoxville TN having 
anything like that for sale?

Let me know via email and I'll connect you with the buyer.

Cheers/Don Carron
