Subject: '73 Engine Rebuild

Hello all-
After extensive poking and prodding of my Westy's engine, see Mucho Carbon,
I have decided that the problem is in the rings of cylinder #3.  That plug
looks the worst, and passenger side cylinders are ok.  I have decided to do
a full rebuild.  Why?  Well, I want to get to know the motor better...no
seriously.  Since I purchased the bus from the PO, I haven't had to spend
that much time back there, and am thankful for that.  Now performance is at
an all-time low, and I want to go at from the ground floor.

I have found several sights on the web that offer extensive rebuild parts
(gaskets, rings, etc.).  Busdepot_dot_com seems to be one of the best, and I
have ordered from them before.  I have purchased the Muir guide and am
fairly confident in my toolbox.

My question is...Does anyone have an all-incompassing list of the parts that
I will need to do a first-rate job?  If so please send it to me.  There is
nothing worse than getting half-way in and finding that you don't have a
certain thingamabob to complete that project.

Thanks in advance
