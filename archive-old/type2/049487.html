Subject: [T2] RE: Listmember Xmas Party

Unfortunately, the response to my offer to host the annual Holiday party
usually held by Tom Forhan was minimal. Apparantly several list members who
had attended the previous events in Md. just couldn't make it to Pa. on that
day.  Meanwhile, Tom Carrington emailed me to say that he lives right around
the corner from Tom Forhan, and would love to host the party himself. Since
it seems more people can attend if the venue stays in Maryland, it certainly
makes sense for me to defer to Tom's gracious offer.  So he will be hosting
the party this year.  I believe that he has, or will soon, post the details
to all 3 of the lists, so be on the lookout for it.  Hopefully I'll be there
too if I can convince the family to take the drive that day.
