&gt; Also, is it a bad idea to use a 3 inch PVC pipe in the straight section after
&gt; the heater controls?

Been there, done that, fuggetdaboutit.

I've been toying (for years) with the idea of using a galvanized rain gutter
downspout. Even though its crosssection is rectangular, the ends can be
rounded out. Just haven't gotten around to doing it.
