Subject: Re: [T2] Speedometer Read Error

Jon
185/75R14 is not the standard size, even though tire shops would like
you to believe so because they stock them.

Stock tire size is 185R14 which really means 185/82R14. The tyres you
use have a circumference 8.5% shorter than stock. That makes the right
left tyre (as well as others) spin 8.5% faster than stock and
speedometer reading 8.5% above.

Seeing the size of your tyres tends to make me believe that you are
using passenger tyres which most likely are not meeting VW requirement
for the bus. I will do my best to avoid yet another tyre FART, but
here is what Bentley says about them:

...
Chapter 8 section 13.2 Caution note  &quot; Not all bias ply or radial ply
tires are the same. When you buy replacement tires, select only
bias-ply tires that have an 8 ply rating: select radial ply tires
designated &quot;reinforced&quot; or  for delivery vans and stations wagons-
with the suffix &quot;C&quot;. Other tires of identical size may have inadequate
load carrying capability.

Table III chapter 8 : Campmobile from August 1971; Delivery Van and
Station Wagon from August 1971 through March 1972. Tire 185 SR 14
Reinforced (Note says : correct replacement tire must bear word
&quot;REINFORCED&quot;. The maximum inflation pressure listed on the tire should
be 40 psi.

Table III chapter 8 : Delivery van and station wagon from April 1972.
185R 14 C. (Note says : correct replacement tire must bear the letter
&quot;C&quot; immediately after the number 14 in the size designation-and not
elsewhere. The maximum load inflation pressure listed on the tire
should be 55 psi.

&gt; I have checked everything and it looks fine. My tire size is 185 75 R14
&gt; standard size.
