Subject: RE: Is The Starter For an 091 different than a 3-rib?

-----Original Message-----
I replaced the 091 6 rib trans in my bus tonight with a 3 rib unit from a
&gt;73.  The only thing that didn't jive was the starter.  It has a collar on
&gt;the starter shaft that is intefering with the bellhousing causing it not
&gt;to bolt up.  The two bellhousings do look different and I am wondering if
&gt;I need to change the starter to an earlier model.  The bus is a 1971.
&gt;Any advice would be greatly appreciated


I put an 091 into my 72 bus combined with an 1800 74 engine. I used the 1800
clutch,
002 (3-rib) bellhousing and starter. I found that the 091 Bellhousing
required an 091
starter, which I didn't want to buy since I had a brand new 002 (3-rib)
starter on hand.
So I switched the bell housings over. So if you use a particular bell
housing, use the
compatible starter.

However, I was working with a pancake engine with an 1800 clutch, I'm not
sure if there
are any compatibility issues with mating those trannys to a 70 upright
engine. Would it
be necessary to use the early bellhousing? Quite possibly.
