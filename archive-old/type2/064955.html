Subject: ACS&amp;RT- Rescuing a Moountain Bus

 Greetings fellow Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue Team members. I'd like to offer a
report of the succesful rescue of a '67 Westfalia.

It was Tuesday morning, 0700. Wait, I'm leaving the house earlier on my day off
than I do for work? Hmmm...
Anyway, I headed over to my friend's place from whence we would depart on our
day's journey. He had spoken with a fellow in Asheville, NC, about 230 miles
away, about a camper he had. Although the bus was rusty, it had a clean roof
rack, original child's cot, nice interior, and the *perfect* side tent from a
late model. The price looked good, so we were off to the rescue.
  We took his '71 crew cab, which provided smooth sailing on the 5 hour journey
there. We were lucky, in that most of the driving was along the highway. We
were also lucky in the fact that this was supposed to be a fairly easy mission,
as the bus supposedly ran. Supposedly can mean a lot of things, so we had all
my tools along as well.
 We arrived around lunchtime, and began to check out the bus. Velvet green,
with reverse lights, this was a nice bus. However, the winter salt of the
mountain roads had take its toll. the rockers were bad, as were the front
floors, and there was some rust showing on the main frame. On the other hand,
the dashboard was the most pristine Velvet Green I have ever seen. Since that's
what you look at while driving, it made it a lot easier to accept the rest of
the rust.
 A deal was struck, after a test drive proved the only mechanical fault to be a
loose tie rod, which made her a bit wobbly. We decided she was roadworthy as
she was, which was amazing, and decided to head on back up the road, as to do
as little as possible driving in the dark.
 Since it had my license plate on it, I got to drive the bus, and was amazed at
the difference in power between the dual port she was running, versus the
single port I run in my '67. Although mine is an earlier '67, I would assume
the tranny gearing is the same, right??? Anyway, she cruised happily at 60,
whereas my bus's happy speed is about 53. (Any comments on that comparison?)
 So, we returned safely, and happily uneventfully home, and his wife had the
chance to check the bus out. She seemed to like it, so he's hopefully going to
use it as leverage to buy a welding rig he's been wanting for a while.
Anyway, I offered to take the tent, since it didn't really match, but he
declined for some reason...
So, this is a rescue story with a happy ending for all!
Yay! Stay tuned for other stories to come, and I for one would love to hear of
other rescues!
Many thanks to those who said they would order an Air Cooled Search and Rescue
Team shirt, and have already sent their orders in. If you said you would get a
shirt, please do send the order in.
I'll post after all the t-shirt business settles down as to how many extras I
have and such...
Thanks, and Happy Friday, since I'm headed away this evening through the
weekend.
