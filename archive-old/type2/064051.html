So natasha!kombi_at_adobe.corp.adobe_dot_com says:
&gt; the ground!).  As well, California has its share of ugly.  Inviting
&gt; flames here, I personally think that the central valley of California
&gt; beats other places hands-down.  It's flat, hot (when not foggy), plain
&gt; butt-ugly.  Odd state, where horrid places like Red Bluff are sooo close
&gt; to richly beautiful places like Shasta...

I concur, having grown up in the armpit of CA, It is thee nothing-to-
do-est place in the bear state.  Highway 99 and I-5 are such a drag
to drive up and down on.  The speed limit just can't be made fast
enough to get up or down the Central Valley.  Makes the Southwest
Airlines flight real inviting whenever you want to take a trip
to LA or S.D.  When we were kids, my dad drove all 8 of us down
to LA every other year.... Ugh!... I hated that drive!  No AC,
no walkmen, no electronic games, no radio....  What a pain!

&gt; 
&gt; One last bit of flame-bait:  if you ever drive the upper Sacramento
&gt; valley (Red Bluff, Redding, etc.) in a VW, plan to do it late at night.
&gt; This area has some of the hottest weather in the US.  A cool day there
&gt; is over 100, I think, in the summer.  Even the nights are...

Around 105 average.....  Ahhh so pleasant....  ;)
