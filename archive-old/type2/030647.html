Yep.  another few thousand miles, another pressure plate.

At least, I think its the PP again.  Last weekend in hartwell, I had lost
some pressure at the clutch pedal, as if perhaps teh cable had stretched
on me.  2 turns of the wingnut fixed it back to normal feel. (it wasnt
gradual, it was a &quot;whered THAT come from?&quot; feeling)

So anyway.  Today, I  hit my exit on the interstate, and as I declutched
to downshift to third, it felt wierd.  Continued my downshift, roled
through the yield sign, and made my right turn.

As I proceeded up the hill in second, the engine was spinning real
fast..hmm...says I.  Shift to third.  engine still revs high.  hmm.  F*ck.
A few more check confirms that the clutch is slipping.

So I think perhaps the cable &quot;slack&quot; that showed up went away. (makes no
sense, but would explain the trouble..).  Get home, drop it back one turn.
(btw, the new feeling was of instant release, no play...)

Now it feels JUST like last time I lost pressure from that one year old
PP from BD....*sigh*  that was what?  May perhaps?

I'm going to hope and pray it will make it to and from work tomorrow,
sicne I have no energy to screw with moving the engine and tranny back in
the 66 far enough to put the new coupling on...Particularly since at work
I managed to rip the drivers door off a 99 Toyota Sienna....*sigh*

not a good day.

Anyone have any recommendations for good quality clutches OTHER then
Sachs?  this is the third one in the 2 years 4 months that I've owned
Ichigo...


thanks...david
