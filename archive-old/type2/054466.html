Jess Bookshar sends:

&gt; Hi all.  first post to the list, but i love this as a goldmine of vw info.
&gt; anyway, I'm looking to put an 1800 porsche 914 engine into my 72 bus, but i
&gt; don't think the flywheel is the same (approx 1/4 inch deeper?) Can i get a
&gt; regular bus flywheel and bolt it right on to this motor?  thanks.

Yes, that will work.
