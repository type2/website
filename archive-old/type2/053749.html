Folks,

I am heading back to Germany in early August and there is a lot of stuff I have to get rid off before (everything is located in Takoma Park, MD):

'79 Westfalia deluxe, daily driver, totally 
   reliable, new VW muffler, front axle, brakes, etc. 
   $3000
'79 front axle beam, rustfree $150
NOS SWF 72-79 wiper motor, $80
'60-63 40hp stale air mufflers, NOS German $25/each or 
   2 for $40
'63 40hp fresh air muffler, NOS German $25
'79 transmission, some wobble in input shaft but 
   worked fine when pulled, $100
rust free '79 nose (cut through roof and floor) $150
Lots of bits and pieces ('79 bus in boxes) cheap or 
   free to whoever buys the Westy.

Marcus
74 Westfalia Offenbach (in storage in Germany)
79 Westfalia deluxe (daily driver on this side of the pond)
