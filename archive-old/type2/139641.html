Subject: Re: [T2] ba6 heater and the 55 amp alternator.

Guys,

I've been thinking about the 70 amp alternator too and went and looked 
yesterday at the autozone site.

Autozone claims to have one...special order and all, but it is on their 
web site.

So what's up with that?  Ron(BD) doesn't list one, but the bus-boys 
do...are they &quot;really&quot; NLA, or am I just dreaming.....Think I'll call them 
in a few minutes when they open and ask them.

Cheers, dave
