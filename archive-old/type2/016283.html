Subject: t4 manifold icing
References: &lt;199810111827.LAA10091_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

To the list,

Some time back , one of our brethern in the UK replied to a post for
info on the best method to prevent manifold icing problems on a t4
engine that had been converted to a carb from FI.  Whomever it was had
included a supplier and the cost for the gadget, which was a type of
electric pad or cover for the manifold. Would you be so kind as to
repost? Winter is looming and the time for procrastination is gone.
Thanks.
