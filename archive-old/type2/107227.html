Subject: Re: 73 Front End Rebuild

Steve,

Please let me know how you get the torsion arms off. My front axl is off of the 
bus and if I remember correctly everything I've read seems to be a disassembly 
with the axl on the bus. It seems my torsion are under a tremendous load and 
don't want to slip out even with the grub screw removed?
