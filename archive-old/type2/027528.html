&gt;How hard is it to remove ALL the windows on a 1973 bus?? I want to replace 
&gt;it all window seals with new rubber, and new chrome.

Depends on your rubber.  As long as you can get a razor into it and cut it 
it is very easy to remove all the glass.  Just run the razor along the outer 
edge of the glass and cut all the outer rubber off then gently (with two 
people one one each side push along the edges and the glass should come back 
in.

&gt;How good is the reproduction rubber they sell _at_ the Bus Boys or any other 
&gt;source??

Stay away from Brazilan.  I have good and bad luck with both RMMW and 
BusDepot.

&gt;Do I just push from the inside out?? Any &quot;secret&quot; techniques??

Push from the out for tips go to www.type2_dot_com and go to the library their 
are good articles on window installations there.

Good Luck Brother,
