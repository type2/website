Subject: Re: Help needed: Headlight wiring on 1975 bus

Greg Potts writes: 


&gt; There is a thick white wire coming out of the D/S headlight bucket  that 
&gt; leads to the fuse box.  If I connect this wire to a power  
&gt; source it lights up the D/S light only, 

to start off with,, that is correct Greg.
The white wire is for left high beam only.. 

The yellow wire is for right high beam only..
hot wire it.. and the p/s will light... 

and there is 2 more wires.. white with a black strip and yellow with a black 
strip.. they are for the low beams 

They each come from an individual fuse...
when you have the headlight switch on.. you should have power at the 2 
fuse,, when you hit the dimmer.. it will change the power to the other 2 
fuses.. 

I think they are the left most fuses... you should be able to clearly see 
the large wires at the fuse box
