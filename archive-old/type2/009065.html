Well, it's springtime here in the Northeast and time to get Greta 
back on the road for the season.  Which means that she's got to 
pass state inspection... Which means that she's got to have a horn 
that works.  So, has anyone got a steering wheel complete with 
the horn button bits and pieces for a 74 bus?  Also, I'm looking for 
a source for those crank up camper roof vents so as we don't have 
water dripping on our toes whilst sleeping...

Please reply via p-mail to keep list noise down...

Thanks,

John, Patii &amp; Keenan
