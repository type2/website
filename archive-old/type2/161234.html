Subject: Nominal battery voltage

I've heard that auto batteries don't necessarily read exactly 12V due  
to the details of construction in the individual cells. What would be  
considered normal for an FI system? I measured my battery today using  
a DMM with the probes directly on the battery terminals and only saw  
10.6 V. (I've also been troubleshooting other electrical problems in  
the last two months and never saw any static voltage over 11.)

Would anyone see this as a problem? time to get a new battery? Would  
it cause any of the FI components to not work?

Thank you,
Ron J.
