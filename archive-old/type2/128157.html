Subject: Re: [T2] re:  VIN swap (was Jay Leno)

&gt; Maybe, but how much sense does this make? If I
&gt; want to make a kit car 
&gt; Shelby Cobra, I transfer the VIN from a bug.
&gt; What's the difference?

That's usually illegal as well, but it's fairly
technical depending on what all you swap (ie pan
and such).  

If you are building a rail framed vehicle, you
usually are required to apply for a newly
manufactured vehicle title, which will not have a
VIN.  

How much sense does it make?  It makes a lot of
sense to ensure that vehicles aren't stolen or
vehicle fraud isn't committed. 

It's the environmental laws that don't make
sense.
