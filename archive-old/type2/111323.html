&gt;Hmmm, ok, so I live in a state resembling that remark...so they folks

&gt;
&gt;George, Don't forget about those places down in Alabama or Georgia 
&gt;someplace that will get you a title for $xx in less than 30 days.

&gt;&gt; Most of the success stories with registering non-DOT vehicles seem to
&gt;&gt; involve &quot;easy title&quot; states (Arkansas seems to be mentioned a lot) and
&gt;&gt; little, out-of-the-way, DMV offices where the folks are friendly and
&gt;&gt; accommodating and perhaps your cousin.
