&gt; I was under the impression the &quot;map&quot; is defined by the tap locations along
&gt; the pot in the &quot;AFM&quot;


No, that's just one signal, a variable voltage to the ECU depending on where
the vane is positioned.  I guess each ECU for various models/years has a
different &quot;map.&quot;

&gt; &gt;The &quot;ideal 14.7:1 ratio or 0.450 volts&quot; is NOT ideal for air cooled VWs.
&gt; &gt;I try for no greater than 13:1 idle or cruise. Sorry but your guess as to
&gt; &gt;what 13:1 equals on your set up is as good as mine. I would set it at
0.625
&gt; &gt;volts and look at the plugs and exhaust color. Better rich than lean.

&gt; &gt; &gt;While it's true that, for engine longevity, running richer is better
than
&gt; &gt; &gt;running leaner, I'm not sure your practice here has any real affect.
When
&gt; &gt; &gt;the engine's warmed up the ECU looks to run the mixture right around
the
&gt; &gt; &gt;ideal ratio, which is right around .5 volts for a properly functioning
O2
&gt; &gt; &gt;sensor.  So, if you unhook your O2 sensor, fool around with the idle
air
&gt; &gt; &gt;mixture to run &quot;rich&quot; and then reconnect your O2 sensor, I'm not sure
you
&gt; &gt; &gt;accomplish much.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry I thought that this was non closed loop such as a 1977 and Mark was
&gt; using  an Ox detector to set up the open loop air fuel ratio.

You're right about that.  I was thinking of my '81 which has the O2 as
standard equipment.
