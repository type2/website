&gt; Synthetic GL5 doesn't have the bronze synchro-eating chemicals that dino
GL5
&gt; has, so it's fine in your VW transaxle.


2 things I found wrong with using synthetic GL5 in my 77 Westy:

1) the transaxle started leaking from every gasket and seal. It NEVER leaked
a drop with dino GL4.

2) after a 40 mile run up the freeway that synthetic crap expands from the
heat. It would run out the input shaft and leave a 6&quot; diameter puddle after
shutting off the bus and coming back 30 minutes later. After this 1st
happened, my clutch started chattering on take-off. The crap saturated my
new disc.

I flushed that horrible stuff out and put GL4 back in. The leaks and the
puddle from the input shaft stopped. I will have to replace the clutch to
stop the chatter.....
Newer is not always better!
