I am in the process of selling a '71 Westy, I put an web page up and have
been getting inquires far away.  Last week I got a call from a gentleman
&gt;from Ohio -- about 700 miles from here in St. Paul.  After several attempts
to convince him that there must be many nice busses between here and there.
He finally convinced me that he wanted my bus and did not care how far it
was.

So I gave him directions and he said he and his dad would be here Wednesday
morning.  So Tuesday night -- at 10:30 I get a phone call &quot;hey we're 20
minutes away, can we do this tonight&quot;? I said I suppose. So they showed up--
It ran great -- Why shouldn't it new heads and pistons (very few miles on
these) It met his cosmetic needs and he bought it.

I go in the house with a big wod of cash and slightly blue feeling.  This
bus was a project bus and I put a lot of time into it, so I was kind of sad
to see it go.  But, with all that cash I was ready to roll it in to my '72.

At 1:30 in the morning the phone rang -- It was them, the bus could no
longer go over 40 MPH.  I tell them I'll meet them and see if I can do any
thing -- they were about 25 miles away.

It was after 2 am and pouring rain when I got them; this deal has turned
about unpleasant as it could. The engine was hot, old oil was burning off
the bottom (I did not now it was
old at the time).  I pulled the number 3 wire -- made no difference.  If I
had pulled the number 4 wire, I would have found that would have no
difference either ..( 40 MPH on 2 cylinders isn't bad :) ) I am really too
tired to figure out what is up with this thing.

We limp back to my house - it's after 3:00 a.m. by now and still raining.

I gave them their money back and they headed back to Ohio.  I felt sorry for
the guy he traveled so far and was so excited to finally have a van.

The next day, I am awake and can actually think about what happened.  It
took all of 15 minutes to diagnose and another half hour to fix.

I told them they would have to adjust the valves the next morning -- New
heads -- they would tighten up.  Well they did tighten up a little earlier
and tighter than I expected.  After I adjusted the valves it was good as
new.

So Anyhow after I break in the engine -- I will have a '71 Westy for sale.
