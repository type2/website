Yes.

We have a playstation and a vcr, plus a big sound system. Small lcd screen.
The ps2 audio can play through the sound system or through headphones. It is
run from the second battery (stock on our '79). There is no problem with
charging from shore power with the later westy, but I have considered
installing a more modern power converter/inverter than the stock transformer
unit. It is noisy if you are plugged into shore power at night, and it does
not have a built in switch. A modern converter/inverter/charger would be a
very clean solution, it would charge the battery automatically upon plugging
into shore power, as well as providing a powerful inverter, all with clean
power and no transformer hum.

The only thing stopping me from doing this is the cost.
