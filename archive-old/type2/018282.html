Stephen-

Sounds as if you had a rough time of it.  You say that you got a
welder, but you didn't say what type -- MIG, flux core wire welder,
arc, TIG, gas?  MIG is probably the easiest to use but that doesn't
mean you can just fire up the welder and weld something instantly.  A
few hours of practice on something else will help.  Flat hunks of
scrap steel, maybe 1/16&quot; to 1/8&quot; thick and _clean_ are good for
practice.  First just run about 20 feet of weld bead on pieces of
scrap.  Run straight lines.  Write your name in weld bead.  Stuff like
that until the metal goes where you want it to and as much as you want
to go there.  You will use different settings for different
thicknesses of steel.  Then try welding a couple of straight edged
pieces of steel together.  First overlap one on the other and weld
together on both sides.  Then try butt welding -- the edges flat and
about touching each other.  Then try fillet welding -- a T setup where
you are trying to weld the horizontal and vertical hunks to each
other.  You will have to clamp  or otherwise brace the pieces
together, tack weld, then weld up the seam.  The fillet weld is what
you will be using on the flanges, and it is tougher than it looks to
make good ones.   
...
Look for Scrap Metal dealers in your yellow pages.  I pay 25 cents a
pound for good scrap metal, usable sheets and lengths of tubing.  

Flux core wire welding is messier than MIG, but no harder to learn.
If you have gas or TIG, you will be needing at the very least a few
weeks of practice before you can do much.  If you have an arc welder,
you have the wrong tool for this job, sorry to say.  Arc welders are
great for thicker stuff, but muffler tubing isn't thick enough, unless
you are a wizzard with a torch.

Probably the second most important thing is to have an automatically
darkening welding helmet, so you don't have to start the weld 'in the
dark' about where you have pointed the welding gun.  They cost $100
and up, but are worth every penny for anyone who, like me, isn't a
professional weldor.  The lens shields UV and IR radiation 100% of the
time and darkens the visible spectrum in about 1/30,000 of a second --
much faster than you can detect.  When you stop welding, the screen
gets clear again and you can see what you have done.  Thousands of
people have learned to weld without automatically darkening helmets,
but it surely helps most of us.

Cut yourself a little slack, and give your body a few hours of
practice.  It will turn out better.
