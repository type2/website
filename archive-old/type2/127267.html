Subject: RE: [T2] Dim Alternator Light With Headlights On

Alternator lights are triggered by low system voltage. Probable causes of that are:
 
1) Bad Alternator, belt, or VR
2) Large electrical drain (short or bad battery)
3) Old corroded wiring.
4) Bad connections / ground
 
If the battery is 15 years old I will just about guarantee that it is not right. Common failure mode for batteries is to develop an internal short that draws a LOT of charging current. That would explain a dim alternator light, since the alternator is still putting out a lot of current, but voltage is suffering.
 
Measure your system voltage with the engine on. Below 14V indicates a problem.
 
Check out all cells in the batteries. If you run it that way, it might fry the alternator or overheat some wires.
 
Disconnect and clean battery wires and the grounding strap from the tranny to the chasis (is it even there?)
 
#3 is a possibility too, I think my alt light is glows a little on really dark nights. We all have old corroded wires...
