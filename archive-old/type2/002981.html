I'd like to ask for a consensus from the list over whether or not an
overhauled 1600 dual port upright with an brand new old style oil cooler (I
don't think it's a doghouse - crank case is 1965) would have cooling
problems pushing a 1979 Westfalia camper with an average amount of gear,
tools in it (4000lb vehicle weight)?  Could the engine being undersized and
not having a doghouse cooler lead to sure overheat?  All the tin is in place
and engine compartment sealed, timing is right on, and the mixture is not
lean (the system is in perfect working order I verify).  Anyway, I'm not
worrying about it overheating, I'm trying to figure why it is overheating.
I live in south Texas where it gets pretty hot during the summer.  Should I
install an external oil cooler for down here?

Learning, learning, thanks, Christopher
