Subject: Re: Head Torque Question (1600 DP)

Martin,

Let me start with some context: I'm a hobbiest; not a mechanic. I've built
5 or 6 VW engines with varying degrees of success. Some were top-end only.
Some were complete rebuilds. Now for my take on your situation.

The proper way to do it would have been to tighten (without loosening) the
heads in sequence; this is to be done at 300 miles after a rebuild to avoid
the very problem you have encountered. Since you've already loosened the
lower ones, which should only be done independently in an emergency
situation like yours, I think you should loosen all the nuts and then
retorque using the proper sequence. Here's why I think that:

1. The heads are tightened in that special sequence to reduce stress on the
case and get an even torque. They must not be overtightened, as the torque
increases when the engine gets hot and overtorqued nuts result in damaged
or pulled studs or premature cracks in the case.

2. Since you already torqued your lower nuts out of sequence, the *actual*
torque on these may increase above spec when you tighten the upper nuts--it
almost certainly will.

As I understand it, loose heads often result in case or head damage and you
may be looking at another rebuild sooner than you thought. In the worst
situation, you may have stressed the case (by the hammering of the
cylinders) resulting in tiny cracks or the start of cracks. In the best
case, you've done no noticeable damage and you still have many miles left
on the case and heads. I think it's likely that you'll be somewhere in
between--that is, that you'll still have many miles left, but you've
probably reduced the life of your engine.

If I were in your shoes, I'd probably go ahead and pull the heads enough to
slide the cylinder sleeves back a little and inspect the case mating
surface (where it mates to the cylinders); this of course would leave you
subject to oil leaks afterwards, so I'd use some of the non-drying gasket
compound (red) from loctite. I'm not saying this is a *good* idea; it's
just what I think I would try...and I'm a hobbiest, not a mechanic. If the
gasket split when I pulled the cylinders back, I'd try to scrape them off.
If you have to do this, it will reduce your deck height by some small
amount (.006, I *THINK*--measure the gasket with a caliper to be sure), so
make sure you have a tiny bit to spare and if you remove one gasket, remove
them all to maintain an even deck height.

I would be careful not to slide the sleeves back past the rings. Once you
do this, you may as well get new rings and hone those cylinders. At
5-10,000 miles, this is probably a waste of time...unless your heads were
loose enough to impact the geometry of the cylinders/sleeves, in which case
you'll have an out-of-round condition and probably lowered
compression...but I wouldn't worry about that in your situation.

If time isn't important, you could even go so far as to pull the cylinders
and pistons and check the gap between the rods and the crankshaft. If you
know what this gap was when the lower-end was last rebuilt, you can compare
that to the new gaps and determine how much wear has occurred; you could
certainly see how close to spec you are. If you only did a top-end rebuild
last time, you might be money ahead to do the lower-end now, while you've
got the engine out and torn down to the heads. If you already have the
measuring tools, figure on an extra 3-5 days (if this is your first time in
the lower end) and $300 or so (new crank, cam, bearings, oil pump). 2 of
the days should be spent cleaning parts, but will probably be spent staring
at things.

Incidentally, the best book for engine work is neither Bentley, Haynes, or
Muir. It is clearly &quot;How to Rebuild Your Aircooled Volkswagen Engine&quot; by
Tom Wilson--$13 at most bookstores. Highly recommended reading!

Of course, the quick fix is to pull the engine and only retorque the heads.
This is also the easy thing for you and will leave you blissfully ignorant
to the condition of your internals; everything past this step will slow you
down past the Saturday afternoon job of retorquing the heads. If you're
short on money and time, this is probably the approach to take because even
if you tear the engine down completely and rebuild it with brand new parts,
you can't tell how many miles it has left on it; you can only improve or
decrease your own confidence in it. Too bad they don't sell Crystal Balls
as Sears.

Have fun! Joe

&gt;Hi Folks!
&gt;
&gt;I just got back from Central Illinois and boy are my arms tired.  Had
&gt;crosswinds most of the way.  Anyway, while in IL I had an electrical
&gt;problem that I couldn't figure out.  I took it to a local VW mechanic
&gt;that I trust.  He found the problem and fixed it but said that my heads
&gt;were loose.  He was leaving on vacation and didn't have time to do
&gt;anything about them.  He suggested that I pull the valve covers and
&gt;re-torque the four nuts that you can get to that way.  I did this in
&gt;Illinois.  A week later I drove back here to Texas.  Now I plan on
&gt;pulling the engine and re-torquing the heads properly.
&gt;
&gt;That's the question - how do I do this properly?  I have Muir and
&gt;Bentley so I have the diagram for the sequence.  Should I loosen all the
&gt;nuts first and then go through the torque sequence? Or should I just go
&gt;through the sequence with out loosening the nuts?  Or should I do
&gt;something else?  And finally, how often should this be done?  I replaced
&gt;the heads, pistons and cylinders on the engine 5 or 10 thousand miles
&gt;ago.  I think I should have re-torqued the heads before this but is
&gt;there a recommeded interval for this proceedure throughout the life of
&gt;the engine?  Will these questions never end? ;)
