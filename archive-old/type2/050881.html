Subject: Re: [T2] plugs and gaps with CDI

FWIW, the 581 Tiger (which we carry) is wired such that no cutting or
splicing of existing wires must be done. This means you can bypass the CDI
in around 20 seconds if you are slow, and 5 if you are fast. :-)

Carrying a new set of points and condensor in the glovebox (I carry a whole
ready to go distributor in the trunk) is a wise idea with any points
replacement device. Don't forget the mounting screws!
