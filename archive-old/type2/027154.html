Ya, I called them but they don't have any. And I asked if they were from 
Alan Schoefield an they said no. They got some other stuff from them, but I 
guess they used to get the floors from some company in Denmark, but the 
company in Denmark never filled the last order they made over 2 years ago . 
I heard from Kelly that the ones that Alan Schoefield are Brazilian made. 
Would you or anyone on the list know if a Brazilian made floor would fit an 
American bus??
Thanks,
Dave
