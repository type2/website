Subject: Re: [T2] Some basic TypeIV engine help, please]

Also, you can identify which cylinder is bad by keeping the engine
running and pulling plug cables one by one until you reach the cylinder
that doesn't change.  Dunno if it'll help you much, but at least then
you'll have an idea which cylinder is bad.  Then you can check the
valves on that cylinder and hope to be able to adjust it into a workable
state -- a long shot, but worth a try.

&gt; I don't want to deal with this right now, but I guess I have to since she's
&gt; here and has no money.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody have so good &quot;over the internet&quot; diagnosis here?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
