Subject: Re: [T2] Bilbusses? Busboards?

I think you're onto something there.  I checked that vodka link from a few
months ago and thtat's also a bay.
http://www.bostonherald_dot_com/blogs/carBlog/?p=109

Bays also seem to be more prevalent in movies (Little Miss Sunshine, Around
the Bend) about buses than Splitties. (Well, when not animated. ;-))   ..and
of course the Lost fleet. :-D

Seems that major modifications (electric, mobile sound systems) though are
splitties.  I was impressed by a big fiberglass candy machine kiosk in a
mall molded from a bay body.

I have been tempted to volunteer my orange mobile distraction as a billboard
with a tie-on banner greeting the towns main entrance promoting our
community activities (annual city-wide garage sale, car show, outdoor movie
nights, etc.)...but being a small town I haven't needed to bolt-down vandal
points (engine bay, gas tank door) so have used that as an excuse not to let
it sit out away from my house.

Would Raymod Loewy approve?

Happy Friday,

Dean
