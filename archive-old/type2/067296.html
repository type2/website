Subject: Re: Juddering clutch: update

Further information: on rainy days the problem seems to disappear! Can this
point to the hydraulic linkage?

Thank you to the various people who have made suggestions: 5 for the clutch
including the throw out bearing, 2 for engine mountings and 1 for the
clutch cable (in my case its a hydraulic system).

&gt; 
&gt; 1982 Bus (Vanagon), 2.0l air-cooled, 4 speed, 125k miles:
&gt; When you bring up the clutch the whole vehicle shudders. This happens 1st
&gt; and reverse, but also in 2nd. In fact it is easier to reproduce it in
2nd.
&gt; When there are enough revs and take up is slow its OK but when you are
&gt; trying for a quick getaway in 1st or 2nd its more noticeable.
&gt; 
&gt; How do you diagnose whether its a bad clutch or just what happens
normally
&gt; because of the engine mountings?
