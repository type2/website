Subject: 009 Dizzy and my bus update
Message-ID: &lt;3746CDE9.E6B187E3_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hey all,
Thanks so much to all of you have written me with your thoughts on the
009 dizzy in a 2 litre fuel injected bus.  As mentioned in my previous
posts, on monday I beginning my move from Atlanta to Monterey, CA.  I
decided to replace the new 009 with a used but guaranteed original stock
vacuum dizzy.  I was able though the help of a dear friend to located to
in Minneapolis, he overnighted it to me and it just arrived.  So I am
going to swap it out later today, and will hopefully find time to post
here what if any differences I notice.
Thanks again,
Scoob
