Subject: Re: [T2] Flat cam/AVP quality? (longer)

&gt; After purchasing the bus he learned that the engine was a GEX w/solid 
&gt; lifters. :(   A local shop that I have long trusted and bought my first bus 
&gt; from many years ago recommended to change the lifters and pushrods to hyd. 
&gt; lifters. Only a few thousand miles later and several hundred miles away from 
&gt; home his bus began to progressively lose power. In Boise, ID he left the bus 
&gt; 
&gt; Initally our local shop said a flat cam was not the reason. He did a 
&gt; compression test and a leak down test which were both positive. After 
&gt; extensive troubleshooting and checking the entire fuel injection system (new 
&gt; fuel pump because the old one died during testing) deemed it was bad gas and 
&gt; new injectors were needed. However, after the new injectors were installed 
&gt; it was deemed the cam was flat after all. Now my buddy who has little money 
&gt; needs an engine, has another shop bill and still not a healthy running bus.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.   What is the deal with putting hyd. lifters in with a solid lifter cam? 
&gt; Could of these lifters cut into the cam that quickly? Was this a bad idea? 
&gt; Is our shop somehow responsible for killing this engine? (I know GEX history 
&gt; but this engine checked out before the hyd. lifter switch)

GEX has probably driven more VW/people to give up on VW's than any single
group or person (rant off)  I would put the blame first on the folks at
GEX.  check the engine number if it is hyd I would bet GEX never swapped
the cam for a solid cam, so I would suspect (no proof) that the solid
lifters took off the top surface (hardened) of the cam and then it was
just a matter of time no matter what lifters were in there until the cam
died.

it's simple,  hyd cam/hyd lifters or  solid cam/solid lifters

&gt; 2.   How is the quality on AVP? Surely someone on the list has been running 
&gt; one for a while. I would love to hear from folks who have put some miles on 
&gt; an AVP rebuild.

I have AVP heads I got from Ron at Bus Depot and they seem fine, haven't
had them that long though
&gt; 
&gt; 3.    What would you do if this were your bus? My buddy keeps asking me how 
&gt; much he could get if he parted out his bus. :(

BTDT, bit the bullet and put $2500 into a decent rebuild,  40,000 miles
later (or so) the engine is giving me no trouble.  

I would not part out an otherwise good bus, 

good luck to your friend
