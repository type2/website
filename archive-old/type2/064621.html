Well... that makes your van worth somewhere between $7K and $11K, 
doesn't it? From the description, I'd say closer to the latter price. It 
must be reassuring to know you can get your money back, if you decide to 
sell... and can find anyone who'll pay those prices.

BTW, I'd like to shake the hand for anyone who'd pay &gt; $10K for some of 
these vans.
