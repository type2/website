&gt; A heavy-duty rear bumper with trailer hitch engineered from heavy duty
&gt; steel.  Not the prettiest thing, but with some paint it could be made to
&gt; look decent.  This was on my bus ('74) when I got it, but I didn't need
&gt; or like it and so now it sits in the backyard holding down the firewood
&gt; tarp.  P-mail me for pic.
&gt; 
&gt; In Portland, Oregon; must be picked up.
