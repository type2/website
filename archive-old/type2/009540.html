On 5/25/99 12:18 PM, dannymk_at_hotmail_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;The next door neighbor's, while out of town, left their son home to fend for
&gt;himself.  Part of that seemed to include his Chevy S-10 rolling backwards
&gt;down the driveway, across the street and into my '75 kombi stationwagen.
&gt;I've had it parked for a few months with a for sale sign on it.  It needs a
&gt;full rebuild for which I don't have the space/money to do this.  My Riviera
&gt;camper is my daily driver now.

Bummer. I have exactly the opposite problem-like a real dufus I didn't 
leave the bus in gear on my driveway, and the handbrake didn't hold. 
Damned thing rolled across the street and nailed my neighbors truck. Did 
more damage to my bus though, bent up his bumpers, but his bumper hit my 
left rear taillight, and the sheet metal tore. Real bummer, happening to 
my new bus, only about 1 week after I get it home. Oh well, I can fix 
it...

Like Unca Joel once told me he learned in the Army-s**t happens, and 
sometimes you're there when it does...
