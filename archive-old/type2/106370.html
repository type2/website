Subject: A little &quot;engine assembly&quot; help, please

Hi all:

I'm finally getting around to building out an engine I last worked on 3-4
years ago when I finished the basic assembly then wrapped it up for &quot;later.&quot;

The Bentley manual on 13.6 shows what looks to be an O-ring that goes behind
the Cooling Fan Hub, but doesn't specifically identify it.  The ETKA, on
Illustration 13-00 also shows this O-ring and identifies it as


 Part Number           Name         Remarks
* 021 119 125A    round seal     28x3

It's been such a long time since I tore this engine down I don't remember
seeing this seal, and the engine I just tore down to get the external parts
for the &quot;new&quot; engine didn't have one.  I dug through the gasket kit bag and
came up with a black O-ring that slides over the crank, fitting the crank
&quot;nicely&quot;, i.e., not &quot;tight&quot; and not &quot;sloppy.&quot;  I'm guessing this is the
right seal, but I'm just not sure.  Any one with recent contact with this
seal that can characterize how it fits on the crank?  Or, can any one tell
me what the &quot;28x3&quot; remark is telling me, so I can measure the one I've got
and see it I've got it right?

TIA.
