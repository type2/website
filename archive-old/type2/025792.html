When my 77 FI did the bucking thing, it was because of one of the two
problems, (as I fixed them at the same time I don't know for sure)  My AFM
was shot so I replaced that but I noticed when I was doing this that one of
the many contacts in the control unit (often referred to as the brain) was
bent and not making contact with it's female receptacle.  So, I would first
check the contacts of all those little connectors in the control unit and
then troubleshoot the AFM according to the archives or the FI section of the
T2 library.
Hope that helps
