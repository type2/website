Subject: RE: [T2] Tsunami Victims - interesting info, take it for what
  it's  worth.

35 million is allot don't you think...

But if Bill Gates would like to give me 5k to buy a new bay.... What
difference would it make to him...

Maybe the U.N Folks were talking about the % of help fund that the U.S
give vs. the money they make.

But eh! I'm Canadian.... I support the U.N 100%
