Subject: Anybody need any Big Freakin' Carbs[tm]?

When I bought Spike ('74 Bus), he came with a couple of spare parts.  OK, 
he actually came with an entire engine.  The PO explained that the extra 
was a &quot;performance&quot; engine that he had installed and used for a while, 
but compression had dropped on one cylinder, and he had put the original 
engine back in.

I'm going to preface this by saying that I do not know fuel systems 
(especially on carbed engines) and have no particular interest in 
having a &quot;fast&quot; bus.  (It's already faster than my diesels ever were. :) )
When I had my old Kombi (a '67), the extent of my diagnostic skills were 
&quot;jiggle everything around and try to start it again&quot;.  I'm learning how 
all of this works bit by bit, so bear with me if I don't get everything 
right.  Here's what I know from memory:

The carbs are the largest I have ever seen.  There are a pair, one for
each side of the engine.  They each have two very large ports (2.5-3cm, if
memory serves) on top.  They're made by an italian company, and have a
code number on the side (which is written on a piece of paper I left on my
kitchen table..grrr.) The PO was very hesitant to part with them, though 
I'm not sure why.

If there's any interest, I can post (or forward on individually) the 
information on the carbs.  If there's anyone local to the rochester.ny_dot_us 
area, I'd be willing to bring them by if you'd be willing to take a look 
and tell me what you think they're worth, even if you're not interested 
in them yourself.  Besides, it would be cool to meet up with some other 
area bus owners.

The point of this whole thing is that I'd be willing to part with them 
for a bit of cash or maybe trade them off for a few parts.  I might even 
be willing to part with the extra engine, since I don't really have a good 
place to keep it.  Besides, my contract is up Aug. 13 and after that I'm 
unemployed, so my bus supply funds (hell, my food supply funds) are going 
to be a bit tight by the end of the month.  

Let me know if anyone is interested...

        - Tom
