Yup, 'tis..and you can buy a pancake breakfast from the boy scouts on both 
days..

&gt;Jan &amp; I are taking a trip to Erwin TN from Cupertino Ca,

If you'll be in Erwin for more than a few days, p-mail me..as we live about 
20 miles south in NC..and have our 8th annual pig pit-roast scheduled the 
following Saturday...or don't they eat pigs in Cupertino?...
