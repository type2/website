Subject: Re: Stripped Threads, oil drain plate

Some may balk at this but if you clean the hole REALLY well. Spray your
screw with a light coating of silicone. Then put some JBWeld in the hole and
carefully screw in the screw.

You must do this without the plate in place in order to get the threads deep
enough.

Once the JBWeld hardens back out the screw and you have new threads.

The JBWeld is strong enough to hold as long as you don't tighten the screw
past the recommended torque and it will take temps up to 600F.

You have nothing to lose by trying it except a half hour of your time and a
few bucks for the JBWeld.
