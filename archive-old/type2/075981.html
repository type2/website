Billy sends:

&gt; I'm 10 minutes from CB perfomance. Should I have them split this case to
&gt; inspect cam/crank/innerds? Anyone ever used them for this with a t4?

Yes, definitely, and not just for inspection purposes.

The inside of that case needs to be clean enough to eat off of before you
put it back together. You will not get it that clean if you don't split it.
Yes, you might be able to get it &quot;clean enough&quot; without splitting it, but
like my drill sergeant said, there's a difference between good and &quot;good
enough.&quot;

I also like to change the main and cam bearings, and if you don't split it
you can't.
