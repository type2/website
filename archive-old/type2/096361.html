Subject: Re: [T2] torque converter swap.

I think I have it figured out but before I try this, has anyone tried
swapping out a torque converter WITHOUT dropping the engine. 
  measuring says I can just have enough room to slide the engine straight
back take out one of the engine mount studs and drop the converter and
slide the new one in.  OK I'm being ??? but I just don't feel like lifting
that heavy 2liter engine in and out, also I wouldn't have to disconect a
lot of the little stuff like wires and vacuum lines.  I could build a crib
for the engine to lay on while doing this.  

have I really gone round the bend on this one or is this remotely
possible??

thanks
Bob
