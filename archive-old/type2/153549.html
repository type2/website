Subject: RE: [T2] VW Type2 on XBox 360

I have played all version of Gran Turismo and am currently working on
A-Spec, which does have the new beetle in it.  None of the versions have
anything reassembling a type2 though.  Gran Turismo is PlayStation only
anyways.

I am not a gamer either myself, but I do hang out with a few..
The only game I am aware of that has a VW in it, is Gran Turismo 3.   It has
a few  &quot;new school&quot; VW's,  as well as a  mid-60s  beetle (I forget the exact
year, not sure if they even give one.)
I am not aware of any games with Buses in them tho..
