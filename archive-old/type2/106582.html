Subject: good guys to work with

Hey List,

I just got a set of retractable seat belts for a friends bus - I have 
them in mine already.

Got them from Way Out Salvage in AR.  These guys are very friendly and 
knowledgeable about VW.  They also seem to have lots to good used parts.

Check out their web site and call 'em if you need anything.
