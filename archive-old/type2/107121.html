Subject: two annoying electrical problems.

 If there is anything I HATE, I mean really despise its weird electrical
problems. Nothing makes my head hurt faster then the thought of unwinding
the spaghetti under my dash. I am also really bad at electrical issues. So
of course there are two on the bus that slipped by my inspection.

The first is the LR taillight assembly. All the lights on it are dimmer
then the RR taillights. AND when you have the Left turn signal on and you
hit the breaks, the left turn signal quits flashing. I checked the
connections at the lights and at the brake booster (cleaning as I went). No
luck. My next thought is to check the LR ground wire, thinking that the
ground wire is some thing that the LR turn signal, brake light and,
taillight all have in common. Beyond that I have no idea where to look. 

The second problem is that the Right high beam works, but low beam doesn't.
I put a new bulb in, same MO. I switched the bulbs, and still the right low
beam is not working. The connection at the bulb seems ok, the wires looks
all right from the plug to where they go behind the fuse box. I am guessing
the next move here is to pull the fuse box and see if the low beam wire has
slipped its connection. My first question here is that there are three
wires to the plug brown (ground) white w/dark stripe and yellow with  dark
stripe. whish of the latter two is the low beam? and if the wire is
connected into the fuse box, what else should I look for?

Other then that, the car seems well cared for, all the grease points are
greasy the heat even works, drives well. the PO couldn't get the
progressive working so he swapped it for a pair of weber 40's. They seem to
do the trick.
