Subject: Problem with dealership service? Who to contact?

Hey folks...

Fairly off topic for most of you, but I do this to get the word out....all
replies to keen_at_polaris.digital-galaxy_dot_net, and not to the lists (except
specificly where such replies would be on topic!)

Mom's 84 TD jetta got to the point where it would NOT start cold. So
i posted the probelm to the diesel list, and the overwhelming response was
that the injection timing was off.

Since I was not equiped to really check such a thing, nor did I really
have the time, we opted to take it the dealership.  Asked them to check
and adjust the timing, and if it needed it, to replace the timing belt
while they were at it.

The next day, the called us, &quot;It's ready!&quot; they said.  We asked when we
picked it up if they had test driven it, and tried to start it when hot.
They said yes, and it was working fine now.


Mom drove it home.  Stopped by walmart on the way.  When she got home, she
said it just BARELY started outside of walmart. she'd been in ~ half an
hour.

Note:  this vehicle has NO trouble starting cold.  Vrrrm!

So, the next day, Sunday, I checked it out.  Opened the hood, and found
that the timing cover was installed improperly. It was rubbing against the
AC/water pump belt. Also noted that the alternator belt had been
tightened, but was badly in need of replacement, due to being worn too
thin, and full of cracks!

Our reciepts clearly showed where they had charged us to replace the
timing belt, valve cover gasket, adjust injecting timing, and adjust all
belts.  Total?  381.15

The injection pump timing plug (that is removed to insert a dial indicator
to check timing), nor the bellhousing plug (removed to see the TDC
pointer..) had any wrench marks at all. (this engien is not clean, but not
greasy.  Hit it with a wrench, and the dirt is displaced, though..)

Took it back the next day, and went straight to the service manger.
Showed him the timing cover, and he immediatly was apologetic.  Attempted
to point out other things, like it still not starting when hot, etc, but
he was much more interested in trying to get us out of there.
Also told them to replace the bad alternator belt.

Took them 3 days this time. Said they had to order a belt for it. Took it
home, and it STILL is not starting when hot.  Second charge of 88.50 
reciept stating adjustment and replacement of belts.  Note that belts
needed to be removed and reinstalled to change the timing belt..


I make the descision to attempt to tool up for the job of setting the
injection pump timing myself, since we really dont trust that they have
done it.  Car sits for 2-3 weeks while I put the cash togethor for the
dial indicator and appropriate base, and point set.


Tools showed up friday, so today I pulled the car in my shop, and started
to work.

Removed air cleaner assembly, timing cover, et al.  Immediately noted that
the timing belt WAS NOT NEW.  Same belt, same tensioner.  How do I know it
was the same belt?  When I installed the cover (PO lost it when .he.
installed the generic brand belt), it rubbed the belt when I started the
car up.  Removed, and had to shim the front (FIF) of the cover to keep it
from rubbing.  So the belt has no VW markings, numbers, etc, is clearly
NOT new, AND has the same rub mark along the edge.


Continuing along, i remove the valve cover (according to the Bentley, the
only was yo tell you are at TDC for #1 is to line up the TDC mark on the
flywheel and look to be sure #1's valve were both shut.  Afterthought
shows I probably could have looked through the oil fill hole and seen the
rocker arms...  Gasket does not appear to be only a few weeks old. Nor
did the hoses from the air filter housing to the turbo, and the valve
cover appear to have been disturbed.

With the flywheel at the TDC mark, and #1 valves both shut, the injection
pump sprocket has a notch that should line up with the notch on the pump's
mounting plate.  the notch on the sprocket is around 1/4&quot; to the
rear (FIF) of where it should be.  the Bentley states that if the
injection pump sprocket is not timed correctly, the pump CANNOT be timed
correctly (done by loosening the pump mounting bolts, and moving it one
direction or the other).

This should have been corrected to adjust the timing, even if they did
NOT plan on replacing the belt.


I've not yet measured the current timing setting, as I found the base I
thought would work won't.  something about magnets not sticking to
aluminum heads!:)  Tomorrow, I'll have a machine shop fabricate what I
shall need.


We will be in contact with the owner of the dealership tomorrow, since the
management of the serive department didnt want to take care if it.

After that, I guess we contact VWoA.

The dealership in question is Gerald Jones VW/Audi/Volvo, in Augusta, GA.

I'm sending this to the Typ3, typ2, vintagebus, vwdiesel, Aircldvw,
Vanagon, and vintagvw mailing lists.  If I could find an email address for
VW of A, or VW aG, I'd cc: to them also.  The dealership does not have an
email, or website.

A copy of this will be shown to the owner of the dealership tomorrow,
also.

thanks for reading, and not shooting me for being so long winded, yet off
topic.

....david
