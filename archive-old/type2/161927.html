Subject: Re: [T2] Am I outta my fricken mind?

I guess I am 'cause I bought the damn thing. I pick it up on Thursday. Like
waiting for your first baby to come home from the hospital.

Maybe not. ;)

But I am pumped, and I need to start the learning curve for 40-year-old
trucks. First thing is of course safety. These things burn up, and what is
the cause of it? On the T3's it's all those damned short little hi-pressure
fuel injection hoses. I noticed on a photo the guy sent me that the fuel
hose and filter in the engine compartment looks like a paleoamerican
artifact, so that is is coming off the minute title changes hands. But what
other sources of colossal bangs should I look for? I intend to drive it the
two hours or so home (including the Nanaimo ferry, which should potentially
be fun: watch the new Thursday night). He has collector plates on it and he
doubts he's driven it 1000K in 4 years. What other things could possibly
leave me stranded on the ferry onramp?

Nathaniel
