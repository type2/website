Subject: Re: turn signal signals

&gt;I am also curious - if both indicator lights on a 70 flash in unison,
&gt;regardless of whether left or right is selected, are there years where the
&gt;dash indicators correspond ONLY to the direction you plan to go?

Good question. Both lights on my 73 flash in unison and I was wondering that
myself.
BTW, the relay order... I was wrong... correct order = Closest to drive (turn),
Second over (lights), far passenger side I would assume is the buzzer
(although Ive never had a buzzer).

I can manually click my lights from hi-lo by pushing the relay. I will get a
new relay on Monday... not very many places open on Saturday that carry
VeeDub parts.
