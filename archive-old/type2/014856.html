&lt;&lt; I have a Coleman Inflatall 150, &gt;&gt;

Any idea who actually makes these? As with most of the &quot;branding&quot;
going on now - I have a K-Mart insulated shirt that has a &quot;Coleman&quot;
label - I wonder if these aren't just overseas manufactured and the
end of the assembly line adds the appropriate label. Not just this in-
flator, mind you, but lots of other goods, cheaply made with a well-
known/recognized name added. I have Rigid plumbing tools and e-
quipment that has served me for ten or fifteen years and I got 'em
used; the name has been tacked on a really shoddy line of wood-
working equipment that Home Depot shills...Sad that the &quot;quality&quot;
that was inherent in a &quot;name&quot; is so easily sold off (Paging Esau...)
today. Craftsman is another brand that has gone the way of the
bottom line...My '48 Craftsman bandsaw is still ticking, but I ser-
iously doubt if the current models will outlast one big project. Even
Mercedes-Benz is not immune...The M-series is rapidly approaching
Chrysler-like numbers in defects...
