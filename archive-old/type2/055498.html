Subject: Re: Where do you work on your VW?

-&gt;I've found that, with the back hatch open to provide 
-&gt;a workspace in the &quot;cargo area,&quot; I can do most jobs efficiently, if not 
-&gt;in comfort.

And for those of you in rainy (snowy) climates, or direct sunlight, a
few of thost big spring clips and one or two tarps attatched to the
open rear hatch are a god-send.  Just about anywhere you can find
scrap to weigh down the &quot;ground&quot; ends of the tarp to keep it from
whipping around.  I keep a 1-1/2 X 3 foot piece of plywood and some
scrap foam around to kneel on in my new &quot;dry/shady&quot; space. 

Thin army surplus wool gloves are can make a hug difference if you are
going to be outside for a while.  

take care,
	brandy
