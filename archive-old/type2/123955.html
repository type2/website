Subject: RE: [T2] she's bleeding!

Easy to fix, get a bunch of good oil change gasket kits. They contain
two paper/fiber gaskets, the acorn nut brass washer and the center plug
crush ring.
Drian oil by removing plate or taking center drain plug out if the plate
has one. Then remove the acron nuts, drop plate. Carefully remvoe
strainer. Then clean the parts in solvent, the plate and the strainer,
dry in air or compressed air and/or towels.
Clean area the gaskets and strainer live in, with clean rag.
Then install like this:
Engine,
Paper gasket,
Stainer,
Paper gasket,
Plate,
New washers,
Acorn nuts,
New crush ring,
Drain plug (if you have one, some engines don't),
Torque to reasonable specs in star pattern.,
Then torque drain plug.,
DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN.,
Fill with oil,
Cheack for leaks, tighten a little more if you have to, but don't over
tighten! Bentley or a knowledgeable listee will fill in torque values,
but if you just keep it sensible you will be fine with a clean surface
and a straight stainer.,

Make sure strainer is not broken at the rivet, and it should have a
spring in it.,

Hope that helps.

My 70 Campmobile hadn't leaked a drop of oil until i took it in for a
tune 
up about 2 weeks ago. While there i had them change the oil, and now i
am 
bleeding oil. Added up i think it has dropped about a quart. The
dipstick is 
still on full, and she is leaking right in front of the oil strainer
cover. 
Is this somthing i need to worry about? and if so, what gaskets might
need 
to be replaced? I am kinda looking forward to dropping the engine out of
her 
anyway...Gotta learn sometime :)
