Said Dave:

&gt;     And if you're going to put a lot of bass in your car, and drive around with
&gt; it bumping, please please please, fix the rattles.  Nothing is more annoying
&gt; than a car who's doors rattle when the radio's on.  And it makes you look like
&gt; a total dork.

Dude!  That's the whole point of superthumpin' bass, man!  Especially if
you can get those long beltline trim strips to rattle at stoplights.  If
you got no rattles, MAKE SOME!  Yo, how else will people know you have a
killer system?

And sit real low in the seat, your head to one side, elbow way out the
window.  You're *way* too cool to drive from a comfortable and efficient
position!

Geez, I have to keep after you guys or you'll lose your hipness
altogether.
