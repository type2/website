Subject: RE: Short Shocking Shocks

	Richard, and List...

	4 inches short!  Wow!  I've KYBs that were about 1/4&quot; too short to
use on '72-up, T4 equipped buses, due to a slight spec change to the rear
suspension (Karl can weigh in here...  paging Karl?)...  Early Bays with T1
power don't appear to suffer this problem.

	Because of tired torsion bars aka &quot;Saggy B*tt Syndrome&quot;, the usual
white KYB supplied don't make no nevermind for lots of volk, and lots will
never know until t-bars are re-adjusted...  

	The reasonable cure is to use the GR-2s from the 80s Ch*vy
*str*-v*n, they have metric bolt-holes and everthang - I don't have the KYB
p/n handy unfortunately.  The tech-spec desk at KYB clued me in to this, as
the VW-specific vendors and the apps desk at KYB didn't know their *sses
from a h*t r*ck on the problem.  The tech-spec desk guy very SPECIFICALLY
said NOT to use the white KYB *str*-v*n shock - the GR-2 innard specs were
perfectly matched to the bus suspension characteristics.  The GR-2s have an
internal buffer, and the white KYBs don't - which means that when your
spring plates head toward the lower spring plate stop - the white KYB
innards become your new lower suspension stop...  and that's gonna leave a
mark ;-)
