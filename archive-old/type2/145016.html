&gt; Let's just face that VW buses are not safe and especially if the brakes are

Well said.  No vehicle is safe, but the utility of the VW bus comes with
compromises that eliminate the &quot;cocoon&quot; of crush zone enjoyed by
more modern car

The most important safety component in a bus is the nut that holds the
steering wheel.
