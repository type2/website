Subject: Re: [T2] replying to messages

Just delete the quoted material (including the unsubscribe info at the 
bottom of every message).  The list admins just want to keep message 
sizes down.  If you noticed, I chopped off part of your original message 
so the type2 listserv wouldn't yell at me..
