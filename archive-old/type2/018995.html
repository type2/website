Ya mean I could get 93 octane somewhere for my bus?  

While in Canada this summer we found 2 Chevron stations that sold
straight  *94* octane.  My bus didn't get too much better gas mileage,
but boy, oh BOY did it run nice!  It's a '71 with a stock 1600 in it,
and with the load we were carrying, it needed all the help it could get!

&gt; &gt;I got a quick simple question about fuel octane.
&gt; &gt;  when your tank is half full of 87, and you add the other half full with 89,
&gt; &gt;does it all mix and make 88, or will the gas have a natural tendencie to stay
&gt; &gt;seperate?
&gt; 
&gt; They mix.  In fact, when you get mid-grade 89 at the pump (at least in
&gt; Texas, not sure about other places), what you are actually getting is a
&gt; mixture of 87 and 93 octane gas.  The pump just pulls from both tanks, at a
&gt; specific ratio (two to one in this case).  The gas stations don't want to
&gt; have to produce, ship, and store three kinds of gas when they only really
&gt; have to handle two, you see.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't know this until one day when I was filling up with 89 and the gas
&gt; was coming out real slow.  Reason being they were out of 87, which meant
&gt; that I was getting straight 93 octane gas but only paying for 89.  Needless
&gt; to say, I didn't mind waiting a few extra minutes for the tank to fill.  :)
