&gt; &lt;&lt; Ok, how bout this: Drive or otherwise transport us spec
&gt; bus to wherever a used diesel bus can be found. Remove
&gt; all numberplates etc from us spec bus and affix
&gt; to &quot;foreign&quot; bus and drive it home.

Bad news is that if Customs figures out what you are doing (and they see
Mexibuses every day) they will confiscate your new bus, perhaps clap you
in the pokey, and levy hefty fines.  I wouldn't fiddle with these folks.

Oddly, new &quot;antique&quot; airplanes are often built with the manufacurers data
plate as the only original part.  The difference between fraud and legal
restoration is often the money involved.
