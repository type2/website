&lt;&lt; The question is....I have a 74 bus with two stripped, damaged lug bolts on 
the rear driver side.  What can I do to get them off...
I have tried WD-40, I tried using a 19mm socket, I purchased a 4 ft. piece of 
galvanized steel to add weight and leverage, I have tried hitting it with a 
hammer....I went out and purchased a 2 lb hammer, As a last resort I have 
taken to trying to chisel the bolts off....NOTHING IS WORKING!! &gt;&gt;

Are we trying to get the lug bolts or nuts off? The lug BOLTS are pressed
into the rear wheel hub through a splined hole from the inside. The NUTS
(even if rounded off) can be loosened with an E-Z OFF socket hammered
on and turned with an impact wrench or breaker bar and pipe extension.
E-Z OFF sockets and sets (GREAT for salvage shopping) are available
from MSC Ind. Supply Co. &lt;www.mscdirect_dot_com&gt;
If you've got a PC, they'll send you a CD-ROM. If you've got a Mac, ask
for the paper catalog. In the catalog, the sockets are on page 1397
(big book).
