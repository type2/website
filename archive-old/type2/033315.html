&gt; &gt; 185 x .78 = 144.3
&gt; &gt; 195 x .75 = 146.25
&gt; 
&gt; Problem with this is that the aspect ratio of the 185R14 is 0.82, not
&gt; 0.78

I read a few places that it was .78 when i was researching the
issue..never saw a reference to .82..oh well.

&gt; 185 x .82 = 151.7


&gt; Do 603s come in 195/75?  I didn't know that!

Sure do.  Load D too.  I dont have the specs on hand, as it is cold
outside...if you want i might look tomororw.;)

I still dont like them, but they handle better then i expected, they
actually do ok in the rain.  Not as well as a'd like, but they work.

But loose sand/dirt/gravel or mud?  Absolutely terrible.  Havent seen any
snow or ice, so i cant say there.

At 8$ more then Y370s each (both from the tire rack. yes, the 370 is
still available, there were 5 sitting in erics living room yesterday..now
on his bus) (57 vs 65, iirc) i would highly recommend the 370 if you do
anything more then highway driving...


&gt; The difference in running is probably small, but I'd just as soon see
&gt; people get the correct size, so that the correct size will continue to
&gt; be produced.  Folks in Europe might have better supply, since it is
&gt; used on several makes of minivan there, but the last vehicle using this

Good point.  If i could get a decent rain tire in 185R14D i would
certianly buy it.;)  Preferably a modest AT tire.;)

later...david
