Subject: Cyl Head temperature Sensors

Hey guys, yet another question...

	I purchased a book called &quot;How to rebuild your air cooled Volkswagen
engine&quot; or something, and it mentioned that some cyl heads had actual tapped
holes that allow you to bolt in the cyl head temperature sensors. Rather
than pulling apart my heat tins or whatever they're called... can someone
tell me.. do ALL 1.8s have the cyl head temperature sensor holes? 


Thanks,
