&gt; Anybody know where I can find the black rubber floor covering material
&gt; that is on the seat supports.  It runs along by the sides of the seats
&gt; and around the front of them.


I have them on my website on the interior parts page.  You need two part
numbers to do the whole job (both seats), quantity one each of 211 863  665B
at $39.95 and 211 867 765A  at $44.95  Remember to ask for your 5%
listmember discount when ordering.
