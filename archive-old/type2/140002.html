Subject: Re: [T2] Timesert or helicoil

Hello Guys  this depends on if motor is in the bus or not   If you can get in 
to it I use a heil coil,   seeing that you have to be able to remove the tang 
at the bottom of the heil coil,  on bugs there isnt enough room to do a heil 
coil    Timeserts or the KD inserts will work but are bigger than heil coils 
so you would have one less chance to repair the head   later and have fun  mark 
dearing
