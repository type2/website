Subject: Re: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

&gt; This brings up two questions I am still wondering about....I know the bus
&gt; lists the tire pressure at around 35 psi and it has been stated that we
&gt; should go by the manufacture's suggested pressure and not what a tire can
&gt; handle (65 psi max for example), but does that consider the actual tires
&gt; they used back then or is that strictly what a bus should be running
&gt; regardless of technology and what tire is used? Should I run something like
&gt; 45 psi with a stiffer tire to make sure it's not underinflated?

rob
each tire has its own charactaristics of load vs pressure.
the max pressure would give you the correct tread on the road only at the
max load (or in the neighborhood)

If you run these tires at max pressure you will find the response very
squirrly and the center of the tires will wear out prematurely. and it
will make driving dangerous.


as an example. ford explorer and firestone. they specified too low a
pressure and boom. bad stuff.
