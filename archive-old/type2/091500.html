Subject: Ben's Carbs

Volks,

I am out of my depth.  I started on Ben's problems as ignition and timing,
which are broadly applicable and have little to do with the way fuel is
supplied.  That I could handle.  It has drifted thru vacuum (which I know)
towards carbs (which I *don't* know) and now I am out of my depth.

My carb bus experience is limited to driving a single ?Weber? installed on
a '79 for a week and driving Nikki's '73 wiht the stock dual carbs from
Atlanta to Greensboro.  Nikki's dual carbs had their share of problems...
the shutoff solenoid in the &quot;third carb&quot; fell out and the boots for the
disc brake booster got blown off in a backfire, but mostly it ran strong
and smooth.  The single carb ran &lt;euphemism&gt; very badly &lt;/euphemism&gt; due
to carb icing here in the mid-atlantic area.  I will never recommend that
conversion to anyone not living in a desert.

I know there have to be stock rebuilders and aftermarket solutions in the
single and dual carbs.  Anyone got an opinion? Recommendations of someone
who does a *good* job of rebuilding the stock carbs? (*really* clean and
new throttle shaft bushings)

In addition, I am headed for Las Vegas (family thing) tomorrow and will be
offline 'til Tuesday.  Y'all have a good weekend!!!!
