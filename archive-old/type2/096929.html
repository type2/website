Subject: Mt Washington Auto Road

Dear Don:

I've driven a numkber of cars on that road through the years raning 
from a Porsche 914, a Triump Spitfire, Fiat whatchamacallit and a new 
(at the time) 83 Toyota Corrolla.   All overheated or almost did and 
every one needed an oil change almost right after.

Were I still living there,  I'd park the bus and take the Cog 
Railway.   I guess I've worked too hard to get this machine going and 
at 25 years of age it iis very maintenance intensive.  I want to save 
it for nice camping trips.   I think you'd be putting unnecessary 
wear and tear on an old engine to do this.

My 2¢!
