Subject: 215,500mi engine passes inspection!

Pulled up to NJ inspection this morning (been 2 years; we are on an even
year system for the 78 Westy), and they put the old guy (looked 60) on
to drive test the Westy!  It was marked down as a Vanagon- only class
they could find for it!  For busses this old, they only do a tailpipe
test; the CO just passed (280, 300 allowed) and rest was fine.
The good news- passed completely after 2 years since previous inspection
(78, we are on even years in NJ).  Considering my somewhat wandering
front end (swing lever has some play), I was more worried about this
plate they drive it on which VIBRATES- I guess the ball joints passed!
     I tuned up this bus yesterday and did a compression test; #1 was
only 100, came up to 130 with oil.  The never rebuilt engine is getting
tired rings?  Since this may be overheating from a mild manifold leak,
I'll check the valve clearance (free play on hydraulic lifter) soon. 
Other cylinders were in 140-150 range.  A year ago #1 was 130, came up
to 135 with oil when all the others jumped to 160 from about 140. 
Sounds fine, is OK on highway, gotta take it easy on hills.  I expected
this engine to throw a rod bearing or something before the heads fail-
and didn't want to deal with the manifold connection because I expected
a rebuild 50K ago!!  .......now lets take bets on the milage when it
fails and what will happen??
