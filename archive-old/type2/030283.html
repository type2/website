&gt; I thought &quot;staking&quot; is called &quot;peening&quot;??

I think of &quot;peening&quot; as a process applied to an area of a surface, such as
&quot;shot-peening&quot;.  &quot;Staking&quot; is applied to specific locations to displace
metal in order to hold another object in place.  For example, the &quot;dime&quot;
on solex carburators is staked in place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Can someone please define the word swaged for me??
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is that the same thing as using a punch like tool to push heated metal over
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the edge of the valve seat?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The proper term for this is &quot;staking&quot;.  &quot;Swedging&quot; is compressing a metal sleeve onto a cable or somesuch, such as the throttle cable end.
