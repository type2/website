Subject: [ADMIN] Re: unsubscribe

Volks,

After three of these in a row I'm sensing a problem.  Notice that the 
message below, which like every other message that is posted to the type2 
list, contains instructions on how to unsubscribe right at the bottom of 
the message.  Somehow, seeing the instructions 40 times a day apparently is 
not enough for some, so I will reiterate:

DO NOT SEND UNSUBSCRIBE MESSAGES TO THE LIST.

Doing so, as stated in the charter, will remove you from the type2 list and 
add you to the Other list, the list of people who will Not be back, when 
they return from vacation or reinstall Windows or get their cable modem 
installed.  Sorry to be so grouchy about it but in order for this list to 
survive we all have to follow a few simple guidelines, and the above is one 
of them.  Can you imagine checking your mail, getting 50 messages and 14 of 
them are from people simply letting all 1,000 of us know that they are 
unsubscribing?  Can you imagine searching the type2 archives for nice 
places to drive your bus on VACATION and pulling up message after message 
like the one below?  Please, take a moment to re-read the charter at 
http://type2_dot_com/type2charter.html and make sure you post only legitimate 
bus content.  Thanks.
