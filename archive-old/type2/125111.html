Subject: Wow thanks re super fast access to rear instrument cluster

RE:
insturment cluster rear access from front via turn signal lens
hole

I too have the AC stuff blocking my easy access. I am going to try
that right away. I hate removing the instruments to replace a
light bulb or mess with wiring, etc. It is always risky to remove
the heat, defrost, and vent levers. Your approach will save me a
lot of time. I need to replace some instrument cluster night
illumination bulbs now. It is such a PITA that I always wait until
the last bulb burns out.

thank you thank you thank you

I may, however, change your approach slightly.

I don't like sheet metal screws for regular R&amp;R.

you eventually have to change to larger screws because they losen
up.

I am going to use &quot;well nuts&quot;

these are really neat &quot;permanent&quot; gizmos that provide regular
female machine threaded screw holes in thin sheet metal. Many
factory roof racks are installed using this type of &quot;screw hole&quot; .
You just drill a precisely sized hole and push the correct rubber
well-nut in with your finger. If you do use the well-nuts or a
similar product for a critical structure like a roof rack, you
must be sure that you have used enough well-nuts to produce a
secure and safe system that will not blow off in the wind or break
off with a jack-rabbit start or an emergency sudden stop. Some
well-nut like products are more secure than others and provide a
stronger attachment using an expansion plug type grip hold.
