&gt;I'm going to make a shameless plug for Nikki's stuff at this moment.

I'm going to do it again, she also has the Sanford and Son theme on
the page, that made me laugh my but off as I haven't heard it in like
15 years.  I get this mental picture of Nikki buying a beat up old red
painted double cab and driving up and down the CA coast in search
of buses about to be crushed.

Hey it is Friday after all, that used to mean something.
