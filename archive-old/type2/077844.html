Subject: Re: [T2] GA cops and buses


My brother (he's a jerk) tried to become a Maryland State trooper. During
the classes he was taking, the trooper who was teaching the class stated:

&quot;Sure, we pull over black people in fancy cars with out of state tags.
Just like we pull over people in VW buses. out of 10 times they have drugs
on them&quot;

So yeah, take it for what it's worth.

I for one, when pulled over *NEVER* consent to a search. Period. Not
because they'd find anything illegal (they wouldn't) but i figure if
they're gonna take time out of my day to be a bunch of jerks, i'm gonna
use up their time as well.

&gt; I got searched 3 times last year. None with my consent. Once in
&gt; Maryland when I was broken down on the side of the road (state
&gt; police).
