Subject: Re: [T2] Factory / Dealer Fog Lamps

 To be completely honest, I almost never drive the Bus, and my reasoning for installing the fog lamps are more or less to have a &quot;well optioned&quot; VW Bus. I am redoing all the wiring in my Bus and figured I might as well do this at the same time.  My front bumper has those two holes in it.. the holes that are used for the factory push-bar pieces.. (like you see on the old 70s Cadillacs).
 
 I swapped it upside down so that the holes are facing the underside of the bumper. I plan to mount the fog lamps from those holes. I probably won't use them that often. But I do want it to all look relatively factory and OEM though.
 
 Do you guys have any pictures of what the factory fog lamps looked like? Were they round or rectangular during the 73 model year?
 
 
 Thanks!!
 
 Todd

 &gt; Hi Folks,
 &gt; 
 &gt; I had a 914 many years ago, and it had a foglight switch similar to the one 
 &gt; described:
 &gt; (http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/pix/603293.jpg)
 &gt; Unfortunately the knob and bezel were more similar to the Beetle stuff than 
 &gt; the Bus stuff.  If you could get the right lens, I'm sure a rear defogger 
 &gt; switch would work well and handle the load from the lights.
 &gt; 
 &gt; In addition, Karl is right that you want your fog lights OFF when your high 
 &gt; beams are ON -- high beams make it more difficult to see thru the fog.  If 
 &gt; you want extra lighting in clear weather, you want driving lights that are 
 &gt; mounted on TOP of the bumper.  Driving lights have a clear lens for a long &amp; 
 &gt; narrow beam; fog lights have a fluted clear or yellow lens for a shorter, 
 &gt; wide beam.
 &gt; 
 &gt; If you REALLY want to tax your charging system, run both fog and driving 
 &gt; lights, switch them all separately, and switch them all on when it's super 
 &gt; dark outside.  The bonus with that is you'll also be able to read a map by 
 &gt; the little red ALT light on the dash....  grin
 &gt; 
 &gt; Good Luck!
 &gt;
