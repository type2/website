Subject: front vent - seals?
Message-Id: &lt;v04011702b41ebeb857a8_at_[209.21.144.47]&gt;

should there be rubber seals on my front fresh air vent flaps? [behind the
grill on the nose of a '71]. even when they're closed, a lot of wind
whistles through them, so i'm wondering if the rubber is just missing or if
this is another &quot;feature&quot; of my the bus design. maybe there's an adjustment
i can make somewhere to make them close tighter?
