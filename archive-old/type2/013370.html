&gt;It's a variation on the old &quot;heat shrink&quot; trick bodymen have used for ages,
&gt;and it probably only works with very small dents. Just get some dry ice and
&gt;rub the dent with it; if it's small enough it should come out.

The real trick that will take about any small to medium hail style dent is
liquid nitrogen.  If you got a friend that works in a bio lab, at a plant,
machine shop, etc.  I've seen this one done and it is amazing.  The dry
ice will work but don't pack the punch.

John
