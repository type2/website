Subject: westy top cleaning isn't rocket science

Keep it simple, gang.

I have used a green pad and some Simple Green quite successfully to clean 
westy and hightop buses that have been neglected for years.  Wanna' see some 
pictures?

They work great on chrome too, but resist the temptation to use them on a 
painted surface.
