&lt;&lt; Or the flame thrower that is being sold in South Africa. They use it to 
control car jacking. A flame thrower is mounted under the doors on one or 
both sides of the vehicle...

Their courts say it's legal - bet ours would not. The U.S. lawyers would 
have a field day.... &gt;&gt;

Wanna be really sure about the bus not goin' anywhere? Some years back
I read a write up about a guy who designed and built a 99.44% effective
anti-theft device. ANY attempt to move the vehicle tripped a front and
back mounted set of hardened steel spikes that jammed into the tarmac.
Couldn't be towed as the spikes dug deeper even if the vehicle was lifted.
