Subject: Re: [T2] Was: Being Sued by VWoA

Those folks at Continental are a bunch of con artists!!!!

&gt;Hey all, first I want to thank you all for your help when I was in need.
&gt;Let me recap..I had recieved a few letters from VWoA thru Continental
&gt;Enterprises stating that I could no longer sell some hubcap clocks I had
&gt;made a year or so earlier. We agreed to all their terms, then they
&gt;turned around and said we had to pay over $3000 in damages, and if we
&gt;didnt by a certain date, that amount could be tripled, and to top it
&gt;off, we get that letter right after going to a VW show! Anyways word
&gt;spread thru the newsgroups, and I was pointed in the direction of a fine
&gt;attorney, yes, I said FINE attorney! He did a great job with these guys
&gt;for me, writing them a lettr on my bahalf,  and for the past few months
&gt;we havent heard anything back from them. And he didnt even charge me a
&gt;penny! So thanks Chris, and once again, thanks to all who tried helping
&gt;me out! You guys saved me a bunch of cash and headaches!


Hang in there!!!!
