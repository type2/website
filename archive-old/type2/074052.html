&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've read some posts here and maybe I am having pilot bearing problem. I
&gt; press in the clutch pedal and I hear something grinding on 71 Westy. It
&gt; happens pretty much whenever the clutch pedal is pressed. Am I having pilot
&gt; bearing problem? If so, do I need to remove the engine? How much would it
&gt; cost to have it done by local VW shop?

Pilot bearing or throwout bearing.  IF the sound appears only when the
clutch is fully depressed it's pilot.  If the sound starts as soon as you
put pressure on the clutch, it's throwout.  Cure is the same in any case.
Pull engine and replace.  Do it soon if it's the pilot bearing.  If the
pilot gets stuck it will be a bear to remove the engine, and you're likely
to pull the pilot shaft out of the transmission in the process.  As for
cost, call the shop up and say &quot;How much to replace a throwout bearing in
a '71 bus?&quot;
