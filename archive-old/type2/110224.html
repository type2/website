&lt;&lt; I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;grease it up&quot; in lieu of using a cover, but 
I

have to think that any method of keeping the elments away from your bus will

help to preserve it. &gt;&gt;

Covered or not, you might also consider jacking each corner of the Bus and
suitably and safely supporting it just clear of the tires...A couple of months
of sitting in one spot &quot;could&quot; produce flat spots in the tires. Even starting 
and
running the engine every week or so (get it up to running temperature) is
better than just letting it sit...BTW, a few of the other orphan car lists I'm
on swear by &quot;Irish Spring&quot; soap as a pleasant means of keeping the lil crit-
ters from wintering in your Bus...A few bars left in their open boxes spread 
around the Bus interior and engine compartment &quot;seems&quot; to work...Check
also that there are no leaks in the glass/door seals...If the Bus has no 
water-
proof cover, an even slightly leaking seal and no air movement could accel
erate
at worst, rust, and even some mold/mildew growth. A few &quot;damp basement&quot;
dryers (essentially a container filled with silica gel) are nice to have been 
there
when you reopen in the spring... Filling the gas tank to the top with the 
correct
mixture of &quot;stuff&quot; from the lawn and garden center for lawnmower gas tanks
stored for the winter is better than an empty tank that can rust...
That said, there can still be some surprises in the Spring...We looked at an
MG once, that had been just &quot;parked&quot; in a garage for some time...We popped
the bonnet (hood) to find a very surprised opossum and fambly nesting atop
the engine... 8-(
