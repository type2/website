Remember the thread yesterday of *Oil temp, safe or not?* 
Well guys I figured it out.
The plunger on the oil pressure relief valve and spring slipped out of my
hands several times while I was reinserting it back up into the cavity.
As nature demands the valve accidentally went back in upside down (the
solid top is heavier than the hollow bottom).
The small control grove was not in the right position to allow bleeding
at high oil pleasure and make minimal use of the filter and oil cooler.
So in effect; at highway speeds and a very nice new set of bearings I was
bypassing my oil cooler once the pressure reached that magic number (what
is the number?). I was showing as much as 5 BAR pressure at 2500 RPM on a
cold engine and 3.5 BAR at 65 miles per hour at operating temperature.
The only upside to all this is that the oil pressure was so high it saved
my engine (I also backed off and didn't question the gauge, letting the
oil temp settle at a safe range). If you can accept 260 Fahrenheit as
safe. Thats 130 Celsius.
Having had this experience once it wasn't be necessary to make this
mistake again.
I failed to follow the old carpenters rule *Measure twice, cut once*.
And of course Murphy was right there too.

 So my questions are -
 
 1. If the oil cooler bypass relief valve were to be open at an 
 inappropriate
 time, would the bypass of oil around the oil cooler cause 
 overheating?
 
 2. Should I replace the relief valve plungers and springs and do any 
 other
 maintenance on these items?  Where to get the required parts?
 
 Your help is, as always, much appreciated.
