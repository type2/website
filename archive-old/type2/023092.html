&gt;In the automotive/TBA section they've just added a new line of tire chains.
&gt;These are real chains -

Hello Fred.......I ask you early, the following......
(After all, it is 38 degrees here in Houston this morning, as I sit by the 
fire out in the radio room, drinking my hot cocoa........ so my mind is 
starting to think about cold stuff)

Mary Beth and I depart May 1st as the official date for the Year 2001 leg 
of our yearly treks.

I just KNOW we are gonna get stuck in snow by our going where we plan on 
going as early as we plan to start.

Snow chains in Houston ????? Purchase what type, Where? Hah !

Fred, should I order a set of these chains you describe, and if so, a set 
for each tire, or just the back tires.
As you can see by the depth of the question, I have never had snow tires on 
anything ever before?

I figure I better have a set with me in spares stores, but better make sure 
what I get is proper, as opposed to discovering a bad fit and improper 
performance at the too late of a moment when they are needed.
