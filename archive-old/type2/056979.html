Subject: Oil Leal

This is on an engine from a '78 - 2 liter

I have been dealing with this leak ever since I got the engine a couple
of years ago.

The PO over tightened the oil strainer which caused a leak on the driver
side of the engine.

There is a bolt the is above the push rod tubes in a recess in the
center of the driver side  of the engine.
This bolt tightens in to something related to where you tighten the
strainer (documentation on this is vague).

So now that where this bolt tightens is stripped(?) bent(?) i am unable
to tighten the bolt.  For the pat year I used a spongy ring the took up
the slack and allowed me to tighten this and stop the leak.  The ring
has dissolved and the leak has returned.

What other way do you deal with this leak?

Thanks
