Hello!!! I am new to this list, and I just had a question. I am fortunate enough to have &quot;adopted&quot; a 1973 bus, about a month ago. It is automatic. The tranny is shifting great, (original) but if someday I would have problems with it, is it hard to find parts for the automatic tranny?? In most catalogs, they only advertise for the stick shifts. My other question is, can I drop a 2.0 Vanagon aircooled engine into the 1973?? Would I have to use larger carbs?? It still has the original Solexes.  
Thanks for your help.
