How do I know??

Well, yesterday I forgot to replace my gas cap on my '78 Westy after I 
filled it with gas, and before I ran it through the economy car wash.

I kinda do dumb things like that...

Now I have nearly a full tank of gas (I retrieved the gas cap from the gas 
station today)and a '78 that is a little difficult to keep running at the 
idle.  It tends to sputter, catch again, sputter, and eventually stalls.

I put in a pint of STP Water Remover.

I cannot drive it for 4 hours (gosh, this is the first time I regret getting 
20 MPG!!) to burn the tank dry, nor can I conveniently drain the tank, since 
I just started a special school right now.

Will I be all right over the next few weeks with this H2O in my tank, or 
should I make the effort and take it on the road for 200 miles??  Then, add 
some fresh gasoline.

It really runs smooth at cruise speed of 60 MPH.  And still starts without 
problem (ran about 40 miles with H2O in tank, and 20 miles with STP Water 
Remover in tank).

Thanks.  I don't really mean to start a thread on this problem of mine, but 
I do value your opinions.  FYI, the '78 has an exposed gas filler port 
without the gas cap; there is no flap covering the gas filler port like the 
early '70s
