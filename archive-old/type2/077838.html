Subject: Re: [T2] 2.0L heads on a 2.0L engine

just a fair warning:

i ordered some rebuilt 1.8 heads from Bus Depot when
rebuilding my 2.0.

what i got was an inferior rebuild if i do say so
myself. 

the heads had been SANDblasted instead of glass bead
blasted. the old guides were still in it (they were
sandblasted too), and i was given OLD valves (some had
RUST on them). the WORST part about these head came
when i trial fit a cylinder into the holes in the
head. the cylinder would SLIDE side-to-side, a very
loose fit in the head. this is definitely NOT KOSHER
and i will be sending these back to busdepot soon.

under the rocker covers i thought i could make out a
stamp that said SIR. i thought busdepot sold rebuilt
parts from AVP, but these didnt say AVP anywhere.

i must apologize to RON for taking it to the list
before taking it to him, and it is in no way his
fault. I am in no way badmouthing your business. I buy
almost ALL of my bus parts from busdepot. my rebuilt
AVP 2.0 that i bought from him is still kickin strong
after almost 30k, and the heads on IT said GEX under
the valve covers! (i guess (hope)they were rebuilt
more than once)

so RON, i'll be in touch with you to rectify this as
soon as i can find some TIME (precious commodity of
which i have little).

moral of the story:  whatever heads you buy, run over
them with a fine tooth comb, you should be able to
spot shoddy workmanship. no you cant check the
interference fit of the valve seats, but I was able to
tell mine were unusable without even disassembling
them. if they look good on the outside, go ahead and
disassemble them and check the valve seating with some
prussian blue. also check the amount of play in the
valve guides. if you dont know what you're looking at
on a cylinder head, take it to a machine shop or vw
repair shop you trust and have them show you what's
wrong and tell you why.

always, check, recheck, and recheck, then assemble
ONCE, AFTER you know it's RIGHT.

apparently a lot of head &quot;remanufacturers&quot; let them go
after only a cleaning and lapping. not in MY engine.

sorry again if i stepped on any toes.

Peace!
