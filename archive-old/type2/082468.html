Subject: freeday

I have to say this has been the most entertaining
Freeday posts I have seen in a long time.
Bus content:&lt;required&gt;
  I may have found a small poptop for my bay window.
It is off a splittie and I am wondering if anyone has
mounted one of these on their bay window with a stock
slider sun roof. Please share insights.
  TIA
