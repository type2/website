Subject: $10 digital dipstick thermometer?
Message-Id: &lt;199906181124.HAA12874_at_mime3.prodigy_dot_com&gt;

While at the local Shopright, I noticed they had $15 digital &quot;meat&quot;
thermometers on sale for $9.99 - with a range to 300 degrees and a battery
life of one year continuous.....so I got one.
The wheels started spinning....realizing these things have a thermister in
the tube......Popped the case and see 2 nice free wires 1.5&quot; long going
into the tube end!   The tube has a slot in the end facing the electronics,
and I slid it right out using a fine screwdriver.  Hmm- the wheels started
spinning- the tube is more than narrow enough for dipstick tube- less than
1/8&quot; wide.   A digital dipstick sender?   What if you clip the wires and
get the Dreml out and carefully grind  the 5&quot; tube circumferentially near
the top to remove the thickend flange.  Finely solder an extension double
wire  between it and the readout top.  I have extra phone wire!  Gob
non-conductive JB weld or epoxy over the exposed wire connections   that
will reach into the dipstick tube and let set.  Slide a brass tube over the
tip+wires so about 3&quot; of tip is exposed (hobby shop- they come 12&quot; long in
1/32&quot; steps-I measure 15/64 inner diamter to dipstick tube, so 7/32&quot; tube
should work) .  Fill this with epoxy from upper end and when tip shows it's
embedded, tape it so epoxy stays in to set.  Solder a brass washer to upper
end so it can't fall into case.  Now you have a dipstick sender!  Any long
time set epoxy will withstand the 400 degrees of my woodstove- used it to
glue a handle to my flue gas diverter on the stove side.
    Radio Shack sells indoor outdoor thermometers with about 10 feet of
wire- the sender end looks small enough to fit down a dipstick tube if you
tweak it a bit with grinding/sanding.   I don't know if their max range
goes to 300, though and you have to protect all wires that might melt their
insulation at 270 degrees.
