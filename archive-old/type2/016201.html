Dave,

I did the same thing to my bus about a year ago.  It was obvious that rain
would collect in the channel underneath the seal and it would cause problems
later.  I decided to drill 5-6 holes evenly spaced in the bottom of the
channel.  I used a small bit (5/32) which is plenty large enough for water
to escape, but not large enough to damage the integrity of the channel.  I
made certain to prime and paint the holes and I removed the dash board to
prime and paint the channel from the backside also.  The amount of water
that comes through while driving in a rain storm is too small to cause any
problems, but if you drilled too many holes or made them too large then
water coming in may cause problems.  It's been more than a year and I have
no signs of rust or other problems.  There may be better solutions out
there, but I haven't seen them.  By the way, I don't care what anybody says,
water WILL collect under the seal.  One parts supplier tried to convince me
that I simply needed a more expensive seal, but a friend bought one and it
still collects water.  

If you already have rust lines and you haven't even driven in the rain yet
then it sounds like you need to use better surface prep, a rust inhibitor,
more primer, better primer, more paint, and better paint.  This is a tough
area to fix so don't take any shortcuts.

&gt;Can anyone here tell me how to prevent RUST from forming under a bay windo 
&gt;Bus' front windshield? Better yet, how do you keep water out from
underneath 
&gt;it? I removed my old glass, cleaned, filled some tiny holes, rust proff 
&gt;primed, and painted the area then installed a new seal. It hasn't even
rained 
&gt;here (just morning DEW) and now I see a rust trail starting under the 
&gt;window!!!  When I lifted up the rubber it was all wet underneath. What
gives? 
&gt; Besides the obvious clue to never getting it wet can anyone give me a
better 
&gt;solution? Should I coat the entire surface in silicone? Any help would be 
&gt;appreciated.
