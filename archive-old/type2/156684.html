Subject: Re: [T2] BussDepot ??

&gt; I'm trying to buy an engine from them,for my  '77 westy, I'm looking for a
&gt; complete rebuilt  2.0 L  along with the tin.

No such animal from BD.  You can buy a long block resold by them and put your
component and tin on it.

&gt; I've sent them 2 e-mails in the
&gt; past week and 1/2  trying to get a price for them to ship it to B.C.

If you're spending that kind of money, why not place a phone call and talk to
someone direct?
