&gt; More likely to keep the drum from coming off while changing a flat
tire. Your average motorist would have no clue what to do if the drum

Sometimes I have desparately _wished_ that I had a problem with the drum
coming off with the wheel!  :)

Sometimes that thing can be a bear.  Once off and cleaned, anti-sieze in
