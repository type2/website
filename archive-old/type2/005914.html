[...]

In theory it can accelerate wear in the hinges and opening/closing
mechanism.

Regardless. I've been doing it for nearly 23 years and have never had a
problem.  Best to have screens in place, though, to stop flying debris and
errant bug-type critters.

The 1970 Campmobile manual doesn't address the issue - I don't know about
other years.

From my perspective the main drawback is that the corners of the window
frames can be very sharp.  Accidentally brushing or bumping them when
they're extended can cause a nasty wound [and I have the scars to prove it].

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Is there any problems asociated with driving a Westy with the long side
louver windows open?  &lt;&lt;
