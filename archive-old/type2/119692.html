&lt;&lt; If your system is clean and tight, I'd be tempted to just recirculate all
the air.  You're right in that the recirculation will result in the air
getting warmer and warmer which is a good thing when the mercury drops
below freezing.

I had a three speed Blazer blower mounted in the spare tire well of a '71.
I capped off the heater outlets in the fan shroud and let the engine fan
just cool the engine. The air from inside the Bus was blown through some
hi-temp flexible hosing, thru' the heat exchangers and out from the heat
and defroster vents...Noisy? You bet, but hot, hot, hot eventually... ;-)
