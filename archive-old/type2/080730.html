Subject: Fw: [T2] 2L Engine help please

Many thanks to Sean Bartnik,

Sean you were sport on, a valve seat had dropped and that was causing the
problems. Unfortunately
the valve seat had already been repaired (badly) So it looks like I'll have
to buy an exchange unit!

The piston crown had been nicked (by about 3mm) by the valve. I've cleaned
it up with a Dremel, but will this cause
me more problems - should I replace the piston?

Dave, Wales

&gt;
&gt; The 2L engine in my bus started &quot;ticking&quot; at high revs and eventually
&gt; overheated. I've now taken off the cylinder head to reveal a mark in the
&gt; piston crown caused by the exhaust valve!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I've noticed that there are no gaskets between the crankase and cylinder
&gt; barrel and between the barrel and the cylinder head.
&gt; Should there be? If so I presume this is why the valve had been hitting
the
&gt; piston crown. - or could it be a weak valve spring as well?
&gt; -----------
&gt;
&gt; On the 2L there is typically not a gasket/seal between the head and the
&gt; cylinder.  Any gaskets used between the cylinder and crankcase are used
&gt; solely to adjust deck height (and therefore compression ratio) if
necessary.
&gt; They are optional since they may not be required.
&gt;
&gt; Check the condition of that valve seat.  I would suspect that's the whole
&gt; problem.  The valve seat probably dropped out of the head and kept the
valve
&gt; from closing all the way.  The piston was striking it which was probably
the
&gt; ticking sound.  The engine probably overheated from running on 3
cylinders.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; --------------
&gt; I bought the engine after it had a dropped valve repaired.
&gt;
&gt; Also I think it may have overheated because the flaps weren't working
&gt; properly - would I be better off removing them as I wouldn't be putting
many
&gt; miles on the engine in the future?
&gt; --------------
&gt;
&gt; You certainly won't be putting many miles on the engine if you leave the
&gt; flaps out.  If you leave the flaps out, no cooling air will be directed
&gt; through the oil cooler and the engine will overheat.  If your thermostat
is
&gt; broken, replace it.  If the flaps aren't working properly, fix the system.
