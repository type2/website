Volks,

Well, I think I might have it caged, at least this version.  *However* the
filter I have put in is only good against this individual virus.  If
someone changes it a little, then it will be back :-( And given the nature
of the net, I figure that will take about a week :-(((

Please be on guard.  The general rule is that if you don't know what it
is, don't run it. Don't let your computer run programs you get off the
net, especially automatically, unless you are *very* sure!
