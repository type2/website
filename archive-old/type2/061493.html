Subject: solex 30 pict 3 throttle valve stop screw--size and pitch?

Hi, folks:

my throttle valve stop screw went missing--might still be in some dark
corner of the engine compartment, but I'm guessing not.  

Can anyone help me with the size/pitch info to replace it--I'm figuring
I'll need a screw and a nut to stop it, right?

thanks
