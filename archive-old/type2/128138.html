Subject: broke down

I have a 70'westy. A couple of days ago she died on me. I pushed in the clutch and then silence. I have gas, and she turns over fine. But I don't seem to be getting a spark from my coil. Tried a new coil and still nothing. I have power to the coil but no spark jumping off of the distributor to coil wire. 
Another thing I noticed is that the ground wire from my alternator is getting hot when I turn her over.?.? 
What am I missing here?
The coil to dist. wire looks fine, but could it be shot? 
I should be getting a spark from the coil, when holding the wire next to the doghouse or manifold, right? 
I'm in need of some HELP here. Any ideas? -Chris
