Subject: Re: [T2] need part

Sounds familiar - I am also looking for these things (as well as the
little covers for the bottom part of the fan housing that mates to the
heat exchangers).

My only leads: BusDepot has the hardware for mounting the thermostat.
Unfortunately, it appears that nobody makes the type 4 thermostats
anymore.  But, it looks like the type 1 thermostats can be converted for
use with the type 4's.  Check out:

http://aircooled_dot_net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=ESM0002&amp;cartid=

In the pulldown menu, select &quot;Type 1, 80-85 Degree C Unit&quot;.  There are
instructions for the conversion.

&gt;      I am looking for the little flappers that go in the bottom of the
&gt; fan housing.  They prevent air from returning into the fan housing.  I
&gt; would also need the pins they ride on if possible.  I have never seen a
&gt; source for these.  Also, if anybody has any type 4 thermostat parts, I
&gt; am looking for those too.  Thanks.
