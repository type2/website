First, many thanks to those who helped me by answering some
of my questions last week!
First, I notice that I can shift into reverse without pushing
down on the shift knob.  In my '66, I can't shift into reverse
unless I press down while shifting.  Is this a difference with
the older model or is something broken?  If it is broken, how
is it fixed?  There also seems to be a bit longer throw to the
shifts on the older bus.  I just attribute this to worn out
linkage but perhaps the linkage is a bit different on the older
busses?

there is something wrong.  Either the plate under the shift stick is worn, or
the bit on the shift stick that holds it under the plate is worn or both.  The
pate is cheap to get a new one, around $5.  The 59 shift stick was 60 and back
(circa).  The round plate above the ball shouldd be round, not flat on one
side.  If it is flattened on the one side, this indicates wear.   I saw a NOS
one at one point.  he he he .  sorry.   Sometimes loosening the 2 13mm nuts
and wiggling it around helps.   Do take care- you dont want to go into reverse
when you are aiming for second.

the linkage is different.  Dont know if the throw is differnt.
 . . . . . .

Second, my headlights don't seem very bright.  I've always heard
stories about how 6 Volt vehicles have dim headlights but now
that I'm experienceing it for myself, I'm wondering if this is
a bug or a feature, that is, is this the way it was when the 
vehicle was new or is there something wrong that I can fix?  I
suspect that cleaning all the electrical connections might help
as might running a couple new wires from the battery to the
front of the bus.  Any wisdom from 6 Volt bus owners out there?

clean off all your connections and grounds.  At the risk of the wrath of
others coming down on my head, I reserve the right to say 6v does not mean
dim.    Clean your connections and ground, and the electricity will flow
better, making better illumination.   Do not restrict this activity to the
headlights, but  feel free to expand it throughout the wiring harness.  Think
of nearly 40 years of corrosive atmosphere, and  think of happy  smiling
laughing flowing 6Venergy  running wild and free!!!!!!
