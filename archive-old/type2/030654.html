Subject: 82 Update #3.5

Tested the double relay.

No voltage out of 88a with the key on.  (looking at the wiring diagram, it
should..and is the same wire that is #10 on the ECU harness..)

Voltage in all the right places before its switch in the relay, though.
so, jumped the relay manually (jumperwire between the wire that is before
the internal switch, to the wire after the switch..), in an attempt to see
if that would allow it to run.

Tried it a few ties, nothing.  I'll note though that with that wire
jumped, the fuelpump starts running.  AT least, I think it is the pump.
something fairly loud starts whirrrrrrrring.  Sounds like a pump...

it still just makes the vrrrrm and dies, running off the cold start
injection only.

*sigh*
