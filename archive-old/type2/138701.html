Subject: RE: [T2] Prices for a valve job?

&gt;Hello all,

&gt;My first post to this list, and unfortunately not a happy one! Just
&gt;bought an '83 air cooled Westfalia, which was to be my summer
&gt;camp-mobile - I stupidly didn't get it inspected before purchase, and
&gt;am now stuck with an engine with 0 compression in one of the
&gt;cylinders.

&gt;The local shop (Fred's in Redwood City, CA) quoted ~$1900 for a valve
&gt;job. I've heard only good things about them, so it's probably a fair
&gt;price, but I've learned my lesson and will check everything before
&gt;jumping in! Is this price standard?

&gt;I'm not exceptionally mechanically able, but I can find my way around
&gt;a motorcycle engine, and I learn things quickly if it means saving
&gt;thousands of dollars. Is it possible to take the heads off myself and
&gt;have the work done for far less dollars? In perusing the type2
&gt;archives, I saw some talk of getting new valves in and lapped and
&gt;reground and all for ~400, but this may be a different beast or way
&gt;out of date.

&gt;Finally, would I be better off looking for another engine and swapping
&gt;out? Or does anybody want to buy my van?!!

&gt;Thanks for any and all assistance with this. I'm hoping to get out of
&gt;this crappy situation with as little damage to my wallet as possible -
&gt;I certainly wasn't anticipating these costs right off the bat. The
&gt;engine was supposedly replaced with a GEX rebuild 15,000 miles ago.




Most expensive VW valve job I have ever heard of. But they must be doing 
everything. I had a pair of heads that I took to a local machine shop about 
5 months ago. Valves ground and replace 5 guides, cost $150, I thought it 
was a little steap.


GEX is something I have as well. Mixed opinion on this one because I still 
have not put her on the road.  For $1900, I would look for a rebuilt 
longblock and swap them yourself.
