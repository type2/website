&gt; Hi Bus pilots,
&gt;
&gt; I was wandering around in a local Sears about a week ago and noticed a
&gt; digital VOM that included dwell and tach readings.  It's by Actron, I think
&gt; this is the one

&gt; As I get older it's harder to read my analog meters and I thought this just
&gt; might be the ticket at $60 US.  Do any of you have this and if so, does it
&gt; do the job?

Digital meters do just fine, as long as you want definite readings and are
not trying to show trends.

I still use my analog Heathkit dwell meter, but it has a large meter that
is friendly to my aging vision.
