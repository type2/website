Subject: Re: [T2] Winter progress

Jamey,

Everything so far sounds great!

Hi temp sealant should be fine, the only place I would worry about it is 
anyplace close the the HE's.

I also blocked off one of the Y tubes and sealed around the vac hose...you 
can then go up front and listen and feel how much air is being sucked thru 
which vents.  If it doesn't sound/ feel good, then search along the tubes 
looking/listening for leaks.

I actually had my shop vac outside the garage door with the hose coming 
inside(with an etension).

Let us know how it goes!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks Dave!
&gt; I also rammed a vacuum tube down the y-tube, but all I got was a bit of
&gt; sand. I didn't get as far down as the front, where you found more crud.
 In my check, I found that air delivery was at:
 1)fan housing (thank god)
 2)after heat exchanger
 3)after plastic accordion tubes
 4)finally, and weakly, at foot vents
 I found a frozen cable on the driver's side and broke it trying to free it
&gt; up. Now it's zip tied fully open. I am hopeful in sealing all of the mating
&gt; surfaces next week --- when 65 degree weather will let me work outside! :-)
&gt; Is hi temp gasket sealant ok? Not that it's exactly high temperature at the
&gt; vent....

&gt; Thanks to all for sharing your good advice.
