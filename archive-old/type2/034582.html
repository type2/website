Thanks for the concern, however, not to worry...she's in fine hands. 
We've
actually given her a brand spankin' new motor, exhaust, trans and
clutch.
Not to mention her brand new paint job.  That van is part of my
livelyhood
and I take better care of her than I do pretty much anything else in my
life.  By the way, the reason she does 90 mph (and we don't do that any
more
since the overhaul) is because she had this thing called a &quot;BusBoy&quot;
conversion done by its previous owner and according to the mechanic who
did
the conversion, it's done specifically to increase highway speed albeit
not
90 mph.

Curious, I've been getting a bunch of email today from other VW people,
how
did you here about the van?
