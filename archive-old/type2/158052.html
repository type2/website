Subject: Re: [T2] plastic brake hose 76 bus

You're right on about Tygon, George.  I used to sell a lot of it.  Tygon is a brand name but there are many lower-quality knock-offs coming out of China.  If you can use Tygon, I'd recommend Tygon brand tubing from someplace like http://www_dot_usplastic_dot_com.  It's not very expensive.  Neoprene is supposed to be compatible with brake fluid.  Might be worth trying.  Cheers...KR

Well, I've run into a lot of &quot;experts behind counters&quot; who didn't know
anything beyond what the manufactuerers recommend.

Brake fluid isn't all that evil a liquid, seeing as how they let ordinary
humans play with it with only the standard &quot;don't drink this stuff&quot;
warning.

I'd suspect that Teflon line would work fine, considering that the linint
of the &quot;braided stainless&quot; brake lines is Teflon.  There is also
plastic brake line used in bicycles and experimental aircraft made of
nylon-II:

This stuff is used in the pressurized part of the brake system so it would
have no problem in the unpressurized part of our systems!

I've also seen references to Tygon tubing being compatible with brake
fluid, but caution is needed here because there are many different types
of Tygon tubing.

What we really need is for someone to put samples of various
readily-available plastic tubing in bottles of brake fluid.  In a couple
of years we would have a good compatibility test!

George  &lt;--now, where were those alka-seltzer bottles...
