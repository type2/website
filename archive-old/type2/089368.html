Subject: Re: Re: [T2] Frozen Brakes!??

Doug,

&gt; You should try a penetrating oil on the stars, it will loosen
them up. I use
&gt; the GUNK brand, available at Lowes and Home Depot.

I will try this later - have the Gunk, but was wary of lube on
brake components...

&gt; Did you also replace the wheel cylinder and all the brake
hardware? Whenever
&gt; you work on a van that you have no clue about it's history I
find its better
&gt; to overdo it, and replace EVERYTHING, ESPECIALLY on brakes. So
what if the
&gt; wheel cylinder didnt need replacing, it will one day, and you
will already
&gt; have a spare.

Yup.  That was the impetus for the brake job in the first place -
two bad wheel
cylinders.

&gt; Did you bleed the brakes correctly?

Yes.  I thought it was a relatively easy process given a helper.

&gt; &gt; Damn.  Idiot break light is on - but strangely, only when
**not**
&gt; &gt; applying the breaks.  If
&gt; &gt; I apply the breaks, off goes the light.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like you need to try bleeding your brakes.
&gt;

I'll do so today. Is the light-on-when-brake-off symptom always
an indication of
a need to bleed?

Cheers!
