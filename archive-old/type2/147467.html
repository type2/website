Subject: Something to consider with hylomar

I have been using hylomar for sealing valve covers for several years and 
it has worked well for me. The only caveat is that it is not supposed to 
be stored at a temperature of over 100 degrees F. A lot of places have 
temps that high on at least a few days every summer so storing it in a 
garage might be marginal. The inside of a bus can easily get that hot 
when parked in the sun on a hot summer day so I don't keep the hylomar 
in my bus toolbox. Maybe on my next long summer trip I will store it in 
the beer cooler! :)

Has anyone noticed any changes in the stuff after storing at a very high 
temp?
