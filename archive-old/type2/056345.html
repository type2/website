&gt;Hello!, I am rebuilding a 1978 type IV 1700.  When I pulled the push rod

&gt;this normal for this engine?  Does this indicate a problem with the lifters
&gt;or the camshaft?  Can someone please advise me on this?

That is probably where the wire spring retainer came loose and was rubbing
on the pushrod.  I've seen it so bad that it wore through the aluminum
pushrod and it broke in two.  You should have steel pushrods so you
probably won't have that problem.  Make sure the wire spring retainers are
in properly.  They should be nice and tight.
