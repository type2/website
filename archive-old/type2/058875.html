Subject: Funky Engine Rhythm

I recently bought a '77 Westfalia and have been having a great time getting to know it, cleaning it up and getting it running right.

I just had some exhaust work done (I'm no welder) so it's nice and quiet. It's amazing how poorly a bus will run without back pressure! 
And, after many evenings with a voltmeter, I fixed my horn this weekend. I think after a whole bunch of tinkering that all that was wrong were some corroded leads at the horn. BTW, the PO had installed 2 horns on this bus. Is that common? I'm afraid that might have been part of my problem. Thanks a TON to all the volks who have written in to list in the past with similar problems. The Type 2 Archive is an great resource. 
However, my latest issue comes with the way the bus is running. One of the POs put in a newer '79 engine and it seemed to do quite well after the exhaust was fixed, other than it tended to lurch a bit in park (did I mention it's an automatic?). I changed the oil according to the Muir manual and it ran well. The mechanic who did the exhaust work suggested putting in some JB Fuel Injector cleaner to help smooth out the idle, but now it has this strange rhythm where it unexpectantly revs up a little every few seconds. Also, it has very little power starting from a complete stop, almost like it's not running on all the cylinders. Once it gets going I suppose it's OK, but it just doesn't seem to have the pep it had right after the exhaust work. All the while it has that rhythm, cold or not.

After re-reading the above, I realize I'd better recap:

'77 Westy with a '79 automatic, fuel-injected engine. Chronology:

Bought bus
Had exhaust fixed
Changed oil
 - Rough idle in Park
Starting tracking down horn fix
Added Fuel Injector Cleaner on full tank of gas
- Strange rhythm started shortly after
Fixed horn

I know that is a little convoluted, but I'd really like to figure out what this is. I have a feeling it's a simple thing that I may have done, or the injector cleaner.

Can anyone out there with some psychic engine troubleshooting skills help me?

Thanks for listening,
