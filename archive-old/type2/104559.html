Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line 

From: &lt;Neorobb1_at_aol_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Yep, sure is. It runs between the fuel tank outlet on the passenger side
of the tank, across to the drivers side. If you look real close, I'll bet
you can find the clips for it still in place.

No, I didn't see any line like that.  What I do have is a rubber fuel line
coming out from where the engine air gasket meets the bottom driver's side
corner of the plate covering the fuel tank.  Then there's an electric fuel
pump, then a fuel filter, then the line finally goes to the carburetor.  No
metal anywhere that I could see.

The only other line that seems to be fuel related is a plastic line that
comes out of the firewall to the right of where the rubber fuel line comes
through.  This line connects to a check valve (?) and continues as a rubber
line that connects to the intake manifold below the carb.

Maybe this is a bit beyond not being stock...  does run, though.
