Subject: Installation of Oil Rings

*******************
Taken from Chilton-

A - Be sure that the ring gaps are of the correct dimension. Stagger the 
ring gaps around the piston, but make sure that the oil ring gap is 
positioned up when the pistons are in position on the connecting rods.

*******************
WAIT A MINUTE:::  The instructions that came with my piston rings say-

B -  Install Expander-Spacer in cleaned oil ring grove with gap directly 
above wrist pin hole.  Install Steel Rail [ a 3 piece oil ring, BTW] on top 
side of Expander, making sure the Expander-Spacer ends are not overlapped  
The gap of the Steel Rail should be 1 to 2 to the left of the 
Expander-Spacer.  Install remaining Steel Rail below the Expander-Spacer.  
The gap of the Steel Rail should be 1 to 2 to the right of the 
Expander-Spacer gap. [Diagrams were provided]

So, what advice should I follow on the oil rings, A or B
