Subject: Wiring help w/turn signal switch

My turn signal switch was trash so I went to the local VW junkyard and got a
replacement switch.  Upon installation I found the new (used) switch had one
less wire than the original.  Also, the color of some of the wires are
different (two of the wires on the new switch are white and there are not
white wires on the old).  Can I make this new switch work somehow?  I pretty
much matched up all the wires I could and everything seemed to work EXCEPT:
 
1. Both rear lights would not flash (only the front ones worked)
2. Emergency blinkers only activated the front signals.
 
I need to know where to hook up the two white wires off the new switch (one
is solid white and the other is white with black stripe).  There is an extra
wire in the dash (black and purple).  It goes to the emergency blinker
switch.
 
Anyone have any ideas?  Should I just return the switch and get the model
that was supposed to work?
