&gt; Well, unfortunately I'm not going to be able to make Everybus

&gt; finding reliable help for my mother.  And the main  reason....Uncle
&gt; Sam took a huge, unexpected bite out of my a** this  week!  So I'm
&gt; going to keep working and try to make another camp  out somewhere
&gt; this spring.  And I'll definitely plan on seeing you  all there next
&gt; year.  Maybe I'll have the new paint job by  then.  

Sorry to hear that, but I can tell you that between a new paint job or 
going to a bus gathering of the caliber of EB, your money would be much 
better spent using the bus instead of making it look shiny. You know you 
want to, go to EB.
