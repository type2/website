&gt; Its really worth it to install relays and run power directly from the

&gt; lights if you don't want to assemble the few parts yourself.

I agree on this one.  Running relays will also save your headlight switch,
since it will no longer have to carry the full headlight current

Make sure that the new current-carrying wires are fused, preferably with
self-resetting circuit breakers.  It's a very good idea to run separate
left and right feeds to the headlights, so the failure of one will not
leave you completely in the dark.
