&gt; Hello All    There are a couple of things  they make a lock for the vents 
&gt; that can't be gotten into except by breaking the glass, detacting sound 

I have had my van broken into through an unlocked door (talk about
dumb) and all they stole was a case of adult diapers I was delivering for
a friend (not going there)

&gt; system is a good idea, I put all my goodies in the engine compartment that 
&gt; has a locking latch. nobody would know that they are there. The best was my 

not much room and have to remove before driving.  

I don't have a back seat and have &quot;boxed&quot; out the rear area to make a
locking trunk.
