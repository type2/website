Subject: Re: [T2] brake resevoir line dilemma

Hiya Craig,

I went through all this with The Duck a couple of years ago.  I wound up trotting on down to the local hydraulics shop and getting my hose from them.  And while it bears little resemblance to the clear aquarium-type hose used originally, this stuff is absolutely bulletproof.  Heat and acid resistant and (with the use of new clamps) I didn't have to use those Mickey Mouse rubber seals on the reservoir nipples.  If you'd like more details I can forward you the hose specifications later.  I'm at work right now.

Mike
