Subject: Oil cooler heater.....

I'm thinking the oil would be too cold to be useful by the time it got that 
far forward. You are right about lube issues too. I'm not sure on the math 
of hydraulics, but I think the further it goes, the lower the pressure gets. 
The idea might work out if the cooler were placed below the back seat.

&gt; My idea was to fit an additional oil cooler below the cabin floor just 
&gt; where
the heater tube comes in and mount a fan behind it to push air through it
and into the cabin
