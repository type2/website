Subject: stalling &amp; low power on '71 bus

I'm frustrated, and aggravated, and annoyed, and even threatened my bus
that I would look for a new car in the want ads...truth is, I don't have
enough $ for a new one...

My car kept stalling on my way to school today.  When I hit the brakes,
it stalls, when I am idling it stalls, and when it is not stalling, it is
running so slow, that it is dangerous...I was having to stay around 40mph
on a 65mph highway.

I thought it may be either be a bad spark plug, or  wire, or maybe a
clogged pvc pipe, by when I mentioned it to my Dad, he said it most
likely isn't.  This last weekend, we were working on the
wiring/electrical system, because the fuse working the brake lights, and
horn would not stop blowing...After trying many combinations of trial and
errors, we got both the horn and brake lights working at the same time,
without blowing a fuse.  The problem is that we have no clue as to which
combination it was that got it to work, because we were trying several
things at the same time.  My dad figured that the stalling is being
caused by something that has to do with what we did this last weekend,
because there were no problems before.  

I'm not ruling out the possibility of coincidence, or the connection to
the fuse problem. I'm just frustrated because I know minimal amounts of
auto repair(not even a semester of the class yet), and my transportation
to school is now becoming a safety hazard.  I'm ready to say I will just
ride the yellow school bus tomorrow.  I tried getting his help but my dad
is upstairs watching some stupid show about an alien, and I need help
figuring out what is wrong with my bus...

 When your engine completely shuts off when you are stopping/slowing
down, and not getting up to the proper speed when driving, it's not a
good thing.  I still have a ton of frustration built up, but thanks for
letting me let some of it out...If anyone has any suggestions of what
could be causing the stalling and low power problems, please share them
with me....                     Dallas Smith
