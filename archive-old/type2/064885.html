Subject: RE: warming up the engine ...

According to Click and Clack in their book they say that its baloney to 
leave the car running in the driveway, just take it easy for a few 
minutes before you hit the highway. All you have to do is let the oil 
get moving around a bit after having settled down into the reservoir.

Oh yeah, here's their web site. . .=20

My husband and I have had a running argument on this subject for years. 
He
thinks the '82 aircooled Vanagon should sit and &quot;warm up&quot; after being 
turned
on. I always turn it on and take off immediately, as suggested in the
handbook. (Since it's mine I win anyway. &lt;g&gt;) Any comments?
