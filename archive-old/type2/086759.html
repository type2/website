Subject: Exaust Stud removal and other

I am going to torch the exaust studs to get them out.  It there anything I
should be sure to do or not do.  Is mapp or propane going to be enough?
The weather here is still about 40-50 and they won't budge.

Also what flavor of goup should I use to aid in the sealing of the push
rod tubes.

Thanks
