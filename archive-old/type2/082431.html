Subject: RE: [T2] engine removal/supporting tranny

&gt; I have a 1972 Westy with a siezed 1800 that I will be=20
&gt; replacing with my new 2.0 AVP this weekend.  I have been=20
&gt; reading the procedures in Bentley and am confused about a=20
&gt; support bar under the transmission when you remove the engine=20
&gt; (Engine and clutch, Pg 9, paragraph 16).  Is this necessary=20
&gt; for my year and engine?  Could I use a scissors jack or=20
&gt; something to do the job instead?

I was confused about this as well (79 bay).  After scratching
my head over this for awhile, I just followed the instructions
and used a chain (wrapped through various body members) to support
the front of the tranny per Bentley.  After I removed the engine,=20
I crawled back under to look at the tranny.  It seemed to have
sagged a little, just enough to put some tension on the chain.
So I assumed Bentley was correct on this.  My father-in-law said
that he never supported trannies when he used to &quot;mess around with VWs&quot;,
he looked at me like I was crazy when I told him I had to support the
tranny.  I'm betting he never &quot;messed around&quot; with a type IV though =
(he's
an awesome body man, owned a shop for years, but I sometimes question
his mechanical ability.) =20

Do you have to support the tranny?  I have no idea, but I bet that if =
you
don't, it makes for some interesting angles when you go to put the
engine back in (you'd prolly have to jack the front of the tranny up.)

This of course is based on my limited experience, I've only done 1
removal/installation.  I'm sure there are some folks here with better
insight.
