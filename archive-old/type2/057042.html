Subject: Alignment shopp, ATL, or Columbia SC area?

Hey folks....

Sometime in the next weeks, i'll be NEEDING to get my poor front end
realigned...which should have been done eons ago..but i digress.  I've
yet to find a shop locally who will do it(at least, reliably...). (Augusta
GA)

I can do my own toe, but lack the equipment to measure my camber.  But it
is visibly off, which is no good!

So.  Anyone know of a reputable shop who's willing to adjust hte camber on
a 69 with a only-slightly-loose steering box?:)  And torn balljoint
boots?:) (but good joints! redo the imprivisio boots every then and
again)

Really not limited to Atlanta or Columbia, but both of those are easy to
get to...and i'm at least halfassedly familar with Atlanta...:)

If it's within 3-4 hours, i'll prolly do it! If they can mount tires, and
check my rear wheel alignment, and perhaps balance large5 rims, too, for a
reasonable price, it'd be great!

thanks....david (who killed a pair of 370's in 30k.......no tread on
one....idontwannagetintoit...)
