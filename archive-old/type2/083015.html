Subject: Dual Carbs Issues

Looking at ways to fix my leaky old dual solexes
that were stock on my '74 1800.  Seems to be the
throttle shaft.  I know I can do that temp fix
thing with various sealants.  I also know that
Denmeister rebushes them (and rebuilds the
carbs)-- but I'll have lots of money in them by
the time I pick up a spare set, ship to Den, pay
the man, and ship em home.  (Den is in Oh
Canada!)

So I was thinking that 34ICT's would be only a
little more and I get new carbs.  I know they
won't give me more performance, but if I wanted
horsepower I'd be throwing $2000 into an 4.3
Astro.  Anyone running these or installed these
for others?  Hard to dial in?  Comments?
