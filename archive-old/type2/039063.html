Subject: NOT a westy stool

I'm interested in finding, fitting or fabricating a centre front seat for my
1970 Devon.
(To convert it to a non-walkthrough)   - But I'm (still) not really sure
whether this can 
be done with stock parts or not.  

Was there ever a true non-walkthrough bay-window bus ?   
    (I'm sure there must be, but I've never seen one.) 

Or alternatively, can anyone give me details of how such a seat might be
rigged up.
(Obviously safety will be an issue)

Thanks in advance.
