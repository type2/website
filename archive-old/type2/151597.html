&gt;Well, I finally installed my new Dakota Digital CHT gauge and boy am I

&gt;Well, sort of at least the gauge works great, but Im not sure what
&gt;readings I should be expecting at different speeds and what temp reading
&gt;would I wait for to consider that the motor is warmed up.  Ive search
&gt;the archives in an attempt to get a consensus of what I should expect of
&gt;the readings I think I remember a posting this summer with the info I
&gt;need now, but I just cant find it.

Wayne,

Go to http://www.germansupply_dot_com and read their tech article on
CHT gauge installation. There's some info there about temps. Page 4, I
believe.

My '79 does not have a rev limiter, but I seem to recall that the stock
rotor has a limiter...I may be wrong though.
