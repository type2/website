Zelazny's Amber Headed To Film

Ed Neumeier, who adapted Robert Heinlein's classic SF novel Starship
Troopers for the big screen, will next turn his hand to Roger Zelazny's
fantasy novel Nine Princes in Amber, according to The Hollywood
Reporter. Producer Mark Canton and Batman Forever writer Akiva Goldsman
are teaming with Neumeier to turn Nine Princes into a feature film.

The story centers around a man who awakens one day with amnesia, only
to learn that he is the prince of a powerful realm that exists on a
greater plane than our own. He finds he must fight his way through
political intrigues that would put the Greek gods to shame even as he
struggles to regain his memory.
