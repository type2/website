Subject: [T2] Lookin' for parts (in all the wrong places)

I am out of necessity rebuilding from scratch the brakes on the 
Damfino. I'm pretty much having to replace everything down to the 
smallest nut as the whole shootin' match was a mass of rust. However 
their are some parts which I can't seem to find. I'm thinking of the 
parking brake lever and connecting bar in the rear wheels, for one. 
Anyone with good used brake parts for a 73 Westy (incl. calipers and 
rotors) please email me off list.

I've spent plenty already at the Bus Depot (thanks, Ron!); if I keep 
that up, this beast is going to break me...
