Thanks.

Funny that you should ask! There is an 'agent' in the US, that being
&quot;Runny&quot; or something in New Mexico. Ads are purportedly in Hot VW's
magazine.

I just got back from a short visit in the UK. A catalog from Alan
Schofield was waiting for me when I arrived, so I called and ordered up
a pair of the steel panels that go under your feet. Nice people, the
panels are only 18 pounds each (in British Sterling, not in weight). For
a reasonable but costly sum, I had them delived by next-day-courier to
my address in Bristol.

The only problem is that the courier company didn't come through, and by
6:00 pm, I was worried. (I assumed that the delivery would happen before
6:00) so I phoned back to Schofield and discussed my options. I know how
whenever a shipment must absolutely, positively be there the next day,
it never is, so I wasn't angry with the shop. We made alternative plans
to ship the panels by surface mail whenever.

However, we did get a chance to discuss the issue of availabilty of
panels through the US agent. He (no, I didn't get his name) said that
advertisements could be seen in Hot VW's. Did I read that magazine? he
asked. I explained that I rarely did, that it rarely had anything nice
to say about Bay Windows, had too much pink Cal Look and
silicone-enhanced bathing beauties and not enough daily driver practical
stuff. &quot;What about VW Trends?&quot; he asked. 'Same story' I replied. I told
him that for us old VW Camper owners, that those magazines were just not
on our radar at all. I told him that I preferred to read Volks World,
and that I was a LiMBO member. Anyway, nice guy, great to deal with. I
highly recommend the firm.

After 7:00 pm, the panels arrived. The next morning I got on the British
Airways flight to San Francisco. That was last night.
I haven't even unwrapped the box with the panels yet.
