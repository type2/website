&gt; Hi Erin,
&gt; 
&gt; Just out of curiousity, did you ever get the engine/$$$ situation with 
&gt; the guy in CO straightened out?  I once replied to a sale post of his  
&gt; with questions about a type 3 he was parting but never got a reply.

Nope, never did.  I kind of chocked it up to experience, however, I still 
have not talked to the original guy I dealt with - only his &quot;buddy&quot;.  I 
am still giving him the HUGE benefit of the doubt and guessing that this 
guy will be back in law school once fall rolls around and if he doesn't 
make good, I'll email his original posts to his deans as well as sending 
hardcopy printouts to them.  That should take care of it.

&gt; 
&gt; How did you stumble upon this bus?  Keep us up to date, I always enjoy 
&gt; reading your posts.
&gt; 

We've known the family for years.  Originally, my grandma and grandpa 
knew these people.  They had a deaf son and since my dad is deaf, it was 
only natural that since they lived in neighboring towns and went to the 
same church, that the families hung out together.  I can vaguely remember 
that Edith (the good ol' gals' name) and my folks met in York, NE for 
some reason and I got to ride in a &quot;funny car that had the engine in the 
back and sounded different.&quot;  Well, you guessed it - No Quarter's first 
ride in a VW was before he went to Kindegarten (a German word by the way) 
:-).

Years went by and I actually made fun of bugs with such statements as 
&quot;real people don't drive bugs&quot; - (OUCH!), and &quot;it sounds like there is a 
chain whapping around back there.&quot;  I confess, it was shameful statements 
like this that should have barred for life from the VW world but once 
again I was forgiven and saved by youth, ignorance, and not knowing any 
better.

One day it was brought up at the dinner table that &quot;Edith&quot; drove bugs and 
was actually almost killed when she hit ice in Minnesota, careened down a 
ditch, rolled several times, and was layed up for months due to back 
problems.  My mom suggested I go down someday and visit her.

So last October I did and that's when I found the bus.  I'd never been 
that close to one so I instantly fell in love with it.  Edith gave me a 
good deal with the idea of me not &quot;reselling&quot; it for profit.  She has my 
assurance that I will keep it and get it running.  Should I ever want to 
sell it, I personally think it would only be fair to inform her, give her 
the chance to buy it back, or give her some of the proceeds.  He kids 
have grown up and moved away although they come back frequently to 
visit - usually on weekends.  She had fond memories (related to me with a 
sparkling in her eyes) of how she and her late husband toured all over 
Colorado, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, you name it, in this 
bus.  She said it's seen a lot of miles and they had a lot of good times 
in it.  When I get it running, I'll take it back down and give her a ride.

The neat thing is that I can say with 99% assuredness, that this will be 
the only bus on the road in Gage County.  I *NEVER* see Ghia's, 
TypeIII's, or even busses down here. The one I used to see evidently had 
severe engine problems and they guy either keeps it in a shed or sold it 
off.  It was a bay window though so I will get lots of looks when I get 
it running because splitties are just not seen on the roads here.  I am 
sure a lot of kids will ask me what it is when they see it tooling around.

So that, my friend, is the whole story of how this Nebraska born boy 
ended up with a VW bus.  I can't explain why I like them nor do I want to 
find an explanation, for if one tries to explain fetishes, hobbies, etc. 9 
times out of 10 it will spoil the whole thing.  I've got a good thing going.

BTW:  I called the fella on the farm tonight and told him that Wednesday 
evening I'll be rolling in late with a bus and years worth of rent 
money.  He said that's great, fine, and dandy.  I think if I get him a 
six pack of beer, he'll really think I'm keen.  But I think he deserves it...

Slater and thanks for asking!
