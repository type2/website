Flack alert! ;-)

In the many VW cables I've replaced I noticed this:  The German cables last
longest. They last even longer when sufficiently greased with moly.  Longer
still if adjusted properly. Many if not most failures result from incorrect
handling, maintenance and *adjustment* and that goes for gas pedals as well.
My 71 Bus original gas pedal and cable are still working perfectly.  Not
only do gas pedals and cables break under excessive stress (no slack at the
throttle valve under full throttle or missing bowdens etc.) the throttle
shaft will eventually eat into its housing.  Too much return spring pressure
aggravates this as well.  Grease and adjust properly and even a Brazilian
cable will last a good long time.  Chincy design work?  For shame!!  ;-)

Ric
I remember this...the cable snapping in the middle of nowhere...finally i
ended up not using the stock doodoo cable at all.  I got some braided
stainless cable (500 lb test)
and steel cable connector's, the kind with screws in them (all at the
hardware store for about $12) shot some wd40 stuff down the hole, added an
extra spring at the accellerator lever under the floorboard and never had to
think or worry about it breaking again, that was 5 years ago.  I have often
had to improve on some of the chincy design work vw did. (I expect to
receive
some flack from this last comment)...but I did the same for the gas
pedal.._dot_used a door hinge cause the stock hinge is also doodoo...
