&gt;There is absolutely no reason, even monitary, that should induce you
&gt;to put yourself through the torture that a Brazilian muffler will give.


Personally, I have to agree.  The difference in quality is substantial.
Unless you simply can't afford the relatively small difference in price, buy
the Leistritz.  I offer the Brazilian one in order to provide a cheap
alternative to the Taiwanese extractor systems (which make even the
Brazilian muffler look good), but personally would only put a German muffler
on my own bus. Eight out of ten of my customers buy the Leistritz. The other
two are typically either planning to sell the bus soon anyway, or simply
unwilling to believe me when I tell them the Leistritz is worth the
difference.  (They learn. :-)  Also, make sure your other exhaust parts are
good. If not, there is also a complete kit for $119. This includes the rest
of the pipes and hardware, such as the damper pipe, tailpipe, bracket,
mounting kits, etc. The muffler is German, and most of the other parts
either German or Danish (with the possible exception of the tailpipe, which
is often either Danish or Brazilian because German ones are sometimes
unavailable or overpriced).
