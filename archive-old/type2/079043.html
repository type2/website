&gt;It's normal.  friction puts a little torque on the output shaft from the

I guess I have to differ. I don't recall any creeping as normal. Now, I
would verify that someone didn't put 140wt gear oil in the tranny, which
could cause this. Or low on gear oil might do it. I would dump the gear oil
and replace with 80/90wt GL-4 and see if it just don't go away. If it
remains very subtle and doesn't get worse, I wouldn't worry about it. If it
progresses and gets worse, likely the pilot bearing. If it is the pilot
bearing it certainly will get worse, and in hundreds not thousands of miles.
