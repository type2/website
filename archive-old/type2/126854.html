Subject: F.I. part needed-tons to trade!

Hey Y'all,
I need the rubber air intake hose that goes from the
AFM to the F.I. throttle body on a F.I. bus. See the
link for exact picture.  I have a TON of bay and split
parts I can trade or buy outright.  Can also pick up
or deliver parts to Everybus. Here's the link:

Thanks!
