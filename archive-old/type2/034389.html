Subject: stock heat

&lt;&lt;I live in Granite City IL, about 4 miles from Mo Via
HYW 270 and work in the St. Louis area. Where are you
at? Do you get enough heat out the heater boxes? even
with assisted by an online fan?
Alex&gt;&gt;


as always, some will say the stock heat system sucks.  for the most
part it does, because nobody ever kept them working correctly.  if all
the boxes, flaps, cables and hoses are intact and not rotted and
function correctly, you will have adequate heat.

note i said ADEQUATE.  don't expect to run out in a pair of shorts and
expect to stay warm in your van.  i have disconnected my stock blower
fan and don't use it at all.  and my van is a daily driver, and i have
adequate heat.  (my little flaps in the blower are AWOL and was losing
heat out the blower itself...those who have them will know what i am
talking about...so i disconnected and blocked off the hose
connections...)

back to the task at hand...i guess it depends on how much of the
heater components you are missing in your bus.  either way by the time
you get either the stock system all pieced back together OR buy a
propane (or your choice) of furnace system it will be almost spring. 
i am not saying forget it, but do you have the time to hunt down parts
at a junkyard?  or a heated garage to work at your leisure?  or do you
have another car to drive will you get the heat system working in your
van??  weigh your options.

my wife drives a 74 super beetle DAILY for years!  yes the heat system
does work fine when kept in complete running order.  she does have a
1/2 hour drive to work so it heats up just fine on the drive.

i live in omaha ne.  so i guess i wont be of much help to come over
and give you a hand.  maybe ask around, some listee may live close by.

hope that helps a little.
