Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield Wiper Tank/Hose Leak

If it is anything like i just did on my 82 westy, it isnt fun.  the one 
on my drivers side was a pain to repair and then to get the hose out for 
the passenger side was worse.  I ended up doing a lot of dissassembly 
and 4 bandaids.  Mine ran right under the dash right below the 
windshield with the line from the tank coming up just to the inside of 
the driver side spray to a tee fitting.  My hose was so brittle that 
fixing on section broke the next.

&gt; upon charging up my windshield wiper tank in my '71 Westy after the
&gt; winter, I heard a leak and hiss from behind the kick panels - I dove in
&gt; there and found that the hose leading from the windshield wiper fluid 
&gt; tank
&gt; was cracked and broken, and in need of replacement. However, it leads up
&gt; under a maze of stuff in the dash and disappears... No diagrams or 
&gt; mention
&gt; in Bentley or Muir.
&gt;
&gt; Is this an easy thing to do, replacing the hose? It looks like it 
&gt; isn't...
