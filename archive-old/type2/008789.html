&gt; Put down an acid neutralizing blanket from the FLAPs and promise
yourself you'll inspect this more
&gt; frequently in the future so you never have to do this again!

By the time an inspection shows damage in this area it is probably too
late!  Better to install a plastic battery box such as those used by
the boat folk.  Boxes are available at most FLAPS
