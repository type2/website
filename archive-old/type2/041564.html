Subject: rotten beam fix?

Hi, I just got a hold of a bus that has a rusted out beam but is otherwise
quite driveable. It is a 78 transporter. The lower beam tube has come loose
from the support thing?. It rattles. Can this type of damage be welded or
does the beam have to be replaced. Basically, I would like to salvage this
bus but not to the cost of replacing the beam. Any comments?
Bob
