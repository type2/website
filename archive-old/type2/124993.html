Subject: RE: [T2] bus won't run (will start)

Hey hey, I've converted some scanned Fuel Injection books into PDF
format. You can get 'em off my computer at www.monkeybones_dot_net/76bus
Some of the pages are kinda blurry, but you can make it all out. I would
point you to the originals and give credit for the scans, but I'm lazy
and don't wanna go hunting for 'em. :) 

One of the two books I have their has a good flow chart it to
troubleshoot with. Is your coil getting power when the key is in the
running position? I'm thinking maybe it's some small electrical error
somewhere. Btw, monkeybones is on my home computer, and I've got Cable,
so the uploads are pretty pokey. Just FYI. :) 

Hope it helps
Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am going to go through the whole wiring in the 
engine bay this afternoon but I thought I would appeal to the mercy of 
the list and see if someone would point me in the right direction.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
