&gt; ...The later worm and roller type
&gt; boxes(73-79) are bulletproof, and I just ordered a brand new TRW box from
&gt; California Import Parts in BC.  The price at this time is $199USD or  $280
&gt; Canadian, not bad for a brand new box. They have free shipping for July,
&gt; plus 5% off for ordering online. The biggest advantage is since they ship
&gt; from Canada, you won't have to pay any duty to receive it, a big savings. US
&gt; orders are shipped from the US, they don't pay duty either.
&gt;  In order to fit it to your 72, you will need to drill 2 new holes through
&gt; your frame, (1 hole lines up already) and put tubes inside to prevent the
&gt; frame from buckling when you tighten the bolts up.

Have you completed this swap?  I was under the impression that the large
hole through the frame on the early bus was too small for the later box.
I hope that I am wrong on this, since the late boxes are so much better.

On the mounting bolts, you do need to add the tubes to prevent the frame
from being crushed, but you also have to make sure that the tubes are
firmly held to the frame metal on both ends, either by being bolted or by
being welded to the frame metal.  You can't just drill a big hole, slide
the tube in, and bolt things up, since the big hole will not properly
transmit the steering box loads to the frame unless the tube is securely
welded to the frame on the big hole end.

I've never seen a late model box wear out, so this might be a attractive
junkyard swap.
