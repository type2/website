&gt;In my futile attempt to get an accelerator pedal that won't stick, I think
&gt;I've found a new wrench in the works. My acc. pedal hinge (

&gt;be lifting off of the floor a bit. Not down where its welded, but where the
&gt;curl is that holds the pin. This results in my pedal being turned too far to
&gt;the right, thus throwing off all the linkage under the bus. Sounds good, eh
&gt;:)

Mine was like that - after all sorts of attempts to bend it straight, it 
dawned on me that what was causing it to stick was the rubber cab mat 
sliding into the gap! A little local rubber surgery fixed it completely.
