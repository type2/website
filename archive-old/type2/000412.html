	I recently did the same thing on my '71. Used a $5.00 foglight relay, mounted to the top mounting screw of the voltage regulator. Did the trick. I had installed a starter switch in the engine compartment (makes the same connection as the relay. That is, it connects the solenoid directly to the battery) which I will eventually remove (it's pigtailed to the relay) but it IS handy to be able to start the beast without hiking up to the driver's seat Again, ONLY if I'm SURE it's in neutral with the brake on.
