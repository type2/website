Subject: Cooling lessons learned.

Hello volks,
I am a new comer to the list and wanted to share a success story which is 
directly related to information obtained from this very informative sight.
I have been driving a plain vanilla 1600cc 71 bay window since 1990 or so and 
have had the displeasure of having to pull the motor more times than I can 
remember for everything from broken valves to broken pistons and eventually a 
bad bearing on the crank.
I never gave up. I had been told that VW designed the engine NOT to last and 
the parts were cheap to replace so I kept at it.
After all I paid $350 for the bus and brought the engine home in a wheel 
barrow so my investment was small.
Along the way I have learned many lessons about air cooled engines and 
patience.
I am still learning.
My engine has run hot since the beginning and I had made many changes along 
the way some good and some not so good.
I was always content to just drive it and repair as needed.
Finally I discovered Type2_dot_com and my eyes were opened.
I was looking at postings regarding &quot;Cooling&quot; looking for the answer to my 
woes and found reference to the Gene Berg Ent. Dip stick oil temperature 
sensor which hooks up to the oil light sender unit and if your temp rises to 
225 the light begins to flicker or glow and if the oil temp goes higher the 
light goes to a steady glow telling you to pull over and give it a rest or 
your engine studs will start to pull out of the case and permeant damage can 
occur ect.
I thought I had a small cooling problem but this sensor told me my problem 
was more serious as the engine was over heating on the freeway after just 
10-15 miles at 65mph.
I had to go 60mph and hope there were not any hills!
I had already covered the basics.
New Carb and Dizzy properly adjusted and timed, valves adjusted, good 
compression 
proper oil cooler fan and shroud.
But wait, I had never considered the engine compartment must have positive 
pressure to keep the hot air from reentering the engine compartment and 
recirculating over the engine.
I learned about the &quot;Positive pressure&quot; from posts to the list.
In the beginning of my bus life I had disconnected the hot air duct to the 
air cleaner and put on an open element air cleaner and removed the heater 
boxes years ago and plugged the fan shroud with freeze plugs to provide more 
air to cool the cylinders. I live in sunny So. California so I don't need the 
heater, oh yea and I didn't like the smell of burning oil entering the 
passenger compartment. 
Problem: I never covered the 2&quot; dia. holes in the tin where the ducting used 
to go! 
Solution: I used the lids off 3 frozen juice cans and drilled a hole in the 
middle and added a cross brace which slips thru the hole in the tin and 
screwed them together sandwiching the tin between the disk and the brace 
blocking the flow of hot air into the engine compartment!
Viola! Instant dramatic results!
I never feel a loss of power due to heat and the light never even flickers.
I can travel 30 miles or more at speeds of 65-70 and never get any hotter 
than 212 estimated temp.
I still need to add the tin where the heat exchangers have been replaced with 
J tubes just to be sure but I believe I have slayed the beast!
Soon I will be driving 60 miles and over a pass which will push my bus to the 
limits and I am eager to see how well it performs.
Bottom line is if you combine all the elements of a well set up engine and 
consider all the possibilities you can reach your goal for a cool running 
engine with sufficient power and lots of driving pleasure.
If you know where to look for the info your chances for success will be 
multiplied!
Thanks to all the &quot;Gurus of the list&quot; for sharing their years of experience.
The VW bus is not a cheap disposable source of transportation but a never 
ending source of experience, inspiration and frustration!
