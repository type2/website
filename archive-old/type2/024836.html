hello all volks folks!!

i posted a message a little bit ago asking how to identify the engine in my
'73 bus.  i was told to check the engine number. well here it is...it's
CB071120.  i must admit that i have no clue as to what that means...also, i
saw a starter (which i need) in a junk-yard the other day.  does it pay to
get a used one???  or should i just buy a new one???
