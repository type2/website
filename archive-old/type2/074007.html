Subject: Re: [T2] seat mounting bolts



&gt; Someone recently posted to the list that they were now carrying middle seat
&gt; mounting hardware. But I can't seem to find it at any of the vendors that
&gt; frequent the list. I tried searching the archives but the &quot;most recent 1000
&gt; posts&quot; search doesn't seem to work at all, and the older archives pulls up
&gt; peoples requests for this hardware.

Here is a vendor on that auction site that has them:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=596996964&amp;r=0&amp;
t=0


&gt; Also, what years were full width solid back middle seats available? I can
&gt; only seem to find the 1/3-2/3 folding back wide middle seat upholstery.

Solid back???  I have never seen solid back full middle seats. Either right 1/3
flip for right cargo doors or left 1/3 flip for left cargo doors or both ends
flip for double doors.
