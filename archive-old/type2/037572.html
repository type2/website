Subject: Re: Camshaft Gear Rivet Failures

Tim,

I think if you pull the oil pump cover plate off and then have someone move
the flywheel while you watch, you may be able to detect play in the
camshaft. Absent of that, I would say you're probably stuck. I don't recall
if you can see the rivets once you remove the oil pump.

The last cam I bought was through Bus Depot. It was a TRW cam with no gear
attached. I had an operation here in Memphis attach my old gear to the
camshaft using some low-profile bolts. They had to find the right bolts and
then tap the camshaft to attach the gear. The name of the the place is
Competition Cams. They do work for a lot of NASCAR race car drivers and
they treated me just like I was Richard Petty or something. I'm sure if you
drop them a line or give them a call, they'll be happy to help you out. I
think they charged me $10 or $15 for the whole job and they probably had
$20 in the bag of 100 low-profile bolts they had to buy. A real class act
from start to finish. Unfortunately, they don't sell cams for buses as far
as I know (they're mostly a race car operation).

Good luck! Joe

&gt;I've got a rebuilt '79 type IV engine (18 months ago) with about 6500 miles
&gt;on it.  It runs well, has power etc.  I've got a ticking noise, similar to
&gt;a collapsed lifter, except a little quieter (but getting louder) and at a
&gt;higher frequency... like each time the engine fires.  Investigation with a
&gt;stethescope points directly to the oil pump area.  A few months back I read
&gt;about camshaft gear rivet failures so I checked the archives.  Sure enough,
&gt;seems to be all too common.
