Subject: 1975 VW Add-A-Room (Tent) FS

As  the message header says I am thinking of selling my 1975 Add-A-Room (Tent). 
It is is very good condition (not 100% perfect for you complete fanatics but very 
close)

Plusses

- - very minimal usage no holes (in canvas,floor mosquito netting) anywhere, _very 
minor_ blotches where I might have squished a mosquito or something
- -complete (i.e. has all poles, pegs, guy wires etc.)
- -fabric is unfaded, rubber strip that attaches drip rail still very pliable

Minusses

- --is missing tent bag
- -one corner pole has had a 1&quot; metal brace welded in to reinforce formerly 
slightly bent pole

I would like $375 US for it, but am willing to entertain other offers. Shipping would 
be extra. I could prolly scan in some pics to attest to its condition but it looks like 
the tent pictured at Joe Clarks's page..
