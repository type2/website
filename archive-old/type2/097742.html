&lt;&lt; I see where Bentley
&gt;indicates shims can be used but I think this only helps with up/down and
&gt;fore/aft adjustment of the closed gap around the door, not the in/out
&gt;adjustment. Do I need a new roller on the bottom bracket to pull the
&gt;door in tighter when closed? If so where might I find one?
 &gt;&gt;

Check inside the track where the roller rolls...There's a sheet metal
guide coming down from the floor inside that track. At the passenger
door end (front), is it still there?
