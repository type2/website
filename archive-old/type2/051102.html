Subject: Re: [T2] e-brake fixed (fwd)

Volks,

An addition on this subject...  Howard Magen sent me an e-mail suggesting
that SPS Flexloc nuts were very appropriate for the purpose of keeping
the parking brake lever afixed to the brake shoe.  I did a little looking
around and their web site is:

http://192.215.160.123/sps/admin.html

The flexloc nuts look very appropriate for this application and should be
&quot;available from most any industrial fastener distributor or jobber&quot; as
Howard suggested to me.

In addition, in the past I bought a box of &quot;copper exhaust nuts&quot; that
turned out to be wretched as exhaust nuts but would probably be wonderful
in this application.  They had a slot cut into the side of the nut and the
crown of the nut was then bent down to provide a locking force.  The
problem is that the copper turned out to be coating on plain steel nuts,
which rusted badly inside a year.  I gave up on them after that and have
no idea of the manufacturer.  Indeed, I would give thes pups a hearty &quot;not
recommended&quot; on their advertised application... in exhaust applications,
go for stainless!!  But I would say that any all-metal locking nut would
work on the parking brake lever.  If you can't find one, at least deform
the threads on (peen) the bolt. You do *not* want that nut coming adrift
inside the brake area!
