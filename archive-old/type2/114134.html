Subject: Re: [T2] what years are diesel engines available

Vanagons had diesels. No aircooled diesels or baywindow buses came with 
diesels.

&gt;There is a course at a local community college in the area that converts 
&gt;diesel engines to biodiesel (grease cars) Any way, I was wondering what 
&gt;years the diesel engine was available for buses?
&gt;Is it difficult to put a diesel engine in body that was originally set up 
&gt;for a gasoline engine?

No.

Good luck.

My recommendation would be to find a Tatra engine... Google that.
