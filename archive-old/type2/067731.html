What is it about mail order auto parts?  How hard can it be to do it right?
 RMMW excepted, I can count on my order being fouled up in some way or
another.  Being an Alaskan, mail order is a way of life for me.  I have
great luck with all sorts of mailorder companys--except VW parts.  When my
wrong order of VW parts arrives, I can count on dealing w/a foul-mouthed
(not swearing at me, just as punctuation) idiot who couldn't careless. 
RMMW has great service but premium prices.  

Ken, you had at one point mentioned that you were going to set up a web
page with experiences dealing with different vendors.  Is this plan still
in the works?
