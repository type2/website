Subject: 2nd Battery in 77 Westy

Howdy! Looks like my new 77 westy is designed to have a second battery. This 
one came with an electric fridg and h2o pump. In testing the pump there is 
is no juice flowing. Does the second battery have to be installed for this 
to work? I'd like to get the fridg running, but I guess the first step is 
power.

I see where the 2nd battery should go, there's even a plastic tray there, 
but there are no connections for it. There is a b &amp; w pair that is cutoff 
there that leads past the spare tire well towards the fridge, but it's only 
14 gauge, 12 at most. Certainly this would not have hooked to the battery? 
Normally where would these leads originate? Does this not hook up to the alt 
for charging? Should my battery be help down with a bracket, or is gravity 
good enough?

Also in dealing with the westy cabinets did they design them with the idea 
that no one would ever need to get inside to make changes? I want to replace 
the hoses to the water pump, but I don't want to destroy the wood in front 
of it. I pulled the pin that keeps the wood from coming out, but now what, 
it's locked in at the top. Just rip it out, or is there a better way?

Many thanks!
Marvin

PS As for my sputtering fuel injection, looks like the fuel filter is chunky 
(I just changed it 2 weeks ago) and the fuel tank is full of rust. I guess 
I'll pull the tank and have it cleaned and sealed. This bus sat in barn for 
4 years and has issues.

Thanks for all the help. I'm sure I'll need more. This is a bigger project 
than I thought, but I'm having fun!
