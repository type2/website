&gt;hi, I am planning on running a pair of weber 40 dcnfs on a 1600dp in a
&gt;71 westy.  My question is where should I drill my manifold(s) for the
&gt;booster hose.

Doesn't really matter.  I've seen both right below the throttle plate
(Weber) and right above the junction with the cylinder head (stock Solex).

&gt;Also do I need to drill both manifold or just one.

Again, I've run both ways.  I feel better pulling from both manifolds, but
if you do that, you are effectively connecting them together which may or
may not affect how the engine runs.

&gt;also
&gt;what diameter hose should i run off one or both of the manifolds.

Minimum 1/4&quot; or 6mm.  Most applications are a bit larger than this but I
can't for the life of me remember the sizes.  Remember to use thick hose
that will not collapse.
