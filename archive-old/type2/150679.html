&amp;gt; I use acetone everyday to remove nail polish. We use it to mask off
&amp;gt; areas we are gold plating. One time I didn't have acetone so I used nail
&amp;gt; polish. It took a lot longer to remove the nail polish. My point being,
&amp;gt; that even if women use nail polish everyday, the concentration isn't as
&amp;gt; strong (I assume. I'm a jeweler not a chemist)

Nail polish remover often has oils added to counter the drying action of
acetone.  Some nail polish removers are pure acetone.  The label usually
tells which is which by using the word &amp;quot;moisturizing&amp;quot; or somesuch.
