&gt; hey folks,
&gt; does anyone know of a source for a torque converter seal for a 79
&gt; automatic camper?  I've checked bus depot and bus boys and come up
&gt; empty.   tx, greg

bus depot usually has em, I get em there whenever I need em, may not be in
the catalog but call the regular phone number, not the 800 number they are
about 5 bucks,  have you ever changed one before??
