Subject: Re: [T2] Compression

looks good to me.....
  was it a cold test or had the engine been ran first?

  Hey all:


Bently only says if compression is below 70 valves need to be ground.
Looked thru all the archives, couldn't find anything on good averages
for a 2.0.

I tested:

125
145
135
125

Is this OK for a rebuilt '79?

I did read on Ratwell a tolerance of 10% difference is acceptable,
anything more may be a sign of valve trouble.

Thank as always for your thoughts.
