&gt; Harbor Freight carries two transmission jacks that I've had my eye on. I

&gt; The 450 lb. jack is a scissors-type lift similar to the motorcycle lift

I have this jack and have used it several times to yank my 2Liter engine
solo, I did have to use an extender bar to start it &quot;up&quot; from the all the
way down position because the mechanical leverage is quite low in that
position,  not a jack I would use for a production garage but it is well
worth the $$.   

&gt; The 1 Ton jack is a standard rolling-type jack fitted with a 
&gt; transmission platform and safety chain. The tilt of the platform can be 
&gt; adjusted. The jack is made of pressed steel construction.

I looked at that one and didn't think the standard jack had a wide enough
base to handle an engine if it wasn't perfectly centered.

I do plan on spending the $200+ to get a hydraulic tranny jack in the very
near future,

the seperate tranny jack has come in handy in some many unexpected ways
that I would reccomend having one around the garage for 1,000 and one
little jobs,  I've used mine to put in the front axle beam, to move doors
around and even as an adjustable height rolling seat, with a piece of wood
bolted to the top.

&gt; could share. The construction on some of the lower end pressed steel 
&gt; jacks is &quot;ify.&quot;

well the jack is &quot;rated&quot; 450lbs the VW engine is about 250 or so, don't
think I would put much more than the 250 on it that is for sure.
