Hello,

I am having a problem with the front disk brakes on my 71

westy.  They are continually clamped hard on the rotor.  When 

driving this causes both sides to smoke and it becomes harder 

and harder to drive.  I rebuilt the calipers and bolted them

back up and bled the brake lines, but it still happens.  Could

it possibly be the lines, calipers or the fact that the brake

booster is not working properly and had been removed from the

vacuuum on the motor.  I am at a loss I thought rebuilding the 

calipers would solve it.

Any help would be appreciated.

Stephen 
71 Westy
