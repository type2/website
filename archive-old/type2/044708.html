The idle cutoff solenoid is also an idle jet.  55 is the size of the jet.
On your old carb, someone has replaced the solenoid/jet combo with just a
jet.  I did the same on one of my carbs and will do the other one when I
find another 55 jet.  Less wire in the engine compartment and it works the
same.  Older single-carb engines had the simple jets from the factory, but
I'm not sure what years.  I think the solenoids were installed to prevent
run-on but it doesn't seem to make a difference with my bus.
