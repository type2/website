Subject: Transferring ownership from Canada to Texas

This was posted on the Vanagon list.   I figure someone else with a 
type2 bus has already gone through this procedure. If anyone has 
information, please reply to Gary directly.

&gt;I was looking at a 1972 VW van that is in Austin TX but it is titled 
&gt;in Vancouver Canada---anyone have any experience in transferring 
&gt;titles from Canada to the USA?
