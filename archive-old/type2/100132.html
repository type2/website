&gt; 1)    Will the Pertronix work in the 70 vacuum dizzy?

There is an 1847A for the 009 and 1847V (or sometimes just 1847) for the
vacuum models.  I'd like to know what the difference is also.  At least they
seem to be different in size: http://www.w-p-c_dot_com/009.jpg

&gt; 2)    What thickness is the feeler gauge for the Pertronix, and what can be
&gt; substituted for it to set the gap correctly?

I believe it's .030&quot;.

I asked the list about the gap a while back and the consensus was that the
gap doesn't affect the dwell.  All that matters is that the module clear the
magnetic sleeve so that it doesn't rub.
