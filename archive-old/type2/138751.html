Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Issue Revisited

&gt; &gt; The shop is saying either the CHT sensor, or the
&gt; &gt; AFM.
&gt; &gt;

&gt;
CLifford points out some good suggestions. Iwould like to follow up by 
saying don't let your shop guess their way through fixing your busses 
problems. They may be correct in thinking the problem is in the fuel 
delivery system ie. CHT sensor, afm, etc.. The point I am trying to make is 
that there are specific test procedures that, if followed, will tell you or 
your mechanic exactly what part has failed. Some, if not most of the fuel 
injection parts are rather pricy. I don't like the idea of hunting and 
pecking to find the source of a problem. It's toooo hard on the wallet and 
the source of most of the bad attitude about fuel injection. Every manual I 
have read outlines the procedures of troubleshooting the fuel injection 
system, some better than others, but most all, well enough.

Clifford explained some of the procedures of troubleshooting the AFM. There 
is also a test involving the use of a multimeter to check the variable 
resistance of the afm. I would guess that this is not your busses problem. 
Typicaly if the variable resistor fails, the AFM develops spots that have 
infinite resistance or what is known as an open. This condition causes 
coughing and sputtering during acceleration and possible stalling from lack 
of fuel delivery when the vane in the AFM moves over an open spot. Lack of 
fuel will not cause smoke.

The temp sensors can also be tested with a multimeter. The one your mechanic 
is probly describing as a possible culprit is called the temp sensor II. Its 
screwed into the drivers side cylinder head near number 3 cylinder. If the 
lead from the sensor is disconnected from the wiring harness a multi meter 
can be used to measure the resistance of the sensor. At 68 deg f the 
resistance should be about 2500 ohms. As the sensor warms up the resistance 
should change. IF the sensor passes the test it's also a good idea to 
reconnect the lead to the wiring harness and remove the harness plug from 
the ECM and measure the sensors resistance at the plug. This helps to verify 
that the harness is in good/bad condition. If the resistance read at the ECM 
plug differs much from the readings at the sensor you may have a wiring 
problem.

To continue, you may have a failed fuel injector or cold start valve. These 
can also be proven good/bad with tests outlined in the manuals.

If you and/or your mechanic don't have a multimeter. some basic testing can 
be done after checking the vane in the AFM. Disconnect the lead from the 
temp sensor and start the engine if you can. Does it still smoke? No? the 
sensor is probly the problem. Yes? The sensor is probly ok.

The point of all this is that you or your mechanic should be following an 
established troublshooting procedure The Bentley manual is probly the best 
you can get but there are also som web sites that hace scans ot the original 
Bosch fuel injection manuals that describe all you need in testing the fuel 
injection system.
Hope this helps,

Tom
