Subject: Re: [T2] My Kid's New 74 Bus

Hi Bill,

This is a great Friday post, I'll be watching the responses on this 
one, since I recently bought my wife a bus of her own.

Here's my list for you:

#1. FUEL LINES. Inspect and replace if required ASAP.
#2. Structural integrity - Esp. frame and the front beam, but also 
inspect floors and sliding door parts.
#3. Brakes.
#4. Steering.
#5. Tires. Look for proper load rating and 2-ply sidewalls.
#6. Suspension.
#7. Exhaust leaks - Probable cause of backfires on decel.
#8. Vacuum Leaks- Possible cause of other carburation issues, and 
oft-neglected by P.O's.
#9. Compression test. Get the values recorded now and you'll have a 
benchmark to refer to in the future if performance changes. Make sure 
to adjust the valves beforehand.
#10. Steering coupler. It's a rubber coupling at the bottom of the 
steering column, under the cover plate. It could possibly be 29 years 
old, and may need attention.

The very next purchase he makes from eB_at_y should be a Bentley manual. 
Or get one NEW, directly from one of the resellers on the list.

Happy trails,

&gt; My son bought a 74 Bus off of e-bay.  He has been driving it for about 
&gt; a week.  Apart from some backfiring when it first starts up and 
&gt; cosmetics, its appears to be in good running order.  It came with new 
&gt; carbs, new tires and a year old battery.
&gt;
&gt; Immediate needs to buy or schnore are a passenger side rear view 
&gt; mirror, a rim for the spare tire, and an antenna.
&gt;
&gt; He says he is going to restore it, which will be cool if he does.  I 
&gt; was wondering what you guys would recommend as the top ten list of 
&gt; things to check out and make sure are in working order for an old bus 
&gt; like this.
