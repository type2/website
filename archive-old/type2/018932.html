Having owned and sometimes lived in VW busses over the years, one of my
'hobbies' is MacGyver-ing the already excellent and well thought out interior
into something truely livable. I am planning to set up a web site with this,
and Free Parking (who likes to pay $12 a nite to sleep in a parking lot) as
their themes.

I like keeping the soft bags of 'Blue Ice' in the freezer section packed
pretty solid. They freeze up nicely on a four to five hour drive, and keep
the fridge cool for days afterward.

Has anyone tried putting solar cells on the roof? I wonder if enough amperage
can be drawn to keep systems going, as I recall the fridge draws about 8
amps.

&gt; . Has any one found a module cooling unit that could be mounted
&gt; in a Westy icebox? The result would be a dual source unit with 12v
&gt; supplying cooling while traveling and thereby extending the life of the
&gt; ice block and then while camping the ice block would continue to cool
&gt; while the engine is off. When in a campground hooked to 110v the adapter
&gt; that is sometimes supplied with the cooler would continue electrical
&gt; operation. There appears to be sufficient space at the rear of the
&gt; icebox for the module robbed from a cooler,fan,and necessary air flow.
