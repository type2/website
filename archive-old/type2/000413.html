&lt;Can I add oil until I can get around to repairing/replacing it?&gt;


	I don't see why not. When I had mine out I drained it and used 90 weight gear oil to refill it.

	I also replaced the seals. Had NO luck finding them through any VeeDub source but the original seals (if you clean them up and look carefully enough) have the id, od and depth on them in mm. Call around a few bearing supply houses. They might need to ship them in, but they'll find them somewhere. Good luck getting that swing arm off.

	Spend the money for the right puller (mine cost about $35.00). I broke it once anyway (one of the bolts holding the clamp arm on). You'll probably also need heat where the arm is on the steering box spline. With the puller torqued and the area nice and warm, give the side of the arm/fitting a solid PING with a hammer. Try it again. Try it again. Cry a little. Skin your knuckle on the frame and get it over with. Beg. It'll come.
