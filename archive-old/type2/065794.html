I hope we all feel bad about this; I'm sure we do. I have often wondered if
there's a logical solution to this problem. I suppose transplanting a more
emissions-compliant engine is an obvious approach. We all need to be mindful
of this problem. No one else has a significant financial or political reason
to work toward solving the emissions problem in any other way than by
calling for the decomissioning of older vehicles. If the standards folks
(gobmint) look only at emissions test results and not for the little
charcoal canisters and such, folks like KEP (those who make adaptors), could
probably be the ones who have the largest impact in keeping more buses on
the road after 2000.

I hate even suggesting replacing my beloved air-cooled engine, but if it
meant the difference between driving or not...or breathing unassisted or
using an oxygen tank...I'd have to opt out.

As nice a group as we are, our 400+ members don't have a large enough voice
to effect significant change through our words; though we might effect
change through significant deeds. I sure hope one of you comes up with the
clean burning petrol replacement that makes these issues moot!

Thanks! Joe
