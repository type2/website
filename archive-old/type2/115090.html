Subject: Re: [T2] A Rick Taylor question

I'd have to measure the pipe, it's out in the shop, but it was just a bit
larger than the bearing hub, then turned down to fit.  I also bore the
inside of the pipe to make it smooth for the grease seal.

Being an old shop teacher, I can buy at the wholesale plastics supply here
in town that I purchase my nylon from, it's not cheap, but you don't need
much.  If you have ever worked with nylon, it really is nice to turn in a
lathe, very smooth to work, but has high wear resistance in use.

I really am sorry I haven't made any more of these, but I have been adding
on to my machine shop here at home to produce such things as this and other
stuff for busses I have developed.  Just this past month I have purchased an
overhead BridgePort mill and a duplicating pattern torch.  I want my
products to be quality made, not just thrown together.

When you get one of my combination rear wheel bearing and CV packing tools,
I hope you agree they were worth the wait.

Again, I'm sorry, I should keep my mouth shut until I could produce them,
but I was so excited at how easy and well this worked on my bus and others I
have loaned this tool out to, I just wanted to share.


&gt;&gt; it was Rick Taylor &amp; his post is linked here:

&gt; Rick, (&amp; everybody)
&gt; 
&gt; What was the nominal diameter of the schedule 80 pipe used in your
&gt; description? Any idea on the nylon bar stock? Where can you find this? It
&gt; sounds like a rod of nylon correct?
