I am not aware of an inverter as such ,,, but I have seen the DC power supplies
that operate the fridge from the AC mains , they are just a transformer with
diodes to convert to DC as a battery charger does...

Newmark Products Inc
Santa Fe Springs
California 90670

I have seen 2 models,, the 15R and the 20R 
one is rated at max 15amps DC, and the other 20amps DC  at 12volts

Best I can do.....

want pics,, let me know
