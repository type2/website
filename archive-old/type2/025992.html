Steve, I have really enjoyed our discussions about the type 1 vs the type 4
engines and I don't want to get into a heated shouting match, but no matter
what you do to a type 1 engine, it will not outlast a type 4 for very simple
reasons.  This is purely for educational purposes, right?

When they designed a type 4, they really &quot;beefed&quot; up the case, cylinders and
heads.  If you look at a stripped long block type 1 and type 4 side by side
you can easily see what I mean, the type 4 LOOKS stronger and it is.  Then
if you go clear down into the case and compare the cranks and more
importantly the bearings, you will see another BIG difference.  You can't
put those big of bearings on a type 1.  Also look at the cases themselves,
you will notice a big difference in where the head studs mount and the
ribbing between the cylinders.

Each time VW redisigned their aircooled engines, they made improvements,
heck, compare a 1600 dual port to a 1200!!!  Can you beef up a 1200 to make
it as strong and live as long as a stock 1600?  The type 4 engine is just
that much stronger, not just cc wise, but physically.

Thanks Steve, I have enjoyed talking with you.  And hey, I still have a
bunch of type 1's around here myself!!
 

&gt; Hmmm, all right you type 4 zealots just wait a minute ;-)  Remember we are
&gt; on the same air-cooled team here.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted there aren't many of 'em out there but let's examine a thoughtfully
&gt; modified type 1 engine (I hereby christen thee a T1-tm) on a par with a type
&gt; 4, or maybe just as bullet proof.  Much of the increased longevity in a T4
&gt; is simply due to full flow filtering and better cooling...easily
