Subject: Loose Axle Nut - preliminary autopsy results
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10106221054240.40551-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Well, years ago, I was watching this NASCAR race... there they go at 200
MPH... suddenly one of the cars shoots a plume of smoke and drifts into
the infield... later they asked what went wrong and the only answer was
&quot;the engine blew&quot;  Sometimes the damage is so severe that determining what
went first is impossible.

On my rear axle:
the back of the castellated nut was boogered;
both ends of the hub were boogered;
the inner race of the outer bearing was both boogered and split across.

That's as far as I pulled it apart, but I am sure that as I get deeper in,
I will find more wrong :-)  I flopped in a nice looking unit from a
junkyard here and will be on the road in no time :-) I am taking the unit
and a second spare home with me and will rebuild and install them over the
summer.  I will take some pics of the damage and post them when I do.
