  Hello
 The conversion was pretty easy..First off what year do you have..i was told
that after 73 the conversion wouldnt work with out changing the tranny
because of the gear ratio, I have no problem with my 72.  What i did was i
made sure i took all the wiring for the alternator ( voltage regulator)from
the donor vehicle.  Some basics, the tranny mounts for the later years buses
are pretty good. one in front and one in the rear. pre 72 had no tranny
mounts in the rear, just the engine mount and front tranny mount.  I dont
use an engine mount just bolt it up to the tranny and it holds it fine.
Begining..the clutch for the late buses are a little differnt. the throw out
bearings are bigger and dont work  actually its the bearing guide thats to
big to fit in the clutch, so i just used a clutch that belongs on to the
1700 engine and it worked fine.  One other thing i was told is that the
spindle shaft is to long..i cant really confirm or deny this because when i
tried to bolt the engine up it was like a 1/2 inch out, thought it was the
spindle being to long(was what i was told) so i cut it with a dremel tool a
1/2 inch, rounded the edges a little and tried it again, but, was still a
1/2 inch out.  thats how i found the throw out guide was the culprit.  Put
in the new clutch and it bolted up perfect..the whole job took me maybe 4
hours..and it was pretty easy. I would try it with out cutting the spindle
shaft if i was going to do it again, but its up to you. over all a pretty
easy conversion. the electrical was easy also not much to it if you have the
voltage regulator from the donor...I cant remember if i changed the starter
or not..i have a bunch of them..dont think so but you might have one on hand
from the donor.  One other thing after the new engine is in, is the tin for
cooling. that was a job i didnt look foward to doing but , it was pretty
easy too.  I used some scrap sheetmetal and cut it into 3 pieces.  one big
piece for the back, and two littlier pieces for the sides.
  I am real glad that i did the conversion, i love the 1600....if you have
anymore questions just email me back  i hope this helps
