Subject: [T2] Special recommendation- dual carb question

Hi folks!
I've got a 73 dual carb westy and I have heard there is a guy in the
Southbay that works on these alot.
Does anybody know who this might be? Or can you reccomend another mechanic
who can deal with it. I need a valve job at the
very least, and maybe a replacement engine....

Help?

_Liz
