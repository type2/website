&gt; I don't get it about the transaxle. It's a 71, right? Small nut and large nut
&gt; are terms for bug (001) type trans as used in pre- 68 type 2's. Your bus
&gt; doesn't have swing axles and reduction boxes does it?
Oops, 

I forgot to mention my trip was in my 61 bus in a fit of ego (thinking
everyone knew, heh. I'm not that important as i thought...)

I do mention my 71 for comparison, as it has a DP 1600 that NEVER
overheats.

I would have doubted the gagues but every time it got to 250 we had
problems with the fuel boiling out of the fuel pump (instant vapor
lock) and if you spit or put water on the case it boiled and
steamed. wether it was exactly 250-260 it was too darned hot!

peas,

Steve
