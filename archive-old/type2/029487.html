Volks,

I am tearing down an engine (1500 SP) for rebuild.  This is a block that I
was given with no known history.  From the condition of the rod bearings,
tho, I am fairly certain I know why it came out of whatever bus it was in
:-)

I took a bunch of pictures of the rod bearings for my information, then
decided to put them up, for information and to let you know what bad rod
bearings look like.  while I never heard this engine run, I am betting
that the last person to do so heard the rattle of rods every time he/she
stepped on the gas.
