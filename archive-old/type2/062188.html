Subject: Multuple duplicate messages

Hey everybody!

Are all of you getting a few extra copies of messages?  Not all of them,
but enough to really stretch out the reading time.  I have to sort them
by author and wipe out the duplicates or it takes me all day to sift
through everything!

Oh well, no biggie.

I just wanted to add a &quot;Welcome back you lucky so-and-sos&quot; to everybody
that made the trek to Inuvik.  I'm envious beyond words. &lt;.........&gt;

See?

L8R,
Bob J.
