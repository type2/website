&gt; When I fill the tank the needle will indicate that I have a full tank. So
&gt; far so good. After approximately 50 miles of driving the needle will drop
&gt; the the empty position. Common sense tells me that the tank isn't really
&gt; empty so about 150-200 miles later I will fill it up. Knowing very little
&gt; about the world of sensors, wiring and gauges I am guessing that the problem
&gt; is with the sensor because of the relation to filling the tank.

Yes it is your sending unit.   Mine was doing the same thing and I Just replaced it --works fine now.  I am not sure what year you have, but the sending units on the pre '73 have five bolts holding it in.  I can't imagine getting to them with out removing the tank or cutting an access hole.  I chose the access hole route and this was pretty easy.
