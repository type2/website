&gt; wrong he said he hooked everything up the same way the old came down i
&gt; need major help please from the list if you don't understand my letter i
&gt; would be more than glad to call someone to fully understand what i need
&gt; to do to correct the problem.

pretty much normal operation, there is a always just a little power
transmitted.

work on the idle getting it down to spec.  about 950rpm

if the bus is sitting on the ground and then it still does this then you
have a problem...
