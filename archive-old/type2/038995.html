Subject: Detroit and back in 52 hours... (trip report)

Volks,

as John Hartranft said, I failed in attempting to move the baton/hubcap
into the midwest :-(  I will try again, on a less ambitious scale, next
weekend.  What happened was this:

Recently John Anderson bought an '82 Vanagon Westy for a trip that he is
contemplating this summer.  The body was in excellent shape, but the
engien was dead.  And the bus was in Detroit an a John was In Morgantown,
WV.  Now over the years John has come to my aid in a big way any number of
times, driving 3-4 hours to do it!  So when he asked my assitance, I
volunteered very eagerly, despite the work life from hell.  I drove out to
Morgantown from Alexandria on Friday and picked up John and his spare
engine.  We departed Morgantown at about 3 and arrived in detroit at
10:30-11 with no real adventure.  The vanagon is running fine, if a bit
hot (still have that nagging lean condition, about which more at the
bottom of this post).  At the same time I picked John up, I picked up the
hubcap for transfer to John Hartranft near Detroit.  I had conversed with
him earlier and we had made limited arrangements that I would call him
whe I arrived.  Since we arrived so late, tho, I put off calling until the
morning.  

We awoke on Saturday morning and headed for the bus site, northwest of the
city (Keego Lake).  When we got there I looked in my pocket for the paper
with John Hartranft's name and number on it and it was nowhere to be
found. I figured that (a) it was irretrievably lost, or (b) I had left it
at the apt. we had stayed in the prior night... either way I had no way of
reaching John :-( We got to work on the V'gon and did get the dead engine
out and John's rebuildt installed.  there were no mjor problems, but there
were certainly a number of minor ones...  mating a manual trans engine to
an automatic is an adventure!!!  We wound up flopping the wiring harnesses
rather than use the one John had brought due to wiring uncertainties (the
Auto trans has a different AFM and brain, no decel valve, etc.)

Anyway, the job ran a bit longer than expectd and we were at work on in at
about 4:30 when I reached into my pocket (which I had previously searched)
and pulled out poor John Hartranft's number!  I called him at that point,
but he was out.  Called again at 6:00 and they were on their way out for
the evening. Bummer!!  We wrapped the bus up at about 8:00, turned the key
and it started first time!  Because I did need to be at work today (from
which office I write this), we went back to John A's friends apt , had
dinner and left (at ~10:00 PM). drove that night across Ohio and crashed
at ~2:00AM on the PA/OH border, completed the trip today and as of 11:00
this morning John was safely back in Morgantown.  As of 2:30, I was
ensconced at my desk and at work :-(

The trip back caused me to completely re-evaluate the MSHP engine.  I have
spent a year cursing the overheating, which is due to the L-jet's
hardwired knowledge that there are 2 liters of air going thru the engine
and injectig that much fuel, despite the larger displacement that this
engine possesses.  Last night and this moring, tho, following John in his
stock '82 with auto trans (and a spare 2L V'gon engine adding 300+ ls in
payload) I gained a whole new appreciation for what my engine can do.  I
had been unimpressed because I went from the 2L in a bay body to the  2.2L
in the Vanagon.  The final &quot;look and feel&quot; were very similar and I hought
something must be wrong, because the 2.2L i so much larger.   well, John's
'82 is the first time I have fealt it appropriate to label a bus as
&quot;terrifyingly underpowered&quot;  That bus would not top 65 at all and would
drop below 50 on any hill at all.  I suddenly felt like I was driving way
more power!!! :-)  Now it isn't really a fair comparison...  John's bus
has an auto trans and was carrying an extra engine, but still...  wow!!

At this point, with 20K miles on the engine, I am much more impressed with
its power, and have been impressed all along with the stamina and ability
to endure abuse from a true &quot;DPO&quot;.  I have beat it hard and it is hangin
together.  At the same time, I truly believe that, while it is a good
engien, it really needs dual carbs, not FI, to reach its potential and
thus, if I had this to do over, I would buy the stock size engine.  I
would buy from MSHP again, but I am confirmed in my predudice towards
stock by this experience.


On the hubcap, a couple points:

Because of the lost phone # and late finish, I missed the handoff, so I
have it.  I apologize to John (both of them)  My fault :-(

I am anxious to get rid of it and get it back on the road, specifically I
would love to get it heading west.  I think this is a terrific idea, and I
am ever so grateful to Chris Huff for taking on the management of it...
three chear for Chris!!!

My current plan is to get it to someone west of me (preferrable about 5
hours west) either in the Pittsburg, PA or Roanoke, VA area.  I would like
to do this on this coming weekend but, reality strikes, it is more likely
to be the following one.  Please communicate with Chris, the master of all
things hubcap and she will give me my marching orders.

If someone wants to pick it up from me here in the DC area and get it
heading west, that would, of course be even better :-)
