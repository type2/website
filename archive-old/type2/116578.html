--Sean,

Have you checked the quality of your spark at #3,4?

If air's getting to 1/2, I can't see how it would be denied at 3/4.

High Voltage wires plugged in tight?

Dist. Cap cleaned? No corrosion?

ground 3/4 wires on the frame/block and verify blue/yellow spark, no orange.

Was it a ground before on the &quot;no injector&quot; thread?

Be careful!

Billy

&gt;I've got the injectors working but still no fire in &gt;#3 and weak to no fire in
&gt;#4.  I have good spark and seem to have good fuel, &gt;so must be an air problem
&gt;right?
