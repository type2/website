Unfortunately, I don't have any clue how to take it out, but I was just
curious, why do you want to take it out?

thanks,

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; If there is anyone out there in Bus land that has ever removed the air
&gt; cleaner support bracket without tearing it or the bus up to much.  Mine
&gt; seems to be welded at the base and spot welds on the back but no amount of
&gt; drilling or cutting seems to do much gold- the damm thing won't budge. Any
&gt; and all advice will be greatly appreciated. As always, TIA TBear
&gt; 
&gt; Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
