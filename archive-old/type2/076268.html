Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

I've used the tiny Radio Smack meter and I can't recommend it.  The 
batteries don't last long and there is nothing worse than being out in BFE 
with an electrical problem and not being able to find replacement button 
batteries nearby.  The meter itself is cheap - I bought mine on sale for 
under $15 - but the replacement batteries are expensive.  Two of them and 
they are somewhere in the $3-4 range each if I remember.

Harbor freight recently had a sale on the cheapo made-in-China digital 
meters - $3.99 each.  For that price, I bought three of them and carry one 
or two in the bus at all times.  Very handy to have around and the 
batteries seem to last forever.  They work well for 99.5% of what you need 
a meter for.

That said, I prefer analog meters for some things, but over the last 25 
years I've had nothing but trouble with the ones from Radio Shack.  They 
seem to always start sticking within a few months.

&gt;wallet sized.. you might want to check if they have them.  It uses
&gt;button cells and tests resistance and continuity (beeps).  It also does
&gt;voltage.  That's all you need it for with a bus.  Probably 30 bux like
&gt;Sean's.. or maybe even the same one..
