Subject: Re: [T2] electrical short??

Darin:
I'm guessing your problem is NOT a short, but a loose wire (an OPEN!).
It could be a short, too, but you will see a melted insulation/wire someplace.
It sounds like it is before the ignition switch.
Intermittent electrical problems are often a bear to find no matter where they
occur.
What I'd do is try to look under the dash for loose or nearly loose wires at the
fuse panel (behind it, too), ground wires at the battery, and between the
transmission and frame.
One place I had problems was the wires that hook to the starter post along with
the battery cable - alternator and main harness.Find a good flashlight and a
pillow/ head support and get comfortable up under the dash. I know that sounds
impossible, but TRY to. You need to have all your attention on what you are
looking for and not on how bad you feel upside down!
Good luck
