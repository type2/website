Subject: Re: Road Trip

If I were going from Mass to the west coast this time of year I would 
drive straight south at least as far as Georgia and then head west. The 
weather has been getting increasingly miserable over the upper half to 
2/3 of the country over the last week or so and will only get worse 
until spring (Did you see the night football game played at Denver last 
week?). More to the bus aspect of this is that this time of year, the 
probability is high that you would be driving over salted roads 
somewhere in the country via one of the northern routes.

Have a safe and enjoyable trip,
