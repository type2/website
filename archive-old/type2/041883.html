&gt;
&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;I've got a type 2 to van which needs a new panel where the petrol 
&gt;cap is.  does anybody have any info on how big a job it is to get 
&gt;hold of one of these and to fit it ???

Nicolas,

You might try Alan Schofield _at_ http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk 
for the replacement panel of which you speak.
According to the website he make all kinds of replacement
panels for Type 2s.I was astounded at what was available.

Can't necessarily vouch for his service however as when I recently
made enquiries to him regarding availability of certain panels,
he never bothered to respond.But perhaps I was an isolated case
so give him a go.At least he is in your neck of the woods...

Cheers,
