&gt; The ones with engines in them I could not touch unless I wanted
&gt; to buy the engine. One place even quoted me $2k for a 1.7l engine
&gt; of unknown functionality (I think there must be some really
&gt; good crack going around these parts.)

FWIW, the 1971-72 411 had an almost identical 1700 engine and they are
interchangeable, and probably a lot cheaper....
