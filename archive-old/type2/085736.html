Subject: Stuck sliding door

Hello folks,

My sliding side door ('72 Kombi) opens about 4 inches untill the sliding 
hinge seems to get stuck on itself. It's on the runner O.K. nothings hanging 
loose. I can't get the cover off so all i can see is from underneath - it 
seems a catch isn't being released..... anyone have any ideas?

Cheers
