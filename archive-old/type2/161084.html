Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race + the hubcap

Hi Paul,

I asked about the Hubcap on the Buskatier's mailing list and got the  
following reply... If it surfaces again on the Buskatier list I'll  
try to find out where it is and see if we can arrange a Type2 list  
member to get it back in motion once again.


Happy Trails,

 From the Buskatier mailing list:
&gt; David Cook passed it to me on Memorial Day 2005.  It lived through  
&gt; my bus wreck a few weeks after I'd taken it on.  I took it around  
&gt; to various events during that year.  I passed it to Al who lives in  
&gt; Columbia at one of our campouts during 2006.  As far as I know, he  
&gt; still has it.  I believe he's still on the bska list.  We'll have  
&gt; to see if he's passed it along.
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The Hubcap came up in discussion on the type2 list; has anyone  
&gt;&gt; here  heard of its whereabouts recently???

Hey,
While you folks are out there doing your long distance race from Key  
West to
Alaska keep your eyes open for a lone bus hubcap and a suitcase full of
paraphernalia.  Does any one know what ever became of the hubcap that  
was
supposed to &quot;tour&quot; North America?
