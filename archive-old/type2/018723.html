&gt;6. The exhaust manifolds from the heads have lost the
&gt;protective sleeve which covered them. I recently
&gt;thought I saw a thread about wrapping these with a
&gt;asbestos type material, but could not find the thread
&gt;in archives. Anybody know about this stuff ?

Michael:

I used 1&quot; wide header wrap on mine, which can be seen on my page of bus
pictures at http://mh005.infi_dot_net/~gkucsma/buspg.html

If you can't find it locally, mail-order it.  I think J.C. Whitney sells
it for about $20 for a roll that's more than enough to do the exhaust
manifolds.
