&gt; In checking the book it

&gt;wondering if I could assume mine has sodium filled exhaust valves?  I 
&gt;believe it is a '73 engine' 1700cc.  Engine code CB069042, with a reman 
&gt;by Volkswagen Canada sticker.  I was assuming the Canadians would have 
&gt;rebuilt the motor with the updated valves.

The sodium exhaust valves came on the 1800cc engines. They were 34mm instead of the usual 33mm so it's unlikely that during the rebuild they upgraded the head.

&gt;The valves all checked out 
&gt;ok, just a little loose, except for #4 which were very tight. I set all 
&gt;the valves to .006&quot; intake, .008&quot; exhaust.  If I'm wrong, let me know.

I think 0.006&quot; is right. I would watch #4 carefully (check the valves in 500 miles or less).

&gt;So if I go through the trouble or replacing wheel cylinders, I may as 
&gt;well rebuild the back brakes entirely.  In for a penny, in for a pound.

If they don't leak or don't stick I'd wait to replace them. If you have to repalce the brake lines anyway, I'd replace them with new ones (not expensive).
