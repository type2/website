Subject: Bus is running hot

I blew #4 cylinder on a 73 because the flap system had been removed by
someone along the way, but the oil cooler flap was still present, but set
partially closed and blocking air flow over the cylinders.

I also was given a blown 76 motor that blew because someone dropped a spark
plug and left it there .... blocking the air flow between #3 and #4.

&gt;&gt; I have a 74 Bus that is running very hot (275, so I'm not driving it
except for short distances).  I stuck my hand under pistons 1 and 2
(between the pistons and the sheet metal above the heater boxes) and I
could feel air circulating.  I did this on the other side (pistons 3 and
4) and did not feel any air circulating.  I then pulled the rubber
grommet up and away from around spark plug number 2 and felt air coming
through the hole.  I tried this on spark plug 4 and felt no to very very
little air.

&gt;&gt; Seems pretty obvious that air is not being blown over pistons 3 and 4
but just wanted to ask this question anyway.  Should the air circulation
be the same for both sides of the engine?  With the oil cooler on the
side of 3 and 4 I didn't know if that would block some of the air flow?
I'm going to look into the fan housing and the flaps more but thought I
would ask the group.  Thanks for any and all responses.
