&gt; This is probably a stupid question but...
&gt;
&gt; Why are people using Webers on their busses?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;        W.


Well, after figuring out that the acceleration pump thing on
stock carbs was shot I needed new carbs.
It was the first time I ever saw an engine and it was a big
project, so I went with a single carb. (I never changed oil and I
was about to completely rebuild my engine).
I told myself that it would be easier to adjust and no balancing.
That was perfect for the extensive traveling my wife and I did
while we lived in the westy.(about 20,000? in 6 months, nice
vacation) There is some adjustment necessary when you go from
Sedona Arizona to Boulder Colorado. : )
So basically it was an easy bolt on escape from bus reality.


peace,
