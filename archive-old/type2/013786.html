Regarding vermin in stored buses, Steve said:
&gt;The best way of all is don't let it sit for long 
&gt;periods of time!  No pest
&gt;control system is going to work unattended for a
year.  

This sounds reasonable, but I have had personal
experience with mice building a nest in the glove box
of a car used 5 days a week, and doing damage to the
ignition system of another car in daily use.
If I were going to use trays of antifreeze, I would
cover them with cages of 1&quot; mesh chicken wire.  That's
what we do in the hay mow of our barn, and it lets in
the !_at_** mice so they can drown in the buckets of
water and antifreeze, but the cats can't get in there.
