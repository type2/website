Subject: Gene Berg Dipstick on type4 engine?

I used to have an 80 Vanagon that I bought one of the JC Whitney senders 
that bolted to the head at #3. It had a wire that piggy backed to the oil 
pressure sender and made the oil light come on when the head got hot. Also, 
I find the Type 4 engine runs cooler than type 1.

&gt; I recently read about the Gene Berg oil temp dipstick which flashes a
dash light at 227 degrees or so.  I see he makes a version for the type
4 engine.  The archives on this mainly apply to early engines.  Has
anyone used one with a late bus?  I'm wondering if the hotter running
type 4 engine will cause it to flash too often and become a
distraction.  Also, would there be any problem in wiring it to one of
the unused dash lights (i.e. CAT or EGR)?
