Subject: Awning Suggestions

Hey all,
I've searched the archives for some info on awnings.  I found
http://www.shadyboy_dot_com/vans/
which has a different kind of awning - it appears to hang free with
cantilever fiberglass poles for support.  It is 10' x 6' and stores in a
small case hanging on the rain gutter. ~$200

I also saw the sunsail awnings
http://eurocampers_dot_com/page15.html
(8.69 x 6.88 ft.) for  $152.95* &amp; (10.49 x 6.88 ft.) for $174.95
But these appear to fold up and stow for storge.  They do not roll into
a hanging case.

I read a couple of e-mails wrt a pull out awning that was ~$500 (wheeww)

Does anyone have any recent experience?
I am interested in getting a roll out awning that would attach to the
rain gutter

Suggestions

Any awnings for sale?  Any awnings at your local bone yard??

thanks
michael
