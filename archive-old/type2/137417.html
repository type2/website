Subject: Re: [T2] Best wire size

&lt;&lt; Hi Volks- I am running a separate circuit for my accessories and need to
know the best size and type of wire to run from the back of the bus forward.
The last wire I used turned out to be REALLY cheap wire, was very stiff, and
very hard to run to the front. Can anyone suggest a more flexible type of
wire and gauge? TIA Ted
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I went to a shop that specializes in custom sound systems for cars, boats, 
planes and houses. They stocked fine-strand braided copper wire in many 
sizes and I chose to use #8 for the long runs you describe. The soft fine 
braided copper carried with it a problem of cleanly cutting and connecting 
to commercial terminals.
The very helpful shop owner loaned me a professional grade cutter and 
crimper, which was necessary. The fine nature of the cut ends are a major 
problem without such a tool. Talk to your supplier about it.

And, I ended up replacing all the new connections with marine-grade 
connectors wherever the wires were exposed to outside conditions like road 
salt and moisture. Easier to do it that way the first time.

Don't forget to consider matching the ground wires that service your 
accessories if you increase the positive wire size. For instance, if you 
are doubling the wattage of the headlights, you will want to use better 
feed and ground network, and some relays.
