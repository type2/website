This is true, so it is not appropriate coverage for a primary 
vehicle.  However, if your old VW is a second vehicle, it is a 
bargain.  I am paying $59/year for comp, collision, and liability 
on my '63 Deluxe Bus, with NO deductable, and, in Pa., no state 
inspection on historic vehicles.  For Pa. Historic Vehicle 
classification, the vehicle is not supposed to be driven at night 
except to or from car &quot;events&quot;, and for antique insurance coverage 
it must be garage kept and driven under 3000 miles a year .  In 
fact, that's about all I drive it anyway, but for what it's worth, 
nobody has ever actually asked me for an odometer reading, and so 
far I've never been pulled over driving at night.
