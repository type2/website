Subject: Engine Unseized !!!!!

Howdy. I just wanted to post a follow up, and also a thank you to all who
offered advice on the 77 automatic bus with stuck engine. I pulled the
spark plugs, and dumped about 1/2 quart of marvel mystery oil into each
cylinder, and let that soak for a couple days. After that, I didn't even
need a wrench - the starter cranked it right over. yay!!!!!! OF course,
the MMO got splashed up all over the bus, but that's a small price to pay.
With new plugs installed, it runs great, although it is still awfully smoky.
thanks.
