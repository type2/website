  accessys_at_smart_dot_net wondered about Jed's problem :

&lt;&lt; do you think you don't actually get it in 4th or is it an automatic. &gt;&gt;

My thoughts exactly.  If its a manual gearbox you'll know if you 
can't engage 4th!  And if it's an automatic it might not be shifting
out of 2nd......(?)
