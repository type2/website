&gt;Not much in the archives about using red-top optima batteries for

I have been using one in my bus for about the past year, and have had one 
in my &quot;other&quot; vehicle for many years.  They are perfectly suited to 
starting, in fact they are designed for it and do a better job than a 
flooded lead-acid ever could.  I would upgrade to a solid-state regulator 
at the same time to be sure it charges properly.

&gt;Are they worth the candle?

Depends on the person.  You can get them for about $100 from the membership 
stores.
