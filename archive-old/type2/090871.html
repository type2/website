Subject: Re: [T2] Gross Polluters

They just were not into track work and industrial electric so they bought
and mothballed the iron wheeled 
public transport industry.
--------------- Clip -----------------------
Seems that is the way of many industries.
A local large Cadillac/Lincoln/Pontiac/Lexus/Infinity ??? dealership just
bought out a competitor and simply closed him down. No fanfare, just
closed down the 50 year old dealership. 
I remember when Laidlaw and Browning Ferris industries ran the same scam
on the waste collection industry, they simply did like the big Daily
Newspapers, bought out the competition and raised the rates.
As the smaller towns in Texas grow into full blown communities with
consumer buying power I'm seeing Lowes, Home Depot simply buy out the
existing Ma and Pa lumber yards and close them down.
If the locals have loyalty to the old family owned establishments its
just wiped out in one fell swoop of the corporate financial officers ego.
Sears bought out Western Auto and closed down all of the city stores that
competed with a Sears auto Store. They left the small town stores
operating that were franchised but will soon drive them out with delayed
shipments and a variety of unethical devices that corporate America has
in their toolbox.
