Subject: Re: [T2] Interesting Bay

&gt; Am I reading something into this, or is my '77 Bay unusual?
&gt; Normal setup?

Nope, thats normal setup. There are some bench seat bays out there. I've
only seen them in the earlier models, ie 68 to maybe 71 in north america,
maybe went later in the rest of the world. They are the 9passenger models or
they can be a bench seat westy which has a sink/ref/hanging closet inline
behind the driver/passengers. Most often a euro/cdn model 'cuz the gaz
bottle is inside not to dot spec. I've got the pieces, just not the bus they
fit. (as if I needed more)
