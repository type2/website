Subject: Linnoleum and pop top Q:

Hiya -

3 questions, if anyone happens to know:

1. Due to four smallish repairable rust holes under the floor of my '70 
camper (not in main part/center - which looks good - but on each side of the 
bus/floor there are two holes, near the sliding door and then also on 
opposite side of bus), it's been suggested that I remove the floor (original 
linoleum) to inspect the whole floor more thoroughly and do any fixing.  
Does anyone know if there's a way to save the linoleum and reinstall it 
afterwards?  Is that just an insane idea?

2. The pop-top (ASI/Riviera straight-up kind) needs washing, but otherwise 
looks pretty good, with the exception of a very small tear in the yellow 
nylon/vinyl (?), and a tiny hole or two in the bug screen.  The white 
fiberglass frame (or whatever it's made of) looks to be in darn good 
condition - just dirty.  I'm concerned that if I take a power washer to it - 
which the whole thing seems to need - that water will get into the bus.  Any 
thoughts on how to safely clean this area, and on any products or other 
procedures you recommend?

3. What's best (durable and aesthetic) route to repairing the hole in the 
yellow part?

Thanks Much -
Marya
