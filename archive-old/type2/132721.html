Subject: RE: [T2] fuel line hoses

&gt; Why take such a risk when we're talking $25 in materials?
&gt; Just do it and know it is done and done right...

OK, y'all have convinced me to do this job.  I've read a few of the
instructions on the web about how to do this, and it seems reasonably
straightforward, but I'm mildly paranoid about taking on such a job
alone, fiven the castastrophic risks of doing it incorrectly.

Any Seattle-area folk experienced with this task interested in helping a
relative newbie on this job?  Or, failing to find experienced folk, any
other rebies at this task interested in getting together for a group
learning experience, so we can check eah other's work and otherwise
kibitz?
