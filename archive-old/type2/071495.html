Subject: Need a back bench???
Message-ID: &lt;dd8a6992.24badb0b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

A friend of mine has decided that he wants to get rid of his back seat in his 
78 bus. It is the fold down style that streatches all the way across the 
back. It is brown, and from what i have seen there are no real rips or 
problems with it. I dont think that he has the seatbelts to go in it.
   Anyway, i'm not sure if he wants to trade it, straight up get rid of it, 
or get some cash for it. Also, i need to talk to him about if he is willing 
to ship. We are located in Aston, Pa, which is right outside Philly.
  first taker may be the one.
