Subject: Re: [T2] VW's minivan

&gt;Exactly. VW is in a rut right now and I wish they'd put out a new van  
&gt;at another time. That chrysler body is going to tarnish the van  
&gt;concept and stick out like a sore thumb on the VW lot.
&gt;
If I wanted a new Eurovan style van I'd prob go plop down the cash If I 
had it for a turbo diesel Dodge Sprinter aka Mercedes. The tall boxy 
vans are what I'm interested in for their superior interior space. Makes 
a better camper. See the UPS delivery vans. PLENTY of interior space. 
Maybe more than I'd want.

There are dozens of tall vans like those (Euorvan, Sprinter Ducato) sold 
in Europe. There are also a bunch of people movers aka the first style 
Odyssey van. It is that van (Sharan or Caravelle) I would have expected 
to see on their lots here.

Maybe I'll be able to add a Eurovan Weekender to our stable in a couple 
more years.
