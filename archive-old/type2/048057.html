Subject: [T2] Selling the V'gon

    Hello everyone!!!

Well, I think it is time to sell the 82 Westy. I finally got the quirks
worked out of the engine, but I really miss the baywindows. So here we go:

82 Westy, white, body is in good shape, with  only a couple of dings in it.
No rust. The engine is running great, it has a A/C pump, but not hooked up
so I don't know if it works.
The interior is the way I got it, a little rough but very campable. The
refrigerator works in all modes, water pump works and the stove works.

$3000 and you get a spare motor with it!!!!!

E-mail me for more info.
