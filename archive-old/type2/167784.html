&gt;&gt;  Hmmm... How about the old &quot;saturate before using&quot; burlap bag hanging in
&gt;  &gt; front of the radiator? Anybody remember those?

	to which a response was:

&gt;I remember them, but they weren't used to cool the air going into the
&gt;radiator.  They were used to keep the contents of the bag cool.

	Yes, evaporating some of the water on the surface of the 
suitably porous canvas will cool the water; and that is the primary 
purpose.
	However, it is also true that the air flowing past the 
KoolBag. will be cooled.  The latent heat of evaporation of water is 
taken some from the bag but also some from the passing air into which 
the water evaporates.
	If that air then goes thru a radiator, all else being equal 
that motor will run cooler.
	If the air goes into a grille feeding the fresh air to the 
dash vents, that air will be cooler than it would have been without 
this no-moving-parts cooling device.  It will also be more humid  - 
but in the places where such a device works best, approximately in 
the vicinity of Nevada, that air will still be of low R.H.
	Thermocouples placed in the relevant air &amp; water may give us 
some idea of the apportionment of cooling between the water in the 
bag and the air.
	i know some clever refrigeration experts who may be kind 
enough to estimate some of the figures involved.


George later quoth:

&gt;You can still get new ones on that auction site.  The original
&gt;manufacturer still exists, but they only make them in batches of 1000.
&gt;
	Whatever the numbers, they are favourable and likely to be 
highly cost-effective.
	I suspect campers across the Tasman, e.g back o' Bourke, may 
have all this taped already.  I've certainly seen such water-bags on 
vehicles there  -  brandname Billabong I dare say.
