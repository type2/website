 &gt; bombers&quot;

Heh.  I was once driving to work over the Sunol Grade where I-680 goes from 
the Livermore valley over into the San Francisco Bay proper, and as soon as I 
passed the last off-ramp, last chance to escape before 4 miles of hills, I 
found myself in stopped traffic (which I couldn't see from the offramp...).

An hour later, I reached the cause: a jacknifed &quot;tomato bomber&quot;.  Both tubs 
had spilled tons of Roma tomatos all over all three lanes.  A skip-loader was 
scooping them up into dump trucks.  It smelled like a bad Italian Restaurant 
and was sliperry as anything.

THat was 4 years ago, and to this day you can find volunteer tomato-thickets 
along the road at that spot...
