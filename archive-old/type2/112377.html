Subject: Re: [T2] Carb replacement

Hi Rob,

Better fuel economy and power curve are confirmed. Look at the archives 
for the horror stories getting a single weber tuned properly. Some 
people eventually get the weber dialed in, but the cost can be killer.

The problem with stock carbs is they wear out, and are hard to get 
serviced.

I'm switching my bus over to FI. Horsepower, powerband and fuel economy 
will all improve. I'm currently looking into a Megasquirt conversion 
but have not completely ruled out going to a proper Bosch L-Jet setup.

Happy trails,
