Subject: Engine Stands...

A simple roll-about (V8 stlye 4-bolt) engine stand can be easily and
inexpensively
modified to not only hold your T1 or T2 motor, but also double as a test bench.

Our local NAPA supplier has 3-wheel models (T-section) stands on sale for 45.99,
and 4-wheel models (U-section) for sale for 59.95. I prefer the 4-wheel model as
it distrubutes the weight of the engine over a double supported axis, has
less tendancy
to tip to either side when rotating the block, and uses larger, heavier
duty wheels.

For T1 motors try to find a 68-73 Beetle transmission, or if you're a 72+
baywindow person,
scavenge the local junkyard for a 68-72 4-speed bus tranny and remove the
bell-housing.
An alternative transmission to consider is the automatic tranny found in
412's and/or
late model auto-trannies somewhat common in 76-80 buses.

You will need toolwise:
        3/8&quot; rachet
        7&quot; extension
        13mm 3/8&quot; socket
        17mm 3/8&quot; socket
        10mm Allen-head socket
        13 &amp; 17mm open/box end wrenches
        3qt disposable container (combo drainpan/container available at
FLAPS 4.99)
        Medium sized rubber mallet, or claw hammer and a couple of rags
        A block of some kind (spare tire?) to prop tranny up after removing
the upper tranny mount

Automatic buses don't have rear (FIF) tranny mounts, so if you find one of
these buses and
the motor has already been removed most likely you'll have to prop up the
tranny with a block
or spare tire so as to get easier access to the bellhousing bolts.

Most of these have 6 13mm bolts which hold the bell housing to the
transmission. Use
caution when working on these, and be ecological by draining the gear oil
into a disposable
container for proper disposal. You will need the 10mm Allen-head socket to
remove the bottom
drain plug...

Once the 6 13mm bolts are removed (and the starter *IF it has been left
behind) smack the bell
housing a few times around the perimeter to loosen it from the paper gasket
which resides
between both seams, and Ka-ching.... You've got a nifty, custom engine
stand mount...almost!

Clean up your mess and take your new &quot;custom engine stand part&quot; home to
clean  and install on
your shiney new rolling stand.

I pay usually 5-7.00 for the bell housing(s) at our local parts yard,
15.00-20.00 IF I leave the
starter on the bell-housing... The price range depends on the guys mood at
the junkyard and if I
feel inclined to haggle.... Usually less if I am buying other junk at the
same time....

Once back in your shop/garage/basement take your clean bell-housing (I
painted a few of ours
to match the color of the rolling stands they reside on) and place it open
end down on a table
or bench.  Place the flat side of the rolling stand mount plate (remove the
4-adjustable block
arms that are probably dangling from the front side of the plate) on top of
the bell housing &amp;
with a black magik-marker make drill guide marks where you will need to
drill mounting holes.

Check the alignment between where the output shaft hole is on the bell
housing, and the rotating
tube which clamps the engine stand mount plate to the rolling chassis.  You
should be able to
look down through the hole and see the output shaft hole fairly centered...
This is not super-duper
critical, but the closer you can get it, the better the balance of the
engine stand.  Properly done
and you should be able to single-handedly rotate your favorite longblock
with ease 360 degrees.

Get out your trusty drill and grab a 1/2&quot; drill bit, drill the four holes
you marked with your felt-tip
pen on the backside of the bellhousing, bolt the rotating engine plate to
the bellhousing  using 4
10x35 bolts w/lock washers and nuts facing away from the engine (flywheel
clearance) and you're
almost done.

Mounting the engine test stand components I leave up to you. We have a
variety of stands and
each is a little different, but the basics are as follows:

Starter:
The starter gets mounted in the obvious place, run a ground strap from the
bottom bolt to
        the - (negative) battery terminal of your &quot;test&quot; battery.
Fuel/Pump:
We keep a low pressure fuel pump mounted to the downleg of the engine stand
(stewart-warner)
        in the event the engine we're testing happens to have a faulty
mechanical pump. This is a
        simple 12volt pump producing 3-6psi and costs new at the local
FLAPS approx 32.00.
We also use a one gallon plastic gas-can with the outgoing fuel line
running from the fillertube
        of the can though a fuel filter to the inlet side of the pump, and
a small piece of hose running
        from the vent tube on the can to an area above and away from the
exhaust.
Ignition:
As an ignition you can rig up a myriad of options, the cheapest and most
effective for us is a
        remote starter switch, made by Craftsman and available for under 20.00.
I usually mount the ignition coil to the bell housing somewhere near the
top so as to keep  a
        short coil to distrubutor wire.
Gauges:
        Again, they mount anywhere you want, and the variety is up to you.
We run basic gauges on
        two stands (Oil Pressure,Oil Temp, Cylinder Head Temp, &amp; Ammeter)
and have a stand we
        set up for F.I. stuff which has an Ox sensor, Manifold pressure,
and Resistance probe in a
        2nd set of gauge plates mounted to the side of the stand.
Options:
        The skys's the limit, I've got a buddy who mounted an airhorn on
his stand, and when I asked
        why, he said &quot;So's I can get someone's attention instead of yelling
over the noise of the motor!&quot;
        Sounded logical, but I was afraid to ask what the side view mirror
was for......
