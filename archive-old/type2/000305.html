Since it is Fri and there seems to be a rash of FFARTS going around, I think
the following is appropriate.

	I fully realize that I have not succeeded in answering all of your
questions ..... Indeed, I feel I have not answered any of them completely.
The answers I have found only serve to raise a whole new set of questions,
which only lead to more problems, some of which we weren't even aware were
problems..

	To sum it all up... In some ways I feel were are confused as ever, but I
believe we are confused on a higher level, and about more important
things.(Author Unknown)

Hope this clears things up and have a happy Memorial day holiday. :) TBear





Don't take life too seriously, you'll never live through it.
