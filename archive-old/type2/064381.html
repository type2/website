Subject: Re: SIR impressions

&gt;
&gt;I just recieved an order I placed with SIR for a 40 horse I'm building, 
&gt;and my initial impressions, without having miked everthing yet, are quite 
&gt;good. After having marginal luck w/GEX and rotten luck w/MOFOCO this is a
&gt;welcome relief.
&gt;Suprisingly, they sent Kolbenschmidt main bearings and German gaskets.
&gt;On the down side, they sent the wrong DIRTY oil cooler.  As the other 
&gt;parts appear to be first rate, they get the benefit of the doubt.  I 
&gt;expect that they will be as horified about the dirt in there as I am and 
&gt;replace it promptly.  
&gt;
&gt;On Thursday I'll be able to check everything properly and will report back
&gt;if anything is out of specs.
&gt;

Roughly a year ago there was an article in either Hot VW or VW Trends (I 
forget which) on the dropped-seat problem with Type 4 heads.  Mostly this 
article was an interview with Mark Stephens.  In the article, it listed two 
brands of heads that had the most frequent problems with dropped seats.  (I 
was very surprised to see them &quot;badmouth&quot; any product by name!) One of 
these, I'm almost positive, was SIR.
Haven't had any experience with SIR.  Just recalled that article when I saw 
the name mentioned and thought I'd mention it.
