Subject: Re: [T2] CR on DP to SP conversion

Jake, Doc, list:
Doc Ric really had 2 questions here, compression ratio being the main one.
What is really important is that the c/r not be set too high. Opinion varies and
expected gasoline quality would determine this (though recent drive reports from
Mexico indicate this is less of a problem than it used to be).
The maximum c/r would be somewhere in the 7.5/1 area and if you are close,
better make sure you are accurate. Many would prefer a number more like 6.9-7.0.

I  am of the belief that higher compression is free power, but of course it
comes at the slight cost of shorter engine life.
A few minutes spent with your machinist and you can either have him cc your
heads or explain how.
Second  was your statement about balancing. You really need to balance the rods
end for end (IOW even out all the big end weights and all the small end weights
and then recheck the big ends). Many years ago I worked in a high performance
machine shop and balanced many rods. They use a special rig with rollers and a
counter balance, but I'm sure you could rig up something with knife blades and a
gram (dealers') scale.
Balancing the reciprocating parts (pistons and rods)  only will give you the
best return on investment, if you are on a tight budget. I'd guess a shop would
do it for about $50 or so.
Higher quality pistons like Mahles and NPR's were almost always perfect from the
factory.

&gt; &gt; I argue with the doc as much as anyone, but I had this done to my 2liter
&gt; &gt; when it was rebuilt and I can vouch for his observation,  however it is a
&gt; &gt; diminishing returns sort of thing, the closer the balance the more it
&gt; &gt; costs, I think VW allowed 9 grams out before a rebuild and 4-5 grams at
&gt; &gt; rebuild...I found that a good compromise from perfectly on$$$$ and way off
&gt; &gt; was at 1gram, so I had my pieces and entire assembly balanced at
&gt; &gt; 1gram..(didn't do the flywheel because I don't have one (auto
&gt; &gt; tranny) added about $100 to the cost of the job

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I am set to go on building the new engine.  I should get the case back
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Friday, and upon inspection the machinist said it looked to be in very
&gt; good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;condition.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Anyway, with NEW jugs and heads, do I have to measure the CR? Seems
&gt; like an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;extra job that I could do without right now. (Novice here)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What, you mean you will tear it down and do it later??? Should always be
&gt; &gt; &gt; verified. Deck heights should be matched. Combustion chambers should be
&gt; &gt; &gt; matched for volume. Good money spent to have your machinist do this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a gram scale to check the rods. Should I check the new pistons
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;well?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most certainly. Also, the rods should be balanced end to end and total
&gt; &gt; &gt; weight. I would also spent the money for the machinist to do this. Also,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the crank and flywheel should be independantly balanced, then bolted
&gt; &gt; &gt; together and finish balanced as a unit. If all this is done right, that
&gt; &gt; &gt; motor will idle and run so smooth it will put a smile on your face every
&gt; &gt; &gt; time you fire it up for the next 100k, assuming maintenance by
&gt; inspection.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And balance as well the valve springs, meaning their pressures at both
&gt; &gt; &gt; installed height and at lift height.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Balance = harmony = efficientcy = longevity = best cost per mile,
&gt; &gt; &gt; regardless the cost, which is value. Leave all this out and what you
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; &gt; is GEX. It will cost only some 10% more in time/money to have a balanced
&gt; &gt; &gt; assembly. This is pays off bigtime in results.
