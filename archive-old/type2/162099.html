Subject: Did you see me today?

I guess I didn't get to the mechanic in time.  My green and yellow  
bus is on the shoulder of Rt 50 (Westbound) at exit 24B just outside  
of Annapolis, MD where it spent the day.  I believe the engine has  
seized.  Well, I wanted to do a rebuild and didn't know if I should  
build up the '71DP or the original '68SP.  I guess the decision was  
made for me today (the '71DP was in the bus) :-)

Did I mention my new distributer came yesterday, and exhaust today?   
The wife is taking this all extremely well.
