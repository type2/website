Subject: Rings and related work - how much$$$?

Not having a garage or the time to lay on our La Nina rain soaked
streets to make repairs I was wondering what the following might cost me
via a mechanic based on the lists previous personal experience - ball
park, i.e. &quot;I spent ????$$$$ dollars to have rings (and what ever)
replaced, yada(tune-up), yada(misc) - here's the scoop:

'75 2.0L FI w/126k miles
- #2 cylinder ring stuck or broken(guess)
- #2 cylinder is the lowest of all 4 in compression test
- #2 spark plug fouled (baked with oil - the other 3 are clean and show
normal wear - I can chip it off/soak it clean/ or put in a new one and
get back 10 to 15 mph climbing hills and general acceleration - re-fouls
quickly
- high oil consumption - smokes occasionally-  may be in combination
with a cracked oil filler tube leaking onto the heat exchanger, looking into
that

I've been reading Tom Wilson's How to Rebuild your VW book - all of the
&quot;whys&quot; have been answered there.  After reading why predetonation
happens or what parts will allow oil to blow by due to being worn or
broken has been very enlightening.  Most of the idle/tune-up issues that
come across this list are discussed in the diagnosis section and the
tear down/rebuild sections.  I just wish I had the place and time to
make repairs myself.

I know MMMV - just looking for a ballpark number to be aware of when I
$tart talking to mechanic$.  It may be high enough to push me to find a
friends garage to work in for a while.
