Pushrod tube seals if you are lucky. Pretty easy fix.


&gt;~Thermostat
&gt;http://nomad.freezope_dot_org/photos/Bus/busthermo.jpg
&gt;No cable in sight, very grimey and hard to clean.
&gt;(Thanks for the article, German Supply. If my picture is helpful,
&gt;please take it and use it..even if it is as a &quot;before&quot; picture :-})

Bad Idea to drive without the Thermostat connected, if the flaps are in 
place. Look at the top of the engine at the back of the fan shroud. If there 
is a bar that runs across the fan housing, flaps are likely in place and you 
need to replace the cable. It goes up through the tin to the top and 
connects to the bar I just mentioned.

This a good link for an exploded veiw.

To replace the thermostat check out this link

or go to

and check the Tech articles for thermostat.




&gt;~Fuel pump
&gt;Mechanical fuel pump with a nipple pointing down at an angle without a
&gt;line attached.  Fuel line from tank to pump, pump to carb is new. Big
&gt;lines coming from the back of the carb out sides is much tougher than
&gt;the new fuel line and no cracks in sight. Funky quarter sized
&gt;connector when viewed from behind rear tires. No fuel filter.

The replacement line is probably a stock match. The carb line is after 
market like the carb. You need a fuel filter inline pre pump, post pump 
would be additional coverage, but not ness.



&gt;~Carb
&gt;There's a nipple right under the filter (facing back, above left-not
&gt;the fuel line) which has no tube or plug.
&gt;There a tube coming from right below the carberator facing the rear of
&gt;the engine which is blocked with a golfing tee.
&gt;Carb is Holley with codes &quot;L6503 2870&quot; on aluminum plate near filter.
&gt;Let me know if posting a picture would be helpful

This should be for Crank Case Ventilation (CCV) no valve just a line to the 
oil breather. The other one sounds like a vacuum line.

I reguards to Holley you should check those numbers again and see if you can 
find some more to help isolate the actual model. L6503 I can't find but 
Model 2870 is listed with a Kit # 3-358. For tech info look here.

&gt;~Emergency Brake
&gt;Are the two cables above rear tires with accordian grommits emergency
&gt;brake cables? Mine aren't connected to anything.

Do you have cables to the heat control valves on the heater boxes?

&gt;~Oil Pressure Switch
&gt;Oil pressure light failed On position check. Passed when wire was
&gt;grounded. Cleaned and tightened wire and connection, still no light.
&gt;Next step is to replace oil pressure switch?

No light good, brite light bad.


&gt;~Aesthetics
&gt;Looks damn cool with rear raised and front lowered.  Source for
&gt;swampers and hydralics?
&gt;JUST KIDDING.

Don't get crasy.

&gt;Would you drive 10 miles to camp this weekend?

I can't I am getting ready to move =D.
