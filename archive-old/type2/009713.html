&gt; &gt; Yes, I remember the discussion last year.  In that discussion, I
wrote
&gt; &gt; about the experiment that I did by attaching a pointer to one of the
&gt; &gt; flap pivots so that I could visually check the position of the flap.
&gt; &gt; I discovered that at low outside air temperatures the flaps do
indeed
&gt; &gt; modulate the flow of air.  On a freezing day, I stopped after
running
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'd agree that in really cold weather, the flaps might not always be
&gt; fully open. But I see absolutely no difference in head temp from the
hottest
&gt; day to the coldest day, once the engine is warmed up, with flaps in
place
&gt; but no thermostat.

I find this result surprising!  Do I understand that you saw the same
head temperature regardless of outside air temperature with the flaps
disabled?  Strange!

 What I do see is a major difference in oil temps, winter
&gt; and summer, but since (on the T4 engine anyway) when the flaps are
closed,
&gt; more air goes to the oil cooler, I'd think that'd be the opposite of
what
&gt; you want to get the oil temp up high enough to burn off water.

The oil cooler bypass valve is supposed to act as a thermostat,
bypassing the cooler when the oil is too thick to flow well through
the cooler passages.  It doesn't seem to be all that good at
maintaining oil temperature.  I wonder if the finned case bottom is
cooling the oil further even when most of the oil is bypassing the
cooler.  You might try putting a batt of insulation over the fins to
see if this would raise the oil temps to a higher amount.
