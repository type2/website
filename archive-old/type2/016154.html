I found an adapter at an RV supply store.  It came with a 4 ft rubber hose
and works great for the small bottles.

A while back I remember somebody saying they converted their stove to run 
off those Coleman propane cylinders. My tank so rusted I can't get it filled

anymore. The Coleman cylinders seem like a good idea for the amount I use 
the stove.

Problem is I can't find a regulator/adapter for the coleman cylinder. Anyone

know where I can get one? I've tried the local propane supply guys, no luck.
