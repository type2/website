Losing front left wheel cylinder on &quot;old&quot; Alaska Highway, nowhere, any
direction!  Pulled wheel, and brake cylinder 0n Dtasun 510, and found a screww
in the interior upholstery works that was about same size as brake line
opening, stuck screw into line and reassembled, good hard pedal on other three
wheels, used this later in life to leave front right wheel &quot;loose&quot; in Foreign
&quot;B&quot; stocks for racing on clay tack, so that wheel would always steer, and tech
would never find out!

B. losing vacuum wipers on '46 Mercury Coupe, and removing girlfriend's and my
shoelaces, tied them together, then one end of string in through driver's
window and other end in through passenger window,pulled back and forth to next
place, 40 miles!
