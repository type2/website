Subject: Re: [T2] RE: List Mailings

Better suggestion: encourage it to send the mail to a NEW mailbox or folder called Type2... 

I have my own archive with 15K+ messages. Easier than searching for stuff in the archives sometimes. Technically Eudora sends copies of all Type2 mail to my &quot;archive&quot; folder which I never edit AND to my &quot;Newmail Type2&quot; mailbox which I dump daily to keep the new mail separated from old mail. Scan the subjects, answer a few, and dump the rest. You folks can get off topic all you want with me - delete is fast... &lt;grin!&gt;

I sort ALL of my mail into mailboxes and archive 3 lists I subscribe to. I also archive cerrtain people's posts too because their info is generally so entertaining or informative. 

My FILTERS are a 150+ step process. I just add a new one when I need to. 

Also I recommend &quot;Mailwasher&quot; to screen out the SPAM. P-mail if you want help with that. If you are going to use it, holler, I have a huge filter list in that and I can share that with you. 

Chris
