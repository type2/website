&gt;The speedometer and fuel gauge illumination in my '70 buses was terrible.

&gt;keep Wagner P/N 17037 handy 'cuz it made my dash light up one heck of a 
&gt;lot better than the original bulbs of 30 year vintage.

All filament bulbs lose brightness with age. I have had so many problems 
with Wagner stuff right out of the box that I will never use them. New 
bulbs of any brand will be brighter than any similar bulb with age. Note 
how long the originals lasted. You won't get near that life with any bulb 
designed to be cheap, like the Wagners. I have found SOME of the CarQuest 
bulbs are made in Cheklasovoklia (sp) and appear to be the same high spec 
as German bulbs, with bright hard chrome bases, thick glass and nicely 
supported filaments.
