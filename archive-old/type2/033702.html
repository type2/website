Sounds like your clutch cable has stretched.  This same thing just happened
to me last week.  What really happened was that strands of the clutch cable
started breaking, which allowed the remaining strands to unravel and
provide slack in the clutch cable.

The solution is to replace the cable.  Not a particularly pleasant job, but
can be done in an hour or so.  I found a new cable locally for US$6 - any
decent VW FLAPS should have it.  Buy grease also to lubricate the new cable
as you install it.

Also check the bracket that holds the cable housing to the transaxle.  The
mount for this bracket (two 8mm studs into magnesium) is somewhat
under-engineered for the task in my opinion - I have seen an excessive
number of stripped studs and broken bosses on the transaxles I have come
into contact with.  Hopefully this will not be your problem.
