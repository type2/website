Subject: Re: [T2] '76 FI died -

Hi Barry,

Sounds like a fuel delivery problem. My Dad's FI'd Vanagon westy did 
this last week on him, and the problem went away on its own as soon as 
the temps came up from -20C to -5C. We figure it was a blocked fuel 
filter, clogged with ice or frozen impurities.

Do you have a fuel pressure gauge? This will help determine if there is 
enough fuel getting through.

Suggestion: Swap in a fresh filter and see what that does for you. Let 
us know.

Happy Boxing Day,

Greg Potts

&gt; 4) The '76 started this morning (08:30) IMMEDIATELY with just the turn 
&gt; of the key.  I left it to idle/warm up for 5 minutes while I did some 
&gt; running around stuff.
&gt;
&gt; 5)  The '76 left the outside parking space as normal, with a little 
&gt; hesitation the first half block.  About 1/2 mile through the 
&gt; neighborhood, the '76 started to STALL when in 3rd &amp; 4th gear.  I put 
&gt; the clutch in, and when I tried to catch the engine while still going 
&gt; about 20 mph, the '76 would catch and then stall.  This happened about 
&gt; 3 times, and the '76 getting down in speed.  I pulled over (coasted 
&gt; over) into a parking space.  This is about 1 mile from the start.
&gt;
&gt; 6) Now it becomes interesting.  I was stuck 1 road mile from home, and 
&gt; *** the '76 engine would start and run for 5 seconds.  I could NOT 
&gt; keep the engine running.  After about 3 times like this, the engine 
&gt; would not trun over AT ALL!!
