Subject: Re: [T2] steering wheels

Hiya Collie,

Well, I don't have a spare steering wheel, but I do have an idea for you.  
Why not repair/renew the steering wheel yourself?  Pay a visit to John 
Henry's BugShop website.  He has just finished a step-by-step steering wheel 
restoration guide.  With pictures yet!  He used POR Putty for this task.  And 
while I have not yet done a steering wheel, I have used the putty and this 
stuff is terrific.  I'm going to go this route with my steering wheel a 
little later this year.

And, insofar as the hard plastic steering wheels go, I'm not absolutely sure, 
but I believe they were around from 68 to 72 as standard issue.  I know my 70 
is so equipped.  The rubbery jobs were &quot;deluxe&quot; items starting in 73, but the 
hard plastic was still around then too.  I think.  Anybody care to chime in 
with &quot;just the facts, ma'am&quot;?
