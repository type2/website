Subject: RE: [VB] BBB VII/ kids score

WAY TO GO GUYS!  Definitely a high mark for the rest of the clubs to reach
for in their charitable endeavours!  BBB7 was a blast and I have heard from
several of us midwest BSKA's that BBB is on our annual event list.

Subject: [VB] BBB VII/ kids score


   Well this is to let everyone know that BBB was a great success, not only
for all the people that came and had a good time, but for the 2 kids
organizations that we help.
   After all is said and done we are able to donate $6000.00 dollars (up
from $3000.00 last year) to Arizona Childrens Foundation and $1000.00
dollars to Child Enrichment Fund (a local non profit charity for kids).
   This brings this years total donations to $7000.00
dollars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   This could not have been done without the help of all the different
vendors and people that donated either product and/or their time to the
event.
  There is a lot more I would like to say but a THANKS from the London
Bridge Bullis to all that attended and helped who without this event
couldn't have happened.

ronnie and the group Lou-n-Liz, John, Jim-n-Patricia, Matt, Cory, Tommy, my
nephew Kyle, my X employee Kenny (now in the Marines), my wife Traci (who
put up with me the last few weeks before the event, I was frazzeled).
