Subject: tin screws and westy vs campmobile

How the heck do you get those tin screws off?  All came off no problem
except for about four which I have yet to budge.  I'm squirting liquid
wrench like holy water but nothing.  What's the best method; an impact
screwdriver or are there any hints which can unbind them.  My second
question is what is the difference between a westy and a campmobile, a week
or so ago someone asked the same question but I have yet to see any answers
posted. Thanks in advance
