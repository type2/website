&gt;While we're beating this repair manual/procedure thing to death, does
&gt;anybody have a color wiring diagram for the '73 Bus? Is there a more
&gt;&quot;conventional&quot; wiring diagram out there somewhere? (probably not) By
&gt;conventional, I mean more like the schematics for the older cars, which
&gt;were color in the old factory manual and a couple German repair manuals
&gt;I've got.
&gt;
&gt;I'm good with schematics/wiring diagrams, having done a lot of TV &amp;
&gt;radio repair as a kid, but I've always had trouble with the newer Bus
&gt;wiring diagrams. Once they couldn't fit it on one page, it got _really_
&gt;bizarre! (IMHO)
