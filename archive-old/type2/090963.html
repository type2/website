Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 2.0 oil drain plug

12mm is the original, 14mm is a first oversize used by rebuilders, Napa
sells 15mm as a third oversize and you can just keep going from there
with a 16mm.
I stopped changing my oil through the drain and have just used the oil
screen cover plate as a drain devise.
20 year old drain plugs tend to strip out easily.
