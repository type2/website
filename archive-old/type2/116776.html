Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable replacement problem

Hey-

I went through the same thing today. I managed to get the whole thing out
(mangled), but also managed to kink my new cable trying to feed it through
the conduit. I pulled out the new cable, but was not able to satisfactorily
straighten it. I also have not been able to clear whatever the block is in
the conduit. Tomorrow morning I am headed back to the FLAPS for a new cable.

As my conduit is not cooperating, I am thinking of running my new cable
outside the conduit. My plan is to cable tie the cable to the outside of the
conduit, and to fabricate a grease-filled boot on the engine side to act as
a weather protector. It should work as before as the head will still be held
in the clamp under the dash.

Has anyone done this? Any thoughts?

Cheers,
Matthew

71 bus. As I try to pull the old cable out from the front..... the core wire
 is coming out, the 'spiral wrapping' wire is stretching and coming out, but
 most of the plastic outer sheathing seems to be staying inside the tube. At
 this rate I fear that I'll get all the wire out and leave most of the
 plastic sheathing inside the tube and be unable to get the new cable in.
Any
 thoughts or suggestions greatly appreciated.
 TIA
 Best wishes
