&gt;&gt;  Can anyone name a modern piece of machinery that has been around longer, 
&gt;&gt;  basically unchanged, than the Beetle?

I have and use weekly a Singer sewing machine, the pedal type.

I think this qualifies within the spirit of 'machinery' and 'around longer 
than the Beetle'


But how long has the Beetle been around??  Since after WWII; before WWII?? -

Is the new VW vehicle considered a Beetle??

Do we ignore that Beetles were discontinued in the USA with the '79 model, 
and consider world wide production?? - Probably...

Are we concerned about production, or would a Ford Model 'T' qualify?  They 
are still around.

BTW, it IS friday, but this has no bus content, so I vote to kick this 
thread off the list.
