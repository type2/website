Subject: RichWeber/600v .047uF

List,
The 2bbl Weber runs rich.  Now begins my trial by fire, i think.  Steve
Lashley - remember that swap at BBTA - 99?  I traded you the rear upper
storage cab? Same carb - same guts.
If i remember, you said you and a mechanic tweaked this thing before you =
went
to duals.  Any chance of remembering what main jets are in it?
Does anyone know what the stock jets are on a weber prog (DFEV)? Is there=
 such
a thing? Online resource i've missed?

Also, unrelated - i need a capacitor - 600v (or 630) .047 microfarad for =
tube
amp. I know we have a few electronics guys on the list...no one local has=
 one
and i can't meet the minimums online. Pmail if you have any info.

Thanks very much,

Clark Gordon
Morehead, ky.
