Let's do the math... US$580.60 for one fan.  That sounds about right based
on my pricing experiences with Mexican VW dealerships.

When I was seeking a locking engine compartment latch, that same dealership
in Nuevo Laredo quoted me US$200+ then the VW dealerships in Monterrey and
in Matehuala about the same.  The US price for a non-locking latch was
about $15.  Another visit to Mexico I was quoted about US$800 to order a
Type IV fuel pump.

My experience has been that if they have the part on the shelf you can
expect to pay a price more or less equal to the US price for the same part,
however; if the dealership has to special order a part they quote a price
at least 1000%-2000% more.  i.e.  I was once quoted less than $1 for a pair
of valve cover gaskets (in stock) but when it turned out they fit the
Beetle engine and not my pancake engine, the dealership said they would
have to special order for US$60.00!

Us gringos do not seem to stand a chance.
