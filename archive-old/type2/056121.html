Subject: Leaking oil???

Hi volks,

Well I have a 73 Kombi with a 1776 That just puked its carbureator.  I was
out of town so its been sitting in a shop 100 miles away for two weeks.  He
said he couldn't rebuild it (it was a Holley 2 barrel) so replaced it with
some kind of weber.  WEll my parents picked it up for me yesterday and said
it is now leaking oil from the center of the pulley.  If I'm guessing
correctly would that be the rear seal leaking?  If so does the engine have
to be pulled to replace?  I thought I remembered someone figuring out how
to do it without dropping the engine but can't find it in the archives.
Please help if you have any ideas.

Peace

Snoopy

73 kombi( that I haven't seen in three weeks) I miss her.
