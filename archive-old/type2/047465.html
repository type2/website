&gt; How big a deal is it to flip the ring and rig up motor mounts?  

Flipping the ring gear to reverse the _output_ direction is fine, but
flipping it to reverse the _input_ direction is not.  It will drive the
gears in reverse, which puts the wrong tooth surfaces in contact.  This
will lead to _Very_ short transmission life.

IIRC, this was a problem with Corvair conversions, until kits
came out to reverse the rotation of the engines.
