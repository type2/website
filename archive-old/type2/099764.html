While the AGM battery can probably handle it, your alternator only puts out 55 amps maximum, and a good deal of that is used up by other things.  Couple that with the fact that it's a bad idea to run your alternator at capacity for very long (will likely shorten it's life) and I think there is a good case for leaving your wiring as is.
