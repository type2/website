Subject: Value of cots?    Mosquito screens

I have been stashing childs cots for 10 years+ now, got a ton of them.  I
am not up on the current value.  Please give me a clue.  I don't know
wether they are $25 or $75, or $10,000 ea.  Also got a pile of mosquito
screens, how much are they worth???

New Product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 (old product I made for myself years ago, a few people saw them and said I
should go into business!)

I have magnetic screens for the front door windows and a giant mosquito
screen for the open cargo door. The latter has snaps and magnets for easy
exit.    How is thecool factor on these?  Would they be worth making 20 of
them?

I never found the rear screen was enough ventilation.

I like to sew, I could be encouraged to do some if there were interest.
