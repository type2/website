Hello everyone I have a 002 tranny for sale. I dont beleive it has ever been 
installed in a bus before. It was just put on a engine stand so engines could 
be tested only ran a few times. The main reason it was put on the stand is 
because if the guy had a break down, and he needed a new tranny or engine he 
could just bolt them up right on the side of the road.  The tranny # is 
002301103. Who ever has the best offer on this tranny will also get a new 
clutch kit I have and the axles for the tranny.  Seems like a great deal to 
me. If anyone is interested in it let me know and I will give you any info 
you need on it.  Thanks 

Dan
