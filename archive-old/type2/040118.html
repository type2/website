Subject: oil filter wrenches

The local VW mechanic did the last oil change! This is my first on the
bus. I'll be doing them all from now on. Sheesh.

I particularly liked Mike Benthin's medieval torture device for removing
a stuck filter; next would be the belt trick (now THAT'S VW! -- like
baling wire and pantyhose), but actually, after looking around, I
decided to spend the bucks and get that three-legged oil change wrench
that I was told about (found out Eastwood has 'em, and a universal cap
wrench). Expensive, but I'll never have to hassle with it again. And
that's worth all the money. What's $20 when it comes to my sanity?

(Next I just have to get a decent multimeter, eh, guys? :-) One that
measures milliamps. I'm beginning to understand that concept. Finally. A
little.)

The strap wrenches won't fit in there unless you remove that lower tin
(which is what I had to do). The cap wrenches that you find at FLAPS all
have 15 flutes, which Mahle filters (at least, don't know about Mann)
don't have. I *did* find a cap wrench at NAPA that had 36 flutes and
looked like it would fit the Mahle, but I opted for the fancy universal
wrench in case I have to go with Fram in a pinch (like today), because I
noticed the Fram, for the VW at least, doesn't have ANY flutes, just a
texture-coated surface on the rounded, closed end.

BTW, there's some fascinating stuff in The Library about oil and oil
filters. And now we've got some fascinating stuff in the archives about
oil filter wrenches!

&gt; Just a thought.. did you put oil on the mating surface
&gt; before you put the filter on?... I have never had the
&gt; problem you so colorfully described.;-) But I think I would
&gt; have enjoyed watching your &quot;quality time&quot; with your bus.
