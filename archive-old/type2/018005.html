Message-ID: &lt;373B93FE.BAD8B51_at_netzero_dot_com&gt;

&gt;         I am a little confused about how I removed the engine.  I planned
&gt; to use Sean Bartnik's method and was all done with the procedure but the
&gt; engine/tranny combo wouldn't fall at all.  Now I did only find two
&gt; mounting bolts on the front of the tranny to remove (Bartnik mentions 4)
&gt; and I could not find any clutch slave cylinder mounted on the left side of
&gt; the tranny to remove.  As the engine wouldn't come I just  bolted the
&gt; tranny back in, chained a bar under it and pulled just the engine.  So
&gt; much for my original plans of leaving them together.
&gt; Question?

Sorry, my procedure is for a Vanagon, not a Bus.  The Bus and Vanagon
use very different engine and transmission mounting methods.

The transmission on a Bus has a front mount but there are also two bolts
above where the tranny meets the engine that hold the tranny to the
frame.  These must come out in a Bus for the tranny to come out.  The
Vanagon does not have these bolts.  The Vanagon has a hydraulic clutch
(hence the slave cylinder) while the Bus has a cable-operated clutch (no
slave cylinder).  The Bus also has a different shift rod attachment
arrangement than the Vanagon, which has a side shifter attachment to the
tranny.

Other than that, they are fairly similar.  If you were just dropping the
engine and comparing between a Bus and a Vanagon you'd find them quite
similar but if you include the tranny it gets different fast.

I thought I had a procedure for pulling engine/tranny from a Bus on the
site as well as one for a Vanagon.  I may have to double check that.

&gt;         Should I drop the tranny--since everything bolted onto it
&gt; is already removed--bolt the two together and reinstall that way?  I am
&gt; leaning towards this because it sounds impossible the other way.  I pulled
&gt; it by myself today but I could probably arrange to have someone help me
&gt; get it back in.
&gt; Its a '79 2.0 liter.
&gt; 
Congrats on pulling it yourself, for me it is a 2-person job minimum!
As for pulling the tranny and then putting the engine and tranny back in
as one unit, most folks think that installing the engine + tranny is
easier than installing the engine alone.  But of course some weight is
added to the total package.  I'm not sure yet which method I prefer.

Good luck
