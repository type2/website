 ???  That's the first I've ever heard about that.  I can't find any mention
 of it in my books either.  Were the holes in the heads where the tubes go
 smaller?  Just curious for more info on this.

HMMM.. possibly why i have a small amount of p-tube seepage i have yet to 
find an acceptable cure.  i also would appreciate some info on this
