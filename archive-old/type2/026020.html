You guy's can give me all the ribbing you want, but many times my bus
camping friends have had to borrow something because they forgot theirs.  Of
course maybe they just didn't bring it on purpose because they knew I would
have it!!

I have had many compliments about my camping list, if you camp for extended
periods, you will need most of this stuff on the list.  A number of people
have printed off this list and use it everytime they load up.

I don't pull two trailers, but I do have a little scamp trailer that is a
great addition to the westy, the bus and the scamp make a great camping
combo.  I can now sleep up to 9 people without the need of a tent and have a
great place to cook and eat with plenty of room.  In the scamp is a really
nice standup propane fridge that really works.  And the scamp even has air
conditioning!!  

The '76 2.0 westy has plenty of power to pull the scamp, but to get my RPM's
down to where many of the slower busses cruise at, I am installing a '73
tranny with lower gears, which will give me even more pulling power.

Going down the road, the westy has plenty of room for the passengers because
the luggage and extra camping stuff is in the scamp.  I also don't have to
break down camp when I want to cruise during the day and I don't loose my
camp spot either!

Hey, don't knock it tell you try it!!!
