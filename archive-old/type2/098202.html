evening everyone. So one of our buspilots is making it across the
country from NC to CA. He is now just about in Denver, CO. His engine
temps have gone from ~200 to ~220 &amp; his vacuum has dropped. Can anyone
comment on whether this would be due to the increased elevation? Also
any tips I can pass along to him for helping to get his family &amp; bus
acoss the rockys would be quite nice.

My van didn't start running noticeably more sluggish until I was on the west 
side of Denver. I have the 2L, though, and it had always made decent power.

Absolute vacum will go down; I don't know what kind of guage they have, but 
there is simply less air. This can also mean decreased cooling. Some gauges may 
reflect this, others might not.

If they are taking I-70, I would be very mindful of the condition of the 
braking system. It's also very easy to foul spark plugs above say 6000 or 7000 
feet, depending on the particulars of the engine.

If it's cold outside, and it was certainly cool in Steamboat last week, the 
fouling problem will only be exacerbated, especially if the bus has a choke, or 
cold start valve. (my cold start valve didnt/doesnt work)

There are many ways around fouling problems, but if it happens, the easy way 
might be to just change the plugs.

The first time I'd driven though Denver I thought I blew up my engine. the 
power was that far off. Of course, later, I think I did overheat it and drop a 
valve seat.  A person needs to take it easy, uphill and downhill.
