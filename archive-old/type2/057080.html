After reading several posts concerning commutes in busses I guess I'll throw
 my 2¢ in....

I drive my '77 nuensitzer approximately 25-30 miles daily in my commute to
 work.  Then my wife drives it another 10-15 miles. (We work opposite
 shifts....)  So our daily driver (which is not by any means &quot;restored&quot; yet) on
 average 40-50 miles daily just to go to work and back, That's not counting
 grocery store/fast food (Taco Bell..... where else?) runs.

Hopefully (fingers crossed) we'll get the '79 going soon and that will cut the
 commute on the '77 (then we can devote more time to working on it).

As for the work done on the '77..... no engine rebuild (yet... planned after
 the '79) put in a clutch, replaced rear wheel bearings, new starter, needs an
 exhaust system... basic maintenance stuff..... It could use some R&amp;R, but it
 makes the trips OK.... (The R&amp;R will come and we tell her that daily.... You
 gotta talk nice to 'em).

If it runs and you don't live in a desert (i.e. no humans for miles in any
 direction) then i'd say.... DRIVE LIKE THE WIND!

As was posted earlier... even if you have problems occasionally (which we all
 do) at least your in/with the BUS!  What a great way to spend time....
