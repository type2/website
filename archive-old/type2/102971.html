Subject: &quot;Smog&quot; stickers, Vacuum Stickers

List,

Does anyone have pictures of the vacuum diagram stickers and smog stickers
on the engine bay door?

I have both stickers still on my '79 bus , but much of the info is not
readable any more. If I could get good clear photos of these stickers I
could reproduce them, which would be beneficial. I would redraw the artwork
and have them printed, and it would not be expensive through a connection I
have.

Anyone who has surviving clear smog or vacuum stickers, please p-mail them
to me and I will get started on this little mini-project.

Scott Lyons
