Subject: Re: Coil, EGR Filter or None of the Above?

Hey Kevin,

The EGR filter is not in the engine compartment, but underneath, on the left
hand side, just above the valve cover. If it's not there, then it fell off
and chances are that your engine is sucking in fresh air through the hole
(not a good thing, as lean running causes overheating). This theory is also
consistent with the symptoms you describe: the engine stalling when too
lean. This may not as much a problem on the cold engine because the open
aux. bypass valve acts on the AFM to provide a lightly richer mixture.
