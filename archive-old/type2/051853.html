&gt; Adam,
&gt; Kymco may be closing temporarily for a few days to a week. The business
has
&gt; been for sale and we have several prospects for purchase. i hope if all
goes
&gt; well that the transition will be smooth and w/o incident. I will try to
keep
&gt; everyone posted otherwise.  As for the original jet order, i have only
been
&gt; able to locate the 45 idle jets and that is it! I will keep trying though.
&gt; Thank you for your patronage and paitence,
&gt; Ronnie at kymco.
