Subject: FS:  Westy Fiberglas Poptop from '77 $85.00

I'm about to send my '77 parts camper to the junkyard, to be 
replaced in my driveway with my newly acquired '87 parts Vanagon. 
(The wife has a strict rule - no more than one parts bus in the 
driveway at a time!) I'm thinking of removing the poptop and 
luggage rack, in case somebody wants to convert their bus to a 
poptop (or replace a cracked poptop).  This is the later-style 
poptop with room up top for a double bed.  Needs canvas and a good 
cleaning, but no cracks or damage.

I would sell both pieces for $85.00 if anyone wanted to pick them 
up here in the Philadelphia/Allentown area. 

Also have a few other parts from the '77 that I took off and don't 
think I'll use - louvered windows, doors, top plaid mattress, gas 
tank, etc. etc.
