Subject: Fwd: Hurricane Wilma

Erin: Thanks a lot for that link. Our son and his wife and family 
fled Naples FL on Sunday a few hours before Wilma's eye swept ten 
miles from their neighborhood and returned yesterday to find their 
house intact.
I'll pass this on to him so he can relive the moment when he can finally relax.
