Subject: Upper case bolt sleeve

I was wondering if the sleeve that the upper drivers side mounting
bolt slides through is available separately?  I could have sworn that
it was in the case when it went to the machine shop oh so many months
ago but it's not there now.  My understanding is that they are on all
universal cases.  

This sleeve was the main reason I didn't finnish putting the engine
back into the car late Monday.  There were a couple of minor things like
the bolt I had that fit my homemade Hoover Bit and I'd like to replace
the cooling flaps return spring.

That sleeve is my main concern.  I quickly looked at the Bus Depot site
and my RMMW and Bus Boys catalog.  Nada.  I'll check Aircooled_dot_net and 
Berg but was hoping for a quick answer.  If not,  I have a few local
wrecking yards and VW FLAPS I can call.

Anybody, Anybody?
