&gt; &gt;I just got mine today.
&gt; &gt;Haven't unpacked it yet, but the first thing I noticed is that it is not Mexican.
&gt; &gt;It is from Volkswagen do Brasil Ltda.

My &quot;Mexican&quot; engines have Mexican heads but a Brazilian dual-relief case.
They came in spanish-language VW cartons with &quot;Made in Mexico&quot; stickers.
They have run fine for years.
