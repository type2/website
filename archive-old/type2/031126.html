&gt; quesiton, i recently acquired a 77 with stock 2.0 FI engine, i have been

&gt; should i look for on a engine that has been sitting for about 2yrs?

I have had nothing but fuel injected VW's since my wife got her 74, 412
wagen...they work, they work very well.  right now I have a 78 FI with
auto tranny and it is by far the most powerful, smooth running, responsive
(with the correct Dizzy not the .009) bus I have ever had, and I've had a
bunch....what te fuel injection is, is that it is different!

learn the differences, take your time and you will not be disappointed.

BTW, usually the Black box is the last thing to go wrong, it is almost
always something else.  leaky hoses is the #1 problem
