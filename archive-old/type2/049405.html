Subject: [T2] re:tent poles and anyone in Portland Oregon

Well thanks for the responses on where to get tent poles.  A kind soul sent me
the link to Joe Clarks tent pages. (Thanks for posting all that tent info Joe)
This page in particular which has all the info for my White Stag bus tent.
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/images/wstag.gif

On this page it has a listing that says for tent parts send a check or MO to
Hirsch Weis tent frame parts at 5203 S. E. Johnson Creek Blvd.  Portland
Oregon.  I have searched in yellow pages on the net and for  a webpage.  Would
any one in Portland know if this company is still in business? Maybe under
another name?

I have no way to tell how old the instruction sheet is but since it is for a
bus, odds are its over 20 years old, so........

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
