relevation! up in the top bunk of my 75 westy, i wondered whether the
rubber stops that support poptop pipes would double as dropgate rubber
stops. i pulled some off  77 westfalias this weekend at the junkyard, and
found on the later westies they are not only the same size as those on the
dropgates, but they are black. my westy has white ones (yet another color
issue)    - steve
