Subject: Re: [T2] LED Replacements for Tail Lights

&lt;&lt; Perhaps it's just my Bus or it was another cost-cutting measure by VW, but 
my taillight assembly does not have a reflective surface inside.  Instead, 
it's just gray plastic back there, and it DOES NOT reflect ANY light back 
out the lens.  Perhaps this is why the tail and stop lights are so dim...? &gt;&gt;

And what's YOUR favorite cost cutting measure...?-(
The non-removable apron...?
