&gt;And not exposed to sunlight or the atmosphere.  Lots of plastic parts
&gt;deteriorate faster than the metal parts in our buses, and modern cars use
&gt;plastic for critical and stressed applications.  I also doubt that
&gt;the manufacturers will support the electronics more than 15 years down the

My bus has lots of plastic parts that are deteriorating or completely 
gone.  Where did you find an all-metal bus?

Hmmm, I'm not going to get into a public pissing match over old vs. new 
cars.  I am mature enough to realize that they both have their strengths 
and weaknesses.  I would however be happy to explain some of the strengths 
of newer cars offline to those who think their 30-year-old VW is the best 
vehicle that ever was, period.
