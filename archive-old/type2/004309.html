Subject: [T2] Welder opinion
&gt;. I was looking at the
&gt;sears gasless 80 amp mig welder. Any opinions on this welder? I have
&gt;never seen or used one myself.  It's main purpose will be to replace or
&gt;repair a few panels on my bus and for future tinkering

Adequate for tinkering- if that's all you ever want to do....
However, once you start welding, the projects escalate very rapidly,
and a toy welder is not going to do it. the gasless mig makes big splatter,
nasty unprofessional welds, and requires the flux-core wire in expensive small
spools. Go to a local welding supply where they sell equipment and ask for
a demonstration ( they will let you try the machine) . you will soon see the difference.
You don't need 220v. equipment for bus projects, and it isn't very portable.
Try 110 v. welders, with and without inert gas.Thank the man, and then go buy it
at Harbor Freight .
