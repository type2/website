Subject: [T2] 70 bus in Denton, MD junkyard

Volks,

I got a call from this yard that they had just pulled in a '70 deluxe
9-passenger bus and were parting it.  I went and made an offer for the
whole thing, but they want to part it themselves.  I have taken:
the rear lights (which I will keep for the '67);
the 3-wide middle seat (which I am interested in getting rid of);
and the steering column (which I am interested in getting rid of).  
The rest of the bus is there.  If you are interested, contact them, not
me. It is *way* too far for me to truck over and strip, plus they want
retail prices for the bits.

I have put a photopage at:

If anyone is interested in the 3-wide middle seat, let me know.  I paid
$30 for it and would want that for it.  I *WILL NOT* ship it!  it is *way*
too heavy and bulky!  I will hold it for pickup.

                           H Steven Dolan
