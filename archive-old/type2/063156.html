Mike,
        You will know, or at least have some idea on the condition of 
your case when you mate the halves with the new bearings and crank.  If 
the crank binds or has any out of spec play, you have problems.  Also, the 
nuts on the the studs along the barrel openings should torque up in a way 
that would give you some confidence.  I once tried to rebuild a unline 
bored case and it proved to be junk, the crank bound up and I used it in 
a spare engine.  The case did fail when I used it as a temporary engine 
in my '67.  Oh well.... Gary Gibson
