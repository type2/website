&gt;&gt;I got an NSK at Snap-On about five years ago for about fifty dollars.
&gt;&gt;Beautiful piece of work. It's probably the best tool I own. &quot;Dial Caliper,&quot;
&gt;&gt;it calls itself, measures both ID and OD. Moves smooth as glass.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;        Probably not as accurate as a micrometer, but it's likely good
&gt;enough for VW work. A micrometer *should* be a highly accruate (+/- .001&quot;)
&gt;instrument, while a Caliper will likely have a slightly looser tolerance
&gt;(+/- .002-.005&quot; or more, depending on the qualitly of the manufacturer).

It's a dial caliper, accurate (it says) to within .001.
