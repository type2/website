&gt; &gt;and the 009 is &quot;space age&quot; technology? This Cracks me up!
&gt; 
&gt; I was merely making the point that Volkswagen distributors when found in 
&gt; crates in peoples basements
&gt; are 25 years old and not trustworthy enough to use (IMHO) on a brand new 
&gt; engine. 

Dave Easterwood already addressed this one, and I agree with him.  And I
have not seen any evidence that points to mechanical advance
distributors being more reliable than vacuum advance distributors.

&gt;Your vacuum advance 
&gt; stops working and you blow the motor, all because you want to have blind 
&gt; faith in VW's stock distributor. 

You are not going to blow your engine if the vacuum advance stops working.
You might lose a little power, that's all.

&gt;I advise YOU to 
&gt; read Muir on the why centrifigal advance is more reliable than vacum.  

I haven't read that, but no matter what it says, it's one man's opinion.

&gt; What I'm saying is Learn to drive your volkswagen! If it means riding the 
&gt; clutch alittle to smooth the dead spot, then do it. Don'be a baby about a 
&gt; little hesitation!!!!!

Sorry, I can't accept that.  To me, a more appropriate comment might be, 
&quot;Stand up and do something about that hesitation - don't be a baby and put 
up with it&quot;.  It's got nothing to do with learning how to drive.
