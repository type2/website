this is correct. However, every different brand of O2 sensor is slightly
different, so you have to get the chart for YOUR sensor, not just &quot;a&quot;
sensor. I'll get guys writing me arguing that they are all &quot;equivalent&quot;, but
they are not. They can be used in the same manner, but I guess I'm just more
anal about getting my A/F mixture right on instead of just &quot;close&quot;.

I have more info on our units:

NTK O2 sensors, and the gauge is calibrated for THAT sensor (4 wire). I'm
having 50 made, and they should be ready within 4 weeks. Our kit is a simple
thing to hook up, so if you are kinda' clumsy, or don't have time for
&quot;building&quot; your own unit, this is the way to go.
