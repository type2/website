Subject: '71 Front Emblem Query
Mime-Version: 1.0

	Anyone have any source for a '71 front emblem other than BFY?	I ordered
the one advertised in their catalog together with the press in plastic clip
set.  What I received was the correct sized chrome emblem but with attached
studs and nuts to attach from the back side.

	BFY said that the clips were no longer available and that this is how they
were reproduced.  Went over to the barn to look at the bus and determined
that it was impossible to attach nuts from the inside of the bus.  For one
reason the mounting holes do not go through to the inside - hence the
plastic fasteners !

	Finally was told by BFY that I should &quot;turn down the studs and use screws
from the outside.

	What have others done for the 68-71 emblem?  I still can't believe that it
was reproduced with nuts!
