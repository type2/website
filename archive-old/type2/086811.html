Subject: Re: [T2] Stupid mistake?

William,

If you laid the crank out as shown in the book and then put your rods on
with the markings shown by the book, you are ok....

The big thing is that you got the cam and crank gear markings(the 3
dots) lined up properly before you buttoned up the block....sounds like
you did ok on that though.

The only thing that would make your engine run backwards would be the
wrong cam.

You probably have one(or more) of 4 things wrong.

Valve adjustment, spark plug firing order, ,distibutor out 180
degrees, points adjustment.


Remember the 4 cycles?  suck, squeeze, ingite, exhale.

Find top dead center by having your son rotate the engine while you watch
the valves on number 1 cylinder and then compare everything from there.
Remember the cycles!

Then compare where the rotor is with the pictures in the book.

Good luck, dave

&gt; I'm new here, but me and my son are redoing a 1970 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my problem. After re-building the engine and putting it in the bus 
&gt; I started to troubleshoot it as to why it backfired and would not run.
&gt; 
&gt; When I took out a spark plug and disconnected the coil I noticed that when 
&gt; the starter turned the engine over there was no pressure coming out of the 
&gt; spark plug hole.  In fact I could detect a suction!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; When I had my son to manually turn the crank counter-clockwise (opposite of 
&gt; what the starter does right?) I then could detect some pressure coming out 
&gt; of the spark plug hole.
&gt; 
&gt; I can remember that I aligned the two dots on one gear with the one dot on 
&gt; the other gear when I mated the camshaft with the crankshaft.
&gt; 
&gt; When I laid the rods and crank into the case did I orient the rods to be at 
&gt; bottom dead center instead of top dead center?
&gt; 
&gt; I think this means I am going to have to pull the engine, crack the case, 
&gt; and reset the crank and rods?  Right?
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; My son said we should get a starter that goes counterclockwise, but then 
&gt; the fan would not cool the jugs!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!!?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well, this project is more therapy and fun, so I don't mind the time and 
&gt; cost too much.
&gt; 
&gt; After you finish laughing, any guidance would be appreciated.
