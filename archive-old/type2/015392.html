&gt;Hi Tim;
&gt;
&gt;I have an interesting question that's a follow-up to your comments, of
&gt;sorts.
&gt;

All the lunched air cooled motors I have replaced failed prematurely due to:

1. Aftermarket oil coolers, some with garden hose setups, some with temp
controlled thermostats and Catapillar hydrolic fittings and hoses.

2. Dialing in a few extra degrees to pep things up or compensate for poor
idle caused by another weakness.

3. Holey cooling tin or otherwise compromised cooling system.

4. Chevy machinists and Ferrari mechanics. (see next)

5. Failure to verify specs during assembly and setup (GEX, et al).

6. Not monitoring the oil level.

7. Lots of miles with lack of maintenance, tar in the crankcase, ect.

8. Mixing parts that are available 'cause it's &quot;cheaper&quot; to use what ever
is handy than finding and buying the proper parts, at least until the motor
goes phuut.

In every case, non-stock parts and procedures.

If you have the sleightest evidence of pre-ignition with stock settings and
current panther pee gasoline, back off the timing a coupla degrees and/or
set the mixture at the rich end of stock spec. If everything else is stock
you won't even notice the difference.
