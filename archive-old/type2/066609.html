Subject: part # needed for BN-2 gas heater fuel pump

Hi,

I've got a Ebersacher BN-2 gas heater, but I need a part # for the 
metering fuel pump for it.  It doesn't appear to be in the manual.
Also, the name of the manufacturer would be handy.

My pop is in Germany for a week and I was hoping to give him some info
so he can hopefully find a new pump for me.

Thanks a heap,
...Markus
