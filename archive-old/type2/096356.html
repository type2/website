&gt; I am once again thinking about tearing my bus a part and putting it back 
&gt; together.  This is going to be a large and complicated project.   I 
&gt; want to come up with some sort of plan.  Having never taken this kind of 
&gt; project on before so I really don't know where to start.

I have always felt that this is such a huge project that most folks (not
all) get bored with it long before it is finished, and then there sits a
half finished bus that rusts away or hauled away


personally I fix mine in modules so I can drive it between segments of
work, like last fall I did the whole front end, beam, shocks, steering,
brakes etc.  spring I did body work.  I usually try to take two weeks one
in the spring and one in the fall to do major repairs to bus.  thus for
one week or so I do bus full time.  then get back to enjoying it (most) of
the other 50 weeks

&gt; I already have all the various repair manual and think I can fix or get 
&gt; fixed just about anything.  I also have almost all of the original 
&gt; documentation for the camper and accessories.  I already do much of my own 
&gt; mechanical work for all my cars and motorcycles, even the new ones.

thus you will probably have most of the tools and basic knowledge this
will help a lot.
