Subject: Re: Re: Cylinder head temp?

How important is it to know the head/oil temperature? I'm sure that question will start many people's hearts pumpin, so respond directly if you like. Which one is more important? I have an empty space where my clock used to be (another e-mail) and wondered if I should consider eventually installing a temp guage of some sort. Do people find they use them? I also have a 79 2.0L engine, but it's in a 77 Bus.
