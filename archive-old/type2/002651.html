    However on top of all this, I am thinking about the iminent conversion
&gt;to unleaded.

Hi Tristan

There's been loads of discussion on this topic on the list and RAMVA and the
uk VW aircooled newsgroup. Your engine will take unleaded OK already.

Don't even think about one of these catalysers. They only work in your
imagination once you've shelled out your brass.

UK is providing additives for cars that need them but you won't.
