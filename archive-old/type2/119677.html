Subject: Re: [T2] VW van, how to tighten side view mirrors?

&lt;&lt; Is there an easy fix for this?  I don't see any way to dismantle the 
mirrors.  I've tried taping
them but it works only temporarily.
 &gt;&gt;

If anyone else has a better solution, I'm more than interested...
I've replaced a few broken mirrors (just the glass, luckily), but
only by gently prying the chrome away from the glass and letting
the mirror fall out onto a safe surface. Once the glass is out, 
you'll see a spring-loaded bolt that holds the mirror frame to
the arm. Tightening this slightly increases the tension and keeps
the mirror from moving once it's set into position...&quot;Course, now
you've got to replace the mirror...I've used caulk to set the mirror,
but I'm open to a better suggestion...
