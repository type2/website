Volks

I actually got this info the other day but like a good little boy I waited
til friday.  in any case

I have mentioned a machinist who has done quite a bit of work for me over
the years, really knows his way around VWs, well stopped in to pick up a
head he was rebuilding for me, and he tells me that the end of the month
he is throwing in the towel.  not because he is losing money or that he
doesn't like the work, but as he puts it &quot;I can read the handwriting on
the wall&quot;  ??? 

so he explains, that he has actually seen an (copy) internal xx Company
memo that outlines how they (this company and others) will put the
independent shops out of business.  Among other things they plan to start
charging several thousand dollars each for shop manuals and make sure
there are significant changes annually,  certain key parts will be dealer
only, and cracking down on aftermarket parts and stores (Pep Boys was
mentioned by name!).  also things like cores etc will no longer be
accepted, &quot;you buy it new or you don't get it&quot;

So far as he knows only FIAT has refused to sign on to this policy.

now does this have anything to do with VW cracking down on web
sites??? who knows?  But I do know this guy in over 20 years has never
given me bad info.

you now know pretty much all that I know, except that a top notch VW
engine machinist is not going to be avaliable anymore (he got a competeing
offer in a different industry that he couldn't refuse so it pushed his
timetable up a little)

Obviously this will not have an immediate effect, and may take a long time
to catch up with these old VW's but the mechanics and FLAPS make thier
money on the Chxxys and Fxxds etc not on the little bit we spend.

after a while RMMW, Bus Depot, WCM and the others will no longer be able
to get key parts and then we have a black market in parts like the R-12
freon that is now $100 or so per lb when it used to be $10.

sure some guys like Dr Tim and others will hang in longer, but eventually
they will stop making money and have to pay their bills somehow, or just
retire.

just needed to get that out into the open.....

Bob
