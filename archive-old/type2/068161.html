Tim,
  It sounds like you're missing the water tank (plastic that is inside your
ice box behind the cooler part... you'll have to take it out of  the bus to
see.... the hole in top is for a pump with spigot for the tank and the hole
in bottom is for two drain hose, one for the icebox drain and one for the
water tank,,,      PINK  '66 Westy
