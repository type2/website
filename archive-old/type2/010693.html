FOR SALE 1963 VW Camper. Cleveland Heights, Oh  $2750 obo

I regret to announce the sale of my formerly beloved '63. Too many
months left alone in the garage and she  does'nt want to be used as a
storage locker anymore.

 12 Volt  Non pop top  camper with bench seat. Good wood interior. Low
cancer  - battery box and rocker panel under  side doors need work .
Good 1.6 liter  motor , good transmission and reduction boxes, good
brakes and tires. Instrumentation includes VOLTMETER, OILPRESSURE and
OIL TEMPERATURE.  Front axle good

Could probably be driven anywhere if &quot;tweaked and rubbed&quot; for a couple
days.

Caveats:  Really needs painting and body work on the &quot;ding&quot; at the left
rear of the vehicle . Right front spindle is questionable ( and has been
for last 10 years). Steering box is tired.

Email with any questions



SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE - if you don't know about valve lashes or
changing a main seal don't bug me until you've read   John  Muire's book
cover to cover!
