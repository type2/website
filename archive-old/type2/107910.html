Subject: Re: [T2] won't start....sometimes

Pull a plug when it won't start and see if it's wet with gas.  That'll give
you a clue.

You can take the cold start valve out of the equation by pulling off its
electrical plug and trying to start the engine again, holding the throttle
wide open to give the engine plenty of air.

If you're smelling gas it probably *is* flooding, now you need to determine
why.  I don't see mention on new injectors so there's always a chance one or
more of them are stuck open, or leaking badly.

Subject: [T2] won't start....sometimes


&gt; Installed new cylinders, pistons, heads, new points, plugs, wires, cap,
coil,
&gt; condensor, alternator, new double relay, fuel pump, replaced much old fuel
&gt; and vacuum lines, hoseclamps, alternator belt, as well as miscelaneous
wiring.
&gt;
&gt; Got it running fine for two days.  The second day of running we backed it
up
&gt; a steep driveway (reverse)...kind of sputtered and gave us much less power
&gt; than usual.  Many hours later when we went to leave, it wouldn't start.
Had it
&gt; towed...looked it over, checked a few things, still wouldnt run.  The next
&gt; morning it turned right over and ran fine - the first time.  But after
turning it
&gt; off, the second time it wouldnt start at all.  I can smell gasoline, i
think
&gt; that is the cold start valve.  After looking at it further and setting the
idle
&gt; and timing AGAIN, it ran (last night).  This morning, however, it started
&gt; right up then died after 15-20 seconds of idling.  After that it hasn't
started
&gt; since.  I got up at 7 to drive to Cape  Cod to get it looked at by a pro,
but
&gt; i'm still here.
&gt;
&gt; I can eliminate a few things:  There is fuel and fuel pressure; the
battery
&gt; is fine.  Plus everything we've replaced during this overhaul (listed
above).
&gt;
&gt; My initial thought is that the cold start is flooding the engine, so in
the
&gt; morning (after sitting all night), the gas has evaporated and the engine
is
&gt; dry, so it starts up.  But that wouldn't explain why it died in idle this
&gt; morning, right?  We've been through this engine numerous times, and the
only
&gt; conclusion we can make is sometimes it starts, sometimes it doesn't.  One
moody motor.
&gt;  See if you can help me, if so that would be great.
