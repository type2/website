Well it's an electrical device so I would chase that first. verify that 
the light will go out when disconnected from the oil pressure sender. If 
not then it's possible you have some portion of the wire that is 
grounding before it gets to the sensor and causing the light to stay on. 
Should this test pass and it will go out when disconnected and operate 
properly when connected, check the sender with a VOM just to verify it 
has a connection to ground when not running but upon startup it will 
open the connection and not show a connection. After all of this if it 
doesn't indicate a bad wiring or bad sender beg or borrow a mechanical 
oil pressure gage and confirm the actual operating oil pressure. Hope 
it's one of the first two things.
