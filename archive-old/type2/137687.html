Subject: Re: [T2] minimum compression

Wilson considers compression of 95 and above acceptable if the engine
is okay in all other respects as you describe, providing all readings
are within 75% of the highest reading (p. 15).

Manufacturors calculate normal compression test readings from
compression ratio, so yes, if you have lowered ratio, then even a new
engine will read lower than factory specs.

 What if the head compression ratio has been lowered.  Would the 100psi
 minimum then change?
 
 An additional question...if a leak down test showed practically no leak
 down, and the compression was still 100 psi or lower, what would be your
 thoughts on that?
 
 The engine in question runs well, pushes a baywindow to 80mph and gets
 20+mpg on the hiway...and uses practically no oil...
 
 Just wondering....
