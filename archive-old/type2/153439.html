Subject: RE: [T2] Running rich when warm issue is back (On my knees 
  begging for help)

I was just thinking. Could it be possible that instead of it killing it with
too much gas maybe its doing the opposite and cutting off the air supply
somehow? I'm afraid my bulk of experience with working on FI has been mostly
with rx7's (owned 5). Is there any type of choke or something in the
throttle body that would restrict airflow until the system warms up? I know
these Bosch units run an air temp sensor in the AFM. Does anybody have what
the specs on this should be?
