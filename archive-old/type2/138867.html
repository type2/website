Subject: Tire noise

There is a repetitive noise that's been driving me nuts lately and I seemed
to have traced it to one of my Continental CR21 tires that I bought 2 years
ago.

If I rotate tires, the noise moves with the tire. I'm not sure what to be
glad of at this point although it's sort of a relief it's not CV or bearing
noise. Anyway, the tire looks perfectly fine to the eye.

Has anyone had a similar experience?

PS. Along with proper tire inflation, keep the front end lubed. It makes
steering so much easier. I always forget about this.
