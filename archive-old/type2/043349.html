Subject: Leaded and Unleaded fuel. European and US markets

Hi,
	It's my understanding that the pancake/type4 engines were universal,
they were designed and built to run either leaded or unleaded fuel as long
as it has adequate octane rating (91RON).

 The upright/type-1 engines, however were deleted from the US market in
1972, though they continued to be available in other markets up to (and
beyond) 1979.
 There are, apparently, different part numbers for heads intended for the US
market and heads intended for other markets. The distinction being that the
US market heads were engineered to use unleaded fuel, whereas the others
were not. I don't think that there's an easy answer to the question
&quot;Can my European 1600cc engine run unleaded fuel without modification&quot;
because it depends on build dates, engine numbers, subsequent modifications
and also, to a significant extent, on your driving style and use of the 
vehicle.

 The one piece of advice I would offer with some confidence is that it could
well be a mistake to trust a posting from the net from someone who believes
themselves to be fully informed of your situation when their situation is
different. I don't mean to run down any individual who's contributed to
this thread, merely to point out that it's very easy for anyone to hand out
advice on the net, and that the onus is very solidly on the reader to assess
the value of that advice (and I include this posting in that).

 Many upright bus engines will run happily on unleaded fuel, however there
is
evidence to suggest that some will not. Check carefully the history of your
engine and consider your options.

Cheers,
	 W.
