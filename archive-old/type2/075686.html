Brian,

As someone else mentioned, you can buy all the bits you need to build a
*new* beam for your bus.  I am in the process of replacing yet another
rusted beam on a bus.  This is number 4 or 5 for me (I (try to) forget
:-), so I have a bit of experience here (more than I want, really :-)

First,  some pictures...

http://www.everybus_dot_com/beam/index.htm

These are pictures of the new Beam I just bought from Bus Depot and of the
dead beam I am salvaging some parts from.  The dead beam came from Jeff
Stewart's new '76 (Jeff, post the URL for your bus pics :)  The bus is
really nice looking, but this beam is as scary a hunk of rust as ever I
have seen!

On replacing your front end, there are levels.  Depending on your bus,
you may or may not have to do all of them.  I have listed them below from
big to small...

First, the beam itself.  If it is rusty, you need to replace it.  As you
see and as other have said, Bus Depot has them for $349 (- list discount)
and they are *pretty*.  Worth every penny and $250 less than VW wanted
back when they sold them (maybe they still do?  I dunno, but I can't
afford $600!!!)

Second,  ball joints.  Bus boys offers rebuilt trailing arms with new ball
joints pressed in for ?$175? plus core.  You will not find German ball
joints + labor for less, so I recommend ordering from them, unless you
have a press and the jig to press them with.

Third, tie rods and drag link.  I cannot imagine putting on new ball
joints or beam without replacing these.  Both Bus Depot and Bus Boys have
these.  From Bus Depot, all three (both tie rods and drag link) total just
under $100.

Fourth, swing lever (relay arm) repair kit.  $27.95 from Bus Depot, I
imagine Bus Boys would have it as well.

Adding it up, plus a couple other small parts I have not mentioned, you
come to close to $700 for a complete *new* front end.

Both vendors carry most of the parts you need, each is sole supplier for
one of them, so you will be ordering from both.

Or you can buy a good used beam, but they are not that much less and there
are risks.  I am replacing the beam on my '73 for the second time in 5
years of ownership.  The original beam rusted out so I went looking and
found a very nice looking beam locally.  Bought it and put it on.  Now
that beam is rusting out.  The problem with beams is that they rust from
the inside out, so at the first sign of rust, it is way too late.  A beam
can look perfect on the outside and be thin and crusty on the inside.
There is no way to tell until it shows. :-(

Lastly, installation.  I have an article in the library on what I do, take
a look at it.  It is a big job, but if you have a friend or two to help,
it is very do-able at home.  Or you can pay someone to do it.  Last I
checked, the shop I use when I am out of time or it is too cold to work
wanted $600 in labor to flop a new beam on.  Since this is an honest
all-day to two-day job, I regard that as a very fair price!
