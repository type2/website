&gt; Hello everyone---Had a successful Engine pull---with the help of my friend 
&gt; Julio--I want to replace the Push Rod Tubes and Seals---but i am having 
&gt; trouble getting the darn things out---any helpful hints about getting these 
&gt; out---Dummy book says to gently use pliers and they come right out---well 
&gt; they dont seem to be coming out---I have 71 1600 DP engine---that is out of 
&gt; the car and the underneath tins are off---Thanks for the help--Adam

That instruction only applies to the type 4 engine.  To replace the
pushrod tubes on a type 1 engine you have to remove the heads.  For an
emergency fix they do make expanding tubes.
