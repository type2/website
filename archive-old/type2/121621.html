Okay let's start over.

There are at least THREE different trannies used in 72-79 busses.

Here are the basics:
72-73 used a 3-rib 002 with 5.375 final drive and .82 4th gear, 210mm flywheel
74-75 used a 3 or 5-rib 002 with 4.87 final drive and .88 4th gear, 215mm 
flywheel
76-79 used a 6-rib 091 with a 4.56 final drive and .88 4th gear, 228mm flywheel

I haven't quite figured out the whole 74-75 thing though.  The manuals do 
not agree.
I am sure that 75 used a 5-rib tranny which was 4.86 with .88 4th gear.  I 
have one on the shelf in my garage.
I am not sure whether 74 was a 3 or 5 rib so 75 may indeed be one year only
I am sure that at least some 74's came with the 4.87 final drive but not 
sure if they were 3 or 5 rib.  Maybe a midyear change?  Or maybe two 
different trannies.
If you have a '74 tranny with three ribs, I would recommend verifying the 
ratios.

&gt;(pyramid shaped. . . Im not sure I understand, as it
&gt;looks like a Volkswagen transmission when I look at
&gt;it, not a pyramid).

The shape of the ribs, when viewed from the front or rear resembles a pyramid.

&gt;   Is the one year only due to the
&gt;gearing ratio, thus making it an internal difference
&gt;(so it would still work with the 72 motor)?

Not sure if it is one or two year, but either way it will bolt up to the 72 
motor with no problems.
72-75 are all completely interchangeable, as long as the clutch size 
matches the flywheel size.

&gt;  What does
&gt;this mean for my bus? Better freeway gas milage? A
&gt;higher top speed? Should I make it a point to get one?

Compared to the 72-73 tranny, the 74-75 tranny will be about the same in 
4th gear and 10% taller in 1st-3rd gears.  If you are pulling heavy loads 
the 72-73 tranny might be a better choice, otherwise the 74-75 is generally 
easier to drive around town.

&gt;Or is the 76-9 transmission the best bet (meaning that
&gt;I need to get a flywheel, clutch assembly etc too)

*I* don't think it's the best bet, although it is a slightly better 
transaxle.  There are fitment issues and the ratios may be too tall for 
your bus.  I would stick with an 002 tranny

&gt;I dont know about anyone else, but at 65 MPH the
&gt;extra top on the Rivera starts making its presence
&gt;known. There is still plenty of pedal left but I feel
&gt;like the had of god is resting on my windshield
&gt;telling me to slow down.

Then I would recommend staying with an 002 tranny, either one should be fine.
