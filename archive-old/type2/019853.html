Subject: 68-69 Master Cylinders

I picked up the master cylinder from Advance Auto this morning.  They
said it is for a 1968 Transporter and it costs $38.99 with core
exchange.  It appears identical to the master cylinder I took off the
1968 Adventurewagen, which I'm not sure is OEM, because the switch
sending units on the old one are two-prong, whereas the wiring harness
on the bus has three connectors. However, the senders did not come with
the rebuilt unit, so maybe the senders have been replaced on the camper.

Advance also told me that the same cylinder would fit my 1969 Single
Cab, this runs contrary to what I've heard from other sources (Bus
Depot, friends, etc.).  Could the same unit work on both vehicles?  What
changed between '68 and '69 that required a different master cylinder?

Anyway, I plan to install the master cylinder tonight, wish me luck.
Everything in the system, save metal lines (I blew them out) and drums,
will have been replaced.  Hopefully the brakes will be functional by the
end of the night.
