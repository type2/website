Hi Paul,

I purchased a 1600cc longblock new case from Pozzi's two months ago for my
'67 Westy.  Immediatly took it on 800 miles home to Seattle (yes, I did
break it in and do valve adjusts).... then took it 3000 mile round trip to
Lake Havasu, Arizona from Seattle three weeks ago...  Have about 5,000 miles
total in the first two months.  Another 3000 mile trip to Arizona coming up
in 1 week!

Engine has been fine, has good power.  Was doggy at first, but after 1500
miles it picked up.

I say go with the new case.

Thom Fitzpatrick who runs the vintagebus list (1967 and earlier, your type
of engine!) is who recommended them to me.

Hi all,

It's time for a long block for &quot;Mary&quot;

I live in Sacramento and the two main source are
Bugformance and Pozzi's

Both have 12,000 miles, 12 month warranty

Bugformance:
$725 + $250 Core

Pozzi's
$715 + $175 Core
$110 for new case.

Has anybody have experience with either?
