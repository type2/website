Ted,

Do NOT use undercoat on the inside of your bus. 3 reasons:

1. If it gets hot in summer, you will hate yourself for the tar smell
2. Future restorers will hate you when they will have to remove it
3. You will only notice rust when it is too late.

Guess, how I know ...

What I started doing on my vehicles in Germany is to totally remove all undercoating there is, wirebrush (or preferably sandblast) all rust away down to the bare metal or still existing original paint (if it withstands a wire brush, there is no rust under it), use Fertan (turns remaining rust in the pores into some other black substance), apply a couple coats of good rustproofing primer (no POR 15), apply 2 coats of regular car paint, and then seal it (and reseal it every fall, with cavity wax (the stuff you use to fight rust inside of frame rails and rocker panels.
If you still want undercoating, do not use the black tar stuff, but switch to a modern PVC or wax based one that comes in light color (they do not dry out as fast and the light color gives you a chance to spot rust before it becomes a serious problem.

Cheers,
Marcus
