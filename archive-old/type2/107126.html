Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel gauge calibration

Guys,

I got another 1/8 tank on a new fuel sender gauge by pulling the 
instrument cluster and tightening the two nuts on the gauge end slightly 
and reseating anc checking all of my grounds on the instrument cluster.

I had two ground wires that were loose and when I tried to bend the tabs
slightly, both broke...replaced tham and all was fine.

Haven't filled up yet again, but symptoms sound the same as me....and I 
*did* adjust the sender before installing it!

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I just recently replaced my fuel gauge sender. Since then when I fill the tank
&gt; &gt; the needle on the gauge only goes to about three quarters full. With the old
&gt; &gt; sender the needle would go to full but then drop to empty at half full and no
&gt; &gt; longer register. Could this new sender be faulty or is there a way to
&gt; &gt; calibrate the fuel gauge? I know on the earlier bays there was a screw on the
&gt; &gt; back of the gauge to calibrate it. Can anyone confirm that this screw is on my
&gt; &gt; 78 before I have to take apart the instrument panel?
&gt; 
&gt; I think this screw you are talking about is on the fuel gauge vibrator and
&gt; should be the last thing you test.  Follow Jamie's procedure for testing the
&gt; system:

&gt; 
&gt; If the vibrator is at fault, I have a used one for you. New ones are $35.
