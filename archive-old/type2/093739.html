Subject: RE: Help - Clutch won't disengage

&gt;a couple of hours, when I got back home it was really
&gt;hard to get into gear and once in 1st I could no
&gt;longer disengage the clutch.  What has broken or needs
&gt;an adjustment?

Sounds like your pilot bearing has gone to pieces.  It's located in the end
of the crankshaft and fits around the tranny input shaft.  If it starts to
shread, it causes the tranny input shaft to want to turn all the time the
engine is running and makes it feel just like the clutch isn't disengaging.
Fits all the symptoms you described.  Cheap part, but unfortunately it
requires removal of the engine to replace.
