&gt; I'm pretty sure it was flooded/fouled on Saturday, and that's why it

&gt; trying to fire after a while.

&gt; So, re-reading the earlier posts, I may have low voltage from old cables
&gt; that may be too weak to crank an engine that may have an over-rich
&gt; condition.

What if the cold-start valve was running constantly?
