Subject: Re: [T2] Spot weld drill bits....

&lt;&lt; Hey all,

I went to Sears and a couple other tool stores and no one had or knew where I 
could get a spot weld drill bit.

Anyone have any ideas? And, are they all one size, or is there a particular 
one that I need?

Thanks &gt;&gt;

Try:

&lt;&lt;www.eastwoodco_dot_com&gt;&gt;

They'll also sell you a spot welder to put it back together...
