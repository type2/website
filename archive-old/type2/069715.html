Subject: In which I jinx my bus...

Today my wife's Honda elected not to run. 200K miles on it. Symptoms point
to a fuel problem. Okay, sez I, I'll fix it this weekend.

&quot;I guess we'll have to take the VW BUS,&quot; sez I to the Cruise Director. &quot;It
is more reliable than your Japaneeeeez car. Ha! Ha, ha, ha!&quot; I enjoyed this
very much.

So four hours later (you know what's coming, don't you?) I lose first and
second gear.

Looks like I have a very greasy weekend ahead of me. Which listy was it who
lost his own first and second this week? I deleted that stuff. Something
about the nose cone.
