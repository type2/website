&gt; I have a 72 bus and just today I was changing the oil and the oil filter. I
&gt; changed the filter then after I drained the oil. I was putting the oil drain
&gt; nut back on and the stud snapped. I guessed I turned it to hard! I'm really
&gt; pissed off because I've snapped studs before on other VW's (not as important
&gt; as this one, mostly exhaust studs) and I know how fragile they are on these
&gt; older cars that we all love so much! All I want to know is how I go about
&gt; fixing this. I know the remainder of the stud that's left in their has to
&gt; come out. Is this an easy job? What tools do I need? Also obviously my bus
&gt; has no oil in it because of this problem will it hurt if it stayed empty
&gt; until it is fixed (probably a couple of days)? Of course it won't be started.
&gt; The engine that I am currently having this problem with is a type 4 if thats
&gt; any help!

Okay, Hercules, if you can clamp a set of vise-grips on the remaining part
of the stud, try that first. If you can clamp on a vise-grip, the stud
should just screw right out. Since this stud lives in oil, it's not likely
to be rusted in.

Also run outside quick-like and unhook the ground from your battery; this
will keep anyone else from trying to start your Bus.

A couple of days with no oil in it, so long as you don't try driving it
anywhere, shouldn't hurt your engine. (I would say won't, but absolutes are
bad here.)
