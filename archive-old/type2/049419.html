Hi Nick,

Bus-Boys_dot_com has 15% off everything ordered online,
making the complete curtain set $165.xx plus any
shipping or tax they may charge.

Busdepot_dot_com has the full set also for 199.95 plus tax/shipping

and zproducts_dot_com has the full kit for 195.00 plus tax/shipping

Im pretty sure that you will end up with the same thing regardless who you 
order them from, as they probably all came from the same place...

Regards,
Christopher

&gt;
&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I am currently looking to buy a complete curtain set (including all
&gt;hardware) for my 79 Bus.  Does anyone know where the best place to buy this
&gt;is?  I have checked many places online, but I want to make sure I get a set
&gt;that is good quality, without getting ripped off.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
&gt;
