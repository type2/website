Quoth Sean:

&gt;The vinyl covering over the driver's door panel is shrinking and sagging
&gt;a bit.

Also included with Sean's sale are a very nice matching set of like new dark
brown front door panels (match his sliding door panel, not the origional
scheme but will look very nice all the same) which have been residing with
me for too long trying to get over to him.  His origionals are a tad beat
up, the van however is a great solid running camper.  I'm sure his sale is
with a heavy heart.  The door panels if the next owner wants them need to be
picked up in north central WV or might have possible metro DC area delivery.
I might try to get them to Sean before the van goes if possible.
