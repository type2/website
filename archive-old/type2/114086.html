Subject: Re: [T2] Dallas Help ?

&gt;My dad just informed me that my new 82 Westy, (that i have yet to see) is
&gt;having major problems keeping an idle when stopped. I am completely
&gt;clueless
&gt;and a virgin to the type4 engine, what could be causing this and what is
&gt;the
&gt;fix??

Vacuum leaks and / or bad EGR valve. I had the very same problems. Got me 
my bus at a reduced price b/c the P.O. was P.o.'ed.
