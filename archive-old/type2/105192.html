&gt; If'n your jalousies
&gt; are in need of fixing up seal wise 'n stuff, go visit the Wolfsburg West

&gt; with the perimeter seal (all that used to be availabobble), and all the
&gt; welting 'n stuff to reinstall the glass to the frames, and the frames to 
the
&gt; main structure of the jalousie.  And not very expensive either IIRC...

So I wrote: Cool! Thanks, mon. I'm diggin' my jalousies, but the U-shaped 
bottom-of-the-pane welting on my louvered window is pulling out of the 
lowest pane, flapping in the breeze crustily, and showing me that it is 
NOT going back in there the way it did when installed 25 long years ago. I 
imagined that stuff was of Unobtanium and was thinking of reseating the 
pane with a bead of silicone glass caulk along that lower aluminum frame 
edge. But from Wolfsburg West for under _at_25 I can get a kit to redo the 
whole enchilada. 

OTOH, I'll bet the bead of silicone caulk would work just fine. If I use 
the clear stuff, it'll look good too. It's gluey properties might even 
hold the pane in and make it rattle less than the original setup.

Somewhere along the long and bumpy road I lost the aluminum strip that 
runs across the top edge of the lowest louver pane (originally held in by 
two small screws). Anyone got a spare one of those kicking around their 
life that they'd like to see back on the road? Then I'd be rockin' down 
the highway for sure.

Let me know.
