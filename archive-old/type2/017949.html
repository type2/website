We just went to San Diego, CA in our mechanically fine '71 and got just
over 22 mpg, with 3 kids and two big adults, and there were some long
climbs (though not real high) on Interstate 15.  Ran between 55 and 65.

I was pretty happy about it.  The best the '80 vanagon from hell got was
17 mpg--with a tailwind!  Geez, I'd love to get 28 mpg!

&gt; always drove around 55mph
