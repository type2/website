Alan, Kim and Stan,
My &quot;snapping&quot; sounded like a pre-ignition &quot;ping&quot; that you can hear in a 
water cooled engine when it is too far advanced and you push hard on the 
throttle. If the ticking is proportional to the velocity rather than the 
engine rpm (compare tick rate at the same velocity while in different gears) 
then you have a noisy cv, probably due to lack of grease. This stuff can 
leak out over time insidiously, until the joint runs dry, even though the 
boots aren't torn. You don't have to replace the boots, just remove the axle 
and add some molybdenum-base chassis grease. That was my experience, for 
what it is worth.

&gt;Looks to me like we both had the same experience. Only, I
&gt;maintained &quot;torque&quot; on the joint to heat up the grease.
&gt;
&gt;Your solution is definately better.
&gt;
&gt;I guess a jackstand is going to become a part of my arsenal.
&gt;
&gt;I order the 4 boot kits in the morning and re-do all  of the boots.
