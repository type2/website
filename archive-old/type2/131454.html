Wow. Too bad I'm in SoCal. :(

Of course, I doubt the wife would appreciate me getting it. LoL

It's a teal colored 1971 Transporter, saved from obscurity and currently in 
my driveway. Roommate has too many projects and I have been busy looking for 
a job so he said...

&quot;Why don't you help me tow that Bus to the Wrecking Yard...&quot;


=:0

So, I say &quot;I will try and find an owner who will give it a good home&quot;.

Contact me _at_ &lt;mailto:tberk_at_sbcglobal_dot_net&gt;
