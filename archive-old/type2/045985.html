Subject: [T2] Trip report - Miami or bust

So for 2 weeks it rained every day so I was 'forced' to drive 1 of the
busses to work instead of ride the 76 BMW.  Bummer huh?  I was coming
home 2 fridays ago and noticed the crosswinds were even worse than
usual.  Trouble is there weren't any winds at all that day.  I had to do
a brake adjust and grease before I left for Miami and Friday afternoon's
a good time to do such stuff.  Rears adjusted I jacked up the front, did
brake adjust, greased the front end.  Just for fun, wiggle the tires
side to side.  Sure as it rains at a Full Moon Campout, the drag link
knuckle at the steering box was so bad it scared even me.  Search by
phone and in person turned up 1 &quot;drag link&quot; that turned out to be a tie
rod end.  It's Friday afternoon, I'm leaving for Miami on Sunday.  The
locals can all have one for Monday.  Call the Bus Depot on the phone.
The UPS guy just pulled in the driveway there.  I cough up the $ for
part and overnight shipping and get on with life.

Left Sunday heading for Miami.  Don't like Miami.  The people that
operate motor vehicles there think they can drive.  I asked for this
school though and once again got what I thought I wanted.  Said good-bye
to wife and dogs, kids still asleep and wife wants the peace and quiet.
The Burrito Express grumbled to life, spat through the carbs like always
and resigned herself to running with the choppy idle big carbs, valves,
and a mild cam will do.  At the gas station check the tires and she's as
ready as she can be.

Charleston to I95 south is best done on a kind of secondary road, Rt.
17.  Good road, no surprises.  Officer Obie is still in church this time
Sunday morning, so we can noodle along listening to the throaty purr of
a wife-built 1776 running in the powerband.  Stop in Point South SC to
offload coffee then the merge onto the dreaded I95.  Hook up with a
trucker running about 75mph, the Express turning 3800 RPM and happy to
do so.  Settle in for hours of entertainment intruding into the lives of
people who think what they do in their cars is private.  The truckers
and I know different.  About once an hour the CB lights up with 'check
out the...&quot;

I can tell I'm getting close to Miami, wee cars dodging and weaving,
just to get themselves blocked in.  I laugh at their shortsightedness,
knowing time is best made minimizing stops and reading the traffic
patterns.

Found where the class is held and that sucks because I'm looking for the
hotel.  Once again, Mapquest has street #s all messed up.  Finally find
the hotel, check in and off to sleepyland after a 10 hour run.  Monday
after class call Andy to say Hi I'm in town, let's hook up.  Andy's on
the AIRS list but he's changed his listing so no phone # and me without
internet access.  Look him up in the phone book.  Senior Jose says 'Andy
no got this number tell him to tell all his friends Andy no got the
number'.  I call his work, Mrs. Andy answers and gives me the real #.
Call the right # and we banter back and forth about whatchoo wanna do?

Meanwhile back at school, the 1st 3 days are all about how to get a
job.  Wednesday morning, the class van has a flat so a bunch pile in the
Express.  On startup comes the sound on an ominous deep down knock.  I
swallow hard and ease on down the road to class.  After school, the
noise is still there.  Damn.  Wishing it away didn't work.  I go hang
out behind the Express listening at various RPMs.  The noise isn't
coming from the top end.  Sounds like a deep down center section knock.
What's strange is that there's no loss of oil pressure that's commonly
associated with losing a rod bearing.  Could be a loose rod cap, but
again, oil pressure's still up.  Either way it looks like major
surgery.  I'm bumming.

Call Andy, hey I know what we can do!  What's that?  Engine swap - any
available locally?  Call me in the morning.  Sure and Thanks.  Come by
the hotel after work and give it a listen please.  Next morning call
Andy again, Busma reigns, an engine is available in Ft Lauderdale.
After school, I pushed the Express to better space to work.  Pop valve
covers, pull rockers, check the torque on the bottom nuts as part of the
diagnosis regimen.  1&amp;2 are a tad loose but not enough to justify an
engine pull.  Reinstall rockers, adjust the valves to .004I .006E, just
like the cam manufacturer says.  Slide around to the other side, 3&amp;4
were fine.  Just setting #4 exhaust when I hear a familiar voice.  Andy
arrived in time to listen to me bitch about my choice of oil filter
location.  Reinstall valve cover.  Start her up to listen to what shakes
out.  Damn tickerknock's still there.  Hmmmm.  Hold my hands over the
exhaust tips.  THey're not really hot.  She didn't die and the exhaust
note didn't change.  Hmmmm.

Remember I was fighting a running hot problem that cured when I bowed to
the collective wisdom of the list and got rid of the progressive Weber?
I had wrapped the rear exhaust pipes on the header with heat wrap.  We
looked at the wrapping and sure as kids pick boogers, the wrap did
flap.  Cut the wrap away and we could feel the exhaust coming form the
holes.  It was _very_loud_.  We took the Express for the tour de block,
chatted about this and that for a while then he headed home to do dinner
for his kids.  I've always been extremely fortunate with Busma, and am
always astounded by what Bus folks will do to help each other out.

Andy volunteered to pick up an exhaust on his way to work, and
volunteered the parking lot where he works as a space to install.  He
even remembered an exhaust installation kit and got the good one with
metal web doughnuts.

Friday, get out of class, head over to where Andy works.  Get the tour
while the Express cools down.  Andy works in a _very_cool_place.  They
get the high test Cafe Bustelo delivered in 10lb bricks.  The
Beetlejuice waiting room is something else.  Also, the last time I saw a
stainless steel toilet was the night I spent in the Alameda city jail.
That toilet didn't have what looked like a billet stainless seat though.

Off to work.  Pull rear bumper, apron, and tin.  Old exhaust comes off
easily, the brass nuts were worth the investment.  Still have enough to
do 10 buses if anyone needs exhaust nuts.  Look at the tubing.  It has
flaked and cracked.  The wrap had insulated the tubing.  I had looked in
1 night and inside the wrap was glowing red hot whereas the rest of the
system was dark.  I bet the run down at 3800 RPMs for 10 hours heated
the metal white hot and changed it's character forever, making it hard
and causing the cracks.  A picture can be seen at
http://www.nations_dot_net/~djersey/badexhaust.jpg  New exhaust has larger
diameter tubing.  Install the manifold heater tube block off plates.  1
of the wonderful brass nuts ends up in the heat exchanger.  I say an
unkind word about my not putting a rag over the hole.  Put rag over
hole.  Andy donated never seize for the 1 ferrous nut on my exhaust.
Things are going good.

Until it's time to put the rear tin on.  Larger diameter tubing
interferes with rear tin.  Several tries to install the tin fail.  Time
to be not nice.  Out comes the 5lb percussive adjustment tool.  After
applying appropriate dents with excessive enthusiasm and banging it
close to where it belongs, we were able to get 2 of the 3 screws to hold
it in place.  The whole operation took about 2 hours.

The Burrito Express grumbles to life, much more muted.  I can hear the
valve train working.  Couldn't hear that before and it took me a second
to figure out why it sounded like my old BMW.  This new system is much
quieter than what I had.  Install rear apron just as the rain starts to
pummel us.  Quick tool pickup and dash inside to wait out the rain.
Rain about stopped, I thank Andy profusely for all his help.

Change shirt and the Express grumbles to life again, off to Mom's in St.
Petersburg.  I dislike the first run after working on anything because
I'm paying so much attention to every little sound, smell, vibration
that it's very tiring.  Driving along it looks like I'm trailing oil
smoke.  Damn.  Then I realize it's water from the road coming off the
tire.

The Express is running really good, new exhaust with back pressure has
moved the sweet spot down 400 RPM.  Temperature's a little higher but I
think that's because I have direct contact between rear tin and
exhaust.  The oil temp goes up and down, just like water temp on a water
pumper the result of load changes going up and down hills and the change
from dry to wet roads and back, water cooling the sump.

Get to Mom's 2 hours earlier than I planned, just because I planned an
extra 2 hors 'justin case',  Spend a couple days with Mom, watch
Hurricane Gordon bearing down on us.  It veers north of us so I know Mom
will be ok.  Wait a bit longer for the winds to shift so they come from
the Southwest, I'll have a tailwind home most of the way.  Say my
goodbyes to Mom.  Get blown all over the causeway, taking sea spray over
the top of the Express,  watching the campers have a harder time than I
am.  Real glad I replaced the drag link.  Can't imagine what that part
of the drive would be like with loose steering.

Tack into the crosswinds, in and out of the bands of rain.  Rain-X works
real well.  Stay out of the way of the folks in a hurry.  Settled in for
another 10 hour drive.  The tailwind keeps the oil temp way low because
the engine isn't working very hard to maintain 65mph.  See a brown
Vanagon with what sounds like an exhaust leak.  They didn't wave.  See a
blue baywindow with what looks like a homebuilt pop top.  She's busy
smoking something and didn't wave either.  Get real good gas mileage.
Merge onto 95 from 4.  Everyone's in much more of a hurry the wind
shifts to more of a headwind now.  Express working harder as shown by
oil temp and fuel usage.

Stop for gas south of Jacksonville.  Merging onto the highway and my oil
pressure shoots to infinity.  I likes a good amount of oil pressure but
off the gauge isn't good for oil coolers and lines.  Pull over, just
like I thought, the wire came off the sending unit.  Call Mom,
everything's fine, don't worry.  Call wife, suggest we hold the
Thanksgiving Misgivings campout at our farm.  A couple more fuel stops
and arrive home just before midnight.  The great marshmallow feels food
after hours in the saddle.

In all a successful road trip, a little excitement, some unexpected
wrenching.  The Express averaged 16 mpg, most of the run made at over 70
mph.  1/2 qt oil used, 1 oil filter replaced because of it's
interference with checking the torque on the left side head.  Oh yeah, 1
exhaust system.

A big thanks again to Andy Pechanek for all his help.

Mad Uncle Dave
