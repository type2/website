Subject: moving west

mobius (81 adventurewagen) is finally in shape after a long rebuild
nightmare sort of thing of which i'll spare you the gory details.  we'll be
moving from traverse city, mi to salem, oregon for a new job and life (salt
free winters!!!) on october 1.  

here's the proposed route: us 2 across michigan's upper peninsula (stay
the first night in the western u.p.).  i-35 south to minneapolis (2nd night
with friends there), then down to i-90.  i-90 through minnesota, and most
of south dakota (3rd night just east of the badlands).  continue on 90
through the black hills and into wyoming, get off on 16 and take through
yellowstone (4th night just east of yellowstone).  us-20 out of
yellowstone into idaho, and across to mountain home (5th night).  i-84 to
portland, and then i-5 south to salem (6th night).  throw stuff into storage
locker and use the van as home base for a week, hopefully finding a
decent place to live before starting work.  if not, live at the local koa or
equivalent until a place is found. 

that's the plan - any comments on those who know these areas?  any
driveway offers in the vicinity of where i'll be staying the night would be
appreciated.  but the most important thing:  reputable repair
shops/knowledgeable and kind vw folks along my route would be a good
thing to know about, as the van seems to be running 10-20 degrees
hotter (now the vdo oil temp guage gets up to 210 instead of 185) after
the rebuild.  any info would be much appreciated.

thanks and good spirit, matthew
