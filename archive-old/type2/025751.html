&gt; Just want to make sure that I'm doing this right...
&gt; 
&gt; It measure the tach with a trusty tach/dwell meter,
&gt; you hook up the same way you hook up a dwell meter?
&gt; That is, the positive to the little wire going to the
&gt; distributer and the negative/ground to ground?

Yeah. Positive on the tach to the NEGATIVE side of the coil; negative on the
tach to any ground.

This weekend's projects include putting a bolt in the engine compartment to
serve as an instrument/jump-start ground. You know how you never can find a
good ground when you need one? I figure drilling and tapping a hole on a
solid piece of metal in the engine bay and screwing a stainless steel bolt
into the hole will pay dividends some day. Smear a fingerful of axle grease
around the base of it to ward off corrosion, and I should be set.
