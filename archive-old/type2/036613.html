Subject: Re: timing, wrong year engine

According to Tom Wilson's book - &quot;How to Rebuild your Volkswagen Air-Cooled
Engine&quot; - engines with letter code &quot;GE&quot;  are listed as &quot; '79  2000(cc)
Calif. only Vanagon heads.&quot;

According to the &quot;Volkswage Official Service Manual&quot;

  Ignition timing (1975 cars            5 deg ATDC with vacuum hoses
     and 1979 and later                      connected
     Calif. cars)

  Ignition timing (1976 and              7.5 deg BTDC with vacuum
     later - except 1979 and                hoses connected
     later Calif cars)

That extra &quot;0&quot; might be an &quot;*&quot; (or some approximation thereof) indicating
the engine had been rebuilt.

So, if it's got its fuel injection, proper distributor, etc. I'd say time it
at 5 deg ATDC.  If it's got carbs, some other distributor than original,
etc. then you'll have to experiment.

Subject: timing, wrong year engine


&gt; Hello again,
&gt; I just wrote the list about the timing on a 78 engine and I
&gt; just came across the engine codes at the archive and found this.
&gt; My engine code is GE043870 and I -thought- it was a 78 engine.
&gt; PO didnt know if the engine was replaced or not....
&gt;
&gt; GE              1979           2000 (California only, Vanagon heads)
&gt;
&gt; and then found this
&gt; GE      51 Kw   70 Hp   1970 cc 2       08/'75&gt;04/'79
&gt;
&gt; which doesnt say california next to it.
&gt; But acroding to muir's it seems to be a AUG 78 engine
&gt; but there is a extra 0 in after the GE in muirs book so I am
&gt; not certain thats right.
&gt;
&gt; So what I am trying to figure out now is what is the CORRECT timing.
&gt; Do I time it as 7.5o BTDC or 5 ATDC for california???
&gt; Or time it as a 78 engine acording to muir's which is 7.5o BTDC
