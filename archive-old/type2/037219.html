         looking  for some advice  on how you guys strip paint and
bondo down
to the metal. I tried some chemical stripper I had around and it
didn't do
much......

Mike:  What kind of paint stripper are you using??

I am not aware of ANY hardware store products that would do a good job
for you.  That applies also to primers and paints after you get the
vehicle stripped.  I recommend you check yellow pages for autobody
supply houses and be sure you are using the right products for what
you are trying to do.  The friendly hardware man is not your friend in
this case.  My 2¢ worth......
