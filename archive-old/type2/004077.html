Subject: [T2] Re:Re::[T2] URGENT SOS

Paul A ( and anyone else who missed the post )-
Following is a repeat of the original post  regarding
Mr and Mrs. Dave Luppy, who requested A.I.R.S.
assistance when their 74 Bus broke down this
week while on their honeymoon, traveling from
Manhattan and heading to St. Louis and Seattle.
Anyone who would like to contact them may
e-mail off-list for additional info.
Dave \X/ , A.I.R.S.

&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Dave Luppy are on their way.
&gt;They were towed to a second garage, one
&gt;that actually works on Bolts, and had the
&gt;broken halfshaft removed and brought it to
&gt;me for examination. We found the new inner cv
&gt;had come apart, and the cage was cracked
&gt;but not broken. The problem was the cv joint
&gt;had virtually no articulation, like as if it were
&gt;incorrectly assembled, but the fact is it is a
&gt;poor quality aftermarket part. it had also slightly
&gt;damaged the end of the shaft when the balls
&gt;dropped out, and the inner race was damaged.
&gt;We rejected the failed part and he is replacing
&gt;both halfshafts with good used, cleaned, greased,
&gt;original Lobro halfshafts, and should be good for
&gt;another million miles.He will be installing them
&gt;himself tomorrow morning.
&gt;Mrs. Luppy has examined her prenuptial agreement
&gt;and acknowledges that the party of the first part has
&gt;used up a significant portion of allowable roadside
&gt;repair time, but took the afternoon in stride, and was
&gt;quite interested in discussions of project vehicles and
&gt;technical ramblings.
&gt;They are heading for St. Louis and Seattle.
&gt;Happy Honeymoon, Dave and Dasha.
