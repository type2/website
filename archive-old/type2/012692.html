Subject: FS: 75 transporter 
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I've got a 1975 Orange and white Transporter for Sale.
Interior is minimal (kinda set up as cargo van) just driver and passenger
seat.  Body is in excellent condition.  Engine leaking a bit of oil, and
probably could use a fuel injection tune up.  It runs strong, never had a
problem with it not getting me to where I want to go. 

$1200.00
