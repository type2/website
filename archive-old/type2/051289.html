Subject: [T2] RE: Westy Sun Visors

I remember that my '71 Westy had a visor on the passenger side that was
permanently attached at the inside (by the mirror) but I've since found that
not all Busses came that way.  

If your problem relates to the outer pivot, there is probably only 1 correct
way to screw them in and if you get the pivot mount upside down (180 degrees
off) the pivot angle will run you into the roof.

&gt; Greetings -
&gt; 
&gt; I can't get my sun visors to swing out to cover the side windows. The wood
&gt; ceiling paneling appears to be hampering it.
&gt; 
&gt; Are there work-arounds to this? Different hinges?
