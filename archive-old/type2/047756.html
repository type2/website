&gt; I run them on my 89 Vanagon and they've been good
&gt; for
&gt; me.  No complaints.

&gt; &gt; Hi All:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the risk of another tire thread, I have to ask
&gt; &gt; this question. Does anyone
&gt; &gt; have experience with Costco's Kirkland tires on
&gt; &gt; their bus? I recently
&gt; &gt; purchased a set of their LT195/75R14 Load Range C
&gt; &gt; tires for my 71 Westy and
&gt; &gt; they seem to make the vehicle terribly unstable,
&gt; &gt; much more so than the
&gt; &gt; passenger car tires that were in use before. The
&gt; &gt; wind sway is far worse and
&gt; &gt; makes it very hard to control the bus. Nothing
&gt; else
&gt; &gt; has changed on the bus
&gt; &gt; and I'm running proper pressures (40/45
&gt; front/rear),
&gt; &gt; KYB shocks, good
&gt; &gt; steering system, etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I couldn't find any specific info in the Archives
&gt; or
&gt; &gt; Tire FAQ so if anyone
&gt; &gt; has direct experience with these tires I'd be
&gt; &gt; appreciate it being passed
&gt; &gt; along. These are a two-ply sidewall tire and I'm
&gt; &gt; especially curious to see
&gt; &gt; how they compare to the Yokohama Y-356, which I
&gt; &gt; believe is also a two-ply
&gt; &gt; sidewall.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Many thanks.
