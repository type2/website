Subject: Electrical mystery solved

so it was the negative power cable all along...I had tested it before everythign went dead...today i tested it after trying to start the van and it read 0 when testing between the body and the + terminal...$4 and 5 minutes later the van was up and running...the bad spot was hiding behind the FI wiring...the exposed wires were about 80% corroded
 
Many many thanks to everyone that helped me...i feel like a putz now seeing as how just about everybody suggested changing the cables...the parts of the cable I could see were shiny so I had though it brand new...oh well...that;s what I get for thinking...
 
Thanks again,
Colby
