Subject: FS: 78 Westy 

The wife and I need some cash so we are letting go of our bus.

1978 Campmobile.  3K on new motor.  Needs Body work.  Has: new motor,
starter, breaks, VDO oil temp and oil pressure, and quite a few other
things.  Have maintained her really well and looking for someone to do
the same.  As said it is a westy so has sink, stove, fridge, sleeps 4,
and has child's cot.  Runs Fantastic.  Ready for daily use and camping.
