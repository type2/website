Subject: How to put 009 dist. into 2.0l pancake...

OK, I've heard about the pros and cons of putting a 009 distributor into 
my '77 camper, but I thought installing it would be easy.....not.

I've observed that the &quot;dog gear&quot; at the bottom of the 009 distributor has a 
different orientation relative to the rotor compared to my 005: and it's 
not off by a convenient 90 degrees either. 

Here's the scenario:

I turn the engine to TDC for Cyl #1 and remove the original distributor. 
The top of the distributor drive shaft is oriented as it should be 
(according to the service manual).

Now, if I installl the 009, the rotor does not point to the crack on the 
side of the distributor casing where number 1 should fire. In fact it 
doesn't point to any post in the distributor cap. Of course, I can rotate 
the distributor body so that it does line up, but then I don't think the 
points will be opening and closing at the right time.

What am I doing wrong? or do I have to re-align the distributor shaft 
gear such that the rotor points to the cyl. 1 post AND the points are open?

Something doesn't seem right...
