Subject: RE: [T2] Zinc - is it good ?

Some people Zinc plate Chain Maille. You know, as OLD style armor. I
make a little bit of it (yeah, I'm a geek. Heh heh) and I've thought of
coating. You basically just melt the stuff down and dip in your piece(s)
and shake 'em off. If your interested in something like that you could
probably just look up your local chapter of the SCA (basically mideavil
re-enactors, kinda) and find a good armorer who could probably dip it,
or otherwise coat it in reall zinc for you at a fair price. 

Just a thought
Chris

&gt; Now I am interested because I have just bought a front beam to use as 
&gt; a spare. It's cleans and has only minor surface rust (Austrailian 
&gt; import so left hand drive - hooray). I'm going to get it sand blasted 
&gt; and will then paint it so I'm looking at options.
