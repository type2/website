Hi Chris,

If you can lay your hands on the 66-69 T1 Bentley manual, you will find a
very thorough explanation with diagrams.

The short story is:

The volume screw changes the pre-mixed *amount* not the mixture ratio, for
idle and just above idle smoothness.  The idle and progression circuits are
the main players in minimal throttle valve opening positions.
When the throttle valve opens wide enough to create sufficient engine vacuum
to draw from the main circuit via the discharge arm, the idle circuit vacuum
is minimized.  You can take a mirror and a flashlight and see when the main
circuit starts to kick in as you open the throttle.  You can hear it as
well.

Sometimes an over-rich volume screw adjustment can partially accommodate an
accelerator pump problem (crap in the diaphragm chamber and/or plugging
injection pipe).  1/16 to 1/8 turn out from the fastest obtainable RPM is
usually better than the smog standard adjustment change to fastest RPM only.
Go slowly in no more than 1/8 turn increments and wait ten seconds between
tweaks.

What could be simpler? There is only one screw to adjust. The Bentley
says turn it clockwise till idle drops off and than turn it
counterclockwise until the motor reaches its highest obtainable idle.
Then adjust the idle screw on the arm to get it back to about 850 rpm.

Here is the question. What is the screw doing ? Is it allowing more
air to mix with fuel or more fuel to mix with air or is it increasing
a the volume of a predetermined air fuel mix to the idle circuit? To
put it another way, is turning the screw in one way or another
richening or leaning out the mixture? Also it this only  in effect at
idle or throughout the RPM range?


I adjusted mine per the Bentley and now I have a flat spot which was
not there before.

Thanks
