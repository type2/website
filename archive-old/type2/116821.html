Subject: vandalised door lock

I was at the beach the other day... upon returning to the van, someone had 
severely harmed the driver side lock mechanism.

It looks as if somebody took a screwdriver and dug the inside of the lock 
cylinder out from the handle.  I have no idea how they did it, but it's just 
horrible ...

How do I go about getting a new cylinder for the door?  What parts should I 
look for?  I'd probably get them from a donor bus.  And then how do I get 
the new cylinder to fit my old key?  Would it be a heck of a lot easier to 
just take a key and lock cylinder from a donor bus and have two different 
keys for the bus?

thanks,
- Ian Bridwell
