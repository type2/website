Steve,

Is the butterfly actually changing in the choke?  Is your stairstep coming
in full open?  Does it start if you hold the butterfly closed?

Do you have an oil temp gauge -- if you have a major air leak, then at cold
you aren't getting rich enough.  Another symptom would be overheating when
warmed up.

Check your intake manifolds, the boots near the end and all vac connections.
What type of distributor are you running (stock dual or did you switch to
009)?

Gaskets under carb, did you renew these when you did your last carb removal?
Gaskets under the manifolds where they meet the head?  (Metal ones can not
be re-used at all, they crush).

Still can't find it?  Do a compression check... what is the history of this
engine?  Are all 4 cylinders giving equal power (pull plug wires 1 at time).

Having trouble with my bus.
Need help......
Tried many things but to no avail.
Bus won't start unless I pour fuel into the top of the carb!!
so far:
Replaced fuel pump
Replaced plugs, leads, contacts, condenser, distributor cap, rotor arm...
Replaced auto choke

The problem is only evident on cold start.  Once used, the bus will start
all day, stopping for up to 6 hours.  After that...more fuel in the top of
the carb.  Outside temperatures here during the day vary from + 15 celcius
down to 0 celcius.  Nothing too outrageous.

Bus is a 1975 bay window, 1600cc no mods, Solex Pict 34 carb.
Anybody got any ideas?
