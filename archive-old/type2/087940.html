Subject: Re: [T2] RE: hole in tin??

Like I said my 1st reply:
That hole is in all 75 to 78 tin. It has a rubber plug in it. I have not seen
the hole in 79 tin.

&gt; &gt; &quot;Temp sensor II is screwed into the front of the left-hand cylinder head,

the
&gt; &gt; intake manifold of no 3 cylinder and no 3 spark plug hole.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; ah
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Unless you have a 75 1800 head, you will NOT have a sensor in that
position on
&gt; &gt; the head. That is why you see nothing under it.
&gt;
&gt; then what do you plug that hole with,  is it in all tin or do I happen to
&gt; have a 75 1800 piece of tin????
