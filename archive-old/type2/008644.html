Subject: RE: VW Learning Curve responses
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 1999 11:30:52 -0800

Happy Friday,          Thanks to all the folks who responded to me
concerning your VW &quot;beginnings&quot;.   I wasn't surprised to see reference to
the Muir Idiot book turn up in 100% of the responses.  So, I guess we've
all learned something from it, and some of us could surely add some
addendums to the text.
               Most of us just picked up a wrench and a manual, and with
the help from friends and family, started down that long road of fixin',
maintaining, restoring, and cherishing our VWs.  And it seems that the
more we learned how to fix and maintain them, the more we were also
willing to share that knowledge.  And nothing is quite as spectacular as
pulling that just-fixed bus out of the driveway!
             Another statistic is that none of the respondees has owned
just one VW.  Some currently own and maintain 6 or 7.  At least one
mentioned reading the Muir book cover to cover before going out and
buying his first VW.  Bentley, Haynes, and Chiltons were also used in
conjunction with the Idiot Book.
            Some of us have gone on to teach our children the finer
points of VW maintenance, creating 2nd generation bus/bug owners and
lovers.  A few of us were lucky enough to learn from someone in the VW
trade, and others plan to enter that trade as soon as things click
together.
            By the sounds of all the responses, this VW affliction isn't
going to go away anytime soon.  So, I guess to sum it up, we all
tinkered....some with books in hand....some with friends helping
out.....and all with a desire to learn how to do it right, and do it
ourselves......and now it just so happens that there is an enormous
collection of us willing to guide the next generation of bus lovers into
uncharted territory.  To quote Dave Martin &quot; I guess what it boils down
to is that we've learned how to fix our buses out of necessity, and at
the same time it has become a passion and a way of life for us&quot;.  So
thanks Al, Art, George,  Steve, Ken, Thom, Clara, Ron, Fred, David, Pete,
Joseph,Giff, Jim, Michael, Andy, etc. etc. etc.  Your knowledge, time,
and generosity are very much appreciated and sought after by the rest of
us to get us through this *VW Learning Curve*.                           
                                           

             TGIF and the sun is finally shining here in Oregon this
weekend!
