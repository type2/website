I'm interested in changing the engine on my 1973 bus which runs on a 1700
engine.  I need better gas milage and preformance but don't want anything I
can win an indy race with.
I wanted to inquire about &quot;beefing&quot; my engine up but fear the increase in heat
will ruin it.  What can I do with my original engine?  What kind of carbs
should I get?  Duel or single?  Any information would be great.
