&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to replace the burned out instrument panel lights.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I took out the screws holding in the black panel and the cover is
still
&gt; &gt; &gt; attached by the heater control knobs (the blue &amp; red knobs). How do
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; remove these to get to replace the instrument cluster lights?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; for the 70 (not sure about the 63) just pull the buggers real hard.

 NO!  You can't 'pull' the early bay levers off like you can on 76? and up.
 The later ones [2 red and 1 blue] are held in by friction. You have to
 disassemble the levers from the arms or remove the arms on the early ones
[2 red and 2 blue].
