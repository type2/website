-I would recommend a self-etching primer, especially in a roofing
application.  I would then insure it further by using a sealer.  If you
aren't comfortable doing the spraying yourself, take the materials you've
chosen to a body shop AFTER you do the prep-work.  There are some local
shops that will do this for you pretty cheaply.

&gt;1) What sandpaper type (number) should I use to get the rust down?
&gt;2) Can I get the rust down to where I need to with a hand (non-electric)
&gt;sanding block?

Try a 50-80-120 grit disc in a drill. the grit depends on how much rust
there is.

&gt;3) What would be a good primer/rust inhibitor to use on this area?
&gt;4) Would a primer/rust inhibitor from a spray can be a wise choice?

A couple of coats of Rustoleum rusty metal primer is the cheapest way out,
but primer is porous and must be top-coated, so do a couple coats of color.
