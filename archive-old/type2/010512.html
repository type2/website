&gt; I packed my CV joints with standard axle/bearing grease.  THEN, i
&gt; read the
&gt; manual about how much to use. 20-20 hindsight.
&gt; The grease i used was not black like the grease that was already in
&gt; the CVs
&gt; and i'm sure i used more than the manual specifies.
&gt; 
&gt; Am i gonna blow the boots out?  Is standard axle/bearing grease wrong
&gt; and if
&gt; so, why?

It's a matter of what the grease is asked to do.

Wheel bearings go round-and-round, so they need grease that works well
when flowing through a continuously moving interface between
ball/roller and race.

The balls in a CV joint reciprocate (move back and forth) in their
races, so they need grease that holds up well under this more severe
condition.  Usually molybdenum is added to regular grease to make it
suitable to such high-pressure applications.  That is why the grease
tends to be dark in color.

Now, will wheel bearing grease hold up under such conditions?  That's
hard to predict.  I doubt that the people who specified special grease
for the CVs did so lightly.  In addition, most CV kits come with their
own grease, another indication that this might be important.
