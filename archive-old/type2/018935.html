Do you have carpet installed? did you take the carpet over the &quot;lip&quot; where the
sliding door closes?  I did this :( and my door doesn't &quot;pop&quot; out anymore
either...I have to pull on the &quot;U&quot;

&gt; But the door doesn't
&gt; &quot;Pop&quot; out when pushing on doorhandle.  I am stumped.
