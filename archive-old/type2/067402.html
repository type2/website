Subject: Re: BUS CARPETS

I went down to Carpetland and picked up a 6' x 12' piece of tan berber
carpet for about 20 bucks. It was plenty for the back of the bus, with
enough left over (I think) to carpet the front floor if so desired (not
yet). It's not exactly stock, but I think it looks nice with the black
seats, red interior, and varnished wood panels. It's sort of a pain to cut,
though, as those loops aren't very well behaved. Sharp scissors are best
for this. Berber doesn't have to be bound at the edges, in my experience.
Also, carpet pad adhesive is great for gluing it down. It's basically
liquid rubber. it's water soluble when wet, and paint thinner soluble when
dry. I used it to glue the extra pieces of carpet to the inside of the bus
as heat/sound insulation (don't worry, it's _under_ the wood panels). I
didn't glue down the floor carpets though, as they fit well into a rather
constrained (square) space, and don't move around very much.

Good luck,

&gt;&gt;This weekend, I plan, I my grand scheme for putting my bus back
&gt;&gt;together, to MAKE MY OWN CARPETS....?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I fortunately have the original mats from the front of the bus, and have
&gt;&gt;cut out the board for the back - these I can use as templates for the
&gt;&gt;carpetting...my only concern here is whether the carpets will need to be
&gt;&gt;bound at the edges or not....I figure they shouldn't fray given that
&gt;&gt;they have rubber backs.
