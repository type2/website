Yes, any fastener place should have them.  I believe they are a standard
metric thread.

&gt;I'm trying to make a buck or two through my business, and not from this list.
&gt;I will only recover my costs by offering these seatbelts for only $150 to the
&gt;list.

Wow, I think you paid a lot for them then.

&gt;I'm not wanting to start a seatbelt war here.  I did post in my previous
&gt;message that the new Mexican seatbelts were &quot;use at your own risk&quot;  I just
&gt;wanted to point out that using used seatbelt from a Vanagon or other vehicle
&gt;is possibly a greater risk.

I don't think using either one is much of a risk, unless one is seriously
paranoid.  As long as the Vanagon belts aren't frayed or rotten they will
be fine.  The problem with this type of thing is when people try to attach
the belts using inadequate hardware or mounting points.  With the Vanagon
belts it's not much of a problem since you are re-using the same bolts and
mounting points that held in your old seat belts, and if you use 3/16&quot;
steel for the L bracket like I specified, that won't be a problem either.
New grade 8 bolts in the stock size should also be plenty strong.  I don't
buy the metal fatigue argument either - those bolts aren't going to fail
because you tugged hard on them once or twice.  They are over-engineered
for their job, but that's how the automakers do safety-related stuff.  

Bottom line, use whatever seat belts you want as long as they are in good
shape and you don't re-engineer the mounting points.  The Mexican belts may
be a little easier to install - I don't know.  A plus is that they are
brand new.  I just wanted to present a less expensive alternative that will
work fine as long as you use some common sense.

Now here's MY disclaimer:  Don't think you're going to hold me liable for
anything I've said in this post, which was for reference only and not
intended as a guide for the mechanically-challenged.  I did not command you
to put Vanagon seat belts in your bus.
