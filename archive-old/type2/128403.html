&gt; We recently brought our 63 DC back from
&gt; Carson City, NV to Aurora, CO.  After a look at some topographical maps etc,
&gt; we decided to take US40.  The main reason for this was that the top speed of
&gt; the DC was roughly 55mph to 60mph.

On second thought, belay that I-10/20 suggestion... I'm seconding Troy!
Having driven the Interstates out west at 55-60 I would definitely prefer
a road with a slower pace.  The &quot;freeway flyer&quot; trans will *allow* higher
speeds, but that does not improve the brakes or handling of a splittie!
45-55 is just *smarter* no matter what the power available.

BTW... speaking of handling...  and since Gord *will* have the cash...
make damn sure that bus is wearing load range C/D tires, eh?

OOK!
