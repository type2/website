excellent. It has a lot of items you can get elsewhere (for a little bit of
a cost savings), but you get comprehensive instructions and the convenience
of all of that stuff being in one box, instead of running all over town
getting all those little pieces (what's your time worth?). For me, the time
is worth more than the $, so the kit is a great way to go. It's not the way
to go for guys with more time than money.

Also, it must be pointed out that the results ARE dependent on the time and
attention YOU put into the restoration of your wheel. Buying this kit is not
a guarantee that you will have great results, it just makes it easy to get
the results you want IF you put the time and attention into it!
