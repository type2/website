Subject: Re: [T2] Body Work $$$

I've heard that shops will quote a price so high ( double) knowing that the  
customer will go else where if they do not want to do the job.  If by  chance 
the customer is willing to pay then the shop can fumble thru if they have  
little knowledge of the task.  I'm sure a lot of shops don't want to work  on 30+ 
year old vehicle.
 
For $1900 i think you should be able to have all the door and window  rubbers 
replaced.
