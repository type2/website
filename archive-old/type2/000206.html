Has anyone got any DEEP experience with taking a bus into the FAR northern
polar circle......Lapland, in particular.
I don't expect anyone to have specific info.....but anything relating to
major LOW temperatures would be appreciated.
It's a '71 Dormobile that exudes honey instead of CO2 she's so sweet....
Heat exchangers connected..gooseneck heater fitted to keep engine from dying
in severe cold....but do I need to bathe the engine in the water for my
coffee before starting ????
....Alaskan replys appreciated.
