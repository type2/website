Subject: Re: [T2] major engine teardown woes

Uhhh, I can't help you with &quot;just what will get me 100 miles down the road&quot;
repair suggestions. Perhaps you could call the toll free number at
www.gexi_dot_com and ask them as they seem to have made an entire business of
selling VW engines repaired in this fashion.

To do things properly. I would, at the very least, spring for a new set of
cylinders/pistons.rings and a pair of rebuilt heads. Mainly because, it's
such a pain in the a** to pull and rebuild an engine and reinstall it... why
risk having to re-do the whole thing over again by scrimping on parts?

Check out Bus Depot www.busdepot_dot_com for rebuilt heads and
piston/cylinder/ring sets.
