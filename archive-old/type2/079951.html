Subject: Strange Heater

Hi, 
   In my new 74 westy I found a strange heater under
the ear seat. There is rectangular hole cut in middle
of the long front board for the rear seat that a vent
about 8 in by 3 in. I suspect this thing works pretty
good because the vent is somewhat melted.It has two
pretty big hoses coming off of it. Someone already cut
the hoses so I don't know where they came from or go
to. I can insert my pinky finger into the hoses. There
is also several electrical push on connecters: from
left to right Red-Yellow-Pink---White. From the red
and yellow connectors the are wires that go to a motor
that drives a fan. There is sticker on top that says
VW      0000
867 819 005 G
12V      R700
AEG      L59A25 88359
Made in Western Germany

Does any body know if this is a factory Item on a 74
or if somebady rigged it. Is it a plain old gas
heater? I don't think it is because there are stockers
and moldings with the vw symbol on it. If anybody
knows about this how do I turn it on if I reconect the
hoses, Assuming they are gaslines, although they are
much bigger than the hoses on the gas heater on my
411.
By the way, the dimensions are approx 12in. x 14in x
8in.Any info would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Tyler
