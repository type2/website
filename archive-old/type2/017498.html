Rubber bands are usually considered spare parts, not tools! ;)

In fact, I still have an &quot;engine rebuild kit&quot; for &quot;most models&quot; that I
bought at the local VW dealership in '82. It consists of one
blister-packed rubber band. It's a large rubber band, but I suspect it's
only for Type1 engines, because I think Type4 used a steel clock spring!
:)

Paul Doubek 
&gt; says the best tool for a VW owner is a couple of extra rubber bands incase
&gt; the motor breaks.  I told him we just use those to keep the curtains
