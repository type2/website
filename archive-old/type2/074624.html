&gt; Just joined the list...

welcome

&gt; Camper the whole way.  When I arrived I found I couldn't register my vehicle
&gt; because the Canadian model wasn't up to US spec (duh) in 1978.  Since then
&gt; it's largely sat in my driveway and with only 58,000km on the clock it's
&gt; breaking my heart so I've decided to get it &quot;roadworthy&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway after dealing with VW America and US customs I finally determined
&gt; that I need the following done before I can register my bus:
&gt; 
&gt; - brake failure warning lamp too small (I guess the red dot with the B on
&gt; the dash)

the US one is larger and is just pushed into a hole in the dashboard.  I
am sure folks on the list have em lying around.  probably have a few
myself (somewhere)   I would look at a US bus and see about where it is,
drill a hole in the dash, push fit it in and wire it up to the light that
is there.

&gt; - speedo in miles not kilometers
&gt; 
&gt; Where are good places to get one of these?  Has any had an experience
&gt; swapping out a speedo?  I mean, what do you do about the odometer reading
&gt; legally?

I would get some dry transfer lettering, open the top of the speedo, and
after doing the math for the conversion put the lettering for MPH on the
dial.  

don't tell em that the odometer is KmPH

&gt; 
&gt; I would like to get a new canvas for the pop-tent and I'm also looking for a
&gt; new gas tank because there is too much rust in the old one and clogs the
&gt; fuel line occasionally.  This happened because my father (previous owner),
&gt; let it still with half a tank of gas (no stabilizer) from 1982-1989.

these are straight forward and are covered in the library and archives

??? the MPH/KmPH thing confuses me, if it is clearly labeled in km and
there is no deception the Metric system is &quot;technically&quot; the only legal
system in the USA.
   Truely, there was a law some years ago legalizing the use of metric,
the conventional system is just there from inertia and has never been
formally recognized or legalized..
(ok so I have a friend in the Bureua of weights and measures)
