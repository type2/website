Subject: cleaning gasoline tank

so you bus sat for ten years and the full tank of gasoline turned
into
a coating of yucky black stinky varnish.

I a sure glade you are aware of the gasoline-varnish in your tank.

You must clean the tank (and fuel lines) completely or else you
will ruin your engine. The varnish does not burn well and it is
very sticky. It coats the cylinder walls and the rings cannot
scrape it off and the cylinders get scored and the rings break and
the rings break the lands off the pistons. The worst damage comes
from the intake valves getting stuck in their valve guides. The
gasoline-varnish fuel vapor coats the intake valves where the
valves slide back and forth inside their valve guides. The coating
turns to solid black glue.  The valves stick open because the
pushrods can force the valves open, but the valve springs are not
strong enough to pull the valves shut. Then the valves are hanging
down into the combustion chamber the the pistons come up and bang
into them. This ususally breaks the head. The pushrods can also
get bent if the valves get stuck closed.

THE ONLY WAY TO CLEAN THE TANK IS TO TAKE IT OUT.

You cannot just put in some chemicals and hope it comes clean. You
may get clean smelling gas to come out after lots of rinses, but
if you leave even the tiniest thin film of varnish, that varnish
will dissolve into your gasoline and ruin the engine.

Unless you have a surgical medical type laparoscope or endoscope,
you cannot see into the tank to see if it is clean. You can cut a
hole into the gas tank compartment on the deck just behind the
back seat. You can then remove the gasoline level fuel tank sender
and look into the tank. But it is best to look into the tank from
the filler neck at the tank opening. You cannot see into the tank
from the fill opening at the fuel cap.

Besides, if the tank had gas sitting for years, you MUST replace
all the fuel lines anyway, including all the connections behind
the gas tank cover. You must remove the engine. Take off the cover
and replace all the connections.

I had the same problem. I took out my tank and used some chemicals
and my concrete mixer to clean it. I put in a couple of gallons of
water. I put in a box of powder type automatic dishwasher
detergent. This is mostly tri-sodium-phosphate (TSP) . I put in a
whole can of drain cleaner. This is pure lye (NaOH). DO NOT USE
DRAINO THAT HAS LYE PLUS ALUMINUM PIECES.
The aluminum in the lye
is added to make heat and melt the grease in the drain. This also
makes a bunch of gas bubbles. The lye gets wasted reacting with
the aluminum. You just want pure lye. The lye and the TSP &quot;eat&quot;
the varnish and turn it into water soluble soap. I also added a
couple of cups of sharp gravel and a couple of cups of sand. I
sealed all the openings with bent over hoses and pieces of old
inner tubes clamped on with hose clamps. I put the gas tank in my
concrete mixer and tied it in. I also used a couple of pumped up
inner tubes to help hold the tank in place. Then I ran the
concrete mixer for a couple of hours. The tank turned and turned
and turned and the sand and gravel scoured the tank clean and the
chemicals &quot;ate&quot; the varnish and turned it into soapy water. I then
rinsed the tank well and it was beautiful inside.

Some list members suggest that you coat the tank with a special
paint call POR. The POR is not suppossed to be able to be
dissolved by gasoline. I just left the tank shinny clean and
poured in some oil and diesel and sloshed it around to coat the
tank to keep it from rusting until I got the bus running.

NEVER NEVER USE ANY ACID TO CLEAN THE TANK

the acid will eat the iron in the steal tank

the TSP and the LYE are opposites of acids, they are
called &quot;bases&quot; the bases will not hurt the tank at all,
but they will eat away your skin and turn it into soap

good luck..

I can send you some pictures if you want.
