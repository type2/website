Subject: Bernie Bergman Hydraulic Special

I am getting ready to split the case to build a new bottom end
for the '71 Bus, (possibly the '72 fastback, whichever needs
it first, both are begging...) and am considering the 
Bernie Bergman $219 special that I see in the 'Dumb Blonds
and Hyped VWs' rag.

If you are not familiar with it, heres the poop: Clean, line
bore (DOnt start with this thread, please.), case savers,
deep stud, machine in lifters and a bunch of new oil galleys,
special cam, pushrods, springs, lifters, open for 90.5 pistons,
full flow machining, and some other stuff. Total of about $250
for the extra work (90.5s, full flow) I will be asking around
about the costs locally, but I expect them to be high, everything
is expensive in the Metro DC area.

I am also waffling on 'needing' the hydraulic lifters. I have never
had a lifter fail from the solid style, and have never noticed a problem,
and I am not adverse to setting the gap 3-4 times a year with the oil
change. 

Do I really buy more reliability? Better running at all temp. ranges?
Quieter? Is it more persnickity about oil? I figure it is prob.
about a $100 up-charge over the normal case cleaning and machining, 
so, bottom line, is it worth it?

25 years with solid lifters, do I REALLY need them now?

Thanx.

BTW, I have spent the last two weekends in serious contemplation
on the '72 Fastback project, and I am getting sick of finding
rust. I want to cut out each and every little rust flake
and put in new metal, but that might just be impossible. I have
to start something positive soon, I feel myself slipping
into despair. Do I pull everything and start sandblasting?
