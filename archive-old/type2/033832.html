Perhaps in the volkswagen community a new e-business model has come to the
fore?

(the following is hypothetical, no description of actual businesses 
is expresed or implied)&gt;&gt;

Anytime you send money to someone you don't know you take a risk.  How much 
are you willing to risk is up to you.

I hope that PLF is just a little behind in their orders and will catch up 
soon.  I think that Todd Hill is long gone, and may never be heard from again.

Since as H Steve Dolan. put it, &quot; *MOST* small businesses fail.&quot;, the reality 
is, that even though there are customers left out in the cold, the small 
business owner is likely in far worse shape when the business closes.  They 
may have borrowed money that they still have to pay back, and even with good 
intentions, paying back customers may be out of the question.

I don't think that in either case here the businesses were started with 
deception in mind.  

I started EuroCampers 3 years ago.  I started with a couple of group 
purchases, taking the deposits and placing the orders.  It was a lot of work, 
and there were people who sent me their money in the hope that I would follow 
through.  I no longer take deposits or money in advance.  I will take a 
credit card number, but I don't charge the card until the item ships.  

As much as I dislike credit cards, they offer protection to the customers, 
who have a recourse where a check or money order offer them very little.  
Never risk more than you are willing to loose when you send a check to 
someone who is a long distance from you, even if they have a good reputation.

If there is anyone out there still looking for Todd Hill, I hear that someone 
on the Vanagon list knows his whereabouts.
