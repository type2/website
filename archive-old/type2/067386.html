&gt; FWIW the &quot;official&quot; camper converter of VW's  spell's it 
&gt; &quot;Westfalia&quot; and I am _reasonably_ sure that the state in 
&gt; Germany is spelt the same way.

The company making the Westfalia conversions is officially called:
                        Westfalia-Werke
                        Franz Knoebel &amp; Soehne KG
located in the city of  Wiedenbrueck, Germany

The state in which this town is located in is called Nordrhein Westfalen,
which is one of the northwestern states in Germany with a border to the
Netherlands. So there is no &quot;ph&quot; anywhere....... :)
