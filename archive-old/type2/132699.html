Thread-Topic: [T2] Dual Port - What does that mean?

Subject: RE: [T2] Dual Port - What does that mean?

Some argue that the single port induces more turbulence at low RPM, thus
giving a more mixed fuel air mixture. The result supposedly is more
power at low rpm when compared to a dual port. Since we need all the low
end power we can get in our buses, you'll see some people prefer to
single port to the dual port head. I think the single port has more
metal in the head and is less susceptible to cracking. Somebody correct
me if I'm wrong.

Basically, this provides for less restriction it the
airflow between the carb and intake valves, providing more power at
higher
RPM's.
