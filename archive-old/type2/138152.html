&gt; Even though I don't use my tools as often as say Mark Dearing there is 
&gt; something about owning a good quality set of tools that appeals to me

Hello Hot Dog  How ya doing well I hope give karen a big kiss and tell her 
its from me  :)   There is nothing worse than tring to do a job and the damn 
tool breaks , That is why I use Snap-on tools  I can call the guy and get it 
replaced right away  The trouble with craftsman is that you have to go to sears 
and hope that they have a replacement tool in stock which as Murphy would have 
it they dont LOL     Another subject  I just got thur reading Jimmy Buffets new 
book  A salty piece of land    very good  if you dont already have it I'll 
bring it with me to Paddys wagen and let you borrow it   later and have fun
