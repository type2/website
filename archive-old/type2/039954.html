Subject: Re:Hail

We get some pretty good hail storms here in Wichita too!  In 93 we had
one that pretty well took out every business window on the west side of
town.  I had my wife's car on the east side and had  no idea it had even
hailed until I saw all the destruction.  My wife had gotten frightened
and had a friend come over to get her and our children from our apt and
take them to their house with the basement.  Andy showed up to get them
right as it started. He was driving a brand new GM sedan.  When I saw
it,  it looked like someone had just peppered it with ball peen hammers
of various sizes.  The funny thing was he was parked right next to my 70
AMC Hornet  which skated by unscathed.   Now that  I have the Westy,
every time it looks like it might hail,  it goes into the garage.
Sometimes when it  looks like it might hail, we pull the paid for ,
fully insured, ten year old Mitsubishi 4X4 into the driveway and just
hope!
