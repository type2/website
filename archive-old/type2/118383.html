Subject: Re: [T2] engine fire sermon

This sounds like a good method. The only comment I'd like to add is it is
good to pull the steel line out and have a good look at it. I had read all
about the steel being hacksawed by the tin, and was well aware of it. Last
summer I finally pulled it out and got a big shock, when I saw it was almost
sawed through on both sides. This is a scary weak point of our beloved VW's.
Have a good look at that steel line.

&lt; The nice thing about my method is that it can be applied without removing
any fuel lines or hoses.
