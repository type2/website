Subject: RE: Dead Stickers = Probable Cause ?!?

I broke down in my '72 on I-95 in Virginia a few years ago.  A state
trooper pulled up behind me after only a few minutes.  My aftermarket
electric fuel pump have given out so he radioed for a tow truck.

While we were waiting for the tow truck, the trouble started.  &quot;Did you
put those stickers on this vehicle?&quot; (duh!), &quot;Where are you headed?&quot;,
&quot;Where are you from?&quot;.

I answered all of his questions politely, including his last question:
&quot;May I search your vehicle.&quot;  My answer was NO, of course - and he left
us alone.

Perhaps he could have searched us if he had really wanted to but I
suspect that stickers are NOT probable cause (at least in VA).  Maybe
things would have been different if he had pulled me over for speeding
or something instead of happening upon a disabled vehicle.

Needless to say, I have fewer stickers now.  :-(

 &gt; Strange, non-mechanical thread, but I'll put my two cents in....
In the Commonwealth of Virginia, upon stopping a vehicle, a cop/trooper can 
ask to search your car.  If you let him, anything found is admissable ( a 
good lawyer might be able to fudge that one, though )   If you refuse, he 
will tell you &quot; I can have another car here in 5 minutes and we'll search 
anyway...bla bla bla &quot;
Well, truth is, he cannot search without reasonable suspicion or a warrant 
that describes specifically what he's looking for and where he hopes to find 
it. ( Sees bags of pot, or unclothed underage girls, etc. )

   While having a Dead sticker might be cause to check you out or pull you 
over,   it is not enough to search your car.  Once in your car, he/she 
cannot search/open a closed or locked container/suitcase;   again, without 
your permission.    Now, if you've got bald tires, lights broken out, etc. 
 they could impound your car and search it anyway, but I'm not sure about 
admissibility in court of any evidence seized at that point.   According to 
my Fairfax County Officer/friend from high school,  a long haired hippie 
freak driving a bus might get pulled over for a quick check, but unless 
something is seriously amiss,  that is generally all that happens.  ( no 
quick moves my barber avoiding friends )       Drive safe in the Old 
Dominion!
