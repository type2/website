Subject: Greasing front beam

Hi Volks,
Couldn't find an answer to this in the archives so here goes.  Can
anyone tell me how much grease the front beam takes in total.  I haven't
greased it before and I don't want to (a) buy too little and have to go
back to the shop half way through or (b) buy too much and have it
sitting around for a year.
Thanks in advance for any help.
