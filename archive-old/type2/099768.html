&gt;OK, this is what I've learned so far and it will be my first electrical project for the bus:

&gt;- run two separate wires from the starter to the relays.

Why two separate wires?  Just one should be sufficient.

&gt;What gauge of wire?

I would go with 10 gauge for this application.

&gt;- fuse the lines separately

Definitely fuse the line separately.

&gt;What style or fuse and what rating?

That's up to you.  You can get DC circuit breakers at West Marine but they are not cheap (~$35).  You could also use a fuseable link, available at Pep Boys.  I would look for something in the 30-50 amp range.

&gt;Lastly, who sells the relays I should be using and what are they rated at?

There are lots of cheap relays out there.  You can get standard 30-40 amp relays at Autozone for a few bucks each.  They are the small black cube ones.  Dunno if you would need two or only one - you should check the current draw on the lights to be sure.
