The splits were never intended to do interstate speeds.  These days they
are totally impractical &quot;daily drivers&quot; in pretty nearly every environment
I can think of.  On the interstates, they are too slow.  In town they are
too easily damaged.  If I owned your bus, I would use it as the &quot;antique&quot;
it truly is and only drive it to local shows to knock the socks off other
VWer's.

hey, what do you mean splitties arent functional transport.     i CAN drive
55.      i drove my 61 to alberta and back,  thank you.   I took my old 59 on
Dead tour,   from Ca to the east coast and various places in between.   It
was my daily driver for three years.   i like to drive a split screen bus.
   ieven put around town in the 54, when it isn't raining.  (needs paint- it
all baked off the roof)

but i agree that if you dont mind the speed (too slow? too bad!), it's better
to get something designed to go faster.
