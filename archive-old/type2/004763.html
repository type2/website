&gt; Nope, welcome to the world of 71s.  Rear bumpers are my personal
&gt; holy grail. you can't believe how hard good ones are to find.


I have brand new rear bumpers available that are quite close to those used
originally on '71s, for just over $100 new.  The difference is that they
have bumper brackets spot-welded to the inside of them, whereas a ;71 rear
bumper merely has holes there for the bumper mount. So you have to cut or
grind off the brackets and drill holes for the mount, not an unreasonable
project in exchange for having a new rear '71 bumper for about a hundred
bucks.

I also have &quot;repro&quot; front '71 bumpers available for $299.  These are
fiberglass not metal, come in black but can be repainted, and match the
shape/design of the original.  Mats for the step areas are included.  The
front bumper guards are actually molded right into the design, so they are
included but are not removeable as on the original metal bumper.  It is a
nice repro, if not metal as the original.
