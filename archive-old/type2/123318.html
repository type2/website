Subject: Re: [T2] Diagnosis...Murder!!! 

Laura,

Rattling noise is not too descriptive&lt;grin&gt;, but here we go!

Compression check would be good to start with....mostly
because you get to see what the spark plugs look like and *then*
try the compression test.

Also pull the valve covers off and see what the valve train looks like...
got a valve so far off from the others that jumps out at you?

Broken valve spring?

Good luck, dave

&gt; Does anyone know the order of diagnosing an engine problem.
&gt; I've a 79 Westy FI automatic.
&gt; I tried taking it up to Yosemite. It was a hot day. I was downshifting on the 
&gt; hills. Lots of stress on the trans. and the engine.
&gt; Something broke.
&gt; There is a rattling noise when the engine turns over, and it does not start.
&gt; Would it help to do a compression check?
&gt; What steps does one take to diagnose....Murder!!!!
&gt; I killed my bus!
