Talking about VW gas tanks, new from a mail order
dealer:
 It was a bit tacky on the outside 
and somewhat 
smudgeable, and tackier and wetter (almost like
petroleum 
jelly) and makes 
your fingertip black when you probe around inside the 
filler hole.

+++++++++++
I was just reading a RMMW catalog last night, and
noticed that they say that the new gas tanks that they
sell need to be cleaned out before use.  I think they
recommended the same stuff you use to clean out an old
tank before using a sealer inside it.
So perhaps this is considered &quot;normal&quot;.
