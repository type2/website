Subject: Re: [T2] howdy, and some questions

So how big of a press do I need for the
&gt; CV joints and what would be good for other bus projects
&gt; also, multiple uses I'm hoping :)

Having wrecked out about five 80-83 Vanagons and driving my own Westfalia
for seven years I can without question say that every CV joint I've
removed required persuasion to get it off the half shaft.

You can beat your brains out on these things or just take them to an
Automotive Parts store that offers press services and they'll press off /
on or remove and install your new CVs for about $20.00 labor charge for
the set.

It would be a rare exception that the CV would come off with small press
action. If these CV had any slop at all they would slide laterally on the
shaft and soon develop a slight clunk. The CV should stay firmly seated
against the clip. I've found clips floating loose or disintegrated in CV
joints with broken bearing cages so I know that once the clip comes loose
you CV joint is not long for this world.

Servicing the CVs at 30,000 mile intervals and keeping good sealed boots
on them will give you well over 100,000 miles of service from your CVs.

I've bought and replaced several sets of CVs and most of the failures
resulted from poor lubrication, cracked / split boots that allowed grit
and water into the joint.

There may have been some design and tolerance changes between the 1998
year and earlier models but I'm a man with a big hammer, big vise and I
just have them pressed at a local shop. Emergency room visits are in the
$600.00 range just to get a seat to wait for a Doctor.

Wouldn't it be nice if everything worked the way Robert Bentley
envisioned it from his Downing street offices.
