  bustow a Geo   Metro?

Comparing the Roadcow towing a bus to a stock bus towing a bus (or Geo)
is like comparing The Rock (the muscular dude in the last Mummy movie)
to Don Knotts (or Dana Carvey for the young folks out there).  
Comparing calf to calf, the Roadcow has become a Bull!

&gt; Enough of the scare stories.  Britt Grannis (remember Britt?) has hauled
&gt; buses back and forth across the country using the Roadcow.  I don't know
&gt; if I'd recognize Roadcow without another bus hooked to the ass end. It
&gt; can be done. Just keep your thinking cap on and realize that you're
&gt; going to wear your bus out faster.
