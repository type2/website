Subject: Counter top/lids

Was written about counter lids**********************
better still, give us a manufacturer/part number and
the name/phone of the cabinet shop/distributor. If it
matches counter tops for 79's, doesn't that mean it
matches a lot of other furniture in a lot of other 
busses?
*****************************************************

The counter top lid I had made was a custom piece made
using the old lid as a template. This was a one of a
kind piece, but I probably could get a few others made
just like the first one. I did have to buy a full
sheet of the laminate and only used about half of the
sheet. I still have the leftover laminate for any
future touch ups.
If there is enough interest in any of this, I could go
and talk to the cabinet shop about making more tops
and maybe some of the other laminate pieces.
