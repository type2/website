Subject: Re: [T2] Busses By the Traxx

Busses by the Traxx was held this past weekend, not sure how many made
it but looked like a nice crowd, Sharon could not have ordered better
weather.  little foggy first thing in the morning but cleared nicely.

pot luck was one fantastic dish after another, with the big caldron of
Chicken Noodle soup to get everyone started...

missed the Canadians contingent though. hope everyone from up North is
ok and just decided not to chance the border guards.

photos I'm sure will be forthcoming.

thanks to all

Bob
