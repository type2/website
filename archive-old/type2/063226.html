John Siple&gt;  And you are right, many have moss and mildew growing 
John Siple&gt;  on them.  I thought moss grew on all VW vans.

John Siple&gt;  Settling in for 8 months of rain,

As a life-long resident of the various outskirts of Seattle, I must take 
issue with Mr. Siple's Euro-chic 9mm fantasies.  Seattle is in fact a 45 
caliber zone--especially the streets of the University District at night, 
and the back stairway at the Public Market during the day.

As far as moss is concerned, it does grow on all VW vans.  Those 
clever German engineers inoculated all busses with mold spores.  This 
was designed to protect fine vintage paint jobs from the ravages of the 
sun, on the few occasions when it is visible.

Perhaps the city gets ONLY 8 months of rain, but a short half hour 
drive (one hour between 4AM and 9PM) brings you to the foothills of 
the Cascades.  Here we get 50 - 80 inches per year (or is that per 
month?).  The transplanted Californians here can be seen everywhere 
pouting in their BMW/Mercedes/Lexus/Jaguars because they cannot 
ever open their sunroofs to stick their cell-phone antennas out for the 
rest of us to see.  The moisture makes them miserable.  They whine.  
Won't some of you kind California bus owners please drive up here, 
load up your busses with espresso-soaked, wanna-be-somebodies and 
return them to their native environment?

Staying over for the weekend (you could park in my driveway) should 
be sufficient to establish a healthy protective mold coating on YOUR bus, 
which you could maintain by daily watering when you return home.  
You could even freeze up your brake drums with rust!

Thanks for the bandwidth!
