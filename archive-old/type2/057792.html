&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I anyone on the list going to Burning Man next weekend in Nevada next
&gt; weekend?

&gt; I remember seeing somewhere that someone was
&gt; organizing a &quot;spiral of VW buses&quot;!!

It sounds like fun, but the concept of paying a promoter $100 (!) to
park on a dry lake in the Black Rock Desert is a bit too far out.  I
guess I'm just too mundane to get into the Burning Man spirit!
