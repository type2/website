Subject: [T2] Re: Murder Investigation

Well, this is a sad day indeed. I'm glad Charlie called to let me know
about Kristen's murder rather than finding out about it suddenly on the list.

Kristen called me around 11:30 on Thursday evening shortly before I posted
with questions about her carb. She stopped by around 7:00 or 7:30 and we
looked at her bus. We fixed a problem with the accelerator sticking by
adding another spring. 

I was prepared to take half a day off and help out if I needed to, but my
experience with 34pict3's hasn't been all that successful and I was pretty
confident she'd make it to California okay. Besides, she had a spare 30pict
and knew how to put it on. I gave her half the gasket material I still had
on loan from Ken and a razor blade to cut it with and I told her how to
mark it and cut it. I gave her a spare fuel pump just in case that went out
and some bananas from the counter and hot peppers from the garden.

While she was here she petted the kittens and was nice to my kids. She was
a decent person and it was easy to tell that.

Anyway, I just talked to a detective for about an hour. They're really
trying to solve this case and Kristen seemed like a nice person. Here's the
thing: her bus was a '71 yellow bus with a smaller-style top right in the
center. Not like the pre-68 westies, but about 1 1/2 times that size. If
any of you saw it, you would have noticed. Like I told the detective, there
probably aren't 10 buses like that in the country. I know there aren't that
many listees in these parts, but if you saw a yellow bus with a small top
on I-40 in Arkansas or Tennessee on Friday or Saturday, it was probably her. 

Also, she was at a rest area about 170 miles east of Memphis Thursday night
when she called me. While she was on the phone with me, she had a brief
encounter with someone in a truck, who she said almost ran over her dog.
There's likely no connection here, but just in case you saw her...

Anyway, if you know anything or if Kristen contacted you, please call
Detective Carl Bird or Officer Cleve Keeling at 501-354-2411.

Kristen gave me a hug as she was leaving. It's kinda sad to think that I
might have been the last decent person she met in this world. If you're
thinking for a minute that there's a problem with the AIRS list, just
remember that without that list, she wouldn't have even met me...nor I her.
There are, of course, a bunch of things I would do differently if I could
now, like beg her to crash here at the house...but I'm not about to blame
myself or the AIRS list or any other act of kindness. It was a cruel person
who did this...I hope they get caught.

Thanks! Joe
