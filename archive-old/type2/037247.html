Thanks John.  And thanks to all who have responded on my leaky engine 
question.  I agree with the many suggestions that the pushrod tube seals are 
leaking.  I've noticed oil droplets at the ends of the tubes.

The Bus goes in on Friday for seal replacement at a very experienced shop 
(around since 1952).  I'll let all know on the list if the flow is 
contained.

Regards,

&gt; &gt; Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot and search for the specific
&gt; &gt; location(s) of the leak?  Supposedly, the engine is a rebuilt unit
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; about 20k miles on it.  Is it possible to go to the spray wash and
&gt; &gt; clean off
&gt; &gt; the bottom of the engine without flooding things in the engine
&gt; &gt; compartment?

&gt;Hey there Walt,
&gt;
&gt;My 79 has a oil consumption problem. I went to the local spray wash
&gt;to clean up the bottom of the motor and it worked great. The bus
&gt;didn't have the engine seal around the tin (I've replaced it since
&gt;then), and the water wasn't an issue. I even power washed the top
&gt;portion of the engine too, but if you're trying to troubleshoot an
&gt;oil leak, you should have to do this.
&gt;
&gt;I used some spray on degreaser and a whole lot of quarters.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps,
&gt;
&gt;
