&gt; &gt; By the way, I've had 3 responses to my fuel capacity
&gt; &gt; question: 14.7,15.2 and
&gt; &gt; 15.8 - I think I'll
&gt; &gt; stick with 15.5!
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm. Not to add any more confusion, but I just
&gt; checked my '69s owner's manual....it says 15.9 US
&gt; gallons!!! ;-)

keep in mind that the lower number I quoted did not include a certain
amount of unusable fuel (1/2 gallon or so)  This is fuel below the level
of the tank outlet.  The purpose of this unusable fuel is to provide a
settling area for grunge and water where it won't be sucked up all at once
by the outlet.  It's a good idea to pull the in-tank filter when you
replace the fuel lines and allow the water/grunge out.  If you leave it
in, it can rust your tank!
