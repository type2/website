Hi all,

    I need some input.  My 82 aircooled westy will not pass DEQ.  All the
tuneup stuff has been done.  I took it to the shop I frequent when I can't
do it my self &amp; this is waht they told me.  The CO is 3% before &amp; after the
converter.  That obviously means the converter is bad.  The other thing is,
the mechanic had to back out the CO screw on the airbox all the way to get
it to 3%.  Here is my questions.  How much will the catalytic converter
lower the CO? Also, would you just get a CAT &amp; try DEQ before buying a new
AFM?  Thanks in advance for the help.
