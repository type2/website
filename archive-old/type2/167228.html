Subject: RE: [T2] Exhaust Gaskets

&gt; &gt; Pic here: http://www.donimages_dot_com/guacamolebus/photos/photo.php?id=32&gt; &gt;
The gasket on the left was from Autozone. The one on the right is from&gt; Vee
Dub Parts in Huntington Beach, CA. Neither came with manufacturer&gt;
information.&gt; &gt; The Autozone one is just some thin metal around a thick paper
gasket.&gt; The VeeDub one is layers of metal. So which is better?The one on the
right just looks better.  In my experience (I worked in a shop where we did
exhaust) the main thing is a good, flat non-leaky seal.  Leaks are what eat up
gaskets.  You could get some slightly smaller diameter tube and sleeve the
connection.  Almost a guarantee of a leak free seal.  Many leaks are from
manifolds that were designed to have a sleeved flange and prior work left it
out.JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62 404.1 Kompressor 2. 58 VW panel 3. 66 sedan
