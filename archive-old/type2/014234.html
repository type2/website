Subject: re: brake diagnosis



&gt; Hi George
&gt; A wheel cylinder may be leaking into the boot yet the leak may not yet be
&gt; apparent unless you actually pull the wheels and pry into the boots.  Same
&gt; applies to a master cylinder, except you don't have to pull the wheels.
&gt; How's the fluid level been?

No apparent fluid loss,  I wish there were, as it would make diagnosis a lot easier.  No fluid present inside the master cylinder boot.  
Bottom of all four backing plates are dry.  Considering that the free play after sitting accounts for at least a few ml of fluid, I'd expect to 
see evidence of leakage.  I haven't had a chance to look at it further, but bleeding the lines is the next step.  I suspect that the additional 
exercise of the master cylinder while bleeding will either cure it or kill it, probably kill.

George Lyle
