Subject: Re: [T2] Charcoal Filter Necessary?

Jason:
Maybe you could set up some little flare (flame) system whereby those gasoline
vapors would just burn at the rear of the bus. Sorta like they have those flare
flames at oil refineries? Get some good heat out of it in the winter time?
Just kidding of course. Just fix the damn hoses and make it work right. Don't
you think if it could have been made simpler VW would have made it so at the
factory and saved themselves the $20 times 300,000 per year? That $600,000 would
have made a nice Christmas bonus for a couple of bean counters!

69 double cab, still on its original carbon cannister, though I've replaced the
hoses.

&gt; Are you sure you want to go this route simply for the sake of eliminating a
&gt; couple of hoses?  And, for what it's worth, that E-Can should be replaced
&gt; every 40,000 miles.  Replacements are still available via your local VW
&gt; dealer.
