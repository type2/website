Sure did.

But Coleman said the unit will not operate at 30 Degree Incline. The
units you see that are mounted on a slope are special design to operate
on that fixed slope.

&gt; Did you consider mounting the roof unit at the rear of the poptop?

&gt; &gt; About a year ago I bought a Standard Coleman Mach III roof air 
&gt; unit to
&gt; &gt; add to my Westfalia.
&gt; &gt; I strapped it to the roof and couldn't make the Pop-up lift, too 
&gt; heavy.
