Subject: RE:Fan Housing Flaps Etc.

What if you have an aftermarket muffler and no crossover pipe?


    From: &quot;Karl&quot; It is the support bracket for the drivers side heater box 
at the rear. The pass box support is the alt
bracket.
On 75-78, #19 connects to the upper bolt of the joint between the crossover 
pipe and the U pipe, then the
other end bolts to the left end of the fan housing.
