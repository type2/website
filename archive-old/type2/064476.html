Yes, they seem high, but folks who don't do their own work on their buses 
(and I'm assuming that's the case here) can get stuck paying big time bucks.

I just ran across someone who was trying to sell their 1979 Coleman 
conversion camper for $9,500 CDN (that's about, what, a little under 
$7,000 US?) and it was okay, but noticeably rough in places.

Why was she trying to get such a high price, you ask?  Because she had put 

 ---&gt;  $15,288.64 of work into it over the last two years!  &lt;---

That doesn't include oil changes and tune-ups, kids.  Total mileage over 
the period?  A mere 32,592 miles.  16 thousand bucks.  Believe it--it 
ain't Friday here yet.  I got all the receipts and added 'em up myself.  

If you're thinking she was totally took by an unscrupulous mechanic, 
you're right.  As merely one example, how about $295.00 to diagnose a 
failed front axle beam--and that's just the labour charge!

Sadly, I suspect many people out there who rely heavily on someone else 
to do work on their cars are paying more than they should.  And even with 
a totally honest straight-arrow mechanic, you still have to pay for her 
or his time which runs around $60.00 an hour in these parts.  That adds 
up.  A major job can be several hundred bucks in labour alone.  For people 
used to evaluating repair costs based just on parts costs, mechanics' 
bills can seem outrageous.

Just my CDN$0.02 (that's about US$0.014)
