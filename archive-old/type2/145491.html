Subject: RE: [T2] Is my engine supposed to idle down over a period of
  about 15 seconds?

&lt;SNIP&gt;
I notice that when I come to a stoplight, my engine
will be idling at about 1200rpm

I had a perpetual high idle. turned out that my double
relay was not powering the aux air valve, so I just
had too much metered air to the engine. Broken aux air
valve would do the same things. Not sure that would
cause a temporary high idle in your case though.
