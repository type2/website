Subject: Master cylinder off, brake line advice?

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Thank you for the excellent advice on getting the master cylinder off.  Look out felix!

I want to (must) replace a brake line, the short one to the front driver side.  I don't
expect a prefitted part to be available (but is it?), so I assume the next step is 
getting some special tool for flanging the threaded thing onto the pipe.  Of course I'd
also like to replace the threaded thing (what's it called?) since it's rounded out, by
a previous attempt, and worsened by me.

The other lines look ok, but if it's special tool time, maybe it's time to do all the 
brake lines?  What am I about to experience, gurus?  I've dealt with VW wheel cylinders 
before, but this is my first master cylinder movie.  It's a double feature with brake 
lines.  Yippie!

Thanks,
James
