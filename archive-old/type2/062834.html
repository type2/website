Subject: Got a roof rack: what is it? 

        Bought a roof rack at a garage sale today: part # ZVW153114 Vendor
Code B-1

        What does this go to?  I'm thinking squareback: its &quot;flat&quot; and the
legs are not very deep.              
        
        This thing is a close to NOS as I'll ever get.  Old guy said he
never even used it.  Still has nice rubber in the feet and clamps.
