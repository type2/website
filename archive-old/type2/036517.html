Morgantown is a bit of a drive  but there is a Westy sitting on Loch
Raven Blvd near putty hill in Baltimore that has been sitting there for a
while with for sale sign on it.  it is a mid 70's Westy full interior,
looked at it yesterday seems to all be there and looks decent.  not sure
what year it is, but it has the newer larger tail lights but still has the
low front turn signal so it is probably 75 or so.

it is white, couldn't find a phone number but if you are interested I will
leave a note on it.
