&gt;And when all threads are
&gt;lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful torque
&gt;readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
&gt;truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.

Possibly not. Torque specs are generally intended for dry threads, and
slippery lubricants are fairly difficult ( i.e. impossible ) to spec for that.
Chances are you have more pressure than you would like on those wheels.
