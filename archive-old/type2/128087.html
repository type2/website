Hi Just got my72 Westy, unmolested, mostly OG paint,
straight as a pin (pics coming soon).
However, the poptop leaves something to be desired in
finish. 
I want to have it painted. What's this thing made of,
fiberglass?
So, should I take it to an auto place? boat place?
Anyone know the color name/code?

I need to have the bumpers painted as well (l-90
pastel white, right?) Should I have the same place do
it all at once?
Or, maybe a pop has a flat finish, the bumpers gloss?
OR are they both satin?

Thoughts?
Thx
Jason
