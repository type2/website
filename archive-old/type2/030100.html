Umm.  major pita.  and there are only a few select places you can do this.

&gt; 2) use a &quot;T&quot; at a dual oil pressure sender (for gauge and idiot light.)  no 
&gt; drilling required.

No.


You need the temp sensor to be somewhere where this is a /flow/ of oil.  A
dead-end oil passage such as that that the factory pressure sensor is in
is not a good location.

The sump is a good place, albiet a bit of a pita to get a wire too.

VDO makes a sump plate sensor that comes with specific instructions how to
install it in both an upright, and type4 sump plate.  Yes, it requires
drilling.  Any machine shop (automotive or otherwise) would probably let
you sweet talk them into drilling the required 9/16&quot; or 14mm hole. (or
spend the twenty or so bucks on the bit, if you have a drill press of your
own.  its a bear to do it with a 1/2&quot; handheld drill.:)
