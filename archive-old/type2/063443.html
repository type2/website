Subject: Re: oh my! not bosch filters too!

I have a 78 bus; if you get the VW dealer oil filter (looks like an Audi
part), you can suck and push air through it like it has no valve.. The Beck
Arnley version from local FLAPS has some sort of a valve.  Since the filter
sits at the bottom, I don't think it needs an antisiphon valve, and prefer
the free-flowing kind...any comments??
