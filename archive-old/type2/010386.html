My question is this: is there supposed to be a rubber grommet that fits
between the refill line and the two-pronged resevoir, or does the hose
plug directly into the resevoir? ('70 Westie)

	Dan,
	I think there IS supposed to be a gromet and I wasn't
able to find one from VW, RMMW, West Coast Metric, etc. I'll
check my parts book. I couldn't find the hose, top OR bottom
resivior or the seals for same for sale anywhere except junk yards
when I replaced the master cylinder on our '70 some years back.

	FYI, I cleaned the accumulated crud out of the original
two-prong resivior using jumbo-size pipe-cleaners sold at
the local hobby and craft shop. Took half a can of brake cleaner
and boy was I glad I had a mask!
