Subject: Re: [T2] 71 Westfalia Engine

Any of the 1600 engine cases will work if you are
willing to tap it for the moustache bar or run an
oil-pump/moustache bar adapter plate. However, what
I'd do is get a new case, almost all of which are
tapped for the moustache bar already. I just bought
one, myself, set me back around $350. Well worth it,
IMHO. 

Don't know diddly about remounting a Westy top,
though.

&gt; I recently bought a 1971 Westfalia camper. I know I
&gt; paid too much, but am going to try and restore
&gt; anyway. The guy I bought it from told me he would
&gt; come up with an engine case for me. He hasn't yet.
&gt; He had all the other parts. Mahle pistons. My
&gt; question is will any 1600 engine cases work or do I
&gt; have to have one for a bus? I believe I have
&gt; everything except for the rods and case. Also can
&gt; you tell me about mounting the camper back on. Does
&gt; it have nuts under the headliner? What about the
&gt; luggage rack mounting? I have the camper top and
&gt; luggage rack but they are just tied on. I live in
&gt; Broken Bow Oklahoma if anyone knows anyone close I
&gt; could hire to help me.
&gt; Thanks for any help.
