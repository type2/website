Hmmm- 80 ft lbs -  I gotta stand on the sliding handle to get off the
nuts sometimes- a lot must be too tight (of course there is friction
involved here- who greases their lug nuts)?  I don't stand on them to
tighten, but do give it an &quot;umphhh pull/push until I hear that &quot;creak&quot;. 
So a 16&quot; grab on a sliding handle needs at least 60 lbs of &quot;umphh&quot;
applied.  If you pull up that's like picking up a bag of cement- ok for
those with good backs- others, I'd say make sure you are setting to pull
down and even step on it if you only weigh 110 lbs!  I never let them
use  an air tool on installing rims BTW, I specify hand tightening and
check it myself.
