Subject: 71 Westy

Hi All,

I bought my 71 Westy from my nephew at his house
warming party. While he was giving me the tour of
the 5 acres, I spotted this bus that apparently
doubled as the jukebox for the nights festivities
outside. 

There was a bluegrass tape in the deck - it actually
came with the bus when he got it. I don't remember
the name of the band, but they were playing a humorous
tune called &quot;Ode to Billy Boner.&quot;

Since this was obviously divine intervention, my Westy 
has been known as Billy Boner or just Billy ever since.

This is the only &quot;thing&quot; that I own that I've attached
a name to.

Pete
