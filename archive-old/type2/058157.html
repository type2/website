Subject: Split Crew Cab search, $5500 budget
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

short and sweet...

I appreciate all the help that the listees have given me on my Crew Cab
search.  A recent bonus from work and realization of condition I'm
finding... has me raising the budget.  $5,500.  I'm pretty close to flying
down to San Jose this Friday to purchase one at that price.  (
http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/crew2/ ) Several have told me that I could do better
for that $, so I'd really appreciate if anyone has leads on nice body crew
cabs (1967 and earlier) on West Coast or Arizona.

The price on the ones that are really for sale is a lot higher than what
most people think!

Thanks.
