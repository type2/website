Charlie,
Get the VDO sender kit that consists of a metal plate that replaces the round
plate on the bottom of the engine case. It has a hole in it that the sender
screws into. this gives you sump temperature readings. This is the most reliable
and best looking installation available.

&gt;Are there different styles of VDO oil temp senders?
