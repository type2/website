Subject: Re: ba6 fit into 69 camper

&gt; Does anyone have any indication as to how well a BA6 gas heater fits
&gt; into a 69 camper?  Any personal experience or other information would
&gt; be appreciated.  TIA Ken, 82 westie on the road again.

Ken,

I've a BA6 installed in my '65 Deluxe.  No major modifications were 
needed.  Should be relatively easy with a '69.
