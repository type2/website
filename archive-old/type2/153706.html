Subject: Re: [T2] hot meat

Kevin said:


Hey guys.  I went to my favorite store for wanna-be chefs like  myself (Mia Cucina) and they didn't have
long-stemmed (11&quot;-12&quot;)   meat thermometers.  Can anyone advise where I might find  one.  I'm going to stop by
Chattanooga Restaurant Supply the next  time I'm down at Lockhart VW,  (practically neighbors)  but I  don't
think they have them either.

 Can anyone point me to an online source.  Or a brand/part  no.?  I'll trade shipping charges for sales tax
any day.   Thanks....KR

I wonder if a person can straighten the probe on this one?
