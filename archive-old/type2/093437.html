&gt;Hi everyone
&gt;I'm planning on moving to the coast and was wondering how this was going to
&gt;affect my 74 Westy.  What kind of changes am I going to have to make.  My
&gt;Westy has very little rust on it and is in very good shape so what do I do
&gt;to keep it that way?

Others may laugh, but............
Wash it in kerosene every once in a while.
