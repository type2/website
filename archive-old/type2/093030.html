Subject: RE: [T2] Why VW buses die


&gt;I have a Taurus with 150,000 miles on it.  The A/C needs a manifold hose,
&gt;about $500 w/labor. The wiper switch needs replacing; I have a alarm box that
&gt;has dangled down because the PO tried to tear it out of the car plus it is
&gt;very rusty.  So, I am in the market for a different vehicle myself. Which
&gt;brings me to the required type 2 content.  I would love to own a type 2, but
&gt;I have some reservations.  1.  I can only afford 1 vehicle so it would have
&gt;to be my daily driver.  2 not sure how it would go in the ice and snow
&gt;assuming we have any this year (after this drought who knows). And, 3.  the
&gt;endless horror stories I read from people about break downs.  I only commute
&gt;around town and am not afraid to tinker with it.  Add to that the scarcity of
&gt;type 2s for sale in my area and you can see why I am reluctant.  Dave.

You can do it. Save you money to keep your Taurus and buy a Type II. Thanks 
to the list, anything missing can be located in a short time from one of 
the listers. I drove my daily until I pulled it off the road to restore.

The busses go very well in the snow if you keep decent tires on it.

Break downs do occur but they are usually the result of neglect, repairs by 
mechanics who aren't experienced with working on VW's, and the cumulation 
of 30 years of being a beater.

Buy the best rust free bus you can afford and go from there. Keep your 
Taurus and buy a trailer hitch for it and a tow bar for the bus. If you 
have a mechanical failure in town get a ride home and go back with the Taurus.

Our Type II was VERY, VERY reliable and we took it anywhere with little prep.
