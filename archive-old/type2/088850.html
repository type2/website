Mine sometimes would bind on the actual clamp. Try removing the nut and
lifting the clamp with the distributor.

Subject: [T2] Can't remove distributor on 76 Westy


Hello All,

I'm trying to get my distributor out on my 76 Westy and although I've
removed the clamp bolt from the engine (not the adjuster but the one that
holds it down to the block) it still won't budge. Has anyone run into this
problem? I don't see it mentioned in the archives although I may not have
searched for the right words.

Bob
