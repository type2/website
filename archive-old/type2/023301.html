Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny Again

Start reading the archives. There are long threads in there on making more 
power and the benefits or short comings of different gear ratios or trannies.

But--- you could:

Swap your 1600cc SP (single port) engine for a 1600cc DP (dual port) engine 
- actually just swap the heads and then go to a doghouse oil cooler and fan 
shroud.

Move to an extractor type exhaust.

Also a move to smaller type dual carbs - dual ICTs or baby Dells would 
allow improvements in the area of the cam, heads (larger valves) and larger 
exhaust.

None of these little improvements will give you Mustang slaying power but 
though somewhat conservative, can still return increased power, reasonable 
gas mileage, and no loss of durability.

Carefully choose your parts, some are rather poor quality. Just ask for 
opinions on the list.

It's going to be pretty slow by design - but if you get a chance drive 
another bus of similar age and engine so you can be sure that your bus is 
at least equal to it's the vintage peers.

If your bus is significantly slower than another bus of the same age, then 
I would be concerned that the engine isn't putting out the correct 
horsepower or maybe a bearing or brake is dragging.

As for your tranny - if it is working right, then I would stick with it. 
There is no magical tranny that will give you more power and speed without 
some trade off in some other category.

VW chose the gear ratios as a middle ground - geared low enough to allow 
the motor to cool right and high enough to run down the highway about 55 mph.

You can put in a lower geared tranny and get better creeping power but 
loose top speed.

You could put in a higher geared tranny and have zero power at speed, risk 
overheating because the fan is spinning slower (and the engine would 
probably make more heat because it was working harder) but in theory the 
motor would spin slower and make less noise (until it threw a rod). &lt;grin&gt;

Now if you want to spend some money you could start collecting info (it's 
been done) to install a Type IV 2.0 engine which won't make alot more 
power, but there is a good improvement over a single port 1600cc. It will 
last longer if properly maintained.

Then you could dump alot of money into this engine and have alot of power. 
Be sure to read the Type I vs. Type IV threads in the archives.

If you are REALLY rich, take a look at Porsche 901 transmissions. There is 
a myriad of gear ratios available so pick carefully. Your bus will require 
about the same rpm's regardless of which tranny you put in with that same 
engine.

That all said, I would start reading anything you can get your hands on. 
There are 50 years of writing on this very subject.

Somebody said along time ago - &quot;Speed costs money, how fast you want to go?&quot;

Is your bus not putting out 100% of it's 50 or 60 HP, or are you expecting 
more of it than it was designed to do?

If it is the first choice then start tuning and adjusting (one thing at a 
time - tune and test - mistake? Tune again. When that one item is right, 
tune the next thing. It will teach you how one element of your bus affects 
another). At least you can get the most out of what you already have. A 
tune up can deliver a few horses and just a  few horses count alot when you 
only have 50 or 60 to start with!

If it is the second choice - then ask - is it REALLY important that you go 
fast/have more power? $$$ If it is begin looking at your options. $$$ Don't 
forget more speed is going to have require more suspension and braking 
refinements which obviously cost more $$$ too. You don't wanna die right? 
Most of all I don't want you to kill one of us out there sharing the road 
with you cause you can't turn or stop.

If is more power you seek - try to separate the show cars and hot rods with 
short life span engines with an excess of chrome from the engines that will 
take you far with a little more power. Money well spent in my book when you 
get 100K miles from an engine versus one that lasts 42K miles.

Another option is a transplant. Porsche 911 engines are sweet but you might 
be able to buy 3 more busses for the cost. Water cooled transplants are 
nice but you gotta hide a radiator somewhere. I am working on a Trans-vair 
conversion (collecting parts more like it) with a plain Jane factory engine 
that puts out 110 HP. Same gas mileage. These engines are good tough 
engines too but require some creativity for installation (or with a 
Trans-vair kit). I'll refine intake, exhaust and the heating systems before 
I'm done.

Again - start with the archives - it is full of discussion on this very 
subject.

Hope I didn't bore you, I ramble and try to cover a subject thoughly to 
best of my knowledge.
