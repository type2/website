--Brian,


&gt;I have seen some with the middle seat facing the &gt;front, and some with the middle seat facing the &gt;sliding door against the drivers side wall.

They always faced forward (factory passenger buses) in all years. Other variations involve busdriver feng shui.

&gt;For my next bus, I'd like to get a non-camper with a &gt;sun roof.  Are those sun roof's a PITA?

Depends on the condition you get it in. I bought a $150 '79 sunroof (complete) and it works like a champ.

The cables are very expensive if you have to replace them, and rust can be an issue if the 4 drain tubes were not maintenances. 

Upside, the sunroof is huge! I can't wait to get the '79 on the road and head up to Sequoia Nat'l Forest, look at the big trees thru the big window.

Or my kids can anyway :(

Billy
