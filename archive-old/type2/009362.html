 &quot;Stop-Accelerator pedal Qty.1&quot; : 211 721 625A

My family's brand new 68 came with one and my poor '69 had one too.
DPO installed sissal mats OVER carpet in our '70, I'm not sure
the gizmo is down there or not. But it's there to keep you from
stretching the accelerator cable. That stock 1600 dp is so powerful
you never NEED to really open the carb all the way :)

	I've always felt that the DJet was an electronic simulation of
a carb, while the trusty KJet was a FI system designed to provide
the maximum value for the minimum fuss. So the DJet is a carburetor
you can't adjust which has wierd moving parts. I'd still take one over
a 30-PICT but I've got more FI than Carb experience, and a 30-PICT is
probably more reliable.
	There are two kinds of DJet owners, those who have done a 
tongue test on the manifold pressure sensor... and those who pay someone
else :)

	I spent four fun hours in our truck this weekend, moving a
very large number of book cases from San Francisco to Berkeley. There's
not much more fun to be had than driving your bus around and yaking with 
a pal on a sunny spring day. :)
