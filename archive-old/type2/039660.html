Subject: Re: Fridge

Sounds like you may need a new fridge to me. The old fridge(25+ years) that came
with my van just about worked on 12v, but on propane the small flame wasn't
enough to get it going. I was advised to stand it upside down for a day or two
to try and clear any blockages. No such luck. I don't the official line but I
guess that the performance of these absorption fridges degrades over time to the
point where they're pretty useless.

After buying a brand new replacement fridge I realised how well these things
should work. The fridge is noticeably colder after 30 mins. To work well they
need a good flow of air over the cooling fins. If your fridge is in situ make
sure cabinet/external vents are clear both at the bottom and top. If you're
testing the fridge out of the cabinet then you lose the air flow up the back
caused by convecting air in the restricted space and the fridge won't cool as
well - but it should still work.

A new fridge ain't cheap - in the UK about 3 times the price of a standard
domestic fridge. But the ice cold beer makes it worth every penny.

&gt; Does anybody have an ideas as to how long it takes for a Dometic propane
&gt; fridge to get cold? I finally got mine fired up in my Riveria last night and
&gt; let it run for almost a few hours and didn't really notice much difference
&gt; in temperature. I ran out of propane before I could really tell so I
&gt; couldn't let it run longer to see if it actually was getting colder, but I
&gt; just thought I would ask if anybody knew any details on these fridges.
&gt;
&gt; cheers....
