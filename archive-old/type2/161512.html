Subject: Re: [T2] Craftsman tools

Craftsman Club sounds like a great idea.

Since I used to be in the automotive tool &amp; equipment business  
(publishing side of things) I have a pretty nice set of tools.

I personally prefer the BETA tool set (Italian) that I got from one  
of my advertisers. Nice huge suitcase of tools, bright orange  
handles, and they have taken many beatings.

Had plenty of Cooper/Snap-on/Matco/MAC and other tools...but my BETA  
tools are a complete set and get toted around in the bus.

I think I'll look into the club deal, though. I mean, a person can  
never have TOO many tools, can he? (Or she?)
