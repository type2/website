&gt; 78 came with Hydrolic's...however, make sure thats whats in them...the way 
&gt; you can tell is by the rods...unbolt the tappet mechanism and pull a rod out 
&gt; ( of course this means youll probably have to adjust them anyway)...if the 
&gt; rods are solid stainless steel, they are hydrolics, if they are stainless 
&gt; overlayed with aluminum, they are not.  For Hydrolics the adjustment is get 
&gt; both valves closed (TDC) for that cylinder and back them out 11/2 turns and 

almost right, turn em IN 1 1/2 turns 

&gt; dont touch them again...
