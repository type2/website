Subject: Re: [T2] re:Old Paint

Here's a little secret about getting wax off a car
from a guy who used to own a detail shop - dissolve a
box of baking soda in 2 gallons of water, and wash the
car with it. It will strip all the wax off, usually in
one washing. Cost: about a buck and half.

&gt; wax more than 4 times a year; the buildup is a b!_at_#%
