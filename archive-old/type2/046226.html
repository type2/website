You've picked on of the more controversial topics IMHO. :-)
I've used both CHT and oil temp and installed them in a few different 
configurations.  If you install the CHT properly it will give you the most 
useful information of the two.  You'll get much faster response and it's an 
inherently more accurate gauge. 
The CHT comes with a sender that is supposed to fit under a spark plug.  If 
you use this sender you will get excellent readings, but I've found it to be 
a real PITA to install.  If you don't install it properly you can develop a 
leak under the spark plug and erode a little valley in the head under the 
spark plug and this isn't good.  What I do now is cut off the loop on the 
sender.  Then I position the sender between two fins, at their base, and in a 
location that is not close to a cylinder head stud and as near the combustion 
chamber as physically possible.  It will take a bit of trial and error to 
find the best place.  That place will be the one that you get the highest and 
quickest reading from.
I have the most experience on my '71.  300 degrees is where I try to keep it. 
 When I get to 350 I take my foot out of it.  When I get to 400 I start 
looking for the top of the hill and if I get much over that I pull over and 
run it at a fast idle to cool it off before I proceed.  Using this technique 
I've gotten almost 140,000 miles of trouble free driving in my '71.  
I had a '79 Adventurewagen (high top) and ran it for about a week with a CHT 
gauge.  It ran about 50-100 degrees hotter than my '71.
If you have a spare head or can borrow the use of one you can do a trial 
install under the plug.  The trick is to keep the ring from pulling out too 
much where it's connected to the wire.  When you do the install on your 
engine be sure to torque the plug per spec.  If you drive like that for a 
while you will be able to develop a good base line.  Then you can move the 
sender between two fins and compare the readings in some different locations 
until you find a spot that's comparable to under pug location.
