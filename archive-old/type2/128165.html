Subject: cv dished washer

I'm greasing my cv's w/o removing from axles. 
They still have the dished washers on them.

Replacing one pitted joint.
Heeding Bentley and the archieves, I've left the
washer off the new joint.
Gotta wonder about the 1/16&quot; play that the joint has
to freely move on the spline.
Is that ok, or am I missing something?
Thanks
