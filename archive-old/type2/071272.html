Subject: California Salvageyards???
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Still working on &quot;The list&quot; of major VW oriented salvageyards in North America
(while searching for my high roof of course!) Have received a surprisingly low
number of responses from our California folks. It seems to me that there are
ten times as many VW's on the road throughout California than most other
states. AND, since this is where most of the aftermarket camper conversions
were done, naturally my search has led me there. I'm hoping that somewhere out
there it exists, so please E-me directly w/ the name, # , whatever you have so
I can call them up &amp; also add them to my list. I will post the results very
soon for all those interested... 
TIA!!!
