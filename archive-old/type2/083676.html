&gt; &gt;Now, on my bus, I would not run the K&amp;N.  I don't need the anti-clog
&gt; &gt;property, and I am concerned about fine particulates getting into the
&gt; &gt;engine.  Better to use a filter that does a better job on all particles,
&gt; &gt;and it's hard to improve on the stock item.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW my experience on the Mustang was good.  I put a K&amp;N filter on the car
&gt; about 5-6 years ago and drove another 100k miles in that time (total of
&gt; 210k miles).

A mustang has its engine in front and draws air from the front grille,
where air is relatively clean.  A bus draws its air from the back, in its
own self-created dust cloud.  Even my well-sealed engine compartment gets
rather dusty if I drive a dirt road.  This tells me that a K&amp;N isn't what
I would want on my bus.


&gt; Still runs low 13's at 105mph, idles smooth and gets 25mpg on
&gt; the highway.  If I could find a K&amp;N to fit my bus I would use it in a
&gt; heartbeat.  It's true that the K&amp;N filter element is coarse compared to a
&gt; stock paper filter, but it is also oiled.  Different filtering technology
&gt; so direct comparisons of the media are irrelevent.

No, but direct comparison of the filtering performance is.  K&amp;N is good
with coarse particulate, but not so good with fine particulates, as has
been shown in several comparisons.  K&amp;N talks about &quot;filtering efficiency&quot;
and they show up very good there because they measure the mass of the
particulate filtered.  Fine particulate has little mass, compared to
coarse particulate, so it doesn't show up in the advertising comparisons.

I empahsize that K&amp;N makes an excellent filter for specific applications,
namely racing.  What works best for racing isn't always what is best for a
street vehicle

The best performing filters are 2-stage designs, with a centrifugal filter
for coarse particulates and a paper element for fine particulates.  You'll
find this sort of filter on farm and construction equipment, and hanging
off the side of over-the-road trucks.

They're a bit large for a bus, however.
&gt; One last thing to
&gt; consider - buying one K&amp;N and using it for the life of your vehicle keeps a
&gt; lot of dirty paper filters out of the landfills.

There are tradeoffs everywhere.  Cleaning a K&amp;N or foam filter produces a
quantity of oil-solvent waste that has to be considered.

&gt; Bottom line though - if
&gt; you're serious about your choice of air filter, read all of the information
&gt; available and make up your own mind, and then try not to let it become a
&gt; religious matter.  To each their own.  :-)

Sound advice.

George
