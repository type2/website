Subject: Re: [T2] Half Empty/Full

Seann's post is on target, so I'll just add a couple of things.

Having had an MG, I know what you're talking about. But it's not likely 
to be a voltage issue. It's probably the sender.

The thing to do is to put this on the list for your next engine 
rebuild. While the engine is out, deal with the tank and the sender. 
Until then, watch your odometer.
