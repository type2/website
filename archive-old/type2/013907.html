'counterbalance' on the carb linkage is riding/rubbing on the manifold.

I say counterbalance because that is what it looks like - sort of a half =

Peace Sister,

&gt; I'm having trouble with my accelerator pedal.
&gt; Everytime I go to press on it it sticks , so it makes
&gt; my bus jump. When I start off in 1st I have to rev my
&gt; engine a little before I let off the clutch so it wont
&gt; jerk my bus. Does anyone know whats goin on here and
&gt; how I can fix this. Any responses would be
&gt; appreciated. Thanx
