Subject:
How are flywheels measured (Was 'looking for 228mm flywheel')

  The original message reminded me of this.  I see these measures ( 200mm,
  215mm, 228mm ) tossed around a lot, since I have easy access to a
  wrecking yard, where are these dimensions actually measured, bolt hole to
  bolt hole, clutch disc contact surface??

  Does anyone also know the number of teeth on the flywheels, all VW
  flywheels. Type 1, type 4, porsche 914 etc.

  Thanks,
  Jeff
