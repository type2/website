&gt;No professional mechanic I know of offers a &quot;tuneup&quot; which includes a

&gt;see if they are worn enough to try and convince some one who only wanted
&gt;spend a minimum amount of money that their car needs it.. Maybe change
&gt;the oil in the oil bath cleaner.

&gt;I have been in the mechanic business and *no one*
&gt;would pay me for compression test unless they knew enough about
&gt;engines to ask for one...in which case, they probably did their own
&gt;compression test.

Well, I was a professional mechanic at one time, and every tune up I did
included a compression check. In fact, my standard tune up speech was &quot;I'll
do a compression check which will cost you $2.00 (this was a while ago,
like 1965) and if the compression is okay I'll do a tune up which will be
$xxx. If the compression is low or irregular, we'll decide what to do at
that point.&quot; I just wouldn't do a tune up without a compression check
first. No sense in tuning an engine with no compression in one hole.
