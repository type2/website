Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil temp sender in sump plate (was &quot;Snake oil or
  real product&quot;)

Hello All  I would like to add to this discussion . Everything that was done 
by the factory was mostly right and done for a reason, cost or benifit to 
whatever. When you start changing things, High performance  etc. then this 
changes everything. I have both and run them, I like them both when used 
right. I have used magnets over the yearsand seen some that worked real good. 
I have one that fits inside the pick-up screen. I have also seen the pick-up 
screen block off the pick-up, cooked a motor with only 3500 miles. The screen 
was an after market one the guy had put on when he put in a temp. sender in 
the plate. this was on a stock type 1 .  I have also had the screen restrict 
the oil pick-up on high rev engines, you don't see them on Forumal Vees , or 
drag cars.  I tend to keep them on my buses , even the higher powered ones. 
Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem import service Salem Va
