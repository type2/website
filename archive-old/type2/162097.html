Subject: Timing Marks

A friend of mine is not certain that the alternator belt pulley  
(crankshaft end) on his type IV engine is original and therefore  
questioning whether the timing mark on his pulley is in the correct  
spot for his particular engine.   Can someone tell me whether all  
type IV engine alternator belt pulleys were created equal with regard  
to the timing mark?  Or were there a zillion different variations  
like the fan belt pulleys for type I engines?

Thanks,

Tim
