Subject: Question on Scat Cams/lifters

Hi gang...

I'm wondering if anyone with first hand experience with the
camshafts/lifters from this supplier in a type IV application, can
provide some factual data on their experiences...

I took apart a Vanagon low mileage engine recently...it was supposed to
have been rebuilt recently...new heads, black bearly off the cam
lobes...new P&amp;C...but the #1 rod had spun a bearing, and tossed it
everywhere til it was gone..

I had a little trouble figuring out it was a Scat cam, as it had no
stamped-in markings, but comparing the casting markings against a new
one, along with the cam gear, figured it to be a 20086...

So here's what else I found...
Two of the eight new lifters were concave....

All of the lobes were worn providing a lift (subtracting lobe width from
height) of anywhere from .219 to .259...

I've heard a lot of negative comments about Scat cams over the years,
but nothing recently concerning premature lobe wear. I'm looking for
some first hand experiences if anyone has them.

Thanks,
Den.
