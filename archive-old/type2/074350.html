Subject: Bilge Blowers

I know some of you have tried the bilge blowers out and are impressed with
the volume of air they deliver.  I thought I had saved a few of the posts so
I could order one and give it a try (I try to be open to new ideas).

I have a gas heater ready to install, but thought it would be nice to have
numerous options for heat for those &quot;marginal&quot; days when I could save the
gas heater and use the stock heat with an extra boost.

But I now cannot find the emails I thought I had saved.  For those of you
that have purchased and installed bilge blowers, would you please send me a
source for them so I can order one?

Thanks.
