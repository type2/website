Subject: Re: [T2] Bay 4wd prototypes, rambling, a solution

All you do is build a modified front housing for a VW transmission that 
handles an output shaft bearing next to the shift rod. You extend the 
pinion shaft out of the front of the tranny right through this new bearing.

It's been done and there is a web page somewhere with detailed pictures.

The next challenge is to create a front differential with a matching gear 
ratio - maybe existing pinion shaft and differential out of a matching 
transmission?

It would take a long driveshaft with a carrier bearing too like my CR-V has.

Might want to add a viscous coupler to minimize binding in turns.

Been thinking about this for a long time...
