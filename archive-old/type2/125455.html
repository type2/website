Hello Doyt

Thanks a lot for your support.
I really apreciate your comments. I know that there are a lot
of people in this list ready to help, even if the one that needs help is on
the other side of the ocean, or on the most western country in Europe.
I apreciate all the help that everyone gave me...and i know i will learn a
lot by trying to read all the messages (even those not intended for me).
Thanks again to you all.

from Lisbon, PORTUGAL
Joco Nuno Ribeiro
