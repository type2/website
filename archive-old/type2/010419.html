	Jill,
	You don't say what 'wear about' means or whether the same problem
happened 25,000 miles ago. In general, 25,000 miles is an unreasobably
short life for a rebuilt. Did the rebuild correct one problem and
the recent failure involve some other component?

	Have you tried calling the local VW shops and asking what they have
or can do? Mark Stephens has a good reputation, the archives should have
his contact numbers, he's probably a good base-line for cost comparison.
If your engine is worn but hasn't failed catastropically, you can possibly
re-use the case, crank, cam and rods. Maybe the heads too.

	I don't think new Type 4s are being built anywhere anymore. Type 4
enthusiasts will point out that this is because they are tougher than
Type 1/2 and can be rebuilt forever.

	Bill
