I did go and look at my FTP site.
What I had done is to upload without checking the case of the picture names. 
I had to go in and make them lower case, It has been done and seems to work. 
If anyone finds more bugs please let me know.
BTW I have family in Christchurch who took a westy of NZ in 1970!

&lt;&lt; Very keen on looking at your 70 Westy Brochure, but it seems only the cover
 page link actually works... :-(
