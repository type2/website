&gt; Just bought the most important item for my new bus- a 5 lb. industrial fire

&gt; else mounts their fire extinguishers. (I'm sure we all have one in our bus-
&gt; Right?)
&gt; Anyone have any creative ideas? TBear

mine's mounted horzontally behind the drivers seat, I always enter and
exit through the side door, so it is most convienent for me.
