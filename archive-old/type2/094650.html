The fuel solenoids by NOS are made to inject extra fuel with the nitrous
so you don't burn up your engine by running too lean. They are not made
to control all the fuel going into the engine, they just provide a
little extra, not cut off the flow to the injectors or carb.

NOS makes fuel solenoids for their nitrous kits.  These are rated for
very 
high flow, as they are designed for high horsepower V-8's.  They are
pricey 
though.  I believe you can find them at Summit Racing as well as other
speed 
shops.
