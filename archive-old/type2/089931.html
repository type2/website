Subject: fuse block info needed

Was  assisting on a wiring call  and during troubleshooting  realized 
that  i was looking at a  73 fuse panel and wiring patched into a 72 
bus.  PO had also left a lot of wires hanging.  What i need is a chart 
that shows me the terminal designations on the back side of the fuse 
panel. In all of my tons of info here i cant locate a  simple picture to 
show what terminal is what.  I can see no terminal designations marked 
on the panel.  The fuse panel appeared to be relatively new and is  
probably a  replacement fuse panel.
thanks
