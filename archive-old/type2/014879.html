Hey All,
     I just made reservations at Mountain Creek Campground for the Winter
campout this weekend, the owner said they won't be there this weekend, so he
needs payment before then. You need a 4 digit passcode to get in the entrance,
so I don't know what this does to those that decide to come at the last
minute. So, if you're planning on coming, I'd give them a call, (717)
486-7681. See ya there!   Jeff S.

$24.00/ night, includes electric, and there damn well better be electric!!
