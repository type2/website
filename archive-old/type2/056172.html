The heater from the 73 (BN-4) will fit into your 77 (had a BA-6?), and if
hooked up right, will heat things quite nicely.

BUT: installing the BN-4 into your 77 will require you cut several very big
holes in your bus, including one right through the firewall and the body
work just forward of that.  Are you sure you want to do that?  Also, if
you're running an aux. battery in the '77, you'll need to find another
place to put the battery, since the BN-4 will occupy the left side battery
area.

Not familiar with the differences (if any) between switches, but that's a
solvable problem either way.

If the BN-4 conversion/installation is not done properly and the heater is
not tuned and vented correctly, the odds of your dying in a fiery ball of
flames or of CO2 poisoning may be significantly increased.

I've installed an Eberspacher BN-4 in a late loaf, and it's butchery.  And
gas heaters -- especially &quot;custom&quot; installed ones -- scare the hell out of
me, as I've said many times before.  There are folks out there who disagree
with me on this, citing the numerous safety design features, especially in
the Eberspacher heaters.  There (was? is?) a gas heater repair guy on the
list, and he may have a lot to contribute to questions like this, but to my
recollection he's never contributed anything to the list other than
advertisements (hint, hint.)

IMVHO, I'd suggest you get a BA-6 (under the bus) heater and install that
instead.  Less effort, less hacking, and the &quot;correct&quot; heater for your bus.
You should be able to sell you BN-4 to someone to recoup much or all of the
&quot;upgrade&quot; cost.  That's just my CDN$0.02 worth, tho'...
