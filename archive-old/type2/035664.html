Subject: Cold transmissions

I've been reading the cold transmission posts with a chuckle; my '76
Westy has an automatic transmission with the exact opposite problem.
When I go out to the parking lot in the evening when it's really cold,
the poor thing will barely creep along in Drive until the ATF warms up.
Good thing my driveway slants DOWN to the street.
