&gt; the 'step one - remove the engine' part. That scares me, as I do not have

get an automatic......ok seriously

check the clutch cable, probably broke or stretched, don't have to remove
engine for that, couple hours of getting dirty to do it the first
time...few tools needed and level of difficulty is novice.

if that isn't it, call your mechanic it probably does need to have the
engine dropped

but be sure to watch him do it, it really isn't that hard
