Subject: head gasket-base shim

Hi Folks,	
	I have a type IV built using head gaskets.  I have one side apart
replacing a bad cylinder-piston.  Would you put it back together with new
head gaskets on that side or replace them with the VWSB recommended base
shim. I would rather not pull the other side and do the switch on that
side as well.  The compressions are fine on that side and they are dry and
tight. thanks. jon
