&gt; I have spent the evening trying to cure a truly annoying case of brake
&gt; squeal on the '80.  I don't know if I've licked it

Hi Steve

One thing I have done to reduce squeal seemed to work.  I had a fellow tell me the
leading edge of the shoe or pad should have a chamfer on it.. and the new ones do
not...

so, when I install a set of shoes or pads that do not have a 45 deg chamfer on the
leading edge,, I use a big file and put one on....

It seemed to have worked
