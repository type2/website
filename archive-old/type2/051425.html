&gt;Have at it!  The first correct answer is definitely someone who &quot;Knows too
&gt;much!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Alas! No one got it! I *am* depressed! 

I'm going to let everyone in on a little secret.  Steve had no clue what the
heck it was either.  It was in a spare VW hardware can of mine he was
digging through looking for a banjo nut.

So don't everyone who tried feel too bad.

It was also pretty crusty, should have seen the bus I pulled that vent wing
out of.  Is a pretty common part though, in both front and rear ventwings
of all bays, early rabbits, and maybe the vanagon but I have no idea for
sure.  Believe it or not, the condition of that one was good enough
in my estimation at the time, that I didn't toss it in the trash 8-)
