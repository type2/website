Subject: Re: New Pistons ?

He is probably referring to domed pistons.

You can get domed, flat or dished pistons for various compression ratios.
The drawback is that the higher the compression the hotter it will run.
Buses often have the dished pistons to reduce the running temp.

&gt;Putting in new Pistons to a '73 1700cc dual carb type
&gt;IV engine. Buddy of mine told me to make sure the new
&gt;pistons are &quot;high compression&quot; to get more power out
&gt;of the engine. What does this mean and what should I
&gt;be looking for?
