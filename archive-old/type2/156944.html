  Paul-

  So we are free to manufacture our own &quot;almost&quot; identical parts
(like the Chinese).  If you all will help me put the bus back
together we could use the parts I have as the models.  They could be
scanned in 3-D, right?  I think the type 4 cross bar  would make a
superior engine mount if it were modified to fit. Might be a good
idea to buy the axle adapters if they have them although a machinist
looked at the ones I have and said he thought they were not straight
and would cause vibrations at some exact speed. (they don't)

   John I.
