&gt;After changing over my non-CA FI, vacuum hoses, parts, exhaust stuff, 
&gt;etc. I still have a vacuum leak.  I think I can tell I still have a leak by 
&gt;watching the idle RPM change.  The NEW $150 Idle stabilizer (for a 
&gt;box with one computer chip in it !) didn't solve the problem.
&gt;
&gt;I took it to my local very friendly mechanic who hooked it up to his 
&gt;machine which read the exhaust CO levels.  Here is his technique:
&gt;Let out a puff of propane into the area of suspected vacuum leak.  
&gt;Watch the CO meter, if it jumps, the leak is in the area of the puff.
&gt;
&gt;Worked great, and pointed me to 2 leaky areas, but here's the 
&gt;question:
&gt;
&gt;Is there a home mechanic equivalent to this vacuum leak check?
&gt;Another vacuum leak technique?
&gt;A cheap CO meter?

You can hook up a tach and spray Gumout (using the red straw to pinpoint
it) around suspected areas while watching the tach for changes in engine
speed.  Don't go overboard spraying since obviously Gumout is flammable.
