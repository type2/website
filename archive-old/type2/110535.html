Subject: Oil temp sender location

I know this has been discussed before but I have a location that
I haven't seen discussed yet.

I'm getting some Westach gauges for my bus and they have this cool
flow-through oil temp sensor. It has a 1/8&quot; npt nipple and socket so
you can screw a second sensor on it. I'm thinking about putting this
under the oil pressure sensor on the case top by the dizzy.

Does this seem like a reasonable location? It would simplify wiring
and be less prone to damage than putting it on the bottom of the case.
