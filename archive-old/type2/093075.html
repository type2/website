Subject: Re: [T2] Torsion bar adj

Vehicle weight. Disconnect the trailing arm from the spindle. Lift the 
trailing arm with a trolley jack. Pry it out past the lower stop and let 
the vehicle down on a jack stand slowly. Should go that easily - did this 
on my Beetle.

You might consider a chain to control the trailing arm if something popped 
loose and went flying.

I didn't and had no surprises but it might just be because I was lucky. 
Don't rely on luck.

Before you decide you need to readjust your torsion bars - load the vehicle 
as you usually use it - driver, passenger (?), people in the back seat (?), 
trailer (?) and have a friend use a carpentry level to see if the frame 
rail or bottom body seam is level or still sagging to the rear. Our bus 
sits level with two people in the front.



&gt;I've finally gathered the courage to adjust the torsion bars to compensate
&gt;for the sagging rear end of my bus.
&gt;
&gt;Done the reading, even some Beetle books, but I'm still left wondering what
&gt;the best tool is to use to compress the spring plate in order to remove it?
