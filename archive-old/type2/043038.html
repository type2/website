Subject: thanks...

I really appreciate all the information you guys have given me. First of all 
I have good memory and remember that the hinge was to the back not the 
front, it didn't have a fuel panel but just a exposed cap and that all the 
cabinets are behind the driver. I couldn't get in since it was locked and 
the individual who showed it to me wasn't the owner but his father, no keys 
= no peek inside. It was an automatic (kinda cool) and I didn't see the 
cooler/refer but that doesn't mean that it wasn't there just that the 
windows were a little dirty and it had a lot of personal belongings in it. 
It was orange with I believe orange plaid/yellow maybe? Will be driving out 
because the suspense of knowing what it is is killing me. Joke is that the 
po doesn't think it's that valuable to quote _&quot;only a volkswagen&quot;. So I 
think it's probably a steal. I know that it had approx. $600 in motor work 
done and that's the only thing they want back out of it. His son bought a 
camaro and wants out of the vw. No problem on my part....
