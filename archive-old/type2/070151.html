Subject: A Lunchtime Trip: 67 DD Panel

Hi All,

A friend of mine who works in the neighboring office bldg called me up and
wanted to know if he could take me out to lunch.  He said afterward we
could putt around in his 67 Double Door Panel.  Obviously, I could not
refuse!  8-)

I helped him look at this Panel about 1 1/2 years ago and influenced him
to purchase it.  Since that time it has been sitting in storage, getting
maintenance-type attention.  This Panel was originally from Nevada, but
had seen some winter-time war duty in Pennsylvania Salty Winters and is
still unrestored.  It has a few quirks, but it's definitely a fun Panel.

I have a confession:  Although I own many, many splittie Buses, I haven't
had one to drive for well over 5 yrs--about the same time I've been
married for some reason!!!!  Driving around the KC Burbs over lunch was
quite an rejuvenating experience for me.  I want to get one of my
Splitties going *bad*!!  This one even has the original cab divider
installed.  It kept some of the monza-muffler noise out, but not all.
Driving home after in work in my 84 Vanagon was a stark contrast with my
lunchtime ride.  Still sorta utilitarian, but doesn't have the soul of the
old Splittie.
