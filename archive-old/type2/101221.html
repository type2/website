Subject: [T2] Accessory Vespa for Bus

dude if you are going to get a vespa and you are into VWs for got sakes get a 
vintage vespa.  the prices have dropped on them considerably in the last few 
months as the economy sucks and people have been bringing them into the 
country like crazy.  you can get a bad ass totally RESTORED old vespa for LESS
 than the price of a new one.  the old ones have many things the new ones 
dont such as style, manual transmission, and really cheap parts for when 
something breaks, and you wont look like a stupid trend hopper on an old one. 
 
or better yet get a new bajaj scooter looks just like the old vespas but less 
than 2 grand.  www.bajajusa_dot_com  and www.bulletproofscooters_dot_com has them for 
$1747 out the door until the end of october...that is an AMAZING price.  in 
either instance if you want more info on pretty much any vespa email me off 
the list.  

the new vespa being crap comments are just my opinion.

Brennan.
