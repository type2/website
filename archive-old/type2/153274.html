Subject: RE:The Hubcap

I had it in fall of 2001. If I remember correctly I picked it up in Fla from
Dan Kinsey. I returned it to NC with the 58 Binz when I bought it. I had it
at  the Darlington show spring of 2002. I honestly can't remember who I
passed it on to but it left here in 2002. The purpose of the Hubcap was to
pass it on and let it go all around the world if possible. It was never
meant for one person to have it permanently as far as I know. I would
actually like to see it make it here again. Later
