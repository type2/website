Thanks.

There is a set of CIMA on E-Bay right now, for a 1700.

I may need to rebuild a 1700 in the near future, so I thought about stocking 
up on the CIMA set.  But if they are from Brazil, I definitely do not want 
them.

I guess that is why the seller did not answer my question and to the country 
of origin; he just said they were CIMA, like I was suppose to know!?!?!?

So, I will plan on just a new set of rings. The 1700 has about 82K miles on 
it, and the compression loss may be due to rings.  I guess I will just have 
it pulled down and have a top end rebuild done.

Now I can go out to dinner with the family without worrying if I missed a 
good deal!!

&gt;
&gt; &gt; If a set of CIMA P&amp;C are not German, and they are said to be 20 years 
&gt;old
&gt; &gt; OEM, who/where would they come from??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry for such an amateur question.
&gt;
&gt;Cimas have always come from Brazil. Mahles (not Mahle/Cimas, which are
&gt;Brazilian) and Kolbenschmidts come from Germany.
