It may be too badly damaged but you could try an impact driver with the
appropriate Allen key bit installed.  I once was saved from drilling and
re-tapping a hole using this method.  You might also try tightening the
Allen bolt first before trying again to release it.  Probable cause of
seizure is corrosion fusion which you may be able to shock free.  Impact
driver would be favourite.  Otherwise its the hard route I fear.
Same process applies to the tailgate striker which I think is the part you
refer to.  May be more successful as that's a downward straight hit.  Don't
bend the floor though!

^ Any techniques for getting these things off the
&gt; vehicle?   I may have already stripped the nut, and if this is the case,
&gt; could I drill it out, or use any other techniques?   I'm also having
&gt; problems removing the rear hatch latch which is seized.
