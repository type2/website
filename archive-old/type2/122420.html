Richard,

What can you tell me about those seats? My 79 mexico beige, brown plaid
westy has seats that are almost exactly like those (brown velour with the
same topstitching), but they have brown vinyl backs not orange. I always
thought they were from another van, but wasn't sure what year. They are very
good seat covers, but I am sure my 79 should have had brown plaid seats.
