I found the table that attaches to the dash via two brackets and a leg.   It
is wood grained Formica with black molding. I have the dash brackets but not
the leg (easy to make with a piece of pipe or conduit). I don't know what
it's worth because I have never seen one for sale but if someone wants it,
make me an offer. TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
