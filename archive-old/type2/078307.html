Subject: Re: [T2] westy vs. campmobile question

&gt; &gt; Did Westfalia/Riviera make non-popping conversions?
&gt;
&gt;I can't speak to Riviera, but Westfalia sure did.  They don't seem to be
&gt;that common but Dolan had a '76 hardtop Westy for some time.  The pop-top
&gt;was optional equipment.

I, too, have a hardtop Westy. It's missing a lot of the camping gear, but it 
has the rear ceiling cabinet, flip-up table, and the folding rear bed.
