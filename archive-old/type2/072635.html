Subject: cooling shutter control
Message-Id: &lt;v0151010bb36377f16a7d_at_[207.172.43.81]&gt;

I suspect that the thermostat/rod//shutter link/shutters on the 1776 in my
'71  is not stock and not complete. Mine has the doghouse oil cooler.  My
problem is that I am having trouble getting the main shutter link to fully
open and fully close the shutter assemblies.

My shutter link has four holes in it. Each of the four holes captures a
shaft on one of the four shutters.  I just visited my favorite place in the
NVA area where we sifted through piles of ac parts.  They found one dog
house fan housing.  On this one, each adjacent pair of shutters has its own
short link.  The main link grabs a single pin on each of these sub-links.
It does not grab the four shutter shafts.

So the action is as follows: the shutter expands, its rod pushes the main
link to the left, the main link pushes each of the sub-links to the left,
the sub-links rotate the individual shutter vanes.

So his linkage had the sub-links and mine does not. The drawing in RMMW
catalog does not show these sub-links.

My questions:
1. Which engines use the sub-links? Should a '71 block have them?
2. Is there a main link which matches these sub-links and has only two
holes in it?

Thanks, Jack
