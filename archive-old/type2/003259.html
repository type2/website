Honing the cylinders is very easy, just use a constant in and out motion
with a low speed drill, and don't overdo it.  Afterwards, wash the cylinders
out with hot water and dish detergent, then immediately dry them.  Use new
rings, of course.

Any black hi-temp or bbq spray paint should work on the outside of the
cylinders.

&gt;how difficult is it to hone cylinders by myself? i know i can rent a honer
&gt;bit cheap... also, the cylinders are pretty rusty looking, and i was
&gt;wondering if i should paint them (i'll be repainting the tin and case and
&gt;fan housing... nothing like that clean newly painted look to an engine
&gt;you're putting back in)...
&gt;
&gt;anyone have any advice?
&gt;
