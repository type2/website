&gt; Hi Bob,
&gt;
&gt; Someone had an idea a while back to get an original AC setup, and
&gt; find a domestic alternator of the correct size to replace the AC
&gt; pump . That would give you a dual-alternator system and a LOT of
&gt; spare juice to run the AC.
&gt;
&gt; OTOH... converting rotational force into electrical energy that will
&gt; be used to spin a motor doesn't make sense to me. Too many
&gt; conversions wastes power, and there isn't all that much HP there to
&gt; start with.

I don't know of any 12V air conditioning units.  The only way to do this
would be to invert the 12V to 110V with a _big_ inverter, then run a 110V
AC unit on that.  Not economical at all.

Whatever happened to just spritzing oneself with a spray bottle now and
then?  :)
