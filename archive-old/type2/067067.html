Subject: Re: seat interchangeability

Can anybody tell me what the knobs and levers under the seats and dash are for?
I never knew on my bug (didn't care, i was a blissninny).  Now I have a 69 bus
and I dunno nuthin.  What are the Red levers?  Left is heat?  Right is defog?
Green knobs are vents, I guess.

I _know_ what a stupid question this is, but I also know it'll have easy answers.
Probably find out every year is different.  Or else I'll hear a lot of 
&quot;Knobs? What knobs?&quot;
