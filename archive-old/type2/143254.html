&gt; I haven't reviewed the archives yet, is there a FAQ I should be aware of

The only sources I know of are the discussions that have happened here and
on the Samba.

Just keep in mind that you have a limited source supply - Your alternator.

That alt only puts out 55amps (or more if you're canadian... You might be
lucky!) and a good chunk of that is used to keep your bus rolling,
headlights on, charge your battery, listen to tunes...etc. You see where
this is going.

I have 2000 watt inverter. My battery would start draining before I reached
that level of power if everything is turned on. But as you say, charging
your laptop should be fine in most any condition.

I recommend getting the best quality and lowest wattage inverter you can
afford. Especially if you plan on hooking yours up permanently (as mine will
be when I get to work on my cabinets again). There is a small amount of
juice lost to the conversion, so I add 50% to the rated wattage of whatever
device I plan on plugging in.

Also, some things are sensitive to the funky waveform of an inverter. There
are inverters called &quot;modified sine wave&quot; converters that supposedly resolve
this issue, but that's open for debate.

In your case, since the only thing you want to power is a laptop, you might
be better off buying a 12v power supply for it. They're available for all
models of laptops, and if you buy off that bay place it'll be reasonably
priced.
