Subject: Horn Wiring - problem solved!

So last night, after getting advice from a number of you, I went back
out for a second look (OK, sixteenth look) and realized that the
steering lock grounding the steering shaft is not an issue because the
horn circuit has switches in BOTH BLOODY SIDES!  The horn is powered
from the coil and thus only hot when the ignition is on.  The steering
lock is off when the ignition is on, so it doesn't matter.  What a
confusing circuit!  Anyway, I'm off for the next couple of days, and
not headed for EB* so I hope to have the horn working by Sunday :-)
After that, the dual brake warning light, the defroster (which will
require the installation of heater boxes, and I'm off to VA safety
inspection.

Steve

*so you don't need to worry about getting lilacs this year, Chris :-)
