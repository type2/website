&gt; ummmm....On a 78 converted to earlier model heat exchangers, I don't
&gt; specifically remember any such supports.....unless you count the
&gt; alternator adjustment bracket on the passengers side....
&gt;
&gt; What about the drivers side?
&gt; Any line drawings or pics on this one?
&gt; I can't see anything specific to the drivers side here:

&gt; It connects to the inner top hole of the heat exchanger/muffler flange

&gt; including 72-74. It carries some of the weight of the exhaust system.


Scott is correct both on the part ID and its near-total absence.  That
bracket (#19) is the rear left support.  The alternator bracket is the
rear right support.  On the early type 4 exhaust this was the total
support, but it was all that was needed.  Now I have to admit I have seen
a total of one bus with the late exhaust that had the front supports.  I
had thought they were original but I do not see them on the fiche that Mr.
Bolen lists.  These brackets were similar to the #19 bracket for the left
rear and mounted between the flange on the &quot;U&quot; pipe (#35) and the engine.
Although I cannot prove it from that fiche, I would swear they exist.  As
Mr. Lyon says the left side rear support was still available last I
checked and would be a doddle to fabricate if it were not.  It is a steel
plate bent and drilled to fit between the top flange on the muffler/heater
box joint and the bottom left corner of the fan shroud.  There is a flat
in this area with four predrilled and tapped holes for the installation of
an accesory A/C compressor and the plate uses one of those holes.

                             OOK!
