&gt; 3) Avoid anything made by Exide, or anything with &quot;Die Hard&quot; on the label,
&gt; especially the Die Hard Gold.  I've had nothing but bad experiences with their
&gt; batteries.

I'm running an Exide in my Bug, mainly because it was the last Bug-sized
battery in Fayetteville after the snowstorm we had last winter killed
everyone's batteries. It works okay.

I do believe this is a YMMV situation, but Interstates are excellent
batteries.
