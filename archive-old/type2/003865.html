I am very displeased with the Bus Depot's slow service. On the
recommendation of several VW enthusiasts, I placed an order over a week and
a half ago for a bunch of parts (mostly sheet metal) for my '73 Westy. After
not hearing anything for about a week, I called them the other day and was
told that I might see my stuff by the end of next week. When I placed my
order at their counter, I was originally told that my parts would be drop
shipped in about three business days. I told them that I really needed my
sheet metal parts ASAP so my welder could get started and not screw up his
work schedule this month.

Assuming my parts do show up next week, it will have taken over 2 1/2 weeks
for receipt. I was really hoping to have at least my sheet metal work done
by the time of &quot;Westies in the Woods&quot; on the 25th. Looks like that is not
going to happen now. Nether my &quot;73 Westy or I am a happy &quot;camper&quot; right now.
