Subject: Type2guy Domain back up.....

There was a &quot;mix up&quot; with my domain name registration...so my email 
and website at type2guy_dot_com were down for almost a week. All is good 
now.

I traveled a long way to the east side of Texas earlier this week and 
found a new VW contact while I was out there. He's got a bunch of old 
busses and stuff. There's a Double Door Panel there I'd love to have. 
But things rust a little more that way than what I've gotten used to 
in west Texas. Who knows. Maybe I can go back after I'm able to save 
a little money or something. It's fun to see all those VW's together. 
Never gets old for me.
