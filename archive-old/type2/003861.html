&gt; so, here's the question:
&gt;
&gt; while searching for the cause of the air loss, we found a large machined
&gt; slot/hole near the heat exchanger.  it is rectangular in shape and cannot
&gt; be seen from the underside of the bus (towards engine compartment.)  on
the
&gt; driver's side, there is a bracket that mounts on top of the hole with two
&gt; bolts to a flange.  from what i recall, the connection is from the engine
&gt; to the heat exchanger?  anyway, the PO had duct tape wrapped around the
hole.
&gt;
&gt; what is this bracket?  can i order another one?  i'm losing a ton of
&gt; heat/air back there and i'm sure the engine isn't being cooled correctly
&gt; either.

The cover for the left side is 021 256 321 D.
For the right side it is 021 256 322 B.

If you can't find one......let me know, I have a few extras.
