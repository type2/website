Subject: 76 westy No start after long trips???

Hey VW'ers,

My 1976 westy is acting up. Sometimes after a long period of driving...ie: 2 
hours or more my van will not start. Usually I am on the road for a few 
hours then stop to gas up. When I go to start again nothing. The motor does 
not turn, there is nothing. The batteries are fully charged. I can jump 
start the van and it will run fine. If i were to leave the van sit for 
awhile it would start after cooling down. I'm not really sure what to look 
for? Any sugestions? Any similar problems?

Matt
