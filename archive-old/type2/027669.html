HI All,

	I took my 70 Westy down for a sticker the other day. It failed
because one of the rear seatbelts, on the Z bed (I think it's called) was
not bolted down. I can not find where it is supposed to go. When lifting the
seat and looking into the area (facing rear of bus) There is one belt bolted
to the left, two in the middle, and I think the unattached one goes to the
right. but I cannot find the location. Is it hidden by the mechanism and
seat side? Any help would be appreciated. Additionally, does my 70 have a
steering damper? I looked under the bus but could not find it. I remember my
74 had one.

Thanks

Jeff
