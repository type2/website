Subject: [T2] extra battery wireing....

cant remember whom i talked with on this but help me here if you might..? thought i had saved the email but must of deleted it by accident...?
 
i have an extra battery.... as of now i am running this extra battery for my radio... each day chargeing it at night..... and sitting it back down in the passenger floor board the next morning.....
i was thinking that i can keep this battery charged all the time by the alternator as well as the one that is back in the cab with the engine.......
i will not at that time have my radio hooked to the spare battery but yet will have the radio hooked to the switch so that when i crank up the radio will be on...also must find a main source so that the clock and all will be right....and keep my stations....i am guessing this will be the same source as that of where the wire from the + battery post wil go as well? and the positve for the radio?
 
the spare battery is so that i can use it for cooking and lights and other accessories that i have in the bus...for camping and what nots....
 
ok i think i am right but cant remember 
 
something about hooking a wire from battery + to a source that is on when the bus is cranked or the switch comes on? which would this be.... in the fuses... and could i hook to a fuse...?
and then ground the battery with another wire...?to the bus frame or wherever i can get a good ground....?
 
dont want to fry nothing but really need to see this the extra battery thing work........?
 
 
i remember this being simple when i read it but some how since i havent been working in that area of the bus and i have made it difficult...~!~
 
thanks and peace
Chris
