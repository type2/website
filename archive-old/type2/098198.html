&gt; &gt; ...the one question still left in my mind is
&gt; why
&gt; VW says a 185R14R tire is best for a 1972
&gt; Camper and later and why a
&gt; commerical tire is best for 1973 and later
&gt; Station Wagon and Delivery
&gt; van.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that it is really a matter of differing
&gt; standards in Europe and
&gt; the US.  The tire requirements didn't change,
&gt; just the way that the
&gt; manuals interpreted the requirements.
&gt; 
I really don't believe that the tires standards
differ.  As best I can tell, the spec for the
185R14R (Reinforced) and 185R14C (Commercial)
have remained constant.  The Reinforced tires
always had a max pressure around 44 and the
Commercial tires were much higher. 

Perhaps the increased spec for the Commercial
tire related to the greater weight of the later
vans?  Or more lawsuits?  Who knows.  

FWIW I still don't agree with the &quot;trailer tire&quot;
posts regarding RD603V.  These are DOT certified
passenger cars with A ratings.  I'm not sure
where the highway rib= trailer tire thought
began, except that very few passenger tires made
in the last few decades do not have the all
season rating.  Personally I would insist on at
least M+S ratings, and would prefer an all
terrain tire.  Thus, I wouldn't favor the
Bridgestone or the Yoko, but lotsa folks prefer
the smooth ride and low noise of these highway
rib tires.  

Personally, I'm not interested in Agilis.  They
don't look like the have enough siping and voids
to be all season, but Michelin says they meet the
formula (it's a percentage of some sort).  All
the vanagon guys love Agilis, but maybe they're
just trying to prove they have more money.

I did not &quot;endorse&quot; Conti's by the way.  Rather,
I've never owned a set.  I just posted to the
list when they became available at tirerack due
to some (Doktor Tim, I believe) lamented that the
conti's were no longer available.  The conti's
will be one of my first choices the next time I'm
shopping for tires, along with the Cooper
SRMII/Mastercraft Courser R/D twins.
