A grease gun, that is.

To lube the shift rod tunnel and front torsion beams.

Before I go to the FLAPS, are there different sizes of ends to fit over that 
little grease...nipple?

Or are they all the same? And what grade or type grease should I get?


Thanks,
Jason, green behind the ears in a white 69 Westy.
