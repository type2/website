Subject: BA6: Vanagon Manual &amp; Relay Part #

I read in an article by Ron Van Ness that the Vanagon Bentley manual
contains some information on the BA6. Would someone out there with that
manual care to copy the pages related to the BA6 and send them to me? I'll
be happy to reimburse costs...and maybe share some heat one day when we
meet at a campout. 

Also, the manual at http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/images/VW-S12.02.jpg
shows a &quot;heater relay with ballast resistor for air circulation blower.&quot;
Does anyone know the part number for this resistor?

Also, I'd like to publicly thank Sami for hosting the BA6 pages. Without
these, I'd be really lost trying to figout out how to get this BA6 into my
'72 (which never had one).

Thanks! :) Joe
