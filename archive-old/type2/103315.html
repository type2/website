&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you are attempting to point out 
&gt;that Mobil-1 synthetic oil both:

Thank you, yes.  Or at least resists higher temperatures better.

&gt;        b) lubricates well even at these higher temps (what weight are you 
&gt;                running, anyway?)

Yes again, and 15W50 summer, 10W30 winter.

&gt;It would be worth noting that you are running a type-4 engine 

Yes, stock 2-liter with dual carbs.  Being in Texas, my engine is subjected to high ambient temps six months out of the year.  Fortunately, there aren't a lot of big hills, or it would run even hotter.  In the winter, it seldom goes over 200 degrees.
