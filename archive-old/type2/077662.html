Subject: Re: [T2] another emissions question


I belive the smaog pump was on 74 only. Spezial double groove crank pulley
as well. If Califonicadia requires the pump down there, there would be a
market if it is still functional (not likely). The stock Solex carbs are
worth a lot if the shafts aren't worn and the idle cut off threads aren't
bunged up. I saw on the web a place in England that sells the carbs new.
Haven't a clue where they get them, or what the site was. 

Throttle shafts can be rebushed for around $150 each with a complete
rebuild. Risk is you don't know how they will perform until you mount and
try to adjust them. Sometimes no matter how you clean them there is still a
little piece of grit somewhere that won't let go, and you will suffer
forever and never get clean running. A bit of risk here, more espezially if
they have been sitting for years on a hulk.

&gt;question..........I stopped the other day to look at a bus
&gt;72-76?maybe...sitting on the back of a car lot. The guy wanted $350.
&gt;bucks for it...motor was locked up and it was a little ruff...but it had
&gt;a smog pump on it and duel stock carbs.......are the smog pumps sought
&gt;after and at what value?  I feel the pump and carbs are worth the price
&gt;of the van....?/
