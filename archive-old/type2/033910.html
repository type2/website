regarding the foamy oil, water, etc.
 
Any moisture in the oil that is there in
significant amounts should disappear
if your oil is reaching operating temperature.
( I would assume, and I've been told by others)
 
Make sure you have your thermostat, esp in the 
winter.

I would also suggest hooking your crankcase
breather up to your air intake on the carbs.
That's the most &quot;stock&quot; place for it.  It will
also allow the engine to burn all the nastys
that come out of the valve....

we finally got snow today....yippee...
