Subject: low compression

I have just gotten done adjusting the valves on my 68 campmobile with a
1600 in it.  Much to my dismay this did not do much to raise the
compression in #3.  The compression in 1,2, and 4, all exceed 105psi right
now.  The thing that is confusing me is whether it is in need of new rings,
or new valves, or what.  I did put some oil in #3 and retested the
compression and found that it brought it up about 10 psi to about 70 or
so.However, this is still way too low, and I am not sure of what to do next
to identify what exactly is the problem.  I don't want to do a valve job
and have had it need new rings, or vice versa.  Unfortunately, money is a
limiting factor here, so I can only do what really needs to be done.  Also,
Muir says it may be that the exhaust valve is not seating properly, and he
would run diesel or Bardahl through the carb, run 1,000 miles and retest.
What exactly does he mean?  Also, if that is not the cure to my problem,
won't I be damaging the engine to run it 1,000 miles with bad compression
in #3?  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.
