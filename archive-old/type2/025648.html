&gt; Only to add more confusion, I'm getting flack from Mom and Dad.  Like I
&gt; said, it has rust.  The cab floor needs to be replaced.  So does half of the
&gt; back floor.  I got an estament...$400 dollar for labor alone.  &quot;No problem,&quot;
&gt; I thought, &quot;I'll take a welding class and an autobody class next semester at
&gt; the college.  Money saved and knowledge gained.  The flack?  Mom and Dad say,
&gt; &quot;Don't put any money into that thing...you'll never get it back!&quot;  If I do
&gt; all the work, it only needs about $1500...$2000 tops (and I think that's a
&gt; stretch).  Add to this what I paid for it, and the total is $2800.  Will I
&gt; have trouble getting that back?  To tell the truth, I don't plan on ever
&gt; selling it, I just want to appease the 'rents.

If it's a good running Bus that just needs a couple thousand to fix it up,
consider this: a good running low-rust recent-model van is going to run you
at least $5000. So let's see...five thousand (what the newer van would cost)
minus $2800 (what this one's going to run you)...sounds like you're getting
$2200 back right off the top! And you'll be able to fix this van with common
hand tools.
