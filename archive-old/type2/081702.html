Subject: Re: [T2] I have a clutch problem two.

No, it sounds like you have a bad pressure plate and it is not traveling
enough to release the disc, even though the amount of pedal and throw-out
bearing travel is correct.
Been there-done that on my daughters 77 Westy 2.0. I went crazy trying to
figure out what was going wrong. R &amp; R'd the engine, looked at everything
twice, replaced the disc, did not see anything wrong. Put it all back
together. Still had the intermittant 'can not get it into 1st or reverse'
problem. R&amp;R'd the engine again. Took the pressure plate to my FLAPS and laid
it on the counter next to a new one. The fingers on the new one stood up
higher. There was a gap between the fingers and the edge of the center circle
of the cover that was not on the new one. The fingers touched on the new one.
Put the new one in and all the problems were gone.



&gt; I am also having a problem with my clutch in my 74. I
&gt; just had a 1.8 installed and when I push the clutch in
&gt; all of the way it doesn;t engage all of the way. I'm
&gt; not sure if the engine came out of another 74 or a 75.
&gt; Does this sound like a mismatched flywheel and stuff?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tyler
