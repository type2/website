Subject: 74 Bug and 74 Bus for sale or parts
Date: Sun, 08 Nov 1998 02:07:19 PST

Hey Y'all,
  I have a 74 Bus with no motor (BTW Randy E-mail me you left some stuff 
here)
It has a trans and a good back seat and a fair body with little rust. 
This is mainly a parts Bus but could run again if motivated. Has inop 
sunroof.
  The 74 Bug is fair minus the motor. The body has good fenders and hood 
in front and good glass. pan is rusty(aren't they all) and the engine 
cover is good. The rear fenders are not perfect and the nose has been 
repaired from a wreak and the work was poorly done. It has Sport Bug 
wheels. The interior is ugly,trans is good. This was my daily driver and 
was going to be a baja. I have a Baja kit and exhaust for it. I will 
sell it all or parts. I have a motor but it is not running and is about 
80% complete. It needs Alt stand( it has Alt) and some tin other wise 
complete.
   I need to get this stuff out of my yard and will let it go very 
cheap. I will trade for a Trans for a 68-72 bus also. Just make me an 
offer or tell me what you have to trade, I need some Bus(68-72) bumpers 
any condition. Also need a 68-70 Bus wheel. You can call me # is below.
