Subject: Re: Rattle can epoxy primer

A paint that contains high solids made up of epoxy resin qualifies for the 
name &quot;epoxy coating.&quot;

The paint can use high flash naptha as the vehicle for the solids, if it is 
brushed. Probably xylene if it is sprayed.

Such a paint would have to be advertised as &quot;one-part epoxy.&quot; ( As compared 
with 2-part epoxy coatings.)

Here is an example:

Just because almost everyone assumes &quot;epoxy&quot; to mean a 2-part system 
doesn't exclude use of the word &quot;epoxy&quot; in the name of the 
coating.......although it does open the way for assumptions and 
misunderstandings.
