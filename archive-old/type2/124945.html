Subject: brake booster hose

I went to a Farm tractor repair shop and bought a piece of high pressure
hydraulic line. The vacuum booster hose does not have to be high inside
pressure,
it has to be able to hold an inside vacuum and not be crushed by the outside
atmospheric pressure when it is under vacuum and &quot;empty&quot; inside.

The high pressure hydraulic line holds vacuum just fine. It has a
reinforcing stiff wire braid that keeps it from exploding under high inside
pressure or from collapsing under vacuum. I had to take some of the vacuum
fittings with me to get the correct inside diameter. And then afterwords, I
used double hose clamps on each fitting.
