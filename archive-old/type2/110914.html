Subject: Re: [T2] Colour Sanding 

Hello,

That have a certain tool that is sold at finer auto
body finish stores made to remove runs in hardened
paint. It has been a while since I saw one but it has
a small blade in it which you use to cut the run mark
down to the level of the rest of the paint. It works
like a miniture hand plane. You then water sand and
buff. If you have a bad run and start sanding without
removing most of the run first, it is easy to sand
right through the paint. I don't know if it is worth
the trouble to try and locate one at your local auto
paint store or not. Either way, good luck!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; So I finished painting the inside of my bus last
&gt; weekend and it looks .... OK.- there are
&gt; only two runs but one of them is on the dash. So
&gt; what to do ... One guy I
&gt; spoke to said sand em out and shot those spots
&gt; again.  Someone else said I
&gt; should wet sand the runs and buff it out.  I'm
&gt; inclined to wet sand and buff
&gt; because I think I would be able to even out the
&gt; paint a bit &gt;
