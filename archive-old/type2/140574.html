Subject: Re: [T2] timing

From Richard Atwell:
Jim wrote,
 it's interesting
to note that in 74 they did away with the cut-off two-way vacuum valve
and still required the 10 degrees ATDC (depending if the engine was
1700 or 1800, Calif or Federal (etc.) and it gets real confusing in
that time period).

And Richard replied,
 Which really makes me wonder what worth it has at all.

I've driven a 72 bus with and without it connected and the engine was dog
slow with it connected. I've read the description of it is in Bentley on
page 73 of Engine and Clutch and I can't think of a reason to disable the
vacuum advance for the lower 3 gears.

Looking back over the receipts for that bus that the PO was so careful to
keep, they purchased the bus on 10/30/72 and had to be taken in for service
7/1/74 (only 20 months later) at 8,633 miles when the owner complained that
the engine ran poorly when hot. I'd like to draw the conclusion that the a/c
unit intallation butchery to the engine seal and vacuum advance cutoff were
to blame but who knows...

 What engine doesn't need a little extra advance at partial throttle? It
would seem to do more harm than good to leave it connected.

Richard,
That last sentence has me very confused......
Did you mean to say 'dis' connected??

Back in the early 70's, as part of the Calif smog program, we had to either disconnect the vacuum advance or
install a more expensive device on that would regulate the vacuum advance.*

This was on 66 to 70 cars. Most 1970 GM cars were exempt because they already had TCS. TCS means Transmission
Controlled Spark. Vacuum advance was shutoff until the trans got into the highest gear, 3rd or 4th depending
on the trans. The cheap kit that got you by because of the $40 max you legally pay consisted of 2 rubber caps
and a sticker to put on the speedo! The high dollar unit was made by Pure Power and it was rpm controlled to
cut off vacuum.
If you find a 66-70 Calif car with its original windshield, it may still have the blue [for Passed] or red
[for Exempt] NOx sticker on the bottom right corner.
The * was for VW's. Since they ran vacuum only distributors, you cannot cancel vacuum advance.
[Although I did see alot that were done by incompetent smog techs!]
For VW's, you had to install an EGR valve. You had to drill a hole in the heat risor, screw in a pipe, screw
on a valve, r&amp;r the carb, put in 2 longer studs, install a spacer plate, and then a hose between the plate and
the valve. The valve was tee'd into the vac advance hose. This was called an STP device...... Made by Grancor.
[for 10 bonus points, What name is associated with STP? If you guessed Andy Granatelli...... ding, you win!
Does the company name now make sense? Granatelli Corporation]  [I have person to person experience with that
short fat greaseball, but that is for another day....]

All in the name of lowering combustion temps to stop the manufacture of Oxides of Nitrogen [NOX].  I never did
understand why cutting power and efficiency and mileage and increasing CO and HC was better than a little
NOx.....but, what do I know?. I just have to fix their screwups.
I believe I still have both booklets of stickers!
