&gt; &gt; * This older multiple lead socket that hooked up to a VWAG diagnostic
&gt; computer:
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, Richard.  I've got one of these, but this particular one is about
&gt; 6-7 inches long, mounted vertically, to the front of the battery
&gt; compartment, just to the right of the arm that use to hold the FI stuff (?).
&gt; 
&gt; Looks as if it has at least 15 to 30 (can't see both sides of the slot in
&gt; it) contacts, and seems to have a socket at the bottom to hold one end of a
&gt; connector, and a clip thing at the top to secure it.

you see the end of the electronic control unit for the fuel injection
system, it is inside the sidewall of the bus with only the end sticking
out, the plug is exactly as you describe it.
