Hi Glen,

If it looks stock *most* people probably won't touch it. You're already at
risk from the other kind of people, they're the one's that will slash your
tires or steal your gas-cap; both of which have happened to my bus right in
my own driveway. :^(

I put some nifty magnetic vinyl maple leaves on my bus, and no-one messed
with them from from mid-August to early November. ;^)

Have a look-see at:

Now I think I'll see about getting another piece of that stuff.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; During one of the many desperate discussions on bus
&gt; heating, a list member passed along the tip to put a
&gt; strip of magnetic sign material over the front grill
&gt; on the bread loaf to block Ol' Man Winter's icy
&gt; fingers.
&gt; 
&gt; A stroke of genius.
&gt; 
&gt; I stopped at one of those quick sign places and they
&gt; cut me a 5.5&quot;x36&quot; piece of gloss white magnetic
&gt; material and even rounded the corners for $13.
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like it's a permanent modification. (My only
&gt; fear is some #$_at_&amp;!&amp; will rip it off in a parking lot.)
