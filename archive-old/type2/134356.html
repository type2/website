Subject: RE: [T2] dashboard clock

Generally speaking, what prices (all things relative) have listees seen in
the States for late bay clocks?  working?  or the more common non-working
variety?  Were there any distinguishing characteristics between the clocks
put in the late bay window buses vs. the early bay window buses?  I know
that they have always had a bad reputation, and I've been told that
reputation is well earned.  Screen shots anyone?, links?  I have seen lots
of the clocks from earlier VW types and makes, but not too many from a late
bay window.

What is the most creative use for the third dash pod typically left empty
because VW was selling such unreliable clocks?  I have seen some odd stuff,
creative, but none of it done very well.  And yes, I know that the best use
for the third pod is to actually put a clock or gauge in there, but I'm
thinking creative, entertaining things that you normally don't see.
Anything really bizarre like a shrunken head would be most believable if
accompanied with screen shots.  :)
