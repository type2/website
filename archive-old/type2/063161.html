&gt;I got around to attempting to install my rear KYB's. The old shock

&gt;if it was the origonal. So anyway, here is my quandry. The 
&gt;bolt that holds th top of the shock gets wider where the threads
&gt;end as you get closer to the head. In the origonal shock it fit
&gt;into the rubber bushing on the shock. On the KYB it will not
&gt;go through. Can I just go and get a bolt that will go through
&gt;from the local hardware store? It appears that the origonal
&gt;shock mounted snug against the body, and that this would be
&gt;ok. Any thoughts??????? TIA
Are you sure that isn't a sleeve toward the head end of the bolt?  The shock
usually has a metal sleeve inside the rubber bushing, that the bolt passes
through.  Sometimes it rusts to the bolt, and looks like one piece.  If this
is the case, you should be able to remove the sleeve from the bolt by vice
grips or driving/pressing the bolt out.
