&gt;    
&gt;    1968 VW bus.
&gt;    1600 cc single-port VW engine.
&gt;    Gas Heater.
&gt;    Power assist defroster.
&gt;    Good tires.
&gt;    Just re-did the front seats and seat belts.
&gt;    Needs paint but the body's in fairly good shape for it's age. A
&gt;       little putty, but not much rust.
&gt;    
&gt;    The engine died and I really don't have time to work on it.  I'd
&gt;    like to get something else.  It either broke the cam or a tappet. 
&gt;    I have an extra dual-port long block that also needs rebuilt that
&gt;    I'll throw in.
&gt;    
&gt;    $2k
&gt;
