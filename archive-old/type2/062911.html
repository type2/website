That's interesting. The odd thing, locally, is that there are FAR more 
68-72 busses running around than all the pre-68s combined. In the last 
year, I haven't seen a single pre-68 in the paper, but numerous VWs in 
the later range. It's not uncommon to see them listed as excellent 
condition, rebuilt engines, and even some campers... in the $650 to 
$1500 price range. It's our own fault. The going rate for the classic VW 
was under $2000, with most selling for half that.

It has me wondering... how hard would it be to graft on a split front 
end? &lt;grin&gt;
