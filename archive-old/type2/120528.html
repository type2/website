Subject: Re: [T2] CHEEP BUSES

well i got mine under 1000 bucks and have put well over 5000 in to it and she still didnt drive ;;;; cause she still had a bad motor even after all the parts i put on it....also.....
now to add of the parts that i have been given... or was given to in a deal......,or even the help that i have recieved for my bus....well thats kinda like priceless,,,.,.
i will admit that i have at times came to sale my bus but could never come right out and say it..... i would always walk away for a bit....
haveing and owning a bus was a dream of mine as a boy.....
that would be like giving up and throwing my dreams away.....
shoot its paid for and each time i drive it all that labor and love i get back out of her.,.,. you know they carry there own spirit dont you ?.,., and as far as a community... well bus peoples have there own community.,.,.,.i have never met people that were so kynd,,.,.
they are as unique as the buses they drive....
peace to you all and yours,,.
