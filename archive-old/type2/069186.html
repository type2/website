Subject: RE: Kombi definition w/insurance ?

On my policy for my 75 Campmobile it lists my van a being a Kombi under
the area of Model.  Is this a generic term or should I be negotiating a
different rate.  I told them I use my van for recreation and that I only put
on about 5,000 miles a year. Which is correct until I take it across country
this summer. I pay approximately $400 a year for the most basic
coverage with State Farm. I also insure an 86 Golf on this policy for an
additional $500.  I priced my insurance with other companies and got a
similar response.  Any recommendations or is all of this relative? Kombi
vs Camper?
