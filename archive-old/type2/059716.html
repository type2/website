Subject: 71 won't start

Listees:
OK, here's the problem. 
My 71 had some light problems so I got in, replaced a fuse and untangled the mess of wiring the PO had left.  Got the lights 
working great then went to start. No go. I think I must have messed up the ignition. The lights don't come on (oil, battery, 
etc) in the instrument cluster or anything. Basically the ignition system is not powering up. Furthermore, the key will not 
turn to the crank position. Just turns to the ignition position and comes to a hard stop. I hot wired the start and it cranks 
fine but of course won't start because ignition is out. Am I reading this right? Is there a fuse or wire or ground to check. 
I've got the wiring diagram here from Bentley but can't figure out which one to check? Help!
