Subject: Digital temp sender at Costco

I was just at Costco and noticed that they had a digital thermometer for 
barbecues that looked like it would work pretty well as an oil (or other) 
temp sender.  It was $29 and has a probe with attached braided steel wire 
that was about 3 feet long (would looks like it would fit down the dipstick 
tube) which goes to a control/readout unit.  The really cool thing is that 
this kit comes with an additional, wireless remote digital readout 
unit!  So you could mount the whole thing in your engine compartment and 
put the wireless remote up front on the dash somewhere.  I'm tempted to try 
it even though I already have temp gauges.  For those who have a Costco 
membership, you might want to check it out.
