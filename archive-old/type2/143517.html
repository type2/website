Subject: Re: [T2] Murphy and I did battle!

Bob.....I think I remember reading somewhere  that Pertronix likes a higher 
output
coil.  Maybe if you are still running with an original Bosch coil it is a 
little weaker
than Pertronix likes.  Pertronix makes a coil that claims to be higher 
voltage.....
