Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

I think I have another one from radio shack that's a tiny little thing..
wallet sized.. you might want to check if they have them.  It uses
button cells and tests resistance and continuity (beeps).  It also does
voltage.  That's all you need it for with a bus.  Probably 30 bux like
Sean's.. or maybe even the same one..

later,
Mike

&gt; I got a nice general purpose multi-meter (volts, ohms, amps) at Radio Shack
&gt; several years ago for something like $30 or so, and it's worked just fine.
&gt; It has nice long leads, a small, swing-out wire &quot;stand&quot; that allows me to
&gt; set it upright, and a large, clear readout that's easy to see.
&gt; 
&gt; I use it once or twice a year on my '81, I'm careful with it (no greasy
&gt; hands, no dropping down into the engine, etc.) and I expect it'll last as
&gt; long as I care to use it.
&gt; 
&gt; You can spend a heck of a lot more for these items, but unless you're using
&gt; a multi-meter every day, why bother?

&gt; Subject: [T2] Which meter to buy
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well I want to buy a meter (Ohm/ammeter ?) to help troubleshoot problems I
&gt; &gt; might have with FI, wiring, instruments, AFM, ECU. Does anyone have any
&gt; &gt; preferences/suggestions on which one to get? Please explain why you prefer
&gt; &gt; it (sorry, I want the reason why you like it too). This will be for my
&gt; 1980
&gt; &gt; Westy primarily.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was looking at some nice units at a new Checker Auto Parts just down the
&gt; &gt; street.
