Subject: [T2] front top of camper

does anyone know who much the front part of the camper top would cost
(the small fiberglass cap on the front top of a westy)
MY local VW mechanic  has one that I want to buy, but he does not
know how much it's worth, I told him I would find out and make
him a reasonable offer.

thanks
