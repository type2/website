Subject: PLFVW Kill It

Hello all,

Please kill the PLFVW thread.  It started out nice enough with actual
content that we might care about but now it has become crap.  

Mike Hineline, don't you dare unsub, or I will put you back on the list
myself :-)

I take a dim view of flaming e-mails from listmembers, even if private.
Mike, give me a name and a copy of the message and we'll see what we can
do about removing this person from our community.  We don't need that.

Now let's let this thread die before it degenerates further.
