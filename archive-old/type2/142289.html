Subject: Double cab with single cab bed

Several years ago I remember seeing a double cab on Ebay that had a single cab
bed on it. So it was like a double cab with a long bed. I assume this was a
custom build, has anyone ever seen this? Maybe a picture or a link to a
webpage about it? Maybe I dreamed it??

Thanks,
Corbett
