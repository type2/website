&gt;Typical of original 73 dual carbs is throttle shaft wear that allows excess

They were used on the 2000 motors in Europe for years so the proper jets
should be readily available if one knew what they were.  I would still like
to hear from someone who knows what the stock jet sizes were for these
carbs on the 2-liter engines.  In the absence of this knowledge I am
running 132.5 mains, 155 air correction and 55 idle jet on my 2-liter and
it runs well - a tad rich here at 2500 ft elevation but I like it that way.

Don't be too quick to blame throttle body wear for things like backfiring -
it's true that the shaft bores do tend to wear on these carbs but you would
be suprised how much wear can be present and still have an engine that runs
strong, idles smoothly and does not backfire.  The real problem is likely
somewhere else, IMHO as always.
