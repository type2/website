My Husband uses a sharpened stub pencil.  Fits just right into the end

&gt; I have a plastic bolt (actually a &quot;license plate&quot; bolt from a license
&gt; plate mounting kit, I think) that I use when changing fuel filters.
&gt; I just screw the little bolt into the fuel line to stop the gas
&gt; dribble, and then pull it out when I am ready to jam the new filter
&gt; into the line.
