Subject: Need Intake Manifold Data on 1971 Bus Engine

I just bought a 73 bug engine to put in my 71 Westy and need some 
information from someone with a 71 bus that has the stock manifold.  I  need 
to put a tap in the intake manifold for the brake servo vacuum line.  I 
would really appreciate having someone tell me how far down from the carb 
flange the servo tap is located and the inside diameter of the tap.

Thanks,

Andrew Stockton
