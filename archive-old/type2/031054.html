&gt; David, even as early as '68, lights are pretty interwoven into the electrical system--that is, a problem on one end of the system may impact a seemingly unrelated part of the system. I suspect your problem may well be caused by the faulty headlight relay. I would recommend not tearing into the dash until you have a chance to check that. 

if that ain't the truth, remember I was having problems with the turn
signals and the gen light,  turns out the last fuse on the right (1 or 12
forget which) was loose!  tighten the fuse the problem goes away.   only
took 2 years of pulling my hair out to find this intermittent problem ;8*{
