&gt; Since we're on the subject of tunes in da Bus...
&gt;
&gt; I have been pondering how to get some decent speakers in the Westy

&gt; The real problem is where to place speakers with decent bass response.


maybe I'm a little dense, or just tone deaf, but putting decent speakers
in a bus is kinda like putting em in a big empty tin can, the bus would
need about 500lbs of sound deading materiel for it to make much
difference.  listen to NPR or talk radio on the tinny speaker and tune
into the sound of the flat four singing in the back
