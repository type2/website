Subject: ohio roadtrip report

Well, i'm pleased to announce that i'm back and in one piece, but more
importantly, so is the VW. and we only went through 2 tires and 1 jack.

Most of sunday we spent fixin' up Cricket. Rewiring weird wires, changing
bulbs and stuff like that. Leaving early Monday morning, everything was
running and going fine. it was a Beautiful trip out there, most of early
morning we drove through rain and fog though, but when the sun came up we
were driving through West Virginia and into Ohio and it was Absolutely
Gorgeous. I was thinking that everyone was giving West VA a bad rap,
seemed perfectly fine to me. So we drove to Cincinnati and spent the rest
of the day at Kings Island. Home to the longest roller coaster. now one
of my personal favorites. :) When trying to leave to go home to the
campground, She wouldn't start, which was not suprising, because when she
runs for a long time, she won't start, unless you climb under and bang on
the starter, or push start it. So we opted for that, when two nice guys
in a car pulled up to see if we needed any help pointed out we had a
flat. Meanwhile probably looking like idiots due to the fact that we were
pushing this van and Hadn't realize we had a flat. so we stopped to look.
pulled out the spare, and the jack (1 of 2) and began to fix it. after
fighting with the hubcap pins or prongs, whatever they're called, and
fighting with the Jack to fit in the slot we were doin' okay. Until it
was made VERY obvious to us that we sorta forgot to put on the emergency
brake. oops. $^%_at_! had to bang that jack outa there. one jack down. one
to go...Emergency brake ON!!! fixed that. all good. camped at a nice
little place called Cedar Brook in Bethlehem OH? i think... ;) Very nice
people. not to crowded either. then in the morning we stopped at a gas
station for, well the obvious, but also we patched the tire with an old
kit that Dave had lying around. Then we headed up to Sandusky for 2 days
at Cedar Point (americas Roller Coast... ;) about 40 miles down the
road...Wappa WHappa WHAppa. OOps. there goes the tread! no problem, pull
over on the nice newly re-paved highway and change it, again. this time
making sure the emergency brake was on. At this point i was watchin' out
for the cars and really hoping one of y'all would actually show up, like
my early posting said. sadly, no. In fact, i don't know if anyone else
has noticed this, but i didn't see very many Vintage VWs at all. very
odd. anyway, on to cedar point, where things went on without incident.
had a Great time there. Rode the Magnum 3 times and the new power tower 1
in each direction, up and down. :) :D Then on Thursday, we sorta started
to meander on home, very slowly, stoping at this and that. We stopped at
this little group of stores called the Amish Door. If anyone is up in
that area and knows where it is, or you ever pass it in any adventuring,
stop in to this store called AlpenStock. Real nice guy who owns it. and
carved the sign out front to. outta teak. (&quot;not to brag&quot; ;) he really was
a real nice guy  :) but they have a food store where you can buy things
in semi-bulk. like at the PA Dutch markets. and i swear this is the best
thing i've seen in years, they sell the little crunchy marshmellows like
in Lucky charms and Hot chocolate. :) i didn't think life could be sooo
good. :) We also stopped in Milan, OH, home town to boy genious and
&quot;Americas most useful citizen&quot; Thomas edison. stopped at the historical
museum (they have a whole block of redone houses) and on our way from
there to the Invention Cafe for lunch, we pulled a little business card
with a note scrawled on the back, off of the windshield from an &quot;engine
Hobbyist&quot; from the area who really liked our van. That was good..i think
it just made the trip. That bus gets more attention than anything i've
ever seen. People are almost always real nice to us, and of course,
flashing the occasional good humoured peace sign as they pass by. I think
it's just a Feel-good vehicle. it just makes you smile and feel warm when
you look at one. We got an offer to trade Cricket for all the contents of
a yard sale we stopped at. Umm...let me think about this one....NO.
*Grin* While driving home on route 68 i believe, and desperatly searching
for a White Castle to try, as neither Dave or myself have actually eaten
at one, we passed a mostly blue Bus packed to the hilt  we beeped waved
and drove buy. They were very excited as well and waved enthusiastically
back (if that wasn't a word before, it is now.) after stopping for a
while somewhere, we passed them again. this time pausing, or at least
driving right next to each other to talk. They were going up to NYC,
probably to school i guess. there we lots of rubbermaid containers
strapped to the top :) it's looked REALLY amusing. They were spending the
night in DC though, which is sorta where we would of been going if we
hadn't come home to my house in annapolis. So that was the end of our
friendship with them, but while we went zooming off again, they snapped a
photo, was hoping to do the same, but we were a little faster then them
;) We arrived home around 9 at night, unpacked the food and assorted
stuff we had accumlated and collected. and Slept Hard! :) I really don't
think i've had that much fun in a while. taking photos of random things,
making fun of the ohio billboards :) Oh, and word of warning, before i
forget. Do not Ever take the back roads out of WVA. Scenic yes, but it's
all very very repetitive. it's like the old movie trick where the actors
sat in a car and the repeating scene scrolled past. :P blech. no offense
to people living there. It's just a Very Sketchy way to go home. 
	So yes, i had an extraordinarily wonderfull time, and it's
Definetly something i'll be doing again. especially since i found out
that the crayola factory in PA gives tours. ;) And if you're ever in
Sandusky, check out the Merry-Go-Round museum. :) it's something everyone
should see.

Until next time, 
whenever it may be.
