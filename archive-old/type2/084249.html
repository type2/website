&gt; &gt;    Hey Friends,   Sad news came to town yesterday.  Tues  evening Glen,
&gt; &gt;the brewmaster at the wild duck was killed in a tragic  accident.  The man
&gt; &gt;who brought you Spankdog, Sasquatch, Glen's Special  Bitter that fabulous
&gt; &gt;Russian Imperial Stout and many other fine brews is no  longer with us.
&gt; &gt;There was a shrine set up and bitter flowing yesterday at  the WD.
&gt; &gt;Thought you might want to stop by the Duck and have a beer for  Glen.
&gt; &gt;For those Volkswagen owners among  us.....please, please be careful
&gt; &gt;climbing under your bus with a screwdriver  heading for the starter.
&gt; &gt;It's a great day to be alive!   Rex

About 20 years ago I remember reading that the Playmate of the month claimed the same thing
happened to her as she was fixing to go to the photo shoot.  The implication was that the
extra chest padding saved her life.  Personally, I hope if I'm ever too drunk to forget to put
the vehicle in neutral before crawling underneath someone will take the keys away from me
first.

Larry
