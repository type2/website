Subject: Question for Canadian list members

As some of you know, our order desk's toll-free number regrettably does not
work from Canada (due to the exhorbitant surcharge MCI wants to levy if we
make it otherwise). However, I've been looking at using VOIP
(voice-over-internet-protocol) for some of our outbound dialing, and one
Canadian-based provider says they can offer us a Toronto (area code 416)
exchange at a very low cost. Basically I'd have to set up a stand-alone
phone with its own phone line at the shop just for calls that came in on
that number.

My question, to those living outside of Ontario, is whether this would be
beneficial to people throughout Canada, or useful only to those living near
Toronto. In other words, if you lived in, say, Quebec, would it cost you
significantly less to dial a Toronto phone number than if you just called
Pennsylvania directly?  I just don't know how Canadian phone service is
billed.

Given that VOIP quality through a second-tier provider may potentially be
inconsistent/unreliable compared to standard landline service, it would seem
silly to even bother doing this if it would only save Canadians a couple of
cents a minute anyway (unless they happen to live near Quebec). But on the
other hand, if it would represent a real benefit to Canadian list members, I
might be able to make it happen.

No need to reply on-list; just email me directly.

Thanks for your feedback.
