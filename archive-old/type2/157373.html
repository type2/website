Subject: RE: [T2] Brake squishyness

Regarding the lack of full return: IIRC, the master
cylinder cannot physically restrain the actuating rod
from the pedal/booster when the rod returns
itself...so I think you have a mechanical problem with
the pedal, linkage, or booster. Lack of lube?
Broken/worn pedal spring? Bad booster?

Regarding the soft braking:

1.  I have a 77, but I doubt a 70 is much different...
I would expect to use several small bottles, or maybe
one big bottle of fluid.

2. I doubt the ramp would make much difference, but
generally you want the vehicle flat when bleeding. 
You might have trapped a bubble in the master cyl?

3. I would definitely try bleeding it again. Reference
the manual and make sure you do it in the correct
order.  Also, if you didn't the first time you should
have a helper to push the pedal...those one-man
brake-bleeder check valve thingies suck.

If that doesn't work, check out the master cyclinder.
(they are pretty cheap at the FLAPS).  




&lt;SNIP&gt;

1) How much brake fluid should I need to replace the
fluid in the
entire braking system?

2) Can the rear brakes be correctly bled with the back
end up on ramps?

3) Any thoughts on the lack of full return and
squishness on the pedal.
