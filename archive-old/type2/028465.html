Hi Jake,

Doh! I stand corrected on the case alloy.  I mistakenly thought I remembered
reading that the old T1 cases (AS41...not a rebuildable material according
to Berg) were replaced in '75 by AS21, a much stronger material and the same
as T4.  You are right it's not the same. So what is the designation of the
T4 case material?  You are cutting thru &quot;butter&quot; on the AS41.

Remember...I was comparing a T1-tm to a *stock* T4.  You turned it into
T4-tm vs. T1-tm. That was not the discussion. No argument the T4 is a beasty
animal and better suited to performance mods, if that's what you're after.
I'm after the longest-lived T1-tm engine, yet I fully respect the elegance
of the T4 as well.

I've already exceeded twice your expectations on my Bus engine for
longevity...no valve job yet.  Are you saying your T1 rebuilds in Buses get
only 40K?  Hmmm.  Maybe I know a secret or two?  As you well know, the best
parts in a poorly assembled engine will not last long.  20 guys with the
same parts will all build very different motors. How many of those junkyard
motors you mentioned were built as I described?  I hate to say it but you
are comparing apples and oranges...just as I would be doing if I said a T1
could be anything a T4 can be.  At greater displacements the gap increases
between the two...T4 being the clear winner.

If you stick to the contents of the previous post I'd be happy to discuss
this further.  I stand corrected only on the case topic and am talking about
stock T4 and T1-tm.

Peace man,

Steve Trembley

Steve,
The type 1 case is far from the same alloy as a type 4! The type 1 case is
msostly magnesium, the type 4 case is pure aluminum alloy. When milling a
type 1 case, that boring bar cuts through the type 1 case like hot butter,
if you mill on a type 4, be prepared to change /sharpen the cutter head
after each spigot opening,

A good built type 4 will have that counterweight crank, and maybe even type
1 rod journals, and the same rods that you have in the type 1.
