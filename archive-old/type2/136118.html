Thanks Dave...
I have been thinking about propping the flap open but wasnt sure
what the effect would be... thanks! I am going to go ahead and
do it.

--- 
&gt; I adjusted it so that almost all of the air in the winter time came
&gt; only 
&gt; thru the preheat tubes....sure helped a lot!
&gt; 
&gt; It might have been gasping for air a little bit, but the heated air
&gt; sure 
&gt; made a difference!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave
