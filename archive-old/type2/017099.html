&gt; The Yokohamas have a higher load range (D) than the Michelins and have a

&gt; more aggressive tread pattern like the Yokohamas. One of the other major
&gt; items is costs. There again, the Yokohamas are less money making them more
&gt; cost agreeable for me.

     I went to Sears yesterday to check out  the Yokohamas, but they
didn't have any of the Y370's in stock. Looking in their book, I don't
see any LT rating on the Y370's, although the load rating for them is
more than adequate (like 1874 for the 225/75-15 I wanted for the rear
and only slightly lower for the 205s for the front). My question is: Are
these truly stiff enough in the sidewall, and can I run them at 48lbs
pressure?
