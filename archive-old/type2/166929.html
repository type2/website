Subject: Re: [T2] rear latch on sliding door

--- Trey Jung wrote:

 Lately the rear latch has been getting harder to
 close. the latch just
 doesn't seem to want to cooperate. By that I mean I
 have to give the handle a
 &quot;firm&quot; yank to close the latch by pulling up on the
 handle after the door has
 been closed.
 
 The door lines up well , no gaps anywhere, it just
 seems that this might be a maintenance issue.
 
 Any ideas on adjusting this? is this an adjustment
 on the inside of the door?

Have you lubricated the pivot points?

Have you read the owners manual where it says you are
supposed to raise the handle to pull it in?
