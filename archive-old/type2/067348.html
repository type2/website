Subject: Vanagon heat shield?

I made a trip out to Jim Ellis VW in Atlanta today to see if I could still
buy all the various grommets, boots and any other seals etc that I'm missing
from my engine compartment. First time that I've seen a parts fiche which the
counter man let me peruse and point out missing items. I id'ed a half dozen
items which cost a $20 bill and a weeks wait to come from Jacksonville, Fl.
Hopefully plugging the holes will make a significant difference.

Anyway, the reason for writing is that while studying the diagrams, I noticed
something that looked like a narrow shelf over the muffler and under the tin.
The parts guy guessed that it may have been a heat shield protecting the
engine tin from the muffler heat. I don't have it but then I have none of the
original equipment beyond the heater boxes. Was that the purpose of this
piece and if so, would it aid cooling to rig a shield over the muffler?

Thanks,

Weston
