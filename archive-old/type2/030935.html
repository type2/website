&gt; On the top, front, left half of my crank is what appears to be a

crank??? or case???  

&gt; flywheel inspection hole, roughly an inch and a quarter in diameter.
&gt; Should this hole be plugged with something?

if you are referring to the case this hole is for attaching the torque
converter to the flex plate on an automatic version. (it allows access to
the bolts) if you have a stick shift it is &quot;just there&quot; it can be ignored.

if in the crankshaft, seek help!
