Subject: gearshift \ 73 bus

Hi All,
  Now that Karen's 77 bus is finally fixed, my own 73 starts to act 
up. What happened was that shifting gears suddenly got a lot harder. 
This was not a gradual thing, it happened from 1 moment to the next. 
Before, gears would click in with almost no effort. Then suddenly it 
took much more force and you couldn't fell 'em &quot;click&quot; in place any 
more, if you know what I mean. Any suggestions on how to fix this? Or 
should I better leave it alone? Anything in particular that requires 
grease? And, if I have to take apart the gearshift assembly, are 
there any special tools or parts  I should get in advance, because they may need to be 
replaced? I could easily wait awhile before I attack this thing, but 
once I have a go at it, I can't let the bus sit in the driveway for days, it's my only 
transport, and I drive 1000 miles every other week...
  ANY input would be appreciated. Don't desert your turkey though. 
This is NO emergency...
  Ciao,
                  Gregor
