Subject: Re: [T2] heater cable replacement problem

Good Call Howard!

I ended up doing a similar thing. It was messy, tedious, but did the trick.
I also am going to drill a few small drain holes in the low portions on the
conduit, as water had basically filled them despite the rubber boot on the
end of the cable.

I connected both heater cables to the Heat lever as shown in the fiche (
http://www.bugbits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t205810.gif ),  and it works
well, actuating both flaps. I am still confused as to how the defrost/heat
system is supposed to be set up, however. In the fiche, it appears that
there should be at least one more cable, yet I can find no listing at any
FLAPS. Can anybody describe to me how this is supposed to work?

Thanks!

Cheers,
Matthew

   Why not clean the crud out by drilling out the cable housing, and fix the
problem? Take the old cable, and flatten one end by laying it on a flat hard
surface, like a vice. Then hit it with a hammer till you have a nice flat
1/4 inch wide end. Chuck the other end in a drill, and slowly feed it in the
housing while drilling, spraying with WD 40 from time to time.
    When the housing is clear, be sure and grease the new cable to prevent
it from happening again.
