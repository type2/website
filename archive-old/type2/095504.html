Subject: 70 Sunroof Deluxe Bus F/S

  Tommy got a new bus and needs to sell his 70 Daily Driver Deluxe to apease
his wife. It's a white over baby blue 1970 Hardtop Deluxe. This bus is in
excellent condition for a daily driver and would make someone a great ride.
I have busavaned to Cali with Tommy and it cruises nicely at 65 -70 mph and
gets way over 20 mpg at freeway speeds. Open the sunroof and watch the
stars. Has all seats and is very clean. He is ASKING $3500.00 dollars for
it. 
  His NEW bus 1961 Westy (if you have a August 93 Hot VW's there is a 3 page
spread on it.) and it IS Beautiful, it should be delivered here in Havasu
this Sunday and he needs the room.
