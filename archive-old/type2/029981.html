If you're referring to the infamous &quot;Selective Availability,&quot; that was
turned off some months ago by presidential order.  Civilian GPS units are
now accurate to within 10 feet or so horizontally.  They don't seem to be
quite as accurate vertically, but I think that this is an artifact of
their &quot;SA-era&quot; software, not the accuracy of the signal.

&gt; More expensive units can only be
&gt; more accurate up until a certain point so the cheap ones may serve your
&gt; purpose adequately, or the ones that piggy back on palm devices (cool
&gt; gizmos those are) Personally i like the low tech aspect of my bus love
&gt; those analog gauges , spending hours everyday pouring over spatial
&gt; models makes me appreciate not having yet another digital map in front
&gt; of me. but you can't beat them when you are lost!

I like the simplicity aspect too, but having one gadget that does so many
navigation functions is a wonderful thing!  Several times &quot;the box&quot; has
shown immediately when I have taken the wrong turning at unmarked
intersections out in the boonies.  It's saved me long backtrackings in
each instance.
