Subject: Re: [T2] Heater booster idea - $17

From: &quot;Don Tuleja&quot; &lt;durocshark_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; I read online somewhere a bus owner removed the squirrel cage fan from the
booster housing and mounted a bilge fan over the opening. Seemed very happy
with it, though it looked kinda ugly. =)

I've done something like that, but it isn't in the bus yet.

I used the plate that holds the squirrel cage motor to the cage itself to
mount the bilge blower.  I had to cut the mounting bracket out of the center
to open it up for the blower.  Pics here:

It was scary how well it mated together, almost like they planned it that
way.  I have to mount the cage back in the bus, then find the two hoses that
connect it to the heater boxes.  I'm moving to a new home at the moment and
won't be able to get to it for some time.

When it's hooked up I'll post here how well (or how badly) it worked.
