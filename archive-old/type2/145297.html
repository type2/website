Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender - bend the arm

Don says it's the contacts.  I'll check it out when it fails again.  Cheers...KR

the sender arm is bent so that it is not accurately giving the picture in
the tank. That means when mine reads empty it will probably have a lot of
gas left in it. Since mine has already had the cut under the back mat in my
westy, I am going to take the sender out this summer and bend the arm so
that it reads on reserve just as I get a gallon of fuel left.

Regards,
Courtney
