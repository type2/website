&gt; Ok, so I'm trying to figure out what I need to start from a scratch
&gt; longblock and go all new.  Tom Wilson book tells me I need at least two
&gt; washers, so I know that much.  Would this complete my longblock:
&gt; 
&gt;    3 washers (VWB111-105-235A)
&gt;    1 drive pinion (VWB040-105-231.1)
&gt;    1 spring ((VWB040-105-233)
&gt; 
&gt; And that would complete my distributor gear system, ready to drop the
&gt; distributor in?  Or do I need to be ordering any other components?

Stephen:
I think you were right the first time. It's an assembled long block,
right? Then all the crank pieces are already in there- two gears,
spacer, two woodruff keys ( does anyone know: do they call those things
woodruff in der vaterland-auf deutsch?), snapring, oil slinger. So,
unless the beetlemex people expect you to split the case (I'm sure they
don't), you just need your first list.
