&gt; I had a rebuilt engine installed in my Vanagon 1 year ago by an
independent
&gt; mechanic and I brought it to a VW dealer for a tune up and they told me my
&gt; compression was 80,80,30,80
&gt; I brought it back to the mechanic who said it was 105.105.105.105
&gt; Any suggestions how to determine the &quot;real&quot; compression?
