Dave, you might want to just replace the valve cover gaskets first.
Recently, on a 77 engine, had unexplained oil dripping from lots of places.
Imagined a large repair job. Ended up that a very small gasket leak had
sprayed oil into some *unlikely* places. Replaced gasket as a first
step...and the problem disappeared. Good luck. Marv krupp
