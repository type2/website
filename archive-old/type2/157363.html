Subject: Re: [T2] sliding window update

I brazed mine back on about ten years ago or so. I
don't remember if you have to remove the window frame
- if so, that is the worst part. If you can avoid
doing that, the rest is gravy. -BaH

&gt; Well, I tore into my driver's side window that
&gt; wouldn't come back  up.  It appears that the part
&gt; that attaches to the bottom of the  window has
&gt; broken apart from the part that screws it to the 
&gt; slider.  I have another door I've been saving for
&gt; Billy and it has  the same problem.  (Sorry, Billy) 
&gt; I've been unable to get  the part off of the bottom
&gt; of the window.  I don't really want to  break the
&gt; glass.   I guess once I got it off, I could have it 
&gt; welded back onto the part with the screws.  I may
&gt; look and see if  I can find one online.  But I doubt
&gt; it.  Any ideas?   Surely somebody else has had this
&gt; problem.  Too cold now to drive  without it.
