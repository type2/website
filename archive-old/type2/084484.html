Subject: Re: [T2] Rear side taillight for 79 Bus

Sadly, I've got a few, but they're all in my bus in Atlanta! I was hoping 
to share them at Everybus, but didn't quite make it.

West Coast Metric has the lens, but I don't think the holder is made anymore.

I really need to go junkyarding soon.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I am searching for a passenger side, rear SIDE tail
&gt; light (the small red one).  I need to buy the cover,
&gt; as well as the housing.  Does anyone know of an online
&gt; store that sells this?  I have been unable to find it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for the help,
&gt; Nick
