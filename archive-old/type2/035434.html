Subject: Re: Source for 2 liter heads

Just my 2 cents about heads. Over a year ago I had a
set of heads rebuilt my MSHP. These were &quot;virgin&quot;
heads that were from the same engine and never
rebuilt. I checked the cc's before and after the
rebuilding and there was very little (&lt;1 ml)
difference. 

Perhaps I was very lucky, the heads just needed a
rebuild, slight flycutting and no welding was
required. The work MSHP did was fine with me. After
over 15,000 miles I have had no problems with the
heads.

I did set the CR for about 7.1 and have a somewhat
rich (cool) mixture.

I run the engine for daily driving and non-stop trips
between NY and Florida. 20+ hour trips with stops only
for fuel.

Perhaps MSHP's problem is low quality of the core
heads they sometimes have to use?
