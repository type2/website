Subject: '77 Heat?

As the Subject says... Heat?  My '77 does have heat coming from the vents,
however the quantity is pathetic.  The flappers are wired open, and the
blower is operating.  I know that heat is a problem on loafs, but this is a
vehicle designed in Germany, right?  It gets COLD in Germany.  How little
volume do these things actually produce?  At the cuurrent volume, it would
take hours to de-ice the windshield...
