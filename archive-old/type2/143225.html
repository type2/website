Subject: GWB with its top off

Chris and Jim (from Busted Bus) just left after helping get the high top off
the GWB and into my garage. It was a tight squeeze, but we got it in.

However, what we found under the top is depressing:

The pics don't really tell the tale. But the rust around where the top
mounted goes all the way through every piece. It's completely rusted out.

Decision time. What to do?
