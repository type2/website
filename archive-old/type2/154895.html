Subject: RE: [T2] Brazilian VW Bus - racist term??

The term is generally considered racist and using it here opens up a political argument, OBVIOUSLY, because it has, and politics that have nothing to do with busses have nothing to do with this list, as far as I am concerned, just to be safe in this SOCIETY avoid terms that are not acceptable in the non-virtual society and we can all get along without the hateful politics.

Would you use that term at work?

I have done my best to not reveal how I actually feel about this term or politics, we should all do the same, in my opinion, again, of course
