Thom - no offense, but it seems you could prolly afford to put this thing
out yerself! Don't know about conflict of interest rules, but... once the
hard part of assembling the data is done, replication should be easy enough
- - hell, if the neanderthals who swipe porn offa the Net and compile it
into CDROMs can do it (uhhhh.... so I've heerd tell!), so can you. Believe
me, if you can get the info down, you've got the thing paid for. You know
you have ~100 folks here who have cdrom drives (even tho I don't (yet),I'll
even mail in $100 deposit as soon as you are ready to go to press - so long
as its for a MAC!) who are a potential customer base for starters. You
could get together with the NEATO folks and add Mcodes, threads on starter
fixes, yadayada. If your company is too STUPID to recognize a market when
it runs over their foot, then perhaps some insightful entrepeneur will show
them the error of their ways, hinthint?
