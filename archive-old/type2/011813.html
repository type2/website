Subject: tightening oil filler
Date: Wed, 04 Oct 2000 15:04:53 -0700
From: &quot;Thomas J. Tarka&quot; &lt;tommy_at_slackers_dot_net&gt;


On my first long trip with my '71 Bus, I popped the
hatch to check my oil when I had stopped for gas, and
noticed that the oil filler had come almost
completely loose from the filler neck.  

Since then, I've made it a point to hand tighten it
every morning  -- it's been vibrating itself loose, little
by little -- but my parts shipment just came in, 
including the oil-filler-neck-nut tool, so I can actually
tighten it for real.  

My question: is there a torque spec. for how tight this
should be, or should i just tighten it good and tight?

(I'm only really asking because of the torque spec for 
the oil drain plug which I wouldn't have otherwise
given a second thought to tightening &quot;good and tight&quot;)
