&gt; Might be a good way the weather the sudden increases in fuel prices too. I 
&gt; know we filled up our CR-V and Cabrio minutes before the first Katrina price 
&gt; spike. I think we figured at $2.45 versus the $2.89 just down the street 
&gt; (they were changing the prices as we pumped) we saved about $9...
&gt; 
&gt; $9 gets my attention but maybe that's just me... &lt;griN!&gt;

   You could pull a John Denver who, during the 1979 gas &quot;crisis&quot;, tried to
fill his 2000 gallon underground tank with black market gas so he could 
keep driving his Jeep around the green, green hills... ;-(
