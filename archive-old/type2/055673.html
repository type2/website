&gt; That is what made it burn like that.  Oh, yeah, and it was filled with
&gt; hydrogen.

Actually, the Hindenburg was covered with cotton fabric covered with a
dope made of cellulose butylrate acetate, iron oxide, and aluminum
powder.  No paraffin or kerosene.  The purpose of the dope was to make
the surface rigid, not something you would want in a Westy tent!

I think that the silicone-based waterproofing compounds will provide a
satisfactory and water-tight solution to leaky tents without undue
danger.
