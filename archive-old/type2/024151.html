Hi Jamie,

The only way a brake drum would work is if it were itself perfectly balanced - including the nuts which of course you would then only be able to use on the studs for which they were balanced.
So although you could in theory in practice it would (in my opinion) be more trouble than it was worth; especially as a good tyre shop should be able to do it properly.

Good luck

&gt; &gt; Adjustable adaptor? Find a place that does medium size truck work.
&gt; &gt; Diesel shop maybe. They should have fixed adaptor to wide five rims.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering why a front brake drum installed on the wheel wouldn't work as
&gt; an adapter to be able to spin the tire on the balancing machine??
&gt; 
&gt; Or can it?
