Subject: Re: [T2] Camping &amp; Propane Heaters

I guess I was not clear.  The catalytic heaters in both my pick up bed camper
and trailer were surface mount.  The rear of the heater case was solid and it
had a solid cover that clipped over the front.  There was no venting. In the
trailer, it was mounted on an interior partition.  We did always leave a window
cracked open a little.

&gt; Normally, these units are vented to the outside for both intake and exhaust.
&gt; The ~4' diameter outlet on the outside of the camper/RV handles both
&gt; functions.
