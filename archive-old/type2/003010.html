&gt; I recently acquired a 71 bus - advwag - with no engine.
&gt; Is the engine case a '1-year only' for the 71 because of the bosses for
the
&gt; mustache bar?

In the USA, 68 to 71 all used an upright 1600 with the rear hanger bar.
68-70 were single port. 71 was one-year-only because it was dual port with a
doghouse cooler.
