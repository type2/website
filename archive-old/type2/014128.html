Subject: Re: [T2] part# identification help



&gt; just about to cruise out on a dogwalk this evening and found a broken black
&gt; plastic pile of part shards under the streetlight out front. the pieces
&gt; were real small. i couldn't make heads or tails of it them, except i found
&gt; the tiny vw insignia, and gathered three pieces with a nine digit part
&gt; number: 211.415.671 black, plastic 1-2&quot;, round. hopefully it'll be cheap
&gt; and replaceable :)       if it was mine, which i suspect it'd be off the 68
&gt; DC     - steve

Well, I brought up Google, keyed in the part number and &quot;vw&quot; and got the following reference:

http://w1.316.telia_dot_com/~u31614134/lager%20FB%20200101%20ut.pdf

Which lists the part number you specify as &quot;211 415 671 signalknapp, helsvart&quot;

Being an American, my knowledge of languages is shamefully inadequate, particularly when scandinavian languages is concerned.  I 
think this is in Swedish.

More poking about on Google for &quot;signalknapp&quot; yields:

http://user.tninet.se/~mje633s/ignition.html

Which shows a picture of a &quot;signalknapp&quot; which is apparently a momentary push button switch, perhaps a horn button.  Since your piece 
of plastic is about 2&quot; in diameter, this might be it.

I pulled the horn button off of my '71, and inside is inscribed &quot;211 415 671&quot;

Case closed!  :)
