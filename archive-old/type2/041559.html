Subject: Tow Bar Question

I am thinking of making a tow-bar for a bus that will easily connect up
without having to disturb the brake booster as some tow bars do.
Thinking of making it so I can just remove the front bumper and bolt
the tow-bar on at the two center front bumper connection points.  That
would space the tow bar arms about 21 inches apart, and would have 
the 4 front bumper bolts holding in in place.  Does anyone see a 
problem with doing it this way??  Ideas and/or opinions are welcomed.
