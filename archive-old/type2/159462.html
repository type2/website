Subject: Re: [T2] Whistling Bus - The new guy finally fixed his own bus

I like whistler.  It's a simple name and it has a fun history to it ;)

Mine is called Superbus..  and I didn't even name it, my friend called
it that and it stuck.  I guess he was surprised it would go 70 when he
was driving on part of the trip from WA to CA and yelled out &quot;suuuuuuper
buuuuus!&quot; ;)
