&gt;i am in agreement on the ignition system being the culprit......beside
&gt;you can give it a complete tune up in the process b 4 going about tearing
&gt;out the carbs.............(remember bosch plugs are the best for your
&gt;bus)

 I agree with this but i site an odd example that might be your culprit.
on my 71 Honda CB500 motorcycle (i know bear with me) i started to
experience the same symptoms you described. it happened almost overnight
but the symptoms started while i was riding in the rain...which tends to
wreak havoc on my exposed plugs and such...so i thought...it's just the
rain n. but the rain stopped and the symptoms didn't so. i had a new
breaker plate (points and such) so i thought well i better pop this in and
set my timing. so i did. but it didn't help. so to make a long story short
it was my first cylinder (1 out of 4) that had a bad sparkplug gap. i have
no idea how it got that way, but that's what it was.

so check your plugs first..you never know  when the plug gremlins have
changed your spark plug gap.

later

ps if anyboady has a 71 westy  for sale in the bay area, drop me a pmail.
