Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect  /RANT/

&gt; Wow, how often do you collide?  I haven't established a &quot;usual&quot;
&gt; method of dealing with accidents as I've managed to avoid other vehicles for
&gt; a number of years.

Personally, I've never had an accident where I was at fault. But I've been hit
three times and my ex-wife about double that. Tennessee drivers aren't the
best.

Ironically, I've never been hit in a small car - always big cars like buses
and pickups.

-Eric
