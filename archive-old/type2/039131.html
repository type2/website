Subject: Aftermarket CV joints

I have found some minimal pitting in my CV joints upon an inspection  to
clean and repack. After checking prices and supply I chose to go with a
reputable FLAPS. Jerry provided me complete axle with both CV joints,
boots and grease for $63.00 per side. They have a lifetime warranty and
I have done business with him for many years. My question to the group
is comparable quality of OEM parts vs after market. These appear to be
Ford CV joints as they have their logo on them. The fit is good and
dimensions the same as the originals I took off. They have a different
cover plate so I will not be able to use the small backing plates under
the bolts. In doing a fair amount of work to this 1968 Type II and being
new to Vows I'm weighing the parts and price issues as I go along OEM vs
after market.

Thanks,
Steve
