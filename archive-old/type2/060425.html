Hallo.

I'm helping a friend put her '78 Westy back together and i've got a few questions.
1.  her original f.i. engine blew out and they replaced it with an 1800 (I think), though she was told it was a carbureted '77 2000cc engine.  Is this at all possible??  The numbers on the block are GE blah blah, indicating that piece is from the original '78, though it has no lifters and of course the carburetor.  With this information, 2.  What can I look for to specifically identify the  engine so I can time it correctly?
I timed it to 7.5 btdc because that made it sound the best (10 atdc killed it).
3.  Since it is a Weber carb and all the Bentley/Muir tuning instructions are for Solex, how do I idle/balance it?  Are the tuning screws obvious and relative to the Solex ones?
and finally
4.  I'm really carbureter dumb, is this a dual carb?  The only numbers I can find on the thing are a 1 on the front and a 26 and a 27 on the right side.  Everything seems to be done twice on the thing, but it is all one piece unlike the descriptions of the Solex for an 1800.
Thanks for plowing through this, any help is incredibly appreciated.
