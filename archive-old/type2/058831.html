 I'm going to get a new longblock, and I have in my
 possession an alternator from a '74 Beetle as well as
 the resquisite wiring (regulator, etc.) to make that
 work.  Can I use the mechanical fuel pump from my '71
 engine?  Are there any other modifications which need
 to be made?  I have the fan housing and the correct
 plate, etc.
 
 TIA,

Your gonna need an alternator stand and an alternator fuel pump, these have an
angled top to clear the alternator stand, their is also me thinks a difference
between the alternator strap verses the generator strap.  Something you may
give a thought to, this would be an excellent time to change over to an
electric fuel pump.  The stock location of the mechanical fuel pump has always
been sorta of questioned. ie. fuel pump leaks, flows on to crank pulley, gets
slung around the engine compartment, Boom!!!  Got any marshmallows?
  
 Peace, Love, and my english teacher is spinning in her grave, but I got to
use alternator 4                         
             times in one sentence, cool!!!
