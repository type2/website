Subject: Re: head bolts

Admittedly I jumped the gun, assuming that &quot;68 Kombi&quot; at the opening of his
message meant that he was referring to a 68 Kombi which, to my knowledge,
had an upright engine and hence no head gaskets :)

&gt;well, sorta. my 79 2 liter has a metal gasket in between the cyls &amp; the
&gt;head. When i pulled it off for a problem valve i noticed &amp; replaced
&gt;these parts. pulling it off would influence the Compression &amp; i didn't
&gt;want to do that.
