&gt; Fellow Listees,

&gt; While checking my &quot;new&quot; '68 bus, I noticed that the bolts (?) going
through
&gt; the engine bearer into the engine itself were missing.  Upon closer
&gt; inspection, they have broken off in the engine case.  On top of
this, the left
&gt; one was put in using helicoil threads.  While researching this in the
&gt; archives, I came across something called a &quot;Busmount Engine Adaptor&quot;
- Bugpack
&gt; part # 4538.  Is this something to convert other engines to a bus? 
Can I use
&gt; this to somehow attach the engine to the bearer?  Also, does anybody
know what
&gt; size the missing/broken bolts are?  Finally, what are my chances
trying to
&gt; remove the bolt broken off with the helocoil threads?

The adapter won't work, as it occupies the same space as the existing
bosses.

Best bet is to try and remove the studs.  If conventional weapons
don't work, find a shop that does EDM.  (look in yellow pages under
&quot;Electrical Discharge Machining&quot;)  A good EDM man can remove the
broken studs and leave the threads unscathed.  The machinist can best
advise you about the helicoil.
