I had some work done recently on the 81 camper and while in the shop had the
CO mixture set to spec. A couple of things happened as a result. One was that
I found a top speed approaching 80 when previously I had never topped 74 even
down hill. Another was that on the Atlanta to Birmingham roundtrip this
weekend I got better than 17mpg when previously 16 was the high tide and 15
mote typical. Finally I had the one result that I had been warned about: heat!

In low 70's weather I found myself limited to about 55mph If I wanted to keep
the temps under 235* when previously I could manage 60 to 65mph without much
difficulty. Is there a solution to this? Would it help at all to back off the
timing from 7.5 btdc to perhaps 5 btdc? Any ideas?

Thanks,

Weston
