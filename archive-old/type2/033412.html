Zikes Mark, and I thought I was bad.  Have you considered professional help?
There can be only one explanation for this behaviour.  We have been taken
over by VW collecting aliens intent on world domination.  :-D

&gt; But worst of all, I discovered every 
&gt; bus within a 
&gt; five-mile radius of my apartment and then had to visit each 
&gt; one of them 
&gt; once a day. I altered my running route to take in about half 
&gt; of them, and 
&gt; the other half altered my driving route to work and back.
