Subject: Re: [T2] floor pan replacement and part question

Jen,

The &quot;Belly Pan&quot; is not what you are looking for.  That goes underneath
the front of the bus below the frame members and covers where the gas
pedal and parking brake are.

I can't help you much on the floor pan.  I have a '73 that I replaced
the floor beneath the drivers side after sticking a boot heal through
it.  I cut out the rusted area and welded in sheet metal (cut from our
old washing machine lid).  I haven't seen underneath a 72 so I can't
compare for you.  Anyone else?

&gt; replaced.  I do not want to go the fiberglass route, and would rather cut out
&gt; and weld in a replacement.  My bus is a 1972.  Wolfsburg West has a 1973-1979
&gt; floor plate for $125, but none for my year.  The Bus Depot has what they
&gt; call &quot;Belly Pan, Under Front Cab Area, 68-79 Bus&quot; for $34.95, but there is
&gt; not a picture.  Is this what I need?  Why is there an overlap of years
