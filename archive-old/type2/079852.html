Subject: Can't figure it out!!!

Hey everybody! 
This is my first post and in desperation it is! I have a 76 bus w/ 79 motor (code GE). FI of course, but have had a strange occurence plagueing me for quite sometime. Here is the symptoms...
Bus acts fine like nothing is wrong...
Starts idles everthing is great, then...
Driving at cruising speeds engine not hot normal temps(its about 30 degrees outside), just heading home from church. Been driving at speed (65mph or so) for about 10-12 mins, and bus starts to cut out and back in, then out but still running kind of, no power, and lots of backfiring. Then pull over and bus dies. Wait 2-3 mins and bus starts great and runs fine!
I am at a loss. This started sometime ago, probably 2-3 months or more.  So my first step was to give a tune up because it needed it anyway. I replaced cap, rotor, coil, plugs, wires, fuel filter and so on. This seems to fix problem &quot;sometime ago&quot;, then I had a vacuum leak so fixed that and everything has been fine.  The only thing that I can think of that I have done differently was last night I installed my new set of H4 headlights. I don't think these two things would be related but anything is possible...? If anyone has any ideas they would be appreciated!  Thanks a bunch in advance.
Its just weird cause it only does it at speed sometimes and then if I kill it wait a min or two everthing seems fine? Who knows?

Thanks, 
Casey
