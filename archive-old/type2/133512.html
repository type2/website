&gt; &gt; Maybe it's just me, but I get sorta sick of ACVW drivers complaining that
&gt; &gt; VWof A doesn't market to us. Hello!! We're the cheapest bastards I know of
&gt; &gt; (Not that there's anything wrong with that).  ;)
&gt;
&gt; Why? I know of several old beetle owners that bought new beetles. And
&gt; it's not just us ACVW owners that would buy into it. Many of the
&gt; people that get excited when they see us in our old busses would buy a
&gt; modern version.

I would love to have a new mid sized van that is basically stripped with
only maybe A/C and auto tranny.
