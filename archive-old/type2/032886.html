Subject: AC Compressor-Continued, Tin needed

Volks,

OK, so here is where I am with the AC compressor.  I think with just a
little rigging the Sanden compressor will fit.  But right now I just dont't
have the time.  I'm going to put the motor in with no AC.  After all it is
winter time and I don't need to be cool right now.......what I need is to
drive my bus, now that would be really cool.

The piece of tin that fits on the back drivers side corner of the engine is
cut to go around the compressor and with no compressor there is a big hole
and you know the rest of the story.

Here are my two questions:

1. Does anyone know of a source either new or used for this piece of tin.
2. Can I put this piece of tin on after I get the engine installed .

Thanks to all those who responded, the help is really appreciated.  All the
repair manuals are nice but you people are the greatest.

PS: If I keep working on this thing maybe one day I'll be able to answer
some of the list questions.  Now thats a scary thought.
