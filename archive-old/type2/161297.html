Hi Mark,

Thanks for the warning about the H code cases. I'm planning to get a
new aluminum case, so it won't matter so much. Also, new heads
(probably) and new pistons and cylinders (almost certainly). Full flow
oil filter. If I stay with carburation for a while, I'll stick with the
single carburetor. Everything will be measured, ground or rebuilt if
needed, replaced as necessary.

Mark

&gt;&gt; The engine code leads me to

&gt; hello mark  These weren't the best motors. H number on case with 8mm
&gt; oil pump studs.  had major problems cracking cases and head studs
&gt; pulling. I think the alloy mix was weaker on these and B cases. You
&gt; can linebore them and install case savers and get some use out of
&gt; them. You would be better off using a 73 and up case as they came with
&gt; the factory installed case savers and were stronger cases. The best
&gt; ones are out of the FI bugs but they don't have the holes for mounting
&gt; the mech. fuel pump. Bob(Boston engines) donald preferrs these for
&gt; building Zambonia motors. later  mark dearing
