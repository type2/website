&lt;&lt; Tony, do you know of a company that does stainless exhaust for upright

engines?  Were the cracks you referred to on VW systems?

Steve-
          Uninformed as to uprights, try some of the vendors. Someone should
reply to the list...
          The coated manifolds I refered to were on some Morgans/Triumphs/
and MG's. A few owners reported failures after one race and others after
one year of street driving. Might be a combination of older castings and
newer technologies...Under hood/bonnet temps went down considerably with
the coatings, though. Expensive trade-off. The guys running tubular headers
didn't seem to have the problems...YMMV, etc.
