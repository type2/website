Subject: Failed rocker arm stud

-It's been a while but I think i remember the stud
pulled right out of the head.  Metal fatigue from to
much heat from an engine that had to high of a CR.

I have since CR'd all my engines to 7.5 or under.

&gt; &gt;  I rebuilt this engine for

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I had 2 of these broken studs when my bus was being
&gt; revived reviewed
&gt; for worthiness. Now fixed and engine blessed.
&gt; 
&gt; None of us had any idea what caused it, other than
&gt; initially over torqued.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I ask what you thought might have caused yours
&gt; to break?
