Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

I'm with you Mike, I never pushed any of my Westies past 70 mainly because
the side winds on the freeways are just TOO unpredictable, and I don't care
what anybody says, NO Westy had good steering in side winds at 70, because I
tried everything to stop the wandering, including superstiff tires, and new
steering box, etc etc. The darn boxes just aren't aerodynamic. :-) Anybody
who drives them at 85 must be retired F-18 pilots who need their adrenalin
buzz for the day!!

Regards,

Courtney

I guess that I'd an odd out here. I drive the speed limit because of my

faith. Granted, I'm not a saint, but I try.

 

In the Bible (oh-oh, the &quot;B&quot; word!) Christians are exhorted to obey their

government unless the government insists that you do something that clearly

goes against the Scriptures. The speed limit falls into the &quot;obey&quot;

catagory. So I drive the speed limit.

 

But my question for those who fly the swift wind of speed is this...

 

What do you do when you have to make an emergency manuvuer at 85+?! A

flying bread box is still a flying bread box! I'd be terrified to think of

making a violent manuvuer at over 70 mph, let alone anything higher.

 

My family is more important to me than getting &quot;there&quot; a few minutes

earlier. At 60 mph, with no stops, you get 60 miles in, well, an hour

(duh). At 85 miles per hour, you get there in 42 minutes, a savings of 18

minutes. Theorhetically, on a trip of 1000 miles (at 60 mph) you'd get

there in 16.5 hours. At 85 you'd get there in 11.7 hours.

 

You've saved roughly 5 hours travel time, but why do we drive buses in the

first place? To get there, or to get there without blurring the scenery as

we drive by it? And while at any speed over 35 mph, you stand a good chance

of severe bus damage and injury in an accident, at 85 mph you're almost

guarentted a totalled bus and death. Hmm... has anyone survived an accident

at 70 mph+?

 

I'm not critizing those who choose to push their buses to the limits (and

sometimes beyond). I'm just concerned about my own and my family's safety.
