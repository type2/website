After studying the pages in Bentley (5-12 and 5-13) on late bay exhaust 
permutations, I have some questions.

First, according to Bentley, the 75-78 style exhaust was intended to 
improve &quot;ease of installation and removal&quot; and improve &quot;heat output for 
the passenger compartment.&quot; Were they kidding? I cannot figure out why 
the 75-78 systems could be considered an improvement over the 72-74 on 
either of these counts.

Second, it looks like the top schematic of the &quot;49 states&quot; 1979 exhaust 
could be adapted to 75-78 vehicles, using 72-74 heat exchangers -- either 
straight, or with a modification in the crossover tube. But I have never 
seen one of these. Are they, uhm, less than abundant?
