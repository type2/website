Subject: unhappy rear end

--=====================_1796082==_.ALT

I just got my 74 single cab out of the shop and the front end is very tight 
and happy...however, since the front end is no longer loose, the loose back 
end rears its ugly head!  It seems that the mechanic has discovered that 
the left rear torsion bar bushings are worn slap out!  I've verified this 
because you can move the entire spring plate front to back (fif) about an 
inch.  Would this looseness cause the rear end to take on a mind of its own 
and cause the back end to sway?  it seems that when driving, the truck 
seems to be steering itself from the rear sometimes (which is 
scary).  Geometry tells me that the effect would be negligible, but it's 
really scary to drive this thing with the rear end wanting to go in all 
directions!  Is this swaying possibly due to the worn out torsion bar 
bushings?  TIA, Greg
