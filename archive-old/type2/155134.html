Subject: Baltimore beltway 4/27

Last evening, we saw a couple of emergency vehicles assisting what appeared to 
be a disabled VW Type 2... this was on I695, the Baltimore beltway, in the 
general area of Catonsville.  We were not able to stop (due to the traffic 
conditions at that moment, and also because we needed to arrive at our 
destination in a short time).

Was this anyone on the Type 2 List...??
