Hi all,
     Blowing through the high desert today. Never made it out of 
Victorville on Sunday. Too many toys.  ;-)

     Actually, come 11:30 on Sunday morning we weren't even close to 
leaving. Considering we needed to go easy on the bus for the next 150 or 
so miles to finish the wear-in period on the rebuild, it didn't make much 
sense to leave. So, we spent most of the day dorking about Victorville 
with Darryl. Had quite the blast. Readjusted the timing and dwell on the 
bus, it was substantially off, and while we were at the shop Darryl gave 
Craig some lessons on the Volkswagen internal combustion engine. Helps 
when you've got a shop full of engines in various states of repair, much 
easier to comprehend than the lousy illustrations in shop manuals. Later 
on that evening we took out Darryl's dirt bike and did some off road 
riding, quite fun but very different from my old street bike. Much less 
stable... ;-)

     So, this morning we made it out fairly early, gave the bus one last 
check at the shop, and hit the road. 'Course, since we're going easy on 
the engine we actually boogied on out of Victorville to Lucerne Valley, 
then cut back over to Barstow, pretty much the long way around. Stopped 
off at Newberry Springs for some lunch (Taco Bell Express!! Yippie!), and 
we're just rollin' along. We're on part of what was Route 66, but frankly 
it's mostly just an Interstate highway with souvenier stands nowadays. 
Things should get a lot more interesting when we hit Arizona. We'll be 
camping at one of the National Forest campgrounds this evening, which 
should be an enjoyable change of pace. Then it's on to Roswell...  ;-)


Peace,
