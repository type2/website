Subject: Re: [T2] trading time?

&gt; I have a z-bed (plaid cloth, in great condition: 1 small hole, slight fading 
&gt; on fabric); the cabinet beneath the z-bed - clean, needs re-gluing at one or 
&gt; two tongue/groove connections; a panel for what looks like it goes over 
&gt; where the stove and table go, AND the overhead and side closet compartments 
What state and city are these parts located in?
