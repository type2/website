This reminds me of a couple years ago....being in drivers ed  (been a while
for most of you huh?)  when we drive that drivers ed car around...plastered
with DRIVERS EDUCATION stickers...you really stick out...even more than being
in a bus.  People poke fun at you while riding along side you on the
highway... and can really be a$$hole drivers just because you're in drivers
ed.  I didn't have to deal with that for long...so i just blew it off.

When people do this to me while I'm in my bus ... I just ignore them...  That
is one of the most childish things you can do.  and coming from my 17 year
old mouth...thats pretty derned childish.  I know who/what I am, and am
comfortable with that.  A good friend of mine (who also happens to drive a
bus) calls me the &quot;closet hippie&quot; because I have short hair...yet drive a
bus...like the music...etc etc...as a joke..and I laugh...because its
funny....and because I know who it came from... and who I am.
I realize that the vehicle I drive attracts a LOT of attention...especially
up here in WI.  Most of the time I enjoy it...but sometimes it does get
annoying...so i can understand where you're coming from..  A bus has a lot of
stereotypes...but one major one.  &quot;hippie&quot;  I like my bus...its simple, fun,
attracts fun and interesting people, and takes me to places of the world I
would never dream of going to if I owned say...a Ford.  Its a symbol of
freedom.  (some people like to refer to me as unemployed)  but...dammit...I'm
free...  for another year anyways... ;-)  My work right now is other
volkswagens... Thats my job...it may not be steady...but its a job none the
less.
Be proud of the vehicle you drive...blow off these people who poke fun at
you.... I used to get it a LOT from the people I went to school with after I
first got my bus...but now all the big truck &quot;hick&quot; boys get a kick out of
it....and I don't have problems with them anymore.  People respect what I
like...because they know that I'm really into it.  When I was looking at my
first bus (stella) I brought my mom over to see her before I bought her.  I
never heard my mother laugh so loud.  Now, she wonders what I'm doing with
them...and how the buses are doing... and even goes for the occasional ride.
People are sheep...in a sense.  They like to follow the herd and blend in....
no problems then...right?  wrong!  Stick out....be different.  Its fun.
Visit your local coffee shop (just got back from there...met a WONDERFUL
musician from Buffalo New York travelling the country playing solo), write
poetry, go shopping in your pajamas, take your kids to the park, go to a
volkswagen event, make a pot of steamin hot and spicy chili....do what you
like.... be proud of it.  I'm proud of what I do...and I think it shows.
Some call me obsessed (read ex-girlfriend) but I think I'm immersed in one of
the many different flavors of the world.d

If you drive a VW...you never have a reason to be bored....i bet I could find
10 things on YOUR bus that could use attention....i could find at least that
many on my bus I'm sure...

this wasn't meant to be an inspirational preaching....but if it came out that
way...so be it

Tomorrow is a different day....do something different....wear your shoes as
little as possible.

Good day everyone,
Isaiah


&gt; but after a guy in El Paso gave us a peace
&gt; sign on the highway while pretending to toke something laughing
&gt; with his head up and down I got to feeling like a clown.  This may
&gt; be because I'm only a few years older than my bus, but I felt
&gt; gawked at..  It was then that I started really missing being
&gt; inconspicuous.
