Subject: Re: [T2] cross drilled drums

Normal bus highway speeds combined with our inherently high drag have never
caused me any brake heating or fade problems even on some of the longest,
steepest grades in the US (assuming you're not running your bus in a grand
prix). My experience with bus rear brakes is that they have more than enough
capacity to lock the rear wheels, after which their performance is
irrelevant.  Remember, a large percentage of the bus's weight gets shifted
to the front wheels, so the front disks really have to do most of the work
since that's where the traction is.

The one time my front brakes didn't work, it was really nice that the rear
ones did, though they didn't do much before locking up.

I'd agree with the other posters that cutting/drilling/welding brake
structural components would be a bad, bad idea.

Hey guys, many of the hot rod guys here at work who can't find or afford to
put disks on their rods have the same basic brake problems as we do and
what they are doing is having holes drilled in the drums kinda like cross
drilled disks, you get the idea i think.  anyway, they are reporting much
