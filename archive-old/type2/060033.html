      There's no doubt it can do that, I've had batteries like that. In fact I went one whole
northern MN winter with a battery much like that. It was a brand new battery, only about a
month old, when somebody slammed the car slightly when it was parked, no visible damage
except some paint gone on the bumper, but the battery, which wasn't held down, slid forward
hard enough to put a small hole in one corner. Couldn't find anyway to patch it, and didn't
have much money, so I essentially had a 10 volt battery for quite awhile. If it wasn't too
cold, and you could get it to catch the first try, you were okay. No second chances tho. And
I've had other batteries that got bounced enough to break a plate off in a cell, shorting out
that cell.
