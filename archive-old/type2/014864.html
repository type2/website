Subject: Newly installed engine problems
Message-ID: &lt;2d9dff54.249d9c9a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello list members. I have been reading for a few months and now need to 
present a couple technical questions.  The vehicle is a 1970 bus that I have 
been resurrecting. PO had driven until it quit running and parked it for a 
year.  I bought a &quot;SIR&quot; long block from Kragen and installed it with new 
clutch parts, cable.  The engine runs well so far(about 2 hours running so 
far). My problem is when I start it in gear with clutch depressed, it tries 
to move! I start it in neutral and try and move, it is hard to get in gear.  
I put it on the rack and started it in neutral-the rear wheels 
moved(forward).  I have pulled the engine once already and measured clutch 
relationships-all seemed OK, matched old parts.  I have adjusted clutch cable 
all ways. NO change.  TIA for help.  I will get home Monday to check the 
posts on the list.  I also have a small problem with no turn signals, 
everything else works. I'm still researching that. I have Bentley, Haynes &amp; 
Muir.
