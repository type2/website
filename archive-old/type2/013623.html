Mike,
  I've got a '78 Westy with a Yakima rack mounted on
the fiberglass top.  FWIW, I haven't had any problems
with my setup and I'm perfectly happy with it. 
Although you can't open it with a load up top (the
brackets can't handle any significant weight), it sure
beats having to take the rack off (as you would have
to with the rain gutter mounts) to pop the top.  If
you want more specifics on the setup or a picture,
send me an email.

Alabama Pete in Colorado...

&gt; towers w/ the HiRise 
&gt; extension will fit over the fiberglass top when
&gt; mounting the feet to the 
&gt; raingutter and not the pop-top?  I do not want to
&gt; mount them on the pop-top. 
&gt;   I know that Thule has a system that will work like
&gt; this, but would really 
&gt; prefer Yakima as I've owned Thule's before and did
&gt; not care for the crossbar 
&gt; strength.  Thank you for any help.
