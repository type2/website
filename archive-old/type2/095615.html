Subject: RE: [T2] pop-up tent replacement

&gt; Accepting the fact that there was probably just a single supplier, or, at
&gt; best, all suppliers using similar materials and techniques ...........
&gt; I replaced Casper's original tent with a cotton one purchased from JC
&gt; Whitney on a special sale plus discount about three years ago.
&gt;
&gt; The tent was used that same year for a 2 month trip.
&gt; The next year, it was used for another 2 month trip.
&gt; Last year, it was used for a 7 month trip.
&gt;
&gt; After just the first year's use on the 2 month trip and the subsequent
&gt; campings, I began to notice the cotton tent starting to show substantial
&gt; fading of color.


I couldn't say definitively whether Whitney shipped the same product then as
they do now.  At one time there were a couple of small pop top canvas
manufacturers who have since folded (no pun intended :-).  So Whitney's
supplier may or may not have been one of them (although even then, the
present manufacturer was by far the leading supplier of this product).
Today the one supplier is pretty much all there is (save any very small
upholstery shops, individuals, etc. who may sell them individually but not
through retailers).   My experience with fading has not been bad at all with
the cotton canvas (at least from this manufacturer). My friend put one on
his Westy about 4 years ago, for example, and it looks the same today as
then. (If it has faded, it's faded so evenly that no difference is
noticable.)  But since there are many of them on listmember busses, perhaps
others could say if their experience has been different.
