Subject: Fixing a busted nose
Message-ID: &lt;6DE1D809032CD111B29C002035E72D480130D697_at_MPNTSYDNEY05&gt;

DOH!!!  Last night it was pouring with rain and the unthinkable happened...
I ran up the back of a car in the Kombi :(  Anyway.. the bullbar on the
front saved it from a lot of damage so the floor and interior parts are
totally undamaged.  The nose skin is another thing though.. The bullbar
didn't move but the radiator mounted to it pushed back and into the nose
(Its a V8 powered 75 model).. Anyway to cut a long story short is it
possible to pull the interior out... dash etc and push the nose out from the
inside of the Bus or is it better to just go to a panel beater and get them
to pull the nose back out from the outside..

I prefer the idea of pushing the nose out as it means I can get rid of the
major dents myself and then possibly take it to a panel shop for the final
touches before I do a full respray (I've been planning on it for a while but
now it's a necessity)

Cheers
Steve

P.S The back of the other car was a mess and I'm very happy I had that bull
bar.
