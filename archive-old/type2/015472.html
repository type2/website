&gt;If you look at the evidence of what's going on, there is more on one end of
&gt;the scale than the other.

To this point in time the evidence has yet to be presented in whole to a
competant judge. Grasping at assumptions before the facts are presented
cannot be wholly representative of truth based upon proof. 

What do you think would happen if I started producing gym shoes with the
Nike swatch on them?? That's Nike's logo. The V and W in the circle is
exactly the same to VW. If they don't defend their rights to use it, they
will surely loose control of their image. All the original report said was
they were looking into it, and cooperating very nicely with all involved.
They simply are not a villian in my mind at this point for determining to
what extent their rights have been violated.
