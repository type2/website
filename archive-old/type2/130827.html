Subject: Fuel Injector

I'll try this again, as last time I was trumped by Don's Hi-Top woes... 
(and I just know there are a few &quot;no-carb&quot; FI wizards on the list)


I recently acquired via auction a box of parts that included 4 
injectors.  The seller didn't indicate what year bus the parts were 
from.  The part numbers on all 4 are VW 022 906 031B / Bosch 0 280 150 
100.

 From what little info I've been able to find in my Googling, they 
appear to have the same flow rate as the VW 022 906 031D / Bosch 0 280 
150 114's that were on my bus (and which appear to be the proper part)

Are these a direct interchange part?  What's the difference (aside from 
color of plastic and a slightly different hose barb)?  What was the 
original application?

Thanks
