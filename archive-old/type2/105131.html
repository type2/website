Subject: Re: failure notice

 &gt; The newer and better way is with a UV barrier silicone formula like Armor
 &gt; all. I think that these also have polymers in them. It won't hurt
anything
 &gt; that I know of and can be sprayed on and wiped off and lasts a long time.

 Now I have heard that Armor All is actually harmful to rubber and seals,
and
 shortens their life in the long run, contrary to popular belief.
 The Porsche folks seem to like Zymol, which is pricey, but apparently
 protects/restores seals pretty effectively.
 YMMV.

 &gt; Also I would highly recommend a product in a yellow bottle called
&quot;Rain-X&quot;
&gt; for treating your windows before the rainy season begins. Once tried,
&gt; always
&gt; preferred.

 I can agree with this one from personal experience, for sure.  Rain just
 beads up and goes away, no wipers needed!  And the faster you go, the
better
 it works.
