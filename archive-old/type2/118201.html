Subject: Factory High Top

Hi,

I would like to invite all you high-top bus freaks, and I know you 
are out there, to visit the samba and have a look at this VW factory 
high-top bus. The bus also has the high door option and still sports 
the KPH speedo and a 1600. The pics do not show the tin but the ad 
indicates the bus was brought from Europe (this model was not sold in 
the US but I do not know about Canada) so it should have factory late 
model bus upright tin and hanger bar.  Pretty cool bus!

I am not the seller nor do I know him - just wanted to point out an 
unusual bus for sale.
