Subject: upright generator question

i cc'ed this to both lists as it applies to 67 and earlier and 68-71 US
t2's...

On my 61, yesterday the generator light started acting up... its wierd.

At low RPM's the light is off.  As soon as i get to highway spped its
glowing softly.  As soon as the rpms drop, it goes off again.  the bus
appears to be charging just fine, its wierd for sure.

My only 2 guesses are the brushes in the gen itself are going bad, but
that wouldnt explain why it still charges... My other guess is that there
is a short in the indicator circuit of the regulator but not the charging
circuit...

anyone else have any ideas? is this a classic symptom of ____?

thanks,

Steve
