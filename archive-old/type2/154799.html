Subject: RE: [VB] Hubcap Idea

&gt; I posted this in a reply to another thread, but wanted to run 
&gt; it by the list.
&gt; 
&gt; What if we start a second hubcap around the country this 
&gt; year.  I'd love to be involved in it, since this is the first 
&gt; year I'll have my Bus out.  I'd start it off and either paint 
&gt; one, start a stock one (think my chrome ones are
&gt; aftermarket) or what ever,
&gt; 
&gt; What's everyone think?



If the decision is made to do this, I'd be happy to donate another one to
the cause (I donated the original one). It would be an aftermarket one,
although as I recall so is the existing one. I don't remember if the
existing one is the pre-1971 domed version or the post-1971 flat version,
but whichever it is, I'd suggest using the other version for the second one,
to easily distinguish them, and so that we cover all years.
