Are there any bus experts out there in Colorado Springs that might be able to 
give me a hand on saturday afternoon doing some diagnostics on my bus.  I 
can't figure out what's making me stall so consistantly, but I'm assuming 
it's a pretty simple problem that can be fixed with a little help.
please email me.
thanx
