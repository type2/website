Subject: [T2] 78-79 Air Flow sensor for sale and side markers

Hello everyone If anyone is looking for a 78-79 airflow sensor please let me 
know. I have one for sale at a good price. I also have front reflectors and 
back side lights also for sale. They have the silver or chrome trimming on 
the outside not the black. So if you are interested in any of the parts let 
me know. Thanks
