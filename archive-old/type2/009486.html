&gt; 
&gt; My favorite place in the world. It's a very big and varied state but
if you
&gt; want I can suggest routes you can take in a bus and never, ever
forget.
&gt; Staggering scenery. But note that public campgroups are rare in New
Mexico,
&gt; private campgrounds are not common either, and expansive, well
maintained,
&gt; well appointed campgrounds of the sort you find frequently in (say)
&gt; Colorado are quite unknown. You have to be the sort who can drive up a
&gt; logging road and wing it.

I'll second what Ken said, and add:

Motels are more plentiful than campgrounds and not all that expensive
unless you insist on the &quot;AAA approved&quot; variety.  Folks are, for the
most part, very friendly and helpful.  Check out my trip report from
last year for more specifics about New Mexico and Arizona.  Search the
archives for the string &quot;summer vacation&quot; and look at parts 3 and 4.

Both New Mexico and Arizona include a lot of terrain that is far from
being desert.
