Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Magnets

I would assume that Berg's cow magnets don't have enough pull to move
paperclips, but these 'rare earth' magnets have got to cause some paperclip
attraction, wouldn't you think?  My thinking is along the lines of rubbing a
magnet on a screwdriver to magnetize it temporarily.  Not sure if the
parallels are there for the big rare earth mags.

That's why I love the list.  We all have great opinions and fact, and I
value yours as well.  Mine is just that, an opinion.  I have no facts to
base it on, other than hearsay from others.  Hell, I sorta have one on my
bus!  My Kymco sump plate has a little magnet on it.  Haven't seen much
stuck to it, though.

Thanks,

Simon

*It will also magnetize that big ol' spinning thing in there called the
crankshaft.*

The magnets will not attract a paper clip from 6&quot; away, I don't think the
crank will be affected.
Your opinion is appreciated and I don't discount that there could be
other effects but I've seen a lot of commercial compressors and other
industrial applications that have magnets laying right in the oil sumps.
