Subject: Stolen bus in Washington state

I am just passing this along this bus doesnt belong to
me.

Dan 

                      STOLEN VW BUS:


Here's the scoop - please pass on wherever it might do
some  good.  I'mon the road working - it's
construction season - in Mt.Vernon, and have
been informed my Green 1978 Westie (white poptop with
kayak  bars) was stolen 
last night from the parking lot at Unlimited V-Dub. 
On the one hand, it's probably joyriders and I'll
get it back - on the other hand, I might not.  And
lord 
knows what torments Loki's suffering now.

Particulars:Stolen Wednesday night, September 18 or
early the 19th, from Unlimited
V-Dub on Rosewood in Orchards, Washington.
Green van with white poptop and a Yakima canoe rack
with  76&quot; bars -rather hard to miss.
Washington license #217 NUB.  The VIN is 2382138765.
Other distinguishing characteristics:  the cabinet
fronts have beenpainted a hideous green. There's a
Century propane stove mounted on wire
  stand behind the passenger seat.  There's a bunch of

 gloriously striped bed linen piled up in back.  My
brand-new Craftsman  ratchet's under the
green VW repair manual is on  the floor.
The carpet is shag puke-brown-and-orange-tan-gross. 
The  pump and fuel bottle from a nearly-new MSR
mountaineering stove is in 
                     
The police were notified by me and by the shop at
about 
noon on Thursday, 9-19-02.
If sighted, call 911 - that's what they told me to do.

                      Thanks,

                      John Axford
                      360-608-7799
