Subject: Stewart Warner South Wind Gas Heater Manual and parts list
  available. + VW/Audi Troubleshooting guides

Hi all,
 
Just found this item that I bought a few years ago and thought that some 
of you out there may be able to use it. It is in new condition and 
covers the southwind line of gas heaters. I think I paid $10 dollars for 
it so would like to re-coup some of that. Will send out to the first off 
list response. Thanks


P.S. Also have the following trouble shooting guides available
VW/Audi Automatic Transmission 003 and 010 - Orange cover
VW/Audi Automatic Transmission troubleshooting ( Rabbit/Scirocco, 
Dasher, Type2, Audi Fox, Audi 100 LS, Audi 5000) brown cover
VW/Audi  CIS fuel injection troubleshooting. (Dasher, Rabbit, Scirocco, 
Audi Fox, Audi 100LS, Audi 5000) Ornage cover.
