   No, people don't modify the engine (usually) internally. That's one
of the problems with changing from FI to carb, tho -- the cam for the FI
is different as well as the valves, and this causes problems, such as
the engine running too lean at high speed. You can compensate for this
with bigger jets in the carb, but then you run too rich at low speed --
better than burning the valves out from running too lean, but still not
good, or economical. 
    Best solution is to put the FI back in, if possible. I was able to
get my Weber progressive and 050 dizzy to run pretty well, but I sure am
happy I went to the trouble of putting in FI and learning how to
troubleshoot it --- just plain major better!
