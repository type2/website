&gt; REGARDLESS I can't stress enough to replace the
&gt;lines ON THE INJECTORS, a lot of people don't and they aren't any
&gt;miraculously better than the rest.  In fact they are often real loose
&gt;on the injector as that crimped ferrule isn't really as well done as
&gt;it should be.  YMMV.

I concur with John on this one.  Replacing the lines on the injectors was
somewhat of a pain, but extremely important.  Mine were very loose and
easily pulled off the metal fuel rail even with the clamps on and tightened
all the way down. On my 76 Westy I used the German hose clamps and Mercedes
Benz fuel line which seemed to work fine.  It took nearly 3 meters of line
for the complete job, but much of that was in the unpressurized section from
the tank to the fuel pump.  Although the line from the tank to the pump is
unpressurized it was the most rotten of all the line on my bus.  When I
started to remove it from the tank it just broke off right at the end of the
metal fitting on the tank.  By the way I used Vaseline to help with the
installation of the line onto the fittings.  Since it's petrol based it
works well and does no harm.  Also makes the job much easier. Good Luck.
