Subject: Re: Back from Mammoth, carb thoughts (long)

&gt;I did mine because the stock carbs wouldn't idle. Given it again, I 
&gt;would probably do it... but I'd try a bit harder to get the stock units 
&gt;to run first. Balancing carbs isn't difficult... but must be done 
&gt;regularly to get the best performance results.

Thanks for all the advice. My stock solex's perform quite well... my van
idles and starts easily.. I really don't have much trouble from the
Solex's...except hard acceleration when cold...(especially below freezing...
takes a couple blocks to heat up enough) otherwise they perform admirably.

I keep my van, like all of my other vehicles I have owned (67' Chev 283
Pickup, '66 Mustang 289, 74' Jimmy (350 Hi-PO)) in well-tuned condition...
It just doesn't pay to skimp on not changing the oil, or maintaining proper
engine timing and dwell. Especially in a performance machine like a VW..
where everything synchs together.

I think I will stick with the Solex's by the sounds of it... I just thought
if I adapted to the Holley, I could get that neat new Holley carb with FI...
yeah Holley made a FI retro for carb engines. The advantage of that is the
lean/rich mixture was controlled by a knob on a box that sits under your
seat for altitude adjustment. It worked really well in the old 4x4's.

I guess the old adage goes, &quot;if it ain't broke... don't fix it&quot;..
