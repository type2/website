Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Engine tin screws

&gt; For those of you with the slotted screws, try breaking the frozen grip
&gt; they have on the tin with vise grips before destroying them with that too
&gt; small slotted screwdriver.

OR, you could give the stuck screws a paraffin wax treatment before you use
the BIG screwdriver to turn them. I am still amazed at how well the wax
works itself under and into the threads.

I try not to use vice-grips myself, as they could possibly mangle a screw
beyond screwdriver use if not being careful. But sometimes they are the best
tool for the job.

YMMV
