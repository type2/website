Hi Volks,

I found a nice little pool of water on my rear deck after another Seattle
rain.  The rear hatch seal is old, hardened, etc.  I found another (used)
seal at Bry's and got it out of the wreck intact.  The price for a new seal
is beyond my means right now.

I checked the archives and there didn't seem to be any 'generally
recommended' product or method for revitalizing the seal.  I wondered if
anyone head any profound successes at this.  The best advice I found was
coating it in a thin layer of silicone.  Any particular brand or type that
works best?

Also, what do you recommend as far as glue to hold it to the frame channel?

Thanks in advance!
