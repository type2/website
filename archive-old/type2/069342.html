&gt; Subject: Paint code location

&gt; Can somwone please tell me where the paint code would be located
&gt; on my 81 vanagon. I have a code but when I went to the VW shop to
&gt; buy some touchup, the color that I would describe as yellow is
&gt; officially &quot;ivory&quot;. ...snip

Weston,

If your '81 has it in the same location as my '84, there's a
computer-printed paper sticker on the body, under the fuse box on
the left side of the (LHD) steering wheel, just inside the
driver door.

My '84 has a code of LH8U; the touch-up paint officially calls it
Bronze Beige Metallic, but it's brown by any other reckoning, so I
wouldn't be surprised that yellow is officially ivory.
