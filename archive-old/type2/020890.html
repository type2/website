Subject: pulling my heads
References: &lt;200104101519.IAA50733_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

 
I have a recurring issue as of late with one
cylinder's valvetrain coming out of adjustment.
 
All signs point to the seat going south, so
I need to pull the engine and have a look
see (correct?)
 
The engine is a GEX rebuild with 55k on it. I did
a lot of mountain travel this past summer, and
I guess I overpacked.
 
Aside from that, the engine had plenty of power.
 
Should I think about splitting the case and checking
out the internals?

My current plan is check the heads, replace as needed.
While I am in there, I have the rocker shaft assembly
from an 81, so I'd like to convert to hydraulic lifters.
 
I know the plan is mechanically sound, but I don't
have the experience to gauge the appropriateness of
cracking the case to check things out at this time
in the engines life.
 
I'm guess I'm looking for advice as to how far I should
take this...

thanks
matt
