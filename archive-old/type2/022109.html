Me too. I'm a poor college student too. I think I have about $50 invested
in my injection system. New rubber everywhere, several cans of carb cleaner
to sterilize everything, and new clamps for all. New filter too. That
doen't include service manuals and a cheap digital multimeter. 

Keep your eyes open for a spare injection system from a parts bus. Those
things are invaluable for switching parts out - doubt your computer? Try
the other one. You get the idea. I got mine in trade to a frustrated bus
owner who just wanted a carb conversion kit - which I managed to have a
spare one of (used). Come to think of it that's how I got my bus - the PO
had it three days after buying it from the OO - orignal owner - and decided
it would be impossible to fix the troubled injection system. I bought the
Bentley's manual, had the Haynes manual (didn't like it much), and later
bought the Bosch manual (two months after I fixed the bus) and then spent a
week chasing vacumn leaks, disabled my EGR valve, and replaced all the
injector seals ($5). Then I was able to tune it and haven't done much to it
since - 20K miles ago. 20 mpg+ (saw 23 once). 

If you need help I'll be here.
