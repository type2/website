Subject: Re: Timing the 78' engine

You can try setting the timing to the factory setting
but if the engine has been rebuilt the factory setting
may very well be worthless. Unless the rebuilder did a
good job and kept the compression ratio at or lower
then stock you can destroy your engine at the factory
setting. 

So, what can you do?

Try the factory setting for a short drive and check
the oil temps and if there is any sign of pinging. Its
ok? Then you are very lucky. If the oil temps is too
high and there is pinging under load set it latter and
try again. Today its the only way!
