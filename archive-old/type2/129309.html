Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

There was a huge debate on timing your distributor.  Some people think 
that you're supposed to time it according to the distributor, but I 
think that's wrong.  I believe that you want to time you distributor 
according to the engine model because the engine is the limiting factor, 
here.  It's the engine that's going to explode for being over-advanced, 
not the distributor.

My theory is also further supported by the fact that the idle timing 
specs are listed in the bentley (you do have a bentley, don't you?) 
according to engine number, NOT distributor model.  And the idle timing 
ultimately determins the *max advance* allowed for that engine, given 
it's the correct distributor for that engine model.

So, what is the engine number on your bus?  Or, what letters does it 
start with?  CB, AW, CD, etc..?

&gt; Well theres a vacuum canister, so it must be the normal distributor.  I 
&gt; dont have a hose that fits the vacuum advance right now, so I have it 
&gt; plugged at the carb.  Should that make much of a difference at idle? I 
&gt; wouldnt think so.  Im gonna go attack all the intake connections, as 
&gt; suggested, with a can of WD-40 and see if the engine goes wild.
&gt; It was mentioned that the 009 should be timed at 7.5 advanced, but then 
&gt; that you should time for the engine, not the dist.  So should the 
&gt; regular be at 7.5 advanced too?  The haynes says 5 after, which just 
&gt; seems odd to me.
