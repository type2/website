Subject: Re: [T2] front door rubber

Dan,

Didn't use the oevduub seals but had the same problem...do you have the 
same problem with the window open?

If so, it's just the seals and if you close the door firmly it will close.

I put mine over a year ago and they are just now loosening up...this is 
good!  Do check your clearance though just in case.

Cheers, dave

&gt; My problem is this - it's _really_ hard to close the door completely. I
&gt; know these seals will settle over time, but I have to SLAM the door to
&gt; make it close flush. I wouldn't normally be overly concerned, except that
&gt; this is really supposed to be the correct seal and I want to make sure
&gt; things are right. 
&gt; 
&gt; Normal? Or is this a problem?
