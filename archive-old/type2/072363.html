Subject: Of mice and Type2s

&gt;Good morning volks!
&gt;
&gt;Tomorrow is the day for me to drive home my new '76 Westy and guess 
&gt;what?...I have a question.  The bus has been sitting on a wooded lot 
&gt;for about a year and has a family of mice living in it.  What tipped 
&gt;me off?...lots of mice excrement and a mouse franticly trying to 
&gt;escape the engine compartment when I started it last.
&gt;
&gt;So, I know DeCon is a bad method.._dot_dead smelly carcasses and such, 
&gt;how would you lovely individuals rid my new beauty of the mice 
&gt;colony.  I know where the nest is, so I figured I would start there. 
&gt;I was hoping they would all just bail out on the hour drive home, 
&gt;but I'm sure that won't happen.
&gt;
&gt;A friend suggested parking it in a large mall parking lot...since 
&gt;they have to leave the bus to go somewhere for food...maybe they 
&gt;just wouldn't come back.

The mice like the malls, a lot of variety of at the food court.

I had a similar mice problem a few years ago.

I was camping a few years ago with the previous owner of my van and 
we driving down the mountain to home. Actually she was driving. 
Anyway shortly after we started out, a field mouse began running 
frantically left and right across the leg wells. It was like the 
mouse was in a panic screaming &quot;Oh my God! what is happening! Oh my 
God!&quot; We both started laughing and looked for a safe place to pull 
over. The mouse by then had found his way to the back and disappeared.

This is what we did to get rid of it. Placed a catch-them-alive type 
of trap in the bus. We baited the trap, but did not set it and after 
a few nights the mouse figured out that it could safely eat the bait. 
Then we set the trap and the next morning the mouse was in the trap. 
My friend took the mouse out to the canyon and let it go.

Now I once had lizard living in my Nissan pickup for 6 months. Like 
the mouse, I must have acquired the lizard while camping. I had the 
seats out and all sorts of things trying to catch that lizard. 
Everyone once in a while I would open the door and the lizard would 
be on the seat or someplace, but it would quickly dash off. Then one 
day on while another camping trip I noticed it sitting motionless on 
the floor and I was able to cover it with plastic bowl. I slipped a 
piece of cardboard under the bowl and was able to contain the lizard. 
I walked him out of camp and let him go.
