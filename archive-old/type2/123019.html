Subject: gas tank vents

I'm curious about the T connector you have in your van.  My two vent tubes
were just hooked together with an L shaped hose.  When it cracked last
summer it filled the entire interior of the van with a very strong smell of
gas.  I replaced it with a length of tubing from the local NAPA store and
it
works fine again.  Should I really be hooking this whole thing up to the
charcoal canister??

_----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is probably happening here is that your gas cap does not seal airtight
and so you are venting the tank via the cap, or you have another one of the
hoses in that system with a leak. It could be in a location that does not
cause noticeable fumes but I suspect the first situation. Think of the vent
system like the vent on a jerry can of gas. If you try to fill your tank
without opening the vent on the jerry can it will take a long time and your
jerry can will look like the water cooler everyone here likes to congregate
around, glub glub glub. The reason for the charcoal canister is to filter
(sort of) the fumes from your tank before they get sucked into the engine.
Venting to the atmosphere is not the greatest solution either because you
have a fire hazard IMHO. There are diagrams on the web and in Bentley that
show how this system is supposed to be run. I was missing the hoses from
the fan housing to the canister and from the canister to the air filter
box. I got some clear plastic tubing from Home Depot that fit well and some
hose clamps and was set. I am running a 2.0 FI motor. I also have the small
piece of vacuum hose attached to the diaphram on the air filter box that
opens when the engine is running to vent the system .  You may have a
different bus altogether so I am not sure exactly how to tell you to hook
up this system, therefore I defer to Bentley. IMHO this sytem is very
important for safety anf environmental reasons.
