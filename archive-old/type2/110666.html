Subject: Aren't ALL bay windshields the same?

I just broke a windshield trying to install it _at_#$*&amp;_at_!
I was trying to put a 79 windshield into a 72 bus and
it just wasn't fitting exactly right, so I forced it
and CRRRAAAACCCKKKKK!!
Aren't all bay window windshields the same??? Why
wouldn't the 79 windshield not fit on the 72 bus??
Anyone got an extra windshield?
