Subject: Clockwise or Counter-Clockwise?

I've had a '70 bus for several years now, and whenever I do the valve 
adjustment, I follow the Muir procedure to the letter, however I have 
to turn the engine clockwise to get the right valves into adjustment 
position.  I've done it this way for years, and the bus runs great.

I bought a '66 bus last summer, and went to do my first valve 
adjustment on it, and found that after I adjusted the first set of 
valves per Muir, I had to turn the engine counter-clockwise to get the 
right valves into adjustment position.

Muir says counter-clockwise (I checked again today, and looked through 
the archives for another case like mine).  I tried counter-clockwise on 
my '70 today, and there's no way it was going to work.  The first pair 
of valves adjusted fine, but when I turned the engine 180-degrees 
counter-clockwise, the second valve from the front was under tension 
(even with the screw completely backed out).

Does anyone have an idea what this means?  (Yes, I'm sure this is a 
Volkswagen.)

Thanks,

Jonathan
