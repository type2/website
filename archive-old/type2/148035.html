Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance

We are on Metlife. $110 per year per car for my wife and myself for
minimum legally required insurance only.

We heard motorhome and classic insurance was cheaper, but we have
found no insurers for less. I think we found a classic company that
had reasonable limits on driving, but wouldn't take us because we
don't garage our cars.

&gt; Just wondering what insurance deals people have found on their daily
 drivers.  I just got a quote from progressive and they want $499 for
 six months!

&gt; Do you have any preferred insurers out there?
