&gt; It actually lets you add those to your &quot;order&quot;. I wonder what they'll do
&gt; if you add 2 of each then also add one $20 item (to meet the minimum 
&gt; purchase requirement) and place the order? &lt;evil grin&gt; 

&lt;RANT&gt;
Darn, I checked the &quot;legal stuff&quot; link and makes no mention of price typos
being &quot;covered&quot;.

I kept digging and could find NO page linked from anywhere one might
NORMALLY visit in the course of ordering from their website that covered an
exclusion from having to sell at the &quot;advertised price&quot; in the case of
typographical errors.

The &quot;Legal Stuff&quot; linked from EVERY page just covers them in case you buy a
torque tool and manage to put your kid sister's fingers in the flywheel
teeth just before you lean on the tool (or other such misuses of the things
they sell).

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/legal.asp

Finally, after much digging around I noticed a link WAAAYYY at the bottom
of the &quot;Site Map&quot; page (http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/sitemap.asp) {who
visits the &quot;Site Map&quot; when the freakin catalog is linked from every other
page on the site, including an index search!?!}.

They cover typos on the freaking COPYRIGHT page of all places -- and don't
make it easy to find.

http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/copyright.asp

And, of course, the wonder paragraph:

&quot; Although every effort has been made to proofread all product information
in our online store before posting, we do not accept responsibility for any
typographical errors either in pricing, content, or technical
inaccuracies.&quot; 

That says &quot;We may SAY it fits all type1, type2, type3, type4 and every
watercooled model -- but if you order it and it DOESN'T fit, tough luck.
It's not our fault.&quot;

Or &quot;The listed web price may be $12 when you order but we can charge you
$22 when we ship so long as we make a timely 'correction' to the web
site.&quot;.

&lt;sigh&gt; They could have made it easier to find. Because if I hadn't found it
I would have ordered a full set of jets and complete rebuild kits -- +
something from the main catalog for $20 and then copied the web pages and
challenged them to show it to me in a &quot;conspicuous location&quot;.
&lt;grin&gt;
&lt;/RANT&gt;
