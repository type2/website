&lt;&lt; Any local fabric or upholstery shop     

should be able to help you with that; just pick your color. Of course,

if you want the more fancy, pre-made ones, there are lots of tiendas  

that cater to the local latino population and their automotive        

customizing tastes which will carry the fancier stuff. Not sure what  

it's offically called, though...                                       &gt;&gt;

Been a while since I did any upholstery work on the surrey, but IIRC,
the generic name for that sort of trim is &quot;rick rack&quot;... ?-)
