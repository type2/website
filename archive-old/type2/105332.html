Subject: Re: [T2] exhaust manifold wrapping 

&gt; What is that thing metal wrapping around the exhaust manifold for?
 
It was on the U pipes and exhaust manifolds on 75 thru 78 USA buses.
As far as I can tell, it was a heatshield. 
Would I worry about it? No.
Would I wrap it again with something else? No.
