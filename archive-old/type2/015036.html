&gt;correct? 

Frank, You are correct.

&gt;What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? 

The Type2 engine was a 1600 or smaller. Magnesium case.

The Type4 engine was a 1700 or larger. Aluminum case. There are differences
in geometry, but the overarching design is quite similar. The aluminum case
lasts longer and is conducive to welding, whereas the magnesium case is not
and becomes brittle with age and heat.

There were other major differences, such as the placement of the cooling
fan. In a Type2 engine, the loss of a fan belt is a catastrophe that can
quickly result in a fried engine. In a Type 4, you're loosing generator
power, but your cooling fan is still turning.

The heads were improved IMHO in Type4's. There may be other things I'm
missing, but these are the biggies that come to mind.

Have fun! Joe
