&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Always use Bosch plugs, Champions have an extra thread at the bottom and will carbon up, then when you take the plug out, the carbon in the thread can ruin the threads in the head.&lt;&lt;

I've had good luck with them in 2-stroke dirt bikes, the most
carboniferous environment around.

My Mexican engine came with them, long-reach no less!
