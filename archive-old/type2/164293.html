Subject: Emerson Fitipaldi and his bug

Since it is Friday, thought I would put my toe in the water, and ask if anyone
has any info on Emerson Fittipaldis VW bug with 2, 4 cylinders joined, and put
into a vw Bug Frame, and raced!!  I can't seem to find any info, and would
love to find, and hear a sound byte of that issue.  I remember that his family
had a VW distributor ship in Argentina.  Anyone on the list remember this, and
where said &quot;byte&quot; can be found?
