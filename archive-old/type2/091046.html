Subject: Re: [T2] GO ! ! ! (please)

not always possible... if i have cars behind me, i am not going to stop
at the top and wait for the front car to get ahead of me, thereby forcing
traffic behind me to pile up and cause generally unnecesary congestion
(not to mention a bunch of angry motorists)...

sometimes i can not anticipate the car in front of me going as slow as
they sometimes go. i am constantly amazed by how horribly some people
drive... totally oblivious to the fact that they are NOT the only people
on the road. when they get to the end of the ramp, they just expect to
get on... regardless of other drivers in that lane NOT wanting to let
them on. maybe it is just Tulsa drivers...

but in general, i agree with you... i DO try to hold back IF i see the
person seems to be taking their time AND there is no one behind me... or
whenever otherwise possible. but like i said, it isnt always an option.

waving to all the bad drivers around here (just won't tell you which
finger),
chris, the girlie, but not always ladylike one

ps~ the bit about one's leg in the other person'a trunk was funny, too.

&gt; &gt; like when i am trying to USE the entrance ramp to gain speed and the
*^%$^%*&amp;^
&gt; &gt; in front of me waits til the END of the ramp to figure out where thei
accelerator 
&gt; &gt; pedal is... i get so frustrated that i end up pushing my bus way
harder than i should,
&gt; &gt; trying to get around them. 
&gt; 
&gt; My solution, which may not apply to all personalities: if I'm entering
a
&gt; freeway and the driver in front of me isn't using the on-ramp properly,
&gt; I'll slow to a crawl at the TOP of the ramp and wait until they're out
&gt; of the way, then use the full length of the ramp to accelerate to
&gt; freeway speed and execute a proper merge.  It's a lot cleaner than
&gt; trying to make my Bus do something that's not in its blood.  I'm
&gt; guessing that this procedure also greatly reduces the chance of leaving
&gt; one's legs in the next guy's trunk on the way to the hospital.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; 
&gt; - Miles
