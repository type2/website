Hi all

Thankyou for all your help.

My 2litre carb type IV engine now has a nice new mechanical
fuel pump. Without dropping the engine. Phew!!

The pump itself was very easy 20mins including replacing
the fuel line, and filter.

The offensive tinware was infact a preheater duct feeding warm
air into the airfilter, for when the engine is cold.

The offensive tinware screw could only be reached with a long
flat blade screwdriver, as the shaft on a similar crosshead has
a larger diameter and could not fit past the obstacles to reach
the screw squarely.  The screw itself only came loose after much
soaking in penetrating oil, and on my last attempt when I believed
the head was chewed too much and my nice new expensive screwdriver
had a lovely twisy on the end.

I can now drive in peace without holding onto my fire extinguisher,
with one eye permanently on the wing mirror.
