&gt; Looking at some of the recent posts about somebodies
&gt; air cleaner woes prompts this question: underneath and
&gt; forward on the pass side on my motor is some sort of
&gt; rectangular can that is mostly rusted away but has the
&gt; remains of what looks like some kind of filter. From

&gt; being rusted out like that. What purpose did this
&gt; filter serve and what kind of degraded performance am
&gt; I likely experiencing?
&gt;
&gt; While I'm at it, I am experiencing an oil leak in the
&gt; area of #3 cyl. The oil appears to drip onto the
&gt; tin for a closer inspection, but I would suspect
&gt; perhaps the tube one of the #3 valve lifters resides
&gt; in. Make sense?

&gt; Is it fixable w/o removing the engine,
&gt; if this is indeed the source?

yes!
yes!
&amp;
yes!
