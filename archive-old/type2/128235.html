Subject: accelerator cable stuck

What do you do when you are trying to remove your old
accelerator cable and it gets stuck less than halfway
out.  It pulled out about 2-3 feet but will not budge
anymore.  We measured and know approximately where it
is stuck.  Is our only option to try and cut through
the cover to get at it where it is stuck?  If so, what
the hell do you have to have to cut through the cover?
 We have tried sawing through it with a hack saw, but
as it is surrounded by other cable lines, etc.... it
is pretty hard to get at it that way.  Any other
suggestions?
