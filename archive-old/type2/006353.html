It's after 2am and I'm just getting home... why?   My ever-faithful friend
Gus (my '72 Riviera) quit on me an hour away, in the pouring rain, with my 5
year old in the bus with me.  I'm headed back for it tomorrow to get it
running (I don't believe in tow trucks... at least not when insurance
doesn't cover it!) and am hoping for some advice on things to check. (I
know, I know...... I should have AAA)

Symptoms:   At the exact moment I turn on my windshield wipers the Generator
light comes on.  Thinking this is odd, I move the windshield washer switch a
little to the left and right and BLINK, off goes the light.  Problem solved,
right?  At least until it's daylight and I get home to find whatever funky
little short has caused this phenomenon.   Fast forward 3 hours later, we
had just come out of the monster truck show (alright, no VW's in
attendance... but what-the-heck, it was fun!) and when I turn the key, no
generator light.  The dummy light wouldn't light before I cranked the
engine.   But lo and behold, a few seconds after running and CLICK it's on
now!   You already know how the story ends.... I make it just out of the
parking lot and lights begin to dim, engine dies, I'm pushing a bus in the
rain in a post-event traffic jam.

The theories of a virtual idiot:   (I'm the idiot, by the way, I left with
no tools!  They were in my parts bus from removing stuff earlier that day).
When I reached under the dash to feel around for whatever could be the
trouble, it was wet.  Like my recently installed windshield washer system
was leaking in to the switch.   Could this have caused a power drain?   I
also notice that when I installed said wiper switch, I had it in cockeyed so
that a terminal MAY have grounded on the body metal.   Am I correct in
assuming that some part of the Generator circuit runs through the wiper
switch?   Am I wrong?  Am I off my rocker?  Am I up WAY to late to be
posting anything sensible?   Probably so.
Anyway, whatever help any of you may be able to give me in troubleshooting
this one, I'd greatly appreciate it.  After all, I don't have internet
access beneath my bus, in the rain, on the side of a busy street, 60 miles
from home.....   :(

PS. If your bus is running today... give it a nice big hug and warm wet kiss
right on the VW logo.   It may remember it next time it's raining late at
night and your alarm is set to go off the next morning at 6am for work!
