Subject: tyre life

	An old taxi driver/proprietor in my city racked up a 
half-million mi  on one car (small Vauxhall).  Needless to say, he 
used re-refined oils.  Also he told the media he'd got far more mi on 
tyres by buying them a year or two ahead, storing them under his 
house.
	If you can get a proper tyre (defined by the excellent Ron), 
and if you don't need max grip, why not try this free tyre life 
boost?  Money in this investment will beat money in the bank for 
added value.
	Modern rubber compounds are much softer, giving much more 
grip  -  but at the price of faster wear.  As a sicklist I'd say 
they're the biggest change in motorsickling this past half-century. 
Faster cornering is due mainly to these sticky rubbers  -  but they 
can wear out in 5000 mi which, in the absence of the legendary 
Bruce's recaps  -  is rotten economy.  Just buying them ahead and 
storing in a cool place looks a shrewd investment.
