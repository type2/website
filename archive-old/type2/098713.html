Subject: Re: [T2] Pushrod tube leak

&gt;&gt;I'm sure whatever Ron is selling is the correct type for you to order.&lt;&lt;

i would agree with this as well as the good advice offered on the
other replies.

however, if your tubes are not cracked/bent/whatever, then you can probably
re-use them. what you probably need is just new seals, not new tubes.

also don't forget some high-temp grease (or other similar item of
your choice) on the seals before installing.

oh yeah one more thing: make sure the motor is _cold_ before
attempting this. the rocker arm assemblies can stay hot for quite
a while after the motor is not running. (AMHIK)

good luck,
