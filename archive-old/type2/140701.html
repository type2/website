Subject: RE: [T2] &quot;Splittie on Toboggan&quot; Hooded Sweatshirt

	So the $300.00 wasn't a typo?  That's a bummer cause I bet there are
quite a few people who would have bought one if it was reasonably priced.
$300.00 will get me a print on 50+ hooded sweatshirts here at my local print
shop (not that fancy Egyptian cotton though.)

Diggin the cards Wayne.

&quot;Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience.&quot;

OK, so it's a plug for my wife's cards... but they won't cost you $300
either ;-)
