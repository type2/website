Thanks for the tip Karl. The PO had already cut a hole and covered it with a
round plate held down with screws, I had assumed it was a repair and hadn't
bothered to look closely at it. Under the plate was the sender unit as you
described, unfortunately the area around it was dry and dusty so i don't
think that it's the source of my leak.

I've pretty much ruled out the filler neck, as it doesn't leak when it's
being filled, which leaves the vents for the breather pipes (I'd always
wandered what those pipes running up the inside of the side air vents were
for). John Anderson mentioned an inspection hatch in the inner right
fender - I can't find one, but inside the engine compartment on the right
hand side opposite the well for the spare tire, is a round black piece of
tin a bit like the lid on a can of paint. It looks like it could be prised
open but I don't want to mess with it until I'm sure what it is - does
anyone know? I'm resigned to taking down the firewall to get to the vents on
the fuel tank, which is a bit more of a job than I can handle at the moment.
I'll keep you posted.

Cheers

&gt; I agree with all the posted help, but everybody missed
&gt; one other possibility (besides a tank metal rupture) -
&gt; the rubber gasket directly on the top of the tank, you
&gt; actually w/out removing the tank, but damaging the
&gt; interior sheet metal, can cut a rectangular hole
&gt; 6&quot;X10&quot; above the tank just about in the middle bahind
&gt; your back seat (hey if its an emergency, what the
&gt; heck) and then look directly down on the tank gas
&gt; gauge sender - if you filled the tank you will see gas
&gt; bubbling out - hence it will be coming out on both
&gt; sides of the tank as you described , solution : go to
&gt; the dealer for a new gasket and replace. The sending
&gt; unit is a little tricky to get back in so mark the
&gt; original position very clearly before you take a big
&gt; screwdriver and dislodge it(it pushes to rt or lt
&gt; before it releases). So let me know if that was your
&gt; problem.
&gt; Klaus     Oh yeah, put out all cigs, disconnect
&gt; battery, ank keep that fire extinguisher handy
