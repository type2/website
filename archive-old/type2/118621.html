On a 70 or earlier (haven't owned a later one) get out your flat bladed
screwdriver (preferably the German one which was made to fit the slot in the
forward pulley half) and place the blade in the slot so that when you place
a wrench on the pulley nut the screwdriver blade wedges against the
generator through-bolt head  and prevents movement of the pulley - or skip
the above and use an impact wrench.

&gt; How the heck do you get the pulley off a generator?  I should say do you
&gt; have any reccommendations.  I've done it before, but this one is a bear!
