Subject: [T2] Combi? and introductions


&gt; Just curious, can anyone tell me what a 'Combi' is?  I'm in the
&gt; learning stage here, and am hoping to buy a Westy in the near future.


A Kombi is basically a passenger bus or Transporter as they are sometimes
also called. Try looking here
 http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/archives/dic/index.mv  it will give you a good
start on some of the terminology of the VW world.



&gt; By the way, I'm new here.

Welcome! I am somewhat new here also and you have found the right place for
great info and help.


I'm in Salt Lake Utah (actually a suburb
&gt; but its all the same) and am hoping to buy a type 2 westfalia
&gt; sometime this summer.  I'm mechanically inclined (used to own a
&gt; Jeep...you gotta learn to wrench on those!)


I have a '78 Westy and love it. It's my daily driver. Once you learn your
way around them they are fairly simple to work on and maintane.
I used to own an '86 CJ7. It was my baby for eight years before I sold it.
Just didnt drive it enough any more to justify keeping it. Got lots of pics
of it and I like to show it off.
