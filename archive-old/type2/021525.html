&gt; Hey.  It's the middle of summer and I FINALLY got my bus put together,
&gt; running, and in the garage.  Woo hoo!!
&gt;
&gt;    Ok so I have two questions.  The first one is:  What is the sensor
&gt; that mounts near the back of the flywheel?  What does it do, and what
&gt; happens when it hits the two little studs it's supposed to sense?
&gt;

  I don't know much about the sensor, but I have heard It has something to do
with VWs' Computer Diagnostic System. The dealers could hook your bus up to
thier system an check most everything very quickly.

&gt;    The second question:  My bus now makes a squeaking sound, all the
&gt; time.  It seems to be coming from the clutch area, but I can't be sure.
&gt; It's got a new clutch, and I took the engine apart and put in lots of
&gt; new seals.  Anyone had this problem before, or know what it is?

&gt; Did you change the throwout bearing when you had the engine out? I have
&gt; always made it a practice to change the T.O. bearing any time an engine is
&gt; removed, no matter what kind of vehicle. When the clutch disk is replaced
&gt; the geometry of the T.O. bearing changes just enough to cause it to squeal
&gt; or squeek if it's worn much at all.

&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; Tom
