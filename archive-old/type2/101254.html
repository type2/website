Subject: Re: [VB] Full-length rack for sale

That looks like a 50s version, at least that was what I was told that kind 
is.  Used a rack like that to haul a ton of stuff a thousand or two miles.    
But thought about attaching wood slats length wise, as it does bow down in 
the middle when you load it a lot.

 Then when someone says &quot;nice rack&quot; you can point to the top of
 your bus and say &quot;Why, thank you!&quot;
