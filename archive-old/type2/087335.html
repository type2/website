Subject: Where to get fuel tank??

Unfortunately, here in Ohio, finding a bus in a junkyard is a little difficult, the old needle in a haystack comes to mind!  Anyone ever use that fuel tanker sealer junk from Por 15??  Any advice.  So what's the deal, is it ABSOLUTLEY IMPOSSIBLE to find one of these from a vendor?
Peace, John baker

&gt; Allright, what gives?!?!  I have searched ALL of the online parts vendors and cannot find the fuel tank I need for my 71 Westy (mine was leaking buckets!).  They have tanks for everything but 68-71 buses.  Anyone know where I can get one???
