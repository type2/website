Subject: Re: cv joint grease

You can use just about any grease to repack the CV, but who knows what
sort of life it will have.

I wish I could find a reference that showed the difference between CV
grease, Moly Grease, and ordinary wheel bearing grease.  I buy the little
tubes of CV grease, but have the vague feeling that I am being ripped off.
Still, the reciprocating loading of CV joints seems to demand something a
bit special in lubrication.

If the tube says CV joint grease, it is probably OK for your bus.
