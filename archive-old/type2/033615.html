Subject: Re: My 914 bus/longish

Oh, so many questions.......

I have put a '76   - 2.0L into '72 T2 I just bought and hopefully anticipate
the experience of millennium T2.

Question: Are the any differences between a VW 2.0L and a 914  2.0L ?

&gt; &gt;&gt;Does any one have any suggestions as to wich route to take in
&gt; &gt;&gt;their experience?
&gt; &gt;&gt;The 914 rebuild(2.0) or 1700 stock?
