If your paint is really oxidized you'll need to get some rubbing compound to
cut it down to the good paint.  There are a couple of grades from coarse to
fine (Maguires is the best) and you'll have to be the judge on which to use.
If you use coarse you may want to buy the fine as well to go over the whole
thing a second time to take out the scratches that the coarse compound will
create.  The pros use a buffing wheel but I've never trusted myself to use
one and not go all the way through the paint with it.
