Subject: Re: [T2] tranny whine

&gt;hi all - last week i got around to replacing the shift rod 
&gt;coupler. shifting improved, but now i have a new issue. ain't 
&gt;that the way it is? on the test drive i found i have a whine 
&gt;sound that happens in 4th gear at 50 mph. the sound is like 
&gt;a jet plane taking off, or really loud snow tires. 

Did you replace the coupler with the &quot;upgraded&quot; polyeurothane (sp?) coupler
or the cheap rubber one.  I can tell you from experience that the cheap
rubber ones shifts just as well and does NOT transfer nearly as much noise
from the tranny through the linkage and into your interior.
