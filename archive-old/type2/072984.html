Subject: Urgent need for parts

AKA &quot;Cashing in some busma points&quot;

I need bolts for the bumpers and rear apron for the 69. I'm assuming I
won't be able to put the moustache bar in until I get motor mounts? I don't
want to Mickey Mouse these parts on for appearances's sake, because I don't
want to risk having them fall off if I'm towed again. The rear bumper still
has its splash guards.

With all this bureaucratic wheeling and dealing, I won't have time to get
to the junkyard this week.

I'm off to deal with the LAPD to get a hearing for No Probable Cause on the
towing fees (and get some digs in on Sgt. Martinez), and hopefully a
refund. Wish me luck....

If I get towed again, the DOT is going to have their hands full towing all
the neighbors' cars out the alley. Yeah.
