Subject: BN-4 Gas Heater ('73 Thing)

Hey People, I need your help!

I need to find the manual for the BN-4 gas heater. This one specifically
is on a '73 Thing, which I know that you'll have some on your busses, so
that's why I am posting this here-- so if you guys have any information,
tips, etc, please don't hesitate to pass them on. This Thing has been
parked for a number of years, but is rock solid, and the heater is
spotless, just doesn't run. It will get cold very soon here, so if
you'll could please get any info to me A.S.A.P.

Thank you very much (I mean it)
John Tracy
'78 Bus and '71 Bus
