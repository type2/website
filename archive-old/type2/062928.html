Subject: Saphire Radio For '71

What's the correct Saphire Radio number for a '71 bus?  I picked up a working
Saphire XI (also known as 11) from the junk yard the other day for $2.00.
 It's an AM and I think I picked it out of a '70 bug.  Is this correct for
stock?  It's missing a face plate and one knob.  Anyone out there want to
sell/trade me for my missing parts?

Is Saphire the correct model (Motorola built) for nearly all VWs up to a
certain year?  I have a friend who says he knows someone through Vintage that
rebuilds Saphires.  Somebody out there must know the scoop on these radios,
what's the big deal?
