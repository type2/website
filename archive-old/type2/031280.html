&gt; engine.  Please no flames here.  Back when they were selling the Type 3's, I heard
&gt; 
&gt; their engine referred to as a pancake engine.  the basic design is a type 1 engine
&gt; with the oil cooler laid on its side to the left, and a rear engine mounted fan
&gt; with cooling tin at a very low profile to fit under the cover of the type 3's
&gt; engine bay.  Carbed to 67 and FI to 1973. VIN starts with 3XX

true, I and my father own em, nice cars

&gt; In the early 70's(?) / late 60's(?) VW introduced the bigger type 4's.  4 door
&gt; sedan, fast back, and station wagon.  These vehicles were equipped with the new
&gt; designed type 4 engine, 1700 cc.  It was needed to push these heavier cars
&gt; around.  At the time of their introduction, the local VW dealer referred to the
&gt; engine as a suitcase engine.  VIN starts with 4XX
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else remember the type 4s?

my wifes 74 412 wagon may have been the best all around air cooled VW ever
made for the average housewife and small family.   Shame the public didn't
quite feel the same way, great car.

of course the 2 liter fuel injected late type IV engine as used in late
buses would have made it an awesome vehicle
