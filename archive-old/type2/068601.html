Subject: '81 Vanagon stumbling problem

 I've been doing a little investigative work on my stumbling '81
 Vanagon and I have a question for the fuel injection gurus on the
 list.

 THE STORY SO FAR:

 Fairly new engine in van.  After engine warms up, engine has a
 tendency to want to die on idle, doesn't &quot;pick up&quot; from idle easily,
 stumbles at mid-throttle after each shift.

 Compression is within specs on all cylinders (significantly lower on
 #3 though).

 I believe ignition is basically OK: new plugs, wires, rotor and rotor
 cap which all spec out OK with ohm meter, and I know timing is within
 spitting distance of correct.  No idle stabilizer, but van ran OK
 without idle stabilizer before.

 Tried checking for air leaks 2 different ways.  First, ran engine and
 pointed unlighted propane torch at all hoses, connectors, etc. with
 no change in engine rpms.  Next, pressurized system at aux air
 regulator and had my wife check for air leaks by ear (once the
 neighbor finally turned off the GD leaf blower) and with soapy water;
 found _minor_ leak around end of one hose from air distribution box
 to intake manifold which I'll fix with hose clamps.

 On a hunch, I checked wire continuity between various terminals and
 the 3-spade ground which lives under the air distribution box (of
 course) and got no continuity on the wire which runs from terminal #6
 of the OXS Relay to ground.  (Current track 9-12).

 I'm not sure what this relay does.  Can anyone clue me in?  Could
 this be the source of my problems?
