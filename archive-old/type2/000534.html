Subject: easiest way to kill yourself?
Message-ID: &lt;000201be8b59$289ed280$7e09883e_at_tps&gt;

hello volks,
    thanks for thehelp on my last problem, I will try and put the theory
into practice as soon as I get a break here.  I now have another question-
seems like all take, take, take from the list for me at the moment, but you
lot are so helpful.  Short of seeming like the easiest way to kill yourself
whilst working on a van, welding next to my petrol tank in lieu seems to be
an easy option.  I'd rather not have to take it out, as I am receiving
complaints about looking like a junk yard already. What I was wondering was
whether anyone would advise against me draining all the fuel out of the tank
and then letting it vent for several days, in open air, before taking on
these welding jobs- around the rear floor panels, wheel arches and engine
bay (from inside the rear wheel arch).  From what I understand it is the
explosive vapour of the fuel which causes the problems- surely if I vent all
the vapour out, welding should be safe-I'm using a mig welder.
    Grateful for any help you can give me- especially if it stops me from
blowing myself up
    cheers
        Tristan &amp; Isolde
