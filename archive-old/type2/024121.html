Subject: poor student's  76 bus needs front axle beam
To: &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I am hoping someone out there can help me out locating a  front axle beam for my bus. It is state inspection time again and this year the front beam has progressed into a pretty bad situation. To make a long story short I need a new front beam as soon as possible. If anyone has one or knows where to find one I will be greatly appreciative. I am planning on going to Buses by the Trail 3 this year and I need to get this cleared up before then. Any and all help would be a blessing. 
you can either email this account, or if you have one please feel free to leave a short message (150 charachters) on my cell. that address is 7172696025_at_mobile.att_dot_net     
I would be willing to drive to pick it up or pay to have it shipped(if it doesn't cost too much)
Thanks again for your help. 
I am located in central PA 

thanks , 
brendan allen

P.s. what years fit a 76 bus beam?
