Subject: CVs - Repacking

Volks,

To all those who thought removing the driveshafts and circlips, taking 
the CV off the driveshaft, replacing the rubber boots, repacking the CVs and 
putting the whole thing back together is something to be put off as long 
as possible (like a trip to the dentist), it's not. I didn't even have to 
have the CVs pressed off the shaft (AFTER I took the whole box &amp; dice to 
my VW man).

Don't put it off, it's not that hard. I had Bentley and Muir open at the 
appropriate pages to help. I didn't even have to ring anybody. 

The books don't say it but when you put the CVs back together there's the 
right way and the wrong way. I was told that if you do it the wrong way 
the joint locks solid. The advice was good, I tried it and it is true.

The books say use 2/3rd of the grease on the inner side and the 
other 1/3rd on the outside. I squeezed the grease out of its tube into a 
plastic container and used an iceblock stick to spread and press the 
grease into the CV. It was easier to estimate the correct quantities of 
grease when it was all out of the tube.

Go for it!
