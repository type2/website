Subject: Breadloaf? v.s. Baywindow / Bubblewindow

I'm sure many of you will think this is petty, but being a diehard VW fan I've
always referred to the body styles of Buses according to the windshield style.  
'50-'67 SPLIT window
and 
'68-'79 BAYWINDOW  or  BUBBLEWINDOW

and (not a bus though,) the term the &quot;Wedge&quot; was used for the Vanagon in the UK
because of it's sharply raking windshield.

Until I joined these lists I had never heard of the term &quot;Breadloaf.&quot;  ( or at
least as unanimously used as it is here on the lists)
I dunno, kinda makes me think of a Bakery van or something. 
Just a observation.....

Hmmm....where's my bus??  I'm getting hungry, 
I think I'll make myself some toast....................
