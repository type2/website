&gt; Upgraded the old incandescents on the bus to GE H6024 halogens, until I

&gt; Now if I could just run down why the alternator light comes on dim when 
&gt; the
&gt; running lights are on, and gets a bit brighter when the headlights are
&gt; turned on (and a bit brighter still when flicking over to the high beams)

With adding the H4's youve also increased the amount of juice needed to run 
them.
I remember reading about this somewhere and am currently looking for it.	
I believe someone once tested the voltage available and the amount needed 
for H4's.
To remedy it would be wise to do a little rewire of your headlights and 
possibly
use a heavier gauge cable for less resistance and avoid the various relays 
inbetween.

Or get used to the glowing Gen light!
