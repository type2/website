Subject: Re: Low Oil Pressure on Rebuild

David,

I think I lost a post I was trying to make to you. 
Thanks for your detailed report on your rebuild.  I
don't feel so bad about low hot idle oil pressures 
now that I see it doesn't necessarily spell short
engine life.

Increasing idle speed is a great idea.  I think it
will work well with my engine since I have the high
volume Melling pump.  Aslo the rebuild idles almost
too slow, so I should be able to pick up 5 psi with a
modest increase in idle speed.  A 5 psi increase
sounds golden.

As for the Germans being infalible, there are stories
about German mechanics having their hands full with
all the Thingmobiles that broke down (exhaust valves?)
in WWII due to the African desert heat.  I'd say
you're doing great with engine life in Texas, which at
times must seem like our equivalent to the African
desert.

Rob
