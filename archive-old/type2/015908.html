What kinda gauges do you  fellers reccomend.  I hope to find some unity
here, but I excpect I'll get a list.

BTW my '71 seems to do o.k. on plain old 30w, I've considered synthetic but
have heard if you have a leak somewhere it'll find it for you, so I figger
some oil better'n no oil. (I don't seem to leak but I don' trust it...it's
got a mean look in it's eye.
