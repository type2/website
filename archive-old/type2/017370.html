&gt; I have a 1978 camper bus.  I do not think it is a westy. it has a straight
&gt; pop up and a RV tag on the side from Oregon anyway the tag says the bus
&gt; weighs 2800 lbs rear and 2251 on the front for a total of 5051 lbs then
&gt; under that it says it can carry an additional 920 lbs.  I know the weight is
&gt; correct because I was on a scale and with me in it it weighed 5260.  I would
&gt; also like to know if anyone is familiar with this camper modification.  The
&gt; vin is for a camper and the RV tag on the side is from 1978, was this a
&gt; dealer or what?  I would like to get a new pop tent and all I can find is
&gt; the slant ones. Help!  I live in Arlington TX between Dallas and Ft. Worth.
