Subject: grrrrr...RE: [T2] Spark Plugs Bosch vs NGK

George/List admins, ya *gotta* do something about the &quot;too many quoted 
lines&quot; program!....I said this yesterday and only 3 people got it, even 
though I tried to snip a lot of content out of the quoted part.




Coming in late on this one as I am out of town.

Listen to Karl....one of the &quot;ole&quot; timers on the vintage vw list who used 
to work for bosch(25 years) says pretty much the same thing.  Standard 
ignitions(and t1 engines) run do not run as well on platinum...Bill also 
says that t1 engines with stock ignition also run *hotter*(on platinum)

If you have a different kind of ignition than standard then all bets 
off...do what you want...if stock with coil, then stick to *non* platinum.


To add to the original comment(now that I am home)...Bill said the Bosch 
folks *gave* them the &quot;new&quot; plugs to try in their cars...

T4 engines may be subtly different than t1, but they both use kettering 
ignitions and are both air cooled.

*If* you have cd ignition with all sorts of other nice fancy stuff added 
on, then you are on your own.  I *can* tell you that I have fouled both 
ngk and bosch plugs with a t1 and dual carbs having to go  slow for 
several miles....otherwise, the engine gets about 26mpg.

Folks, don't be rude about it, if you don't believe the 300+ years of 
experience on the list, then don't ask....or even better yet *go try it* 
and report back...truthfully..


Cheers, dave
