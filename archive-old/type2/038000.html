Subject: El Tonka (Weird)

I was looking through some of my old Usenet posts, and I happened across
this one that I sent to rec.autos.makers.vw.aircooled back in October of
1998 that never received a reply:

Has anyone seen one of these, or have any idea what it is?

Subject: _really_ weird VW...

I'm wondering if the following car I saw a while ago is actually a VW, or
just some sort of weird custom vw-powered thing:

It's a blue pickup truck, front-wheel drive, cab-over-engine type of thing.
It's got a bus transaxle (engine behind TA - it's not backwards or anything)
connected to a set of driveaxles and spindles don't _look_ custom (maybe
Syncro bus?).  The engine looked like T3 ot T4, FI, but it was hard to tell.
The shifter was connected to the front of the TA with a short little
linkage.  Basically, it's like a bus but with the drivetrain in front
underneath the cab, and a big bed and a rear axle in back.  I don't remember
what the suspension looked like offhand, but I think it might've just been a
set of leaf springs.  I remember the suspension being really simple in back.
It has vanagon-looking 5-lug steel wheels, IIRC.  License plate is &quot;EL TONKA&quot;
(the truck).
  
I'll have to get up there (near my parents' house) and take a look at it
again sometime.  It was the _strangest_ thing.

BTW, this was in Northern California.
