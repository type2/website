Subject: 79 oil leak

Hi Mike,
    I just saw your post to the type2 list about your oil leak;

&quot;Well, I finally had it with the oil leak in my '79 Westy - it wasn't
losing much, but enough so that it leaves stains everywhere.  So, I took
off the fan housing to expose the oil pump (my best guess at the culprit).
Close, the leak was actually to the right and down - I believe it is the
end of the camshaft.&quot;

The end of the camshaft is just forward of and actually drives the oil pump. 
  You say the leak is down and to the right of the pump, so it's not the 
camshaft.  If my memory serves me, what is down and to the right of the oil 
pump is an oil passage plug.  It is a round plug, a little less than an inch 
in diameter and is on the rear face of the case.  As for stopping it with an 
external sealant, I doubt it.
