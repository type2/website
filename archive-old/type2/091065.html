Subject: Re: [T2] 1970 westy~sliding door inside handle

poor karl.... i tried to answer him for you to save you the aggrivation,
but i guess you were already writing before i got it posted.

adrian from the full moon bus club has gone to a junk yard where he lives
and found one for me for $5!!! thanks to everyone who offered to send me
one. i wanted to make sure i got the original handle to avoid the problem
jim has. i was afraid all the handles people have offered to send me were
the normal bus one, so i did not take anyone up on their offer until i
knew it was the right one. there was someone else who asked for one,
perhaps someone could help him now, lol.

isnt the internet a wonderful thing sometimes???

thanks again to everyone who offered me a handle,
chris
