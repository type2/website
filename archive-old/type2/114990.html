&gt;       Finally have my 78 Westy ready to take back on road after a few years
&gt; of rest. The trouble is that the nut that holds the steering wheel on is
&gt; missing.(yes thats the only thing &amp; why is it so hard to find?) Someone at the
&gt; VW resting place/local junkyard must of had a use for it before I rescued
&gt; Pete.

So they could mail you one later!

&gt;I tried one off of  an earlier bay window bus but it was different. If
&gt; anyone has one that would work and would be willing to part with it please let
&gt; me know.

I have one for you. If you are in the U.S. send me your address off list and
I will mail it out to you in the morning. Torque it up to 36 ft. lbs. when
you get it. It requires a 24mm socket and strips easily using a crescent
wrench.
