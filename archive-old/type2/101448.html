Subject: 75 bus finally on road; ? about trans noise (trans-shaft?)

Well, after many years of gracing our driveway, the 75 bus bought for my
daughter (just got her license as a h.s. junior) is on the road. The
radio does not work, and we'll leave it this way until she has driven
for a year!  You wouldn't believe the mouse nest material that was on
the cylinders and in the heat ducting.   Due to it sitting so long, the
brakes needed rebuilding, and I got new fuel lines, injectors, fuel
pump, and it also needed the spare 6 pin AFM I had.  The stock &quot;first
edition&quot; FI that Karl believes Bosch goofed on works fine for now- the
spare 78 FI I have is on the shelf.  The heat from the 74 style
manifold/heat-exchangers and 411 muffler is very good.  Here in NJ the
inspection stations are state owned, and they went over the bus very
carefully (I wonder what the sensor was they stuck in through the
doorway and held up as they looked at a screen- a heat sniffer to see if
I had fumes in the heat??????)  It passed without a hitch, though they
remarked about the visible exhaust on startup (I said it was just
rebuilt).
   The engine is a stock 1800 FI, with rebuilt top end and new rod
bearings and switched to hyd. lifters.  Considering the newness of the
P&amp;C sealing, the emissions were half the allowed maximums (144/300 for
HC as I recall).
I needed and bought a used trans that was clean and tight in the
differentials and shift rod input, and Jon, the mechanic, said he had to
use the old bell housing to fit this later 091 trans.  It has what he
calls a noisy input shaft (a bad bearing?) and said it could last a long
time this way.  It's an annoying rpm dependent vibration heard even when
trans is in neutral, and you can feel it through the shift rod and when
touching the clutch pedal lightly.  Depress the clutch all the way, and
the noise stops.  Let off the gas while driving and it also lessens.  Is
this easily fixed, or just wait for it to get worse/fail?  I have 2
extra trannies (74, 77) and will switch if necessary; for now, it's OK
for my daughter to be &quot;learning&quot; shifting and clutching (got her license
on family automatic).  Anyone have experience with this sort of noise? 
Is the input shaft (the transhaft seen when you look at the bell
housing) part of the bell housing or independent of it?  If there is a
vibration in this shaft, can't it be transferred to the flywheel/rear
main bearing??  There is no sign of excessive clutch disk vibration when
letting the clutch pedal back up.
