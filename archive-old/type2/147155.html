Folks,

I just received a phone call from Martin, who is now in a hotel just
north of Richmond, Virginia. His 82 bus started belching black smoke on
US 95 and had to be towed to a garage. Oil all over the spark plugs.

He is looking for some kind soul in the Richmond area who would let him
tow the bus to his place for a while until he figures out what to do
with it. He isn't sure if he wants to fix it, sell it for parts, or put
it on the scrap heap. In any event, he will be headed on to Florida in
the AM, so he will only be reachable for a few hours.

Martin can be reached in his hotel at (804) 448 2011. Ask for room 210.
His cell phone number is 0049 1775385691.

                                       Ron
