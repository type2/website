Best existing tool: a piece of large fuel hose, about 12&quot; long, that I 
use to screw in and unscrew the #4 and #2 spark plugs without worrying 
about dropping them. I put a hose clamp on the working end and adjust it 
just right.

Best when-I-figure-it-out tool: a clamp that holds the oil filler pipe 
rigidly to the fan shroud (2.0L engine) with the dipstick belows 
installed, for installing the whole mess with a single motion.
