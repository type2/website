&gt; Part of the reason why I don't read the VW rags anymore. Redundant and advice
&gt; based on the advertisers' products.

I don't find they even review products completely by following the
instructions. I'd never buy parts from any of those full page advertizers.

Plus the advice they dispense in their letters to editor and tech columns is
amateurish at best. In fact they get a lot wrong.

But I only speak of the US rags. Volksworld from the UK is much better.
