Subject: The Ultimate Urban Legend (little to no VW)

This should be very humorous to anyone who has been on email for a long 
period of time. Sorry for the limited VW content, I just couldn't wait 
until Friday.

                The Ultimate Urban Legend

Craig Shergold is a 10 year old boy who is dying of cancer.  Before he
dies, he would like to set the world record for receiving the most
Neiman-Marcus Cookie Recipes.  You can help Craig by sending an irate
fax to LEXIS-NEXIS demanding that they remove all traces of your
mother's maiden name from their executive washroom wall.  They will
respond by sending e-mail labeled &quot;goodtimes&quot; to the computer
controlling Craig's life support equipment.  When Felippe Linz, the
technician operating the computer opens this mail, his hard drive will
be overwritten with thousands of credit card invoices for $250.00,
erasing the last bit of evidence that Hillary was seen on the grassy
knoll when JFK was shot, thus allowing world domination by Bill Gates
and his tri-lateral commission cronies who are eating fried peanut
butter and banana sandwiches in the black VW Bus with Elvis.
