Sorry for the bandwidth, but somehow I deleated this posting, so please
pmail me if possible...plans have changed, and we may be able to make it
after all.

I recall Nance as one of the organizers, I-95 to 234 rings a bell, but I
can't recall the name of the park or if reservations were
available...it's a long way to go from Toronto if you don't have a site
nailed down...GRIN...

Thanks a lot...Den.
