Subject: Re: [T2] Reverse gear only in an Automatic

&gt; This is actually a Vanagon question, but I am not on

&gt; tranny Vanagon very cheap ($200), it is supposedly in
&gt; good shape and runs EXCEPT that it will only go into
&gt; Reverse gear on the auto tranny.
&gt; SO, is it likely that alll four forward gears would go
&gt; out on a tranny OR is there a good chance that it is
&gt; something minor such as a linkage problem??

if it is the 010 tranny which was used on many but not all vanagons I
think

if no drive in aall forward gears it could be

. 1st gear one way clutch not holding,  ($$$$$$)
. forward clutch plates worn/not holding ($$$$$)
. forward clutch diaphram spring broke  ($$$$$)
. forward clutch piston seal damaged ($$$$$)
. forward planetary gears damaaged ($$$$$)


in other words no cheap fix, unless the shift linkage is completely broken
I doubt if you will get out of it without at least a tranny swap
