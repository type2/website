Hi George

(and others who know the route, especially south of Needles)

I vote for 29 Palms to Parker because I love that desert drive.   But 
as  I/we could not possibly leave at such an ungodly hour as ohdark30 
(when is that?!?)  I have no say for your caravan, whichever route. 
I left downtown L.A. at 8.30am  last year still got to LHC before 4pm 
and it was a great lazy drive. Leapfrogged  with Joy too; she stopped 
for GOOD coffee  in Yucca Valley then caught me further east as I ate 
old sandwiches and drank water :-(( . Wonderfully empty desert roads. 
Anyone as lazy as me and want to meet up on the 29-parker route, or 
look out for each other?

Rte Parker to LHC has a choice, the west side of the river gives a 
good view of all the river homes.

But if your caravan does go 66, where to you plan to stop and gawk, 
walk, eat? -  at Newberry Springs the Bagdad Cafe, imo a must, then 
there is a diner near Dagget, and the Amboy Crater - what is further 
east?

Can you tell me about this - there are no roads showing going south 
from Needles to the actual Needles rocks? Is the only access by 
water? If I could drive in  close to them, I would come with you on 
the northern route (lets be honest, I'd follow and hour or two later)

Like Jim I am busy planning packing etc and i cant find my 
DOUBLEDECKER so panicking already
