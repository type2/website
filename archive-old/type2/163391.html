Subject: Re: [T2] VW Splitty &quot;big&quot; model toy

Get 'em while ya can.  Looks like Maisto has discontinued 'em and Target (at
the stores I checked this week/weekend) are now OUT for good.

I checked w/Maisto last week about getting some for Airhead Parts' toy
selection, but they said Target took most of 'em all and they weren't sure
they'd have any more in the forseeable future.  I picked up a couple
online to donate to the raffle at BBB XI :-)

&gt; &gt; Yeah, these are the Maisto &quot;GRidez&quot; Series.  They're literally
&gt; &gt; flying of the
&gt; &gt; shelves here at the local Target for $49.95, but I've heard it
&gt; &gt; reported that
&gt; &gt; Target Online is selling 'em for as low as $41.  They've been
&gt; &gt; available for
&gt; &gt; about 2 months now.
&gt;
&gt; Post holiday sales...Bus is now $29 and the Bug is $24.
