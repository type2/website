now that you watched to jerks screw it up maybe you could get a refund,
beer and a friend
and DIY. use silicone spray for lube, put the seal in the sun to soften
it, and bunch extra rubber in the lower corners because when it stretches
there isnt enough rubba there to fill the gaps if'n you dont. better yet
bring the stuff and make it a campout windshield party.
