You might try checking to see if the gear shift lever is properly
adjusted and that the rest of the shift linkage is in good condition.
However, what I think is going on is that there is excessive wear
and tear on the 3rd/4th gear slider engagement teeth for 4th and/or
excessive wear on the matching teeth on the 4th gear dogring 
teeth.  If that's the case then there really isn't anything you can 
do other than teardown the transaxle and replace all the worn out
internals.  In other words-rebuild the gearbox.

PS-One more thing but its internal as well.  The 'throw' for the
3rd/4th slider might be off just a small amount and not fully 100%
engaging 4th gear.  Then, under certain conditions, the torque 
is stronger to push the slider off the gear than to lock it onto 4th.
