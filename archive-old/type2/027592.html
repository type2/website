Is the problem the switch or the lock?  From your description of wanting a 
new key, I assume it is the lock.  There is no way to generate a key from 
the VIN.  We can, however, make a key from the lock code.  The easiest way 
to get it is to remove a door handle.  The code will be in the format of 
##R###; 2 numbers, the letter R, and 3 numbers.  If the key you are using is 
extremely worn or poorly cut, it could prevent the lock from turning.  
Please let me know if you need further information on the key by code or the 
lock.
