&gt; YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN METAL SHOP IN HIGH SCHOOL, what were you

&gt; We have a ton of fun in the shop classes and even learn a thing or two that
&gt; really is useful in real life.

I agree.  Metal shop was great!  I learned how to do a lot of things and
got a great understanding of what was possible and not possible with
metal.  It even helped me when I got to college, since I was one of the
few that knew his way around the fabrication shop and therefore had my
run of the place.

When I work on my bus, it sure is nice to have the capability to do some
welding and brazing.  It has saved me a lot of money and has allowed me to
keep original German tin in place of lesser quality aftermarket stuff.

The bad news is that a lot of high schools lack metal shop and many more
are closing their shops when the current instructor retires.  Costs and
liability are high, and it's a lot cheaper to run &quot;paper and pencil&quot;
classes than hands-on classes.  My school currently only has print shop,
automotive, computer networking and drafting in their vocational ed
program.  In the last five years we lost wood, metal, and electronics
shops as the instructors retired.
