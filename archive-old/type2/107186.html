Subject: Re: [T2] Petronix &quot;gap&quot;

&gt; &gt; It was debated earlier that changing the gap makes no difference. The
&gt; dwell
&gt; &gt; should be about 54 degrees with Pertronix at idle. Not sure why your
&gt; reading
&gt; &gt; is so low.
&gt;
&gt; Hmm... Could I have bought a bad module?  What else could be causing a low
&gt; dwell reading?

Ive tried before and have gotten odd dwell readings from a good
functioning pertronix.
Im not sure that its really valid to measure.
