&gt; It's total hindsight, but I wanted to throw this out for general use.
&gt; When putting a new engine in it's always a very good idea to remove
&gt; the oil pressure switch and make sure that the engine will pump oil
&gt; out the opening. Not only can you verify a pump is primed, but even
&gt; more important (like this case) that there is actual oil flow.
&gt;

Hello Jason  I put a mechanial gage in there to get a true reading of the oil 
pressure  and always crank the motor till the pressure starts reading before 
firing the engine.  I had a new type 4 motor that we couldnt get any oil 
pressure and it turned out the the new filter wouldnt allow the oil to flow thur it 
? ?   later and have fun  Mark Dearing
