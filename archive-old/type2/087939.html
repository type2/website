Subject: Re: [T2] RE: hole in tin??

That hole is where the wire for the head temp sensor goes thru on a 75 1800 FI
engine. 76 and up 2.0L, the temp sensor was moved to the tin screw hole next
to the port. Just about all 3/4 upper tin have a plug in that hole, up to the
end of 78?....I have not seen it on 79's.

&gt; When I put my new head on the other day I noticed a hole in the tin of my
&gt; stock FI 2 liter right under the #3intake runner.  hole was obviously
&gt; stock or looked that way and was maybe a inch-inch and a quarter in
&gt; diameter.  ???? what goes there? any easy way to cover it, has gotta hurt
&gt; the #3 cooling
