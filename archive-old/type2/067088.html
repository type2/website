Subject: Red Baywindwo spotted in Beatrice, NE

This afternoon I saw a sight that you don't see very often here in 
Beatrice.  It was a red bay-window heading south through Beatrice, NE  I 
didn't see who was driving it but it did have Arkansas plates on it.  I 
was just ready to pull into a filling station with the lumber yard truck 
when it when by and I had to wait on it - I didn't mind waiting on it either!

You just don't see busses here in town and when one goes by, it sure 
turns heads. :-)

If it was any of you, please let me know....
