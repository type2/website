&gt; Hey Everyone, I have what may be a silly question but
&gt; better safe than sorry.  Before yesterday my steering
&gt; wheel (when i was driving and going straight)has a bar
&gt; across it that was in the mostly horizontal position. 
&gt; Now, today when getting in it is was more at a 45
&gt; degree angle.  I'm under the impression that this is
&gt; not normal.  The only thing that happened between the
&gt; last time I drove her and today was that my roommate
&gt; moved it out of the driveway so she could get her car
&gt; out.  She didn't notice anything funny happening and
&gt; didn't notice what position the steering wheel was in.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a problem?  what should I check out?

This could be serious so check it right away. Something has slipped in the
steering linkage and that shouldnt happen. Make sure to check the flexible
steering coupler, steeringbox area and drag link.
Go for the steering coupler first if it goes you lose steering (very bad)
You an have a friend move the steering wheel back and forth while you
examine all the steering parts below for any play that doesnt transmit to
the wheels.
If your not sure get help.
