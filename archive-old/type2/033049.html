Greets -

I had a problem with my original tranny quite similar to yours, except mine
actually locked up the rear wheels in reverse with the clutch pushed in.
Still a mystery as to what -actually- caused it, but the bottom line was I
had to get a new tranny.

A couple of thoughts/questions:

You mention -40 degree whether. As opposed to what? It could be that
something inside heated up where the outside didn't, and a marginal
component stressed and failed.

Also, in '71, I believe that the tranny included that shaft sleeve (held on
by three bolts) in the bell housing, which needs a compatible clutch
assembly to work properly.

What to do is lift the rear-end, have someone rotate the rear tires backward
and, er, frontward (?), and find exactly where the clack comes from. In my
case, it was in front of the tranny CV joint by about 3-4 inches on the
driver side. That is not a good place, as I found.

Good luck -
