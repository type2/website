CITY UPDATE:  I got another notice from the city last week and this one
was a formal &quot;move the bus in 10 days or we will and destroy it and
charge you...  oh by the way, you can request a formal hearing&quot;.  I
called the lady at the city and she was reasonable, but apparently the
person who filed the original complaint called back and wondered why the
bus was still there.  I explained that my tranny was about to be shipped
&gt;from Washington (Todd Hill sent it Wednesday) and the engine was on the
stand just waiting for the tranny.  I requested a formal hearing and she
said that it would take a week or two to get a date.  I told her if she
pushed it out to two weeks, I should be able to drive the truck to the
meeting.  She agreed noting that its unusual for some one to ask the
city to go slow.  So if UPS comes through next week, I'll be feverishly
installing it and the engine and making the double cab road worthy by
the end of the month.

I told my neighbor that I'm considering getting a couple of butt-ugly
beater busses, making sure they can run, license and insure them and
then drive them every third day just to piss off the whiner that is
complaining about my truck.

-----------

sounds like a solid plan to me - I hate people who bitch and moan about
things that truly are not having an affect on their life - the truck
isn't causing the whiner physical harm - it isn't damaging the whiners
property - it just seems that the whiner has nothing better to do with
their time than to worry about what everyone else is or isn't doing - I
hate people like that - they bring to mind the people who think they
know what is best for everyone else - 

I would also like to second bill and jaynce - go to the source, then the
list
