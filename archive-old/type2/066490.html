So this got me to wondering, if one had a way to anchor down the propane 
bottle, could you use a propane heater with the infra-red elements?  Granted, 
it is sort of an &quot;open&quot; flame but I would think if a person anchored it real 
well, that it would be an excellent source of heat.  And all you'd have to do 
is make sure you had enough rust holes for fresh air. :-)

I used this method last winter when it got really cold, and when I was camping 
in the snow. I secured it with sturdy ropes between the front seats. I could 
face the flame forward when driving, and backward when camping.I also had a 
fan positioned above the flame (secured from the roof) to blow the warm air 
where I wanted it. It worked quite well, but my fiance would not get in the 
car when it was running :-} I guess I can't blame her as the hissing sound of 
the flame is a bit disconcerting. I was also a bit worried about what would 
happen if I rolled the car. In the end I took it out and just wore more 
clothes. The other problem with it was that it produced a lot of condensation 
inside the van which kind of defeats its purpose. 

I think that next winter I may use it again, but only for camping in the snow. 
I have (needless to say) been following the thread on CO meters with 
interest!!
