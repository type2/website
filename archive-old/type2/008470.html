&gt; Hello all  I've been looking for new tires for Bullwinkle (my '76
&gt; Westy) and found that the local Costco can special order 185R14
Michelin
&gt; XC4S tires _at_ ~$77 each.  These tires are LT load C / 6 ply (rated _at_
&gt; ~3200 lb axle) and look like they would be perfect.  Has anyone used
&gt; these tires on their bus, and how'd they work?  Any comments would be
&gt; appreciated.

Well, they're the right size and load rating so they should do fine. 
The only bad press that Michelins have gotten here are that they tend
to separate their steel belts which can really mess up the fender
wells.  If you get a new vibration, be sure to check your tires for
partial separations (with all tires, not just Michelin!)

BTW, were these tires rated M+S?
