Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA (fwd)

5 atdc is for a stock  advance / retard dizzy.
7.5 btdc is right for the dual adv for starters but you should time it
with a strobe and check idle and max advance.

i would make sure that you have the #1 plug firing on the power stroke /
tdc for #1. both valves on #1 closed _at_ tdc and rotor should be pointing to
that plug wire on the cap.
also make sure the plug wires are the right way around the cap. 1432
clockwise. if you have them backward ie 1234 clockwise, you will fire on 2
cylinders.

good luck.
