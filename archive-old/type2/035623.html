Subject: Re: cold tranny prob

I get this here in the frozen tundra of WI too...
gear oil is super thick...and even in neutral the motor is still turning some
of the guts inside the trans...
dunno why it rocks forward...mine does it a *slight* bit as well...
I only have this in the cold too.... its just because the oil is so
thick...especially when its cold.  My RPM's will drop when I let off of the
clutch by about 200 RPM's or so...
