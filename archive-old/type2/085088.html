Subject: Fuel leak fixed in my 70 westy and ??

I drove to work earlier this week and there was a big pool of gasoline under 
my red westy.
I had replace the fuel lines in the engine compartment so this was elsewhere.
I did buy a siphon gadget for $5.00 that saved me from that lovely petrol 
task that I remember do well!
I think it was the metal pipe that goes through the bulkhead/firewall. There 
was no grommet.
I replaced it with an aluminium 1/4 inch pipe from OSH and it seems fine.
Clara suggested that I take a piece of flexible hose, cut a slot lengthwise 
and use that to stop the metal wearing at the bulkhead.
The PICS are on my site, but how many of you upright type 2's have the 
grommet on the fuel line?
I used aluminium pipe that will wear and of what is the correct gas pipe made?
