Subject: replacing nuts 

Hello,
Most of you remember I am in the middle of a engine overhaul.
So I was thinking I should replace the old rusty nuts that hold
the cylinder heads on the studs.
I dont know if nuts are prone to breaking when there old or not
but I figured I might as well do it instead of having to do it later.
So my question is what nuts should I buy? I know there is a lot of
different kinds....hardened steel, galvanized.
What would work good on the aluminum heads and steel studs(right?)?

thanks
Alex, 77 Rivera ..resting in garage soon to be on road hopefully
