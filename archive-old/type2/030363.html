Volks,

I tried my hand at a little computer programming today.  In the one step
forward column, new subscribers are now getting the charter when they
subscribe. In the two steps back column, I apparently made posting
impossible :-)  I took that &quot;feature&quot; out, but a couple of posts got
caught before I figured out what was happening.  Please respond to George
on this one, not me :-)

Re: Clutch Bleeding

In response to the reply which stated you can't use gravity .... perhaps
I have just been lucky but I have always been able to use gravity and a
little &quot;pumping up&quot; using the master cyl. to bleed my clutch system.
Even after completely draining the system.  Perhaps it helps to have the
front up on ramps, it seems that I have always done that just to help
gain better access to the slave cyl.  Should I expect this not to work
someday?
