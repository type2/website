Subject: Re: [T2] Motor changes for the bus

&gt; Well I've got to say that yes the buses have &quot;fragile&quot; handling at
&gt; highway  speeds and if you add a bunch of power and speed you ought to
&gt; consider some  better brakes, sway bars and 15&quot; tires with a better load
&gt; rating.

I wonder how much of the 911 rear suspension could be adapted for the bus?
Except for the width, if you could basically cut the entire rear-end of
the 911 out and weld it to the back of the bus frame... Seriously, though,
if you can use the entire hub, axle, rear brakes, etc., out of the 911,
you would at least have the rear-end beefed up and maybe save on some of
the custom parts you'd have to make. The front end is another matter. You
would want to borrow as much of the front-end of the 911 as possible too.

I don't think weight is too much of an issue if you strip the bus down
some (no camper interior - or at least - no 70's westfalia). My '86 911
was just over 3400lbs - whereas my '74 Campmobile is just under 5000lbs.
I'm sure I could take 500lbs out by removing the west cabinets.

Of course, most of the 3400lbs of the 911 was the engine and suspension -
the parts you want to borrow. In the bus, the engine and suspension
probably doesn't total 1000lbs plus your center of gravity is a few feet
higher...

What might actually be more practical would be to take an 911 chassis,
strip the body off, and build a bus body over top. It would be a little
short - unless you extended the chassis - which isn't any harder in a 911
that it is in a bus (a few longer wires and an extended shift linkage).

That way you wouldn't have to deal with fabbing oil lines for the oil
cooler, keep the 22 gallon fuel tank, etc.

The 1.8l in my bus, when nicely warmed up, will cruise at 75mph. But the
handling sucks. My 911 handled tight as a drum over 130mph. The biggest
lesson I learned driving the 911 is that it wasn't the power of the engine
that made it a high-performance vehicle, it was the quality of the
suspension (and brakes). Sure, a new Nissan Maxima has more hp that my 911
did, but it's a kite when you get over 100mph...
