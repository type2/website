Subject: re: bus vs. jetta

Thanks to everyone who responded to my question about using the bus as a 
primary car and whether I should keep my Jetta as a backup.  All of your 
input on both sides was really helpful.

Having thought things over, I've decided to sell the Jetta and invest 
some of the money in parts for the bus.  My mom is mailing me the title 
this week, and I'm going to start checking the papers for an idea of an 
asking price.  

Having made my decision, I spent much of yesterday afternoon dealing with 
insurance companies and the NYS dept. of motor vehicles.  Got a much 
cheaper price ($450/6 mos) than I expected, and the next time I renew it 
will go down a lot because *all* of the &quot;unpleasantness&quot; (points) in my 
driving record will be gone by then.  At any rate, Spike now bears NY 
plate #L814EK instead of NH plate #961228 which I had &quot;borrowed&quot; from the 
Jetta.  Registration &amp; title (I wanted a title) cost $130.00 for two 
years.  I've got my registration, my insurance card, and my temporary NYS 
license.  I guess this makes me (and Spike) official New Yorkers.  Hey, 
it's not NH, but at least they didn't vote for Pat Buchannan...

Well, I've rambled enough.  I think I'll go back to pretending to get 
something productive done (it's friday, after all) and waiting for 
busboys to get back to me on exhaust part prices...

(anyone wanna buy a Jetta?)
