Subject: [T2] 69 Fuse box

I've got a non-U.S. 69 Westy, and the available schematics in the Library
don't match -- they jump from 67 (8 fuses) to 70 Model Year (12 fuses).
I've got 10 fuses in my fuse box, and my Bentley's is in the shop with my
73. Can someone tell me which fuse goes to what in the 69? I tried to
extrapolate from the available schematics, but that didn't pan out beyond
&quot;the big red wire is hooked up to the far right fuse.&quot;

As I'm trying to troubleshoot my lights (no brake, backup, only left turn
signal/emergency flasher, one hi-beam out), I thought I'd test at the
bulbholder with my multimeter. Which setting do I use and what do I look
for? I tried DC voltage and continuity, and neither one gives me valid
readings.
