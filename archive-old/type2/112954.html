&gt;I have never seen one..... except on split buses. The drawing in my 68-71 parts book is different than the one
&gt;pictured on the website and etka. The one on the website appear to have rolled ends to go around the legs. The
&gt;parts book shows it appearing to have two top hooks and one bottom hook to snap into place.

It seems as though this item is like a clock for the instrument cluster 
or maybe rarer.  If you have one than your lucky if you don't than 
you'll be luckier if you ever do.  If anybody can think of a place that 
has these new or used it would be nice.
