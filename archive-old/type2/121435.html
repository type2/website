Subject: 71 Westy for sale

I selling my 71 Westy. It is my daily driver, the engine was rebuilt (Have 
records) about 2000 miles ago, it has very little rust (some pin  holes on rear 
hatch, sliding door). the interior is in great shape, it has the sink, bench, 
jump seat, hanging closet, rear shelf, new linoleum, childrens cot. The rubber 
on all windows has been replaced. It needs tires BAD. I'm located in Fort 
Belvoir VA. Asking price is 3000 and believe me it is worth it. I'm selling 
because I just purchased a Eurovan. Any takers?

Vic
