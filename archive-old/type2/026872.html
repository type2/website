Hello listmembers~

I am working with a friend whom has a stuck bus in another state, on 
figuring out what might be wrong with it.

She drove it all the way from CA to MN with no problems. Parked it, and two 
days later when she tried to get going, it started right up!
Sounds good so far, but she can't get it to move at all. One of the front 
wheels is completely locked into place, no turning it at all.

What would be the first thing to do to try and free the wheel, or check to 
see about what might need replacing/repairing?

Thanks for any tips to get going in the right direction.
She has someone that is technically inclined, but is not familiar
with VeeDubs enough to guess where to start on this thing.

PS. I took Jasper for her first big trip.
We went from SF, CA, to Bend with 6 people driving straight
only stopping for gas. Never used a drop of oil, and didn't hesitate once.
When we got into Bend, it did make this wierd clicking sound when in gear 
with only 1 or 2 people, but stopped by the time we got back. It seemed to 
be coming from under the exact center of the bus.
anyway, it went well, and Jasper ran great!
