Subject: Re: [T2] [type2] How much Vinyl for back of 72 westy?

&gt; My question: How many yards (approx 5' wide) of vinyl
&gt; fabric do I need to re-cover the back of a 72 Westy?
&gt; (there is the rear facing seat as in late 60's
&gt; Westies).  If any one has an approx. answer that's
&gt; fine.

I &quot;think&quot; 11 or 12 yards depending how well you lay out the cuts.
Ive done it twice and this is off the top of the noggin.
