Some of us are getting together the weekend of December 11-13th for a VW
campout.  We are going to camp at Sequoyah Campground in Valleyhead, AL.  The
park is located about an hour and 1/2 from Birmingham, about 35 miles south of
Chattanooga, TN off of Interstate 59.  They have full hookups, about 85 sites,
caverns to tour and wild animals such as buffalo and deer.  Here is the web
site if you'd like more information.

Sequoyah Caverns &amp; Campg...&lt;/A&gt;  The ranger will give us a discount if we have
over 10 campers and he doesn't care if we double up.  If you need directions
you can call the campground at 256-635-0024.  If you are planning on
attending, please drop me an email line and I'll call the park a day or so in
advance and let them know how many we've got coming so everyone can have a
spot.  

Hope to see you there.
