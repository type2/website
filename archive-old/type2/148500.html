Subject: Re: [T2] hot air tube under the bus

Type B gas vent material (double wall vent connector, galvanized exterior,
aluminum inner  liner, used for furnaces, water heaters etc.) might be
useful for the main warm air duct. It is a rigid duct, but there is a
flexible variety. It is a double wall material, not insulated, but holds the
heat from natural gas combustion pretty well. Enough so you can touch the
outside with your hand when the interior temps are 300 to 350 degrees F.

It comes in a variety of diameters and lengths from 3&quot; on up. There is also
a flexible gas vent material used for lining masonry chimneys that could be
useful for warm air ducting. It's sturdy stuff.

Look for manufacturers, Hart Cooley, Amerivent, Simpson, Metalvent.
