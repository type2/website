Subject: fuel line tee for gas heater

 &gt;I have a '76 FI westy and was wondering the best way to route
&gt;the fuel line to the gas heater. I assumed it would not be
&gt;wise to &quot;T&quot; into the FI ring since it is pressurized at
&gt;30 or so psi so I &quot;T'd&quot; into the line coming out of the tank
&gt;before the FI fuel pump, but when I tried to run the heater
&gt;it acted as though it wasn't recieving fuel.

At the factory the fuel line was tee'd between the fuel filter and the fuel pump.  This is the 10mm fuel line that is hard to locate.
