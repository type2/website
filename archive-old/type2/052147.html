&gt; &gt; Many years ago, I went to the VW dealer to inquire about parts.  I was

&gt; &gt; It seems a shame that the very automobiles that gave VW their start in the
&gt; &gt; car market are now considered outdated by the dealerships.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually I think that is a professional and fair statement. After all they
&gt; are there to sell and service modern cars. I'd rather they tell me openly
&gt; they can't do that sort of thing anymore than that they try and screw up.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember - we are the funny lot -

That we are, and the cars are a bit funny, too.  These days, cars are
designed so that there is only one way for parts to be installed, the
correct way.  Electrical connectors are all different shapes, mechanical
joints are asymmetrical, etc. so mechanics cannot make errors when
reassembling whatever they take apart.

Our old aircoolers aren't quite as easy.  The engineers made the design
as simple as possible, which often meant symmetry.  Many parts can be put
together &quot;wrong&quot;.  For example, when installing the fan shroud, does the
shroud go on the inside or the outside of the cylinder tin?  It goes
inside, and that's the only way it fits right, but it can be put together
wrong, jamming the cooling flaps!  Our  aircoolers are simple, but require
knowledge to fix properly.  Modern cars are more a matter of swapping
modules that fit only one way.

Many mechanics at the dealerships were not yet born when the last
aircoolers went out the door.  It's a bit foolhardy to expect them to be
able to work on aircoolers even when provided with manuals and parts.  We
hobbyists have the time to fiddle around and get things right, but the
dealer mechanic is bound by the tyranny of the flat rate book, and doesn't
have the time to figure out how to get things right.

One of the DDB VW ads showed a mechanic under a bug and had the caption
&quot;Are you paying someone to learn how to work on your VW?&quot;, referring to
those who didn't take their VWs to the dealer.

The irony is, of course, that now if you take your aircooler to the
dealer, they are the ones you are &quot;paying to learn how to work on your
VW!&quot;  This also applies to the newish parts guys who wouldn't recognize an
aircooled thermostat if it bit them!
