Subject: FS: Splittie 2/3 Middle Seat

Splittie nuts,

I have a 2/3 middle seat for sale.  It came out of a '67, would be correct
for most of the '60s busses, maybe some of the late '50s(?).  Needs
upholstery.  The arm rest is in great shape.  Still has the &quot;Jesus bar&quot; on
the back.  The only bad point is one leg has some rust.  It is not
rusted-away-gone kind of rust.  It is structurally sound and will be safe for
for quite a while.  It has been real handy to have an extra place to sit down
in the garage but I know someone out there could put the seat to better
use...besides I just bought a nice yellow Westfalia stool I can use in the
garage.  Anway, $150, trades considered.  (Anybody got a full length roof
rack?)  Located just outside of Kansas City.
