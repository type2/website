Subject: Re: [T2] starter question

&gt;             I'm looking for a starter celluloid for a type 2  the markings
&gt; are as the look like on the part (see below) sorry bout the description on
&gt; the symbol at the top  really don't know how to describe it dose any one
&gt; know where to find these? been have problems finding a new one around here
&gt; would like to find a new one if possible so I can keep my single cab on the
&gt; road  had several fail buying them from junk yards

I assume you mean &quot;solenoid&quot;
Better plan. Just replace the whole starter and dont forget to replace
(and grease the new) bushing.
