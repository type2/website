Subject: ID'ing campers, accessories &amp; seats

I'm brand-new to the list, but subscribe to the Karmann-Ghia list ('71
coupe), and my first car was a '72 Bug that Dad bought off the showroom
floor in Stuttgart, so I'm not a *complete* air-cooled VW newbie...

Well, the other day, the wife and I bought a '71 camper, and I have a few
questions...

First of all, how to tell what type it is?  It's a pop-top, the top goes
straight up, not pitched like a Westy or rolled like a Dormobile.  I
figure it's either a Sportmobile or a Riviera, and would like to know how
to determine which. 

Second, will seats from subsequent years fit into the '71?  The driver's
seat springs are broken, so it's not going to be particularly comfortable
on long trips, and moreover, I'd like to get seats with headrests for
safety reasons.  What year saw the introduction of high-backed seats?  

Finally, are there any good sources for used interior accessories in the
Pacific Northwest or British Columbia?  The sink had been removed by a PO,
and we'd like to get a replacement and, possibly, a small fridge.
