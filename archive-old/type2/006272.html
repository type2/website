&gt; well after yesterday's backfire explosion my engine has been inoperable.
&gt; the battery is nice and strong, the starter cranks great, i have spark at

Sometimes when my '77 backfires(?) it blows the hose off the crankcase
ventilation connection which screws up the vacuum enough to prevent the
engine from starting.  That's right above the cooling air intake fan.
Another one of those connections that comes pops off is the brake vacuum
hose from the left side of the air distribution box(?).  There is some
reason none of these things have clamps like to prevent damage to the AFM or
something.  Just something to check...

Good luck,
Christopher Darilek
