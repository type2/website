This picture is for would be rebuilders of all VW engines.

This was a simple error in snapping the case halfs together.
The phone may have rang, the installer may have stepped away for a drink
of water, whatever.
The results are the same, the bearing was deformed and lost oil pressure
causing burned out bearings, ruined crankshaft, ruined case, ruined the
heads and worst of all an engine fire that destroyed the Vehicle.
The number 3 bearing and oil slinger at the fan were welded to the crank
shaft.
This is one of the few engines I've seen that I just hauled to the
dumpster so I wouldn't ever be tempter to use any of the parts. The fire
caused the heads to have slight melting and the case showed slight
deforming in the oil galleries across the back of the engine, the oil
cooler was melted as was the engine fan shroud and cooling fan. All of
this heat was enraged but firemen hosing down the burning magnesium fan
shroud before they identified the enhanced fuel source.
It is mandatory that you have an oil pressure gauge after a rebuild to
avoid this scenario. The low oil pressure would have set off your alerts
and saved this Vehicle.
I can't speculate about the rebuilders but he did install all quality
parts and this was the only known fault I discovered.
