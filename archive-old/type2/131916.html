Subject: Re: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

I have never seen it (kits), but why on earth would you do this?  You will
roast in your bus without those ventwings.............ever driven in a newer
car with no a/c and no ventwings?  Nothing to direct the air into the car,
and thus you roast...........

There are folks around here that i know that did this to their beetles, and
they cannot bear it to drive them in the summer.  They never realized how
much air those windows put into the car.

Comfort over &quot;cool&quot; anyday for me...But how cool is it to make your vintage
car have no vent wings and thus look like ever other newer car on the road?
