just want to pour gasoline all over the thing and watch it burn.

Nice web site, Don......Your post sounds pretty much what we all have felt 
about our 30+ year old vehicles. It took 30 years for the problems to 
develop, and it may take 3 or 4 years to work through the reconstruction 
phase. And at least $5k or more.

About dumping gasoline on your bus and torching it......Actually it isn't 
up to owners to decide when their buses burn up. Buses that are ready to 
end their existence are programmed at the factory to commit suicide. They 
open up a fuel line and dribble a little gasoline on a hot exhaust and then 
they go out in a blaze of glory....something like the Vikings going to 
Valhalla in a burning funeral boat. We are still trying to find the way 
that this program has been built in by the manufacturer. Someone will 
figure it out, eventually.

So relax and let your bus make some of the tougher decisions. Walk away 
from your frustration and go out and sit in (or under) your bus and have a 
long conversation with it. Quietly ask if there are any special things that 
you bus feels need to be done....like new latches on the cabinets, or maybe 
new wiper blades. Or some new electrical connections. Sometimes it is the 
little gestures of affection that an owner makes, which cheer up an aging 
bus and brings back it's enthusiasm for life and service.

Listen to your bus, Don. It could tell you how to heal the old wounds 
inflicted by former owners, neglect, and time.

1976 Westy..... been working on it since new, one year at a time. My bus 
and I recently been having monthly sessions where I just lie under it on a 
plywood sheet and examine things with a flashlight, looking for messages 
and signs that will direct me to healing activities.
