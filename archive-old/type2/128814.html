Subject: Re: [T2] gas mileage

Hi Dave,

Driving slower will greatly improve your highway milage in a bus. The 
BEST fuel consumption rates I have seen in the westfakia have always 
come from runs made below 60MPH. Driving faster than 65 will increase 
the gas consumption by about the same rate as the speed increase.

I have seen better than 24MPG on the westfakia a few times, but not 
often. That's with both a 1.8L dual carb and 2L dual carb'd engine. On 
the trip to EveryBus I scored above 24MPG twice, but averaged 19.8MPG 
overall. The last two tanks of fuel in that trip involved a couple of 
substantial hills and more than an hour driving straight into a 
3rd-gear headwind.

A proper test of milage should include a return trip in order to factor 
out a difference in elevation and wind direction that may affect fuel 
consumption.

And yes, the EPA estimates in those days were at least 10% optimism. 
The more things change, the more they stay the same!

Happy trails,

&gt; After making the trip to Oklahoma city and back last weekend(522 miles
&gt; roundtrip) I got 17.54mpg on a bone stock avp rebuild with 1,000 miles 
&gt; on
&gt; it.  i used 87 octane.  It is timed to bus specs and I had just put it
&gt; back on points instead of the &quot;weird&quot; 42.7 degree dwell pertronix.
&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; I looked at my copy of the original sticker when I got home and in 1978
&gt; the sticker said 25mpg hiway.
&gt; So, wasn't 1978 still 55mph limit?  Would my bus have done that much
&gt; better at 55mph...from 17.54 to 25mpg?
