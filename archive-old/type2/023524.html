I feel a story coming on........
A buddy had a super beetle..same symptoms as your van...couldn't find the
drain....drove up one day and we looked..nothing....fine..spent a nice evening
and he stayed over..during the night we got a light dusting of snow....the bug
turned in to a snow sculpture...all pretty and white......all, that is, except
for the back window...clean and clear it was..................I musta laughed
for 20 minutes...a stuck defogger relay.....heated glass 24 hours a
day........
Justa thought

steve......
