Subject: re:Rear wheel problems.

Hi Duke, it's my time to help now!
The 6 side Allens screw are OEM VW, the 12 point Torque screws are part
of a replacement boot kit, so that means that your axles were rebuilt
before!

A standard 6 point Allens hex wrench wiil fit and could get them loose
but you could also stripped them, 6mm 12-point HEX wrench are available
for cheap, even if you remove the bolts with a vise-grip (easy trick on
the Bay but not on the Vanagon) you won't be able to screw them back
properly without the right 12 point socket.

I bought a 6-size torx socket kit for $30 (5,6,7,8,9 and 10mm)
Check my site for more info on rebuilding the rear Axle.

week. (my 7th time!!!)
Cheers, Ben

----------------------------------------------------------
First, the six bolts surrounding the flange on each CV boot are,
according to Bently, supposed to be hex socket bolts.  However, after
cleaning the gunk out of the sockets, we discovered that mine look more
like a 12 point torx socket.  Six point size 40 torx bit fit just fine
but didn't give enough grab to loosen the bolts.  Since I didn't want to

strip the bolts, we stopped right there.  Does anyone know what I need
to get these bolts out?  Should I replace them with the hex socket bolts

for ease of removal/replacement?
