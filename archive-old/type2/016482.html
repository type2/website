Subject: Yosemite Road Trip

Dave Greenland,
Sounds like a great trip. I have  a 73 Westy 2.3 914 engine. I have
never
taken it to Yosemite. Mostly up and down the coast.  SLO to Fort Brag.
What
camp ground did you stay at in the park?  Did you pack in your wood?
Have you taken it over the pass to 395 and Mammoth Mt?  Great Mt biking
there. My brother-in-law just came back  with his 71. He had gravel
trucks passing him on the climb.
Happy motoring
George
