I think this is 18mm interior diameter hose.  I was looking for this
hose and stopped in at the local VW dealer; it's available, but the
price will take your breath away!  I emailed Bus Depot, but never
heard back.  Ended up &quot;Magic Tape&quot;ing my hose back together.

Subject: [T2] large diameter vacuum hose


&gt; I am looking for a source for large diameter vacuum hose. By large I
&gt; mean 3/4 inch / 19 MM interior diameter. This is for a:
&gt;
&gt; 1976 Westy
&gt; 2000 CC, FI
&gt; California smog spec.
&gt;
&gt; The specific part that I need the vacuum hose that runs from the
&gt; deceleration valve to the air intake sensor.
&gt;
&gt; I have checked the various web based VW parts vendors and can not
&gt; find anything. The local FLAPS guy told me that &quot;I don't think
anyone
&gt; ever made vacuum hose that large&quot; as he examined my original hose.
&gt;
&gt; I have about a 2 foot length of 3/4 inch heater hose on there now
and
&gt; it seems to work. I hope it doesn't collapse on me.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks and have a great day
&gt; --
