&gt; Stan,
&gt; 
&gt; There's the problem, your bus requires at least a C load (truck) rating, 

Nope.  A &quot;C&quot; in one size is not the same capacity as a &quot;C&quot; in another
size.  A &quot;C&quot; tire is sufficient in 185R14, but you need a &quot;D&quot; in
195/75R14.

Look for the maximum load rating.  It should be at least 1540 pounds ('71
bus spec).  Max load ratings don't lie.
