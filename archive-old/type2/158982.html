Subject: gas fumes

Hi,
I have a 71 bus with stock 1600dp. The other day, after filling the 
tank, I smelled fairly strong gas fumes in the cabin while driving. 
There is no gas dripping on the ground and I don't see anything that 
looks like a leak around the gas lines, fuel pump, or carb. I drive it 
regularly a few times a week. So, I am preparing to pull the engine and 
have a look around the fuel tank. I coated the fuel thank with por15 
about 5 years ago so the tank itself should be ok. I got a 2 1/4&quot; fuel 
filler hose from NAPA and will replace that along with the other small 
hoses in the fuel tank compartment. I am just trying to think of 
anything else related to the smell that I should look at while I have 
the engine out. I was wondering if the charcoal filter itself could 
cause this kind of problem. Is it possible for the (35 year old) 
charcoal filter to plug up completely so that gas fumes can't be vented? 
Would this cause fumes in the cabin? Is there any kind of test for the 
charcoal filter (i.e. shaking it, etc)?
As an aside, I think - I'm not at all sure about this - that when I took 
the gas cap off when I got home that I heard a hiss, as if the tank were 
under either pressure or a vacuum.

Thanks much
