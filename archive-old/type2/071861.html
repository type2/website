To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

We had this same problem when we first got our 68 bus. I looked everywhere to 
try to find a new resiv. &amp; tube, and bus boys was our only hope out in CA.  
They were very helpful, and knew exactly what we needed. I would try them.  
their web site:
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/&quot;&gt;Bus Boys&lt;/A&gt;

They resuced us, so I would say to call them first.
