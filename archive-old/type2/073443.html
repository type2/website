&gt;Dual carbs is the better choice, But nothing can touch FI for reliability and

&gt;unsubstantiated.

So, are the valves different for a FI system converted to a single carb, or
is this just the case for an FI system converted to dual carbs? If there
were extensive modifications to the engine to  put this together, then i
probably won't get it. but if it's a matter of replacing the carb with an
FI system, then i'd do it. I've never had an engine with a carburetor on
it, so i know very little about how they work.

i've found out from him that this bus is a westy, and that the rust seems
to be isolated in the area around the sliding door. I'm going to take a
look at it in a couple of weeks when i'm in pittsburgh.

thanks for all the responses!
