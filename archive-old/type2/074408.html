Subject: Engine install assistance please

Today I discovered how much you can forget in a years time. Its been
about a year since I removed the engine from my 75 bus. I took notes as
things came apart but unfortunately the notes are nowhere to be found.:
( Today was going to be the day to install my new engine. The first
problem I ran into wa the bearer bar. Forgot to bolt it to the motor
mounts before installing the exhaust. Found out the hard way that the
bar can be installed by removing the passenger side heat exchanger and
raising the engine about a foot off the ground. Problem solved.
Proceeded to try installing the engine with all the sheet metal on.
Mistake number 2. After 2 tries I gave up because it was too cold and I
was too frustrated to do a good job of it. While cleaning up my tools so
I can find everything next weekend I remembered that when the engine
came out I had to remove the tin from the rear of the engine. This was
the only way to get that last 1/4 inch of clearance to get the lower
engine to trans. studs to clear the holes in the bell housing. Hopefully
this is the key to getting it back in?

Kind of bummed that the engine didn't go smoothly, but I'll try again
next weekend. No Hurry, That's why I call it the Turtlebus. If I remove
the sheet metal from the rear of the engine, should that give me the
clearance I need? Should the engine be kept level with the ground or
does it need to be tilted at all to get it in? Any advice is
appreciated.

Sorry this is kind of long but I needed to blow off a little steam.

Thanks
Tom
