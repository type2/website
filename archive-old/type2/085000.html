&gt;         The complete (almost) rebuild on my 81 Van is slowly marking time

&gt;
&gt;1. Should there not be a hole in my cat. converter? It is located on the
&gt;bottom                     center, resembling a drainhole or testing
&gt;orafice.

Some replacement cat converts have air injection ports which lead to the 
interior of the cat.  If it is this type of hole, you will need to plug, 
weld or crimp it shut.  It could also just be a drainage hole in the head 
sheild in which case it should be left open.  You will have to look closely 
at it and decide which it is.
