 &lt;&lt; we changed the coil to add some power, and plugged up remaing holes from 
 non-existing heat riser tubes. We also added heater boxes back in place of 
my 
 j-tubes in order to buffer the heat from the push rod tubes. &gt;&gt;
 Hi Daniel,
 Running heater boxes is a good idea, but running them without the fresh air 
 tubes to them from the fan shroud will make the pre-1972 engine run about 30 
 F hotter oil temp.  Do yourself a favor and only use paper covered air 
tubing 
 and at leas &gt;&gt;

why do you prefer the paper covered tubes?   I prefer the plastic ones, ever 
since the fan belt snapped in my 61 In Southern Oregon on the way to 
California, on the way to see the Grateful Dead, and it thrashed  the right 
side paper tube.  As I didn't have a spare I squodged that side closed, 
replaced the fan belt, and carried on my merry way.  within not too long this 
icky smell pervaded the bus.  Pulled over, the right side heater box to body 
tube was a bug plastic one that was melting!!!! Pulled that bad boy out ASAP. 
  Yup, think it did run a little hotter.  Got another fresh air tube before 
exiting Oregon.

I like the hose clamps, and also I like the stock style rubber grommet deals 
for the bottom of the fresh air tubes.  Not only do they hold them in place, 
they help seal up that gap around the tube, for better air flow. 

PS   Having a good engine compartment seal really increases the air flow 
through the fan/cooling system of your ACVW.  This also helps with heating in 
the winter.  :)
