&gt;I would like to be able to unthread what's left of the valve,

&gt;lug nuts off where it's parked, with the tools and muscle I have.)

&gt;Anyway, I know the process of getting to the brake cylinder, and
&gt;I might as well take it apart, etc.... but if you suggest something
&gt;for a quick fix, I will try it.  
What year bus?  '71 and later you don't have to take the big nut off.  Is
there air in the line?  I would assume so or you wouldn't be trying to bleed
it.  If that's the case, you've pretty much have to get the old bleeder out
and a new one in.  If you can't get it out with needle nose vice grips, I
don't see any other way besides taking the drum off and the cylinder.  I
suppose there's the trick of arc welding a rod onto the end of the bleeder
and using it for a handle, but I don't know if I would call that &quot;easier&quot;
than taking off the drum.  :-)  When you take off the lug nuts, make sure
you have a wrench that fits good and solid.  Mine were on tight like that
and I rounded them off with a slightly oversize lug wrench and had to grind
off two.  DEFINITELY not easier.  :-)
