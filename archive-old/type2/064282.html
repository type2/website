&gt; let me use his CB, and it was a MAJOR improvement over the hand held. The
&gt; main advantage of a hand held is the portablilty-you can go walk around
&gt; with it-but the range and battery life are so short it's pretty pointless.
&gt; Just my $.02.

I second Eddie's $0.02.  We bought a portable model for our 2 days on the Inuvik run (since 
at this point Eddie still thought his was working fairly well) but nobody could hear us.  
So in Prince George we bought an external antenna to hook up to it.  People could hear us 
quite a bit better and we could hear others if they were close but we were told that we 
were really &quot;scratchy&quot;.  So after leaving the Trekkers we traded in the hand-held one for a 
non-portable model.  We could receive a lot better.  Not too sure about our transmitting 
range yet though.
