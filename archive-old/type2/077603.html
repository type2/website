Subject: My '78 Seats (was seats/Removal)

While we're on the topic of bus seats, I'd like to add my two cents. 
Last fall I had (read paid) someone rebuild and recover the front seats
to my '78 Westy.  I guess I could have done it myself, but I paid for a
top notch job and new quality automotive upholstery.  No, it's not NOS
or OEM fabric.  Any way, all that cost $250.  Quite a pretty penny, but
well worth it.  The kicker is, I had the guy install seat heaters while
he was in there.  What a great that option that is for the cold
Colorado winters.  

As for removing the seats in a '78, there are latches on the tray that
keep the seat from sliding off the track.  The visible on the sides of
the trays, so don't look too hard.  Anyway, hold 'em up, slide the seat
forward like you normally would, and they'll slide right out.

Happy Thursday...
-Alabama Pete in Colorado
