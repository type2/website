&gt; Nope, _you_ got it backwards. The current order (which is indeed that 2.0L
&gt; is better than 1.8L and 1.7L are the most despised...) is the case because
&gt; baywindow owners are more interested in driving buses than in collecting
&gt; them and showing off. The minute bays become valuable, I guarantee you,
&gt; it will turn around if only because there are so few 1.7Ls.

I just wanted to say, here, that I love the 'keep it on the road' attitude
of our Baywindow community.  :)  I love to hear about 20+ year old vans
crossing the continent &amp; camping out; seeing that it's possible keeps
me going.

My van was the family car since it's purchase in '79 (it's a '78), &amp;
when it got 'retired' (&amp; almost junked!!) it was like I was a kid
realizing for the first time that my dad was getting old.  &quot;What do
you mean it can't make it to Atlanta??  We drove it to California!&quot;
That sort of thing.

So my goal is to return it to family car service for the next generation.
I mean, there're still continents it hasn't driven on!!  Can't have that.

Oh, &amp; from a different thread, I also get that 'why are you waving at me?'
look from Eurovan ppl; their loss, I guess.  However, the Vanagon ppl
I've met seem savvy &amp; cool.  Go figure.
