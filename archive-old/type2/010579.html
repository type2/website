Subject: Axle nut removal tool
Message-Id: &lt;199911101428.IAA02759_at_mail1.centuryinter_dot_net&gt;

I just bought an axle nut removal tool from J.C.Whitney. Since I haven't
heard mention of this tool on the List, I thought I would describe it. 

It appears to be a piece of flat forged steel with a dogbone shape to it.
On one of the ends, it is cut out with a hex shape hole to fit the axle
nut. On the other end, it is cut out with a square shape to fit a 1/2&quot;
breaker bar. stamped on the side are the letters EMPI . The tool costs $6 +
s/h and comes in 36 and 46mm versions. 

The intended use is to remove the axle nut. On my bus, it is a 46mm
hexagonal nut torqued down &quot;helluva tight&quot; to over 250 Ft-Lb. You fit this
tool over the axle nut and insert a 1/2&quot; breaker bar.... whilst applying
downward torque with one hand, you are supposed to strike the edge of one
end of the plate-like tool with a large hammer to shock the nut loose. 

I'll let you know how well it works after this weekend. Previously, I bent
a 3/4&quot; breaker bar attempting to remove this nut with a 46mm socket.
...wish me luck!
