If you're referring to the FRS handhelds, they are all compatible.  The
frequencies and PL tones are all standardized.  Since they are around
470MHz, they are technically UHF radios, not VHF, but they function the
same anyway.

Radio Shack actually has a FRS radio made for cars, with an exterior-mount
antenna, but it is kind of overkill!
