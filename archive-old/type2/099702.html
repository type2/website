Subject: engine number confusion

Hey volks,
I received my birth certificate from the wolfsburg museum yesterday for my 
$500 '79 camper and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it still has 
the original engine in it!  I'm confused on one issue, though.   The engine 
code is GE and everything I'm reading in the type II library indicates that 
it's a California model.  However, the emission sticker on the engine lid 
does not indicate that it meets California standards.  There is no 
reference to California anywhere.  The camper was originally imported to 
the port in Jacksonville, Fla and from what I can determine finding scraps 
of paper in it where it was sold one or two times, it spent most of its 
life in the southeast.  Am I missing something here?  just 
wondering.....tia, Greg
