This is the last minute chance if any of you who are comming to the festival 
that want a T-Shirt.  The post office is going to be closed for the long 
weekend of the 4th and I am out of town until the 5th,  so I am extending 
the deadline for orders until Friday June 7th.  I must place the order that 
day to ensure they are ready for the event.  So if you want a shirt, and 
they are gonna be really cool.......print an order form off the HCBF web 
site and drop it in the mail to me.

The very Groovy folks from the Full Moon Bus Club are preparing a breakfast 
feast for us on Saturday Morning.  There will be many mouths to feed and I 
really appreciate the Full Mooners for all there efforts.  if you would like 
to help the cause:  donate: food, cups, plates, utinsels, ect please contact 
the Guru of the Full Moon Club: Snoopy....you can email him at :  
waitejj_at_musc_dot_edu

also check their web site:  www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com

I can't wait for this years festival and I hope to see all of your buses 
there!!
