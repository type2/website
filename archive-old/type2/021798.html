Subject: Re: Power inverter for TV-VCR

In response to running a housepowered tv-vcr on an inverter:
You are better off finding a 9&quot; tv vcr combo that is dual voltage; they
are common and don't eat extra current for the inverter. An extra
battery is helpful also.
  On a minivan trip, because they wated to play videogames on a larger
TV, we sucessfully ran a Phillips 13&quot; tv-vcr in the minivan using just a
300 watt inverter- but only while the engine was running.  It's rated at
65 watts, taking up therefore about half the power of your headlights.
(5.4 amps plus the power the inverter uses?)  Get a voltmeter and hook
it across the battery and watch it while your setup is running without
the engine; when it drops to 11 volts, it's time to run the bus.  How
long that takes depends on the capacity in amp-hours for your battery
and it's age and charging history.  So as not to ruin a standard
battery, I'd run 25% of its capacity; IE, if 80 amp hours,  that's 80
hrs at one amp, or safely, 20 hours. Divide that by the amps you are
using, so 6 goes into it about 3.3 hours.  That's 2 movies, but depends
on health of battery.  You can get devices that automatically kill the
current at that voltage; we use for our fridge a Whistler PP002 model
that is rated at 10 amps 
and cuts out at 11.2 volts; check stores that sell cell-phone car
accessories or RV stores.  The ones from camping world were crap.

&gt; Hey Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to run a 13&quot; color TV/VCR combo while camping. I searched
&gt; ebay and it looks like I need an inverter. Do you have any experience
&gt; with these? If so, would I be able to watch a couple of movies before
&gt; draining a fully charged battery?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
