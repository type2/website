Folks,

Last week I described a clutch problem to the list. Thanks for your many
suggestions. All of you who suggested a decaying clutch cable win an award.
Upon inspection, the clutch cable was a mess. I ordered a new one from RMA.

One friend suggested that I replace the linkage. Since it was only a few
dollars, I ordered that, too. Now, I can't find a reference to the clutch
linkage in the Bentley manual. Does it go by another name? Can anybody point
me to the correct section of the Bentley manual?
