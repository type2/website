Subject: Opinions wanted....

I have a '71 Westy with a stock 1600 DP, balanced, CW crank, CDI, Berg
header, and a stock 34 PIC3 that I have been going crazy trying to dial in.
So far 3 people who make their living working on VW's, and whose opinions I
respect, have recommended getting a progressive 2 barrel carb, saying that I
will get better performance along with better gas mileage. I have always
heard that they are a b-tch to get dialed in right.

I also highly respect the collective judgment of this list. I would really
appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried this set-up, either pro or con.
I am most interested in drivability, fuel economy, and performance. As
always, TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
