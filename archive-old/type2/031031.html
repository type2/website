&gt; Looking for some advice, I've been looking for westy and recently came across 
&gt; a 78 automatic in good shape.  What problems can I expect ? Is the 78 an odd 
&gt; ball year with hard to find parts ?

I have a 78 with automatic, have had it for 7 years, and it has 278k on
it.  there are a few parts that are quirky and a little harder to find but
so far I have found most of em eventually


&gt; Is the automatic going to make it slower, and does anyone have one of these, 
&gt; are there any quirks with them ?  I have a 69 bus and was looking for 
&gt; something with a bigger motor so I can go 65-70mph...
&gt; 
it will go faster than I'm willing to,  easily 65
