Having just read the recent posts on safety &amp; having just had the worst
drive in a bus EVER. I thought I'd share (group hug ;).

As I have posted this week I am fitting a BA6 into my bus, it's coming out
of a friends bus that's for sale. Since he was banned for drink driving
(only 1 beer &amp; 1/2 glass wine!), I had to drive his bus, to my Mechanic, to
remove the heater -I even have the keys to use the equipment at w/ends :)!

We both brought our latest busses &amp; his first in Dec 97' both with a new
MOT. His was a more original bus than mine &amp; appeared to be the better buy.
Soon the brakes were a bit shabby &amp; the steering was vague Although it never
broke down, driving his bus has never been a pleasure for him (or me now!) &amp;
camping has not been easy either.

On the other hand I have had to spend more time &amp; £ on my bus &amp; even now
it's in for a major re-build. He has always wanted a bus MUCH longer than
me, but I have enjoyed the experience more, I couldn't work out why until I
drove his van- WOW,  Now I know! :-

No brakes, well pull the Em brake _ALL_ the way out &amp; they make a nice
grinding noise.

No steering! The wheel can turn 90 degrees before the wheels start to turn.

No Mirrors, LHD with no mirrors, on a RHD 3 lane road = PANIC

Engine stalls EVERY time you stop or use the clutch, which only bites in the
last 1/4&quot; of travel &amp; then is SO violent that I kept hitting my head on the
unit behind.

Realy, this bus is TOTALLY UN-road worthy. I wanted to stop &amp; leave it at
the side of the road, but the BA6 &amp; warm feet beckoned me on for the
journey, only 5 miles, but the most stressful ever. Amazingly this bus has
been like this since it  was sold to him by a Popular VW dealer (ARCHIES in
London - Hope your reading you SH!T) who has sold a death trap &amp; probably
still does. I'm not suprized he never enjoyed his bus. Were now going to
totally re-build the brakes, fit a new steering box (ouch £) &amp; respray the
van, before he can sell it, I hope this experience has not scared him off
Busses &amp; has taught him to be more careful of the sharks that want our
money.

Sorry for the ramble, but a dealers greed has put at risk 2 lives I hold
dear.
