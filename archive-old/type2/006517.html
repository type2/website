Subject: RE: Vacuum hose, hoover bit
Date: Fri, 9 Mar 2001 10:10:52 -0500
X-Orig: &lt;crick_at_americasm01.nt_dot_com&gt;

	Someone was asking about big vacuum hose. If you can't find it, you
can use non-vacuum hose by
	slipping a large long steel spiral spring inside the hose that will
help support it and stop it form collapsing.
	Where would you get such a spring you ask? Beats me! I know I have
some that would work in my
	spring box that I inherited from my dad who collected stuff for most
of his 70 years. Could be the 
	hairspring out of a 38 Buick muffler for all I know?

	What is a Hoover Bit. Come on guys time to come clean here. A
&quot;Hoover Bit&quot; Is a mythical magic tool
	that old VW veterans use to mystify, and fool newbies to the VW
world. If some Newb  has a problem, and asks
	more than one OldVolks type guy how to fix it, they pretend to think
and then one of them will say. 
	&quot;Best way to do that is to use a Hoover Bit. The other nods sagely,
and says &quot;Yup!&quot;. The Newbie then 
	makes a fool of himself running around asking people where he can
get a Hoover Bit.
	Its a bit like sending someone to get 100 feet of shore line, or a
sky hook. I think most 
	industries, and subject matter areas have similar jokes they pull on
the new guy.


	Sorry for letting the secret out. The Devil made me do it.
	Besides it is Friday
