Subject: Re: wave to buses

Whenever someone waves at me and they are not driving a bus I smile real big 
and wave enthusiastically because I just know they wish they were me.  
That's all.

I may have scared someone just last night though.  I was driving through a 
parking lot along a strip mall in Alexandria and saw a green and white 
whale-top bus with Arizona plates. When I realized the owners were in it I 
tried to turn around and go back to chat but they just waved and left.  It 
turned out that we both headed the same way for a couple of miles and I just 
couldn't stop looking at their bus.  So I guess that kind of applies to the 
obsessive behavior discussed in another thread.

Anyway, if that person is on the list and is still around the DC area I 
would love to see inside your beautiful bus.
