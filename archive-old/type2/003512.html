Chris, Scott, and all, it is actually really easy to set up a computer to
run in your bus.  All you have to do is change the power supply for the
computer and arrange for 12v power to the LCD monitor.  I got a 12v power
supply from ICP America www.icpamerica_dot_com model 916V, in my case, but you
will have to figure out your own computer's needs.  Just take out the old
115v supply and put in the new.

I got a surplus LCD display from ebay which was just the guts, sans frame.
IJust the thing for a custom installation.   hooked up the 12v leads and
plugged it in and it lit right up.

There are some  problems.  The 12v power supply does not put out enough amps
to run a lot of cards.  I have two disc drives and a cd rom, a video card
and a high speed serial port, which all run fine, but when I tried to hook
up a TV card and a satelite modem, the circuit breaker shut me down.  I am
considering building a separate computer just to handle those functions.
Sounds like overkill, but used computers are cheap, and a separate system
would not need all the drives and other I/O devices that the primary
computer powers all the time.  Huighes has just released a two way satelite
high speed internet system, which should let you do your internet
communication from anywhere your bus can go.  Very cool stuff.

When not plugged into the bus, the system runs off a $10 12v power supply
from the surplus store or from my small solar electric system.

Regards,

Grant
