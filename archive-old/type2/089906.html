Janice,
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;bounce&quot;, but you will still experience
overspray with the HLVP--there is no such thing as lack of---
The only system that you will get almost totally zero overspray is with
an electrostatic spray set up---where all of the paint is electrically
attracted to the vehicle your refinishing.
And now your talking mucho denaro's--
I paid $3500.00 for the Wagner set up I have--and that was cheap.
But even then it doesn't lay the paint down  as nice as a suction gun---

And neither will the gravity feed gun.

Go to NorthernTool_dot_com, and buy yourself a $19.00 suction feed Binks
look alike, paint all the vehicles you have to paint, and throw the gun
in the garbage---this is the most economic, cost efficient way to do
this job for the inexperienced hobbyist--

Staple some viscuine on the walls, put the blower out the window, and
hose down the floor good, and go for it--- 

 
E-mail message From Janice=A0Bartmess 

I guess that the main thing that appealed to me about the HVLP systems,
from the information on that first page, is the lack of &quot;bounce&quot; and
overspray, dust and paint waste. I have a very limited area in which to
paint.. basically a two car garage with plastic drop sheets to help
reduce overspray. I could hook up a ventilation system of sorts. I have
a pretty high volume air exhaust fan and I could get some ducting pretty
cheap. Right now, I have six vehicles that would all greatly benefit
from a paint job. I could take them to a painting shop.. we have a One
Day nearby. That's what I was going to do originally. But all of these
except one, a bug, are vans or bigger. Those don't get the bargain
rates. $$$ So, I thought maybe that this is something worth getting
into. Even if I broke even on the cost of the system and paint, if I
owned the system when I was done, that would be cool. Well, I am not an
experienced painter, and that is sure going to make a difference in the
results I get. I do have a standard spray gun that I bought from a local
auto-paint auto-body store.. we have a few of those around, too. We also
have a nice portable compressor. So, I could go with that, but I got the
impression that a novice could get a better result with less mess from
an HVLP system. 
Any more thoughts? TIA.. Jan B
