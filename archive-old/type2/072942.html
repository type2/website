Got the seal on the other (one-piece) window that's going in the left rear
side! Woo-hoo! Now I need to treat the rust on that window frame before I
can install the window.

Another note: Starting tomorrow (Sunday 8/27), Target has on sale the
uber-chair -- a fold-up camping chair with arm slings, bev holder, and foot
rest. $16.95 or something like that. That's about half as much as I saw
them priced a year ago. I'm THERE! :-)
