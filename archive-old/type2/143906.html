&gt; Its been like 8 yrs for me. When I do it (which I will before the bus is
&gt; on the road again) do I need to do anything special to dispose of the fluid.

I take the stuff to the same FLAPS that I take my oil to.  They put it all
in the same tank.  This is logical, since over 90% of &quot;recycled&quot; oil is
actually burned as fuel.  Brake fluid is a type of alcohol, so it should
burn just fine!
