&gt; Still, Bus Depot has been great for the things I've bought from them, just
&gt; wish they checked their eMail more often.


I think it's more of an issue being overwhelmed with emails. Talking to
Chris at Busted Bus, he mentioned just how large the mountain of email
really is. And I think BD has a larger footprint in the market than BB does.
Which means exponentially more email.
