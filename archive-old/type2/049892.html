Subject: Re: [T2] bus toy sighting/part needed

.  It was a
&gt; bus that was drag raced out.  Lowered, painted, even had a spoiler.  I
don't
&gt; know if it was cast or plastic but it was about 10&quot; long and fairly heavy.

That was a hot wheels collector edition .  I have one, It goes for around
$20, and is quite cool!!
