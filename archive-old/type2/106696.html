Subject: Re: [T2] Upper Starter Bolt 

I have removed/replaced my starter at least 7 times, so I would like to 
offer another idea:

After I get the bolt/nut off, I clean the bolt's threads (also the nut's 
threads, of course) so that the nut can spin on the bolt with my fingers.



My problem was that I could not get the nut started on the bolt without 
pushing the bolt furthur &lt;-  my spelling choice  ;-)  back , and losing the 
'D' lock feature.

So, with the bolt in place, I go into the engine compartment and I loop a 
thin sewing thread around the threads of the bolt which are closest exposed 
to the 'firewall'.

I hold slight pressure on the sewing thread and the bolt will not slip back 
as I secure the nut to the bolt with my fingers.

Once I get a few turns on the bolt with the nut, I can let the thread loose 
(it was NOT knot'd on the bolt, just looped around the bolt's thread.)

Then I can pull the nut (to keep the 'D' lock) as I tighten it with my 
fingers.


I don't have a problem removing the nut/bolt since the nut can be turned 
with my fingers once they are broken free.
