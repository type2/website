&gt; &gt; Greetings Volks
&gt; &gt; While it's not up there with world peace, another bus is up and
running again.

&gt; &gt; What the heck, the wifes asleep, lets
&gt; &gt; paint those wheels and backing plates and bake them in the oven.
&gt; Chuck:
&gt; That brought a smile. I thought I was the only one who put the
wheels in
&gt; the oven! Sure makes that paint durable!

I've done the same, but I've been lately pondering the safety of this
practice.  The paint is liberating a lot of very flammable gases and
the combination of these gases and the flames or red-hot heating
elements in a closed oven could lead to disaster.

The last time I wanted to bake paint, I made my own baking booth from
an old metal cabinet.  Punched a hole in the top, hooked up an
electric paint stripping gun.  Punched a similar hole in the bottom to
allow air to escape.  Put the wheels (yes, 2 will fit!) in the box,
plugged in the stripper, and let 'er fly for an hour or so.  Temps are
similar to those you would use in an oven, but the heating elements
only see fresh outside air, not flammable vapors inside the box.

I'm not claiming that this approach is perfectly safe, but at least
the explosion will take place in the middle of my driveway, not in the
kitchen!

Another advantage is that you never have to face the question &quot;what
_is_ that horrible smell?&quot;  :)
