Subject: Its In!!

But have not tried to start it yet. A Couple of questions.

1. There is a hose (vaccum I assume) that goes from the the throttle valve
housing (the nipple it sits on points toward the rear) that I did not label.
Does it go tothe decal valve?

2. On the far left of the firewall is a unit that two square electrical
connecters plug into. There is also two wires coming out of one of the
square connectors that I think connect to the screw mounting the unit to the
firewall. Is this right??   TIA
 
If children are not learning then we should change how we are teaching them.
