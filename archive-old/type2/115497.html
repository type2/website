Subject: Engine for sale

Unfortunately, for a beetle............

1600 DP engine.turn key.meaning all tin, alternator, shroud everything in
place.  Put it in and turn the key.  AH case.  It was a rebuild thru the
local VW dealer, they told me came straight from VW, but no paperwork on it.
I bought it straight from the dealer, for they had it in the back for a few
years, and the customer never came to pay for it.  I uncrated it, and
assembled it.  Runs fine on the bench. Nice and strong.

I already have 3 spare motors, and i need to sell this one, for i am out of
room!

$700 and shipping..........you would have to ship it via truck..I am not
close to a forward air facility.   Motor is sold as is.
