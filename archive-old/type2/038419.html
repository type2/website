Subject: Re: more on distributors...

One other issue that isn't often considered is beyond how much the
advance/retard kicks in....

it's WHEN They kick in!

Careful inspection of the hose, vac pots, and carb fittings will go a long
way to understanding this mechanism.

The vac pot on the distributor are DIFFERENT sizes on advance and retard
sides. In addition, the hose sizes and fitting sizes (in the carb) are
different sizes. The combination of this means that one acts much faster
than the other, resulting in one effect when they are first used, and
another some time later (as the vacuum &quot;catches up&quot;). This was done on
purpose, and is quite clever.

The result is that emmisions are reduced (retarded spark), but steady state
operation maximizes mileage too (advanced spark)
