I'll bet you never thought this was going to be such a PITA.

These guys on the list would much rather argue than answer your question.
Ha! Ha!

&gt; look,
&gt; 
&gt; when i posted this question about solid and hydraulic
&gt; lifter swappage, i had no idea that it would incite
&gt; riots on the list. all i wanted was a few opinions,
&gt; and perhaps some feedback from past experiences.
&gt; however, I (the list) has no need for petty bickering.
&gt; that's not what i had thought this list was all about.
&gt; obviously people are going to have different opinions.
&gt; opinions that have probably been influenced by past
&gt; experiences. the beauty of it is that everyone can
&gt; have an opinion, and express it on this list without
&gt; really hurting anyone. there is no need to get
&gt; offended if someone has an opposing opinion. c'mon, i
&gt; thought we were all pals here! helpling each other
&gt; with our buses, remember?
&gt; 
&gt; i'm leaving my engine solid, thank you to everyone who
&gt; responded to my question. later
