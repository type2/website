&gt; Good grief. If you had not have posted the shot of the bottom I might

&gt; wondered if the seal was inside out.

Yah, I was pretty amazed at the size of the gap, myself.

&gt; Volks, does it matter if the seam of the seal goes at the bottom? You
&gt; wouldn't think so.

Yah, I thought the seal was uniform all the way around...

&gt; The bottom of the windshield rusts from the inside out, not the other 
&gt; way
&gt; around. By the time a tiny bits of rust appears there's a lot of cancer
&gt; under there. Even with no visible sign it's usually pretty bad as you 
&gt; find
&gt; out when you replace the windshield. For example...

Yuck :(

Eek!  How did you repair that?  Fiberglass?

Sigh, perhaps the rust is worse than I thought ... today I was running 
an errand over in Berkeley, and I noticed something &quot;funny&quot; with the 
electricals ... the brake warning light would pulse brightly once if I 
stepped on the gas, and the flasher would &quot;BZZZT&quot; if the signal was on 
when I did that (I noticed this when pulling out of a parking spot onto 
San Pablo), and doing this would also cause the radio to power-cycle.

I guess I must have gotten some water into the instrument cluster/fuse 
panel?  All of the symptoms were gone about 1/2 across the Bay Bridge.  
I only noticed this happening after that hard raid we had yesterday.
