Subject: Re: Exhaust Emissions Help ?

His '82 should have both the catalytic converter and an O2 lamda sensor.

I had responded (just to him, not the list) that he should check the
exhuast system for leaks (this stuff doesn't work on a leaky exhaust),
replace the O2 sensor (fortunately the single-wire type, so a $25 part)
and then think about replacing the cat (more $$$ for it, tho').

Mine failed at idle (last time it was checked several years ago) and might
still, but I found a bad idle stabilizer since...

I also told him that if it passes visual without the EGR stuff, not to bother
for the smog test.  I understood that the EGR reduces peak combustion temps,
and lowers NOx emmissions only.  I don't think they are used anymore, or
really needed with the reformuated gasolines.  

Am I off base on this stuff?
