Subject: Bus is PERFECT, except for...

Guys,
Well, I spent some $$$$ on getting my bus working OK! WHAT a difference...
It takes off at the lights like a scalded cat! New points, condenser, plugs,
oil, air, oil &amp; fuel filters, etc... even a NEW window winder!

I just have one TEENSY problem... it STILL has a flat spot, when the go
button is pushed, nearly dies, THEN it takes off! Most frustrating!
Carbies, perhaps?

Any clues?

GK
BTW, my 75 bus clock arrived today from Scott in NC! Can't wait to install
it! Thanks, Scott&gt;
