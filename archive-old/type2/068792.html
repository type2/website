Subject: Smog II - oops

        Bren,
        Sorry, I mis-read your post.
        I'm not sure about your being 'required' to smog with the engine 
that came with it. How will they know, I ask?  I didn't have to smog my 
truck with the blown-up engine it came with, or explain where the engine 
I brought-in came from. 

        For any smog check, you show up, they inspect the vehicle &amp; engine, 
run the test, you pay. I've never seen a smog check tech check the serial 
number of the case or notice any of the minor non-stock items on the various 
air-cooled's I've brought in. Their little computer screen tells them
to look for a carburetor or FI, evaporative emissions stuff, PCV
valve, air-pump, catalytic converter or whatever. Words, not pictures. 
You or I or Thom would supply pictures, natch, but the state... well...

        If you FI isn't running killer-rich and the catalyst is working,
you're going to have no problem with '79 OR earlier tail-pipe test.
The major headache is how much, if any, of the applicable smog stuff
is on the engine now. They'll look for a charcoal canister, and some
hoses, catalyst, etc. The 'loaf Bentley should list all the parts
for '76 AND '79.

        That said, the as-delivered (in the Netherlands) setup in
your double-cab was probably a 1600dp. You've even got a letter from
VW saying it was built for the Netherlands, not USA. I dunno if you
want to open that can of worms, but it might be interesting to
ask (as long as you've got Consumer Afairs on the phone) whether
you are required to maintain it in as-built-for-Europe condition or
as-it-would-have-been-for-USA-that-model-year condition.

        Good luck, and I'll check the Bentley tonight.

        Bill
