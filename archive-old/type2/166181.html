Subject: Re: [T2] Tech assist in Texas

Hi JT,

I'm a ways from TX, but I'll help by email...

Before messing with FI, you need to start with a known good engine.  
Even if you KNOW it is good, do a tune-up. Check the points, wire,  
coil and plugs. Check the dwell and verify timing and advance. Set  
the valves, and do a compression test. If you skip this step, you are  
wasting time and $$.

Once you have verified that all else is good, you can start with the  
FI. You will need a vacuum gauge, a fuel pressure gauge, a test light  
and/or multi-meter, and the FI manuals from the www.ratwell_dot_com site.  
They contain pretty much all you ever need to know about Bosch L- 
Jetronic FI systems.


Happy Trails,
