Thank you I do remember the shims on the original calipers but I just
checked and they are not on the loaded ones I bought, guess it's time to go
to DA store.

Scott,

Sorry about the blank message.  too fast on the fingers.  There are
antisqueal shims made that fit beween the pad and the piston on disc
brakes that will help with, if not eliminate, this problem.  The brakes
originally came with these, but thru the years they have a high tendency
towards disappearing.  The original aluminum plates are NLA but any FLAPS,
can sell you a stickon replacement.
