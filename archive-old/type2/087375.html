&gt;What am I missing?

I will forgive the pun: :)

My pal Roy had a similar problem that came and went.  We discovered 
to our surprise that a bent dizzy clamp was keeping the dizzy from 
fully seating in the drive gear.. Although I do not really understand 
how this caused an intermittent firing problem on one cylinder, it 
did. The problem promptly disappeared when the dizzy was fully seated.

Thanks
