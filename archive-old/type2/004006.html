I saw (2) two 71 - 79 wiper motor assemblies on ebay today. Both were at
19.95 with no bids! Here are the links:

&gt; &gt; Hi All!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a '71 and the wiper motor runs very slowly. And there isn't much
of a
&gt; &gt; change in speed between low and high. Is this normal or should I be
looking
&gt; &gt; for a new motor or is it possibly something else? I've look around and,
of
&gt; &gt; course, a wiper motor seems to be one of the most expensive single part
you
&gt; &gt; can buy for your bus!! &gt;:-(
&gt;
&gt; I took mine apart and re-distributed the grease.  It had all shifted to
the
&gt; outside of the gear housing.  Greased the shafts and she worked fine.
&gt;
&gt; Good Luck
