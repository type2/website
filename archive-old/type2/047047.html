Subject: [T2] replacment started bush install??? help

A couple of days ago I posted a mail asking for suggestions on how to pull 
out the old starter bushing to install a new one with my replacment starter.
My email failed so I didi not get any replies.
I the mean time I have found an artikle in the library on that .
but what happens if you do not change the bush?


thanks
Lukas
