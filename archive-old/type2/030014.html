On the infamous over-the-weekend-drive to Seattle a few years back (!!) in
Ichigo, we got a shot of the speedo hanging right around the P in
MPH...mind you, of course, when i got the ticket for 69 in a 55, the
needle was at 80...but none the less.

i have NO idea where that picture has gone, unfortunelty...one of many
rolls of film that the time builders have yet to remember.
