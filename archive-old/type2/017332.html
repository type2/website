&gt; ok everyone take a deep breath and release slowly.
&gt;
Always a good idea before you press send on the emailer. More often then not I just
press delete instead, having benefitted just from the chance to get all my thoughts
in order.

&gt; now lets try again
&gt; with how retrofitting parts and enjoying our vehicles to the fullest is
&gt; bad karma.  first off, what????  we dont want to lose sight of the whole
&gt; aura of the type 2.  my bus is ugly 3 shades of brown, big dent in the
&gt; nose bondo is a close friend and someones living room gave up a bit up
&gt; carpet for the inside.  but i love it.
&gt;

Hey Doug, do you know I had to go out and check my driveway just now? For a minute
there I thought you were driving *MY* camper!!!

I love mine too.
