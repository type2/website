Three years ago I blew out a plug in my 73 Superbeetle. I was visiting a
friend in Madison, Wisconsin over the weekend. It happened on a Sunday
afternoon around 4:00 as I was getting set to drive back to Davenport,
Iowa. It happened with a loud bang, followed by my engine sounding like
a jet airplane. Power loss was great but I was able to get it off the
interstate and go back into Madison (2 miles). At a convenience store I
called different shops to find someone to help me out. After calling
around I was recommended to a man who worked out of his home in the
country. Actually he had a huge garage with many VW only tools (I think
he was a former factory-certified air-cooled mechanic) He stayed open
until I got there. It took me 45 minutes to get there, hoping the engine
wouldn't vibrate completely out of commission.
        When I got there he knew exactly what to do. He had a flexible drill
that allowed him to drill the spark plug hole larger while the engine
was still in the beetle. He put a helicoil in and off I went. I only had
$15.00 with me. He charged me around $8.00 so I had enough for gas to
get home. Great guy - very friendly. I wish I remembered what his name
was and where he was located. So if you take it easy you can limp with 3
cylinders ( I went about 10 miles). Just wear your earplugs...
