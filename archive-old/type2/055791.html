Subject: RE: loaf layout idea

&gt;The decal on my sink/icebox says that the rear facing seat is 
&gt;not to be used while the vehicle is in motion.  Can anybody 
&gt;shed some more light on this?  Is it because of no seatbelts 
&gt;or some other reason?  Seems like the passenger would bump 
&gt;his head with the driver's head.

No, it's due to the head-snapping acceleration found in the older loaf
Westys that would tend to throw the poor guy sitting there completely
out of his seat.

Seriously though, if I remember right, isn't the warning sticker in
reference to the removable jumper seat rather than the fixed seat behind
the driver?  And besides, that fixed seat should have a seatbelt for it.
My 73 does.
