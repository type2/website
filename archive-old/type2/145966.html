Subject: Re: [T2] Have you ever floored your motor? (definition of
  motor)

Dictionary_dot_com:

&quot;moB7tor n.

   1. Something, such as a machine or an engine, that produces or imparts
motion.
   2. A device that converts any form of energy into mechanical energy,
especially an internal-combustion engine or an arrangement of coils and
magnets that converts electric current into mechanical power.
   3. A motor vehicle, especially an automobile: bIt was a night of lovers.
All along the highway... motors were parked and dim figures were clasped in
reveryb (Sinclair Lewis).&quot;


Ever heard of the &quot;Motor&quot; series of auto repair manuals? They've been around a
very long time and are well respected in the industry. Your local library
probably has several of them.


&gt;A mantra for the 21st Century...

&gt;MOTORS ARE ELECTRIC.
&gt;ENGINES ARE GASOLINE.

&gt;Electric motor.
&gt;Gasoline engine.

FWIW, I used to believe the same thing.
