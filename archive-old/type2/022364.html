Depends on what you are after.  If you're after maximum acceleration, there is definately a reason to rev past the peak hp rating.  When you upshift, you are lowering (numerically) the overall gear ratio, which means you will need more horsepower to accelerate at the same rate.

When you stay in a lower gear and rev past the hp peak, you will still accelerate faster, up to a point.  At some point beyond peak hp, your horsepower will have dropped off so far that the gear advantage will not offset the horsepower loss when compared to the same speed and lower rpm in the next higher gear.  

Kind of hard to explain but it's simple to compute optimal shift points for acceleration if you have the horsepower curves and gear ratios for your engine and tranny in a spreadsheet.

For optimum fuel economy, you should keep the engine as close to it's torque peak (not hp peak) as possible and drive as slowly as possible.
