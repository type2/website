Subject: Re: [T2] Fire!

the other day I pulled over because smoke was coming out the back of my 82
Westfalia, I shut it down and ran around back to see it was just oil burning
off from the night before when my oil filler tube fell off.  So I got back
in and saw behind me a sheriff parked and walking toward me - I asked what's
the problem?  And he says 'Is it on fire?!' with an extinguisher in his
hand.  I said no it's just oil burning off.  I feel safe from engine fires
with this sort of protection..
