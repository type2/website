&gt; &gt; I have a 1979 2.0 litre motor in the 1972 bus and it does not have a

&gt; &gt; anyone has a stock one sitting around let me know.
&gt; I have never heard of a cheap plastic aftermarket timing scale. The genuine
&gt; Volkswagen ones are cheap plastic, though, so perhaps that's what you're
&gt; thinking of.

????? I have one of the plastic ones on mine now but when I got it there
was a metal one there it was white with black tic marks and a red dot at
the timing point...unfortunately the coating wore off and it is pretty
much unusable now but I still have it..what was this on originally
