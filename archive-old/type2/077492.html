Subject: Re: [T2] cloth seat covers?

[...]

You have the Champagne Edition.
You should also have chrome bumpers, brown steering wheel, brown shift knob,
brown rearview mirror. 2 tone paint.

&gt; To my knowledge, this bus has never been touched that way&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt; 132,000 original miles and the engine appears to have never been out of it
&gt; yet.
&gt;
&gt; The seat covers on *all* the seats are a &quot;red&quot; vinyl with what appears to
&gt; be off white looking cloth inserts.  The panel trim is the same
&gt; &quot;red&quot; vinyl with what appears to be &quot;chrome&quot; lines embeded in it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The front window cranks and the dash are a very dark brown.
&gt;
&gt; The outside colors are a dark red? over brown with graphic stripes(3) down
&gt; each side.
&gt;
&gt; It is not a camper.  It has a walkthru between the front seats and a
&gt; middle and back seat.  No sun roof.
&gt;
&gt; It was manufactured in March of 1978, the vin number starts out as 2282.
&gt;
&gt; What is it?
