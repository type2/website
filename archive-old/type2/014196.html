Subject: whomp whomp...

Well, I took the bus back to the place where I had the
tires mounted.  It appeared that the driver's side
front tire had lost its weight.  Well, they put the
new weight on the inside of the wheel.  All of the
others are on the outside.  That seemed a bit odd to
me.

The main reason I took it in, was due to the whomp
whomp I get under the floor on the driver's side.  I
assumed it was a tire balance problem.

So here's the run down: I have new bearings, tie
rods/ends, draglink, balljoints, sway bar rubber
mounts, new tires, new shocks and a front end
alignment.  The sound occurs at 35 mph and &quot;goes away&quot;
when faster.  The speedometer moves with the sound
(flickering with the oscilation I guess.)

What else could it be?

Thanks everyone!
