Subject: exterior lenses

73 Westy
2 dumb questions:
 
1) the front side lenses are just mock lights? no actual light bulb? Or did my PO do something weird?  Do I have different doors from a different year?
2)What is a good lubricant for the rubber/foam lens seals to aid cracking?
 
thanks all!  Happy Halloween eve.....
