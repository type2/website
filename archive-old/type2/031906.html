&gt; This 2.0 case should be true, but I will have it checked, and align-bored,

&gt; and far between. Thoughts?

I took two 2.0 cases into AVP (Sacramento, CA) a couple of weeks ago.  I 
wasn't planning to have anything done to them, I took them with me &quot;just 
in case.&quot;  In talking to Leonard, the owner, he says that he routinely 
has these cases align-bored now, just because they're all staring to see 
a lot of miles.

I emailed Bus Depot about bearings for the align-bored case and didn't 
hear back from them, but I got my bearings from AVP.
