&gt; Subject: Long distance Towing
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Folks,

&gt; The van in question has no transmission, but the axles are still in place.
&gt; The owner has heard that moving the van without the transmission may damage
&gt; the wheel bearings. Is that so?

	How could this even be possible? The wheel bearings do not interact
with the transmission in any way. Do not fret. Tow away. Obviously,
you'd want
the half shafts to be removed so they don't flop around.
 
	There are some transmission designs that require the input shaft to be
turned
in order to provide proper lubrication to the bearings inside the
tranny.  The VW bus
isn't one of these [poorly designed] vehicles.

&gt; If it is,  would there be any problem towing the van with the rear wheels on
&gt; the dolly instead?

	You could also do this, but the likelyhood of ending up with a
dogtracking
van is higher. The front end likely has some toe in that will make it
non-ideal.
Tow the van from the front. You have less to worry about that way.

&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

	Make sure that the dolly you are using has working trailer lights. The
weather
has been universally foggy lately.  Make sure to allow yourself extra
distance to stop
and accelerate. All the usual safety stuff.
 
Enjoy the drive :)
