&lt;&lt; s it really that easy to remove a engine from a type 2...all the reading 
ive done just makes it too simple....anything i have to be careful of?
 &gt;&gt;

Really easy up to '71 because of the removeable bracket under the lid. A
lot more after that because of the non-removeable bracket and heavier
engine.
