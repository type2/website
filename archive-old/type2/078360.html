Subject: Re: [T2] replacing windsheld and rubber together?

On Tue, 4 Dec 2001, William L. Nothstine wrote:

&gt; Here's my question: Putting aside cost questions [for the moment!], does it 
&gt; make sense to replace the rubber without replacing the glass? Or is that 
&gt; being penny wise and pound foolish--is it better just to replace them both 
&gt; at the same time and be done with it?

glass is one of those things that is either good or Bad, very little
in between if the glass is good it can be reused nothing to be gained by
replacement.

&gt; Also, while the glass is out, there are some pinpoints of rust and one dent 
&gt; to be fixed, and possibly some more under the old rubber, if that makes any 
&gt; difference.

that makes a difference.

order of work needed

. replace rubber
. fix body work
. replace glass
