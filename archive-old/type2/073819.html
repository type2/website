Subject: Bumper Removal on '75 Van

Hi,

I'm carrying out some bodywork repair on the rear left corner of my van, but
I really need to remove the rear bumepr so I can get to the area properly. I
assume that the bumper is held on by the 4 bolts on the bumper stems. The
far two nuts (the ones furthest from the rear of the vehicle, on both stems)
come undone easily, but the near two won't budge an inch. I've been applying
WD40 on the nuts for the last week to no avail. Any reason why these nuts
won't come undone? I don't want to force (insert rachet extension pipe here)
them if there is a reason they don't come undone.

Thanks,

Paul James
