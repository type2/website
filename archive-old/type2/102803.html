Subject: loss of oil pressure symptoms

My newly rebuilt 2 liter suffered the oil pressure light coming on yesterday.  During my break in period, I have been using straight 30 wt oil. I have got about 400 miles on the new engine.   The light came on at idle, about 800 rpms, would go out at 1100 rpms.  This is after driving for 60 miles with one stop to check on things. I drove up to a ski resort, nice easy gradual accent. the temp was about 22, elevation 4500 when I stopped and the light came on.  Should I be concerned?  Is it just because the cold temp and oil wt.?  

Again, light on at Idle only, about 22 degrees using 30 wt oil. goes out at 1100rpms.

BTW, my engine was very cool after the drive, I could even touch the top of the block with it burning my fingers.  I do not have a head temp gauge so i don't know those readings.  Also, I have not had the light come on at sea level where it is consistently warmer.

Thanks,

paul.
