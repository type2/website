Subject: Re: [T2] Cabin Heat (Was: Story:)

Don, it's not such a big deal to stress over. I was given a 72 bus
that someone had put an upright engine from a 68 or so into. Therefore
I have not had the overhead heater booster blower fan that everyone
else's type IV motors have. But I can tell you the impeller fan on the
motor blows plenty of warm air into the cab. It's a little weak at
idle is all. If you want to add some volume, you can just add an
inline fan somewhere in the duct system instead of hassling with
restoring your heater system to stock. You will get far more mileage
out of the simple basic things like making sure your ducting is all
sealed so your hot air actually makes it to your cab, and having good
seals on your doors and windows so you do not take in cold air faster
than your heater can put out hot air. Look at the library and
ratwell_dot_com for the articles on improving the efficiency of your
heater.

 Mine's hosed too, and I never thought I'd care because I'm in Southern

 NOOOOoooooooooo..........
 
 I took a look around to see what I needed. Obviously heat exchangers
 since I'm running Type 4 car HEs that don't line up with the
 connectors and ports. And the hoses from the blower are missing too.
 
 But on top of that, the flaps are rusted to powder and the cables are
 all broken. It's going to be a nightmare trying to get it going.
 Sigh...
