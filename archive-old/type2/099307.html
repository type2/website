&gt; Subject: Crashed my bus....
&gt;
&gt; About an hour after finishing replaing the ball joints on my 71 Westy, I got
&gt; into a crash.  The wreck was the other drivers fault, she admitted it and
&gt; there were lots of witnesses.  Anyway, just wondering how much this is going
&gt; to cost to repair, if its worth it, tips for dealing with the insurance
&gt; adjuster, etc?  I've posted some photos at http://bcmiller.cjb_dot_net/bus.html
&gt; Thanks for your feedback!

A good body shop can hook that up to a frame machine and pull it out almost as good
as new.  A poor body shop will beat on it or hack pieces out of it and it will never
be the same.  That's fairly simple damage if approached correctly.
