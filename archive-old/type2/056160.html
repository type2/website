 I now own a 1972 Camp-mobile.  This &quot;new&quot; VW is in need of repair
but it runs, is licensed for the road (not only marking it's spot, it marks
everything), and is almost complete interior.

My request is finding a good air-cooled VW mechanic in the Durham/Raleigh
area of NC.  It would also help for a good supplier of new and rebuilt parts
in the area.  I'm new to the area so I haven't found a mechanic yet.  Need
to find someone soon to help correct the bad oil leak. Thanks
Dave,
  I can recommend 4 VW mechanics in the Ral/Dur area:
  1. Sean Frazier at Transporter Werkes 834-2800 
  2. Charlie Reynolds at Repair Service 821-0007
  3. Danny at Danny's Foreign Car Repair 828-7032
  4. Hicks Garage in Durham (except he dosen't like type 4 engines and
dosen't      want them in his shop)

  Hope this helps.
