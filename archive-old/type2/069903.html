&gt;Steve says &quot;hold 2nd gear to 27-30&quot;.  I agree with 27, definitely NOT
&gt;30, though.  Then, he says to &quot;hold 3rd gear to 45-47&quot;.  I really disagree
&gt;with this point. eP  I hold 3rd to 42 at the MAX!!  I think my engine would
&gt;blow at anything past 42(in 3rd).

I routinely take mine to 45-50 in third if I'm trying to get any
acceleration done. I would also do this up hills if we had any of those,
but we don't. These boys need to stretch, it's the only way they can
breathe and the only way we can get any power.

In motorcycles, the sound is called &quot;packed.&quot; It's loud, I guess, but an
aircooled can do it all day, and it's better off that way than laboring in
a lower gear. You won't hurt anything from revving it high, but you most
assuredly will from shifting too soon.
