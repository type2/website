Subject: Re: [T2] timing mark on fan

&gt; I finally got around to checking the timing.  The old metal
&gt; timing indicator was almost impossible to see.  I replaced it with a
&gt; plastic one I had and took a look.  16 degrees BTC!  Well obviously
&gt; not.  I fooled around with the distributor and my motor runs best at
&gt; 16 BTC indicated.

That could be to compensate for a vacuum leak or other problem.

Here's how the scale is marked:

&gt;I also looked at another fan I have and the timing
&gt; mark (notch) is nowhere near where the one in the car is.  There is a
&gt; white paint mark on my spare, but that is also not near where the one
&gt; in my car is.  So how can these marks get so far off?

Here's how to find the notch:

&gt; These fans 
&gt; only go on one way, right?  And the hub only goes on one way on the
&gt; crank, right?  I know there is a pulley between the fan and the hub.
&gt; But isn't there a registration pin that goes from the hub and into
&gt; the fan?  And even if I had the fan on the hub wrong wouldn't it be
&gt; 120 degrees off not 20-30?

Correct. The problem that can occur is if the PO separated the fan and
pulley and put them back together 90/180/270 deg. off.

&gt; So what is the easiest way to determine TDC on #1 and get things lined up?

Set the engine to TDC #1 as indicated by the distributor rotor and check the
state of the valves. You can verify the position of the valves using this
graph I made (valve height vs. time):

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Maintenance3/247-TimingChart.jpg

When #1 valves are closed you can see on the graph (last vertical line where
it says TDC #1), which valves are in which position based on their position
relative to the vertical line:

#4 Intake open
#4 Exhaust closed
#3 Exhaust about to close
#3 Intake starting to open
#2 Exhaust open
#2 Intake closed

If your distributor is 180 degrees out the engine won't fire properly unless
the spark plug wires have been swapped around.
