&gt; My bus is a 75 and the manual says you can barely remove the tank cover

&gt; for so many years but am afraid to bend it and want to be assured I am not
&gt; missing anything.

There are two screws (maybe four on some years?) on either side of 
the transmission that come up from the bottom.  Don't know why VW did 
that but it's a pain if you don't realize they are there.  Also if 
you are doing this with the engine in, you can get a little extra 
room by taking off the distributor cap and rotor, and by unbolting 
the rear hanger bar and letting the engine drop a little (like maybe 
an inch).
