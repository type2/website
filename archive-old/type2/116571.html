Jasan,

sounds like people are thinking that the decel valve
has fuel connections. (&quot;drying out&quot;)

it doesn't. it's a vacuum part. the one I got out of
the yard made an instant noticable difference. 

that's what the yards are for. give it a shot.

I don't understand why people are crapping on you about this. $100 parts are exactly what we try to avoid on this list every single day.

Later,

Billy

&gt;&gt;(especially when they are allowed to dry out after &gt;&gt;having once been used),
&gt;&gt;that your lucky junkyard find will be a short-lived &gt;&gt;delight.

&gt;Well for only $5 I thought I might as well give it a &gt;try.
