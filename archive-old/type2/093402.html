&gt;Bob,

&gt;I just had my engine rebuilt by Bob Donalds (Boston Engine) and he gave me a
&gt;Berg dipstick and also gave me quite a lecture on engine heat.  He swears by
&gt;the Berg dipstick.  He claims that when the dipstick goes on full, your heads
&gt;are just beginning to overheat.  Keep pushing it from there and you're
&gt;eventually going to have some serious damage as the head temp starts to
&gt;skyrocket.  He claims that it is the nature of the T1 engine (especially 
&gt;in the
&gt;Bus) to have a heat build-up.  He says the right thing to do when the light
&gt;starts to flicker is pull over and let the engine cool down.  He also said 
&gt;that
&gt;most cylinder temperature gauges are useless; by the time they respond the
&gt;damage has been done.  Bob has test data that he collected while working with
&gt;the Berg folks on engine heat.

Oh Oh,
Given this info, I think I have to go to an assumption that is pretty bad...
That being ... &quot;My buses cannot be driven in Texas heat.&quot;

But I do drive in Texas heat, and I have not had a temp related 
problem,,,,,, so far.

Yes, I agree that measuring the oil is the way to go, (sense the heat 
transfer fluid before the heat gets transferred) but it just seems to me 
that a set point of 227 degrees is a number that only allows me to be out 
on the road with the vampires.

Others ??
Please jump in with personal experiences or knowledge.
