&gt; I guess this leads me to another question.   What is it about busses that
&gt; make life so difficult for the fuel lines?  Is it just age or a combination

&gt; my being naieve and maybe this is common with all old cars but it seems
&gt; particularly important with busses.
&gt;
&gt;    I can't think of another current car with a gas tank mounted above the
engine...Most old cars have the same problem with rubber lines deterior-

it continues to feed itself...;-(
