Subject: Re: [T2] Too many questions?

Heh. I bet I post WAY less usefull stuff than you. Like this. 

Is a Cold Start Valve any different than a normal fuel injector, or
can I just put in a normal fuel injector? Mine seems to have gone bad
(clogged probably). Nope, sorry. Didn't check the archives. It's
probably their, but this is just SOOOooo much easier, and sure to hack
off TR. :D

Also, I'm thinking about picking up a karmen Ghia (SP?) and I was
wondering if any listees have any that could P-Mail me. I've got
several questions about them.

And I've WAY got to agree with the previous poster who said that this
guy probably ISN'T THE T.R. HENNESSY. This guy is a dope, and a loser.
(Yeah, that's a LOT coming from ME! Lol) and the THE t.r.hennessy is a
well written/spoken guy according to the google search I did. :D  And
of course it was sent to the wrong address obviously since he started
it &quot;David and Susan&quot;.  But I like this sort of thread so I just HAD to
jump in. Lol

And oh yeah, Great news! I got a job that pays good finally. So this
summer my little green troll will get some cash dumped into it and
made to look as nice as this list has helped me get it running. Does
that sentence make sence? Dunno, don't care. :D
