Subject: removing campmobile equipment

Volks,

It's time for me to remove all my Campmobile equipment...
prepping for an in/out paint.  My Bentley has the procedures for
&gt;73 but not the late Westies such as my '78.

I've searched the archives and library: nil.

I do know that certain parts must be removed before others can...
so... is there a link somewhere to the procedure?  Or does
someone perhaps have one off the top of their head - tips, etc?

Cheers,

Justin L. Smith
