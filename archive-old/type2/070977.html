&gt;  I own a '79 2.0 Fuel Injected Westy. Recently I had a sudden fuel leak out
&gt;  on the road.  It was a lot of gas and only leaked when the engine was
&gt;  running.  I got home before it started a fire but I am having trouble
&gt;  figuring out where it was coming from. It seems to be coming from inside
&gt;  the gas tank compartment, but after taking the panel off I can't tell what
&gt;  might be the source.
&gt;  	Could it be coming from the sending unit somehow?
&gt;  	Is there anyway to fix without pulling the engine?
&gt;  Thanks in advance.

Hi Troy (et al),

First thing is that if a fuel leak only occurs when the engine is running 
then it must be in a pressurised part of the fuel system ie after the pump.

It may be that the only way to find it is to run the engine - but do that as 
a last resort.

With FI there will be a fuel return loop - this allows surpluss pressure from 
the fuel distributor to be returned to the tank - it prevents the fuel in the 
fuel distribution system getting hot, vapourising and causing air locks. If 
the leak appears to be &quot;from the tank&quot; but only when the engine is running 
then I would look at that part of the fuel circuit first.

Good luck
