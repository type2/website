Subject: 72 tranny into 71?
Date: Sun, 24 Jun 2001 14:39:22 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

My 1971 bus is making a loud knocking sound at the rear of the bus whenever
I make right turns.   I only notice it when I am turning slowly, not when
moving fast.  Of course it could still be knocking when I am moving fast, I
just can't hear it from the drivers seat.   A friend, who is a Ch**y
mechanic, seems to think that it is the differential.  Anyone
concur/disagree?

Which brings me to my second question.  I got this 1972 Adventure camper
sitting in my backyard, engine in pieces in the garage.  Since that 72 is
just sitting there waiting for me to get around to either selling it or
rebuilding the engine, I figured that I could just take the tranny out of
the 72 and install it in the 71, then get the tranny rebuilt for the 72.
This would kill several birds with one stone as the 72 shifts like new,
while with the 71 it is always an adventure finding the gears.

So, can I install the 72 tranny into the 71?  I figure I will need to get a
71 clutch.

Finally, I have asked this before but haven't gotten a response.  Does
anyone know of
a good VW friendly paint and body shop in Southern California, preferably
near the Inland Empire?

Thanks,

Mark Van Dam
