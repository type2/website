    And how about that oil cooler sticking up in the fan housing on the
    T-1, blocking cooling air to #3 cylinder? Good design, eh? Oh yes,
    wonderful!

my first VW, a '64 bug I bought where it sat for 2+
years, dropped a valve in the #3 almost immediately.

the fact that it did this at 60 mph downhill in a
thunderstorm at midnight on the 4th of July only
added to the excitement (720 degree turn, e.g.)

still have the piston as a conversation piece.
