Subject: First time engine puller needs help in Fullerton, CA

Hello,

I have a 72 westy(Type I engine), and is planning to pull the engine out
soon, and this is my first time pulling the engine out myself. I live in
Fullerton, CA and need someone to guide me with this project. I will be
happy to compensate monetarily. I worked on many other things, but never got
to pull the engine out, and I need to change out oil cooler(leaking) and the
throughout bearing. I also need the person to advise me things to replace
when the engine is out.

Thanks for your help!
William
