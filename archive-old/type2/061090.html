I might be in luck. VW FLAPS owner lives around the block. I left a message
at his house earlier today that I was in need of pilot bearing.  He just
called back and said he had some stuff to do at the shop in the moring and
to come by and he would try to fix me up with the part. 

Looks like Sunday will be spent finding out if installation is really the
reverse of removal.
