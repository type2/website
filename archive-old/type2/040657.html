Would like to hear from someone who went to this event.

I had hoped to go, but was put off by car and wife on the sick list,
and on top of that the AccuWeather report at 0500a said cloudy and
rainy all day.  Around 0800a the forecast improved to just cloudy....
no rain.  Was the event well attended??  Thanx!
