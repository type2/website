Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny bushings, linkages, adjustments?

Dave,

Whoa!  I don't remember any spring down in the cup when I took mine out to 
grease it!  I wonder if I am missing said spring?

This picture doesn't show it...   
http://www.bug-bits.freeserve.co_dot_uk/ramva/fiche/t205700.gif

But! it also doesn't show the 3 bushings like I have either...


Cheers, dave

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The &quot;protrusion&quot; on the bottom of the shifter is a pin about an inch long
&gt; &gt;that goes thru the ball.
&gt; &gt;Remember that the pin has to be all the way forward.
&gt; &gt;The problem comes if it is at all back thru its hole.
&gt; 
&gt; The pin at the base of the shift lever also has another spring to provide tension
&gt; on the pin itself, which further complicates the reassembly.
&gt; The lever must be angled past the conical spring with constant tension and
&gt; fitted to the cup at this angle to complete the assembly in order for the pin to
&gt; fit the cup with it's other engaging spring.
