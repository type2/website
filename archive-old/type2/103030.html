Subject: Re: [T2] Gas tank problem

Paul,

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78bustankjob/  picture #12 is what came out 
of my tank.

Take it to the radiator shop and get it &quot;boiled&quot;...be prepared to repaint 
it on the outside with por-15 and read the faq(por-15) about what you 
might want to do on the inside....some have recoated and some of us have 
left it bare after using some of their other products to clean it more on 
the inside....archives have much info...

Cheers, dave

&gt; Dear List:
&gt;        Today I pulled a beautiful gas tank out of a 69 Westy. It looks like 
&gt; it did the day it was built. I thought the tank was empty but when I removed 
&gt; it from the bus it was full of old gas. I poured out the gas but there 
&gt; remains inside the tank 1-1/2&quot; to 2&quot; of slug tar). The tank does not need to 
&gt; be patched or sealed just cleaned. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks a 
&gt; million.
&gt;
