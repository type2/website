Subject: Re: [T2] 76 teardown

I've installed heads, pistons and cylinders with my engine in the
vehicle. Tough job but with the 80-83 big engine hatch it can be done.
After all was said and done I could have pulled the engine in the same
amount of time.
Rebuilding an engine is tedious, expensive and as we all know; hard work.
My goal is to do it right the first time and start enjoying life for
another five to seven years .... just get back to having a dependable
vehicle that doesn't limit my travels or cause me fear of failure at one
hundred mile intervals.
My persomal 83 Westy is such a vehicle and always has been.
I restore 80-83 Westfalias and the cost restrictions require fixes that
are less expensive but I still spend the money to put the new engine part
in if its needed. Things like fresh air blowers, fuel pumps, wiper motors
I'll install used parts on.
I view splitting the case as another six to ten hours of labor and I'd
split the case and pawn the stereo to get the engine rebuilt properly and
be done with it. There are simply some parts that need to be inspected
even if they aren't replaced.
---------- Snip -----------
I'd still not  recommend rebuilding the bottom end. I've done quite a few
that way 
 myself  and been quite pleased with the results.
