X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Scott,
  I would go to a Marine supply or RV place and by a ckt
breaker panal instead of a fuse holder. No more fuses to
replace!

--------------------
..... and radio.  My task now is to set up a 
seperate fuse
box for my solar.  Are there any thoughts on this?

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
