In my overall efforts to sell refurbished 80-83 Westfalias I've gone to
NADA many times and I've yet seen one of the $10,000.00 Westfalias that
NADA lists.
The value is determined by demand and in Texas there is very little
demand. I buy 80-83 Vanagons for $200.00 and part them out to restore my
next 80-83 Westfalia project cars that I buy for resale.
I'd say the biggest demand is in California and North to the Canadian
border but that is my take from reading the list.
The lowest demand seems to be Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas, N and S Dakota
it must be the cold, wind or just local lack of interest.
I can get a nice 24 ft six year old class C motor home in Texas for
around $7500.00 and I've turned them down at $2700.00 since I've had
about five of them since 1970 I'm wise to the problems of cheap
construction. We cannot park those big units in our neighborhood unless
you have a fence tall enough to hide it in the back yard and 8 foot is
the maximum for fence height in residential areas around Dallas TX so
you're stuck with storage costs.
I have no doubt that the Westfalia models will become real collectors
items within a few years but the 80-83 Aircooled that I deal with don't
seem to have the charm / nostalgia as the splitties and bays that will
currently bring more than the 80-83 Air Cooled.
Texas wrecking yards are full of WaserBoxers and are a good source for
trim, body, suspension and drive axles for me but I've never had any
desire to own one. The bodies and interiors are normally near pristine on
the WaserBoxers but hit the wrecking yards with a rod sticking through
the engine case.
The biggest faults with 20 year old Vanagons and Westy is neglect or
abuse. Unless you buy a unit from a genuine VW booster the rule is *Buyer
Beware*, you're going to need a set of heads.
I've found the Aircooled vans to be cheap to maintain as long as you do
the preventive maintenance and ease off on the accelerator when fighting
head winds or climbing big hills. 
The only engine part that has failed on my 83 Westy in the seven years
I've owned it was when I blew a piston (broke the lands on #3 piston)
going 85 fighting a head wind. That was entirely my fault, I knew better
than to push it that hard.
I've recently rebuilt my engine but that was only because the old engine
got down to 90 psi cylinder pressure and I just wanted to get the rebuild
out of the way before I turned sixty.
My rule of thumb in buying any 80-83 Westy is......... deduct the price
of a new engine and offer that amount. I'd use the same rule on any VW
van I purchased or have purchased. I sell my refurbished Westfalias on
that basis too; an 81 westy with 86K original miles sold for $3500.00
clearly less than the California price for the same vehicle and cheap
enough that a new engine (if it needed one) would be a worthwhile
investment.
