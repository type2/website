Subject: RE: [T2] Starter/Bus Depot

&gt; I can't help but say how great those guys at Bus Depot are.
&gt; Monday (a holiday) my starter failed,  I called em about 6PM
&gt; and ordered a Bosch Rebuilt starter for an auto tranny bus. 
&gt; not exactly a Stock item usually. Asked for expidited delivery.  
&gt; WED!! it was sitting on my doorsill. (they promised Fri)  WOW!

&gt; one little irony, the core charge and what it will cost me to 
&gt; return the core is about the same,.....but that is the 
&gt; shippers fault not Bus Depot


Thanks so much for the compliment, Bob!  I will share your post with the
crew so they know that their efforts were appreciated. You can find some
hints on minimizing return shipping costs at
&lt;http://www.busdepot_dot_com/returns.jsp&gt; . (In fact, these guidelines can be
helpful for shipping in general, whether or not related to The Bus Depot.)
