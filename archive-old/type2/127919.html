Subject: seat cover install

Well I appreciate all the responses! I have tried the
seat in the sun to warm it up trick.. no go.. seems
like everyone but me is talented enuff to do this! ;-)

Next I will try this one--
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;
&quot;I few years ago I recovered the bucket seats on my
'69 MG-C. The instructions
suggested draping saran wrap over the seat back, and
spraying a little silicone spray on the saran wrap.&quot;
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me What a long, strange trip it's been.
