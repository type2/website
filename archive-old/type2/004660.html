Never, ever, talk endlessly about how much &quot;adventure&quot; there is to owning an
old bus while at a show...

Our '75 Westfalia chose to take me at my word last night on the way home
from the Gorge VW Club's Gorgeous Gathering.  Started with a hot-start
problem after fueling-up immediately after the show (starter was hot because
I'm still getting used to my manual choke and had to re-start a few times
before I got the bus going).  Following that lovely push-start, we made our
way west down I-84.  In the middle of a one-lane construction zone, by westy
turned into a diesel with compression brakes.  For those who know my bus,
it's noisy, due to a recurring exhaust leak I've yet to fix correctly.  This
was a whole new level of noise.  At first I thought my daughter had opened
the rear vent window and I was just getting to hear the existing noise from
a different angle, echoing off the concrete barrier, etc.  Once we were
clear of the construction zone, I knew this was not the case.  The bus was
very sluggish, very loud, and we could begin to smell fuel in the cockpit,
not normal for this vehicle.  We limped to an exit, out of view from the
freeway, unfortunately, and I inspected the motor.  #2 spark plug was loose
at the end of its wire.  Same thing happened last summer with #1.  I always
torque them down carefully, per Bentley specs, and the threads are OK -
what's the deal?

What should have been a simple fix then turned ugly.  Looked in my toolbag.
I had my ratchet and extensions, but no spark plug wrench.  I began to lower
the plug into it's socket with my fingers, then something made me jump and I
dropped it into the black hole between the cylinders and the tin.  No spare
plugs on board.  No problem, I'll just fish it out.  It was Sunday evening
in the Columbia Gorge, so no point in calling AAA - where would I have them
tow me, since I just needed a plug and a plug wrench, and all the parts
places were presumable closed?

Three hours of jockeying the plug around with a very long screwdriver passed
before I finally weaseled it into a spot where I could get some needle-nosed
pliers around the tip and extract the plug.  I used the spark plug wire as a
plug wrench and installed the plug hand-tight.  Fired her up, the engine
didn't sound/feel any different than normal, so we continued home, listening
carefully.

This evening, I'll be re-torqueing # 2 and inspecting all my plugs for
proper tightness.  What would make a spark plug loosen itself like this?

Moral of the story - talk all you want about how much you love your camper,
but never, ever, brag about the adventure aspect of VW ownership.
