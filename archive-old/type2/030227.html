&gt; My 1971 bus is making a loud knocking sound at the rear of the bus whenever
&gt; I make right turns.   I only notice it when I am turning slowly, not when
&gt; moving fast.  Of course it could still be knocking when I am moving fast, I
&gt; just can't hear it from the drivers seat.   A friend, who is a Ch**y
&gt; mechanic, seems to think that it is the differential.  Anyone
&gt; concur/disagree?

Your friend would do well to stick to Chevys.  You have a CV or bearing
problem.  Time to inspect!
&gt; 
&gt; Which brings me to my second question.  I got this 1972 Adventure camper
&gt; sitting in my backyard, engine in pieces in the garage.  Since that 72 is
&gt; just sitting there waiting for me to get around to either selling it or
&gt; rebuilding the engine, I figured that I could just take the tranny out of
&gt; the 72 and install it in the 71, then get the tranny rebuilt for the 72.
&gt; This would kill several birds with one stone as the 72 shifts like new,
&gt; while with the 71 it is always an adventure finding the gears.
&gt; 
&gt; So, can I install the 72 tranny into the 71?  I figure I will need to get a
&gt; 71 clutch.

Just use the '72 pressure plate with the '72 transmission and you'll be
fine.  In any case, use a new friction disc.  If the '71 was built late in
the model year, it might have the same clutch.  Early '71s came with the
early clutch that had the ring on the pressure plate springs and no
sleeve around the transmission input shaft.
