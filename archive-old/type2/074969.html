Subject: [T2] Re: It's official now, the Times has spoken]




  :-(   How sad.  There goes my hopes of ever getting a new Bus from 
Brasil :-\

  Hey, has anyone ever put a new Brasilian dash into their 68-79 bus?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In Brazil, VW recently ended production of its &quot;combi,&quot;
&gt;otherwise known as the Microbus (and in Germany as the
&gt;&quot;bulli&quot;). The loaf-shaped, air-cooled van, officially
&gt;called the T2, was the successor of the original bus
&gt;sketched in 1947 by Ben Pon, the first American importer of
&gt;VW Beetles, and produced in 1950. In the 1960's, the bus
&gt;became a hippie clich=E9, chugging to rock concerts in
&gt;psychedelic paint jobs.=20
