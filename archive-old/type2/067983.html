Subject: Re: Want A List Coffee Mug???

&gt;Feel free to have a mass debate as to the various pros and cons of such a
&gt;modest proposal, and we'll see what comes of it.

I would personally order either a standard ceramic one, or the plastic one
with the skinny bottom to fit into my custom console for my bus (for
pictures, check out web page in a couple days).  I would prefer the
colorful 4- bus design, and I think I would only buy one if it were that-
being that my funds are not up to search and rescue par, I'm not really
into that myself although I respect and admire all of you that are....
