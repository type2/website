&gt; Thom - no offense, but it seems you could prolly afford to put this thing
&gt; out yerself! Don't know about conflict of interest rules, but... once the
&gt; hard part of assembling the data is done, replication should be easy enough
&gt; - hell, if the neanderthals who swipe porn offa the Net and compile it
&gt; into CDROMs can do it (uhhhh.... so I've heerd tell!), so can you. Believe
&gt; me, if you can get the info down, you've got the thing paid for. You know
&gt; you have ~100 folks here who have cdrom drives (even tho I don't (yet),I'll
&gt; even mail in $100 deposit as soon as you are ready to go to press - so long
&gt; as its for a MAC!) who are a potential customer base for starters. You
&gt; could get together with the NEATO folks and add Mcodes, threads on starter
&gt; fixes, yadayada. If your company is too STUPID to recognize a market when
&gt; it runs over their foot, then perhaps some insightful entrepeneur will show
&gt; them the error of their ways, hinthint?

And if the demand is not big enough to justify the expense of getting CD's mass 
produced, I have a CD writer.
