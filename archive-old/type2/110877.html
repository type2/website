Subject: brake job

Hi. I am going to be doing a brake job all the way
around on my '78 westy. It has disk brakes in front,
and drums in the rear. I have several questions.
First, does anyone have a more detailed procedure than
what is in Muir or Bentley for replacing pads &amp; shoes,
adjusting rear brakes, and bleeding the whole system?

Question two: Do I really need any special tools to do
the rear drum brakes, or can I get by without buying
special tools? 

Question three: While I am in there, I will be
replacing all bearings and inspecting races. Is there
anything else I need to do while I have this all
apart?

Question four: while changing bearings in the rear, do
I have to remove the axle to get to said bearings? or
can they come out the front?

Thanks in advance,
Matt '78 westy, 'blue'
