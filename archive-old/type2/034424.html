Subject: Re: [VB] diesel

Green diesel is for over the road use. (Fed &amp; State Hikghway taxes were
paid) Low sulfer content
Red diesel is for off road use (no taxes paid) -- High sulfer content.
bad for newer vehicles, causes havoc with emissions system.  It will do
in an emergency-eg small town that doesnt have diesel fuel, but has
graders and other construction equiment--from first hand experience &lt;g&gt;.
I could have sworn I saw blue diesel once upon a time, but cant remember
(maybe for marine applications if it is).

You can also use double filtered #2 heating oil in a pinch, albeit its
the most illegal way to go.

&gt; &gt; Hi Isaiah
&gt; &gt; Let me make sure I read this right - You pulled up to a pump and 
&gt; watched
&gt; &gt; the guy put the diesel in and now you want to know what recourse 
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; have against the gas station?!
&gt; 
&gt; but as he said it was being pumped from a &quot;GASOLINE&quot; pump  also if I
&gt; remember my Diesel color codes, isn't it boat diesel that is dyed 
&gt; green,
&gt; that wasn't even motor fuel, if nothing else the company could be 
&gt; gotten
&gt; for not paying the motor fuel tax.   sounds like some supplier 
&gt; dropped the
&gt; wrong fuel into the wrong tank....most pump jockeys have no clue as 
&gt; to
&gt; what they are pumping...
&gt;   not sure what diesel does to a gas engine, probably not as bad as 
&gt; what
&gt; gas does to a diesel engine (ask me how I know, I owned some buses 
&gt; and one
&gt; of my employees pumped gas into a bus, not VW type bus !)
