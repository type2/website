Subject: Re: [T2] What have I done?(front end)

Steve,


&gt;when you installed the upper arms, they did point toward the rear of the
&gt;bus, check?  and you had a heck of a time prying the arms over the horn
&gt;and they do rest *on top* of the bump stop, check?

Check. toward the rear, hell of a time, right on top of stop smashing 
rubber.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Did I somehow mix up the lower torsion arms?
&gt;
&gt;The studs on all the ball joints do point down as they pass thru the
&gt;steering knuckle, check?

Check, all point down.

&gt;
&gt;If all of the above checks out, then you had to rotate all the trailing
&gt;arms during installation, so they can't be frozen and the four arms are
&gt;all different and can't be installed in the wrong positions if the studs
&gt;point correctly (down).  The Gas-a-Just shocks have some pressure in them,
&gt;but I have always been able to overcome it by hand, so it is not a
&gt;screaming lot of pressure, certainly not enough to hold the bus up to the
&gt;point where the bus is on the stops.
&gt;
&gt;As I sit here, I think of one other possible reason.  The idea (and you
&gt;are going to hate this) is that you have installed the new torsion bar set
&gt;upside down.  When new, the torsion bar set does not have an orientation,
&gt;they can be installed either way.  After having a bus sit on them for
&gt;20-30 years, tho, they do take a definite set.  If you have installed them
&gt;upside down, twisting the other way than they did in the bus they came out
&gt;of, then they will hold the bus up higher for a while... but they may
&gt;break shortly from being overtwisted.  The only solution would be to pull
&gt;the front end back apart, pull the bundle of leaves back out , reverse it
&gt;and reinstall.  I didn't have a problem with this on the '73, but maybe I
&gt;just got lucky.
&gt;

You're right, I hate that theory, but it does make some sense and is 
something I didn't think of or consider. After I lowered the bus and stared 
at its front end perplexedly, I figured that it had to be something with the 
torsion bars, if only they had been labeled when they were removed from the 
original bus. Of the two bars only one had the original weld(broken of 
course). I installed that weld end to the drivers side, upper tube. The 
other bar strangely had no weld nor any sign of ever having one. My old bars 
had welds to drivers side BTW.

So with your theory I would need flip the bars around and put the weld to 
the passenger side? If they are upside down then the 3 set screw holes per 
bar would not be there. Maybe I'm not understanding you correctly. When I 
installed the arms and the center set screw I took an awl and felt/looked w/ 
mirror for the hole before I put in the set screw. The bus does steer and 
roll, however, and that is all it will need to do at the body shop where it 
will be for the next three months until I get a chance to work on the front 
end.

Any other theories out there? (Pertaining to my front end)

Thanks,
Brandt
