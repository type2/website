Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel door &amp; Engine lid lock

Actually it is missing the key. when I bought it the key was missing. As for
the fuel hatch there is a hole that looks like it would except a lock, but
the locking fuel cap sounds like a good idea, but wouldn't i have to get an
alternate filler tube?

&gt; Hi Isaac,
&gt; There never was a lock on the fuel hatch. You could either add a cabinet
&gt; lock to the door or change the filler cap to a locking version. If your
&gt; engine lid lock is stuck its easily removed and repaired; try spraying it
&gt; with a penetrating oil.
&gt;
