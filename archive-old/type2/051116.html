 Put it on your calender, Sunday February 18, 2pm in Kansas City, a gasoline
 heater seminar sponsored by the local chapter of NEATO, the Kansas City
 Kombies.
 
 We still have not nailed down an exact location for the seminar, but we
 should this week.

sounds great, I wish I could make it.

I tried to start an Eberspacher BN4 yesterday.  I have two and they look 
okay, right, but I have no clue,  I do have some phocopies about them I was 
trying to comprehend.  I hooked up a battery + to the hot wire with inline 
fuse and ground to the brown wire and it didn't do nothing.     further 
perusal of the info I had talked about an A terminal- which coincidentally 
was on a relay with nothing plugged to that terminal.  when a hot wire was 
added to that the heater blower went on and blew air.  Cool.   

but the fuel pump did not pump.    I tried with the other one and same deal, 
blower goes, not fuel pump action.  Am I missing something here?   hopefully 
I have to find a magic wire to plug in.  there seems to be a place on top in 
the row of 5 colour coded wire connectors, the one at the right has an empty 
space, if I hook a hot wire to that does the fuel pump go on or do I reduce 
the eberspacher to slag?   

these two both say BN4, but are diff model?  idunno.  on the plate on the 
body of the heater thaere is a number that is not the serial number that is 
slightly dif, one I think is 1270, the other 1385.  mean anything?

I have an extra plate for where the eberspacher goes through the gas tank 
cover on a bay window. anyone interested in it?
