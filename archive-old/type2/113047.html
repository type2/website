&gt; While I was sitting at the stoplight I tried to shift from 4th back 
&gt; into 1st. It seemed to get stuck in neutral. I could get it into 
&gt; reverse, but no forward gears. I finally fiddled with it enough to get 
&gt; it into 2nd. Luckily I didn't live far so I could drive her home in 
&gt; that gear. Now she's stuck in that gear.
&gt;
&gt; She's a 1971 with a tranny from a 1969.  Has anyone had this problem. 
&gt; Is it a tough fix?

You might try checking the shift linkage, located at the nose of the 
tranny. A lot of people freak out unnecessarily when these go :-)
