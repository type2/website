Subject: Re: [T2] sanding brake pads/asbestos

To all,

New pads and drums made me grind down the shoe tangs to bring them into the 
adjustor range. Any comments?

&gt;
&gt;Yowza! watch out sanding possible asbestos carrying brake pads. I know 
&gt;Theodore is pretty knowledgeable about his bus, but for newbies, this is 
&gt;how you free asbestos into it's person-killing form. They say they're not 
&gt;asbestos anymore, but most boxes still carry the warning!
