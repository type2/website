Subject: brake bleeder

I need to do some brake adjustments this weekend, but there won't be anyone
around to help me bleed my brakes. I read in the library about a hose with a
one way valve and I was defintely interested.  I will go looking tomorrow, but
is this something i can find at my FLAPS?? How much do they run?? Also is the
bleeder valve a standard size, or do I have to worry about fit&gt;&gt;

Thanks

Zach
