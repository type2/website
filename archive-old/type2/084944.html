Subject: Re: [T2] Tail Light Troubles

Grounds in the system not working.

Get out your Bentley and start looking at the schematic.

&gt;alright..here comes my second question (one of many probs that i'm still 
&gt;tryin to figure out;(.
&gt;
&gt;i've been workin on gettin my TAIL LIGHTS in order. but i'm still stuck.
&gt;
&gt;so here it is: they work PERFECT, now, when my headlights are OFF. but 
&gt;when i turn my headlights ON....one of my brake lights comes on, on my 
&gt;passanger side taillight, without my brakes applied. and also when my 
&gt;headlights are ON, my turn signals don't work. everything works fine with 
&gt;my hdlights OFF. but w/them ON i have these problems.
&gt;
&gt;any ideas? is my problem in my dimmer relay, or in my wiring? i've messed 
&gt;with switching my wires around on my tail lights. checked to make sure my 
&gt;bulbs are in right. and i've replaced my wire connectors and cleaned up 
&gt;the terminals on the taillights. BUT, i'm still havin problems. which 
&gt;leads me to believe it's in my relay.
&gt;
&gt;thanks again for sharen the knowledge and ideas, they're much appreciated. 
&gt;*shine on* -Chris (newbie w/a 70westie)
