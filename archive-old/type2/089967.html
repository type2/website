Subject: RE: [T2] VW Type 1 List

There is already an email list for Beetles that's been around
for years.  Send an email to listproc_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu with
SUBSCRIBE VINTAGVW in the body.  While not specifically type I,
it seems that it's mostly Beetle discussions, and there's some
VERY knowledgable people on the list.  There's a guy on there
named Marc Vellat that seems to know as much as humanly possible
about VWs.  Also, for the past few years, there's been a guy=20
giving us weekly updates on his efforts to restore a Heb, very
interesting and sometimes funny accounts (and some not-so-funny)
of his trials and tribulations with his hired help.

&gt; Again, I apologize for marginal content, but I LOVE the T2=20
&gt; and VB lists so
&gt; much and have learned so much here, that I want to re-create=20
&gt; this atmosphere
&gt; in a Beetle setting and with beetle information. I sent out a=20
