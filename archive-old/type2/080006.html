Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a spare (camping) battery in to a 78 bus

I just put a few thoughts on a web page ,, I will update it a bit in the next
day or so,, but see if you get a charge [pun] out of this page?

&gt; This is really pathetic! I have the very same kit, instructions and diagrams
&gt; long stared at with cow-like incomprehension, sitting in a drawer at home,
&gt; along with a mighty 400-watt power inverter that I'd intended to put on the
&gt; second battery. Sadly, I won't even have the facilities to work on this
&gt; project until the summer, since I'm at school right now. If nothing else,
&gt; though, I'll solve this problem for us all in a few months, or die an
&gt; explosive electrical death trying.
