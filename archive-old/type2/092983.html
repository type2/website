Subject: Re: [T2] Petronix points eliminater good or bad?


&gt;I just installed a PERTRONIX in my vacuum advance distributor yesterday and
&gt;it made a WORLD of difference in the way my van idles, shifts. runs, etc.
&gt;
&gt;  I have also heard people who seem to not be happy with them.
&gt;
&gt;Make sure if you install it that your whole ignition system is up to snuff.
&gt;If you have old spark cables, distributor cap, rotor and a worn out coil,
&gt;you are just wasting your money on a PERTRONIX. After you install your
&gt;Pertronix, MAKE SURE YOU RETIME YOUR ENGINE. most people I have talked to,
&gt;never retimed their engines after the install and got crappy results,
&gt;(mainly because the Pertronix is so stable and the points and condensor are
&gt;not. You will notice the differance when you shine your timing light on your
&gt;marks.)
&gt;
&gt;I was running with all new stuff and points and condensor, my Van ran well,
&gt;I slapped a PERTRONIX in, in 5 minutes and my van is running better than it
&gt;ever has in 15 years.

Be sure to pay attention the coil resistance requirements and the max 
voltage requirements of your Petronix. There is a version 1 and version 2.

Get it right and I hear that they last a long time. Get it wrong and it 
will let you down at the worst possible moment. Keep the spare points and 
condenser in the toolbox (with you) and you can not possibly be stranded.
