Subject: aux starter switch

I've never cared for this kind of throwaway advice.  &quot;Don't work on your own
car because you haven't been doing it for X years like me.&quot;

Ask any mechanic/electrician: Properly terminated, secured wiring with
appropriately rated devices ARE safer than taped up hot wires tucked out of
the way.

The tone of the original question was one of a non-expert looking for some
basic, dependable, safe instruction, which has always been the flagship
product of this list.

&gt; a switch will have a spark also and if you can't see or smell  a
&gt; fuel leak then maybe you shouldn't be working on the bus anyway.

&gt; I have had such a wire in my bus for over 25 years now and have never had a
problem
