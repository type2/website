Hmmm. Playing the odds, that would make a
&gt; '71 (last 
&gt; year with up-
&gt; right engine, but with discs), the best choice for economy since most
&gt; Bug 
&gt; engine re-
&gt; lated equipment is readily (!?), available, hence cheaper.

True, but you will have to rebuild more often.  In the long run, the
type 1 engines are probably cheaper, but that will change if they stop
making them in Mexico.

 A complete
&gt; 
&gt; new/rebuilt en-
&gt; gine is often cheaper than the parts and labor for a major repair on
&gt; an 
&gt; upright. Carbs
&gt; are cheaper/easier to work on than FI.

Also true, but you will work on them a lot more often.

 An alternator conversion will
&gt; supply a 
&gt; decent
&gt; stereo and a larger battery (go head splurge- get an Optima).

A stock 38 amp bus generator and battery will supply just about any
stereo you might care to hook up.  If you need more current, you are
probably deaf!

&gt; OK,
&gt; it's slower 
&gt; than the
&gt; '72-'79...Leave earlier.

If you're looking for speed, you're not looking for a bus!
