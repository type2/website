Subject: Re: [T2] Anyone traveling thru....

If anyone is going south through Knoxville - I can meet you there and ferry 
it to Cookeville (halfway between Knox and Nash) where it can wait until 
Jason can get there. A dog list I'm on does this hand-off transportation 
all the time on pooches getting adopted halfway across the country. Works 
well.

IF this all acceptable to you Jason.


&gt;Is anyone traveling through Alexandria, VA down south in an westardly
&gt;direction (say toward Nashville, TN). I might lift an engine from the
&gt;hands of Steve Dolan. Problem is I don't have a free weekend anytime
&gt;near now, to drive the distance. I was hoping someone might have a
&gt;course that could perhaps move this motor to a lower lattitude :)
