Subject: Adapting Nose Panel?

Hello,

I have a 72 van that needs the nose replaced. All the replacement panels 
have the raised logo and the headlight at the top.

Has anyone been able to &quot;massage&quot; the panel to make it look original? If so, 
what did you have to do?

Thanks in advance,  Phil.
