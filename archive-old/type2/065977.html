Although I didn't get a chance to examine it closely, I saw a partition on a
non-poptop Westfalia at a used car lot near my home that was fashioned from
large strips of very heavy clear plastic hung just behind the seats. I think
the strips were about a foot wide &amp; looked to be about 1/8&quot; or thicker.
