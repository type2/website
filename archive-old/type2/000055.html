 Stock system..in good tune...no need to change....
 I dunno..you do the math....
 how many points/ign parts can u buy for $300 +  dollars..
  &gt;&gt;

who are you kidding ???  my pertronix system on my bug almost 8 yrs.
 my 2 buses over 4 yrs using compu-fire.  both for about $50.  the most 
expensive one was a crane/allison ignition xr700 and that was only $80.  all 
purchased new!!  the timing never, never, never changes.  i dont care how 
great you think points are, or if someone claims that their timing never 
changes.  bullcrap!!  the points wear, the timing changes.  as we know 
correct timing is one of the main points to keeping vw's running a long time 
on the road.

so you do the math...$50, never set it again, and have the timing exact 
forever.  

have fun,
zac
