Everyone in the Pacific NorthWest, mark your calendars.
Volkswagens of Western Oregon present:
A NEATO and LiMBO chapter event;

Jurassic Bug-In 2 happens Saturday, July 24, 1999, at the Oregon State
University Bon Fire field.  Show and Swap, free spectator admission,
Swap spots $10, Show $5 or $10.... 

Last year was our first event , and we had nearly 500 people. We hope to
improve this year. We have plans for a remote radio broadcast, and some
cool door prizes from local businesses. 

Free camping at Bug Werks, adjacent to the field on Fri Nite! 

This is the saturday of the same weekend as the Sunday Portland intl
raceway show, so if you come north from California, you can hit our show
on the way to Portland, and if you come south, you can hit Portland on
the way home...
