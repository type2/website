&gt; Thank you very much. I am going to print this message out and keep it to refer to.
&gt; I am thinking of building a custom cabinet to house my DVD player and TV which
&gt; will reside behind the front drivers seat so I can watch from bed. The DVD is
&gt; already set up for 12V but the TV I'm looking at is a standard 13&quot; using regular
&gt; 110V plug. ( I work for a DVD/TV manufacturer so I have access to  these items). I
&gt; have heard of a power inverter but I'm not sure if this is the route I should go
&gt; or if I should get a video source already made for automotive applications even

CRT's the tv screens of the standard type are monstrous energy
hogs...either get a LCD screen or better yet a LCD made for 12v

&gt; wether to get a standard battery or a marine battery.

get a wheelchair battery, or one designed for UPS

&gt; I love the curtain idea. Sounds perfect but does this mean I have to learn to sew?
&gt; I knew I should have paid attention in Home Ec. It's pretty sad when a good little
&gt; Mormon girl from Utah can't even sew or can peaches! :) I'm sure I can get one of
&gt; my friends to do the sewing honors.

but how many of those that can peaches can also fix a VW bus???
