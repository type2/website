Subject: Kool Patch alternatives?
Message-ID: &lt;382374B7.4D98B1CA_at_hawaii_dot_edu&gt;

List members,
    No one on Oahu sells Kool Patch, which I wanted to use to undercoat
my bus and seal the interior floor and sides.  Any experiences with
other similar products used to undercoat bus and or seal interior?

Mahalo!
Greg
