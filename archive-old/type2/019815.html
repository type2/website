Subject: [Fri.] BN4 Success


A BIG THANK YOU to Karl Von Salzen for supplying me with a BN4 heater
that fired up the first time I put power and gas to it. Now I just need
the templates to install it.  It's definitely gonna cut down on the
grumbling I hear from the passenger seat this winter;).  Has anyone else
noticed/tried the blurb  in the BN4 Factory Manual about installing a
thermostat. I was thinking about one that could be placed in line while
camping to cycle the heater on and off.

Have a great weekend all.
