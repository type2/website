Subject: RE: [T2] Oil sensor hole has rough face and leaks

That sensor seals with a tapered thread, not by sealing against that
surface. You should not be able to screw the sender in far enough to tighten
against the face anyway. Might crack the case if you did (DID crack my
master cylinder once).

Hello,

I have a 1970 Bus with a 1971 engine. Bought it about two weeks ago.

I had a VW shop go over it before I bought it, and they noticed there
was oil leaking around the oil pressure sender, so they replaced it.

I noticed oil dripping from the sender's nut today, and when I took it
off, I was surprised at the rough seam on the case, running right across
