&gt; After unloading the air shocks this morning, down to 25 lbs. ( minimum)

&gt; through a dip or hitting a bump.
&gt; 
&gt; What would be a good indication of the torsion bar being broke, other
&gt; than the rear end sagging?

If a bar was broken you would know it.  The bus would be way low on one
side.

&gt; The bus is equally low in the rear end, so I can't visually notice any
&gt; deviation from side to side. 

You just need to adjust the torsion bars.  They get a bit saggy in the
first 30 years or so.

&gt; I looked at all the rear suspension components, and there doesn't seem
&gt; to be anything broken , or out of line.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me reiterate, that Clementine rode really flat, level, and nice, for
&gt; about 20 minutes, until, she hit the first pot-hole in the road and
&gt; that's when the banging started.

Sounds like a shock problem to me, but I'm not there.  Set the bars
correctly, ditch the air shocks, and put stock shocks back on.
