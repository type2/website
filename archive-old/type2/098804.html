&gt; I occassionally go out on I-40 where the Speed limit is 70mph.
&gt; I didn't think that it should fly, but I keep hearing of people mentioning
&gt; speeds around 80
&gt; Anyway, I don't usually go flying down the road, usually 60-65.
&gt; I just wanted to get an idea of how I was doing compared to others with the
&gt; same setup.
&gt; I think I right in there.

Well, when the speed limit is 55, I drive about 58.

When the speed limit is 65, I drive about 58.

When the speed limit is 70, I drive about 58.

My '71 seems to like 58.  It will go a bit faster, but it doesn't seem as
happy.

A lot of folks have said that they feel intimidated by traffic passing
them.  I've never had any problem with it.  There are quite a few vehicles
going 55-60 even on roads posted higher.
