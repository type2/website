Subject: Ugh. Idling? Noise? Now no power?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey everyone!

 Where to start...

 About a week ago, my '71 bus was making a strange rattling noise while
going up inclines at high RPMs. It was suggested that my timing could be
off and that the sound I was hearing was predetonation.

 A few days ago, the bus wouldn't idle. Sometimes. Sometimes it wouldn't
idle if it was cold, like in the morning when I'd first start it. I'd have
to warm it up a bit by giving it gas, and then it'd be fine and off we'd
go. Sometimes it'd start right up and idle fine, but then later (usually
while going downhill to a stop before busy highway traffic, where I'd then
lose most braking ability) it'd stop idling.

 Then about two days ago, the engine started running really rough. It would
stutter while driving. When I push the accelerator, there would be a sharp
drop in RPM and then it would kick in. 

 Things like that.

 This morning I checked the timing and it was right on, 5* ATDC. The points
gap was on.

 However, I noticed corrosion inside the distributor cap, and the points
were not lined up correctly. 

 So I'm going to buy a new cap and points.

 When I unscrewed the fuel mix screw a few days ago(the large one on a
Solex 34 PICT-3) there was this black gunk on it. I cleaned it off, and
that helped with the idle problem. I unscrewed it today and there was more
black gunk, so I'm positive that the carb pretty dirty. I've got the
rebuild kit and am going to grab some carb cleaner today. 

 A friend and I were trying to get it to idle this morning. I'd keep it
revved while he adjusted the two screws. He says that the air mixture screw
had no effect on the performance of the engine, even when he operated the
accelerator from the engine. We could not get it to idle while we were
working on it. We gave up and decided that we had to get to work. As soon
as he drove off, I started up the bus and it idled fine. Go figure. 
 
 That's when I noticed that the power was greatly, greatly reduced.

 I'm hoping that maybe the jets are really clogged. Wishful thinking?

 What else might be wrong?

 Hopefully I'll get to work on that carberator today sometime.

 Thanks everyone for all the help you've given me in the past!
