Subject: Resurecting a Vehicle

Hi guys,

    This is kind of a follow up post to my other one so I'll keep it short
and simple. Basically the story is my bus was  a daily driver until about 2
years ago when it was parked due to engine problems. The engine's out and I
am rebuilding it, but what else should I be doing to get it prepared to go
back on the road? So far my  list as is follows

1.Redo brakes
2.Clean and seal gas tank
3.change oil in tranny
4.repack CV joints
5.repack wheel bearings
6.grease front end
7. new shocks
8.make sure all lights work

One question I have is how do you tell if a tranny is any good with out ever
having previously driven the vehicle? I know to look for oil leaks and any
shiny pieces in the oil but anything else a guy can do? It would really be a
crap happy occasion if I had to yoink the engine again to replace the
transmission.Other than that I plan to just take  things as they come. Few
minor electrical gremlins to sort through buy other than that I guess I will
just start driving it like VW intended it to be! please help me out with
suggestions here. well all fer now volks
VWMIKE
