Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 DP in a 73 Westy, how will it perform?

John,

I've got a '73 panel that a PO put a 1500 SP in.  The transmission is a
'72 but I believe it is the same as a '73.

Performance is a little better than snail like and I can cruise most
roads at 60.  On hills I drop down to 45 or so in 3rd.  

Short answer: It will work, but I'd rather have a Type 4, say around
2500 cc.

One important thing...  He will need the filler that goes between the
type 1 engine tin and the type 4 engine compartment.  I got mine (PO
didn't have one) from Creative Car Craft in Florida.

&gt; I've got someone that's interested in buying my 73 Westy but they have a
&gt; 1600DP that they want to put in the bus rather than the 2.0 that I have with
&gt; it.  They are wondering though how the bus will do with that engine.  Is the
&gt; transaxle that came in a 73 with a 17600 engine geared too high to use with
&gt; the 1600?  Did they keep the same gear ratios when they made the change from
&gt; the 1600 to the 1700?
