Subject: Re: [T2] brochures (tassles on poptop)

My 72 has them, and as far I know they're original. I was originally going 
to take them down because I thought they were not supposed to be there, but 
I have a '72 AD home that shows them in the photo.

&gt;The '74 ad also has 'em - just a little harder to see.  The '74
&gt;westy my ex-SO used to own also had these &amp; they appeared to be original.
&gt;
&gt;thanks to Rob for putting these on his site! keep up the good work!
