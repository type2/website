David,
	I use Redline S1 Fuel Injector Additive exclusively on ALL of my
VWs.  I have tried all others(having worked in the parts biz) and it's hands
down, noticeably the best.  You may have to go to a speed shop to get it
though, most FLAPS don't carry it. As for the oil add., I have had luck with
good 'ol Marvel Mystery Oil.  It is a non-synthetic, high viscosity oil that
actually has better qualities under high temps and pressures than your motor
oil.  It buffers the oil that is in there quite well.  I will say that if
you're looking for miracles, don't add anything to a gummed-up crankcase.
Start with a fresh engine and maintain it, don't try to resurrect a dying
one!

I did it! I took the plunge and am now the owner of a 77 Westfalia
Campmobile. I have started the renovation first by simply cleaning her up.
I am in need of some parts but primarily I am interested in a good service
manual. Does anyone have a lead? Also, my next step is to change the oil
and filters etc... Is there an oil treatemnet or addative that is
recomended for air cooled engines? I want to start with the simple things.
It seems like there are alot of disconnected wires hanging around. This
model camper has the stove, sink (with external pump), refridgerator (does
anyone know if this refridge is propane fueled -  how I may find out?). I
suppose these wires at one time were ment to opperate these features but
now hang uselessly waiting for someone to really love this poor neglected
van. I need some handles for the cabinet doors - the ones thaat have the
little button that you push to open...
Your help is super appreciated,
David Day
