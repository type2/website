Subject: Re: [T2] Insurance Questions

Hey Todd,

I use &quot;The Hartford&quot; and it costs me $50 extra bucks per month.  I thought
it was a little pricy as well.  As far as the VW being rated as unsafe,
that is a bunch of c##p.  My 91 Mazda Miata only costs me $60 a month and
that is considered a sports car.  The main expense of the VW was the
liablilty.  My father-in-law is my insurance agent and he was telling me
that liability is pretty much the same since hitting someone with the Bus
and causing injury is the same as hitting someone with a new BMW.

I hope that helps,
Don
