Subject: re: engine lid seal replacement tips? - loaf

        Bought my engine lid seal from RMMW I'm pretty sure- 
Brazilian I think.

        It was a bit too large in height (?!?!) so had to be scrunched
as I installed it. Took a couple of tries, using no adhesive, just
pushing with fingers. Ok in width. Works fine, 6 months later, though it 
sticks out a bit around the hatch.

        This on my '70 single cab.

        Good luck!
        Bill
