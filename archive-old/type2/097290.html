I noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in the noise level when I put the NASA
insulation in the engine compartment.

IMHO, definately the most bang for the buck.

Subject: [T2] Soundproof Challenge


&gt; Greetings list,
&gt;
&gt; I got my 78 Sagegreen Westfalia back from the paint shop a few weeks ago.
It
&gt; is a total shell. I have read the heat, rust and noise article several
times
&gt; but I don't think I have the budget for that extensive of a soundproofing
&gt; project (Q-pads=$$$). Also, I am skeptical about coating the inside of my
&gt; bus with cool patch. Odors? I plan to cool patch the underside of the
&gt; vehicle though.
&gt;
&gt; My question/challenge is if you had $200 to put into soundproofing what
&gt; materials would you get and where would you put them?
