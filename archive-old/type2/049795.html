Subject: [T2] glovebox handle

Hey guys-
I just received my glove box handle in the mail and am totally disappointed
because it is soft, pliable plastic. It won't adequately turn the bolt that
is there to open the box. I had in mind that the original handle would have
been made out of hard plastic in order to be able to turn the handle. Is it
really soft and then just hardens over time?

Thanks!
Cara
