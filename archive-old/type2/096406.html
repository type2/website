&gt; The tubes from the fan to the heater boxes do NOT have any asbestos.  As
&gt; Richard said earlier, there is (or was)  asbestos in the heater boxes and
&gt; in the flex tube collars from the heater box to the body.  That is all
&gt; there is, AFAIK, and it is a hard pad.  I don't worry about it.  any loose
&gt; fibers went away 20+ years ago, as long as you don't play with it.

Uh, what if we played with it?  I specifically remember monkeying with
these tube collars when removing/replacing my engine to work on the heads.
I also remember that is was a pain to get back together... lots of
wriggling and dust.  I also remember a lot of banging around on the heat
exchangers when trying to reassemble these, too.  So, this asbestos is
gonna be blowing in the heating system of the bus I've been fixing for
the past three months?  A bus that will be used as a camper for my 4 month
old, 5 year old, and wife?

Seriously, how much of a concern is this?

&gt; If you want to be paranoid, Ron (busdepot) or any VW parts source will
&gt; sell you heater boxes and bushings, but it will be $500+

AFAIK, '79 Cal heat exch parts are rare and/or expensive... Sigh...
