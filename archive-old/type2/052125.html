&gt; I started a hunt for a way to quieten it down. VW's are pretty noisy
&gt; sometimes of course.
&gt;
&gt; Finally I started talking to local roofers - specifically ones that worked
&gt; on commercial flat roofs. One very helpful fellow here in middle TN took
&gt; the time to show me the materials he uses which were mostly as you can
&gt; imagine, the standard thin tar papers.

&gt; He questioned me to the exact trade name of the stuff in the magazines
&gt; (Dynamat) and told me he was sure that Dynamat was a 'John Mansfield Co'
&gt; trademark and was generally used (as I understood it - our conversation
was
&gt; held during a hard rain under a tin roofed pavilion) for walk mats in
&gt; roofing - sections of flat tar roofing with a thicker membrane suitable
for
&gt; foot traffic (maintenance people). It was also cheap and very similar to
&gt; what I purchased - naturally he had my stuff in stock and didn't have the
&gt; raw Dynamat though he said he could get it if I wanted to wait a few days.
&gt;
&gt; So looks like the magazine guys are making a fortune off of folks willing
&gt; to pay retail price for Dynamat. My version won't have peel and stick
glue,
&gt; so I'll have to use spray can glue I think, but I am very excited about a
&gt; successful hunt!
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps some of you out there.

Chris n all,

I think you'll find that another common name for this tar sheeting is
&quot;Malfoid&quot;, at least that's what it's known as in the old boating set ( I've
got friends with old boats, and this WAS the &quot;proper&quot; was to seal wooden
decks on the early 20th Century work boats ).

Probably the easiest way to confirm whether we're talking about the same
thing is, does it come with a sand layer to prevent the sheets sticking
together, and does is split easily if you try and bend it without heating
it? If so, we're probably talking about the same thing. If so, older &quot;work&quot;
boat Chandlers would probably stock it as well, and the price isn't too high
there, either.

NB. The traditional way of fixing it down is with tins of thinned tar, think
yourself lucky you used spray adhesive, you were as much tar as the surface
you're fixing the sheeting to when you spend a day on your knees with a 4&quot;
brush!

Regards,

Neale
