Subject: [T2] Windshield - hammer - teardrops!

Derek,

    I don't mean to disagree with you, and I'm certainly not here to put you
down, but I would never hit a windshield, or the seal with a hammer,
plywood, or my hand,  no matter how carefully or softly, a whack is a whack!
    I think you were very lucky not to have broken your glass. I'll bet it
wasn't cold in the shop where you were working.
    Please consider trying this next time. Make sure the glass your working
with is warm, warn and stretch out the seal slightly, get a helper to hold
the seal as you go around the glass, use a length of 10 gauge wire to pull
the seal in with, wrap the wire in the grove so the ends over lap at the
bottom middle of the glass, liberally spray the rubber seal and windshield
opening with silicone spray lube, with a helper place the glass in place
with the wire in the grove, have your helper follow as you pull the wire
around the glass a little on one side and the other applying even pressure
with the palms of his hands. The glass/seal should slide in place, you may
need to work the seal in place with a nylon glass tool (body shop supply
store $2.00) by &quot;picking&quot; the rubber over the lip with the tool. The deal
is, if the rubber is in place the glass should also be in place. It's also a
good idea to make sure there are no sharp points or edges in the windshield
opening, and that it is very clean. seals with chrome moldings should have
the molding installed first.
    Well I hope you take this as it was intended, good luck next time.
