Subject: Window Rubber

As I come close to the day to paint my 72 Westy &quot;HOSS&quot;, &quot;We just Named
Him&quot; I want to do it right and remove all of the windows.
I read in the archives problems people have had getting the glass back
in with today's rubber, specifically the 2 rear windows on the side.
For those who have done this could you please advise on concerns or
issues that might arise. Is this something I could do myself with a
helper or leave it to a professional? I have read all of the string and
glycerin tricks and feel like I should be able to install them myself.
Also how about the Chrome Window Scrapers on the front doors, are the
new ones still a poor fit? How hard are they to get in? Mine are all in
decent shape so I really don't have to replace them unless the new ones
fit good and are easy to replace.
And finally what is the best type of rubber in the list opinions, WCM,
Wolfsburg West, Or others. I read where someone from the old Volks Home
made his own rubber, how about his?
Thanks
Meredith
