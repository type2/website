Subject: Re: [T2] Ignitor II was Can't increase vacuum

Ignitor I is a simple points replacement.

Ignitor II is an improved version that varies dwell at different rpm ranges 
to keep the coil saturated at high rpms and thus make a better spark.

Both &quot;fit&quot; the distributor.

One of the two requires less than 12 volts (I think version I) so be sure 
that you don't give it more than 12 volts or you will cook it. The 
requirement is actually amperage - measure the resistance of your coil and 
then using the voltage/current/resistance equation figure how low you have 
to take the voltage.

Look for a post from me in the archives about a week ago.


&gt;I'm planning to do this sometime also but I wanted some experience setting
&gt;the points gap because I'd never done it before.
&gt;
&gt;Will the Ignitor II work with a 78?  Not much info at the Pertronix site and
&gt;some suppliers I found show n/a for 75-78 busses and only list the original
&gt;Ignitor.

Ciao!
