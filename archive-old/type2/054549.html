Subject: Re: Listing of Bus names and Licenses Plates?

Matt,
no clever plate here, but as far as a bus name...my
bus is named lizzy, for Lizzy Borden who gave her
parents all those whacks w/ an axe, seeing the
previous owner got drunk and took out some frustration
on lizzy's driver side with an axe:)   but shes in
loving hands now.
