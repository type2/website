Subject: Re: [T2] heli coil

William,

Just went thru this yesterday as I was mounting my air conditioner 
compressor mount.

Sure, I have a 9mm x 1.25 tap, but I'll be derned if I could find a
bolt like that anywhere.

Called a VW buddy and he brought me his helicoil kit with an 8x1.25
replacement.

Personally, on t1 heads, I would put an oversized stud in that is 10mm on 
one side and 8x1.25 on the other...*never* had one of those come out.
Don't know if there is enough room for that in a t4 head.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I ripped a stud straight out of my 1800 cyl. head when mounding the damn
&gt; heat exchangers. Does anyone know where to get a good deal on a heli coil.
&gt; I am trying to tap it 9mm w/ 1.25mm thread right?
