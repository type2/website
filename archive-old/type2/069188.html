&gt; hey..i checked up on this self curing rubber tape..i found it at a local 
&gt; rubber products supply house..&lt;here in KC..forgot the name..&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Its in rolls, 1 inch widde, by 55 ft long. and costs ~60$'s a role..

I bought mine in Sweden. Something like $3 for a 4&quot; diameter roll of
1/2&quot; tape. Now I remember why! Don't count on it being possible
to split the roll. The tape I have is rolled with a protective plastic,
much like any tape with adhesive on two sides. Unrolling it will
expose one of the surfaces.

For anybody is travelling to Sweden or Norway: I bought it at Claes
Ohlsson. Claes Ohlsson is the Sears of Sweden. Similar story:
Poor country boy starts selling clocks, and gets into mail order.
Now also has stores in the major cities.

While at a Claes Ohlsson store you can also pick up dirt cheap metric
fasteners, stainless and regular, Spare in-tank water pump for your Westy 
($15), DMM (throw away stupid test lights etc.) ($15), and countless other
items which won't impress your significant other. You can also buy baseboll 
caps with their motto (translated) &quot;We make men into boys&quot;.
