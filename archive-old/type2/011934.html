Also.... was fueling my '96Jetta last week at  a gas station which will
remain anonymous. They had ran out of Regular (87) and they told me i
could have Super (93) for the same price. At first i misunderstood the
guy and picked up the mid grade (89) and it wouldn't work. The guy told
me &quot;Oh yeah, the 89 is hooked up to the same tank as the 87&quot;.

Be careful and don't buy 89 octane! You may really just be paying for
regular!

Peace,
Keith
