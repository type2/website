This is a pretty vague method as well.  If you grab the dipstick right
after shutdown it will be cooler than if you grab it after waiting a few
minutes.  the reason is theat the upper part of the engine bay is normally
at outside ambient temperature while the engine is running, but rapidly
warms up after you shut it down.

the temperature of the dipstick is also highly dependnet upon the fit of
the engine tin in the dipstick's vicinity.  The little grommets and such
prevent hot air from being sucked up and warming the dipstick.

If you're consistant with how you check the oil, the dipstick temp can be
a valuable indicator of the engine's temperature.  If you aren't
consistent, it can be very deceptive.
