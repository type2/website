Subject: [T2] Deal on Heat Exchangers/Exhaust

&gt; Markus:  There is a whole lot of stuff in your system which is no longer
&gt; available. Consider replacing the whole system with the heat exchangers
and muffler
&gt; from the 72-74 or 79-83 Type 2.  These had exhaust manifolds
&gt; integrated with the heat exchangers. If your heat exchangers are not in
great shape,
&gt; you end up with fresh heat exchangers in the process.



Well, I wasn't going to mention it just yet, but since the subject has come
up... I have a killer deal on pretty much everything you need to make this
happen.

I currently have a complete, OEM style '72-74 exhaust system with STAINLESS
STEEL muffler for $179.95 (part number 071 251 053EKS). Nobody else has this
Stainless system. If the Stainless is outside your reach, I have the same
thing in non-stainless for $119.95, part number 071 251 053EK. Either is a
direct fit on '72-74 busses, and also on '79-83 non-California
busses/vanagons (albeit without cat or egr provision).  Fits '75-78 if you
also use '72-74 heat exchangers (below).  Either will blow away the
extractor systems in terms of fit and quality. The stainless one is the best
you can put on your bus bar none, and worth the price difference if you can
swing it. (To put it in perspective, everyone else charges $180-plus for the
_non_ stainless stock system.) Both are in stock.

But the big news is that for the first time ever, I have (in a container
arriving from Europe in about 10 days) a small quantity of N.O.S. genuine
Volkswagen GERMAN heat exchangers to make the system complete - for less
than everyone else is charging for aftermarket ones. I will have only about
six matched pairs of heat exchangers, for $399.95/pair.  But I will also
have extra left-side heat exchangers for those who bought my N.O.S.
right-side ones last year (at which time I couldn't get N.O.S. left sides).
If you bought a right side from me, you can get the matching N.O.S. left
side unit for $129.95.  These heat exchangers fit '72-74, but can also be
used on '75-78 (non-catalyst) busses if you use the matching exhaust system
(above).  As has been noted, this configuration eliminates the
now-unavailable header pipes and crossover pipe used on U.S. spec '75-78
busses for once and for all.  (In fact, this is the setup that the rest of
the world used on all busses from '72 on; only we lucky U.S. folk got the
convoluted '75-78 setup with downpipes and crossover pipes, which is
probably why they've been obsoleted.)  Part numbers 021 256 091M for the
left side only, or 021 256 092PR for the pair.  NOTE: I am offering these
exclusively to Listmembers first, and will only what's left to the general
public. Therefore the website does not mention the existence of these items
in German (and shows a higher price).  But you will get the above prices
(and the German parts) IF you ask for them and specify that you're a
listmember.  Of course they will not ship until my shipment clears customs
(about 2 weeks); you will not be charged until then either.  Only six pair
are available, so they'll be alocated based on who orders first.

Finally, I also have N.O.S. German Volkswagen right-side '68-71 heat
exchangers for $99.95 (part number 043 255 108HG).  While left side is not
available in German, I do have the heavy-duty Dansk ones at $20 off, for
$79.95 (043 255 107H), to make up a pair.  Both are in stock and on the
website.

As always, busdepot_dot_com, or toll-free 1-866-BUS-DEPOT for orders by part
number only.
