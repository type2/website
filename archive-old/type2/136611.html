Subject: clutch scrape?

I finished pulling the interior of my '72 Westy on Sunday. I cleaned
the steel flooring with soapy water and rags (now that was fun). I
figured that the ride would be considerably louder now that the
carpeting and all wasn't there. Once the engine is warm, it really
isn't that much louder. Instead, there's kind of a metalic scraping
sound when I clutch. I don't know how to better describe it, but it
doesn't sound like a good thing - like _lots_ of ball bearings rolling
on a metal sheet. The clutch operates as always: reliable engagement,
doesn't pop out of gear. It doesn't make this noise going into 1st from
dead stop / nuetral / 2nd or from 1st to 2nd. If the RPM's are low,
there's no noise from 3rd down to 2nd or from 4th down to 3rd. Shifting
from 2nd to 3rd and 3rd to 4th, though, are when that noise shows up
(higher RPM's, I figured).
I was going to focus on rust repair, sound deadening, interior install,
but I wanted to check in on this noise first. I need to know what's
causing the noise, and how serious it is. Need I gear up for an engine
pull / tranny replacement or is this no big deal and its loud because I
pulled all the sound deadening stuff and its usually loud &lt;-yeah, I
figured this wasn't it, but there's no harm in hoping :)
As always, this list has always been a great resource. I didn't look in
the archive because, quite honestly, I didn't know what to ask for.
Thanks!
