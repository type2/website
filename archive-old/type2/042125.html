Subject: Fair warning!  George is on the road!

Heading out tomorrow from my home in SoCal to points north.  General plan
is to spend the 4th at my Dad's house in N. Nevada, then to head toward
Glacier Park.  We'll probably be on the road for three weeks or so.  Lots
of room for leeway in this plan!

So, if you live in N. Cal, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana,
or thereabouts and would like to have the Lyle's drop by for a visit send
me a pmail and we'll see what works out.  We had a great time seeing a few
listees last year and would like to do the same again this year.

We're generally doing the same thing this year as last, but in a new
(to us) region.  For some reason the Pacific Northwest hasn't seen out
wheels for some time!  We'll put in a few miles each day and generally let
our noses guide us.  The girls (2nd and 4th grade) are learning how to
read maps and navigate,
so this should provide some interesting side trips!

If you see the white-over-green '71 with the antenna farm on the luggage
rack, give a wave!

George Lyle
