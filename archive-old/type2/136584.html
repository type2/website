Subject: sheared off cam gear kills engine?

Re:

&gt;Here's what killed me engine:

&gt;http://www.ocotillofield_dot_net/oldcam.jpg

&gt;What could cause this?

I have taken apart a lot of blown engines. Most died because of valve
problems, fewer died because of worn out rod bearings. I have never seen a
camshaft gear sheared off the camshaft. I suspect you had other valve train
problems that stopped the camshaft from turning; like really stuck lifters
from low oil pressure and galled lifter channels; or sticking valves.

I sure am interested to know what conditions caused this. You need to really
inspect and spec all the valve train components.

Bye

Gary
