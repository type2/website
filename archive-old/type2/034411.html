  Isiah,
  Since diesel burns slower than gasoline there will be no damage to your 
engine. Just clean it all out and change the oil. Gasoline in a diesel is 
much worse.
  As for a diesel engine in a type2 I believe crown makes a Kit to bolt up a 
rabbit diesel or gas engine in a type2 However a friend of mine did the 
rabbit diesel swap with a rebuilt engine. The result was less power due to 
gearing etc. and he ended tearing it all out and putting in a gas Rabbit 
engine.
  Live well,
  Pat Price
  PS if  your freezing you need warmer clothes. or dod what I do and leave 
minnesota for the winter.
