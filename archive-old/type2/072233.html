Good luck!!

This a very time consuming and expensive project to do it correctly.  You
would be many hours, dollars and headaches ahead if you just sold the
Vanagon and bought a type 4 engine.


&gt;I have a 1980 Vanagon engine I'd like to install a in my 1979 Westy.
&gt;
&gt;Questions I have are,  Can this easily be done? Are there any problems or
&gt;things I should look out for?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
