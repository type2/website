&gt; VW WESTFALIA CAMPER 84, 63K, great shape but needs motor work, best offer.
&gt; (203) 389-6522. New Haven


I called on this one a month ago. Owner says engine broke when his son
drove it. Was fine before. Now engine turns over, but won't catch.
He's second owner. I asked what he was hoping for, and he said $5k.
Too much for a broken bus, but maybe by now he's come down. 
The westy is actually at his brother somewhere north of New Haven so 
I didn't get to see it.
