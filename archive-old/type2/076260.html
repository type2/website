Subject: RE: [T2] Carburetor Icing (was: FI vs. Progressive carb)

Another fix for progressive carb icing is a modified heating element from
Jake Raby (I think). I have the progressive carb and have decided to try
this option. It is basically a regular working preheating element that is
modified for the progressive carb. I am not sure what it sells for, but when
I checked over the summer they were $80. I plan on purchasing one of these
after the first of the year. I will keep the list posted on the performance
of this type of solution.

Carburetor Icing has been addressed by GM for years by preheating the
intake manifolds, I recall heated intakes on Mercedes 190SL intake
manifold and my MG Midget and although I cannot be specific I believe
that I've seen aluminum spacer blocks for a variety of SU, AMAL and
Weber. These spacer blocks can be heated by water flow, exhaust gasses or
just a copper tube wrapped around something hot that can cause convection
air flow. You'd be surprised how effective a set of double gaskets can be
in changing the temperature of your throttle body. In days of old 40
Fords we simply taped the heater hose to the fuel line and it preheated
the fuel enough to solve the problem. Your fix may be that simple.
