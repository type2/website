&gt;Hi David,
&gt;
&gt;Did you have a chance to check out your Freeze 12 on a
&gt;real hot day?  I hope it's still working for you.  I
&gt;can't seem to keep some of the blends I tried in my
&gt;old cars cooling for more than a couple weeks.

Rick Taylor and I have been discussing this offline.  There is some info at
http://www.freeze-12_dot_com and also some links that Rick sent me:

&gt;&gt; http://www.aircondition_dot_com/wwwboard/alternative/current/6303.html
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is the AutoFrost web site, check out the Alternative Refrigerant
&gt;&gt; Mineral Oil Miscibilities page, it really shows a lot:
&gt;&gt; http://www.autofrost_dot_com/

Bottom line is that I've had the Freeze-12 in the Mustang (which is a
mineral-oil-lubricated system that previously had R-12) for a couple of
months now with no problems, and in fact it cools at least as well as it
did with the original R-12.  Time will tell if the compressor will fail
because of oil starvation but I'm not worried about it.

The 134a in my bus cools fairly well but I think the Freeze-12 might do
better so I'm going to try it.  The bus has ester lubricant so it shouldn't
suffer from the possible compressor-starvation problems that some people
are worried about.  If it doesn't work out I can just switch back to 134a
for the cost of a couple cans of refrigerant.
