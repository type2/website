&gt;The best door to body seals I have seen are the West Coast Metric
&gt;ones.  The profiles are pretty correct, but the color is wrong.
&gt;The Wolfsburg West front door to body seals I got a year or two

The other problem with this stuff is its way too stiff.  The 40-something
year-old rubber on my barndoor is much more supple.
