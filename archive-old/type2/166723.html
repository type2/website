Subject: Re: [T2] i got a call back from sirius radio and i gave them my
  demands

I'm confused.  Is this a hostage situation or are you negotiating a  
contract?

Maybe using the word &quot;terms&quot; or &quot;conditions&quot; rather than &quot;demands&quot;  
would make for a less tense sounding situation.

Cheers,

Duke
