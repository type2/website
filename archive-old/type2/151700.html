Subject: Re: [T2] Appraisal for 78 Westy

Ned,

I used these folks last year for two of my VW's...bus and another car.

http://www.i-van_dot_org/

email or call and see if they have an appraiser in your area.

Cost is not especially cheap, but I thought very reasonable.

The person that comes out may not know VW's well, but they will research 
it thru their network and let you know.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know where I can get an appraisal for insurance for a 78 
&gt; Westy? Original paint, some small rust spots, engine with 10k miles on 
&gt; it from Boston Engine.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
