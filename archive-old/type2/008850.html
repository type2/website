&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; &gt;   I am selling my 1970 Bus with a westy pop-top and Z-bed. It has a
&gt; &gt; 1600dp with about 30k miles on rebuild, doghouse cooler,
&gt; Alternator,
&gt; &gt; heater assist blower. This Bus is nice but needs paint and a little
&gt; &gt; TLC. It is currently used as my daily driver, so it runs great and
&gt; &gt; everything works. I have too many prodjects and one has to go. I am
&gt; &gt; asking $1000 but will take any resonable offer, please drop me a
&gt; line I
&gt; &gt; want this to go to a good home it has a lot of potential.
