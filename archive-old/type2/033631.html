Subject: The Infamous CV Joint

Volks,

First - I checked the archives (well, the first couple pages of my search
result) without answers, so here goes:

I am in the process of inspecting my CVs/swing-axle joints and replacing the
boots which were all quite torn and ragged.  My only source of inspiration
is Muir and Idiot Luck.  Petunia (78 Westy) has the new boots which required
removing the axle so I can pull the boot assembly off.  Unfortunately, once
I had the first axle in my hands, and had removed the balls and outer ring,
I GOT NO FURTHER.  Muir says the cage should come right off, allowing me to
remove the boot and it's ring.  No joy.  After 30mins of stupefied effort, I
concluded that damned cage isn't coming off.  It sits real pretty on the
axle, though.

What gives?

Thanks all.

Justin
