Subject: Re: [T2] Routing gas heater into stock heating system

Gasoline heaters work a lot off of volume of air, but not a lot of pressure.
The stock system uses pressure to push the heat through the long heat
passages.  You would be reducing the amount of heat your gas heater puts out
by a great amount. 

I'm sure I read somewhere that at the engine the stock system puts out a lot
more BTU than a gas heater, but because of distance and leaks by the time
the heat gets all the way to the front, there isn't much left.  Gas heaters
worked so well because the heater was put where the heat was needed without
the need for ducts.  SouthWind even had a model that went under the parcel
tray on the splitty busses that put the heat directly on your feet, no loss
of heat with this unit.

&gt; Has anyone ever routed their gas heater into the stock heating system?  I'm
&gt; wondering what the pro's and con's are in doing something like this.  If
&gt; this was done, how would one block off the heater boxes?  Would the defrost
&gt; work better?
