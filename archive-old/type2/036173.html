&gt;I have a question: Why do people call the 73 bus engine a 1700 when the mag. 
&gt;indicates it is 1795cc?  If rounding is use then it would be more accurate  
&gt;to call it a 1800. 

Consider the source.  Would you trust VWTrends magazine or the
Robert Bentley shop manual for the correct information?

The Bentley manual says that engine codes CB and CD have a
displacement of 1679cc.  Get a good shop manual, your bus will
love you for it.  :-)
