I would like to hear from others who have ordered from Bus Depot about how
long it took to receive their order.

I ordered a new canvas and seals 11 days ago and have not received anything
as of yet.  Am I just being impatient or should I be concerned?

They have great prices and I have read many good reports, and would like to
order from them again, just want to make sure there is no problem.

Thanks,
