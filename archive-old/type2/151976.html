&gt; I recently enjoyed toasty heat from a stock heater in a bus in very

&gt; &gt; if you can find an Eberspacher grab it....no matter how good you get that
&gt; &gt; old heat, it is never toasty, it just keeps you from freezing to death...

ok I drive a heater a little harder than average I guess too, I ski and
when you fire up the bus at negative temps and blowing wind you want heat
NOW.. especially after a day on the slopes...I also have a seat heater
too.   (also why I have twin batteries and synthetic lubes)
