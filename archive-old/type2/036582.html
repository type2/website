&gt; question:  Did you use the 1973 or the 1980 alternator/shroud set-up?

All accesories, tin and the fan shroud were from the '73. We treated the
Vanagon engine as a &quot;long block&quot; with the exception of the dipstick (the
engine now has 2, ideal for a dipstick oil temp sending unit! :-) I don't
think it is possible without major fabrication to use Vanagon tin or the
Vanagon shroud in the bay.

&gt;            Was the final motor hydraulic/fuel injected? 

Fuel injected ('78 system) 

&gt;            Was computer compatability an issue?

Nope.  As long as the whole FI system is present and for the correct
size motor, it does not care.

&gt;            One year later, how is that motor permutation doing? 

Not good... dropped valve, I think, but that has nothing to do with the
transplant, and much to do with the AVP heads which had been cruelly
mistreated by the GEX rocker shaft supports (long story)

&gt;            Is it a stopgap, or is it a viable motor?

Very viable motor.  The engine's current problems have nothing to do with
the transplant.  If you have a good Vanagon block, I would not hesitate to
put it in a bus body.  I would advise boring out the holes in the rear
support and using the larger bolts from the Vanagon.  VW must have found
that the engine needed the larger bolts as the years passed, so I would
stick with them.
