Subject: Re: Dual battery wiring

oops, I'm not getting a gel cell - rather it's a
Lifeline AGM, which supposedly can safely handle a
higher current level.

from the website &quot;Safety - even during severe
overcharge the LIFELINE AGM battery produces less than
2% hydrogen gas (4.1% is required for flammability in
air)&quot;

so.. maybe it can handle a somewhat thicker gauge?
