&gt; Volks: I had a engine fire in my 76 Type II. Anyone know
&gt;       if the distributor from a 79 Type II is compatible.
&gt;      The vacuum advance unit looks quite different.

I know that the vacuum cannisters come in many forms, they are
calibrated in a way, a friend of mine replaced one on his 1700
411 and experienced flat spots just off idle, after some asking
around he was told to replace the cannister with the correct 
number for his car and the car ran fine again...
