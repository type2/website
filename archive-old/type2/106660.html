Subject: Re: [T2] Run Marty, it's the Iraqis...I don't know how they 
  found me!!!

&gt; &gt; Heh, anyone remember in Back to the Future - Part 1, the Iraqis came after
&gt; &gt; the Doc because he had stolen plutonium from them? They found him in the
&gt; &gt; parking lot of JC Penny's and they were chasing after him with a moon-roof
&gt; &gt; Volkswagen &quot;Bay Window&quot; Bus. The guy was sticking out the top with a rocket
&gt; &gt; launcher
&gt;
&gt; Just for the record It was the Libyans.

The MDPH has officially changed the Back to the Future terrorists to be
Iraqis. They have always been Iraqi. That is all.
