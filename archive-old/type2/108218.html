Subject: Re: [T2] Zbed from Zproducts availability

Hi Martin --

About a year ago I pursued the Z Products Z-Bed, and got the same
non-response from the company that you did. They even sounded annoyed when I
called and asked them to put me on a waiting list -- they really didn't want
to start and keep such a list. (This is what a friend of mine calls &quot;being
in business in spite of yourself.&quot;) Don't hold your breath...

I posted the item on the lists here, hoping other individuals would want one
and that our friendly vendors active on the list might each order a few for
inventory, reaching the required batch quantity of 30 that Z Products
mentioned to me. About 8 people let me know that they too subsequently
called Z Products to express their interest. Nothing came of it.

By the way, everyone, this is not the same as a camper &quot;Z-bed.&quot; this product
uses a regular bus back seat (and its seat back) to convert into the bed
surface, so one can have a stock-looking non-camper and still have a bed in
the bus. (Think &quot;stealth camper.&quot;) It consists of a bunch of bracketry that
attaches to the seat framing to hinge it upward and forward into a level-bed
position.

I'm still anxious to get a Z-bed kit of this type. Anyone have one spare???

&gt;Hi, after searching the archives on the Type2 list I saw your message re:
the zbed kit from oregon. Any luck in getting them tooling up for a new
production run? I've been calling them over the last couple of years without
success. I just emailed them today, as they show them on their web site
still. Hope to hear from you soon. cheers, martin.
