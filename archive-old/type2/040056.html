Subject: Jumper-cables and charging????

Hi All,
In my fuel injected 1977 westy I have installed a second battery.  Muir
states in his book in bold writing that I should not use jumper cables to
start my fuel injected engine.  It also says that I need to pull the battery
out of the bus before slow or quick charging it to reduce the risk of
ruining the fuel injection control unit.

My question is:

My westy has a built in timer for a battery charger and supposedly I can
just plug the city power in and charge the battery but the Westfalia owners
manual says I can leave the battery in the car as long as I open the engine
hatch for ventilation.  Is Muir in the wrong on this one?  I know much of
what he says is well out of date but I want a second opinion.  What is the
most effective way to charge my battery and if they do need to be jumped,
can I use cables?

Thanks in advance.  You can't imagine how helpful you guys (gals) are to me.
Dave
