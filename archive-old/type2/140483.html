Subject: Re: [T2] Alternator hook-up

I think Karl has it.   Also Bart, when you do find the bug regulator and 
it's associated harness, and hook it up to the alternator, you have to check 
the voltage output. Those regs do go bad, I've tested a bunch of them, and 
they have ranged from no output at all from the alt to way too much.
With the regulator screwed down to the body(grounded) and the engine revved 
up, the output from the big terminal should be about 14 volts. If not try to 
find a new Bosch regulator and retest.
There are brushes in there under that white ceramic section that can wear 
out, but the reg is the brain of the outfit without which you don't have 
much.

&lt;From Bart Massaer:

 I replaced recently the generator of our bay-window bus (1969) with an
alternator I got from the previous owner.
I now wonder about the correct hook-up of the wires. I have this thick red 
wire connected to B+, the green
wire connected to DF... is this OK? I
suppose the brown wire is ground, should I connect it to D-? And leave D+ 
alone?

 I wanted to be sure before starting the engine...

It sounds like you have a mid 70's bug Motorola alternator.

Does it have a odd shaped M in a circle on the edge near the pulley?
Does it have a white ceramic section on top held down with four screws with 
3 terminals in the middle that
resembles the back of a headlight?

If you answered YES to both of those questions...... you HAVE to find the 
bug that alternator came of and get
the voltage regulator under the left side of the rear seat and the harness 
between it and the alternator.&gt;
