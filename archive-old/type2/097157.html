Subject: EMISSION REPAIRS?

Hey peoples,

I have a 72 van and I just had it tested at the emissions place.
I have failed the test and have 3 months to fix it up.
Any pointers to fix her up so she can pass?
I know that I need to adjust the timing , change the oil and filter,
put new spark plugs in . i have the dual carbs so i'm thinking that they may
need to be
rebuilt.is there anything else that i may be forgetting?
Thanks
your help is much appreciated.
Darren
