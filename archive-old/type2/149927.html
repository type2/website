Subject: Electrical mystery

I *could* get the alternator retested, but I'm afraid to start the car.
I don't want to melt the wire harness again.

Whatever the problem is, could we be getting to the root cause of what
melted the wire in the first place?

I'll go try the fuses.  I have Ratwell's fusebox layout.  The numbers are
assigned to the fuses left to right, right?

Thanks--
