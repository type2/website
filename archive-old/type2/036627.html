Subject: Stabilizer (anti-sway) clamps

Hi List friends,
                           As you all may know, the stabilizer (or anti-sway
bar) couples the left and right lower front torsion arms.  On my 69
Baywindow, the bar fastens at two places on each torsion arm: with a bolt at
the end and a rubber collar near the shock mount.  The rubber collar is held
on the torsion arm by a 2-piece band/clamp of heavy sheet metal.  [R+R on
p.101 of the 1970 VW AG Service Manual; not covered explicitly in Bentley
68-74, but visible in sect. 2 fig. 6-3.]

Can someone give me the part numbers for the band/clamp?  Or even better,
tell me where I can buy new ones?   Mine are cancered through....

Thanks
Glenn.....  Queenstown, MD
