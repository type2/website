Subject: throttle cable: split = loaf ?

Hi,

Does anyone know if, by chance, the throttle cable for a 78 bus is the same
as that of a 62 split window. An NOS cable just turned up in my storage area
and I no longer have the 62. If it fits my 78 I will hang on to it.
Otherwise I will get rid of it.

Bob
