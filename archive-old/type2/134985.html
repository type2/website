Subject: RE: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

&gt; *three* rebuilt-by-Bosch generators failed within
&gt; about half a year.  One one had a bearing failure
&gt; after 2-3 months, one failed a day after installation
&gt; with some kind of an electrical defect, and one
&gt; stopped charging after a month or so of driving.


I don't think I've taken back 3 Bosch generators in the last three years
combined. I can't say why this might have happened to you (perhaps something
unique about your bus, your generator pulley, or whatever; or maybe
amazingly bad luck), but it's certainly far from typical.
