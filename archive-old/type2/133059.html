Subject: more on Koln tent.._dot_used it!

Folks,

Well, the local club had their annual campout this weekend and I had
an opportunity to actually use my new tent.

I am happy to report that the air mattress I bought fit inside the
&quot;bedroom&quot; perfectly and that my wife and I slept in *very* comfortably(I 
am 6&quot;4&quot;).

I have two tips for those that have not put it up at an actual camp site 
and used it.

1:  Once you stake the side that matches up to the bus, be aware that 
opening the sliding door can catch the top of the flap that connects
the bus to the rest of the tent...I tore mine a little by not paying 
attention to this.

2:  The &quot;wing&quot; clamp gadgets need to be tilted up toward the roof as
far as possible as the threaded part that hangs down can catch the sliding 
door(I didn't do this).  The one that goes toward the front of bus *will* 
catch the front door if you open it(I didn't do this either).

What needs to be done is to take the clamps apart and set them up so that 
the threaded part of the clamp sticks *up* rather than down.  This is a 
problem on the center one as it can then tear the top of the tent flap....

I'm thinking that I will just cut a lot of the threaded part off of each 
of them and then be safe.

Otherwise, the only problem I had was how to fold the tent back up 
properly to get it back in the bag!...wish we had instructions on 
that!...Ron?

Everyone that saw it was very impressed(me too!) and wanted to know where 
I got it...I told them...good ole busdepot!&lt;grin&gt;


Cheers, dave
