Subject: Power Brakes?

Hey guys,

	The previous owner of my Bus said that the brakes used to have power
assist, but when he installed the new motor, he no longer had power assist.
Do the brakes have a brake booster? Is it vacuum assisted? I assume I can
just hook it right up to the carburetor, right?


Thanks!
