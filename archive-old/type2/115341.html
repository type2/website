Subject: AFM gate

On a '78 2.0 FI USA Federal model: (standard trans)

(1) Does the AFM gate have to touch the base to get the reading that 
measures the air flow thru the AFM??  When i take the AFM off, and put into 
the light, I am seeing light coming through the bottom edge of the AFM gate, 
like if a door was closed and you could see the light from the other room at 
the bottom of the door.

(2) I am having an endemic problem with stalling.  And I had a massive 
amount of blow by recently, as a result of hitting 70 MPH at some points.  
Oil came from the oil breather into the Air Intake Elbow Boot, and probably 
back to the AFM gate.  This has happened before.

Could a bunch of oil settling on the AFM gate base plate cause an air flow 
misreading such that the ECU thought a lot of air was coming through and 
shot the FIs to make too an over rich mixture that causes stalling??  (after 
stall, it acts like a carb engine that was flooded.  Starts in 1 sec when 
stone cold, but take 7 secs of turning engine to get it to catch after 
stall.  then I have to pump that accel to get it to higher revs. Stalls even 
in gear!!)


(3) I plan to clean the AFM plate with starting fluid.  Is this OK??  Will 
the ether hurt the plate??  (I was looking for a vacuum leak, and when I 
sprayed the ether over some of the oil that came from my oil breather blow 
by, the oil on the oil breather and engine seemed to dissolve.  It 
disappeared.)

Engine is suddenly running super cool, and suddenly the gas mileage is down. 
  Rich mixture.
50 dwell and 7.5 BTDC, and 15&quot; vacuum at 1000 RPM cold start.
RPMs drop to 800 as engine warms up - 60 seconds.
Hydraulic lifters, no chatter when cold.
Throttle cleaned and sealed.
'New' Fuel Injectors.
'New' intake boots.
New gas filter.
No vacuum leak detected with ether in the engine compartment (experienced on 
this, I am)
and brake booster vacuum tested OK by &quot;assistant&quot;.
New points (1000 miles) and new condenser; replaced rotor and cap and 
ignition wires with good set.  Backup coil installed.
Compression excellent (125 - 125 - 135 - 140).
Oil consumption only when driving past 60 MPH due to blow by.

Damn thing sounds so good that this morning I had to coast up to a gas pump 
for a fillup because I thought I stalled and approach.  Even after I was 
stopped at the gas pump, I had to touch my gas pedal to see if the engine 
was running or not.  Yes, I know, if the engine is not turning over and the 
ignition is still on, the oil light will come on.  But I still couldn't 
believe that my engine was running, it was so quiet.

Thanks
