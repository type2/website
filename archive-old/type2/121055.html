Subject: Which carb?

Hello,

My 72 van has the weber carb on it. what I found is that the little rubber
boots that are
on the intake manifolds are prone to crack and cause a vacuum leak which
affects
the performance. the intake part that is just underneath the air filter
should be connected
to the crankcase breather and the brake booster is attached to the base of
the carb, below
the intake manifold. is the timing set correctly? before setting the timing,
loosen the clamps
on the rubber boots and see if they are cracked.
let me know.
darren
