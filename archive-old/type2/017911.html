   Which tools? As many as you can pack along. My tool box is a biggie
-- just fits between the icebox and rear-facing seat in my '73 Westy.
And I also have a floor jack under the rear seat, a dremel tool with
flex extension, etc. Don't really carry much in spare parts, but have a
grease gun and grease needle, some blocks of wood for extra jack height
and emergency wheel blocks. Also a plastic tarp to lie on if the ground
is wet, also serves as a awning. Different size wire and wire
connections, tape, etc. A digital mulitmeter and timing light (although
the latter isn't really needed on the road -- I just keep it in the big
toolbox, along with the torque wrench which I hope I don't need).
