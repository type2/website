Subject: Re: How many solenoids..

Lots is the answer!! It also varies depending on the year and accessories 
fitted.
Relays are also a solenoid don't forget, so that includes things like 
high/low beam relay, heater fan relay, starter motor, dual battery, idle cut 
off, idle jets etc, etc....
And if your like me heaps more than original for things light head lights, 
fog lights, spot lights, aux fuel pump....
Regards,
Richard  :-)
