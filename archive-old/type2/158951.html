Subject: Re: Spark Plugs

The R, as Karl and George say, is for Resistor, which helps to suppress
ignition noise so your radio picks up less static.  This may not matter
when the engine is in the rear, and your radio is up front, but it
doesn't affect the plug's performance either way (according to NGK's UK
website).

The NGK B5ES is supposed to be equivalent to W8CC so reach should be the
same.

I'd stay away from platinums for our old archaic ignition and fuel
systems.  I personally have had trouble with fouling probably because
our engines are not able to regulate fuel as well as modern FI systems can.

&gt; And the R comes after the B:  BR5ES

The B is the thread size (14mm), R is resistor, P is projected tip, 5 is
heat range (lower is hotter), E is the thread reach (E=3/4 inch long

reach, H=1/2 inch short reach) and S is a standard electrode.

The plug that comes in mexican engines with long reach heads is a BP5ES.
I think that the correct plug for short reach applications is B5HS.  A
BP5HS would also work well.
&gt;
Pay attention to the reach!  You don't want to put a put a short plug in a
long head or vise versa!
