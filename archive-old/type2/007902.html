Subject: VW-'71 Bus-WEIRD VACC LEAK FROM SERVO?
Message-Id: &lt;199811291824.KAA01009_at_judge.rand_dot_org&gt;

(apologies if you've already seen this message)

I whined last week that my '71 Bus was experiencing a noticable loss of
power on hills (not the jerky kind of loss from fuel starvation but a much
smoother drop).  Because the problem manifested itself primarily on
inclines, and because I would hear a satisfying &quot;whoosh&quot; when I
disconnected the line to the brake server from the backfire check valve
when the engine was off (thus insuring that the lines from the valve to
the server could hold a serious vaccum), I suspected a variety of culprits
including bad coil, bad carb, bad wires, bad plugs, bad dizzy. and bad
accell cable setting.  Alas, the problem was not fixed even when the
suspect parts were replaced or swapped and has indeed gotten worse.  It
now will intermittently exhibit reduction of power on the flats (though
not all the time).  I noticed that the problem seemed to be accompanied by
a slight stiffening of the brake pedal (though no noticable reduction in
braking) This could mean vacc loss though spraying starting fluid doesn't
have any effect at the usual points of sleeves and connectors (except whem
sprayed at the right side of the carb,,,,hmmmm?).  For a lark, I inverted
the backfire valve so that the servo was cut off from the manifold.  Guess
what?  Thing ran like a champ and zipped up a hill in 4th where previously
it was straining in 3rd.

Now this might be a cowinkydink and the problem might still be an
intermittently sticking valve or some other horror but for the moment,
assume the servo is at fault in some weird way. The Booster lines are fine
(see, e.g. the &quot;whoosh&quot; test even when the Bus is running like shit) but
could there be something internal to the servo that could occasionally
result in enough leakage to make the bus run bad (though not choking and
near death like a complete and open leak)?  Could this still provide
braking assistance though allowing enough air into the manifold to make
the Bus act like it was running on 3 pistons?  The problem is that I have
coated the servo with starting fluid like holy water yet don't hear any
RPM changes.  Again, I might be doing it at the wrong time but I don't
think so.

I took a look at the servo and found an unexplained air hose (I suppose)
running out of the front piece.  Could the leak be somewhere else other
than at the servo or in the booster vacc lines?  Where does this hose go
and what does it do?

Inquiring minds want to know.


Thanks,

Nick
