Having trouble with the sliding door on a '70 Westy.While sitting in a garage
the door became stuck. I find I can open the door if I pull on the handle as
hard as I can, which I am hesitant to do on a regular basis.When closing the
door pulling up on the handle pulls in the rear of the door like it should ,
just won't open easily. Any suggestions?

Jeff
