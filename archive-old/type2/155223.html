Subject: Re: [T2] CIP1

Despite having to go through the US site, they still shipped from
Burnaby, which meant no duty, no brokerage fees and orders arriving
within a couple of days of being ordered, even with cheap shipping.

They stopped publishing a CDN dollar catalog a few years ago when the
CDN dollar was fluctuating so much compared to the US dollar.  I also
seem to remember ordering stuff from them before they had a website.
I can't remember if they had a US outlet at the time - the name
California Import Parts made even more sense then.

&gt; They uses to have a Canadian catalog IIRC. Then they made customers go to
the US site, shop in USD and then pay the converted total. Prices seem to be
on par with the exchange rate...
