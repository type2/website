Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley manual for '73

&gt; &gt; Being as how the best shop in my city has no Bentley
&gt; &gt; manual for T2, and wants a ridiculous price to import one,
&gt; &gt; I suppose I should chance my credit card details to the
&gt; &gt; Mass. publisher. for a '73, the nearest I can find on their
&gt; &gt; website is a '74, viz.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; http://www.bentleypublishers_dot_com/product.htm?code=r274
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       Or am I overlooking a better item?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; No, that's an owners manual. Here's the one you need. We are an authorized
&gt; Bentley distributor, but we discount their titles, and we ship to New
&gt; Zealand regularly.

I got mine from Amazon for about $20 with $3 for shipping.

Their out there.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
