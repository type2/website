Subject: Re: [T2] Stock Exhaust choices

Never been a fan of the Dansk muffler - alignment is poor and the paint job
they give 'em is just downright horrible.

Ernst is a much better muffler (that's all we [Airhead] sell)

Leistritz was another maker I used a lot in the 70s thru the 90s and I
recall they were of excellent manufacture and fit perfectly.  But it looks
as if they've gone the way of the &quot;Dodo Bird&quot;.

&gt; Currently there are only two manufacturers for stock 68-71 exhaust
&gt; systems;
&gt; Dansk and Ernst
&gt; Which is better Ernst or Dansk?
&gt; The Dansk muffler I put on this '70 isn't even close to bolting up right.
&gt; It
&gt; &quot;works&quot; for now but I don't want to buy a Ernst and find the same
&gt; alignment
&gt; problems.
