&gt;.Is it the starter/solenoid you guys?  I'm frustrated as hell cause I can't
&gt;nail it down!

Wade...
I had a similar problem with my '70 when I first got her on the road.   I
pulled the starter/solenoid cleaned all the connections with a wire brush
and WD 40, paying special attention to the ground strap from the starter to
the frame.  I also installed the hot start relay at the same time.

When I had the starter out I checked the solenoid by running some jumper
cables from the battery to the + and body of the starter. (this is likely
NOT the best way to test it but I quickly found out that it worked).

To prevent the corrosion from happening again, I gave all connections a nice
coating of Dilithium Grease which repels water while promoting conductivity.

All this may seem like alot of work, but for the price of an afternoon, she
now cranks with the power of a thousand bulls.
Let us know how it goes.
