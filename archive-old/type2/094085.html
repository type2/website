Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Filter Folly?

&gt; All this talk about fuel filters has got me wondering.  How often SHOULD you
&gt; change the fuel filter on a fuel-injected bus?
&gt; 
&gt; I put the FI system on my 73 nearly 20,000 miles/3 years ago and have never
&gt; changed the filter.  On my 74 914 with FI, I've been running the same filter
&gt; for 35,000 miles/4 years.  I know both of my gas tanks are good and clean and
&gt; I'm not experiencing any problems, but am I asking for trouble?

The Bentley and my partially stamped maintenance book says every 15,000
miles.
