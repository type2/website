hey, looks like you got a good project.  love those air scoops.  i never
have figured out why people think they work.  lets see, i have about 12x14
inches of area to let air in.  no wait...lets block it off and make it into
a *scoop*, it will be cooler looking and *scoops* in more air.  huh huh
uh...now we have only a 1x12 inch opening of surface area to let the air in.
but wait, it HAS to work better, i bought it at the vw *performance* shop
and it was marked *bugpack, empi,(fit in appropriate name here)*......

thats all just a little commentary....

&gt;  
&gt;  its pretty bare bones, but i plan to fix it up snazzy in the future.
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  take care,
&gt;
