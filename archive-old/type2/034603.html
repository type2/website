Subject: noise acceleration

Dear volks,
I am driving with 1.6L standard air cooled engine, a few weeks ago I had
done preventive maintenance at valve clearance set up and engine tune up.
Before that I feel some noise at valve parts, I already replaced valve
bushing and valve it self with a new one, replaced valve swivel with heavy
duty type ( used ball tip ), centering valve swivel into valves, set
clearance 0.15 mm.  However when engine turn on small noise still coming (
Identification from caps of rocker arm ), besides that when I accelerate my
bus noise will become high and will disappear after steady condition, I am
worry the engine will be broken,....
Did you have any suggestion / advice to me, and what kind inspection must I
done ????

Regards,
Thomas
