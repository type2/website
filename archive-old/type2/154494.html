Non A/C Type IV motors have a thick washer to replace the A/C pulley.  I
know cuz I just put the pulley on my 2 l. !

&gt; The bus originally had air conditioning installed.  PO removed it (and
&gt; the compressor)  There was the small pulley rattling around behind the
&gt; cooling fan.  Because I don't have an AC system to install, I plan to
&gt; remove that pulley and keep it in the &quot;spare parts&quot; bin.  Do I need to
&gt; shim anything? (doesn't look like I have to, but I want to make sure)

Ummm... Not sure on this one, but I think there is a shim on mine in
place of the pully... but can't remember.  I'd just leave it there.
