Subject: Engine options

I'm with John. I'm now considering dropping a 2L in my 73. It's a straight
swap, right? I'm sticking with my dual Solex setup. I'm looking into AVP.
Are the cylinder heads extra, or do they come with the engine?

The price I got quoted for a local 1700 rebuild was comparable to what I'd
pay for an AVP 2L. So what the hey? Might as well go for it, if the
shipping's not outrageous.

Am I expected to use my old 1700 fan housing, or do I need to find one, or
do I get one with the new engine? My old one's all funky, but to my
surprise the number matches that on the engine.

Nikki
