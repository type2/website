Subject: Re: Bus interior conversion

&gt; I was just wondering...is it possible to convert a regular bus
&gt; into a westy.


The parts are not available new, but you can transfer the parts from an old
Westy without too much difficulty. With the exception of the poptop,
everything basically bolts on. I often sell interiors to people who are
planning to do just that.

For those who are interested, I do have the interior from a '78 Deluxe
Westy for sale, just for such a purpose.  This includes a sofabed, sink,
fridge, dual battery control panel, propane stove and tank, and related
cabinets and trim.  This is the later style, with all of the cabinets
behind the drivers seat (generally considered the nicest Westy bus layout).
Would bolt into a '68-79 bus.  Price is $375 complete. I also have the
poptop for $100 (poptop good, canvas bad). I also have some cabinets,
sofabeds, etc. available separately, as well as a pair of really nice green
plaid front seats from a '76-79, various front curtains, and  some plaid
Westy fabric for recovering seats.  Sorry, no tables or trash recepticle. 
Cannot ship the camper interior or poptop; you remove here in Pa.
