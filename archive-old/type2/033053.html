Subject: Got oil pressure!

Hey y'all
Been working diligently on the Dor for a while now, mostly stopping rust
because I've had the weather to do it.  Got almost all the parts in for
the brake job, missing 1 rear hose (is it in yet Ronnie?) then I use a
lift and brake lathe for a day.

I got a wild hair a few days ago and decided to see if it'd go.  Not
knowing much of it's history I decided to do the slow cautious route.
First, check valve settings and head torque.  Heads were loose, valves
were tight and #1 exhaust was stuck.  A couple loving taps with a BFH
loosened the valve up.  Set valves to .004/.006 {AE case with doghouse
cooler - how cool is that huh?}.  Clean electrical connections, new
battery &amp; terminals (the disconnect kind).  Top off the battery with
charge.  Disconnect coil wires and turn the key.  Crank 5 seconds wait
30 seconds.  After 4 such tries the oil light started winking instead of
steady on.  2 more tries and it went off.  Way cool.  Now i'm gonna hook
the wires back up and see if I can make a hell of a racket (header's
rotted to hell'n gone).

Sorry if this rambled but I'm excited - feel like Gene Wilder in Young
Frankenstein IT'S ALIVE!!!!!

Back to wrenching and makin' punkin pie - hell of a combo huh?

Dave
