I'll jump in on the noisy campground issue. All that electric noise IS a
PITA, but it's not how it has to be.  Canadian Provincial Parks, only 2
hours from my home here in Michigan, commonly have quiet zones with no
radios, TVs, etc for RV folk.  It's great, doesn't cost anything more.  I
recommend every American visit Canada regularly for a reminder of what
widespread courtesy is like.  They have their bad days like we do here, but
across the board, their campgrounds areas are cleaner and quieter on
average.  I don't think there's any call for artificial entertainment in
campgrounds that anyone outside of your own space can see or hear.  TV
addicts won't understand.
