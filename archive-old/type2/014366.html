Subject: Sandwich oil cooler adapter question

I just finally got around to installing the axillary oil cooler on my  83
Westfalia Air Cooled.
I installed the additional cooler by using an Empi sandwich type adapter
that goes between the oil filter and the original filter mount.
I've got a question: 
I noticed that the sandwich adapter and the original oil filter mount
both have check valves in them. Does this dual check valve scenario
present any problems?.
Seems to me that they would hardly ever even get into sync except at high
pressure.
