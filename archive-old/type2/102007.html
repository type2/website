&gt; Aren't we talking about two different adjustments?

The idle mixture screw is #1.  It's under the blue cap (if you have one) in
this picture:

BTW, the cap is still available from the VW dealer although it's hard to
remove once it's popped in.

&gt; Whoa- I thought that the external screw adjustment on the AFM only

True.

&gt; You imply it can affect the mix during normal running?
&gt; My mechanic also adjusts the AFM mix by going to lean until it stumbles, then
&gt; back in to
&gt; first smooth idle.

This is why a CO meter works best.
