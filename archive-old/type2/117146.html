&quot;That's way more interesting than the 2005 Microbus.&quot;

Speaking of which has anyone taken a closer look. The pictures I have seen
show 2 oddities.

1. The Fuel filler looks like it is on the drivers side? or is ther eone on
the passenger side too?
2. Its a pop top but has bucket seating throughout?

My wife and I are very interested in getting one when/if they come out.
Anyone have the dope on the likelihood of that?
