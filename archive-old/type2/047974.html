&gt; &lt;snip&gt;And if it's not the temp sensor, it might be the dreaded &quot;pieces of
&gt; rotten
&gt; rubber or other junk in your fuel tank obstructing the fuel flow&quot;
&gt; syndrome&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In reference to this problem, I haven't seen anyone mention the screen in
&gt; the fuel tank outlet. It's about 2.5&quot; tall, brass I guess, fits on top of
&gt; the outlet tube. Seems to me this should prevent the above syndrome. Maybe
&gt; the injected buses don't have this screen? My 68 Westy has this screen, so
&gt; does the 66 bug project.

FI buses don't have it. Only buses up to 12/73 in US have it.
