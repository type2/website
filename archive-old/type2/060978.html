Subject: Westy tent....

Joe and all,

I read your post about selling your tent (sans bag) for $600.00. I'd
have to say that sounds pretty damn steep!! I bought an original westy
tent for my '69 about 6 months ago for $500.00 USD.....AND it included
ALL the original stuff (including the bags). The best part was...it
HAD NEVER BEEN USED!!! This is a FACT. 

I almost wish it had been used, 'cause I bought it to use it and was
tempted to hermetically seal it for future generations, but I decided
screw 'em!

Personally, I wouldn't part with mine for what you're asking, but then
again, I'm funny that way.


Jaime
