Subject: Heater

Hi
After several correspondences with Lisa about her electric heater
I came to understand that &quot;shore power&quot; in her origonal post
meant using a 120 outlet. So now I am back to the heat question.
Does anyone have a Gas heater for sale? How is the Propex heat
working. It seams to me that a propane heater would be a pain
because of the seperate fuel source, but it being brand new
as opposed to used would be a plus. So if anyone feels like
commenting or answering please feel free to. OH yeah, I may
have sold my bug which will give me the $ to actually start
working on my bus as opposed to just talking and asking
questions about it. The guy is supposed to let me know
tomarrow.....keeping my fingers crossed.........Chip
