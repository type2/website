Does anyone know where I can find a couple of &quot;gas tank retaining straps&quot;
(thanks Bentley). I had to hack (I hate using this word when speaking of
working on my Bus) one of them off because the bolts were rusted on. I
haven't been able to find these online or in the catalogs. Thanks alot.
