I guess you have not seen the gumball vending machines, that are full size
in some malls.  Someone went to the effort already, and when I was looking I
could not find out who.   Anyone know?


&gt; I have often wondered why someone with a great deal more money than
&gt; me hasn't repaired a bay or splittie body to perfection and used it to
make
&gt; fiberglass
&gt; molds for new fiberglass bodies.
