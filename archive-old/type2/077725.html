Subject: carb problems

Hello All.  I have recently installed a 1700 engine in my bus that is running 
a progressive webber carb. My problem is that the linkage for the carb hit 
the bottom of the intake  abd won't allow the second barrel to kick in. any 
suggestions? also another problem I'm having is trying to hook the 
accelerator cable up. My bus was originally a FI so im wondering how I can 
hook the accelerator cable up as the linkage on the carb is about in the 
center of the rear tin where there is no holes. any  help is muchly 
appreciated as this is keeping Dupree from the road again.
