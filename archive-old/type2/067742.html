Subject: oh no! Parts Place on the list!!!! -Reply

&gt;ack ack ack ack! parts place is on the list! ack ack ack! don't order from
&gt;them unless you got the time and patience to put up with messed up
&gt;orders. probably one of the worst vw parts places to deal with as far
&gt;as customer service and accuracy in filling orders.

I'm sorry you feel that way... I've been with Recycled bugs for over a
year now, and I know what can happen... I'll be the first person to
disagree that our customer excellent.  Right now we have one full time
representaive and two part timers.  I often find myself running out of the
sales department to pick up the customer service line to help out...

&gt;i ordered 1 one ONE halfshaft for my '74 from them last year. note: ONE.
&gt;for a '74. a '74. they sent me 2 two TWO vanagon halfshafts. and
&gt;charged my debit card (note: i'll never use a debit card to order anything
&gt;over the phone again!) something like $250 more then they were
&gt;supposed to.

This was definitely a mistake on our part...Type II driveshafts are not a
big seller at our store (Since we specialize in Daily Drivers {mostly
Rabbits/Jettas/Golfs?etc}) Even though we get many Bus and Vanagon
customers, driveshaft still are not a frequent seller (Although I have two
sets being rebuilt as we speak)... Vanagon driveshafts and Type II
driveshafts look very similar and very possible that someone picked the
wrong part... For about 6 months now we have a manager check every
single order and sign the picklist before it even gets off the counter...
 
&gt;of course when i called they couldn't do anything to fix the situation until
&gt;i got them the wrong halfshafts back. which took about a week. then
&gt;they shipped the right part to me. but they have up to 30 days to give
&gt;you the money back. and they took about 2 weeks to credit my debit
&gt;card back. well, i had just enough money for that one ONE '74 halfshaft
&gt;that particular week. guess what? i bounced my first check that week.

It's bad business practice to send out free parts...how do I know that
you are ever going to send the old ones back, and how do i even know
that they were wrong in the first place... This is not because I don't trust
the customers i deal with, it is just asking for more trouble than it is
worth. Secondly I could have sent you out the correct driveshafts out
immediately and even split the shipping charge with you if you would
have been willing to pay for the new driveshafts... then when the wrong
ones finally got to us, we would then refund your money for the wrong
ones. 

&gt;i was polite during my many calls to parts place. but they didn't seem to
&gt;care about my buisiness there and customer service actually was rude
&gt;a couple of times. i'll never do buisiness with them again. a totally bad
&gt;experience.

I'm sure that this really bothered you... but we really do care about your
business... If we didn't I would never have written back... Our customer
service is understaffed and overworked, but this is still not an excuse
for them to be rude. If they ever were I'm sorry.  

&gt;now, i understand that any buisiness can mess up an order. but the i'm
&gt;not the only one on this list to have trouble with parts place. many have.
&gt;i'll stick with RMMW or Bus Boys. Parts Place just ain't worth the hassle.

Yes any business can make mistakes...and when you have a high
volume of customers like we do, you inevitibly have occasional
problems... I hope that someday you can realize that not everyone is
perfect, and that we all make mistakes.  It takes a big man to realize he
made a mistake, but a bigger man to forgive...Please don't turn off
member of this list to our business... if you ever have any problems with
our customer service or sales people again, just ask them to please
speak to a manager, this would be either Dale, Glen, or Brian.  All three
are very knowledgeable and friendly people, and will try to rectify your
situtaion.

Thanks for your time if you even read this, and I apologize to the other
members of the list for this long reply...
