Subject: [T2] gas heater questions

I am new to the VW scene, having just bought my first
bus this spring.  Now I am looking to put a gas heater
in my bus, but I'm not sure what type of heater to
use.  I have a dual battery kit that I really don't
want to do away with, so the BN4 in the engine
compartment isn't really an option, and the archives
don't mention much about other mounting methods.  Is
there any problem in mounting it in the space under
the rear seat inside the bus?  I realize I would have
to duct the exhaust out.  Also, I've only been able to
find (and afford) a B2 and  a Stuart Warner.  Any
feedback on which is better?  Thanks for the help.
