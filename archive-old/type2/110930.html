Subject: Re: [T2] Alcohol + the bus

well hmmm i would say that drinking in the bus is fine as long as you are parked somewheres like that and not out in public where you could be arrested for open container which i dont know if they could get you for or not if the keys arent in the igniton...
make sure that you are in control of your self and dont drive..
drinking and driving is like takeing a shot gun to a family just a little example of what kind of weapon the vehicle bus or not can be used as...

you dont want that on you...

the wife and i have sat out in the carport in the bus in our on yard and listened to tunes and got ripe though...
woo hoo.. let um tell me i cant do that...
i know better than to drink and drive..
had someone close to me die from a driver that was three time arrested for dui charges.. she was a mother of three baby girls none over the age of 8 and was on her way home early one morning after working 3rd shift crossed the lane and hit her head on...
that was hard enough for me to never take another drink from or before getting behind the wheel..

peace and have safe fun..
damn i sounded like my dad used to didnt i? LOL!

&gt;Here's a Friday topic for everyone....... Is it okay to drink alcohol
&gt;inside the bus when you're parked?
&gt;
&gt;Earlier this week I was showing my friend the new Westy... and we stopped
&gt;behind his house and cracked open a couple cold ones.  I wasn't driving, so
&gt;alcohol at the wheel wasn't an issue... however just the same I could see
&gt;it being a problem at times.
&gt;
&gt;What do you all think about this?
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
