&gt; 
&gt; I have  4 corners with a small pole attached (welded)

VW calls this the &quot;angle tube&quot;

&gt; 2 of the center peak connectors

aka &quot;middle piece&quot;

&gt; and 14 straight poles

If 4 of your straight poles are the telescoping ones (&quot;corner poles&quot;),
and the other 10 are slip-together pieces (&quot;ridge tubes&quot;), it sounds
right.  Depends on exactly which tent you have.

Should also have two two-piece thinner poles for the awning, but those
aren't as big a deal if missing.

See http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html, especially the image
http://www.village_dot_org/vw/tents/pole1.jpg, for details on the poles for
the DriveAway/Add-a-room style tent.
