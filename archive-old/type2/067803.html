I borrowed and modified an engine stand for use on my T4 engine from 
my '80 a couple of years ago.  It made life a lot easier to be able 
to sit on a bucket and scrape the years of crud off that beast.  
Being able to turn the engine around on the stand was really nice.
Having it on the stand allowd access from all directions for removing 
heads, cylinders, wrist pins, etc. (didn't crack the case)  Be 
careful of letting the hydraulic lifters fall out though, oops!
