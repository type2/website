Ok, this is probably a stupid question, but how can you tell if your engineis running too lean?  I occasionally smell gas fumes.  Or, it may be that it needs idling up?  It will die at just about every stoplight if I don't downshift, which I usually never do, (til now).  and I know these engines are made to run a little more &quot;wound up&quot; than regular manual trans engines.  So, I was thinking it may just be overheating a little causing it to die.. cause by running it a little more wound up it seems to do better, and not die... 
sorry for the rambling.. 
Gail
