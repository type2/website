Subject: 71 westy no start, but bump starts fine, why?

Well Volks,

This one has me baffled, so here I am begging for your collective wisdom.
71 Westy with stock DP1600 and manual trans.

We went to the mall to look at software and when we came back out she
wouldn't start.

Engine turns over fine, but wouldn't catch.
I checked condenser condition: turned the ignition on and opened the points
manually.  Got a mild spark just like my Haynes says I should.  And this
condenser tested good (no short) two days ago.

Fuel filter: it was clean and I confirmed fuel flow from the tank.

Turning the engine over by hand I felt plenty of compression in the right
places.

I tried starting with the air cleaner disconnected, gave some time for
excess fuel to evaporate too. nothing.

I even tried spraying carb cleaner in the carb while Sharon tried to start
her.  nothing.

But when I pointed her downhill, let her roll, and dumped the clutch she
started up fine and idled perfectly!

What the heck is going on?

BTW  she has been getting harder to start lately.

More info:  timing is fine.  I have been running her at TDC at 900rpm with
46 deg of dwell for months and that's where she is today.

TIA for any suggestions
Miguel
