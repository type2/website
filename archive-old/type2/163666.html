Subject: Re: [T2] This guy should be horse whipped......

95.5% is buying not selling. Look at his transactions. 1 in 06 and the rest  
are older. He is more than likely selling it for someone else. He doesn't 
sound  like he knows what he is talking about and is translating someone elses 
words.  OR he bought it from the PO who told him he could resell it for $8000 and 
he  bought it for $4000.
