Thom sed:
&gt;There's supposed to be a pin going thru it.

Yer right!  I guess I didn't mention that the pin is still there.  Muir
says you can tap it out, but I can hardly fit my hand up there, much less
get room to tap it.  I'm trying, I just want to make sure that the hook-on
part of the cable is okay.  If so, why does it keep coming off?  Thanks for
the help.
Grace &amp; Peace,
Lucas
