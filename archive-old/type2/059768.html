I used the fan from the A/C that was in my bus, it is whisper quiet in a
loud sort of way ;-). I have it mounted right under the floor (it's
covered by the pan underneath) and it doesn't bother me at all... what
bothers me is the cheap blowers that hum and make the radio sound out of
tune and are just plain annoying. I think the bigger the motor, the less
noise...
