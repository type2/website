Subject: 66 Split For Sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I mentioned earlier in the month that I acquired a 65-66 split window.  I did 
some homework and found that this bus was delivered to the Bundespost (post 
office) in Bad Aibling (down by the Alps) There it called home for a record 
30 years and then in 1996 it became a meals on wheels for some peace groupies 
over here.  It then sat with what I thought was a bad clutch and found to be 
a spaghetti clutch cable with two strands left.  Anyhow I'm working on 
pictures this weekend and will post more as I find out.  The best part is 
that they stored in the winter since 1975 and has a whopping 50,000 original 
but because of the hills down there hard miles.  More Info e-mail me as it 
hits the paper here in Germany at $1000.00.  I think I'd let the list people 
have it for about 1000dm or 500 smackers.
Peace Out
