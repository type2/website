&gt; Option 3. Install brand new (long block?) for $1650.00
&gt; My questions are:
&gt; Why would I do a rebuild by them which is the longest time in the shop,(and 
&gt; remember I only drove my new toy 80 miles before disaster) if I can come up 
&gt; with a couple hundred more dolllars and have a new one installed? The only 
&gt; reason I can come up with would be originality, but I found out from mechanic 
&gt; that this engine was a '71 in a '70 anyway.
&gt; How can a new engine be a hundred bucks or so cheaper than a rebuild, and so 
&gt; why would I buy a rebuild? He said something about it possibly being the 
&gt; exchange rate because the total rebuild comes from overseas. I guess this is 
&gt; possible.

A rebuilt is the best quality engine if it is a _really_ good rebuild on a
good case.  The only rebuilts of this quality level that I know of are
owner-rebuilt engines.  I doubt that a garage mechanic will approach this
level of quality.  The flat-rate hours just don't allow meticulous work.

Crate rebuilts are the worst.  They are built to last just a bit longer
than the warranty.  This is the &quot;long block&quot; that the mechanic is
referring to.

New engines are imported from Mexico, but according to some there is a
difference in sourceing.  I don't know the particulars, but I've had good
luck with the new engines I've received from Bus Depot.

In VW terms, a short block is a case with crank, cam and rods installed.
A long block is an engine complete with heads.  A &quot;turnkey&quot; is an engine
complete with manifold, carb, tin, distrubutor and coil.

In your position, I think that the best chance of a good outcome is to
install a new mexican engine.  keep in mind that these engines come
without a core charge, which means that you keep your old engine.  If the
mechanic keeps it, the core charge (100-150) should be deducted from the
bill.
