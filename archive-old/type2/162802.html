George

you have better things to do than experiment with ice!  (hint - my trans-oil)

others, dont use ice!  It's a pain. I manage, even in the desert 
without it. The cooler (a 71 westy)  picks up all the road heat, I 
think through the drain hole. So I removed that pipe and blocked the 
floor.  I find milk keeps good for 3 days or more if stored in cold 
glass jars.  I put butter in a frozen thermos. I freeze a half-gallon 
OJ, a couple of casseroles (chili etc)   Dont drink sodas.

whoops, I forgot you all want beer - well, then you have to sort that 
out yourself.

if you want ice to last, shoulda been at BBB last January - a friend 
had 2 bags of ice, only one cup melted in 8 days!
