Subject: FW: [T2] Clutch?

Chuck,

You have a manual trans '75 1800 FI bus?

Don't worry about the clutch cable they stretch. These are cheap and easy to
replace. The new cable is about $6.00 and a new clevis clip is less than
$2.00. You can also replace the Bowden tube for $5.00. One thing to look at
when replacing the clutch cable is the condition of the lever where you
attach the cable to the pedal. These wear out and brake cables leaving you
stranded. Another good reason to have a spare cable in the back. We sell
these lever arms as well. These are reconditioned for $16.95.
