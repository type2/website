Alright Bus folks,
  My new engine is in, it runs good, but there are some odd changes in the
electrics. First of all, the left side back-up light, tail light and brake
light don't work although their brethren on the right side do (the
indicator lights on both sides work OK as well).
Second, the horn no longer works.
Third, the gas gauge reads full although I've only put a couple of gallons
in the tank!
Now all except the gas gauge worked OK before the old engine was removed
(in January), I've checked the fuses and none are blown and I've checked
all the taillight bulbs and cleaned the contacts with an emery board too. A
current tester shows no juice to the affected lights although all the
wiring appears to be still connected, so what simple thing is this
first-timer overlooking?
 The fuel sender unit is new and installed by yours truly, could a reversal
of the earth and live wires cause the gauge to permanently read &quot;full&quot;, or
have I bought a duff unit d'yer think? An electrician I am not, but I'm
slowly learning...
