Hi

I don't know about American electrical regs, but in the UK the guidelines
are that there is a maximum length of cable from the external hook-up point
to the ELCB/distribution point; I think its around 18&quot; or 2'. This will
dictate where the socket roughly goes, then its a case of finding somewhere
conventiently flat and unobstructed at the front and rear. Obviously putting
it on the same side as the sliding door would be problematical as the door,
when opened, would interfere. But apart from that you've a free choice.

&gt; Hello!
&gt;
&gt; I am adding a couple of accessories to my '74 bus to allow me to do some
&gt; basic camping. I obtained the AC hookup and circuit breaker and would like
to
&gt; know where the outside connection gets mounted. I figure it's somewhere
about
&gt; the middle on the drivers side. If someone could give me some rough
&gt; dimensions to allow me to accurately place the outside hookup I would
really
&gt; appreciate it. Thanks!
