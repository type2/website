&gt; Did not realize I could do that! I imagine that the trans. pivots on
&gt; the front mount? Sounds like so much more clearance for aligning the
&gt; engine to input shaft. Is there any alignment concerns with getting
&gt; the trans. back in exactly the same place?

&gt; Thanks Karl! This sounds like a great idea. Might be two weeks before
&gt; I can try it though, weatherman predicts snow for the weekend in
&gt; Northern Arizona : (

&gt; &gt; Did you remove the 2 upper transmission mount bolts? They go in from
&gt; &gt; the front, above the trans. 15mm headed bolts. The only bolts on the
&gt; &gt; bus that you need a 15mm socket for. Remove those. Then the trans
&gt; &gt; will swing down and you can slide the complete engine in.


Tom,

What Karl suggests is SOP on the Vanagon engine removal.  I have not tried
it on a bay, but I see no reason it would not work.  One thing on the bay,
though... do remove the shift rod from the nose of the trans before you
swing the trans down!  If you don't, it will really bind on you! You also
need to support the bell housing lest it fall on the floor.  A couple 2x4s
should do it.
