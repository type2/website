My 71 Westy is very temperamental. Here's the deal. New plugs, wires, cap, 
rotor, points, timed and dwelled ran great for a few weeks then seems to be 
running on only 3 cylinders then back to being fine with plenty of 
power...then another day she just loses all power and comes to a stop after 
leaving a stop sign..engine turns over and runs on what sounds to be one 
cylinder if that, won't go anywhere...after a 1/2 hour of sputtering on the 
side of road trying to get a hold of AAA she all of the sudden starts running 
on all 4 again and I take off with plenty of power. So now for the past 3 
months or so some days she's running on all 4 and others on 3 but now I'm 
back to very little power and I don't dare take it out of the driveway. 
Valves are adjusted, pressure test hit around 110 psi on all 4. Carburetor 
was rebuilt 6 months ago. I'm running out of ideas here.( worn distributor 
shaft? Water in tank?......help? Anyone near Albany, NY willing to come out 
and take a peak?
