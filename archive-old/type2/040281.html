Subject: RE: Replacing Wheel Bearings? (fwd)

&gt; It is a full day, but not too difficult.  Rear wheel bearings and grease
&gt; seals (you need both) are very available and not too expensive. Given the
&gt; difficulty of the job, I do *not* recommend regreasing used bearings here.
&gt; Buy the bearings, replace them.  The whole set is under $60


On this subject, I now have these as prepackaged Kits.  I am importing
German Febi/Bilstein kits directly from Germany. The reason is that most of
the &quot;German&quot; brands are now selling Malaysian and Mexican bearings in the
U.S., packaged under the German name, whereas Febi in Germany is still
offering these 100% German kits. So besides saving a buck or two, and
getting the convenience of a kit rather than having to pick out the correct
bearings and seals, you get all German parts.  One kit includes everything
you need for one wheel; bearings and seals.
