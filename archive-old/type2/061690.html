Subject: Newbie with electrical problems.

I'm a new subscriber and a new owner. I recently bought a 1983 Vanagon L
with a 2.0L air cooled motor. Recently the windshield washers stopped
working. I tested for voltage at the washer motor leads and found that it
danced around but showed as high as 11.5-12 volts. So I figured the motor
had gone south and got a replacement from the FLAR. Installed new motor and
nothing. Then the strangest thing happens, the wipers start running with
the switch in the off position! Moving the wiper switch to the fast speed
position makes them run faster but they run the normal speed when the
switch is in the on, off or intermittent position. the only way to get them
to shut off (other than turning off the van) was to pull the intermittent
wiper relay. Without the relay they will work in normal and fast speed but
do not return to a park positionwhen the switch is moved to the off
position. I replaced the intermittent relay and also found that the wipers
work OK when the engine is not running. As soon as I start her up the
wipers start running as mentioned above. I still don't know if the washers
will work because I have been trying to solve this other mystery first. I
did rig up a 12 volt power supply to test the washer motors and found that
both the original motor and the replacement run just fine. Any help,
suggestions, exorcisism tips would be appreciated; both wipers and washers
are essential in the Chicago area this time of year.
