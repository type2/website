Subject: Windshield Wiper Electrical

Folks,

I have a problem on my (early) 1978 bus. It is an electrical problem
involving the windshield wiper. The windshield wiper works fine in interval
mode. It takes a swipe, waits and takes another swipe. If I pull up on the
control, it also works in brief mode. It takes five quick swipes and stops.

However, if I turn the windshield wiper on low or high speed, nothing
happens.

Right now, I suspect that my problem is in the switch that is mounted on the
steering column. I suspect this because:

- the motor runs in interval and brief mode
- the motor runs free if I disconnect the switch altogether
- I took off the dashboard and couldn't find any loose wires
- sometimes the windshield wiper turns on for no good reason when I hit a
bump in the road

I would like to remove the switch and test it. However, I can't make heads
or tails out of the wiring diagram. Between which leads should I see
continuity?
