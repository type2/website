Subject: Re: [T2] re-winter storage in barns


Are the cattle still there?

Normally cows only inhabit a fairgrounds for about five days per year, it
seems like a very benign place to store cars.

(The owners of the cows are grousing about you in turn probably, &quot;my cows
are going to get oil poisoning!&quot;.)

&gt; I just stored my van today in the local fairground cattle barn, where many
&gt; people winter store their precious cars($100 for the winter). People store
&gt; them there year after year, apparently.  No sooner did I do this than a
&gt; friend of mine told me never to store a vehicle where animals live,as the
&gt; ammonia from their urine will rot the vehicle. Does anyone know about this
&gt; definitively? I'll yank it back out if the consensus is that is is true
&gt; about the ammonia.
