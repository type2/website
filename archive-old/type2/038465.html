Subject: First Engine Pull

Hi,

I posted last weekend that I am preparing for my first engine pull on my '79
Deluxe Westy, manual transmission. The weather was pretty crappy this week,
so I finally got started last night.  Thanks for all the helpful replies,
but I guess it's just a matter of personal opinion on how to go about this.
With every reply I received, I got different and sometimes conflicting
advise.  I was pretty optimistic when I started, labeling everthing on the
top of the engine.  This bus has working original AC, so was rather
dissheartened that I had to evacuate the AC system.  First real problem
occured when I attempted to remove the heater cables from the heater boxes.
Keep in mind that this engine has never been removed before (I know because
I have every receipt for all work done on her by PO).  Barrel nut on the
cable ends wouldn't budge, had to cut the cable.  looks like Bus Depot will
be getting more of my hard earned money.  Then a real problem presented
itself.  The AC compressor is attached to the left/rear side of the engine.

Here's the problem.  The bolts for the bracket that carries the rear engine
support bar is only 1 inch away from the AC compressor.  Do I have to remove
the compressor to pull the engine or is it possible to remove the bolts that
go through the support bar instead of the ones that attach the bracket to
the frame?  Is this clear, it's hard to put the description in text.  Has
anyone removed a late model, type 4, AC equipped engine before?

I've got the day off, back to the garage to work on the right heater cable
and fuel lines.  Have a great day!!

Rob
