&gt; By flywheel seal I assume you mean the large one, not the o ring?  The

for those with automatics, there is a torque convertor seal on the tranny
that the TQ goes into....it should be replaced regularly, I do mine when
ever the engine is out BUT, be sure it only goes in until it is flush with
the front of the transmission case, it will push in further but it won't
seal if you do that and leak like a sieve.

ask me how many times I took an engine in and out because some $#_at_&amp;^% that
I paid big money to didn't know that and refused to fix it !!!
