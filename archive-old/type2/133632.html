Subject: Re: How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

Through this whole conversation I haven't seen anyone ask Doug what he's
measuring. If its oil temp where are you measuring it? There are several
different places where one might install one of these and get different
readings. But the first thing to do is stick it in boiling water to find
out how accurate it is. I recommend you go to http://www.geneberg_dot_com/ and
read the tech tip on 'Why We Don't Sell Gauges.'

&gt; Subject: How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature
&gt;
&gt; I was out driving my 1971 Westy after installing a new VDO gauge and managed
&gt; to achieve what felt to me like some pretty high temperatures.  Turning
&gt; about 4,000 rmp it got up to about 255 at one point.  Is this where bad
&gt; things start to happen?  When does oil break down?  What temperature is too
&gt; high for cylinder heads?  I read through the library and found oil
&gt; temperatures of 250 and cylinder head temperatures of 350f.  Is this
&gt; sustainable?
