Hey   But don't sell them short either. There are at least 2 VW Eurocampers
in our club (Full Moon Bus Club) and they both are two of the nicest guys
you could hope to meet. Both were at Everybus 2001 (and maybe others I am
not aware of). Not to mention a ton of Vanagons. Just because they don't
drive a split or bay doesn't necessarily mean they don't appreciate the
heritage!!
Although I will admit I have passed some Vanogans and waved like usual and
they just look
at me like I'm crazy. On the other hand lots of people in beetles and even
regular cars wave all the time!

&gt; Recently I attended a BugFest in Ennis Texas.
&gt; The night before a group of approximately 10 VW vans Westfalias camped
&gt; overnight at the Bardwell Resivoir six miles outside of Ennis.
&gt; I got there about 3:30 in the afternoon and there were already seven or
&gt; eight vans there. I checken in and got spot #49, which is a great
&gt; location under a big shade tree. While returning to pay for the spot
&gt; after I confirmed it was empty a 1998 EuroVan took my spot. Not wanting
&gt; to cause any discomfort I just took spot #48 right next to it but without
&gt; any of the desirable qualities of my favorite spot #49.
&gt; Almost all of the other van owners came around within fifteen or twenty
&gt; minutes and greeted me and we all went to greet the EuroVan folks at spot
&gt; #49.
&gt; They were hospitable enough but not the general friendly folks you find
&gt; on the *list*.
&gt; I don't think they ever heard of the list or the BugFest taking place the
&gt; next day.
&gt; I think that we, as a group of very casual males and two females, kind-of
&gt; shocked them.
&gt; Well I didn't mention to them that they took my spot and everybody else
&gt; just greeted them and after a few moments we strolled off to other parts.
&gt; The thing I noticed after we left their area is that they lowered their
&gt; pop-up, disconnected their water and electricity and stayed ready to
&gt; escape all that evening. They spent the night as we all did but I think
&gt; that they thought they had just arrived at Hippie Hell or something.
&gt; So remember guys and gals there are Vanagon, TypeII and EuroVanners that
&gt; don't relate to VW owners who drive their classics and collectables on a
&gt; daily basis. Their VW EvroVan by Winnebago as just a low cost RV for them
&gt; and they aren't joiners of VW Clubs, Events, Lists or trip tales.
