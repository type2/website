Subject: Re: [T2] oil cooler

Scott,
You have my interest, but I am concerned about clearance issues with the 
sandwich adapters. I don't know if they fit once the hose fittings are on. 
Last time I changed my filter I had a long look up there and things are 
pretty tight around the top of the filter. That's why I am putting the 
question to the list though. I hope to get as much info as possible so I can 
make an informed decision. Please do take a look at the adapter and let me 
know what you think.

&gt; Tom,
&gt;
&gt; You can use a sandwich plate adapter. It mounts between the oil filter
&gt; takeoff and the filter. It has a crude thermostat built in, I think they 
&gt; are
&gt; made by mocal but the package says empi. I have one at our shop I can have 
&gt; a
&gt; look at tomorrow for the part number, and yes, you can still use a good
&gt; filter, it will hang about 1&quot; lower.
