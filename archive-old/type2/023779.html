Hi volks,

&gt; Yup, but having the 1.8 for a spare would be fine. It would be hard to
tell the
&gt; difference of the 2 hp.

 The difference is in the bottom end torque: a 2.0l pulls better from low
revs
and copes better with heavy loads and hills. Although the peak torque figure
quoted earlier is only 10 lb-ft lower than for the 1.8l it occurs further
down the rev. range, leading to a flatter torque curve.

&gt; I'd ONLY consider using the 1.8 WITH the injection from the existing
engine.
&gt; I agree, the dual carbs are troublesome and not the way to go if the
injection is
&gt; present.

 I'd agree with the conclusion, if not the logic! In the USA the dual carb
setup
was shortlived so it's not commonplace and I gather spares are hard to find.
 They were widely used elswhere and appear to be very reliable, lacking the
electrical vulnerabilities of the FI system.

 The FI system is probably superior, if properly maintained, and it is also
stock, and more common, in the USA, so your chances of finding parts and
experience with the setup ought to be better.

 Also be wary of comparisons between aftermarket carbs (like Mark's Webers)
and the stock Solexes. The Solexes were thoroughly developed by the VW 
engineers and work very, very well (ref Doktor Tim's thread from a while
back, applauding how smooth a fresh pair of Solexes was). My (UK market)
camper has a 2.0l with them and it pulls well from 1500 rpm or less in
top gear and can hold an indicated 80 or so on the highway- just like
the FI busses. I think the FI was more of an emissions solution
than a big step-up in performance.

 If the Solexes are good, I wouldn't change them, but if not I'd go FI,
rather than with aftermarket carbs if I was in the US.

 $50 is a good price for a running 1.8, the claim that the 1.8 is 
&quot;stronger&quot; than the 2.0 might even be correct, depending on what was
meant: The engine is less powerful, but because of this it is also less
stressed and so, perhaps, more durable. Maybe that's what was being said?

Cheers,
	W.
