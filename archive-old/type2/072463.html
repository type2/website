You seem to loose oil pressure, maybe?? I had the same thing happen to my 1982 Vanagon. It would start clicking/loosing power at higher speeds. It turned out that it needed a head job!! On both heads!! While the heads are off the car, you can also check the pistons for wear. That whole adventure cost me a healthy $1.800US.

Hello,

power is lost a little-not  to much. Eric says my engine sounds like it
is eating itself. I'm going ove rto the shop today to change the oil
start to weld a custom exhust and figure out this over heating thing.
any help would be so great. Thanx ya'll
