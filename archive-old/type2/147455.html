Subject: Re: [T2] Warning : What a bad clutch driven plate will do to, 
  your bus

&gt;So the balancer-man will bolt the pressure plate to the flywheel and
&gt;balance _the set_. So that when I replace the pressure plate, the
&gt;flywheel alone will be out of whack.

&gt;Why can't he balance my flywheel alone?
I'm sure you could talk him into it. . . and take your chances on the pressure plate, or pay him double to do it twice, or consider that the pressure plate will likely last 50k and maybe that's enough for a cheapo balance job, when you get a new one do it again. . .  My flywheel was WAAAAYYYY out (contrary to what Scott suggested) however my crank was basically dead on.  I did not get my pressure plate done.  I did not use the services in the link below (but similar).  just the best writeup I have seen.

good reading.

&gt;Bottom line : balancing matters, but revving hurts the bearing twice as much.

(whispering under my breath:  c w crank, c w crank, c w crank)
