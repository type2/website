Subject: Sold my westy!  *sniff, sob!!*

Well, folks, we're bus-less again.  :-(

Financial pressures dictated we had to sell Daisy, our '76 westy.  And,
realistically, I just haven't had the time to proceeed with my resto work
on her, what with my heavy work load, a two-year-old, and another due in a
couple months.  In a few years, Russell, our due-in-September one, and I
can find a bus to work on together; as it is now, Russell just wanders off
with wrenches, wants to bang a screwdriver against paint, or just gets
upset my attention isn't 100% focused on him.  Hey, life when you're two.

Christa and I agreed we needed the money and had to sell our bus.  We also
were resolute we wouldn't sell to just anyone-we had to find it a good home.

I'm happy to report I think we did find that good home in Shawn Soucy, who,
I hope, will be joining the list sometime soon.  He's new to VWs, but is an
ex-mechanic and was able to see Daisy for the solid bus she is, despite
being a little rough around the edges, and is keen to continue the project
work, doing a resto with an eye to registering her with &quot;collector&quot; plates
when she turns 25 years old in less than two years.  So I'm very lucky we
connected.  Must be all that good bus karma.

I think he'll show up at shows in the PNW, and may even go on parts-huntin'
road-trips down to California.  I hope he'll join this list, too.

Thanks for everyone's help over the years, and the encouragement Christa
and I have received from listees for our big road trips.  I'll still hang
around, I think, although I might have to drop down to digest mode.  And,
we promised ourselves, we'll be looking for another westy in a few years
when the kids are a little older and better able to help us work on the bus.

Happy camping, everyone, and see you all down the road!

Tobin
