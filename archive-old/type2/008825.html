Someone pondered:
&gt;
&gt; Does a '71 bus with a 1600 engine have any towing capacity?  Stop


We hauled a 16 foot aluminum boat with 40 HP outboard all over tarnation
for almost 15 years with a 1500 single port, and 5 people and 
lots of junk. Now, most of this is in the East, without a lot of hills
or really hot stretches.

The most important rule of towing things with a bus is to take
lots of kids with you. Then, you will have to stop every
10 minutes for a bathroom break, you will have to worry more
about 'mayo' in the oil than overheating.
