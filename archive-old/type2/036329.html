Subject: Bus Pollution

Someone commented that a Bus would probably produce as much pollution as a
new V8 Jeep.  I think that the Bus would be much worse.  Has anyone done an
emissions test of their Bus and compared it to new vehicles?  I imagine
that the newer FI catalyst-equipped busses would fare best, but it seems
that pollution control technology has come a long way since they were new.

That Honda commercial hits home to a guy who wants to be environmentally
friendly.  Can the Bus be modified to run cleaner?
