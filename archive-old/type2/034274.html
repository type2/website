Subject: Re: winter gas mileage

The reason cars run less efficiently in cold weather is because gasoline 
doesn't vaporize as well. The carburetor sends vaporized fuel into the 
cylinders and some of it condenses and turns back into liquid gasoline. That 
portion doesn't burn and is essentially wasted. And that accounts for most of 
everyones reduction in gas mileage in the cold winter months.
