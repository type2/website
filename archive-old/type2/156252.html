Subject: Cheap door seals from CIP

I had to place an order with cip because I needed an overflow pipe for the
squareback and I couldnt find it anywhere else.
In a quest for a minimum order I got the a pair of cheap loaf front door
seals for the 68. VWC-211-831-721-D2 Brazilian 23.00 for the pair.
I installed them today and was pleasantly surprised.
They are not profiled at the top corners like the good ones but they are
molded around the hinge, and at the bottom corners.
Better than I expected for such cheap seals.
I glued the 2 top corners square to the edge rather than curving around.
Probably I could have cut and glued the corners which I have done before
but decided not too.
These actually installed much better than the last time I did it on a 69
with much more expensive seals some years ago.
I had to do all sorts of trimming on those just to get the doors to close.
These are a lot better.
All in all for cheap seals, if your doors are leaky and loose and you
cant justify the cash for the good ones, i give them a thumbs up.
