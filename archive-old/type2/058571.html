Hi .

We have a '68 ghia but regret to say that we don't do anything on it
ourselves. Its in good nick and we bought it that way from the guy who
imported it from California.

Anyway we now plan to pack in our jobs and go touring, firstly around
Europe then maybe further afield. We are interested in buying a camper
van but don't know where to get started. We could do with a book with
photos of all the different types/ years describibng the typical faults
to look out for on purchase. Can you recommend anything?

We'd also love to do some sort of crash course in maintenance but have no
idea if such a thing exists. We are in London UK.

Let us know if you have any info that might be of interest. Thanks Jemma
and Ronan.

PS we enjoyed your web site and will look out for the other pages when
they are on line.
