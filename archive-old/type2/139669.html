Subject: Re: [T2] 73 Westy 4 mpg

John,

Waaaaaaay too short of a trip.  Leave the bus at home and start walking!

4 mpg sounds about right for those short distances.  Short trips like that 
really are hard on an engine.  Oil never has a chance to get to proper 
temps.



Cheers, dave

&gt; My 73 westy seemed to use a lot of gas, so I decided to start
&gt; recording mileage. To my chagrin, I learned I was only getting 4 mpg.
&gt; This has me somewhat mystified because the bus does not emit black
&gt; smoke at the exhaust, not even when cold, starting up, or revving the
&gt; motor. Nor have I observed any leakage under the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this normal because it is winter, and I live only 5 minutes from
&gt; work, so my choke is only just disengaging when I arrive, and also
&gt; because driving residential streets I am mostly in 2nd gear?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
