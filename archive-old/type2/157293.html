Subject: Re: [WetWesties] [T2] free 77 bus Update

Update:  The 77 has been moved from the Idaho
Panhandle to Portland Oregon safely.  Lots of little
things to do to get it back on the road.  It's VIN
starts with 238, indicating it is a 78.  Its motor
starts with the letters CD, indicating its a 72 17oo
dual carb.  The vehicle is more specifically an
ASI/Riviera Plan 1, with cabinets removed.  Pop-top
canvas in good condition, and engine in need of
re-assembly and installation.  Brake lines, clutch
cable, Fuel lines, and CV Joint boots in need of
replacement.  But then what else is new with any ~30
year old T2 bus?
   
The new owner, my ex-wife, has always wanted a VW
Camper.  A life-long dream fulfilled.  She has begun
cleaning the windows and panel, and has envisioned
black and white linoleum on the back floor.  Another
happy and involved Bus owner has just been born. 
Thank you Matthew.
