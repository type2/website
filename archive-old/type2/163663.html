Speaking of oddball stores...If you're into antique cars you're familiar
with Hirsch Auto Parts...Although probably only thru' the catalog. The
real joint is on Littleton Ave. in Newark, NJ and if you're looking for
Connoly leather hides, he's got 'em...The building, however, is the only
one left standing on a &quot;blighted&quot; city block...The parking lot is chain-
linked and you've gotte be buzzed-in the front door...;-(

Another Jersey landmark is Kantor Auto Parts in Boonton...Just in case
you're wonderin' what Kantor specializes in...The yellow Packard Clipper
on the roof can be seen from Route 46... ;-)
