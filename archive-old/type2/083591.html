Subject: Re: [T2] tint removal

I got it off with razor blades, some glass cleaner and lots of elbow
grease.


&gt; After unsuccesfully asking some local shops and hardware stores, I thought
&gt; I'd throw this out - does anybody know how to remove the window tinting on
&gt; my '71 Westfalia? It looks like that sticky film that is glued on the
&gt; inside of the window. How do I get this stuff off? It doesn't look like
&gt; the easiest job in the world yet...
