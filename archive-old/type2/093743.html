I think you should either tighten it by hand or set your &quot;good&quot; torque wrench to 102 in lbs to be safe.

If you watch the BugMe video with Jake Raby taking apart a Type IV engine you can see the exact damage caused by over tightening the strainer bolt: a nasty crack where the strainer bolt mounts which is where the cam is supported.  It's a design flaw for sure.
