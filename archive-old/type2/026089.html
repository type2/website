Subject: Re: [T2] Web site space for buses?

Sglw_at_aol_dot_com sends:

&gt; I have to get away from NBCI/Xoom &amp; am temporarily camping at freewbspace_dot_com.
&gt; I hate the banners and can upgrade their site for $10 a month and get 100
&gt; megs of space.
&gt; 
&gt; Do any of you webmeisters out there have suggestions for a better FTP site
&gt; that can host webapges.
&gt; I really would not mind unobtrusive Bus list banners.

A little Bus content, a little Web content. Web content first.

I used to host macsalon_dot_org at Mindspring. Thirty dollars a month for, IIRC,
300MB webspace, email manager, FTP upload/download (including all the
anonymous dropboxes you want), the whole schmear. I was real happy with them
except for the thirty dollars a month part.

Now I'm at aitcom_dot_net. They have two kinds of servers, Linux and Windows
2000. I've got a 20MB &quot;Starter Site&quot; (it's Linux; the Windows 2000 sites are
more expensive but offer more space, and they can even host your website on
a box of its own if you like) for eight dollars a month, and I like it just
fine. I think it's a little better than the Mindspring space...even if it
wasn't enough cheaper that I can now afford a cell phone within my telecom
budget.

Bus content now: Welding on Edelstein will begin this weekend! Got oxygen,
acetylene, little pieces of sheet steel, holes in the floor. I will not have
two of those things when this weekend's over. You guess which two. Also, I
ordered rocker panels and a battery tray from Wolfsburg West. Fun times
ahead!
