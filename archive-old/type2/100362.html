Subject: Resistors + Radio Interference

In his message  [T2] Mystery condenser, Richard Atwell &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt; 
asked -

&quot;So, could this be a suppressor for the radio interference that Canadian 
vehicles were required to be equipped with?&quot;

So, what is it with radio interference?  I thought that since the radio was 
in the front, and the electrical fields were in the rear, that there was 
enough separation in distance that there would not be an influence on the 
radio.

My basic question is: should I invest in resistor spark plugs vice the Bosch 
W8CC kind, something like WR8CC, or WR8CP, or even the NGK variety.

Thanks

Barry
