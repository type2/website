Subject: Re: [T2] Westfakia Gauge install

Hi Mike,

I used a &quot;normal&quot; hole saw. It has a 2&quot; blade (50.8mm) , which is just 
slightly tighter than the 52mm gauges. I used a dremel to widen the 
opening slightly and the gauges have a nice snug fit. I also had to 
remove the ashtray and modify its retainer slightly.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
