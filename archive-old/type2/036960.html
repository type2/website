Subject: Help Wanted VW Parts Counter

The Bus Depot, Inc. has immediate openings for entry-level full or part time
help.  We are located in Montgomery County, Pa. (near Pottstown, Quakertown,
or Lansdale; 30-40 miles from Allentown, Reading, or Philadelphia).

We need two individuals to answer incoming calls and take phone orders.  The
callers will be ordering by part number, so VW knowledge is not required.
What is required is a friendly demeanor, basic computer keyboard entry
ability (typing in customer addresses, etc.), and good references (a must).
While you do not neccessarily need to have an interest in VW's to get this
job, it couldn't hurt, hence the posting to these mailing lists.

We also need a third person to box and ship orders.

If you are not personally interested but know of somebody who might be,
please pass it on.

Hours are relatively good (11-7 weekdays if full time, and no weekends).
Pays about $8/hour; as I said this is an entry-level position.  However, we
are a very rapidly growing company so there is definately advancement
potential if you prove yourself.   A fringe benefit is killer prices on any
parts you may need for your own VW. :-)

Please reply by email to busdepot_at_email_dot_com.

Thanks,
