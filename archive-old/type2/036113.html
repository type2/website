Subject: clutch cable not broken

70 westy needs help

I was pulling into my parking place, put in clutch and breaking, heard
pop and felt like clutch cable was broken.  Thinking damm, then thanks
to Heidi for picking a good place to break.  Got under bus and cable is
fine, and adjusted to the max.  I can move the arm on the tranny about 1
inch easily (normal?).  Any ideas?


Thanks in advance


keith and heidi
