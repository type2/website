.  If you have
+AD4-the time, take the train to Wolfsburg (east of Hanover) to the AutoStadt.
+AD4-They have the oldest known bug, the 1,000,000th bug, the one that made the
+AD4-bug more popular than the model T (15,xxx,xxx) and on and on...They have a
+AD4-great wall mural with a bunch of buses painted in their corporate delivery
+AD4-colors.
+AD4-
+AD4-I didn't see any 50-67 buses, but I saw a few of the loaf type and alot of
+AD4-vanagons.  They also have a couple of VW magazines there (in German).  Look
+AD4-at the big bookstores in the train stations.  One is called +ACI-VW WOB+ACI-.
+AD4-
+AD4-Anyway....


Yeh I just went to Wolfsburg too. Part of our vacation, we sailed Hull to
Rotterdam then through Holland, Germany, Denmark to Sweden and back.

Autostadt is a phenomenal new hi-tec visitor centre that VW has built.
Almost like a theme park, it has cost 700,000,000DM, about +ACQ-500,000,000.
There's various pavilions displaying aspects of the VW empire  - the
historic stuff, commercials, Seat, Lambourghini, Audi, Bentley etc and it's
not just cars but some quite arty stuff too. And you do a factory tour too.

It's a great day out even for non VW enthusiasts.

I was disappointed at the lack of older VW's generally throughout Europe,
though I did encounter a small gathering of split screen vans in Hannover.

I would imagine that in Wolfsburg where everybody runs a VW from the factory
that they would have got shot of their Beetles and bays as soon as the new
models came out in the 70's and 80's. In the vast car park we were in, we
were the only bay to be seen.
