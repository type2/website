Subject: Update on reparing my stripped exhaust studs

Greetings,
     Today, I ordered a Time-Sert kit to repair the striped exhaust studs.  It
will be several days before the kit get here, which should give me time to get
some answers.
     I will have to drill and tap the existing stud holes to install the
inserts.  The engine is out of the bus, but the heads are still attached.
What advice do you folks have for installing the inserts?  Should I remove the
heads, turn the engine over with the heads attached?  Any advice about keeping
the drill and tap straight, so the finished repair will be correct?

Thanks,
Stuart
