Subject: Re: Dizzyness: Canister on wrong side

&gt; Recently got a vacuum advance distributor from my flaps; has the canister
&gt; on the wrong side of the dizzy.

Huh??  How can it be on the 'wrong side'?
What is the distributor # of this 'wrong side' unit?

&gt; Flaps guy says you can just turn the dizzy
&gt; 180 and swap the 1-3 and 2-4 wires. I tried this and got that big, ugly
&gt; backfiring sound (sounded like an AFM-disabling backfire :(, though I
don't
&gt; know).

I believe what he wanted you to do is start with #1 in the cap 180 from
where it was. But this will cause a 100% misfire. You need to put the wires
back on in the same position they were to start with. If #1 was at 11:00, it
will still need to be at 11:00. Your guide lug on the bottom of the cap will
be 180 out...if I am understanding your 'canister on wrong side'.

Unless you had a type1 distributor with the 3 degree offset for #3 cylinder,
it wouldn't matter where you stabbed the distrbutor and had the rotor
pointing to #1 to fire.
