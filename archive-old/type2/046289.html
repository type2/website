Subject: [T2] thanks

Would just like to thank everyone that answered our call for parts..... We found them fairly close and fairly reasonable.  We just brought the 78 Westy home and all is going great...... new tires next and then she will be ready for the open road.  We really enjoy this list and I'm sure will be needing more as time goes on.
