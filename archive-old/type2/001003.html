     I had a 73 Auto for about 2 years.  Except for the additional power
loss due to the tranny it was a fine bus.  All I had to do to the tranny was
replace a torque converter seal.  Other then that it was a great bus.  I had
a 2.0l with dual Dellorto's on it.

&gt; &gt; intriguing 1973 bus.  The bus is in great shape, but the only thing is =

&gt; &gt; is:  Do these buses (or more specifically transmissions) have an OK =

&gt; &gt; one.  Do you like it/dislike it?  Have you had more or less trouble with

&gt; &gt; an automatic than a standard?  Are parts expensive/hard to come by?
&gt;
&gt; there are two basic series of automatic tranny's in buses, the early ones
&gt; with vacuum shifting,  (up to 75) and the later tranny which has a govenor
&gt; shifter (76-81)  both are basically a rabbit (Golf) transmission with
&gt; different final drives.
&gt;
&gt; there are some parts that are harder to come by, but then again all buses
&gt; have some parts that are hard to find.  (torque conertors seem to be the
&gt; hardest to find)
&gt;
&gt; they are not as tough as the manual but they are not that fragile either,
&gt; they are pretty reliable though, however remember the bus is notoriously
&gt; underpowered, especially before the 2liter engine, the automatic makes
&gt; this especially apparent.  you will never be the first up the hill, but it
&gt; will downshift and keep going.  If you live in the big city and do a lot
&gt; of stop and go, it might be a more efficient or reliable unit.
