*	Your 68 bars should be round and black.
*	Starting in 69, they were 3 sided galvanized steel -- much stronger.
The round ones bend very easily......

This is strange, I have run across several sets of bars, and they are all
round and black. One set came in my 71, one set from a 69 and one set from a
73. As far as I know, the ones in my 71 are original.
