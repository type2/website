I own a 75 FI bus that has 28K miles on a rebuilt engine. She backfires on 
deceleration, specifically when I let up on the gas while the vehicle still 
has enough momentum to cause the engine to rev above idle. The backfiring is 
worse in warmer weather. I know that the exhaust system has leaks. My 
question is: Is a leaky exhaust system the most likley cause of backfiring 
and what damage does excessive backfiring do to an engine? Thanks, Darin
