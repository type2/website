Subject: ANOTHER FREE 72 VAN SHELL

Hello,

Is there anyone out there that would like a free 72 van?
I have removed the engine and transmission and most other things and it is
quite rusty. This is located in Canada just North of the Bellingham US /
CANADA border.
Any West Coast Canadians on the list other than me?
If anyones interested I will tell you the location and you can go pick it up.
I have the wheels on it still.
If nobody wants it then it goes to the crusher.
Let me know.

Darren
