   If you have an ear check out why I originally changed it all.  No matter 
what though the new alternator is staying (as I swear).  I would be driving 
and the lights would slowly get dimmer, down to candle strength, and the 
dummy light would get brighter, than all of a sudden the lights would jump 
back to bright and the dummy light would go back to a glow. I can only best 
describe it as similar to the power surges we get sometimes in our house. It 
kept doing this for about two days before occurring at a few minute 
intervals, and it got to the point of push starting and jumps. Now I know 
that much of this money could have been saved(possibly), but I had to 
consider the price of replacement in Germany (no FLAPS) and the little 
precious time I have to trouble shoot and prepare for the move.  I would 
strongly advise new list members and owners to take the time and troubleshoot 
not only to save money but to learn the ins and outs of Volks ownership.  
Really weird but thought maybe with a few more off the wall clues it might 
ring another bell.
Peace Out
