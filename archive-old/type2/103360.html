Subject: Wood interior for the Westy

good day all
i have a 74 westy and the interior is in great
condition, except the wood paneling has lost its color
in some spots...the wood itself is fine....

has anyone ever tried to sand the paneling and then
try to stain it to match the original color(or any
color)?

ive found a color stain that matches it...

if anyone has any input or can point me to a website
where someone has documented this please let me
know...


thanks in advance
chris m
