&gt;easily but I can measure lift, and more is better.  Given this, there
&gt;should be a performance *increase* by using the solid cam, not a hit, with
&gt;the downside being possible accelerated wear due to heavy valvetrain
&gt;combined with a more aggressive cam.  Next time I will try it unless the


I will say this, I have measured both in as fair a way as I can, the
hydraulic cam is roughly .290 lift intake and .285 exhaust, at least out of
my '72 1700.  The hydraulic is about .255 on both.  My duration measurements
are a bit vaguer as I used teeth of the cam gear as a degree reference and
even interpolating the bumps and dips this is a bit tough.  I get about
250-255 degree seat to seat on both but can't get perceptible resolution for
better, perhaps the hydrualic is a bit longer.  Now note this, there is NO
aftermakrket performance T4 sold (except one) that is even this mild (as the
solid cam) WEBER used to have a .315 at 250 duration, WEB-CAM's mildest is
like .333 and 276.  Boston Engine claims he has seen solid in hydraulic
mills FROM VW on many occasions.  Now most recent thing I found, last night
in fact, and a great site period.

http://www.elgincams_dot_com/main.html

shows a very nice reasonable hydraulic grind (in 914 section) having U
guessed it numbers of .294 lift and 258 duration, damn near the solid cam,
with I'd guess from reading the literature, probably less steep ramps for
the hydraulic lifters.  In fact I'm going to call and talk with these people
soon as they open.  I'd note the cam is in the Porsche section and you have
to scroll sideways to see all the cars.  Taking these factors in mind,
having looked at the fact with the stock crank and rods there is plenty of
clearance even on the tight #2/#4 intake lobe, and believing pretty much
that Boston Engine is not bull shitting, if I could get a brand new German
solid lifter cam for $65, you better believe I'd run it.  Before finding the
Elgin site, I had pretty much decided on buying a WEB-CAM ground to stock
solid specs.  But what the hell do I know.

ALL hydraulic and solid T4 lifters are ridiculously soft, which is why the
wear concave then the razor shop sides start cutting the center of the toe.
I note both Boston Engine and Elgin note that all hydraulic lifters are not
created equal hardness and quality wise.  I intend to ask Elgin whose I
should buy as they apparently do not make/sell lifters and have no need to
lie about such things.

Anyway with stock parts, and stock heads there is no way anything is going
to hit anything else, particularly when you look at the sort of lifts the
aftermarket says bolts right in, worst case I'm figuring the solid cam isn't
&quot;quite&quot; optimal grind wise for a hydraulic lifter but I don't see a damn
reason to believe as Wilson's often incorrect book (when it comes to T4
details) is anything more than a CYA statement of little value.  I'm
guessing a slight performance increase as well, probably one reason why some
T4's ran a bit better than others brand new.  But again what do I know.

I do wonder about Wilson's statement to use the solid rocker spacers when
converting, I don't see an immediately obvious reason for this but one could
exist, it certainly sets a positive limit to sideways deflection of the
rockers on their shafts, what this means I'm not sure.

My opinions totally here folks, YMMV definitely do what you feel is comfy.
