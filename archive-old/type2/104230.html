&lt;&lt; If I had it to do over again, I would use a smaller woofer (10&quot; instead of 
12&quot;) and probably made it a bit taller and shorter (front to rear).  As 
another listmember mentioned, a port would probably improve the sound 
somewhat.

Try Parts Express...IIRC, they had some online specs for box size and porting.
At the very least they'd have the plug in tuned ports...(Or you could go all
the way and wade thru the Speaker Cookbook...)
