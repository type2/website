&lt;&lt; Traditionally in New England cheap vehicles usually go up for sale at 2 
times
during the year. At the end of the camping season, before the snow hits, and
starting when the weather starts to turn. The http://www.thewantad_dot_com is
pretty thin in the used car sections, but there is alot of snowmobiles for 
sale
:D  &gt;&gt;

If the oil profits/prophets are accurate, the used car and Bus prices should
be interesting in a few weeks when gas crosses the $2.00 mark...Quite a
few projects might be going on the block to keep the &quot;real&quot; car topped
up... ;-(
