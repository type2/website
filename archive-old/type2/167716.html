Subject: Re: [T2] Removing a rusted side vent window

&gt; There's a local bus I am doing some rust repair work on, and part of
&gt; that project is replacing the side rear window vent with a piece of
&gt; solid glass. The problem is that the original vent wing has rusted
&gt; shut, and the lower frame of the vent wing has corroded away to
&gt; almost nothing.

I did this to one of the windows on my bus and when I popped the
rubber out the whole thing including the glass and vent window came
with it, maybe it was that rusted I don't know but never gave it a
thought.
