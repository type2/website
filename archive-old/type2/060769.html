Hi,

&gt; Any Information on identifying the name of this layout would be appreciated

 Sounds like a Devon to me. The cooker should swing out on hinges so you can use it outside the sliding door. There was probably a coolbox under the sink, once upon a time.

 Do you have a poptop? The type of poptop often gives a good indication of the conversion (though it's not a sufficient indicator in itself).

&gt; IE. How do I tell if its a westfalia for example.

 If it were a '71 Westy the poptop would be front hinged with canvas sides and an integral rear roofrack. The top would cover the length of the roof though the rear third would be rack rather than poptop.
 It is quite possible that the interior has been fitted sometime after the vehicle was first registered. You may even have some bits of a Devon with a Westy pop-top and a few homebuilt cupboards, or something similar.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
               W.
