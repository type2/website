Subject: Re: [T2] T O or release bearing early bus/beetle

so i put the  new super clips on there and mounted T O bearing...
  checked bowden tube sag and adjusted clutch.....
   
  when pushing in the clutch there is a slight wine from the throw out bearing i can hear.... ????? does that mean its bad or it might be rubbing something...? maybe i didnt install clips right? surely so did it like the book said or so i thought..?
   
   
  and the most important thing is...
  driving up the road....?
   
  1st is there all the way....
  and reverse is there all the way but 2nd 3rd and fourth just slides and feels like it isnt catching....?
   
  and the rpms go higher...?
   
  does this sound like the transaxle..?
   
  i sure hope not..?
   
  thanks for any help...
  i drove way out of the way today and after all my efforts and putting engine back in and all something still isnt right,..?
   
  there is no more stuttering or shaking but that slippery 2nd 3rd 4th worries me... and clutch feels good now....since to bearing isnt hanging and is attached...
   
  also there is alot of drips around the front of the transaxle...........?
   
  maybe i should get it level and then check transaxle level.... even though i just checked it not a month or so ago..?
   
  still worried about those slippery gears?????

                                                                Better start thinking about sealing up those windows and leaky doors....
  Winter months are on there way,dont forget to break out the heater and Lets Go CamPing~!
