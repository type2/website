Subject: Re: [T2] good news

It's hit and miss on HF.  Sometimes you get lucky.  
  
  Oh, I forgot to add that I finally picked up a Bentley off of Ebarf for  $12!  Other than a guys name written in the front, Bruce Jamieson  (listee?), I can't tell it's ever been used.  But even after  reading the body section twice, I still can't figure out why my cargo  door doesn't close properly.  I have to push down on the back part  to get it to set.  Bentley talks about how to adjust it if it's  not aligned at the top or bottom but mine is fine.  It's only  closing it that's a problem.  
  
  Metric jack stands, hmm.  Are you pulling my leg again, Karl?  Cheers....KR

I am still looking for metric jack stands.......

Sounds like the HF one has blown its seals.  Cheaper to replace it than repair it!  I used to have a
Hein-Warner floor jack, was big $$$ when I bought it new..... it also blew its seals internally. Cheaper to
buy a HF floor jack than fix it also. And so far the HF Chinese one has outlasted the high $$ one!
