Just had my 32-34 PDSIT's rebuilt 1600km ago along with the having the
motor rebuilt
&gt;from an 1800 to a 2.0 litre.

Twice in the 3 weeks since bringing it home, petrol has leaked past the
needle &amp; seats,
past the rings and into the sump, filling it to the point where it
leaked out the (disconnected)
old mechanical fuel pump (with a split in the diaphragm).

After the first time, I took the tops of the carbs and LH bowl was dry
???   Local mechanic
just nodded and reckoned it would have siphoned dry.  How?? The big pipe
going from
the throat to the fuel chamber would have ensured atmospheric pressure
in the fuel bowl
chamber (i.e. no pressure build-up) so how when the fuel level in the
bowl drops below the
level of the main jet outlet in the throat, how does the fuel syphon
uphill?

I replaced the needle &amp; seats after that and now the different
replacement brand the rebuilder
provided, did the same thing.

I caught it in the act the second time when a friend dropped around and
spotted the
dripping. This time it was the RH carby and, looking down the throat, it
was steadily dripping
&gt;from the main jet outlet (down-facing thingo) in the centre of the
throat. I quickly pulled &amp;
plugged the fuel line and whipped the top of the carb ASAP &amp; found the
fuel level was 19mm
below the top edge (with no gasket).  I had previously checked the float
level and it was set at
13.5mm before, so the fuel level here was well below normal, not above.
As the fuel was still gravity
feeding from the tank, I unplugged the fuel line and put more in the
bowl. I found that it only
started dripping again when the fuel level was ~ 8mm below the top of
the bowl which is roughly
the level of the main jet orifice.
Huh?!??  What's going on here?

I've never had this problem before on any car, but I gues my type 2 is
the only one that
has the fuel tank above the level of the carburettors, enabling the fuel
to gravity feed.

Is this a common problem?  I imagine that putting a cutoff  solenoid in
the fuel line just before
it splits to left &amp; right carbs would provide future security - any
other thoughts?

The thing that annoys me most is that I spent the money on a rebuild to
have some security
and assurance of a reliable motor and am part way through fitting LPG in
order to extend the
working life of the motor (yeah, had especially hardened valve seats put
in) and now I have this
nagging uncertainty that this leaking may well have happened before on
other occassions
but the bus didn't stand long enough to fill the sump to overflowing and
so be noticed, just
enough to dilute the oil to some degree and cause premature wear before
being boiled off
when the oil heated up.

After the first incident,  I drained the oil &amp; filter for 2 days before
refilling both and cranking
the engine with the plugs out for 30 - 45 seconds to move fresh oil
through the passages for
a bit. (The only thing I'll do differently this 2nd time is to put some
oil into No 1 &amp; No 2 cylinders
through the plug holes to give them some instant lubrication to replace
that washed off by the
petrol).  Later, I checked the compression:

No 1  = 130psi
No 2  = 123psi
No 3  = 128psi
No 4  = 112psi

The difference between No 1 &amp; No 4 is 16.1% or 13.8% depending on which
one you
compare it to; either way it seems way too much for a motor with only
1600km on it.  I suspect
No 4 was the cylinder the fuel drained through the first time. Before
this incident, the motor
purred evenly and it hasn't since - more of the unneven dak-dak under
acceleration.

Given how I dealt with the first incident, I am surprised by the low
compression in No 4 cylinder,
which leads me to think there may have been one or more undetected
incidents before that in
order for that degree of wear to occur.  What do y'all think?

Now I've sent the carbs back with my friend to Perth where the rebuild
was done (410km north)
for checking and then I'm looking to muster up the determination to push
for the whole motor to
be stripped down and checked for wear, not just No 4's barrel, piston &amp;
rings, as the motor is still
very much under warranty. What's the general feeling on the
reasonableness of this request?

One sure lesson here is a local rebuilder is a lot handier than a
distant one if you have problems.

One last question, do electric fuel pumps normally allow fuel to flow
through them when they aren't
running?
