Subject: Re: [T2] Severe Flooding Solved (long)

Ray,

You might consider checking your venting on the gas tank.

If the vent is stopped up, then the expansion of the fuel from a warm 
engine is pressurizing the gas tank.

Just a thought.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I posted a problem a month or 2 back that I was having with my '71 with a
&gt; stock 34PICT carb setup with rotary electric fuel pump. It was severely
&gt; flooding a few hours after the engine was shut off. It would take over a
&gt; minute of cranking to clear the excess fuel. A few times it even failed to
&gt; turn over do to hydrostatic lock from excess fuel in one of the cylinders. I
&gt; have resolved the problem and a few people asked me to post what I found.

&gt; 
&gt; My fix was to install a check valve at the carb fuel inlet. Now my flooding
&gt; is minor and is more in line with what other people have complained about.
&gt; The valve I used is a McMaster-Carr p/n 47245K36. It's a little pricey at
&gt; $11 because of the type of plastic which is fuel proof. At some point I'll
&gt; probably replace it with a metal one and metal tubing since I have a no
&gt; rubber or plastic fuel line components in the engine compartment policy.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope someone finds this information useful.
