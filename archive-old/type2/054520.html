Hi Volks!

&gt;    Do any of you know if the windshield wiper mechanism (motor, 
&gt; linkage,shafts, ect.)from a 77 bus will fit into a 71 without modification?  

Never having transplated them, I'll say probably yes.
At least I've never notcied nor heard of any difference,
which I probably would have considering the number of
buses that were stripped by me and the Volks around me...

No guarantee though.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
