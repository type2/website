Subject: Re: Driving in the wind

The original poster in this thread mentioned, if I correctly recall, 40 
mph gusts.

Do not go looking for a technical fix. There isn't one.

Nothing is going to help much under such conditions (or higher gusts). 
Driving through a constant 20 mph crosswind is hair-raising enough. With 
higher gusts, you get off the road and wait for better conditions as you 
would in a duststorm, or a white-out. Wind gusts don't last indefinitely 
and the type2 is a high profile vehicle. Pull off, see a movie, make 
phone calls and relay your regrets.
