i love doing this under the right conditions

    Late one night, on the way to a National Forest area to camp in the
    rough, we took a country road detour. It was late, and under a full
    moon, we turned off the headlamps and proceded gently by the light
    of the moon ...

i note that my children will not get much chance
to do this as all the modern cars have the lights
on, like it or not.
