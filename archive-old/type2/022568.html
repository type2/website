I think I can contribute something here...

While restoring my 70 campmobile, a long and arduous process if you want to
do it right, I decided to do some tests with various products as I had
access to several products for demonstration purposes. Simple results here:

Cascade:
A spray-on (should be professionally done, the compressor needs a wide
nozzle) thin foam that doesn't expand much after application. I tested this
on the inside of the sliding door, as well as the opposite wall. It worked
pretty well, and would be fine for quieter cars, but probably not enough
noise reduction for our purposes. If you want your car &quot;a little quieter&quot;,
this is your stuff. You will need to remove everything and clean/mask your
surfaces before application. The neat thing is that this stuff is water
soluble, so if you really don't like it, a garden hose and a big sponge gets
rid of it. Ask me how I know.

Various tar-like materials.
A friend of mine is a roof installer. He loaned me four different sheets of
the tar-based roofing materials, two of them wrapped in plastic (layered),
two of them not. Again, pretty good, but the smell on the unlayered types
was unbearable, and the smell on the layered types was noticable enough to
keep me from wanting to sleep in it. One could only imagine how bad it would
be once the sun and engine heat affected it. I can't tell people to stay
away from it enough. Bottom line, use the right tools for the right job.
This would be great for your roof. We aren't driving roofs.

Not-quite-dynamat-like-stuff.
Another company whose name escapes me, and I'm too lazy to do some searching
on the net to find, makes a similar to dynamat stuff that sells in squares.
It's dense, thin, moldable, and contains various materials within it to
widen the range of sounds it absorbs. This was great stuff, it also added a
considerable amount of weight to the bus. My understanding was that it had
lead among its materials, thus contributing to the weight. It was only
slightly less than dynamat, and for the few extra pennies, I could get the
nice stuff that had it's own adhesive.

and finally, Dynamat.
Which as you all might expect, is what I'm using. It's expensive. It's also
heavy. It also goes on pretty easy, though the heat gun takes time to do
right. Every car that I have heard that is dead silent uses dynamat. If you
want to save some money, you can kill most of the noise by lining only the
top of the inside of the engine compartment, the backside of the firewall,
the backside of the gas can compartment, lining the gas compartment with
non-heat-conductive foam, and under the rear seat of the bus. This killed
about 40Db from the engine. It took a weekend, but it worked.

I'm still driving the equivalent of an empty tin can while I figure out what
insulation to use and use my empty shell for hauling things for friends
(sure, they'll tease me about my bus until they want something moved....)
but for now, I'm pretty happy with my engine noise levels. Still figuring
what to do about road noise levels, but hey, what's the rush? ;)

Hope this helps.
