Subject: Re: CDI noise

Sorry Bucket, I build Air-Cooleds for a living, ie, support my wife and kids, 
pay the mortage and set some aside in the college funds. I'm also a 
Machanical Engineer. Masters Degree. Use to work Aero-space. I have NO sense 
of humor when it comes to engines, and there relative systems. NONE. 
NEVER.NOPE. PERIOD. NADA. I don't find it in the least bit funny. Every day, 
I get people in my shop who have gotten the most ridiculous information 
imaginable. You are not helping this at all. This list is susposed to help 
people. Not shine them on.

Schroff,
John Connolly answered your question.
I advised you how to stop the noise.
Gives you an option.
Since you have no sense of humor, I won't tell you it was a joke.
You might consider increasing your dietary roughage in any case.
Bucket
