Carlos,

    Glad to help, lets keep these cars, trucks, bus'es, things, Ghias, etc.
on the road where they belong. Anything I can do to help, just yell.
    I would like to extend this invitation to anyone on this or any
Volkswagen related list. If I can help, just yell!
    A great idea, don't mash, restore! ;-) ;-)
