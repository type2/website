Subject: Finally, a type 2 in the family.

Hi,

I've been lurking here for a good while, dipping in and out.  I drive a '72 1200 Beetle myself, but I'm looking to sell her (once she's fixed up) and buy a late bay.

My Dad's just got himself a '78 Devon converted bay window, with a 2l dual solex'd engine and two sliding doors (walkthrough?).  It's called Wyatt (the reg number starts ERP.)  It's in a bit of a state, and he's having two real problems with it at the moment.

Firstly, while the engine performance is pretty good, it backfires a *lot* at idle.  Without a touch on the accelerator it'll sit there and pop and fart all day.  There's some rust damage to the heat exchangers that I can see, but we've not had chance to get it over the pit or drop the engine yet.  Any ideas on what to look out for, or what might be causing this backfiring at tickover?

Secondly, there's a lot of play in the steering, and it's really prone to windage.  Presumably there are steering box adjustments that might tighten it up, but if all else fails and he wants to replace the steering box, are there different ratio boxes available so's he can fit a smaller diameter steering wheel and have more turns lock-to-lock?  Perhaps a transplant from another type of aircooled VW?

Any advice gratefully received.

Cheers,

Chris.
