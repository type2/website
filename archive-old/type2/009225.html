&gt; Hi people.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what I can use for the rubber
&gt; molding which is on the rear pans between the bumper and the body on a 68-71
&gt; bus. No one that I checked with ( all the usual suppliers) have any. One guy
&gt; even laughed. If anyone has any ideas, I could sure use one. TIA TBear


If you are really careful, you can split vacuum hose (sold by the foot)
into a 'C' section and use that. It will stay on reasonably well. It seems
to like to fall apart after about 2 years, though. Mabye it was the
rubber formulation I used. Windshield washer tubing would 
prob. also work. The hardest part is splitting it in a straight line
for the 15 inches you need. I prob. wasted 5 feet when making 30 inches
of the stuff.
