Subject: Re: Gauge Fogging Problem

Mike/All,


I don't know the source of the fogging, but I'm
willing to bet some cold, hard cash that it's not
related to whether they are mounted tightly or not.

I have the typical VDO trio (oil-temp, oil-press,
cyl-head temp)&lt;as well as the large VDO tach in place
of the factory clock&gt; under my stereo, above the
ashtray. Mine are held in place
by...(ahem!)...duct-tape! And I have *no* fogging
problem. Not in dry-arsed Arizona, nor in soggy-arsed
Oregon.

Now, before anyone chews me a new one, the guages are
mounted 'solidly' in their holes...I simply used the
duct-tape to wrap around the individual guages and
fill the gaps. I actually threw the VDO screw-on
mounts away, and rely on the tight mount to hold them
in place. It's worked fine so far (2+ years, 18,000+
miles).. and I can remove the guage-trio quite easily
for access behind the dash.

Is it the best way to mount? Probably not. But I had
my reasons;-)

Still, I don't have the fogging problem, so I think
it's safe to say that this is not the culprit.

Contrary to another listees advice, I would suggest
sealing the guage itself, but make sure that *all*
moisture has been removed, first. Maybe place them in
a *very* low-temp oven for a few hours, then seal
them???


I dunno. Good luck at any rate!


Jaime

&gt; Yup, the light fogging happens on Itch as well. But,
&gt; the left and middle
&gt; gauges aren't really mounted tightly (that's where
&gt; the fogging occurs), so I
&gt; figure that's the problem. The right gauge (A vdo
&gt; tach) is mounted solidly,
&gt; and doesn't fog.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been talking myself into taking the dash apart
&gt; to lube the speedo
&gt; cable. Might do it this W/E, and tighten up the
&gt; gauges while I'm at it.
&gt; 
&gt; Which brings me to this question: Should I tighten
&gt; the gauges only when the
&gt; humidity is low?
