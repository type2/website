Subject: Re: [T2] What is and what can be done about rusty rockers.

Very simple fix,(rockers open and close the valves)
pull the rockers off the head, take them apart. take
them to a place where there is a bead blaster and
clean them up. Be sure to wash all the blast material
off the parts(soap and water)dry them very good, then
oil them and put them back together. put them back on
the heads, re-adjust the valves, put the valve cover
back on and you are done, be sure to check for oil
leaks when starting the engine.  Phil
