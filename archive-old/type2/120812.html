Subject: Re: [T2] friday topic   new bussing song compilation

Hi Andy,

How could you leave The Who's &quot;Magic Bus&quot;  off that list?  OK, I know 
it's about a transit bus rather than a VW bus, but still, I make sure 
it's somewhere on my playlist when I burn a CD for a roadtrip.

I would also add &quot;Long Line of Cars&quot; by Cake.
