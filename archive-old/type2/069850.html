Subject: NO CINDERBLOCKS!

        Agree with Surfer Bob- cinder blocks DO NOT have the
compressive strength to support cars, no matter how many years
that '56 Chevy in Homer's yard has been up on 'em. Cinder blocks
literally crumble to dust when overloaded,
        If you can't afford steel jack stands, use heavy timbers
or the like. Maybe stack the wheel you've removed on top of the
spare and set 'em up as a safety block at least. NEVER get under
a car supported only by cinder blocks or a jack.

        Still alive after all these years,
        Bill
