compression test.   the results were:(
#1) 0
#2) 110
#3) 110
#4) 105
so all were a little low, but #1 seemed
excessive:)(trying to keep a positive attitude)  so i
squirted some oil into #1 and retested and it came up
to 45.   so looks like lizzy isnt going anywhere for a
while.   so am i to assume its bad rings, seeing ive
heard no expensive noises, or???   what should my next
step be,

I'd check your valve adjustment first.  Look at your valves on #1.  Is one
of them tight?  If so try to adjust it.  If you can adjust it properly, do
so, then retest the compression.  If it tests OK, drive it a coupla hundred
klicks, then recheck the valves on that cylinder.  Has that valve tightened
up again??  If so, you might be looking at a dropped valve seat.  In that
case, the engine comes out.

If the valves were OK on the first check, I'd think the next step would be
to yoink the engine and head and see whats up.
