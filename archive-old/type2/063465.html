Subject: CD Player in Buses

I want to put an new stereo with a CD player in my '77. I talked to 
some guy at the local &quot;we sell you big huge stereos&quot; store and he said 
I might eventually have problems with as it ages due to the angle it 
will sit in the dash. Most cars the stereo goes in level, in the buss 
it will sit at a downward angle.

Has anyone had trouble with there CD players?=20

If its just going to wear out faster I won't spend as much money on it.

Thanks,
Patrick
