Subject: [T2] Bus Problems...Help!

Hello Everyone!

If you remember, I have just got done putting the engine back in my bus, and everything ran great, except I still had at least 1 valve tapping, so I adjusted the valves again and now the engine sounds great but it will not idle at all. Does that mean the valves are too tight? It seems as though if I make the .006 feeler slide in and out easily then I get a tapping noise, and now if I make it a tight fit it will not idle.

Can anyone help?

Also, another problem is that 3 of 5 times I tried to start the bus I had to push start it. I never had to do that in the past, not once. I know there has been a lot of talk about hot start problems, but it happened to me when I went to start the bus for the first time today. I turn the key and hear a click, and then nothing. subsquent tries I don't even hear a click. Ah hum...

Thanks for all your help through my first engine pull.
