Subject: flaps, thermostat(People w/ parts busses PLEASE READ)

Some of you may remember that I was having trouble finding where
my flaps and thermostat are. Well that is because one of the PO
removed them. I finally figured out where they are supposed to be.

So, several questions here. Will any flaps from a pancake fit
or do I need some from my year ('74).?
What should I expect to pay for a complete setup?
Does anyone have a complete setup for sale?
Thanks.....
