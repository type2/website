I posted a scan of the cover of the 1968 (it says 1967) Westy Manual that I 
have at:

http://www.geocities_dot_com/thegreatjose/VW/68Westy.JPG

It's pretty neat, as it has both German and English captions for all the 
pictures.  As far as I can tell, the Westy interior for 1968 was the same 
for 1969, so maybe a new manual was not published for 1969 (my best guess 
as to why none can be found).

&gt;Last year I went to look at a 1968 which had the Westfalia supplement in 
&gt;the glove box. Odd.y, on the cover was a picture of a bay window bus but 
&gt;the cover said 1967 Westfalia. Perhaps it was Euro and was refering to 
&gt;production year instead of model year.
