Subject: [T2] Is it feasible with my bus! (Big winter trip)

Since you'll be travelling through snow, and since you have a relatively 
rust-free bus, I thought I'd suggest some undercoating, even if it's 
bar-oil.  It'll keep your undercarriage from getting trashed.  You might 
want to have some spare wheel bearings and grease as well.  Trusting the 
P.O. to have done anything is like playing roulette.

	Eron
