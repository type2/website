I am not mentally incompetent, not a psychotic maniac, nor a bizarre 
individual, even though I own not one, but TWO 1980 Vanagons.  I have 
owned one for 12 years, the other for two weeks.  I have had just 
about every conceivable problem with my bus (except for FI problems, 
knock on fuel hose) including head problems.  The problem lies with 
getting poor quality heads.  Either through bad components (valve 
spring broke 6 weeks after installation, wasting that head) or having 
a head worked on by a moron (the valve seats need to be staked in 
properly, not just press/heat fit into position).  BTW the set with 
unstaked seats was a VW Rebuild, the other a particular lot of a 
Brazilian set.  I drive about 100 miles a day in my Westi, up &amp; down 
the foothills here in sunny (hot) California.  Until I hit the 
lottery I will still have one of these vehicles.

I have come to appreciate the uniqueness of an '80. The Vanagon is a 
very well designed vehicle combined with the tried and true air
cooled engine, using the (as Ken says) most sophisticated air cooled
engine on the planet.

Keep it, appreciate it, get it running properly.  I go the second one 
to provide much needed smog parts, and other misc bits and pieces.
