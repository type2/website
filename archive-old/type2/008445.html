Subject: stool material
Date: Thu, 25 Feb 1999 16:33:26 -0500

I recently recovered a 4 legged stool to match the orange interior of my 74
Westy.  The stool that I bought had the blue plaid material on it and it is
in pretty good shape.  Since I have no use for this material, I thought
that I would put it up for grabs on the list.  If anyone wants it please
pmail me.
