Volks,

Thru the years, VW has used three different systems of holding the
adjustment on the front wheel bearings.  

On the splits and early bays (thru 1970), they used a double nut with a
flanged washer between the nuts.  This washer has a tang that projects
into a groove on the axle stub and two tangs that project out past the
flats of the nuts. What you are supposed to do is adjust the wheel bearing
play with the first nut, drop the washer on, then clamp it with the second
nut (cranking the two nuts together to sandwich the washer), then bent the
tabs on the washer to keep this assembly in place.

The disc brake bays ('71-9)  have a split nut with an allen-head screw in
it. You adjust the bearing play and then tighen the allen-head screw to
keep it in place.

Vanagons have a nut with a collar.  You adjust the bearing play with the
nut, then peen the collar down into the groove in the stub axle.

Since I now have one of each of the body styles, I have had to deal with
each of these systems.  Of them, I prefer the bay system (split nut) by
about 15,000%!!!  This was the high point of VW engineeering!!!  The split
nut and washer system has not betrayed me... yet :-)  but I only have 300
miles of experience and I was not too confident in it at the start.  The
bay system seems to me to be ideal.  I can adjust to my heart's content
and hold it precisely when I tighten it.  In a total of about 300,000
miles on different buses, I have never had one come loose or rotate
between adjustments.  The Vanagon system... it is the pits!  First, it has
come loose on me twice now.  And the nuts are one-use-only! and only
available from VW!  And bloody $6.00 per nut!!!!!

I am thinking of replacing the nuts on both my split and Vangon with the
late-bay style, and would love input from anyone who has been there.  I
believe the axle stub never changed, and I belive that the split nut will
fit under the dust cover on any year, but I have not (obviously) tried it
yet.  Does anyone have experience to report?
