Subject: Engine seal question

Hello
AS I began to tear out the reminents of my old foam type engine seal,
I noticed that in ceartin places it was adhered to the engine tin.
Do I need to install my new seal with an adhesive, or was this
just the result of an old seal mwlting to the engine?
BTW, the metal insert on the old shock was stuck to the bolt
and it took 2 days of soaking it in WD-40 and my vice grips
to remove it, but it worked. I now have KYB shocks all the way around
even though it will be some time before I can test them to see
exactly how beneficial they will be.

BTW ( again) my favorite locally owned parts store that I have 
a good relationship with cut me a deal on my caliper. $35 plus 
$10 core. If this turns out to be wrong there is a chance that
I will cry...;( but probobly not....
