&gt;I was wondering what the listees out there use for
&gt;a bike rack?

Phil - I am a bit of a serious cyclist, 
and I haven't found anything to beat a rack that clamps to the tow ball.....

it is a very simple design &amp; can carry up to three bikes... 
imagine two 3ft bars side by side, thus II
join them about 3 inches from the bottom
so they pivot like a scissor action &amp; open into a V, 
the bottom of which have cups welded that clamp to the ball,
they then go up &amp; out in the V shape,
a third bar goes across the V to make an upside-down A 
..and locks into place for security... still with me?
at the top of each bar protrudes a horizontal bar..
..which sticks out the back of the camper for the bikes to hang from.
... simple &amp; effective.

the one I have is made in Yorkshire England, 
if you are interested I can hunt out the details... it works real good.
I used it going round France, UK &amp; Ireland, and in Ireland the roads are
real bumpy.
.. without a problem...

the only draw-back is that it has to be removed to get access to the engine
hatch, 
but it removes in about a minute.
