Subject: Re: [T2] Optima Batteries

Well, here's my solution (not for everybody, of course, but it works for
me):

I got a basic Pep Boys battery and the $10.00 battery box.  Most of the
time, I keep it in the basement connected to a float charger.  When I go
camping, I pack the battery, charger, and a small inverter in the bus.  Most
of our camping is in summer weather and for extended periods of time (up to
about 10 days or so) in places where there is no power at the actual
campsite where the bus is parked, but there is power within a short walking
distance.  Since my Westy is a 71, there is no Westy electrical load and we
use ice for cooling food.  We set up a canopy next to the bus, and on that
we string Christmas lights for use at night, so the lights constitute our
major electrical load.  The only other things are charging cell phones and
camping lanterns, etc. and sometimes a blender for those special beverages.
Since power is withing walking distance, when I get up each morning, I carry
the battery and charger from the campsite to the power source, and charge it
up, so it's ready for the next evenings use.  So far, I'm still using the
first and only battery I've ever purchased for this purpose, but I think
it's on it's last legs.  I'm gonna load test it soon and see where we stand,
might hafta get a new one.

I've been doing this for about 5 or 6 years, and am basically happy with it.
But, solar charging is on my radar, and as soon as I can come to terms with
the cost and how to install the equipment on the bus, that will be next.  It
would be nice to elimate those groggy eyed morning battery hauls.
