Subject: Off-Idle Hesitation and a New Carb

List:

I've already checked the archives.

No, there isn't a 009 dist. on my bus...  Just a new stock 34PICT3 and
everything else the same.

It didn't hesitate before the carb swap, but it does now.  I suspect the
carb.

I followed the procedure for setting up the idle circuit and the choke, it
idles fine.

I tried adjusting the accelerator pump, but this makes little or no
difference.  Still, it hesitates just between idle and takeoff as if I have
a 009.

Again I reiterate reduntantly:  It did not do this with the other carb.
What have I done wrong?

I await the wisdom of the List.
