Subject: Re: [T2] 70 westy engine reccomendations



&gt; I have a 70 westy with a dual port 1600 in it. Since I have had it I have
&gt; had problems with leaking oil and overheating. I think alot of it has to
do
&gt; with the extensive driving I do

Extensive driving is not a cause of engine failure, Extensive driving with a
poorly timed engine, missing engine tin, leaking oil and missing engine
compartment seals, clogged fan housing etc. causes engine failure.

&gt; and lead foot

I have a VERY heavy foot, but I have everything that the factory intended to
be on my engine on my engine, I can drive the heck out of my bus for hours
on end and when I stop I can lift the engine lid and FIRMLY grab the
dipstick and hold it for as long as I want, no heat at all.

&gt; and it being a small engine
&gt; for the weight of the bus.

There are several people on this list with older Westies with 1600cc engines
and they do just fine.

&gt; I want to be able to drive long distances with
&gt; reliability and decent gas mileage. Has anyone replaced there engine in
&gt; there westy with great success in these areas. I really dont think my
engine
&gt; is worth messing with because its got so many problems most recently being
&gt; the heads and there stripped spark plug holes. Any advice would be greatly
&gt; appreciated

My advice, before trashing your engine,  pay a GOOD VW mechanic to check all
of the problems your bus has, I bet you will be surprised at what a good
mechanic can do.

&gt; and where I can locate
&gt; the engine at a reasonable price.

Whats your Idea of reasonable? $500???? I dont think you are going to find
an engine worth any driving for that price. Your looking at around $1000 or
more for a good &quot;NEW&quot; engine.
