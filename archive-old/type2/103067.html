&gt;Rear fog lights? I don't believe I have seen these (or can really come
&gt;up with a good use) anyone got any pics of what this particular beast

M571 was the code for rear fog lamps.

Regarding an earlier email, I also came across M531 in ETKA: heavy duty coil spring shocks front and rear although the library page says &quot;With harder rear torsion bars&quot;.
