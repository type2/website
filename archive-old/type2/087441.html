Subject: looking for bus

hey everyone,
       i live in the washington DC area and i was wondering if anyone knows 
where i could find a bus for sale. i'm looking for as much rust free as 
possible. A splitty would be nice but i could settle for a bay westy. it 
would be nice to have the price as high as 4,000.

thanks a lot
