Hello,
    Unfortunately I'm one of those who don,t contribute anything to the list ,
but love it alot. Bob Hoover has contributed alot..... How anyone could insult
someone who gives for free is beyond me. I don't know if there is anyway to
repay him or get hime back but I'd like to know. Although what's in it for
him? I don't blame him for leaving, but maybe all the silent people can show
they really did appreciate him. Thanks everyone.
   Patrick
