Subject: Re: [Valve seat out]

Terry,
I was wondering when we'd hear about this.  If you can install that seat
yourself and make it stick for better than 20k miles, you could make money
rebuilding heads.  I'm sure you've heard rebuilt type4 heads are notorious for
dropping seats - worse than stock heads.  Mark Stephens gaurantees their
heads: http://www.sagecountry_dot_com/mshp/ and are the best in the business if
you listen to this list.

I don't know that i would worry about the piston unless it changed the shape
of it - bent it somehow. This would show in the wear patterns on it and its
cylinder.  Check em out - follow your Bentley. 
There is a possibility when the piston was hitting the valve, it bent the
connecting rod or affected the crank somehow, but i think this is unlikely -
steel against aluminum- sort of like 'rock beats scissors' if you get my
meaning.  Seems to the variable would be on the head side of the equation.  It
also depends on how long it ran that way...

In addition to a new head, i'd say worst case scenario, you put one (1) P&amp;C
set in it (somebody will have one -ask around- doesn't necessarily have to be
new, just good.) - make sure the piston is balanced with the others - might as
well put new rings in while its torn down, maybe check rod bearings... oops!
Maybe you are headed for a rebuild.

No, really.  If the piston is not mussed other than the ding in the top, put a
new head (rebuilt, probably) on it and enjoy your bus.  I'm not saying the low
end is for sure undamaged, i'm just saying it is unlikely.

I'm getting ready to put a piston in my engine that came from an engine that
had dropped a valve.  There is a semi-circular indention in the top of the
piston where it hammered the valve. Truthfully i am not worried about it. The
piston showed no abnormal or excessive wear patterns otherwise and is within
the 'wear limits' prescribed by the Bentley manual. I don't know about the rod
or crank from that engine.

As usual, take in all other information on this before acting.  The best route
is of course a total rebuild - that is the only way you'll be completely sure
of what's inside, but we're not talking blueprinted and balanced 3-liter
racing engines running 10:1 CR here. Just about every ACVW engine running up
and down the road today has an unbalanced, dirty engine beating itself to
death with every rotation and most of them - you wouldn't know it.

Your mileage may vary and good luck,

&gt; Took head off right side.  #1 valve seat apparently fell out and is now
&gt; lodged at an angle between valve and head.  To make matters worse there is
a
&gt; very shiny ding about 3/4&quot; long and 1/16&quot; wide in the piston, made by the
&gt; valve in its current nonstandard position.
&gt; 
&gt; Guess I'm buying a new piston, rings, cylinder.  Am I buying an entire set?
&gt; This is a 2L engine and the price of a set of four is kinda ouch.  Am I
&gt; buying a new head as well?  That hurts too.
&gt; 
&gt; I read in Wilson's book that installing valve seats is a major job of
shrink
&gt; fitting.  However, I have access to liquid nitrogen (to cool the seat) and
a
&gt; well-controlled lab oven that will go to 250 deg C or more.  How practical
&gt; would it be to put in a new seat meself?
