&gt; I'm with John. I'm now considering dropping a 2L in my 73. It's a

Hey there,

I haven't been following this thread that closely, as I already have
a 2.0L :)

Sorry if someone has already mentioned this, but, you also have to
worry about flywheel, bellhousing, and clutch stuff. I recently went
though this with a friend that was putting a 2.0L in a 75. (frantic
phone call)

74 and 75 use the 215mm flywheel and clutch (I don't know about the
earlier type4 bays, 210mm??). 76 and up use a 228. You hafta use the
flywheel/clutch package that goes with the bellhousing that's in the
bus, or you can also swap a later bellhousing to use the larger 228mm

gear in the 74 and 75 tranny. (Check the archives for specifics on
your buses year. Searches for 228mm and 215mm worked for me)

Sami also mentions this in his 911 swap page at:

http://www.simplecom_dot_net/dakhlia/bus-stuff/911bus/911bus.html

My friend choose to use new 215 stuff instead of swapping the
bellhousing with the one from the donor bus that supplied the engine.
Concerns about smaller clutch surface area were discussed, but he
wanted to get the bus back together quickly. These things happen when
you have a Boston Bob newly rebuilt 2.0L sitting under the bus.

He wanted to get that engine in as fast as he could so he could drive
it :-)

Oh...  and don't forget the exhaust system too. Even though the 79
2.0L engines have square port heads (one year exhaust), the 72-74
muffler fits fine (w/o Egr and Cat on my 79). 75-78 is the other
exhaust group, so this has to be considered too. (Busdepot's new
catalog is a great resource for students of bus exhaust). 

HTH,
