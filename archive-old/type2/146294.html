&lt;&lt;  You know a good place to look for tools is your local Pawn Shop. A

warning, only buy name tools, Snap-On, Craftsman, Mac, Proto, etc. The same

lifetime warranty applies to them, the tool company's don't know where you

bought the tool.

 &gt;&gt;

But when you bring an old and broken Craftsman tool back, you
get a new ready-to-break Craftsman tool... ;-(

BTW, if you really don't care who's name is on the pocket of your
jeans, L.L. Bean's catalog says, &quot;Satisfaction guaranteed, forever,
period.&quot; And they really do back it up...I've mailed a few items back
over the years and gotten replacements...And once, got a check
because the shirt was no longer being carried... ;-)
