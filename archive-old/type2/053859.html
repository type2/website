Subject: screwy in second gear

Hello all,
I was hoping to have a happy &quot;I just got my bus going after 2 months of
repair work&quot; post, but alas it seems trouble is afoot. I just replaced the
transmission in my 69 Westy with a used one I bought form a semi local
mechanic. When I drained it of it's ten year old fluid, I found no chunks of
metal or anything strange. The nose cone, however, had some rust on the gear
selector and detents but I wire brushed it off. When I finally got the thing
in and the bus running, I found that I had no second gear. It would go into
the area where second should be but the wheels locked up and the engine
stalled. All other gears work fine. My question is: is this a crappy
transmission or a crappy installation? Are their any adjustments or
procedures that I can do without removing the whole thing again in order to
fix it or at least determine what is wrong?Any help would be greatly
apreciated.
Thanks,
Jeff Mitchell
69 Westy &quot;Weezy&quot;
