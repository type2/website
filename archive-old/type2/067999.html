Subject: Re: Fuel tank replacement problem

&gt;&gt;Hello all!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I recently replaced the fuel tank on my 81 Vangon.  The tank the dealer gave
&gt;&gt;me is actually for later model vans.  Seemed to be the same, until I came to
&gt;&gt;the final step, hooking up the line to the fuel pump.  They increased the
&gt;&gt;size of the spout coming off the tank, so now it does not match the hose
&gt;&gt;going into the fuel pump.  VW used to have an adapter, according to the
&gt;&gt;dealer's parts guy, but it looks like they no longer stock it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Has anyone else run into this problem and found a way around it?  Any help
&gt;&gt;GREATLY appreciated.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks in advance!  Please send email  to:

&gt;
&gt;Thanks again -- I want my &quot;brick&quot; back!  :-(

   You walk into any plumbing shop or dept. and you can probably 
 find what you're looking for.

 We are talking &quot;sweat fitting reducers&quot;. You will still have to 
solder it on there tho unless you want to take a chance on epoxy
which I would not.

 An alternative would be to stick a piece of &quot;proper&quot; size hose on 
the tank, come down to about six inches from the pump and put a &quot;hose
to hose&quot; reducer in to bring it down to the proper size for the pump.

 This would save you having to &quot;sweat&quot; the fitting onto the tank.
