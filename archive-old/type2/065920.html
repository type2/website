This is something I'd been wondering about for a while..  I _do_ have
one of those original air cleaners (bought it last summer when the
cheapo Bugpack one I had broke into 1000 pieces while I was 200 miles
from anywhere), but I don't have the hot air hooked up.  How do I hook
it up?  The sheet metal has the hole I need (sort of near the
crankshaft pulley), but I don't see how to connect the hose on the
muffler side.  Do I have to have an original-style exhaust system
instead of the (probably junk as well, but it hasn't fallen apart yet)
Bugpack muffler I have now?  Is this worth worrying about?
