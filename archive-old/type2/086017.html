Subject: Re: [T2] gauge mounting

I don't know what make of gauges you are using, but VDO produces a flexible 
gauge mount that has 1, 2, or 3 holes, and it mounts under your dash -- that 
way you don't have to hack holes in your dash....  I've seen them on the Bus 
Boys website: www.busboys_dot_com.

&gt;    I have decided what gauges I am going to install  and decided on
&gt;three to protect my new engine.
&gt;I am going to purchase a head temp and oil pressure first. Later on I'll
&gt;add oil temp. So I want to plan
&gt;on provisions for three. I am not really sure where I want to mount them
&gt;yet. Where are yours mounted and how do you like them there?
