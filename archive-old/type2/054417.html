Subject: tune up questions

1) in the library, bartnik notes it is important to set the idle properly
before doing engine timing. muir has those steps reversed. which is
correct, please?

2) muir notes checking vacuum advance is done by sucking the tube from the
air intake distributor to the dizzy. the plate the points are on should
then move. i get no movement, nada. if no movement, muir says change points
and condensor. is there any more to it then that?

thank you,
steve
