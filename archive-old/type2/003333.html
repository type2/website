Subject: brake booster.


Hello,

Is there a way to test a break booster that is not on the bus?  Can I just
unhook the line from the booster that is on the bus and connect the line to
a second booster? If so, is there something I should look for or listen for
to tell if the second booster is good?  I'd hate to go through the trouble
of installing the second booster and then find out it is no good.

Thanks
