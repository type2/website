&gt; I've got M-B alloys on my Bus, and yes, the bolt pattern is the same. But,
the
&gt; bolt holes are just a tad too small to pass the Bus studs and the shoulder
on
&gt; the M-B's wheels needed to be rounded out to seat the Bus lug nuts - The
&gt; M-B wheel uses flat-faced lug bolts and the Bus uses acorn lug nuts...

Flat-faced lug bolts???   No way, ALL MB wheels and wheel bolts are tapered.
All have steel inserts in the lug bolt holes. All except the M class, the
140 body S class, and the new 220 body S class are 12mm bolts. VW and the 3
I mentioned above are 14mm. If you knock out the steel inserts, then the
wheel lug holes will fit the studs....but you loose the tapered seats for
the wheel lug nuts. Do NOT knock out the inserts, drill them larger.
