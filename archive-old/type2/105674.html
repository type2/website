Subject: Everybus Carabus from N. Virginia/DC

With only a week to go, I haven't seen anything on either list about a Carabus
to Everybus from N. Virginia/Wash. DC. I've heard from most of the Canadians,
sounds like they will be fewer in numbers this year, and some are coming down
a day earlier. I don't know if I'll have my usual backyard campout again this
year-shame too, it's usually the most excitement Round Hill Virginia gets all
year! Anyway, as in years past, my daughter and I (and anyone who shows up at
my place)  plan to leave early (9:00-9:30AM) Friday, taking Rte 15 over to Rte
29. We've met up with folks at the Sheetz gas station in Opal, Virginia, right
where Rte 17 intersects Rte 29. We should be passing through Opal around
10:30-11:00 AM. If anyone wants to join us, please email me!   Jeff
