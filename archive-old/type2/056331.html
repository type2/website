Subject: NEED! : Lock Screw For Coupling '78 Bus
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Help!  I am looking for a lock screw that is avoiding me.  On the way =
home from work,. the screw that holds the shift rod to the transmission =
(goes through the shift rod and slightly into the transmission input =
shaft?) fell out. (Go figure, right?) Well, my '78 Bus is the daily =
driver right now and I cannot afford too many days without it.  If =
anyone has one of these lying around, please e-mail me ASAP and I will =
send you my snail mail address. Will pay whatever price and S&amp;H, but =
dealer is saying at least a week and my closest junkyard recently =
crushed and recycled all their busses. :(.

Thanks!
