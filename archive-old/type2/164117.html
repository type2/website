Subject: Fwd: [T2] 34pict3 idle and wacky RPM readings

Ryan: I won't be able to offer a solution, because your symptoms 
match very well my own experiences with 34PICT-3s.

I own four of them. Three of my four won't idle below 1000 rpm, no 
matter how much care I take to adjust the two screws.

One of my four reacts according to Bentley when I adjust the screws 
and it does idle. Needless to say, I'm running this one on my 1600DP. 
By the way, I am running an SVDA and Compufire. I do have one 
circumstance that might affect things. I know my heat riser pipes are 
clogged, so icing is almost certainly a factor for the first few 
minutes each morning.

My experience is that some - make that most - 34PICT-3s just are not 
tunable.  A month of frustration with swapping these around sent me 
to The Samba for a pair of dual carbs.  When the weather allows, I 
intend to remove the 34 and run these.

Sorry I don't have a solution. I hope others do.

Jack
