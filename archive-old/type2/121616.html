Bentley is correct of course.

&gt;Not to start a FART, but where should I pursue a replacement? Can the
&gt;typical National FLAP supply this?

Yes.  What you need is a Wells VR-something regulator.  Available at 
Autozone.  From the archives:

&gt;All things remaining equal, my wallet

Your wallet will like the Wells regulator even more.  It's under $20.
