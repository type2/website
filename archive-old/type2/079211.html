Subject: Re: [T2] Metal fuel line



Bill said:
I was replacing some fuel lines and reinstalling my fuel pump yesterday.
I noticed that the metal line that is above the tranny is
rusted real bad. I was going to use a piece of brake line, but wanted to
make sure that will be ok first. Do they sell metal fuel
line in lengths like brake line?
Happy Holidays!

Someone may still sell it?? Anyone???
I just buy the straight 8' lengths * brake line from NAPA* then cut/bend as
needed.
