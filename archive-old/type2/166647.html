Subject: Fw: Directions to get to Watkins Glen coming from the NORTH

Hi guys, I have been getting request for directions to Westies at Watkins for
next weekend.
 
Here are the directions to get to Watkins Glen coming from
Buffalo (North West) and Syracuse (North East).
******************************
From Buffalo/Niagara Falls area:
*****************************
 
Shuffle through Buffalo to the NY State
Thruway (Interstate 90) heading EAST towards Syracuse and Albany 
 
 Continue
EAST on the Thruway for about 95 miles to EXIT 42 - GENEVA
***********************
From Syracuse area:
**********************

  Head
WEST Towards Buffalo on the NY State Thruway (Interstate 90) 
  Continue WEST
on the Thruway for about 40 miles to EXIT 42 - GENEVA

Common direction to the
SOUTH:
 
As you exit the toll booth turn right onto Route 14
head SOUTH Go
through the town of GENEVA
you will cross Routes 5 &amp; 20 

Continue SOUTH for
about 40 miles

There will be some nice wineries as you travel along Seneca
Lake
 
Go through the downtown portion of Watkins Glen on FRANKLIN ST
 
The
State Park Visitor Center and the Glen creek will be on the RIGHT
&quot;9th Street&quot;
will be on the left 
After the Glen creek and before the gas station at the
red light make a RIGHT
Take the next RIGHT on Corning Street (Route 329) and
head up the hill to the State Park.
It becomes &quot;Old Corning Road&quot;
Bear right
on &quot;Walnut Road&quot; following the signs to the State Park.
Continue (on route
419) into the State Park.
 
If there is a park official at the booth, let them
know that you are with the VW camper at the Club house.  You should not have
to pay here.
Continue into the park past the pavilion and bear left up a very
steep hill, indicating &quot;Campground&quot;
Creep up the hill (unless you have Subaru
power) to the next ranger boot.
Stop there and register for a pass, again do
not pay and tell them that you are with the VW group. 
I will collect $20 for
each day of camping from you and turn over the money to the State Park once we
have a known count.
Continue past the ranger booth up the hill to the Club
house. 

Our camping area will be about 1 mile further on the left.  A big
open field and a warm club house.  Pick your spot on the grass and come
register.  
 
If you have a GPS, these are the numbers that I am getting from
goggle maps 
for where we will be camping at Watkins Glen State Park:
42.367621, -76.885554
 
 
PS I've ordered some T-shirts and have 5 different
colors and 5 different sizes including XXL.  Cost will be $12/shirt.
 
 
Let
me know if you need directions from a different area or if you need any other
information.
