&gt; I am perplexed at what to do about my fuel line hoses.

Change em!

&gt; I look at them and they are dry, not cracking and actually look like there is
&gt; nothing wrong with them.

they fail from the inside out.
Change em!

&gt; To be honest, they look better than any fuel line I have seen in recent years.
&gt; They are rubber with a cloth covering. There are no cracks or bulges anywhere
&gt; at the ends or in the runs of the line.

you can get really good fuel line hose if you wish at a hydraulic heavy
machinery repair shop...get metal wrapped ones if you wish but

Change em!

&gt; Do I still have to replace them, just because they are likely 30 years old.

they are 30 years old

Change em!

&gt; It is a 1978 CDN Type 2 Campmobile.

I have a 78 and when I first got it (and since) started to change the fuel
hoses they fell apart in my hands.  also change the flexible brake hoses
that go to each wheel they swell on the inside
 &gt;
&gt; If I disturb things, It is my fear that I will end up with a not perfect
&gt; clamp, or some other fault. I am told by my mechanic, who has worked on the
&gt; busses for years to watch for cracking or wetness.

put new clamps on and check em to make sure they seal but

CHANGE EM!
&gt;
&gt; In my opinion, using the axiom &quot;The enemy of Good, is Better&quot; applys here.

in this case' are you willing to put the life of your bus, and possibly
you and your family on the integrety of 30 year old fuel lines

Change  em

&gt; Some one talk me out of this, Please, I am having a terrible time talking
&gt; myself out of it. ;-)

I'm an engineer, I would not trust a fuel line over 10 years old,.

have I talked you out yet!!???

Change em!!

Bob
oh and change those fuel and brake lines
