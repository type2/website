Ok, time for a Friday that I've been wanting to ask...

I haven't owned my bus for long, about four months, but I've noticed a 
strange phenomenon while driving it. Time seems to slow down, almost come to 
a halt, while I'm in my bus. Used to be, my drive to work was a near-panic 
episode, constantly watching the clock on the dash, speeding up to make that 
yellow light, ripping away from the lights, etc. I used to drive a little 
sports car and it only made things worse. But I got rid of it and bought my 
bus and things have definitely changed! There is no clock to watch and 
ripping away from stoplights is definitely out of the question. But, for 
some reason, it doesn't seem to matter. I leave when I'm going to leave and 
don't think about the time again until I get out of the bus at work. No, 
there are no 'substances' involved and I do tend to be a little hyper, most 
of the time. Something about putting down the road in this over-grown 
lawnmower makes the commute much nicer.

Is this only happening in my bus? Do I need to call &quot;Unsolved Mysteries?&quot; 
Just thought I'd ask. =^)

And what is good, Phaedrus,
And what is not good---
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
