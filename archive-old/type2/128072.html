&gt;&gt;Those who pianted yourselves...where did yuo do it.
Can I cover the walls of my garage with plastic
sheeting and do it in there??&lt;&lt;

Well you could, but just know that paint is going to
get EVERYWHERE, and I mean everywhere, even inside
closed things believe it or not. Plus if the garage is
attached to your house, then fumes will also get in
the house. Very unhealthy for children and other
living things.  I do it in my barn, which is yards
away and detached from my house,  but I suppose you
could hang plastic sheets from the ceiling creating
your own &quot;booth&quot; which is barely larger that the bus,
just make sure you have one wall of the &quot;booth&quot; by
your open garage door with a fan blowing the fumes OUT.
