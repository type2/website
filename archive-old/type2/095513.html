Subject: RE: [T2] Magfire electronic ignition???

   These were manufactured in Taiwan by Latest Rage( if you read the mag ads
you have seen them) There is a 90% per-cent return ratio and were recalled
due to massive failures. EMPI also sold these and stopped. I don't know if
they have fixed the problem but I will stick with Compufire and know that it
will work and won't let me down.

California import parts sells this apparent knock off
of the compufire electronic ignition.

Does anybody have any experience in particular with
this electronic ignition kit (Magfire)?  It is $39.99
- $20 cheaper than Pertronix.  What about California
Import parts in particular?

Any help would be appreciated
