&gt; Could you pull the 1.8 heads off a '75 FI engine and bolt them to a 2.0 '76

&gt;
&gt; Are the size of the valves on the 1.8 FI heads, and the 1.8 carbureted-fed
&gt; heads  the same size??

No .. and umm,, No

Btw,, to search the archives, it makes it a LOT easier if the subject
lines sort of sounds like the body , It is hard to remember &quot;Someone said
-&quot; that next time you try and find the info from the archives...

here is a list of head info,, from the archives

here is alist of what I know about Type 4 Cylinder Heads
author unknown

Part Number Engine Valve Sizes, [intake x exhaust, mm] Notes
021-101-371J 1700 39.3 x 33 Some had breather pipe or CHT sensor fitting for
carb. vehicles; some also had EGR holes by intake ports.

021-101-371Q 1700 39.3 x 33021-101-372 1700 39.3 x 33
The 1.7 heads can be interchanged with 1.8/2.0 cylinders. It will be
necessary to machine the opening to match the larger cylinder end.1.8/2.0
Series

021-101-371H 1800 41 x 34 or 39.3 x 34 f.i. models had the smaller valve
sizes; some had EGR holes; some
had CHT sensor021-101-371S 1800 41 x 34   or   39.3 x 34

022-101-372G 2000 37.5 x 33 CHT sensor on one side; sodium filled
exhaustvalves

071-101-371A 2000 37.5 x 33 The &quot;Vanagon&quot; head; exhaust ports not compatible
with earlier exhaust systems or most aftermarket exhausts.

071-101-371B 2000 37.5 x 33

039-101-371A 2000 42 x 36 The highly desired 914 head; easily identified by
3-intake port studs; steeper spark plug angle. Generally believed to be the
best starting point for highest HP.
