Subject: Re: to buy the '71 or not to buy

I asked the same question about our 72 Westy. I got mine for $400. and I
thought WOW, it wont take much to fix it up, no body panels to replace.

Any way less than a month latter we have spent over $2,500. just trying to
get it on the road, I'm waiting on a AVP engine and other things and that's
why the bill has increased so much. We did have a budget set and we have
come very close in this short amount of time.

The wife, the dogs, and I have gotten in the bus and had a meal, we've
played cards at the table and we have even taken a nap on the bed, we have
already enjoyed our bus without it being on the road. We plan on moving it
to the back yard during Christmas and having an official Camp Out. Any one
want to join us, it's called the Murray Back Yard Annual Christmas Camp Out.

So.... if you have $2,500 to $3,000 for a bus project I say go for it. IT
WILL BE WORTH IT......

&gt;Found a 1971 for sale $500.00. Has the usual rust but the PO has all the
&gt;panels to replace the cancereous areas(+). I will view it this week in
&gt;person. Has an oil cooler leak (+/-). Has Westy interior(+). Needs tires
and
&gt;brakes (+/-). Owner saved all parts, plus has extra stuff that goes
with/for
&gt;the bus(+).
&gt;
&gt;Has been welded up with &quot;horns&quot; so (owner speaking) &quot;that it can accept a
&gt;bug motor... don't know how to judge this(-)(-)...NEED SOME IMPUT FROM THE
&gt;CONTINIUM.
&gt;
&gt;What do you all think? Worth the price? What about the welding up for bug
&gt;motor?
