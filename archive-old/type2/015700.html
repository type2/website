&gt;My '77 Bus came with two nice 6x9 ovals set low on the front doors near
the step plates. They have pretty heavy plastic grilles on them so your
feet don't damage the speakers and they sound pretty good. 

At one time I decided I didn't want to damage my uncut door panels, so I
installed 6x9 speakers behind them without cutting any holes.  I was
suprised when I could actually hear them pretty well, and of course they
were completely hidden (this was soon after my bus had been stolen and
recovered).  You could add some tweeters to regain the high frequencies
absorbed by the door panel and have a decent sounding system.
