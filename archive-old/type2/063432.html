Well I've never seen a Bosch or a Mann filter damaged but as another
cut on Fram I'll say that their FWD H20 VW filter the 2870A or whatever
does not have critical antibleedback valving the OEM or even Purolator
filters have.  Is is amazing that Fram with the widely accepted best
filtration medium in their Extragaurd filters insists on cheesy build
quality and incorrect or ommited valving.  This of course makes no never
mind to us Bus crowd as our archaic filters are just that filters only,
and although the 2870A is used on Wasserboxers it likely makes no
difference there either as the lifters are below the filter.  The FRAM
Bus filter is getting hard to find some places BTW and is not listed
in most of the new books, Muir says you can use the rabbit filter of
course maybe you can, personally I pay about $4 each for the Bosch and
am happy doing so, always have, always will.
