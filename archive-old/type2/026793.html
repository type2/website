Pop top seal for pre-'74 camper top.

This is 'new, old stock' ONE PIECE seal (covers ALL four sides of the 
poptop).  Still has VW stocking tag on it.

This is for someone intending to restore a pre-'74 camper.

Not cost effective for someone just trying to replace their seal for a daily 
driver.  See Bus Depot for that item(s).

Please reply via P-Mail.  Thanks
