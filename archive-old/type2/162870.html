&gt;I have been using oil analysis for the 1776 I built since it's
&gt;inception. The procedure is to drain 4 ozs.of hot engine oil into the
&gt;supplied plastic bottle.  Send it to the company and in about a week, you
&gt;will receive a report that tells the metal content of the various kinds of
&gt;metal in the oil.  My 4000 mile oil report showed a little more copper than
&gt;average; however, the report credited this to the break-in of the engine.
&gt;The oil analysis has made me feel a lot more comfortable about the
&gt;functioning of my engine and confidence in the engine's durability.  Well
worth the $25.00 the test costs.

	Right on Ted.  This is an informative test, providing in many 
circumstances early warning of undue wear before damage occurs.
	I'd only add that you may avoid the $25 if you have a 
suitable buddy in a big trucking outfit that is already getting 
dozens of these analyses done each month.
