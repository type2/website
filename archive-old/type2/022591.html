ok here is the deal on my tire questions.   

a lot of the archives mention getting stronger sidewall strength in your 
tires ( ie light truck tires etc.)  but have many of you actually searched 
tire shops for these tires.  light truck tires rarely have much more side 
wall strength as the archives would let you believe are needed.  i had a 
bunch of mails sent to me last week from people who use certain brands and i 
looked into each and every brand the listees sent me.

none of them were acceptable.  all were under the 1520 lb minimum the bus 
requires ( stock).  one member mentioned that it would be worth every penny 
spent to buy at least a 6 ply or even an 8 ply.  the only thing i found in 
those parameters was what the tire shops called *a trailer tire* .  a 
superheavy duty tire that has a high load capacity ( capacity only determined 
by how big your wallet is )  and had the highest sidewall strength. they had 
a 6 and an 8 ply.   my question is since these are called * trailer* tires 
could they be used with good success on a van??  trailer tires are made to be 
just that...only used on a trailer....no turning, no curb checks, smooth ride 
not needed...only that they be super strong.  

anyone have any extra info on this...or possibly WHERE  to find good tires.  
the tire rack is a good web site but doesnt carry the specs on each tire you 
might be interested in ( weight ratio, aspect ratio, sidewall ply 
etc.)........

fwiw..the van is a work van....i haul loads in it regularly.  heavy loads up 
to 2500+ is only once a month.

am i being paranoid....or should i just go buy a set of dunlop sp-40s and 
call it good???
