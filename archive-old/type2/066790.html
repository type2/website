&gt;&gt; even put it up on the web if I got the correct info. Anyone want to bite 
&gt;&gt; on this?

&gt;I have pix in a boox of some of the early prototypes, and I'd also
&gt;like to have a good set of pix of all the different models.  I'm
&gt;buying a scanner in the near future, when I get the time...

Let me know if you need a hand scanning some stuff. I've got access to a 
color scanner, and would be more than happy to help. Were you thinking of 
adding this to your own pages? 

It'd be great for those of us wannabe Type II &quot;birdwatchers&quot;. I can 
picture it now, hordes of us standing on freeway overpasses with our 
binoculars, in an attempt to spot a rare '54 barndoor deluxe!
