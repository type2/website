Subject: Re: [T2] Need a VW in San Jose, CA

Hi Richard,

2000 miles in a vehicle they've never laid eyes on??? &lt;&lt;Shudder&gt;&gt; Never 
mind the 100 gallons of gas he'll need... I'd be more concerned about 
the dreaded &quot;First Year of Ownership&quot; expenses. There's a very large 
proportion of such things that will &quot;pop up&quot; in that first 2000 miles.

OTOH, it could be as simple as the fact that the vehicle may not have 
turned out to be as good as advertised. Like the one those poor hippy 
kids in the thesamba thread got saddled with. At least this guy had the 
sense to back out of the deal.

Many of us in the east think of CA as a great source of rust-free used 
cars... $1500 for something with a solid body but marginal mechanicals 
would still be a good investment.... Just take it home and throw a 
fresh motor/brakes/tranny/suspension/whatever in it and you're still 
ahead over what it would cost to have a professional do a complete 
restoration on an otherwise OK rust-belt vehicle. I like to refer to 
this as &quot;the Dolan Technique&quot;.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; How do people convince themselves that flying across country to buy a

&gt;
&gt; Personally I think the money would be better spent on a return ticket. 
&gt; $1500 doesn't buy a very road worthy car for a cross country trip as 
&gt; he already found out. I hope he saves enough for the gasoline bill 
&gt; he'll have to pay to get it back home.
