Subject: Re:Disc Brake Drag

Dave,

	The time I had my disc brakes drag it was because the brake pedal
wasn't returning all the way up when I took my foot off of it.  Does your
pedal come all the up and hit the stop when you release it?  In my case it
was nothing more than 30 year old grease on the brake pedal pivot that had
gummed up and was holding the pedal back.
