Subject: Dune Buggy Big Help

If any of you folks are building Dune Buggies this tool is a big help.
http://blackhead_dot_netfirms_dot_com/vogel.html
I've used it about two years and my vision got so bad from HeliArc, Mig
and Liquid Flux welding that I just had to stop welding.
All of the welding equipment was sold off but I've still got this little
item.
