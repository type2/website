Subject: Re: [T2] RE: painting a bus

&gt;$1900.00, But well worth it. It takes evertthing off. If you have any rust it
&gt;will be gone and then some. But it lets you know where your weak spots are. A
&gt;little extreme but for my first resto I wanted to start from the ground up.
&gt;This way I will get to fix and reinstall every system in the bus and have
&gt;hopefully a good working knowledge of the whole bus. Good thing I have a very
&gt;supportive wife. Hell I extended out two years in the Navy just so I could 
&gt;take
&gt;advantage of there hobby shops here on Camp LeJeune. I figure that will 
&gt;give me
&gt;enough time to get it right. Maybe

Be ABSOLUTELY sure that you rust proof all the hidden crevices and crannies 
that are now absolutely clean but not likely to get painted. I mean the 
inside of frame rails and such.

I hope to do this to my bus someday when it needs a better resto than we've 
given it this time.

I used to work in an antique car shop doing gofer work to pay for college. 
Saw a few cars that had been dipped and had rust coming through the paint a 
few years later.

What I don't know and would like to - what do you treat those hidden places 
with - Waxoyl?
