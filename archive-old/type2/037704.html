Subject: Re: stickers?

My fault entirely for letting this go so long. All 29 stickers HAVE BEEN
SENT (Monday morning) so it you don't get yours in a time you feel to be
reasonable please let me know (I saved four to hedge against the
efficiences of the United States Postal Service).

If you are they Australian guy for whom #30 is being saved, then pay up
because you are even slower than me and that is extra bad. =^ )

Thanks so much to all who donated. Newbies: these lists run out of a
dedicated server with very fat bandwidth. It costs $100/month to keep us on
the air. If you want to contribute, send mail to Steve Dolan
&lt;dworkin_at_type2_dot_com&gt; and he'll tell you how to pitch in.

The Original Official type2_dot_com window stickers are now originally
officially depleted and will not be re-run so don't ask me. =^ )

&gt;I can't remember who offered it, but a few months ago, someone said that the
&gt;first group of of folks to donate to the type2 cause would get one of the old
&gt;list stickers.
&gt;
&gt;I don't care, really - i'm happy to provide real monetary support for this
&gt;list and my check was in the mail before anything was said about the sticker,
&gt;but i got all stoked about getting one and just figured i'd ask.
