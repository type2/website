&gt; So, Richard and I ran through the
&gt; checklist again, and we discovered that I had simply forgotten to
&gt; install the non-resistor rotor.  &quot;Oops!&quot;  Pulled the old rotor,
&gt; installed the new non-resistor rotor, and the rich running condition
&gt; (actually &quot;incomplete burn due to weak spark condition&quot;) was gone.

To add to what Jason said, everything seems ok except the choke that Mallory
supplies to provide a tach/FI signal gets super hot and seems to be melting
it's casing.
