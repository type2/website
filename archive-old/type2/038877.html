Subject: Re: Stereo Wiring and Trailer hitches

One of the first things I did to my 76 bus after purchasing it in 88 was to 
rewire the radio independent of the ignition switch.There is a hot 12v line 
under the dash &quot;upstream&quot; of the ignition, and I simply moved the connection 
for the radio to that side of the switch. It's been 12 years now, and no 
problems. Same stock radio, am/fm, no tape. I did manage to break off my 
antennae, but having trouble finding a suitable replacement, I have 
temporarily installed a Radio Shack wire-in-scotch-tape antennae to the 
inside of the windshield. Not as pretty, but it gets the job done. 
 On another note, I keep a hump  caddy and a roller tray [used by painters] 
between my front seats. Holds coffee go cups, change, camera, glasses, etc 
where I can get at 'em without reaching, or even looking. And stuff doesn't 
roll around or get lost. 
But then, I don't have a Westy, I've  got  a thirty five year old Apache 
pop-top camping trailer, which is the next best thing. It's a westy without 
the engine.[Well, okay, sorta...] That way I can carry my canoe on top of the 
bus, and our bicycles on a double duty  hitch that I designed, that carries 
the bike rack  above the ball.
          x
    a __]L_o    'a' slips into the receiver,  ' x ' is where the rack bolts 
to the upright, 

and  'o'  is the trailer ball. I'm still fine-tuning the concept, but it 
works.
