Subject: Turn signals failure


	Now or course I checked the archives and know that this was on there
just a few weeks ago, but alas the cgi-script don't look like they are
completely up. 

	My turn signal/horn/high beams don't work at least not now, they used
to. Using the hazzard works just fine so there is power getting at least
to the bulbs. Is it a relay failure that causes this or was it some
other switch in the column. These are what I remember being some
possible solutions. If someone thinks it is a relay, a p/n would be
great. TIA and a pat on the back for our system admins.
