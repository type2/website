Subject: seeking fuel tank for '74 transporter

hey now my dearest Volks,

My '74 transporter has that age old problem of rust in her gas tank and
carbs.
I'm removing her old tank and instead of having it dipped, I am looking to
buy a new one if possible.

I've been looking everywhere but nobody seems to carry the early model
tanks.

If anybody can help, please drop me an email!

Peace and happy, smiling VW's
~Shannon~ and &quot;Buddy&quot; 1974 transporter bus
