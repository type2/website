In a 78 there is the bolt hole for shoulder straps at least on the
passenger side where it is not covered by the cabinet, pull an old set
of three point belts from a junker and mount them in. the hole is threaded
to accept the same bolts as hold the front belts in.

&gt; I am wondering if anyone has any solutions to the problem of not 
&gt; having rear shoulder belts in the older campers.
