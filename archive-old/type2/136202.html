Subject: winter oil weight (did i spell that right?)

hello everyone,
      i've checked the archive and my owner's manuel but oddly enough still have questions.  my comprehesion skills are not what they once were.  right now i am running valvoline 20w50 full synthetic in my 1975 type 4 bus engine with a 3 speed automic tranny.  on a recent trip from saint louis mo to colombia mo driving i drove at speeds, according to my speedometer, of 65 to 70 mph.  at these speeds my oil pressure gauge(VDO)never dropped below 50 psi.  i have no reason to doubt the truthfullness of this gauge though the fledgling american government had no reason to doubt aaron burr either.  that bastard.  the oil temp gauge read between 180 and 212 predomintly (sp).  i have good reason to doubt this gauge.  don't ask why.  all i can say is that when i ask it a question it can never look me in the eyes when it answers.  also, the ambiant atmoshpere was wet and rainy with a temp in the 40's F.  is the oil pressure acceptable?  should i switch to a 10w30 syn. or a 15w40?  thanks in advance for any and all sage and insightful(l) or anecdotal advice.  not that anecdotal advice can't also be sage and insightful....
