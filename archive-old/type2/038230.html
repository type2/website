Subject: Wiper Switch Wiring URGENT!

Volks;
I'm leaving tomorrow for a long trip. Trying to get the bus ready I
pulled and lubed the wiper assembly.  In my haste I lost my wiring
tags(I'm a double dumb-ass, don't ask).  The particulars are:
71 Westy
6 wires total
Black to fuse box
Brown (I'm assuming switch ground..it's two wire on a single connector)

4 coming from wiper motor
Brown
Black
Black w/Yellow
Black w/Purple

I have the black from the fuse box connected at the top of the switch.
The brown (not from wiper motor, the other one) is on the inset prong,
driver's side.  There are 4 prongs remaining top and bottom on both the
driver and pass side of the switch. I have a wiring diagram but I can't
read the terminal designations on the switch.

Could someone go spy the wires/switch and help me get my wipers going
again?  I expect rain on my trip tomorrow.

Thanks for your help

Shawn Clark 
71 Westy
