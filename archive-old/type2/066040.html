&gt; Hi there.

&gt; I'd like to say thanx to everyone that helped diagnose my
&gt;  problem with poor idle in the morning.  
&gt; 
&gt; I think I corrected the problem last nite.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Memo to myself: when rebuilding carb, remember to make sure
&gt; the automatic choke thingy is hooked onto the rod doohickey.&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; This helps immensely.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, this VW experience is supposed to be a learning thing,
&gt; right?  Well, I'm learning.  (Slowly)

Murphy's law states that if there is anything to be learned from a 
particular experience, it will usually be very early in the morning when 
you finally experience SATORI,  at least 10 hours than you counted on.
