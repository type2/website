Subject: Re: Plug Socket, Dist, Points

Even a dedicated spark plug socket sometimes won't hold the plug as 
securely as you'd like, especially as the rubber insert ages.  I usually 
put a couple of short strips of masking tape over the end of the socket 
and down an inch or so into the &quot;well&quot; of the socket.  This takes up just 
enough room in the socket to provide a snug fit with the plug.  You might 
try that with your deep socket instead of buying another tool.

&gt;&gt; However, it sounds like you need to buy a spark plug socket.  There are 
&gt;&gt; sockets specifically made for removing and installing spark plugs. They 
&gt;&gt; have a rubber insert inside that grabs the plug and keeps it from 
&gt;&gt; falling out of the socket.  You will not be able to re-install them 
&gt;&gt; (well, you might be able to if you are very patient and creative) unless 
&gt;&gt; you are using a spark plug socket.  Hopefully you have another ride to 
&gt;&gt; the tool store :-)
