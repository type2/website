I just got a T3 sunroof model, Florida car, body is great except for the 
sunroof. It was siliconed up when I got it, and as I cut the headliner 
open- big piles of rust fell on my head. Both drain channels are completely 
rusted through- although there is no rusty spots on the floor- cause the 
next thing I did was pull all the carpet and padding. (Whew). Anyway,I've 
got a great van except for the sunroof issue. The sunroof is 45&quot;x45&quot;. I've 
called around to possibly find a pop-up replacement- but no such luck. I am 
pondering the idea of putting a poptop on it because the roof is solid, 
only the underskin and waterchannels are shot.

 1. Does anyone have the dimensions of the 64-67 poptop (little cube one 
that pops straight up) handy.
 2. Does anyone know where one is located, or would part with one if they 
have 6 or 7 in their garage ?
 3. I think Sportsmobile made a cube popup thru 70 something- maybe this 
would work also.

My other alternative is (gulp) Plexiglass...
Any wisdom from the masses.

Signed wet&amp;rusty head.
