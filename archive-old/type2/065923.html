Subject: KYB thoughts

Since KYB's are generally the shock absorber of choice, I thought I'd
relate my recent (not-so-impressive) experience with the things.  Over
the summer my '65 developed a squeak on the right front side when I
hit a bump.  I greased the suspension thoroughly, but it wouldn't go
away.  The shocks (KYBs, installed by a PO) had been feeling worn
anyway, so I sprung for new ones (again, KYB Gas-A-Just, since that's
what everyone I talked to recommended).  The squeak promptly went away
- - apparently it was in the shock!  A week later, I left beautiful
Oregon for Pennsylvania.  The drive went great, the bus performed like
a champ the whole way, with some prodding on my part, of course.

Fifty miles after I crossed into PA, I hit a pretty hefty pothole
(lousy crappy PA roads..grr..), and what happened but the exact same
squeak is back!  Granted, it was a pretty big hole that I shouldn't
hit at 50 mph, but on the other hand a shock as expensive as the KYB
with less than 3000 miles on it should be able to handle one or two
big jolts, wouldn't you think?

So I dunno, so far I'm not too impressed with the KYB Gas-A-Just
shocks.  Any better ideas?  Maybe I should just put junky low-budget
brand ones on there, so I won't care as much if they start squeaking
and bouncing around after only a few thousand miles.

Anyone know if KYB has a guarantee of some sort?  I don't have the
original packaging anymore...
