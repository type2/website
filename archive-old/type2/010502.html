Hello all, I am in need of a trailer hitch for the Mothership.  If anyone 
has one laying around they want to rid themselves of please let me know.  
We will discuss the arrangements.

For those of you who like to paddle and frolic in the water like I do, 
and have been searching for that perfect boat.  I have become a dealer 
for what I think is the ultimate bus boat.  Check it out at 
www.kiwikayak_dot_com.  If ya want to know prices or other information drop 
me a line.  I will give list members a 10% discount off the retail price.

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
