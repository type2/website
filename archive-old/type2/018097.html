Subject: Re: would 009 diz cause a '77 too run hotter than a stock diz?
Message-ID: &lt;37456590.B16F0D59_at_harmon.bml_dot_usouthal_dot_edu&gt;

      No, the 009 dizzy would not cause it to run too hot, although it
could be that the timing is set too far advanced, which would cause
heat, but that's not likely as the problem with using a 009 with a T4
engine is that the 009 does not advance nearly far enough. What does
your timing light say?
