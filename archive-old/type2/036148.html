Subject: Re: Cross drilled brake rotors

While I have never cross drilled rotors I have slotted
them! Cross drilling remove too much needed thermal
mass. A heavy bus needs all the thermal mass reserve
it can get. Slotting removes less. And it causes less
wear problems for the pads. The trick is in making the
slots with a rounded bottom and chamfered edges. Once
you have a fixture to hold the rotor in a milling
machine its easy to do.

Another way to have better brakes is to upgrade to
latter (better) years parts. My 75 bus has factory
front rotors but 82 vanagon rear drums.  They are self
adjusting and by definition always in correect adjustment.
