Subject: Re: [VB] Which clutch &amp; TO to use??

If the to bearing is the early style you need the clutch with the ring on it 
to match.  otherwise it makes a horrible noise when you step on the clutch, 
and I guess will eat up the TO bearing.    I like the 9 spring clutches.  Feels 
better to me.  Think they cost more, but worth it.  I am assuming the tranny 
IS original and clearanced for 12V FW.   BTW, good time to check/replace teh 
starter bushing, and greas eup that clutch cable threads/make sure teh wingnut 
spins so you can adjust your clutch easily when the motor is in.

I have a 67 bus that has the original 67 transmission
in it.  The replacement engine I have to put into this
bus is an AE code case 1600 DP (all the info I've
found tells me this is a 71 engine)
I know that after 70, the clutch pressure plate and TO
bearing changed, right?? So to mate up a 67 tranny to
a 71 engine, which clutch &amp; TO bearing should I use,
for a 67 or for a 71?? 
My instinct tells me that i should use the later
clutch to match up with the later engine, But I want
to be sure.
