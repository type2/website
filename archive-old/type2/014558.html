Hello everyone!

     I found some longer wheel studs for my bus at my flaps. Cost me
$2.25 Ea. Only thing is, I'll have to have my hubs drilled a bit bigger
then press the new studs in. the studs are a bit bigger where they are
pressed in the hub, but there a 14mm x1.5 thread. I'm going to try to
find another set of hubs, so I can keep the originals, that way if I
ever sell my bus I can put it back to original. And keep my nice alloys.

     I also found a set of nice original chrome bumpers, off of a 79'
champaign ed. bus. They even have the impact strips in good shape. 
     I'll have to get some pictures when finished!

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
