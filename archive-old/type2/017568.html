Subject: Brake Resevoir Connector Piece
Message-ID: &lt;37050690Brake Resevoir Connector Piece*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;He discovered a leak and decided to rebuild the master cylinder but 
discovered that the
&gt;leak is coming from a piece of rubber hose (?) that connects the brake-fluid
&gt;reservoir to the master cylinder. He said that it is a part that is no 
longer available
&gt;&gt;from his usual parts supplier. 

I had this problem two weeks ago.

&gt;does anybody know what this part is called

Hose, Brake Fluid, German, 7mm I.D. X 1meter or 2 meter
(from resevoir to master cylinder)   

&gt;or even a part number and
&gt;better still where we can get one. 

 N 020 350 1/1M  (or) N 020 350 1/2M
p. 150, Rocky Mountain Motorworks Catalog # 9902, 1-800-258-1996

However, I never ordered this so i can't confirm how accurate it is. I wasn't 
satisfied with placing an order because my original 
appeared to have rubber seals in either end of the hose, to assure no leakage 
of fluid out and Air in, they didn't know about or 
have those seals, and their used division was reluctant to sell used seals 
obviously, plus not worth it for them to cannibalize 
their buses for that. 

What I did was verify that the line itself wasn't leaking, just the ends 
where it met the resevoir and master cylinder because the 
original seals were shot, so I went to the foreign auto parts store around 
the corner from me, to the Red &quot;Help&quot; section in aisle 
three, usually one of those racks that you spin, and found a black plastic 
radiator connector, basically a plastic hose junction
used for joining two hoses of different diameter, bought if for 3 bucks. 
First I disconnected the line at the master cylinder, pulled it
up so the other end hugged the resevoir nice and tight, then hose clamped 
(plastic hose clamp if possible) then I made sure my 
junction was the right size (small end goes inside the master cyl  port, 
larger end inserts in end of the hose. Then you have to cut 
a good inch off the small end of the junction you buy so the line isn't 
pushed back to point of being kinked. I also shaved a little 
off the length of the hose to accomodate the length of the juncture. fit is 
all in with a couple of hose clamps, fill up the resevoir and
bled the brakes, drove it etc., and it hasnt' leaked yet. good luck
