Fred and list,

I wanted to thank you publicly for the effort you made to make various type
2 manuals available to us all by scanning them and posting on thesamba web
site. I hope I will eventually have the opportunity to also help a fellow
type2er out in my own way.  That's what sharing a hobby should be about.
