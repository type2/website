Subject: Re: BA6 gas heater fumes

 
I'm glad there is a simple solution to this.... or is there? 

I guess I'll check with a VW dealer to see if they can supply it ...or is
 there some other source for the pipe?

Ahhhh, yes Gary,............ Kick 'em when they're down.
You couldn't have picked a better time to post this I guess...........

Anyway, Yes, your heater is a BA6, and maybe the fumes you're getting are
because your gas heater exhaust pipe has rusted off.  The exhaust is supposed to
exit at the side or rear - not under the center of the van due to a improperly
maintained system. I'm sure you have replaced your Van's engine exhaust
components at least  2 or 3 times since it was new in '82.  The gas heater
should have regular maintenance intervals too. A properly maintained gas heater
will not emit fumes. 
And No, gas heaters are not designed as &quot;transmission warmers&quot;.
And about your question, do they rust - Personally I have never seen a rusty BA6
shell, and I have pulled a real solid one off a really rusty '77 westy, as I
believe the outer shell on some ( correct me if I'm wrong ) - is stainless.  it
also adds to their longevity if you keep the factory bellypan cover in place. 

So, replace that exhaust pipe there, and get it tuned up (new plugs etc) and
like any other mechanical part, get it serviced regularly so it doesn't get this
bad again.
