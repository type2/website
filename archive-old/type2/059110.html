	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

OK how about location on front doors of a '71 (truck that is) no damn
sliding door and the side hatches show nada.  Unfortunately left the door
keys in a hotel in the heartland on the way back from St. Louis and are
irretrieveable.  Mind you answering the question I CAN NOT remove the front
cylinders because I have no key.  I've removed the handles and looked them
over thouroughly and attempted to pick the locks (I'm not that good.)  Am I
SOL or not, hell I got blanks, I got a key machine (dad bought it in the
70's, can make keys for most any 70's vintage car if anyone needs
something), I know how to rekey the damn things anyway, but I don't see
anyway to get the cylinder out without destroying the handles which happen
to be an uncorroded and very nice set.  Plus it doesn't appear possible to
remove the cylinders and rekey the side hatch locks period unless I am being
obtuse.  Anyone HELP.
