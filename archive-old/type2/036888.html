Subject: 72 whoosh sound near cylinder 3 -PLEASE HELP!!!!!

 hey all, 
     my 1700 has a whoosh sound coming from the # 3 cylinder.  i can hear it 
when i turn the engine over manually and when she starts.  also after 
starting it will idle high for a few seconds, then slow down, then speed up 
again until it finally dies.  please help.
