Importance: Normal
Subject: Clutch Plate

More questions...my engines is out and the clutch is apart.  My &quot;clutch
failure&quot; was actually due to a melted pilot bearing which sort of welded the
input shaft to the crankshaft.  I noticed the input shaft has a little bit
of radial play...is this normal or acceptable?  The tranny worked fine prior
to clutch problem.

Also, my clutch plate looks ok but is worn to about 2/16&quot; above the rivets.
The book says the minimum is 1/16&quot;  I can't find a spec for what a new
clutch plate would have.  Should I buy a new clutch plate?  How much life
might be left in my old clutch plate?
The flywheel and pressure plate look and feel smooth...is it good practice
to re-use these parts based on smoothness?

thanks,
RickG
