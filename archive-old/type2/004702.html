Hello,
     My wife has a 74 westy.  I gave up on smogging it two years ago when it
required new egr's that were out of production.  I have most of the required
smog parts, even a functional  smog-pump pully drive system.  Has anyone put
the egr's for this vehicle back on the market.  Mary loves her bus.  I have
told her that it can live in the back yard till 2003 when it becomes exempt
&gt;from California smog inspections.  I already have a set of baby webbers and
manifolds for it.  If anyone has ideas on how to get this bus back onto the
road before the new milenium send me a note.
    Thanks in advance,
        Dave West
