Subject: wired open heater boxes

Hi All,

First, I just want to thank all of you who have so patiently answered my 
questions as I rebuild my bus.

I'm getting ready to put my engine back in the bus, and I remember when I 
took it out, the heater boxes were wired to the frame in the open position.  
Why would the previous owner(s) do this?  Are hooking them back up to the 
dash levers a difficult job?

thanks!
