Recent discussion on the lists about the new book on VW's Nazi past
suggested that quite a few of us drivers of &quot;Hitler's Revenge&quot; are a bit
guilty about that part of our cars' history.

As a means to assuage some of that guilt, why don't y'all add your names to
the list of people who don't want latter-day Nazis promoting their filthy
ideas on the Net.

&gt;Forwarded message follows :
&gt;
&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt;I'm sending a message I got, please vote NO (if you agree) and also send
&gt;it out to as many people as you can
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A group of NEO-NAZIS are trying to form a newsgroup on Usenet called
&gt;&quot;rec.music.white-power&quot;, so that they can get their message of hate out
&gt;to young people using the Internet.
&gt;Newsgroups are public discussions on the Internet and their formation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;requires enough support from the Internet community.
&gt;
&gt;EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US HAS ONE VOTE when it comes to creating a new
&gt;Usenet group.  I hope you will vote NO and thereby tell these NAZIS we
&gt;don't want their stuff on the net. Below is the procedure, please repost
&gt;this plea and get the NO vote out.  If you want to see the official call
&gt;for votes, you can try on &quot;news.group&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;DO NOT VOTE TWICE - that would constitute voting fraud.
&gt;
&gt;HOW TO VOTE:
&gt;
&gt;     Send e-mail (posts to newsgroups are invalid) to:
&gt;
&gt;       music-vote_at_sub-rosa_dot_com
&gt;    This is an impartial, third party vote taker.
&gt;     Please check the address before you mail your vote. Your mail
&gt;     message,  to be accepted by the counting computer,  must
&gt;     contain only the following statement with no signature:
&gt;
&gt;      I vote NO on rec.music.white-power
&gt;
&gt;     Vote counting is automated.  Failure to follow these directions may
&gt;mean that your vote does not get counted.  If you do not receive an
&gt;acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the  votetaker
&gt;about the problem.  It's your responsibility to make sure your vote is
&gt;registered correctly.
&gt;
&gt;Here's what Canada's George Burdi, of the neo-Nazi Heritage Front, had to
&gt;say about this vote, on February 21, on his RESISTANCE mailing list:
&gt;
&gt;   &quot;There is a call for votes coming on rec.music.white-power in the next
&gt;week or so, and you will be notified in a special issue of RREN exactly
&gt;what to do.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER.  Let me be perfectly
&gt;blunt and state that we have more than enough net-nazis to win this thing
&gt;handsdown. But every  one of you must vote YES!  And just voting yes
&gt;means nothing  unless you do it properly.  So you have   been forewarned.
&gt;The instructions are coming to your email  box soon, and they are not
&gt;complicated.  Just follow them as told, and we will have a WP music
&gt;newsgroup
&gt;finally!&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If Mr. Burdi's confidence disturbs you, please give this letter the
&gt;widest possible distribution, and help us deliver the largest NO vote in
&gt;the history of the UseNet.
&gt;
