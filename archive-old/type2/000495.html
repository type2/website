Hi,

Let's cut to the chase. 1-7/8&quot; is the closest available SAE size that is
easily obtainable..The sockets are available at SEARS stores on the
helf( or rather behind the glass.) I would strongly suggest that get a 3/4&quot;
drive if you are serious about removing the nut without snapping tools.

You will also need to get something to drive the socket with. I suggest the
3/4&quot; sliding T-bar. You should be able to get the socket and the sliding T
bar for a little under $40.

I would also STRONGLY suggest you head down to the local hardward store and
get a 5' or 6' foot length of cast iron pipe that will slip over the T-bar.
This will give you the leverage you need to remove an overtorqed bolt.

As an alternative, I have a freind that uses an 18&quot; long crescent wrench
(these are a bit cheaper and more widely available) with the 6' length of
pipe and has had great success removing the 46mm bolts.

Chris
