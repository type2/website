Subject: Re: starting problem

Kim and Mike,
i dont know whether or not you guys tried this yet or
not, or if its a permanent fix, but i had the same
problem and ever sinced i installed a small relay its
always started since.   the info below is from th type
2 library that i copied and pasted:

Relay Installation Instructions


The idea here is to introduce a relay into the
starting circuit to lessen the chances of your bus not
starting when it's hot. Picture the path the current
from the battery must take to start your bus: From the
battery all the way up to the fuse box, through the
ignition switch, and all the way back to the solenoid.
You've got 20 yr old wires, dirty corroded
connections, and a hot solenoid, ensuring that you
definitely won't get enough juice to start the car.
What the relay does is start your car every time
because it doesn't take much current at all to trip
the headlight relay and then the headlight relay makes
the solenoid connection, sending juice directly from
the battery to the starter and you start every time! 

Supplies needed: 1 generic headlight relay, the kind
with four terminals (3 terminals if the relay grounds
through its attachment bracket) rated for about 30
amps or so. Mine was found at a parts store, made by
NightBlaster for use with their fog lights. Get the
kind that has a metal mounting bracket, as you will
probably need to bend and plastic does not bend well.
Mine cost a couple bucks. I have heard that Bosch also
makes a relay kit for this purpose, the WR-1 I
believe. 

A hacksaw: you will probably need this to hacksaw part
of the screwhole out on the relay's mounting bracket,
but depending on where you mount it, you may not have
to do this. 

A spool of 10-gauge wire. You probably won't need too
much, i got an 8-ft spool because that was the
smallest size they had and I had plenty left over, but
hey, never know when that will come in handy. 

Some smaller gauge wire, to run for the relay ground
connection (if necessary). 

Wire connectors: Get the kind that are big enough for
10-gauge wire (you know, the crimp-on connectors). You
will need both push-on type and ring type. Get a box
of each, they come in handy too. Also get some smaller
gauge type connectors for that ground wire, get
whatever kind you need to attach to a ground. 

Wire stripper, other tools. 

OK, here's what you do: 

1) DISCONNECT THE BATTERY. Don't screw around with
your starter with the battery connected. Death or
serious injury follows when you accidentally short the
connections and the starter cranks the bus which you
left in gear and it promptly runs you over because
you're laying right in front of the wheel. 

2) You may want to jack up the bus a little, might
help you reach. Look on your starter. You will see one
of the post connectors, terminal 30, has a bunch of
wires going to it, big fat ones. This post gives you
your direct connection to the battery. Take the 13mm
nut off the end and cut an appropriate length of
10-gauge wire (depends on where you mount the relay, I
mounted mine on the starter using the starter screws,
you will see when you're under there). Put a ring type
connector on one end and a push-on on the other end.
Make sure the connections are good, or one day your
bus will not start. do it right the first time. Put
the ring connector onto terminal 30 and put the
push-on onto the terminal on the relay that is the
power input. 

3) Put the 13mm nut back on terminal 30, you're done
there. Now, pull the wire from the ignition switch off
of the solenoid. Fuel injected buses have two wires up
there, the Idiot book has a nice picture of which one
is ignition and which is fuel injection. I think the
thicker one is ignition, but I won't swear to it.
Anyway, take the ignition switch wire off and put it
on the relay terminal for switch current. this is what
will activate the relay. 

4) Make up another 10-gauge with a push-on on both
ends, one end goes on the power output terminal on the
relay and the other end goes on the ignition terminal
on the solenoid, the one you took the wire off of in
step 3. 

5) Those are your connections, that's all there is to
it. Now, you want to make sure you figure out where to
mount the relay before you do all this so you can
decide whether hacksawing is necessary. Some folks
mount it in the engine compartment, but it's tough to
find a good path for the wire up through the engine
tin. I mounted mine on the starter and had to bend the
bracket a little to make it right. It's up to you. 

5.5) Forgot this earlier, but if you have to run a
ground connection, now's the time to do it. Get out
your ground wire and put a push-on on one end and a
suitable connector for wherever you will be grounding
on the other end. I grounded mine on a spare bolt that
was on the frame somewhere, look around and you'll
find a place. 

6) Check every now and then to make sure your
connections stay corrosion free and all that. Enjoy
your starting. 

peace,

&gt; Hello All!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having a starting problem.  My lights are on on
&gt; the dash board and
&gt; headlights are bright as can be. I just get the
&gt; click sound.
&gt; 
&gt; Alright so now the screwdriver trick which always
&gt; starts it.  Nope. 
&gt; 
&gt; So I do the 3rd gear backwards trick to see if its
&gt; stuck.  Nope. 
&gt; 
&gt; Clean all connections to started/solenoid/battery
&gt; and tighted
&gt; all the bolts back up.  Including the two on the
&gt; starter that hooks onto the 
&gt; body.  TrY to start.  No Go.  Just the click.
&gt; 
&gt; So then we jump the battery and still no.  just the
&gt; click.  So obviously its 
&gt; the starter motor. 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, so then we push start it and it goes.  Drive it
&gt; around a little shut it
&gt; down.  Try to start it again and it starts.  And its
&gt; been starting ever
&gt; since.  Until it gets moody again.
&gt; 
&gt; so what is it??
&gt; Just a bad part in the starter motor.  It is only a
&gt; year old.
&gt; Solenoid-would've started with the screwdriver
&gt; Battery - wouldv'e started with the jump start.
&gt; Switch - Would've started with the screwdriver.
&gt; 
&gt; -Is there anything else I can check?
&gt; -Is the relay hook up just basically the screwdriver
&gt; trick?
&gt; -Has anyone else had to replace a starter this
&gt; often?(we've replaced   it 
&gt; twice in the last 5 years)
&gt; 
&gt; I read in the idiots guide that
&gt; something(pinion?bushing? needs to be
&gt; greased could this be it.  maybe its just sticking?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
