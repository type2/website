Subject: Tiny female connectors

I had much difficulty in finding these when I was wiring my glowplugs
in my TD conversion.

my local NAPA carries replacment connectors for OEM connections but not
identical to the Tiny female spades.. 

I used a small female end from a FORD wiring part, it's a square
looking end, but the connection is SPADE so worked well.
were &amp;.70/ea  so 10 was a little pricey for the size baggie I bought..
LAMO-shack was and still is of barely no use unless I wanted to buy a
cell phone.
