Volks,

Bluto the bus is now sporting four new tires, and I am pleased with the 
results.  First, I appreciate all of the feedback from everyone.  It was 
useful and based on it I changed my mind more than once.  What I finally 
settled on though was the Discount tire house brand tire (Trailfinder) in 
27x8.5x14C.  This tire has a less aggressive tread design than the BFG 
Offroad TA but still a M+S design which should do okay in adverse 
conditions.  The ride is significantly improved.  They are also very quiet, 
and handling, while not as crisp as with the old tires, is more than 
acceptable.  With 40lbs in the front tires (45 rear) steering effort is 
relatively light.  There are no clearance problems with these tires at 
all.  There could be an issue with chains on the front wheels, but since I 
don't live in Alaska that's not important to me.  I do have a set of 
low-profile cable chains which I am pretty sure will clear the front wheels 
if necessary, but I haven't tried them yet.  This is a light truck tire 
with Load Range C, max load says 1515 lbs at 50psi cold.  With the safety 
margin built into light truck tires, the load rating should be more than 
adequate for my bus, which rarely sees more than 1100lbs on the heaviest 
wheel (yes, I have weighed them individually).  They have a 40,000 mile 
guarantee and I expect no problems getting that mileage from them.  I 
declined the $10-per-wheel road hazard - I'll take the gamble and if I end 
up having to buy a new tire, it will cost me about double what the road 
hazard warranty would have.  So I'm giving only 2 to 1 odds that I will not 
have an unrepairable flat, and I get to keep the money in the 
meantime.  Good deal.

The Yokohama Y356 185R14 D was tempting at $80/tire, in stock right in 
front of my eyes, but in the end the small size of the tire was just too 
uncomfortable for me.  Seeing them next to the Trailfinders was eye-opening 
- they looked like bicycle tires.  The Trailfinders look like they were 
made for the bus - not too big or goofy looking.  If anyone would like to 
see them at Everybus, just stop by the blue '73 highroof!  We leave in six 
hours...

-David

&gt;George is correct about the load bearing capacity of the Kirkland tires.
&gt;They're rated in the mid-1400 lb. range as I recall.
&gt;
&gt;What's even more unsettling is that COSTCO stocks and sells these
&gt;specifically as their &quot;Vanagon&quot; tire, and as such they sell them in large
&gt;numbers for installation on both Type 2s and Vanagons.
&gt;
&gt;I've had a couple of pretty serious go-rounds with COSTCO &quot;tire specialists&quot;
&gt;regarding these tires and their unsuitability for Type 2s, let alone
&gt;Vanagons, to no avail.  I'm a loyal COSTCO shopper, but at least in the tire
&gt;department they are doing a major disservice to their members.
