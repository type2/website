Subject: burning oil

We pulled the 1600DP last month to find the source of an oil leak that was
getting embarassing at the parking lot and to replace the muffler. We found
the valve cover gaskets were brittle and the telltale stain flowing from
them suggests that this might be our only trouble.

We started the engine on a test stand today and almost immediately, lots of
white smoke came from the tail pipes and continued for the 30 minutes we
ran the engine. I was hoping that this was just burnoff from the new
muffler.

Before pulling the engine, we measured 120 - 125 compression in all
cylinders.  After the smoke, we measured as low as 95 in two cylinders.
Squirting oil into a cylinder would boost compression to 140-150.

Total changes made between compression measurements:
        set valves to .004
        replace valve cover gaskets
        new muffler
        change oil to 25W-50

My questions are:
        1.Am I missing a possible source for the smoke other than the
obvious one that the rings are bad?
        2. I have other engines with compression as low as 90. I wonder why
these don't smoke?
        3. Why could my compression have dropped during the month that the
engine was idle on the test stand?

Thanks, Jack
