Subject: My van is eating batteries - solved

I posted a couple of months ago that my van appeared to be eating
batteries. They would be fine for 3-6 months and then not seem to hold a
charge no matter how long I charged them for. I checked for shorts but
found none.

Well, I took the latest one back to Halfords to claim on the guarantee
(again) and this time they tested it. They claimed it wasn't getting a
proper charge and I need a new charger. Obviously I thought they just
wanted to sell me one so I took my battery away again. Needless to say I
went and bought a new charger from a little motoring shop. Bright red and 6
amps it said on the cover. It looks like a proper old-fashioned charger
anyway with the added safety feature of a cutout so I could put the charge
on and forget about it.

Anyway, I charged my battery over a month ago and everything has been fine.
No problem starting in the morning even when Ashley has not been driven for
a week.

So it looks like battery chargers don't last forever. I'm sure the
electrical experts can explain this better than I can. I'm just posting
this so if anyone has similar symptoms they might find this is the fix.
