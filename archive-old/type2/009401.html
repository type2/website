Subject: Permanent remote starter button
Message-Id: &lt;199905151318.GAA27721_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

On my old MG, there was a starter button permanently wired in to the 
starter circuit and mounted in the engine compartment. It has been a long 
time, but I am pretty sure it was stock.

If ever a vehicle needed a remote starter switch, a VW transporter is 
that vehicle. The only danger to having one would be using it when the 
ignition is off. But I think that would be easy to deal with: just put a 
lightbulb on the oil warning switch circuit. The light would tell you 
when you have the ignition on (and remind you to turn it off) and it 
would also go out when the engine is running and has pressure (or not go 
off if no pressure).

So the only remaining question is: what kind of light? And should it be 
tapped in in parallel or in series? Seems like an LED would be adequate 
and could go either way without compromising the stock warning light in 
the dash?
