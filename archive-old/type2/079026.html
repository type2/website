&gt; I'm unhappy with the filters that are recommended for a Type IV engine, so I

&gt; Questions:  Will this create too much drag for the basic-type electric fuel
&gt; pump with presumed 5-10 psi?  Optimal place for a filter before or after the
&gt; pump(yes I know I asked this question before but I forgot the answer)?

A larger filter should create less resistance than a small one, since it
has more filtering area.
