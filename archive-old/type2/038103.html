Subject: '79 Westfalia Questions

My wife and I have been monitoring this list since signing up a couple of
weeks ago, and have learned many things.  Most importantly, the value of the
Articles, Archives and TEK sites for answers.  I downloaded the electrical
diagrams from the site, changed the suffix from &quot;.jpeg&quot; to &quot;.jpg&quot; and
printed them.  Many other mechanical and cosmetic questions I have had about
renovating our '79 Westfalia, have been answered.  However, I still have a
couple of questions not answered.

The water tank was butchered.  The fill neck was cut off about two inches
high.  The pump had broken off and all the plumbing was worn and leaking.  I
replaced all and jury-rigged the fill tube with the body of a 10&quot; long yard
sprinkler, bottom end cut off and insides removed.  It fits into the stub
neck nicley.  I glued a poker chip to the hole in the screw-on cap where the
pop-up sprinkler head came through.  What I need is a replacement water
tank.  It is &quot;h&quot; or chair shaped with a bottom mounted, external pump.  It
is thick-walled, white plastic.  Where can I find a replacement?  I have
checked gowesty_dot_com and busdepot_dot_com as well as several VW oriented shopping
centers (junkyards).  Any other suggestions?  Also, the camper had a small
table in it, with a center post and two &quot;catches&quot; on one side.  What does it
hook to or where does it hook?  It also had two pipe clamps on the left side
of the sink/stove console, for a swing arm and another table.  I found a
replacement swing-arm and a large table in a VW shopping center in Hesperia
CA.

The machine runs beautifully (rebuilt motor last year), and even passed the
emmissions check this year (Maricopa County AZ has some of the strictest
standards in the country) thanks to a great mechanic at Chuck's VW, in
Phoenix.  In the six years we have had the camper, it has made 20-25 round
trips between our home in Phoenix and various places in southern CA, and
down the coast of Baja a half dozen times on camping trips on the beach (it
is my wife's plaything and she and her friends are the one's traveling in
it).  Our grandchilden (5 &amp; 13) think it is the best way to go fishing.
