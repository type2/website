Subject: Re: [T2] Defroster cable

 &gt;The housing was broken on my cables too.  I used cables meant for the
rear flapper boxes, but trimmed them to length (and bent the trimmed
ends appropriately).  The end of the cables that attach to the levers
 &gt;was the same for both levers (heat on/off and defrost/floor)

I did this too and it worked a treat. the only problem was that the 
original cable housing was thicker so I had to pack it a bit where it 
attached near the footwell vents (the other cable was ok).

Cheers,

Martin.
