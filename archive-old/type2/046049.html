Subject: [T2] Which distributor for FI is best?

Hello List,

I recently converted my 76 Westy from dual Dellortos, to single Weber, and
now to stock fuel injection.  I had the Pertronix electronic ignition and a
centrifugal advance distributor with the Weber and everything worked great.
I've had good luck with FI on other busses and wanted to convert before
winter when carbs are more problematic.  When I installed the fuel injection
I retained the centrifugal distributor and Pertronix and my bus cut out,
carbon tracked the distributor, and ran very very lousy.  I know the ECU
needs a good consistent pulse from the coil so I removed the Pertronix and
installed points, new distributor and new rotor.  Now the bus runs much
smoother, but it has no power at all.  It runs fine on nice level road (it
really kicks ass going down hill), but it can barely drag itself up the
smallest of inclines.  My timing is set at about 12 degrees BTDC which is a
little advanced but it still does not help enough and I don't want to
advance it much more.  Now for my question....................Would I be
better off finding a stock vacum advanced distributor and using it?  I've
been told the vacum distributors produce less total advance and therefore
less high end speed and acceleration.  Are there any specific pros and cons
of which distributor works best with fuel injection?  I know &quot;stock&quot; usually
works best, but I would really appreciate specific advice or insight (with
big technical words that I have to look up in my Bentley).    

Thanks,
