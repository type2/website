&gt; I was putting in the new Robert Bosch spark plug wires yesterday.
&gt; I nicked one very badly and I nicked one just a bit. The other just
&gt; slightly.
&gt;

Hi Alan,,, sorry to hear about your luck,, darn.    You could get some
rubber vulcanizing tape from the plumbing section at walmart.. I think
plumbers use it for fixig leaks,...   but you know ,,, the reason plug wires
are replaced is to keep the spark inside them,, and when the insulation
deteriates or gets cut,, the spark can get out.   I always say,, don't get
any of those sparks on your fingers... lol, it will make you do the electic
dance !

I think the best thing you can do is get another set.. ,,,  you will be
happier in the end.

hope that helps

Jamie Rivers
