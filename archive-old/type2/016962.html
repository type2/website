Subject: 1970 Single cab info needed

As of this past friday, I am the owner of a 1970 Single cab. I spent the
weekend working on it. This is my first Bay window bus so as time goes
by I have more and more questions.  Here are a few.  Hope you don't
mind................
M-Tags... Is the format the same as the splits ?   Is there a web site
with all the tag info ?
Is there a site for Color codes ?

Is there a Bay window Single cab registry ?

What is a good highway tire size for the stock motor?

Does anyone have a Owners manual for Sale ?  Was there a manual for
&quot;Transporters &quot; only?

Thank you
Paul , Athens, Ohio (Bay newbie )
ps Any other Bay Single Cab owners .. Please feel free to write back to
me any time
