Subject: White mosquito netting available, and early Vanagon Dash Consoles
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I just received a bunch of white netting that is similar to the original Westy
netting used in poptops and tents.  The difference is that the new stuff has a
tighter weave than what is in my '74 Campmobile. This netting would look great
in your poptop and some of you may own a Westy tent that needs the screen
repaired.  I don't have cost on this yet, and I will likely not be selling
this direct, but supplying to other vendors.  As far as I know, there is no
source for white screening here in the US.  Reimo uses this netting in their
poptop canvas.

I still have a few of the dash consoles I ordered from Reimo in Germany.
These will fit '80 to '84 Vanagons.  I am selling these for $23 including
shipping.

For a pic of what they look like go to

It is upside down in the pic.

I also have a different and very nice dash console that fits the same years.
This takes up almost the entire dash and covers your ashtray and speaker
grille.  There is a space in the console where you can stick your ashtray.
There is room for 2 cups and a couple of slots for misc. stuff.  On the right
side there is a fold out map table.  The console is black and much more
substantial than the one above.  This unit will be about $65 plus shipping.  I
only have one, but will take orders and get as many as needed.
