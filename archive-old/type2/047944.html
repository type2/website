Well, the answer in my case is fairly short...  All of them :-)  I lost my
storage facility, and I still own 4 buses (buy my '78... PLEASE!!!), so if
I want them and I always do), then they have to be in the bus.  The other
reason is that the pervesity of the universe seems to dictate that (a) the
best way to need a tool is to leave it home and (b) the best way to make
the bus break down is to clean up and carefully stow all the tools in
their proper place.
