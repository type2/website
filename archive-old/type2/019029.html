Message-ID: &lt;381021F9.81D8EC12_at_istar_dot_ca&gt;

hello all,
i have a 75' camper westy, i was wondering if it is possible to remove
the poptop (only orig. roof showing) and install a sunroof off of a
doner bus or install some sort of ragtop (i think the sunroof and ragtop
are two different setups?) in the hole in the roof. anyone know how to
go about the whole deal? any online resources that document such
conversions? i have checked the archives too, didn't help in this case.
any advise or info would be greatly appreciated.
