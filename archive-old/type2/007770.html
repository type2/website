&gt; The lead makes the fuel/air mixture burn slower, which means that

&gt; it.  Someone back me up ... George?

What the lead does is lower the propogation speed of the flame front
as it moves across the top of the piston after the plug ignites the
mixture.  If the flame front goes too fast, the fuel tends to ignite
in multiple places in the combustion chamber, which creates the effect
known as preignition or &quot;ping&quot;.

Higher octane fuel ignites in a smooth progression across the cylinder
with less tendance for secondary ignition points.  This is much less
stressful on the engine.

Both fuels have virtually the same heat value, so they should give
equal performance and milage in an engine designed for the lower
octane fuel.

I tend to lean toward designing for lower octane fuels.  Octane
ratings haven't been going up in the last couple of decades and will
probably go down in the future.
