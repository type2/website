[...]  Well, excuse me for using 4 dots instead of 3.  This is one rule on
the list that really frustrates me.  I cut out 3/4 of the previous message,
but if my reply is short, I get this stupid message about excessive quoted
material.  Aarrgh. 

What I meant to say was -- Try replacing the condenser.

&gt; &gt; Hi and THANKS to everyone that has helped me in the quest to getting my 
&gt; &gt; 78 bus running.  Just one problem, its still not running.  It turns 
&gt; &gt; over and gets fuel but will not start, not even a putter.  I've tried a 
&gt; &gt; bunch of stuff, such as testing the FI, Starter, seloniod, distributor, 
&gt; &gt; spark plugs, combi-relay, compression test(on a cold engine) and some 
&gt; &gt; other smaller stuff.  Actually, My next step is to check the ignition 
&gt; &gt; switch.
