&gt; I just got done fixing the brake booster hoses on my

&gt; booster line are both 1/2&quot; (or whatever the metric
&gt; equivalent is) and the nipple from the manifold is
&gt; 1/8&quot;; no one either at the dealer (or the FLAPS) could
&gt; explain how to get from the big hose to the small hose;

You shouldn't have to!  My stock '71 has a large nipple coming out of
the center section of the manifold to the left of the carb.  Looks
like the manifold might have been replaced with a bug part.

There's no real magic to this port, as it's simply a connection to the
manifold for vacuum.  The stock one is simply a piece of tubing brazed
to the manifold.

I'd be worried about sufficient vacuum being available to the booster
for multiple applications of the pedal (such as if you want to pump
the brakes on slippary surfaces).  The first application would be
fine, but each application after that could be booster-less as the
small port wouldn't flow enough air to maintain the vacuum.

Remember, a 1/8 port has only 1/16 of the cross-sectional area of a
1/2 port, so it will only flow 1/16 as much air.  I suspect that there
was a good reason that VW went to the trouble of making a special
manifold with the large port.
