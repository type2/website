Here's a quick check for you. It's possible that the vacuum can in the
distributor is kaputt. Causing both a vacuum leak &amp; essentially a
mechanical only advance. Just disconnect the hose going to the
distributor &amp; plug it. Then hook another hose to the pot, connect the
timing light up &amp; start the engine. If it advances when you suck on
the hose you are probably ok, but if not Well that's something to look
at.
