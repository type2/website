Subject: The saga continues...

Well, I got up at &quot;God's own hour,&quot; as Steve puts it -- 7:30 a.m. Thanks to
the three junior high school girls outside my window chanting, &quot;Save the
bus! Save the bus!&quot;

I got a temporary registration sticker for the window of the bus.

But when I called the DOT to ask them to please refrain from towing my
now-legal bus, I had the pleasure of encountering the singularly unpleasant
Sgt. Martinez, who told me it is illegal to park in the alley and he can
tow my bus whenever he wants, registration or no, and he has &quot;operatives in
the field right now&quot; (I directly quote). I pointed out to him that this was
news to me, since in the three years I've lived here, this law has never
been enforced and cars are routinely parked in the alley. This did not earn
me points. Especially when I told him the LAPD told me they had no problem
with my having a non-operational bus in my alley, so long as it was legally
registered. Which it is now.

Interesting factoid: I had Wendelin parked snug up against my garage, in
the alley, for 2.5 weeks in July. No problem.

Thanks for listening,

Nikki
