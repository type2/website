Subject: Stud torque?

Hi All
	Just a quick engine rebuild question. I have a case, that had case saver
inserts put it before I got it. My machinist took all the case to head
studs out when he cleaned the case and got it prepped for a new bottom end.
I have the pieces parts together and I was wondering your opinions on
torque values for replacing them. See some of the inserts came out when he
took the studs out and some stayed in. I thought that they should never
come out, but the machinist who I've heard good things about (this is my
first rebuild) hasn't said anything about it, other than the case being a
good case with one or two more cycles left in it. What does the list say
about case stud replacment?

Thanks
