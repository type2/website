First, thanks to everyone that p/emailed on this.  The only missing
component is the wiring harness, and it is from a federal emissions (so
the 2nd one in the above list) bus.  I still haven't decided if I'm
going to take the plunge into FI.  I suspect if I asked the list if I
should keep on with the Weber 32/36 or go FI, the overwhelming majority
would say FI.  So, lets assume that's already happened. Be forewarned,
you'll probably get lots of &quot;where does this go&quot; and &quot;why doesn't this
do that&quot; questions as I climb the learning curve so many of you have
already traveled.  Now to convince my wife that this is a good way to
spend our money and my spare time :)
