&gt;     With the key &quot;ON&quot;,  check the wire to the sending unit with a volt
&gt; meter, (wire disconnected) you should have 10.0 to 10.5 volts with the key
&gt; on. If the voltage is correct, ground the wire and the gauge should read
&gt; &quot;full&quot;.  This will check the wiring, voltage stabilizer, and gauge, if it
&gt; shows &quot;full&quot;, then only the sending unit is left to be the trouble!
&gt;
&gt; VOLTAGE INCORRECT:
&gt;
&gt;     If the voltage is &quot;In-Correct&quot;, check the voltage Stabilizer behind
the
&gt; speedometer, going into the gauge. You should have battery voltage
available
&gt; (12.4 volts plus or minus) going in, and 10.5 coming out going into the
&gt; gauge. If not replace the stabilizer and recheck.
&gt;
&gt; VOLTAGE CORRECT:
&gt;
&gt;     If the voltage going into the gauge is correct, and the gauge doesn't
&gt; read &quot;full&quot;, with the wire grounded, replace gauge, and recheck.
&gt;
&gt;     Sounds complicated but it isn't. The idea behind all this is, that if
&gt; there is not a fixed voltage going into the gauge, it would &quot;swing&quot; as the
&gt; available voltage changed. Such as at idle, high RPM's, or when you turned
&gt; on a high voltage consumer, headlamps for instance.
&gt;     Good luck.
