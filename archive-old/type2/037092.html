&gt; Hi,

&gt; I just had an alignment done on my '79 Camper at NTB. Though I gave them the Bentley for the specs, they used their computer's Vanagon settings (80-92).
&gt; Are the specs close enough or should I insist on having it redone according to Bentley specs?
&gt; It does not pull or anything but it does not feel totally right, either.
&gt; BTW, the alignment was done after a complete front end overhaul (new beam, balljoint, steering pin, and tie rod ends).

Since the front suspension of a Vanagon is completely different from your
'79 bus, I'd say that the Vanagon specs are inappropriate.

A good alignment shop should realize this.  The adjustment is so easy that
they have little excuse for not making it right.
