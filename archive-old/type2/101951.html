Subject: Re: [T2] FI fuel pump failing?

Hello Richard,

I am sorry, I did not see his first post but rather
his second. That was my fault. I thought his problem
was just fluctuating fuel pressure. After reading his
first post, my suggestions would not help. I don't
know what the problem is. Sorry for the waste in
bandwidth.

Have a great day!
