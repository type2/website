Although this is an air cooled list (and you didn't even mention 1 VW
air-cooled in your E-mail) I'll bite with a reply.

1.  VW are making money, that's what companies do.
2.  Eurovans are made with manual transmission
3.  Eurovans are made with syncro
4.  VW still makes Vanagons (in South Africa)
5.  If you want a no frills VW what about a brand new air-cooled
beetle 40%
of the cost of the rebodied Golf MK4 which they are selling as the
Concept1
Beetle?
