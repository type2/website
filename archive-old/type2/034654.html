Subject: CHT harness

Victor: I have been running cht gauges on my two 1600sp engines for several 
years. Yes, changing the length of the mfgrs wire harness will introduce 
errors. However, extending the harness the several feet you require should 
not make a radical error. If you could make the installation with the wire 
length provided you probably would not go to the trouble of precisely 
recalibrating the system anyway. My point is that you will use the system to 
obtain a relative indication and the extension of the harness will not 
seriously affect its utility. On my older engines which have no ports for 
insertion of thermocouples. I have attached ring type sensors (normally 
intended for attachment beneath a sparkplug) by gluing them to a flat surface 
on the engine case adjacent to the #3 cyl exhaust port with JBWeld. As a 
relative indicator it works great. Ray, 68 Campmobile, 69 Transporter
