Subject: Re: [T2] gas theft-siphoning trick

The hose is to drain the tank before doing fuel hose replacement, or 
siphoning lawn mower gas or when I had to rescue aother busser out of 
gas ...... (-8

  I keep a CLEAR tube about 6 ft long in the bus for this- tube tends to
  bend around in the tank and suck air- the trick is to feed it in as you
  BLOW through the other end until you hear bubbles-push in further
  (seeing that bubbles still sound-then suck until you see the gas and
  stick your finger over the end and place into receptacle.

quoth Tony in NJ:     Tune in next week when Mike tells us how to 
hotwire a Porsche... ;-)
