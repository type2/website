they are going after guys with VW shifter knobs and T-shirts, not so much as
PARTS.

It's crazy that they are going after guys that are supporting the VW hobby,
yet they not doing this to eliminate competition in a market that they are
competing in, or willing to START competing in. They are simply doing it to
be vindictive and &quot;protect&quot; their copyright.

I would have no problem with their actions if they were actually supporting
us, but they don't give a damn.
