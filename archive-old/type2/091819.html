Subject: pilot bearing

 Any thoughts on how to get the old one out?  I recently had my engine out
so replaced the clutch assembly as a matter of convenience and an oil soaked
disk.  The kit had a new pilot bearing, but as I did  not immediately see a
way  to remove the old one and it seemed clean and free, I just left it in
and put the new one away in a baggy.  Is this like the main seal in that you
just grab parts of it and pull the cage apart and take the needles out?  Old
one only has 87K on it.

&gt;OK, now I have the bentley and haynes manual and find
&gt;no mention of the pilot bearing.  is it called the
&gt;pinion in the bentley?  sounds like i should just go
&gt;ahead and try to find the thing myself

Most VW FLAPS have 'em, looks like a small needle bearing.  VW PN

It's located at the end of the flywheel side of the crankshaft
