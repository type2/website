	Hi listees.

Today something happened that will stay in my memories for a long time. 

	I was out in a neighbour town, Seinäjoki (find that on the map guys). I
was sort of window shopping for a newer car for my wife and my daughter.
For some reason both of them prefer low cars with four doors and a heating
system based on water circulation:-) While I was knocking suspicuously on a
1988 Passat something in the corner of my eye caught my attention.

	 It was like magnethic to my eyes, a blue panel van stood far back in the
in the big hall. I forgot about the Passat and my feet carried me straight
to the van. It looked so fresh! A 1973 Panel van. The dark blue paint was
just perfect and the open cargo door showed a totally clean cargo area.
This panel van was like brand new! And no wonder it looked good, the
odometer said 2375 km!

	Just when I was looking at the engine somebody said -Hrrrm, an older sales
man stood there looking suspicously at me: -It's not for sale.
 I explained to him about my daily driver and that I could not resist
taking a closer look at this perfect Van. When he heard about this he
suddenly changed, smiled when I was pointing at my '71 kombi standing
outside the window. 
He told me the van was ordered by somebody in 1973 who drove it only a 1000
kms before he died. The salesman is one of the owners of the dealership.
They bought the van back from the widow a few years later and they have
kept it since then. It has only been driven to the yearly safety inspection
and a few shows.

	He started the engine and I could hear what a  new factory installed
original engine sounds like! I sure felt like the eight year old boy I was
when this van was new! Like always when you meet bus people we talked bus
memories and experiences for a good while.

PS: Think i'm going to buy that Passat...

If freezing in a VW bus makes a man out of me,
-- What a MAN I am!
