Hey Guys   First there is probably two of them ,but I have seen  as many as 5
in a reman vw engine from the factory. They bwill probably end up  around the
oil strainer . They aren't very stout or very big.  You will  need new ones
in their place or the dizzy shaft might not  come up to the  dizzy and without
them you could cause premuture wearing of the case where the  shaft rides. I
would drain the oil and remove the screen and fish around with a  stick magnet.
I don't think you will find them thur the dizzy hole.  Later  Mark Dearing

I waited til Richard Carlton verified it but I said he has a 78 bus with a type 4 engine.

They only used one shim washer. Unlike a type 1 engine that needs 2 because of the magnesium case.

If you go to the Samba link I sent earlier, http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=178228&amp;highlight=
you will see what a type 4 washer looks like......  It has a 021 105 235 part number. Unlike the steel type 1
washer,  111 105 235A.
