Volks:

Since it's Friday, and since, as some of you know, because of my
dissertation I'm knee deep in the list archives as well as data from the
online survey that I put up (HUGE thanks to those who participated, it's
very important and groundbreaking data), I started wondering what happened
to the voices that were a large part of the list when I was active in it, in
the late '90s.  
Whatever happened to:

Charlie Ford
Bob Hoover
Sean Bartnik...and others?

I know Ken Hooper is still involved in a way, and Ted Finesman (my savior!)
as well.  I wonder how many people still post who remember my desperate
pleas for help as I was fixing the late lamented Gumby the Wonderbus?

Probably the basis for another study; but since it's Friday, the basis of
idle speculation.

Probably six or eight weeks until it's &quot;Dr. Henry&quot; to you, mister.
