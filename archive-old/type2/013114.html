hello,

The mechanism that holds the door open has a little
spring in it. I found this out when I removed my
sliding door to replace the rusted bottom. This spring
probably has poped out. I know mine did and I found it
across the shop! It resembles the spring in a close
pin but is smaller and has more winds.(sorry that was
the first thing I could think of. It is also possible
that the latch arm is bent or broken. I don't know if
that helps any or not. You will need to take the cover
that goes over the sliding door chanel under the back
window to really see what you are doing. 

As far as the roller goes, there are three metal
rollers on the sliding door, one on top, two on
bottom. The one on the top just slides off a peg. That
is probably the one that came off. I have never had
one come off when the door was on the vehicle though.
Make sure that you grease the inside of the rooler
before you put it back on.

Good Luck.

lock, the one
