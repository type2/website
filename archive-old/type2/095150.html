Subject: 71 Steering Box Adjustment

Yes I know I'm not supposed to mess with this (at least that was the =
concensus in the archives), but as it is the steering is sometimes ok =
and sometimes hits a tight spot where the wheel is very hard to turn =
(the center point, I'm assuming).  So I need to adjust it or I'll die.  =
The Bently book says to use a special microtorque measurement device or =
to have someone who knows how its supposed to feel adjust the peg to the =
proper torque/pressure.  Lacking both what should I do? Can someone =
describe &quot;how its supposed to feel?&quot;
