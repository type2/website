Subject: Boys by The Bridge 7 Pics

Looking to fill a calendar of Busses and Boys of Havasu 2003 and am looking
for a few more pictures of the boys of the Havasu Polar Bear Club. Kind of
funny how little the suits were before the water and how they fit fine
after......is that shrinkage or expansion?     If you have any pictures from
the Thong event at Havasu could you send them to me!   Also any other unusual
Havasu campout pictures would be appreciated to.
Thanks
Rob
