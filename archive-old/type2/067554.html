Subject: Trip Report (not too long)

Volks,

Today's my first day back after 2 weeks leave.

My CVs threatened to upset my trip plans but that problem was eventually 
resolved (see earlier post).

My wonderful, patient SO and I went from Orange, NSW, Australia to The 
Entrance, NSW (actually Bateau Bay, near The Entrance). We used a family 
holiday cottage as our base and did day trips around the area and to 
Sydney. It's the first time we've holidayed there without the kids since 
our honeymoon (25 years ago last month). 

Highlight of the holiday was a one day mystery flight with Ansett 
Airways. We ended up in Hobart, Tasmania. Hired a car and drove down to 
Port Arthur, an old convict settlement. Bit spooky driving down (a maniac 
shot 35 people therre last April) but it was OK and very interesting 
when we got there.  Had a great day but it took us a couple of days to  
recover from the 17 hour day (not really, but it was a good excuse to do 
even less on our holiday). 

The bus travelled about 900 miles over 1 1/2 weeks and averaged 23mpg 
(Imp), or 19.2mpg (US). That's a 1776 with twin Kadron's. 

The Bean Machine (my new name for the bus - it's a long story) ran really 
well. It's great to run up the hills on the Newcastle Freeway on either 
side of the Hawkesbury River at 55mph in top. (You non Aussies will have 
to check an atlas).

When I got home I felt that the engine was a bit sluggish. I checked and 
it needs a very slight adjustment to the points and timing, which I will  
do next weekend.

Other highlight of the holiday was purchasing another '72 bus for $A600. 
It has a non working engine but it's a 'deluxe' model with rubber bits on 
the bumpers and the polished metal trim on the rounded bit below the 
windows. Generally it's in better condition inside and out than the Bean 
Machine. 

I paid $A175 to have it picked up from a place near Gosford, NSW and 
delivered next morning to my front gate in Orange. A distance of over 250 
miles. Man that was lucky, and cheap. It would have cost me over $A100 to go 
and get it and trailer it home.

I'm going to get the engine working and swap the 1776, and the reco'd 
gearbox, and my new CV'd drive shafts, out of the Bean Machine into the 
Green Bean Machine (this is getting silly), put the 1600, etc back in the 
Bean Machine and try and sell it. Maybe I'll get my cousin to buy it back 
from me for what I paid him. Ha!

Joel, please update the stats.

By the way, when you people buy extra VWs, do other people ask you &quot;Why?&quot;
