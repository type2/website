I'll second that.  I've blown 2 tires over a 5km stretch in the middle 
of the desert
and it's no fun to be stuck without a spare, waiting for someone nice 
enough to
stop by and give you a lift to the nearest town.  Luckily, I had two, 
but the next 300 km
were a bit stressful.

Yes, Bus Drivers, there are still a lot of places out there without cell 
phone coverage,
and I hesitate to say that it'll be a lot harder to find a spare tire 
for your bus in the
middle of nowhere than in the comfort of your own home.  Not to mention 
anything of
what kind of premium you'll pay for that tire...

Mind you, 2 spares is probably a pretty good practice for long X-C 
journeys even
if you're not venturing out on gravel roads.
