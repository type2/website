&gt; Hello out there,
&gt; 
&gt; We're the people driving from Toronto to Mexico next year. We'll be
&gt; leaving
&gt; July 2nd. My concern is the intense heat experienced in the southern
&gt; states
&gt; during that time of year, especially Texas- 100 degrees+ during the day.
&gt; We
&gt; have a '76 Bus with no air conditioner and we will be traveling with two
&gt; children,
&gt; one 9 years old the other 1 year.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm wondering if anybody knows of a makeshift a.c. or an alternative
&gt; a.c.
&gt; or a cheap a.c.!

People have been travelling thoughout the southwest and Mexico for
centuries without A/C.  VWs were made specifically without air
conditioning and therefore are excellent vehicles for this trip.  &quot;modern&quot;
vehicles are designed with A/C required to keep normal temps in their
poorly-vented passenger compartments.  Buses have lots of vents to keep
the air flowing!

For the kids, a couple of spray bottles and a cooler full of beverages
will make all the difference.  Keep everyone well hydrated.  Tint on the
windows and a roof rack with a shade (sheet of 1/4 plywood) will also keep
temps down.  

Get in the habit of starting the day's travels early and take it easy in
the midday sun.  The habit of the &quot;siesta&quot; was born of necessity, not
sloth!

don't try to put too much driving into one day.  I've spent a lot of time
in Sonora, Mexico, and have watched many folks blasting through in their
quest to get to Mazatlan in a 1-week vacation.  four days later they are
back, looking frazzled, but with that Mazatlan T-shirt!  I think that I
had more fun staying put and enjoying the local flavor.

&quot;Wherever you go, There you are!&quot;
