Subject: poor delila

hey all. i'm hoping someone can give me a hand with a little problem.  my 70 
bus-delila seems to be having emotional troubles.  she's got a new starter 
and battery, but she still is quite lazy with the cranking.  what could 
cause this?  is it just a bad connection somewhere?  or is it a bigger 
problem?  i've got two weeks to get her running so i can move (ick).  i'd 
really appreciate anyone's recommendations.  TIA.
