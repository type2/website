Subject: fuel sender access hole cutting dimensions

 
How is that for a concise subject line? Ooops.

Are there any pointers on the net for finding the correct
location to cut an access hatch to reach the fuel sender
from the top?
 
I have a 77.  I've checked the archives for info and mostly
came up with a debate about whether or not to cut. I read what
I could, decided to cut a hatch, and am wondering where it should
go.
 
If someone could lend some direction as to the operation, that
would be splendid.

thanks all
matt
