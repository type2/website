From: &quot;Chris Mills&quot; &lt;scm9985_at_tntech_dot_edu&gt;
&gt; I saw an RV running down I-40 in middle Tn one day dragging a Westy for a
support vehicle. Was far from being able to see the hitch.

I'll stop by some of the local RV places here and see if I can learn
something about it.  Though with the Masters Tournament coming up at the
Augusta National, I'll probably put it off until traffic up that way thins
out after the &quot;foreigners&quot; go home.

Oh joy, and this year we get to dodge protesters.  Let's see, we have those
protesting the men-only policy of a private club for, you guessed it, men
(sort of like getting sued because you won't let someone with a Humvee join
a VW Bus-only club)...

[deleted non-VW and extremely controversial comments related to protesting.
