Subject: Brake booster trouble

I think I read this before,, But I can't find the answer in the archives or the
library, 

What makes the brake pedal pull it self to the floor,, or,, is it holding itself
down after the brake application

I have a 74 Vw with vac assist brakes, the pedal stays on the floor and the
brakes are applied ,,

I don't think it is all four flex lines screwing up, could it be the vac assist?

Thanks
Jamie Rivers
