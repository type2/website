Subject: Need two little items

Can anyone tell me where I might be able to get the items listed below? They 
are for my '75 Deluxe.

1.   Owners manual

2.  VW symbol that goes on the front

Also would like info. regarding carpet kit. The carpet in my '75 is on top 
of the original rubber mats, but is kind of ratty. I would like to replace 
it but don't know if I should take the time to cut my own, or if there are 
kits available. Any suggestions?
