Subject: Rocker Arm Shims  ?

This is the second time in two years I have had to have a head rebuilt
because the  valve stems are damage because they are not spinning.

When I rebuilt the engine last time I tried to assemble the rocker arms so
they are off center on the valve stems.  The sides of the rockers seem to
have worn such that this adjustment is not possible.  Are there shims
available to bring these rockers back in place?

I always replace the valve screws but need a way to adjust the offcenter so
they will spin the valves correctly.  Any one know a source for such shims?


Thanks
