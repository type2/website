Subject: RE: [T2] FRIDAY - Water Injection System

Rick,

Uhh, brain fart mode off(I hope&lt;grin&gt;).

Being physics challenged yesterday, my point was that air with a lot
of water mixed in with it appears to be able to absorb heat better.

On thinking about it some more after I sent it, I wondered if it was 
correct....for example....

If you could instantly transport a acvw engine from the desert(0% 
humidity) to someplace like houston(100% humidity) with the air temps 
exactly the same, would it run cooler in Houston?

I suspect the answer is a resounding *no*.

What we had here was more than likely a lot of cooler water splashing up 
on the bottom of the engine and pulling more heat out that way.

What I didn't see anyone mention was the fact that a vw engine with a 
spray injector on the outside shooting into the fan would no longer be
just an air cooled engine&lt;grin&gt;, but a water cooled engine.

Nice Friday mental exercise though!

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Sorry Dave, I gotta disagree on this one too.  Humid air is actually less
&gt; dense than dry air.  Water vapor behaves mostly like any other gas.  Dry air
&gt; is a mixture of mostly N2 and O2.  Humid air has N2 and O2 and H20
&gt; molecules.  H20 is about half the weight of N2 or O2.  A given volume of air
&gt; has room for only a certain number of molecules.  If some of the N2 and O2
&gt; are displaced by lighter H2O, then the resulting mixture is less dense.  I'm
&gt; not sure whether dry or humid air has more capacity to absorb heat.  A
&gt; disclaimer here:  LIQUID water will absorb lots of heat before turning into
&gt; water vapor, so a mixture of humid air and water droplets would be a pretty
&gt; good coolant.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll try to restrain my compulsive teaching tendencies for the rest of the
&gt; night :)

&gt; Jason,
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm....I must have been asleep for about 10 years or something...
&gt; 
&gt; What? notoriously *hot* t4 engine are we discussing here??????
&gt; 
&gt; Moisture laden air is able to absorb more heat or cool cause it is
&gt; &quot;thicker&quot;....or as the physicists among us will call heat absorbtion
&gt; factor.  More molecules of water in the air means it is denser and can do
&gt; more &quot;work&quot; to heat or cool.
&gt; 
&gt; Splashing a lot of water on the bottom of the case always helps too!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was thinking again (always dangerous) about helping the aircooled engine
&gt; &gt; run cooler and came up with an idea that I wanted to bounce off of The
&gt; List.
&gt; &gt;   In lieu of spending up to $250 for an external oil cooler and dealing
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; the mounting and thermostat issues, I was thinking about alternatives that
&gt; &gt; help keep the notoriously-hot T4 engine cooler.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was driving in the rain yesterday, and noticed that my engine temps were
&gt; &gt; much lower than they usually are on this same route.  I got to thinking
&gt; (see
&gt; &gt; first sentence) about the cooling and evaporative effects that water has
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; the aircooled engine, and wondered if the &quot;rainy day&quot; condition could be
&gt; &gt; replicated on dry days.  I live at 8,000 feet elevation, and the air up
&gt; here
&gt; &gt; is very dry and pretty thin, so its cooling effectiveness is not as great
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; it is in thick, humid air environs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My &quot;rainy day&quot; theory is that road spray on the bottom of the oil sump
&gt; adds
&gt; &gt; more cooling, which makes the oil cooler.  Also, the increased humidity
&gt; &gt; (both from rain and road spray) gets pulled into the fan where its
&gt; &gt; evaporative effects add more cooling to the cylinders and oil cooler.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I came up with the idea of a &quot;water injection system&quot; which goes something
&gt; &gt; like this:  A windshield washer reservoir on the left-side battery tray
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; a low-pressure pump that could be actuated by a momentary switch on the
&gt; &gt; dash.  A hose runs from the reservoir to the tin in front (RIF) of the
&gt; fan,
&gt; &gt; where water would drip onto the tin and get sucked into the fan.  Water
&gt; &gt; droplets would either flash into steam or get atomized by the fan, get
&gt; blown
&gt; &gt; over the cylinders, and add humidity and density to the cooling air.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It all seems to work (in theory), but I'm sure there are problems with
&gt; &gt; localized cooling and different rates of metal expansion and contraction.
&gt; &gt; Anybody care to jump in on this one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening,
