Ken listed ten good ones, but there is an eleventh:

(11) Wire. I carry a roll of stainless wire, about .032&quot;, if
I recall correctly. You can use it to (a) make a hose clamp,
(b) keep that errant part from falling off the vehicle,
(c) serve as a locknut, (d) secure the door with the broken
latch, etc. and (e) serve as a second set of hands to hold things in
place while you assemble them properly (with duct tape, no doubt).

Bailing wire rusts, and so if done in stainless, your &quot;temporary&quot;
repair will last much longer!


(12) Now that I think about it, there is also a neat tool used with this
stuff that takes both ends of a strand and twists them together
perfectly, tightening as it goes. Perfect for clamps. $20.00 from Harbor
Freight.
