I have an interesting story of my own along these lines.  A few months ago I was replacing the rear shocks in my 71 bus, and noticed a few spider webs running from underneath the rear bumper area to the ground.  I wiped them away with my hand and took a cursory look underneath my bumper, and when I saw no spiders, I proceeded to remove my rear wheels and do my work.  I reached a point when I wanted to rest, and as I was laying on my back on my driveway, looking up at the underside of my bus, I saw the biggest Black Widow I've ever seen, staring at me from a cranny in the chassis, about a foot from my face.  Needless to say, I got out of there very quickly, and gassed her with bug spray.  Actually, I gassed the whole underside of the rear end of my bus.  I feel lucky not to have been bitten, since my arms, hands, head, etc  probably came within biting distance many times while working under the fender.
