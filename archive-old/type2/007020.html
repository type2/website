Hi Volks,

the how-to for the conversion to inline-4 watercooled VW engines of 
Bay transporters is going to be translated to English.  I'll notify 
the List when it is done and available.  Thanks to everyone who 
voiced interest!  This may take a while though - everyone's busy, 
just as always...

Yours,
    Erik.
