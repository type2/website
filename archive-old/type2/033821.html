Subject: Fire warning!

Here is a warning for all those with worn oily foam engine compartment
seals.Mine was pretty well non existent, but on a short trip last two weeks
ago I had a fellow pull-up behind me to let me know I had flames coming from
the back of my bus. I had just installed my gas heat so i feared the worst.
After I *&amp;(% my pant I open up the engine compartment to find that it was
the seal burning up. I guess a piece had fallen down onto either the heater
box or the muffler and the oily foam had caught fire.. No damage to anything
else but could have been worse.
So....If yours is getting kinda shbby looking REPLACE it.
