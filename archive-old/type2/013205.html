The folks at Discount Tire were reasonable in replacement of the sub
standard tires on my 83 AirCooled Westfalia.
they offered and I accepted.
100% Refund on the tires I purchased.
100% Refund on the following items, sales tax, disposal fee, lifetime
balance, road hazard warranty, mounting and valve stems.
That gets me into a new set of five Michlein (newest tire) reccomended by
Michlein USA for this application for about $12.00 per tire turnkey with
road hazard, lifetime balance, valve stems, but I pay the sales tax on
the $12.00 per tire. There is not a disposal fee on warranty tires.
The arbitrator for Discount Tire did not specify a name for the tire (new
tire in Michlein line, there are none in the US at this time) but said it
was the right diameter and in every way was an 60,000 mile warranty tire
for the Westfalia.
The tires are in Europe and it will take about two weeks before they are
warehoused and distributed in the US to dealers.
Since to date there exist &quot;No Harm No Foul&quot; with no accidents, injuries
or supplimental maintenance I feel that they have been fair and equitable
in their offer.
