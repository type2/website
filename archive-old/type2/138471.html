Subject: Re: [T2] Cylinder Head Paint -redux

Man, I misspoke:  I did not MEAN cylinder HEADS; I meant the 'jugs'  Mea 
culpa

Anodizing = To coat (a metallic surface) electrolytically with a protective 
or decorative oxide

Man, if you have a rich pitina of rust on the cylinder heads  &lt;&lt; bad  , all 
you have to so is spray the cylinder heads &lt;&lt; more bad

phosphoric acid + aluminum =  pita pet !!!!
