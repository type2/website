Subject: Re: [T2] Caharging problems

i dont have enough experience mechanically to give advice...but will give you a shot on troubleshooting.
check to see that the battery cables are good and tight?
what about a regulator&gt;?
when you take the cable off the battery and stick it back to it without the key in it does it give a spark at connect? if so that might mean that something isnt cutting off and is draining you down ...?((((((((((((( dont take cable off battery while running,,,,,))))))))
if no spark then????????
good luck roberto... you can also get advance or auto zone to check to see if everything is charging right?
peace

charging power since after a few driving days the battery is gone
I will apreciate any input on the subject.
Thanks in advance
