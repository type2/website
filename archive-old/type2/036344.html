Subject: WebPage put together...

hi all,

i'd been threatening to put some pictures of my 61 bus rescue on the web
for a while.

anyone curious can point their browser at:

http://webusers.anet-stl_dot_com/~spw/photo.htm

its pretty bare bones, but i plan to fix it up snazzy in the future.


take care,

Steve

p.s. i tried to pare down the photo size to an acceptable level, let me
know if they are too big and i'll thumbnail it.
