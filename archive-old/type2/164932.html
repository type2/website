&gt; Scott , Has your customer found an engine yet?

&gt; I was wondering , I may have one here..  how do you ship an  
&gt; engine .. better
&gt; said,, who do you call to ship and engine from Ontario to ? Alberta?
&gt;

they are still looking. they have one of the heads off and the piston  
had a catastrophic event...this all started when they found the  
engine wouldn't start, then noticed it would not turn over by hand,  
then taking apart they found out the piston hit the valve. there are  
some cracks in their case also, unrelated damage from an earlier  
catastrophic event when it looks like the flex plate came adrift of  
the torque converter while driving.

so rather than repair their engine, it may be better to find a used  
one. they are beating the bushes in banff but not having a lot of  
luck yet with anything complete.

as for freight on an engine, i don't think it would be difficult,  
just load it on a skid and either drive it to a truck freight company  
or have it picked up. 3-400.00 should get it there, maybe a bit less  
with luck, but not a whole lot less.
