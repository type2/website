&gt;       OK, I know there are a few of you bus people out there in the
&gt; Raleigh area, cause I have sorta, briefly, indirectly met you, but I am
&gt; just wondering if there are any official bus/vw clubs or anything in NC

We, the proudly unorganized members of the Triangle Area Busses have
meetings/get-togethers/camp-outs every couple months or so, as well as joint
bus-work sessions. Just keep an eye out, as they usually get posted a couple
weeks in advance. (Speaking of which, anyone up for something? It's about
time... hint hint)
  Other than that, you can always join LiMBO, which is a national organization,
and the sister club of NEATO, which is definately a wonderful organization.
  Unfortunately, some of us bussers are not the most motivated in terms of
organizing anything official...
:)
However, feel free to e-mail me if you have any ideas or want to try to set
something up. Most of us are always up for a bus adventure, but just don't want
to do all the motivating.
