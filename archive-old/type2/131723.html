Subject: RE: [T2] 1700 upgrade to 2000, difficulties

&gt;&gt;Cam and lifters are they different as well?



&gt;From: &quot;Mike's Bus&quot; If these are hydraulic then yes...... 1700 were &quot;solid&quot; 
&gt;lifters and cam some
&gt;2.0L had hydraulic lifters and cam

Okay so the solid lifters and cam from a 2.0L are the same as a 1.7L. Any 
reason why the Hydraulic Cam and Lifters would not work? I ask because the 
Hydraulic Cam and Lifters are interchangable with the Solid Cam and Lifters 
in the 2.0L.


Thanks,

Michael Knight
