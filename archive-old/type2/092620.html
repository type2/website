Remove the rubber floor mat completely. Pull up the boot. Vacuum the junk=20

Remove the cross bolt and bushings from the shift link at the rear. Push=20
the rear shift rod back into the trans. Now you can move the front, long=20
shift rod back and have just enough room to install the front bushing.=20
Note: there are two types of front bushings, an early type and later type.=

I think the split was 74. Bentley only shows the earlier version. Don't let=

Clean and grease and reinstall the shifter. A bit of care is needed to get=

the pin with it's small spring seated within the ball and socket. Pushing=20
down against the big plate spring, reinstall the bolts and adjust the plate=
