Hi Everybody,
   I'd like to flush out the fuel tank of my 71 westy while it is in place.  
I ordered a new screen, seal, and fuel line hose from one of the usual 
vendors, but the seal is back ordered.
   Can anyone tell me what kind of seal is used in that fuel tank outlet.  
I'm hoping it is something like a soft metal ring, or crush gasket, that can 
be reused if necessary.  If it's some other material, like rubber, cork, or 
gasket material I'll have to wait.
   I need to get this done now, as the wife and I want to use the bus for a 
trip from Long Island, New York to Flint,Michigan and back in about a week 
and a half.  In fact if any of you have an extra of the seal I need, how 
bout selling it to me?
