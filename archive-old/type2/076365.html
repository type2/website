Subject: Re: [T2] Steering column

fatmac99_at_mindspring_dot_com sends:

&gt; Has anyone ever tried installing a non-VW steering column in their bus?  The
&gt; column in my 76 has a host of problems, some inflicted by me, others just
&gt; there.  I thought it would be nice to put in something different, tilt wheel
&gt; maybe!  Several reasons to do this.  I don't like where the key is.  My hand
&gt; is too fat to turn the key comfortably(I know, waaa).  I don't like the
&gt; placement of the wipers.  I need a new surround as I tore the other one off
&gt; not knowing how to get it off when I replaced the ignition switch.  And I
&gt; wasn't kidding about tilt wheel.  I saw it in a Corvair Greenbrier once, it
&gt; was a great idea.  So, any ideas?

I don't know how to do the tilt wheel...but!

Old cars had the ignition switch in the dashboard. Saab 900s have the
keyswitch next to the shifter. Nothing says you have to leave the keyswitch
in the steering column--your state law might have something to say about it,
but the bus is a 76; just tell the guy at the inspection station your old
ignition switch broke and you couldn't find the proper replacement, so you
just bought one of the Help! ones from the FLAPS.

As for the wiper switch, just go to the FLAPS, buy a two-position windshield
wiper dash-mount switch (I've seen 'em in the Help! display of carded &quot;patch
your car together&quot; stuff) and wire it up.
