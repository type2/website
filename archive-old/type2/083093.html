&gt; &gt;Greetings,
&gt; &gt;I want to buy some jack and stands for my bus.  I currently own no jacks or
&gt; &gt;stands.
&gt; ========================&gt;
&gt; I wanted to reply to this in open forum because I feel strongly on the issue.
&gt;
&gt; Jack
&gt; for changing tires, general maintenance, etc................
&gt; Get the really nice scissors jack sold by Bus Depot.
&gt; Just get it !!!
&gt; It works awesome and is a safe way to lift your bus !!
&gt; The original issue is a Maypole of insecurity.

Hmmm, are you referring to the stock screw jack that plugs into the jack
points?  I always thought of this one as being quite secure compared to
the standard issue Bug jack which really could slip.  In fact, I picked
up a second bus screw jack to go in our bug!

The only caution I would have with the bus screw jack is to block the
wheels really well, as it cannot oppose any side loads.  No other jack
that fits under the passenger seat will be able to oppose side loads
either
