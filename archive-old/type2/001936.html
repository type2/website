&lt;I called them the other day and was told that I might see my stuff by the
end of next week&gt;

I did say it, except I referred to customer service as &quot;them&quot;. I dialed
their toll-free number, and then had to call back on their customer service
# on my dime. If I get my stuff by the end of next week, it will almost be
three weeks since I placed my order. It's obviously not just me that's
affected. I have received several private emails from enthusiasts with
similar issues.

&gt; ...I didn't notice anything in your post about trying to contact their
customer service department to air your grievance.  If you haven't done
that, maybe it would have been appropriate prior to bringing it to the list.
&gt; Just a thought.....

&gt; &gt;I am very displeased with the Bus Depot's slow service. On the
&gt; &gt;recommendation of several VW enthusiasts, I placed an order over a week
and
&gt; &gt;a half ago for a bunch of parts (mostly sheet metal) for my '73 Westy.
After
&gt; &gt;not hearing anything for about a week, I called them the other day and
was
&gt; &gt;told that I might see my stuff by the end of next week. When I placed my
&gt; &gt;order at their counter, I was originally told that my parts would be drop
&gt; &gt;shipped in about three business days. I told them that I really needed my
&gt; &gt;sheet metal parts ASAP so my welder could get started and not screw up
his
&gt; &gt;work schedule this month.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Assuming my parts do show up next week, it will have taken over 2 1/2
weeks
&gt; &gt;for receipt. I was really hoping to have at least my sheet metal work
done
&gt; &gt;by the time of &quot;Westies in the Woods&quot; on the 25th. Looks like that is not
&gt; &gt;going to happen now. Nether my &quot;73 Westy or I am a happy &quot;camper&quot; right
now.
