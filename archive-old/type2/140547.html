Subject: Re: [T2] heater aux blower fan

From dan radom:

A couple of days ago when it was cold as hell here my aux heater blower  fan decided to stop blowing.  On
closer inspection the 16a fuse in the engine compartment had melted a little bit on one end.  The fuse didn't
pop, but it certainly melted enough to make it not work.  I replaced the fuse and made it through the really
cold spell (one more day / one more melted fuse).  I've checked the connection under the dash, and  everything
is making contact and looks as I think it should.  Does this  sound like a wiring problem or is the fan dead
or dying?  I bought this
 fan used (it was expensive!) around three months ago, but I've only used
 it a small handful of times.  I've heard rumors that these have been
 replaced with a similar squirrel cage fan used in bilge pumps in boats.
 Does anyone know if that is a drop in replacement, or does the plastic
 blower unit that the fan attaches to need to be modified or replaced?
 Any ideas on cost of these bilge motor fan things?  I don't need much,
 but I do need some forced air at idle.

The switch up front is the ground circuit for the relay. No power there.

If the fuse is melting, then the blower motor is drawing too many amps.
You could put an ammeter in instead of the fuse to check the draw. But that would be a waste of time. You need
another blower fan.

Can't tell you much about the bilge fans. The stock system works fine for me.

There are 2 versions of the heater fan, early and late. Early early ones are metal housings. Early ones have
the fan wires coming out as a harness on the side. Late ones, the 2 wire harness plugs into the end of the
motor.

I have a few good fans here. Do you need early or late?
