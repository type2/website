Subject: Re: [T2] Window removal...

I find all the windows are easy to remove except the windshield... i cracked mine trying to replace it and gave in and called the pros. it even took a professional an hour and a half to do it, he said it was the
most difficult window he'd ever replaced. If you are getting new then you can cut the inside lip of the seal off and the windows will just come right out with someone on the outside to make sure you don't just
push them out onto the pavement.  I find the rear door glass to be very easy to do, I've done it on 2 buses and both times it took less than half an hour.  Let the new rubber warm in the sun though to make it
more elastic. Also use a sealant. the guy who replaced my windshield told me that he always sees people not using glass sealant between the seals and the body and this leads to rust. He also said it is unsafe as
without the sealant the windows can easily pop out in an accident.  I got a demonstration on my bus.  I don't know where the sealant can be purchased though.
good luck
James


&gt; How hard is it to remove ALL the windows on a 1973 bus?? I want to replace it all window seals with new rubber, and new chrome. Is the hardest of all to remove the windshield?? How about the rear door glass?
&gt; How good is the reproduction rubber they sell _at_ the Bus Boys or any other source??
&gt; Do I just push from the inside out?? Any &quot;secret&quot; techniques??
