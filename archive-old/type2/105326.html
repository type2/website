Subject: Re: [T2] heater boxes

I installed 72-74 style heater boxes on my 78 bus last April. I had to 
take and drill out the holes on the heater boxes a little bit bigger. I 
also ground down the rounded part on each tip of he mounting flange that 
goes onto the head. You also want to take a straight edge to the top of 
the flange to make sure they are perfectly flat. If not use a file and 
correct it.The time spent on opening up the holes on the flange and 
making sure its flat is time well spent. You don't want to put anyside 
stress on the exhaust studs in the head. You also want the flange to fit 
perfect against the head..  Then fit the boxes with new copper gaskets. 
Don't crank them down yet. Now install the muffler to the boxes also 
just snug. Now that everything is on use a torque wrench and tighten 
everything to spec.  Any more questions ?
