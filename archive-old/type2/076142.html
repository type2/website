Subject: Re: [T2] The journey of moisture and a change of heart about undercoating.

I don't doubt that rolling out of the factory the
undercoating on VW's were fine &amp; worked
effectively,but I regularly hear complaints about the
difficulty in repairing the metal underneath that
rusts. 
Sure,the undercoating worked,but for how long?
Nothing short of a chemical stripper or a sandblaster
gets the damn stuff off &amp; it's a liability in a big
way.
As for factory paint being  the best stuff for it,well
I can tell you I had my laugh for the day.
Read an article on a vintage beetle or bus sometime &amp;
it always reads that the spray painter gave the bus
very feww coats to retain the factory feel &amp; look.
That's right,they didn't waste any extra paint on your
bus the day before it came out of the factory.
So lets be reasonable &amp; admit that both factory
undercoat &amp; paintjobs have their weaknesses.
I guess we're all whining abouu the same thing in the
end....RUST!!
:-)
Cheers

&gt; One more thought on this undercoating failure sit-
&gt; com.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason the stuff failed, is because the owner's
&gt; of the vehicle's
&gt; didn't inspect, and maintain the undercoating, that
&gt; is prone to rock and
&gt; other damage, in it's journey though its life span.
&gt; 
&gt; Get a rock mark or chip in it, it will collect
&gt; moisture, and sure it's
&gt; going to rust.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't blame the substance that was applied---blame
&gt; the procrastinating
&gt; owner for not staying on top ( or bottom in this
&gt; case ) of the
&gt; situation.
&gt; 
&gt; If you didn't ever wash or wax the upper body--ever
&gt; on your vehicle, how
&gt; long do you think it would last?
&gt; 
&gt; This subject relates to anything else----no
&gt; maintenance---no longevity.
