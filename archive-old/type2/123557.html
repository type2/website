Subject: slider lock swap

the only thing i miss about my 72 was the way the slider closed and locked
in a two-step motion.  does anyone know whether 73 and earlier lock systems
can replace those 74 and up? would it be more than just the lock? has
anyone considered or tried this with success.  - steve
