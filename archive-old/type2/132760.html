Subject: Oil Pressure Light on- advice needed 

Couple days ago I put on a new starter - went for a short drive maybe two

blocks- the oil indicator light starts to glow - gets brighter and brighter

until I turn around and get home

I find that I have oil flying around in the fan housing - not dripping under

the bottom but getting into the fan and being flung around- dripping out of
the fan seem

I figure I have a nasty oil leak causing a pressure drop ? My oil level was

still good - in between the two dip marks

After I get the fan housing off I find the housing full off oil and a fair

build up around the pump

Can anybody give me a good idea of where to look - not sure what the next

step should be

I have had no trouble with my bus at all recently - in fact I thought I was

making some head way - any help on how to proceed will be appreciated

I found a couple tears in the dipstick boot - I figure this may be my leak -
could a leak there cause a pressure drop ? Light comes on at start then goes
out - slowly starts to glow until on completely - revving doesn't turn it
out -
any ideas ?

Thanks

Eric
