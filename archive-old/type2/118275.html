Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure light remains on

I checked the resistance across the oil pressure sensor with the
engine running. It was 2KOhms. Probably not enough in itself to turn
off the LED (14V/2KO ~= 7milliamps).

I took out the sensor this morning and smeared a thin layer of ultra
blue on the threads and reinstalled it.

This seemed to do the trick : with the gasket sealant, the resistance
is probably high enough to turn off the LED....

When I brought the Vanagon to Bugformance, they probably took out the
sensor to check the oil pressure but had omitted to &quot;reseal&quot; the
threads.

Thanks you all for the responses.
