 I am a mechanical idiot, I think the book was written for me....anyway have
 a '73 that I successfully removed the old, rusty extractor type
 exhaust....but my nice new stainless steel stock type muffler doesn't want
 to co-operate....if I try to go straight on, it hangs up on the studs, if I
 put one side on fully, the other side is about an inch or so too low...I
 don't want to try to persuade it and break somthing...stupid questions, but
 any help is appreciated as I need the bus soon for the big move to our own
 house.

I didn't see anyone reply to this, so I'll make a suggestion. I assume you 
are trying to bolt the exhaust to your heater boxes.  You will need to loosen 
up the heater box studs on the heads, install the exhaust and slowly tighten 
everything up.  Don't force anything here, take your time and if it won't 
tighten up, then its possible that your exhaust has a flaw.  You may need to 
drill your flange holes out a little larger.

You can also run into problems trying to loosen the exhaust studs.  They 
often break off and your simple exhaust replacement may turn into a nightmare.

Good luck.
