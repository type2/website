Subject: HELP! Pilot bearing gone

I received what I think is a new pilot bearing w/ my new Luk clutch kit. I
didn't know what it was , so I figured I didn't need it. In an effort to try
to locate it on my engine,
I think I found what used to be a pilot bearing. This bearing goes in the
clutch end of the crank before the flywheel? And allows the main tranny
shaft to slide over? If so my old one was fried and its outer remains seem
welded to the sides. Is it supposed to just slide out? I'd like to get the
what's left of the old one out, and put the new one in. Any advice on
getting it out. I'm afraid to pound at it w/ a chissle. I was just about to
put the engine back in and drive away!
Please Advise.
