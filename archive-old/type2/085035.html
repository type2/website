Subject: Westfakia values?

Here is an odd question that I have not found a good answer to.

What is a good value for a nice Westfakia?  And is there a way to take a
regular transporter and cut the hole properly in the top for a pop top?

Here is the situation:  Parts '73 Westi with perfect interior, more rust on
the bottom that you can possible imagine.  '71 Transporter, busted engine
but good body.  Total outlay for both about $1000.

Figure in parts for restoration to be about $500.  My time is essentially
free.

If I can get a hole in the roof it would be really nice and a darn nice
camper that really you could not tell the difference...  Not that I would
defraud a buyer like that, but at the same time it does not scream Fakia!
Fakia! :)
   
Anyway lets say the hole in the roof is impossible, what would a perfect
condition westi interior in a good body go for?  I like to put them back on
the road but need some beer money at the same time!  I figure if it is worth
a solid 2000-2500 it would be worth the effort involved.

Thanks and any insights are greatly appreciated.
