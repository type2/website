Subject: Stuck valve on a '71?

My 1971 VW Bus with a stock 1600 DP is telling me that the #3 cylinder is
having a bad hair day.  Compression (post valve adjustment) in #3 tested
yesterday at 85# while everyone else was at #120 to #135.  I'm wondering if
(A) a replacement set of heads is the only option I have at this point and (B)
what might have caused a valve failure at just 35,000 miles?

In early 2000, the previous owner had a rebuild done at 217,000 miles with all
the usual things accomplished or replaced.  The receipt said &quot;new&quot; heads but I
suspect that they were rebuilt or reconditioned just like you'd expect.

I bought the Bus early last year at 240,000 miles. Compression soon after I
got it was 135, 135, 135, 145.  At 244,000 I checked the compression and they
were running about 120, 120, 120, 135 but the variance is probably due to
issues with the gauge and a lot of other things.  The important piece of info
is that all four cylinders were relatively close to one another.  My valve
adjustments during the initial period were usually pretty normal (one or two
too tight, one or two too loose).

At 246,000, I checked the valves again to find the 1, 2, &amp; 4 exhausts tight.
Worried about this, especially given the fact that these were exhaust valves
and that the clearances were negligible, I did another check at 247,000 and
again found the 1, 2, &amp; 4 exhausts tight.

Ever since I bought the Bus I had been uncomfortable about the performance.  I
suspected erratic timing issues and after about 7,000 miles of messing around
with the P.O.'s dual vacc dizzy with a Pertronix ignition, I finally swapped
in my old .009 and every thing was hunky-dory.

At 249,500, I checked the valves again to find that all four exhausts were
tight.  At 250,200 I checked and now 1E, 2E, and 4E were too tight.  This
wasn't good at all...  #3E was, surprisingly, fairly loose.

At 251,000 I began to hear a subtle noise from the exhaust when accelerating
that sounded just like as if a exhaust gasket had gone out between the head
and the heater box or the muffler.  But closer inspection revealed that the
sound was coming out of the tailpipe and not a gasket connection.  The next
day I checked and again 1E, 2E, and 4E were too tight and 3E was too loose.
Yesterday near 252,000, I checked the valves to find the same pattern (1E, 2E,
and 4E were too tight, 3E was too loose) and the compression to find #3
woefully under the average.

I can't really say the Bus ever ran obviously hot during this period.  It has
a oil sump temp gauge which usually stayed around normal operating temps (I
define &quot;normal operating temps&quot; as the average figure showing during early
morning runs on the flat roads along the California coastline in cool weather)
in 90% of my driving experience.  The engine never had that hot smell to it or
ticked away madly when stopped, all the usual signs of a problem (I've been
driving 1600 Busses since 1977 or so).  I suppose there could have been
instances where a drive up a hill or heavy L.A. traffic in hot weather could
have sent things up but these would have been brief experiences at best.  The
oil pressure gauge also stayed about where it should.  I've checked the
vacc\manifold system, replacing the manifold boots and gaskets, checking for
losses to the brake booster, etc., etc.  As far as I could tell, things are OK
in that area.  Timing was an issue with the dual vacc dizzy (I think the
retard system had issues) but for the last 5,000 miles on the .009 it's been
set at 29 degrees total advance, the same figure I've used for years.

In writing all of this up I can see that my compression loss was easily
predictable but like all VW owners, I'm an optimist and assumed that the valve
issues were transitory.  I should have checked the compression just as often
as I adjusted the valves given that there were obvious warning signs but I'm
human and therefore lazy.

So what's the deal?  Is it my #3 exhaust valve that isn't seating correctly?
Would that explain why it was the only exhaust valve that didn't get tighter
and tighter?  Is there any way I can mechanically loosen the sucker without
dropping the engine?  I don't have any problem with pulling the motor but if I
can save the hassle, why not?  Muir alludes to a Bardahl treatment of some
kind and I remember an emergency fix of pulling off the rocker arms and
banging on the valve with a mallet.  Are these mere fantasies and as such,
replacement heads are in my future?

And what caused this problem?  There were only about 27,000 miles on these
heads before the problems were first noted.  Doesn't that seem to be a bit
quick?  I can't say how the P.O. drove it over the first 23,000 miles but
there is a receipt that indicates he needed new plug wires at 16,000 because
he drove around with a broken fan belt and they melted.  On the other hand,
compression was fine when I got it and I didn't start seeing repeated problems
with the 1, 2, and 4 exhaust valve clearances until I had been driving it for
a while.  Not a good reflection at all on my claimed VW savvy and decades of
experience...

Thanks, as usual, for your sage advice.
