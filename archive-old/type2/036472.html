Subject: scraping-FR wheel-70

The scraping started Friday afternoon.  I rolled down the windows and 
determined it was coming from the right front wheel.  Wheel was not hot, so 
bearings should be fiine, but I pulled wheel and drum to inspect.  Newish 
grease, both bearings and seal 
look great.  I regreased, and readjusted.  

Upon spinning the drum the bearings sound perfect, although I hear a rubbing 
from the drum against I guess the backing plate.  Of course louder the faster 
I go and higher pitched.  Drum appeared fine to my untrained eye.

Warped drum?

Any comments appreciated.
