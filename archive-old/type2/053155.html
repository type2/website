OK folks.  There really are two ways to do it:  Steve Dolan has the plan
nicely scanned in (check out the link below) and you can print it from
there.  It comes out a little grey, but readable.

But unless I get a retraction from anyone (don't be shy), I'll mail off a
hardcopy to everyone who asks within the next week.  Just be patient and
I'll have them out in about a week.

There have been several requests for the CAD file, but I'm going to defer
for now.  But obviously, fix it up however you like.  I'd like to know what
modifications you all make that help.

And an extra copy goes to the first person to mount a coffee cup holder on
it.

&gt;I been a bit busy... I got the plans scanned this evening and they are at:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/dolly_small.jpg
&gt;and
&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/dolly_big.jpg
&gt;
&gt;the first is 103K and fine for seeing and printing at home.  The second is
&gt;*huge* (4.2 meg)  and for those with access to professional facilities.
