I replaced the front shift linkage bushing, as well as the shift coupler,
in my '71, this cleared up my problem of a hard to find 2nd gear.
Had to visit the actual VW dealer to find the bushing (was only a
buck or two!).

Hope this helps,

SNIP^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The next thing to tackle is the shift linkage -- I'm having the
classic hard shifting down into 1st-2nd, and into reverse. I replaced
the rear cage awhile back, so either that's not adjusted properly
or the front thingy (shift plate) needs attention.

Does anyone have a good procedure on adjusting the linkage? I just
remember the post about the guy who payed the local guru $50 to
deal with it and avoid the aggravation.  I'll pull the Bentley this
afternoon and see what he has to say.

OBTW...someone just walked by my office door and commented that I
looked a lot less cranky this morning....I guess it shows!
