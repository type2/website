Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

That is the kind of valve i have been looking for. Unfortunately the 
FL205 is natural gas.  Right below it is FL206 which is gasoline.  !/8&quot; 
fitting.  Called the local supplier and got the flow rates and 
pressures.  Flow rate for use from the fuel tank side was not enough.

&gt; This valve is designed for gasoline and is 12volts and has a 1/4&quot; 
&gt; fitting which I believe is big enough for our needs. They have a 
&gt; normally open and a normally closed valve. I will be buying the 
&gt; normally closed so when I turn the key on it opens unless my &quot;secret&quot; 
&gt; toggle switch is in the off position.
&gt; I think the price was less than $50 and cheap insurance against gravity 
&gt; fed gasoline fires where the fuel line ruptures and the fuel continues 
&gt; to flow out due to gravity thus creating a bigger fire.
&gt; Also would be a useful theft deterrent - separate switch to interrupt 
&gt; the current to this valve when you want a little extra protection - put 
&gt; a hidden toggle switch in the camper cabinets out back or under the 
&gt; seat pedestals.
