Having heard about cot's for the cab area, does any-one have one for sale in
the UK? Or can you e-mail a diagram/photo? since I need to think about what
to do with Cameron when he's older.


Having just had Cameron &amp; &quot;Mr Whipy&quot; being back on the road on the 23rd of
July, we went through the &quot;Sell or not to sell&quot; bit. But then we remember
the good times spent &amp; all the home comforts we enjoy when away. The thought
of going away on a &quot;Package holiday&quot; &amp; spending 2 weeks on a beach doing
nothing, makes my blood run cold! Much nicer to pitch up on site &amp; if you
don't like it find another. Want to go when the whether is good &amp; not when
it's crap- fine. Anyway we're resolved to go 'bussin' every 2 weeks, until
the end of season. So if your in the UK in September, we'll see you _at_
'Vanfest'.
