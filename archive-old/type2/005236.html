Well we are on this topic,,,
The glass on my louvered windows won't stay closed anymore,,,, blew open  at
9000 feet when I was in the la veta pass Colorado,,,, coming home from Buses
By the Balloons , which was a great show BTW :-)
I have them held closed with 90mph tape now....  but i'd love to repair
them.
Do you have to drill out some rivets,
Are the parts Available to replace,,,

Subject: Stiff louvered window crank


&gt;One of my louvered windows opens/closes smoothly while the other one is
&gt;pretty stiff.  I looked at it and don't see any obvious way to lube it.
&gt;Is there a way to get some lube in there and what kind of lubrication
&gt;would be preferable? Thanks.
