&gt; Put wife in bus.

Oooh, bad news!  You should put her _in_ the plane (old George Carlin
joke)

&gt; Let wife fly home.
&gt; I drive back to Texas via Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, on
down
&gt; towards home.

We'll be in the same vicinity at the same time, so if you see a green
bus with ham plates and an antenna farm on top send &quot;hi&quot; on the horn
and we'll have an eyeball QSO!
