Subject: Question on Valve Adjusting...
Message-ID: &lt;378D7DE0.5C44_at_shore_dot_net&gt;

I recently bought a 1973 VW Bus in Eugene, Oregon, and drove it all the
way back to Boston.  

A good friend back in Eugene gave me John Muir's Book:  How to keep your
Volkswagon Alive - A manual of Step by Step Procedures for the Complete
Idiot.

One of the first things I did when I got to Boston, besides changing the
oil, was to adjust the valves on all 4 cylinders.  I followed the
directions as stated in the manual (keeping in mind that I may actually
have a 1974 1800cc Engine in this bus).  To my delight, it seemed to
turn out well, and my bus ran much cooler and had smoother more lively
acceleration than before.  

When I went to make my adjustments, I found that the valves were way too
tight (I adjusted them from COLD - leaving he Bus parked overnight
before working on it, and found that I had to losen the valve adjustment
screw 2 or 3 turns on each valve just to get a gap to work with).  I
made my adjustments to .006   After I made my adjustments, to my
delight, my bus ran better, and cooler but the Idle was much faster.

I recently took my vehicle into for repairs at a VW repair shop in
Somerville, MA to have them do a thorough check up on my bus to see what
will need to be repaired eventually.  I also had them check the timing
and adjust the idle so it was slower.  They mentioned to me that all my
valves were too loose.  They said they could tell because they sounded
loud.  So I had them readjust all the valves, dispite my hard work the
weekend before.  When I drove the bus away, it was quieter, but to my
horror, it ran much hotter and overheated a couple of times, and the
smooth accelleration I had dissappeared and now drags when I give it the
gas.   

Am I missing something here?  Are these guys right, or were my
adjustments OK in the first place?  Does anyone have some suggestions
for knowing what your engine is supposed to sound like or respond like
when the valves are adjusted properly?

Any advise would be much appreciated.   Thanks!
