I realize that I use the term charge loosely in my diatribe on ignition systems.
 I didn't intend it to mean the number of coulombs retained in a device, rather
the implication is the amount of magnetic field stored, as evidenced by the
magnitude of current flow through a device.  Charge doesn't even have to imply
anything electrical, so that when I have a full charge in my extinguisher, it is
fully ready to remedy the results of the my gas tank emptying itself of its full
charge (heaven forbid).  It is this context I was using when I said &quot;the coil
charges up to (hopefully) its maximum&quot;.  

So you see, it is possible to charge a coil to a steady state current flow,
charge a capacitor to a steady state voltage, charge my spritzer to capacity for
an ultra fizzy drink and charge my credit till it can't take any more :)

peace,
terry
