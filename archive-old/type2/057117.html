Subject: Re: commuting in the bus?

When I first got the '72 ten yers ago this month I used it for my daily
commute from Zanesville to Columbus, Ohio.  This is a distance of 60
miles each way.  I was using $8 of gas a day getting about 17 mpg with a
1600 dp that the DPO put in.  I would stop at the ATM Monday through
Thursday getting $10 out and put the $2 in change in the glove box and
then on Friday I had enough in it to pay for gas for that day.  I stopped
using it for the commute a few months later and started using my 1969
Impala Custom Coupe.  Gas mileage was the same but the Impala had heat! 
I still used it sometimes during the summer.

 I had to sell the Impala before I moved up here, as well as a '73
standard bus, and a 1972 Pontiac Luxury LeMans that was my wifes.  But we
did bring the Westy, an '81 diesel Rabbit and a '91 Sundance.
