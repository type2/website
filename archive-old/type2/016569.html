David:

You suggested:

&gt;will start on the cold start valve
&gt;and last a couple of seconds

I'd say that's unlikely, for two reasons.

One is that the cold start valve, when activated, would inject fuel for
more than just a few seconds.

The second is that Richard said:

&gt;I can repeat this indefinitely

and, if that is indeed the case, the cold start valve would eventually
not be activated at all and therefor would not be a factor.
