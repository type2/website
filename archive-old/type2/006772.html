try calling a non local dealer.  Or go in.   I have several time got parts 
for ACVWs at dealers, though sometimes they had to order it and it would take 
a few days to get there.  Pay in advance for special orders.  But the parts 
guy was glad that I would read off a part number.  Your local guy is grumpy, 
forget him,  call the next town.
