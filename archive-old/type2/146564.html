Subject: It's Alive!

Thanks to everyone who weighed in on ideas on my 79 Westy. Happy to say
early Saturday morning I got her to fire up and run. Fixed the major oil
leak by the oil cooler and now am just working on fixing some minor
leaks (push rod tubes). Turns out it was all minor electrical glitches
including a ground and some bent pins on the injector connectors that
was making it not run. Now I'm working on reassembling everything else
and getting a muffler so I can fine tune the engine without upsetting
the neighbors! Haha.

Thanks again and let's hope by next Spring we see her back on the road.
