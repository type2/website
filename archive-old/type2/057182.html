ok, I guess we're taking over #VW on EFnet untill irc.type2_dot_com is fixed

not that anyone hardly ever used it anyway, but at least now we have a
plan!

I am considering installing a spin on oil filter for my 71 Westy.  Does anyone have any recommendations?  Should I also consider a remote oil cooler?  I would like to remove the screen from my sump plate so I won't have to remove it during oil changes (studs are in bad shape).

Thanks,

Bryan
