Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 on clean metal &amp;gas tank innards?

I wonder with all this talk about gas tank problems if it's possible to 
make a plastic version (like some modern vehicles) of our old gas 
tanks.  It would seem you could make a mold from an existing tank and make 
a copy of it and that would cure the problems...(just dreaming)...

&gt;metal- 1. Is this apporved for continuous gas exposure by the co?  2. Is it
&gt;OK to use on clean metal or must it be &quot;rusty&quot;?
