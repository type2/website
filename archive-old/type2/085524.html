Subject: Re: [T2] Woe is me.

My 7 seater is  72.  Working on the engine is, what is the term? oh yes,
fun, like the games Twister is fun.  I have often found myself almost
completely inside the engine compartment for certain procedures.  But, it
really isn't that bad.  I agree with David that it is easier than most V8's
or FWD V6's to extract the spark plugs.  Everything is logical and
accessible and simple.

The carbs are easy to work on and once I got them dialed in, I have had ver=

good performance from them.  My idle shutoff solenoid had been disabled.  I=
f
you decide to replace your carbs, I will be interested in buying your old
PDSIT's from you.

The 72 has a lot of 1 year only issues.  But there are many things I like,
round bumpers, the PDSIT carbs, no emissions control devices.

Has anybody ever used 2 carburetor synchronizers simultaneously to sync the
carbs before?

&gt; So I am happily shopping for stuff at my favorite local dealer today. I
&gt; picked up some door handles and other broken stuff for my new baby.  When
&gt; the shop owner informs me that his mechanic refuses to work on my particu=
lar
&gt; year of westy.  And he proceeded to list the following &quot;known&quot; problems:
&gt;=20
&gt; 1. Throttle linkage wears out and creates a vaccuum leak on the dual carb=
s.
&gt;=20
&gt; 2. The engine is hard to access and therefore work on.
&gt;=20
&gt; His main bone of contention seemed to be the carb situation. He seems to
&gt; dislike the dual carbs with a passion. Maybe they stomped on his flower b=
ed
&gt; in a previous life. But anyway, I am a little disheartened, how big of a
&gt; deal is this? Opinions ideas? :-(
&gt;=20
&gt; Question #2, exhaust leak near the head on the driver's side. It doesn=B9t
&gt; look like its the head itself so I suspect the heat exchanger is cracked.
&gt; The question is, can this be done engine in the bus or do I need to yank =
it.
&gt;=20
&gt; And an update:
&gt;=20
&gt; To those whose had suggestions for the shifter and no reverse, thank you!
&gt; The shifter plate was out of adjustment and now everything is hunky-dory.
&gt;=20
&gt; Thanks.
