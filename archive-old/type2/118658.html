Subject: Another campout to consider

    The Bus Alliance of Long Island is hosting it's 4th annual campout
on June 11th to 13th.  Long Island, New York is conveniently located
on the southern edge of New England and the northern edge of the
Mid-Atlantic states.  It's a relaxing weekend where you can catch up
with old friends and make new ones.  The park is located right on the
water and is ideal for swimming, canoeing, and fishing.  Also, the
surrounding roads are good for bicycling if that's your thing.  From
here you can easily travel to the Hamptons, visit wine country, see
Long Island's historic Big Duck, visit historic towns and villages,
shop at the Tanger Outlets and do so much more. The Coleman outlet
store is a popular, nearby attraction and many campers have gotten
great buys on equipment.
