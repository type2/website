Subject: Re: [T2] fuel filler pipe #2

&gt; I have the fuel filler pipe out.  I got it out by cutting the old hose
&gt; off.  Now, I can't get the new pipe back together.  If I put the hose back
&gt; on the pipe before I place it in position, the pipe will not fit in the
&gt; access hole.  If I try to put just the pipe in then put the hose on, It will
&gt; not fit on.  This is a major PITA.  I am stuck.  Any ideas?

I enlisted the help of a friend.  He put the filler neck on the pipe same as
the original part we replaced and he fed it though the hole and held it with
correct orientation in order to secure it with the screws later.

While he did this I attached my new piece of hose to the pipe using a
screw-on action, then attached the whole assembly to the tank opening.

At this point some minor adjustments were required to get the hose, pipe and
neck into their original positions.
