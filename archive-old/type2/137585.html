Subject: Re: [T2] Stolen Emblem/MTV Pimp My Ride

Yeah, if memory serves me correctly, one of the Beastie Boys wore a big VW 
emblem on a chain around his neck in the late 80's.  Naturally, a rash of 
emblem stealing ensued.  This was back when Flavor Flav (from Public Enemy) 
was running around with clocks hanging from his neck.  Good times.
