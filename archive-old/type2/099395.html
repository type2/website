Subject: Re: [T2] problems with 68-70 directional switch

&gt;Well,  got my bus back from the shop, and after $570 spent, I came out 
&gt;with an inspected bus, with everything working. When it was in the shop, I 
&gt;was told that the directional switch was only working sometimes. My bus is 
&gt;a 69, and that particular switch is NLA.  They installed an aftermarket 
&gt;universal switch from NAPA. And let me tell you, it is the Gawdiest thing 
&gt;you ever saw. The switch was also installed on the right hand side, which 
&gt;I also did not like.  Anyway, after driving three hundred miles on a trip 
&gt;this weekend, the flasher unit for this switch has stopped working.  Just 
&gt;a steady light now when the switch is used.  I have the old one, and am 
&gt;wondering if it can somehow be rebuilt.  Even the emergency flasher switch 
&gt;is bypassed with this abomination. Should I start searching the auctions, 
&gt;and vintage parts houses?

Don't give up hope on finding one.  The directional switch on our 71 Westy 
gave up the ghost.  (Same for 68 - 71 model years)  If available, I was 
getting quotes for it anywhere from $150 - $170.  Last week, my wife and I 
went on a quest for this holy grail.  We spent a day just hitting every 
junkyard and VW shop that we thought might have it.  In the afternoon, we 
found one.  The shop that had it just pulled it off a parts bus that they 
had in the back and sold it to us for $30.00!

&quot;In Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias they had  warfare, terror, 
murder and bloodshed but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and 
the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love; they had five 
hundred years of democracy and peace and what did that produce? The cuckoo 
clock.&quot;   --- Orson Welles (Harry Lime's speech in &quot;The Third Man.&quot;, 1949)
