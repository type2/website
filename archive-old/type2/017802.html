&gt; GUYS! Let's be a bit responsible, ok? Possibly the notion of checking

&gt; thing to suggest, no?

    Actually, the way I always check for propane or natural gas leaks
*is* with a lit match. That's after putting the pipes/hoses/connections
together, you light a match a run the flame around each and every joint.
Gasoline - no. You can see those leaks anyway. 
    You mean you don't grease your brakes? I always put a good thick gob
of axle grease on my front brake rotor when I hear that metal on metal
sound of a gone pad -- it stops the rotor from getting ruined until I
can replace the pads.
