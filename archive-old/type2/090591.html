Subject: Floor panel patch

List,
I have three small circular holes in the floor panel
of my '73 westfalia. They were, presumably,
poop-shoots at one time, or perhaps some option that
my bus does not have now. They are located directly
behind the driver's seat, between the two mounts to
the suicide seat. The previous owner patched them up
with a piece of plywood. Now, I'm dealing with a
little rust, but nothing horrible. I have access to a
MIG-welder. I do not know what to use to patch up the
floor. I've checked at the local machine shop for some
corregated steel, but came up empty-handed. Are floor
patching kits available? Has anyone done this and have
some experience to share? Can someone mail me a piece
of their floor?         
                                    Thank you,
                                    Paul Deatherage
