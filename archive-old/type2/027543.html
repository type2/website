Subject: Re: [T2] engine door seal

I ordered the part number from Bus Depot that Andy posted (as always, thanks 
Andy).  I should have it on Friday and I will post my install experience 
sometime this weekend.  I also ordered a &quot;new&quot; hatch latch from Joe at 
BustedBus.  Too bad the locking one I got from him 6 months ago is wrecked.  
Joe is really responsive and seems to know me by voice these days.  
Sometimes I wonder if he thinks, &quot;Oh no, that john from Cali again...&quot; but 
he is always cheerful and has supplied many parts that I was unable to find 
in my local yards.

&gt;&gt;If you do go the one piece route and get a good one, I'd appreciate 
&gt;&gt;hearing from you about it.  I'd still like to find a good one piece seal.
