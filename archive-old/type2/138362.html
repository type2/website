Subject: Re: [T2] tranny = engine longevity?

&lt;&lt; While at work today I (finally) pieced together that a good way to keep 
rpms
down and advance engine longevity is to get a five gear tranny. Can anyone
confirm this? Gimme the whys, too, including recommendations.

There are really only three things you need to get a five speed tranny in 
your Bus...A well-oiled pen and fully-loaded checkbook...If these two things
are in good repair, then it follows as the night the day, a Porsche tranny
will follow... ;-)
