I'd pass on that J.C.Whitney sells them.  So if your lazy and have the
bread, go for it.


I bought some of these from Whitney for my '72.  Haven't used them yet,
because when I trial fit them, they didn't line up very well.  I think the
sideview mirror was in the way.  Luckily they're a little oversized, so I'll
probably trim 'em down and rework them.  Problem is the magnetic strip is
sewn to the screen, and I don't know if my sewing machine is up to the task
of resewing them.  Hot melt glue may be just the ticket.  Thanks for the
recipe Mike.
