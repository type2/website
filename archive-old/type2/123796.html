forgot link
 
Here you can see the jack in action.
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/spareVWtire.htm

You store it in several places, in a bay (you can store it in the back
under a hard plastic cover that holds the spare tire., In my westy I
store it under the passenger front seat. 

 

&gt;My bus did not come with a jack. I have not seen any documentation

stating what kind of jack to use or where to put it. &gt;I have been using
the floor jack, but I don't want to take that on a trip. Is it a scissor
jack? Where is it stored?
