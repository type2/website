Subject: Re: [T2] Re: bus middle seat - will '77 fit '71?

&gt; I'm sure more than a few listees know, but I'm clueless...are middle
 bench seats interchangeable between a '77 and a '71?

Yes, but...... the 71 will not have headrest holes. These came along in 73.
68 to 79 middle seat mounting were all the same. There are 3/4 and full width seats. The full width seats are
tough to find.
