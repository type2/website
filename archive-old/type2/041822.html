closest to the front of the *bus* on the right side is # 1 and, behind that
toward the rear of the *bus* on the same side is # 2
and, on the left side of the *bus* closest to the front is # 3 and toward
the rear of the *bus* on that same side is # 4.  That's as fast as I can
go.......

&gt; Hello everyone.  I am in the middle of adjusting my valves after replacing
&gt; the push rod tube seals   and I am following the bentley guide but it
&gt; doesn't tell which cylindar is what number.  Can someone please tell me
