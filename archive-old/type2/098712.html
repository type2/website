As far as I know, no. But you don't need them :). The t4 style engine
pushrod tubes can be removed with the heads in place. I would just
order a set of the viton rod seals &amp; replace them all. It's very easy
&amp; mostly painless. Basically the steps are this:

1. Remove the valve covers.
2. unbolt the rockers &amp; remove the pushrods.
3. the tubes just slide back out of the head.
4. replace the tubes w/ new seals on.
5. replace pushrods.
6. replace rockers &amp; adjust valves.
7. replace valve covers.
8. enjoy adding oil less often :)
