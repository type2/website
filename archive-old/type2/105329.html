Subject: Re: [T2] Proper Bulbs for a Vanagon

Hi Tom,

I'm no Vanagon expert as I've always had bays but the numbers look a bit odd to me; you list the same bulb for front turn signals as for stop/tail lights.

Is that a typo or does a California spec Vanagon use the front indicators for sidelights too?

The indicator light on the dash will usualy flash faster if one of the front rear pair on a side is blown. So for a single filament bulb it may simply be that you are using the wrong wattage bulb - look at the writing on the bulb and compare with the old one or the one on the otherside.

If its a twin filament bulb then perhaps you have fitted it 180 degrees wrong and turning it round may solve your problem.

A working bulb from the other side and but in the fast flashing side to see if problem is the same.

At worst you may have to go back to your FLAPS and say that the bulb is wrong and you need one with the same wattage markings as for the other side.

Good luck
