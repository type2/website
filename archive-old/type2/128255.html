Subject: Re: [T2] In Which Changeable Tire Names Lead to Difficulty

Stephen,

&gt; What &quot;C&quot; rate tires have people been able to find
&gt; recently?

I just bought 185/14 Michelin Agilis 81 tyres for my
'71 Westfalia, expensive, but they're great, have a
pretty aggressive Mud+Snow tread, C-Rated, 8-ply..

You can also get Agilis 61, which is the 6 ply, with a
less aggressive tread.. Don't know if they're any
cheaper though.. I got my 81's at Sears (they had to
order them, took 3 days) but I think TireRack might
have Agilis too..

Good luck, and remember you get what you pay for!
