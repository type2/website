&gt;You can look high and low and you will not find an m9 x m8 stud to replace
&gt;the dealer part, I have tried, believe me. If I could find an alternative to

&gt;the dealer ones.

I don't think Dave was suggesting the studs would be found at Ace.

From my own experience I find they have a poor selection of metric and the prices are unreasonably high compared to other hardware chains, like OSH.

I have to rely on www.olander_dot_com (local company) for metric and even they can't carry it all (sometimes they will special order items). www.mrmetric_dot_com is another local vendor but they haven't been as useful and Olander.

Has the Porshe dealer run out of N-014-684-1?
