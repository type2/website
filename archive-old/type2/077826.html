&gt;Can we just compromise and say that timing is based on both engine and
&gt;distributor?
&gt;
&gt;All VW engines want about 30 degrees of total advance, but
&gt;different distributors are set at different static timing settings to get
&gt;this full advance value.  Don't blindly follow Bentley or any other
&gt;reference.  Get a timing light, mark 30 degrees on your pulley and make
&gt;sure that you get that value at full advance.

This follows the Muir principle ( remember him, he wrote a book for Compleat Idiots :)
wherein you set you timing at the top ( full advance, all in, etc.... ) and let the bottom
go where it does, and if you don't like it, get another dizzy. No complicated formula, or
searching for the elusive # in the dark, at the back of the distributor, under 30 years
of corrosion and grime, then finding a chart with the &quot;correct&quot; specs.,etc....
This formula will bypass all modifications and render you dizzy matched to the job.
