It was cold, it was wet, it was muddy, it was GREAT!

Chris Slaymaker rolled into Roan Mountain about 9:00 PM Thursday night. He
got lost on the way to the house, and went to the clinic. I pulled in about
the same time to see an emergency, and he had the pleasure of assisting in
surgery. :-(  After that I had to pack! Always the last minute camper.

Friday AM Boyd Smith showed up and a carabus of three headed to E-bus 2000.
We opted go skip Boone, NC and do the blueridge parkway thing. Almost got
socked in the fog as it was so thick on Grandfather Mountain. I forgot to
top off my leaky brake fluid, and had to radio Chris that I was pulling over
so that he would not blindly follow me into the pulloff and rear end me! Yep
that thick. While there, I changed fuel canisters in the propane heater to
keep the girls warm. I took Toots, Ted, and Alice.

When we got back on 421, I saw Anthony Pate at a restaurant out of the
corner of my eye and radioed that we needed stop and bring him in the
carabus. When we got there, it turned out that he was not going, but had a
noise in the rear and had the bus up on a jack. We diagnosed a bad bearing,
and he went to get that fixed and we headed on. Found out later he spent his
&quot;mad money&quot; on that and could not come to the event. Bummer.

Arrived at E-bus in rain, but very glad to be there. The crowd was thin, and
figured no one would come due to the nasty weather. Well, I was wrong. What
if you hold an VW event, and Everyone came?! Busses kept rolling in all
afternoon into late that night. I was amazed. Much bigger than last year
when the weather was beautiful.

I put up a clothes line inside the bus and kept the electric heater on to
dry out the girls socks. It was that wet.

On the way back Chris an I had a long pull up the mountain. We got hot, but
not &quot;too&quot; hot, and the combination of the heat and my oil leak made for a
good picture of a smoky bus at an overlook on the blueridge parkway. Gotta
pull that engine to see where is coming from!

I'll not mention names as to not offend those I will forget, but the east
coast and Canada were well represented.

Thanks Cybulski for another wonderful E-Bus!!
