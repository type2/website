Subject: Buying Parts from Overseas (outside U.S.)

Apologies to non-U.S. subscribers.

&gt;From time to time I come across opportunities to buy parts from other
countries - Australia, UK, Germany, France, etc.  These vendors will
ship internationally and the transaction can be done via credit card. 
All just as convenient as from a U.S. supplier.

However, I have to date only purchased publications this way, which were
delivered via mail.

I'd like to know if any listees have every purchased parts (i.e.
cylinder heads, etc.) from outside the U.S. and, if so, was there any
kind of U.S. Customs hassle?

Or is there a dollar value limit below which items are exempt.

Thanks in advance,
