Subject: Re: [T2] Westy %&amp;*^&amp;!!!! rollerbearing on my bottom front hinge!

&gt; The roller bearing that takes all the weight of my door (the vertical
&gt; bearing) at the leading edge of the door decided to seperate into various
&gt; parts and that is why my door fell off!!! I opened it today to look, and the
&gt; big outside piece is there, but the inner bits that I'm assuming held it on
&gt; are gone to who knows where!!! Anyone got a spare one of these laying about
&gt; that is in good shape? My California Imports Catalogue lists the same
&gt; bearing as from 68 to 79 so they must be the same piece for all bays. It
&gt; looks like they must be made of pure platinum as the new price is bloody
&gt; ridiculous.

wheee!  checked the price in Bus Depots catalog and just about fell over,
better start grabbing that part when I hit the junk yards

   hmmm better check the box of sliding door parts I have in the garage
