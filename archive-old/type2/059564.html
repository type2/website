Joe,
I'm planning on using an el cheapo stereo and hooking it up to my Realistic 40
watt amp.  Also I'm going to just mount a portable cd-player somewhere, and
hook it into it.  That way I can hide it when I go down to Yonkers and so on.
I'm planning on getting 2 6x9 in the front and back.  As well as a bass tube
under the couch in the back.  I'll keep everyone updated on the &quot;Ghetto
Cruiser&quot; status.
Thanks,
Capt Tripps
