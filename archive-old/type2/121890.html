&gt;What are people using to remove the large snap/lock ring on VW cranks? I

&gt;pliers to remove and replace the &amp;*(^&amp;!!!!!!!  lock ring that keeps the
&gt;timing gear and dizzy gear on? All anyone around here has are those whimpy
&gt;little snap ring pliers with pins on them.

Your friendly local neighbourhood snap-on driver will be study pliers for this task as a reasonable price.

I'm not suggesting you spend this much money on a pair of pliers but it's interesting to see the vintage style of tool VW used that's also depicted in Bentley:
