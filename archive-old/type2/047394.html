Subject: [T2] trip

I am going on a trip in ten days time bus is ready now I am going through
France, down the east coast of Italy to the bottom and then on a Ferry to
Greece.
Have any of you fellow Dubbers done this trip or doing it as I want to meet
as many of you as possible on this trip so where are the best place's to go,
I will follow the coast I expect hoping to find some surfer's and learn to
surf.
Also I have a palmtop to take with me so how do I go about getting an ISP
for these countrie's and how do I access this list because it could be handy
if I hit problems
Thank's Banny
