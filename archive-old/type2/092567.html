Subject: Gas leakage into oil

1977 2.0 FI, automatic transmission, weekender package

We are experiencing a fairly significant leakage of raw fuel into the oil, 
as indicated by odor and increasing fuel level on the dipstick.

   What should we be checking for first? (and how?) From reading manual,
   perhaps the cold start valve, or fuel pressure regulator should be the first
   suspect items, but we're really not sure where to begin.

   Thanks,

   Freya
