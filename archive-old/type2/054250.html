&gt; Just got done with the new radio installation in my bus.  My wife gave me
&gt; a very fancy Icom 706 Mk II G ham radio for father's day, and I finally
&gt; got around to installing it in the '71 bus.  This installation could be
&gt; called an &quot;extreme&quot; job, since the radio works on everything from 440MHz
&gt; all the way down to 1.6Mhz.
&gt; the UHF and VHF frequencies are no problem, since the wavelength is larger
&gt; than the car and the roof rack acts as a good ground plane.  I ran into
&gt; big problems trying to get the antennas (Hustler Super resonators on 40
&gt; and 80 meter bands) to match at the lower frequencies, particularly at
&gt; 3.8MHz.  A wire antenna cut for 3.8MHz is over 100 feet long, so getting a
&gt; resonant antenna on a vehicle is a bit of a challenge of coil-winding!

WOW!,  Some guys have all the luck.  You must have been exceptionally nice to
your wife for a gift like that ;-)).

An old work friend of mine designed an unusual bunch of coils, sticks and
spikes and ran around for years with the contraption attached to his bug.
Dang antenna made looked like it was going cause the bug to start doing
wheelies at any time.  He may have some diagrams that he can share with you
about making a multi-band single antenna which may or may not be of help to
you.  One thing I remember about making up mobile antennas, is that they are a
tinkerers paradise and there is always &quot;just one more change&quot; to be made.
