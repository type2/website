You can use the static method of timing at any time. Unfortunately, it 
doesn't show &quot;slop&quot; in the distributor (ie variations in the timing).

For a static timing light, you can get by on the cheap. My first light 
cost about 2 cents, using recycled materials. I took an old tail/stop 
lightbulb (one filament was burned out), soldered a couple wires to it 
(one to the side, the other across the contacts). On the ends of the 
leads, I dug up a couple small aligator clips from the scrap box, and 
attached them (not necessary, but handy). A quick wrap with electrical 
tape, and everythings ready. A couple years later, after a wrench broke 
the first light, I got fancy. I salvaged an old turn signal socket, 
complete with wires, and inserted it into a plastic tube. The bulb was 
now replacable.

I used it to time my VWs and motorcycles for years. When it was lost 
during a move, it wasn't a big loss.

As for a timing light, get a battery assisted model (attaches to the 
vehicle's battery). They are much brighter, and quicker to light (more 
accurate) than the really cheap models (these use a &quot;glow tube&quot;). 
Generally, the better models are more expensive, but even the cheapest 
will do the job. My current light probably cost under $25 when new, but 
I picked it up at a garage sale for under $5. Considering points only 
need to be adjusted/replaced every 10K (most cars), and electronic 
ignitions every 25K, this tool doesn't really get a lot of use.

Either can be used, but the fancier model can help you see when problems 
are beginning to occur. If the timing mark &quot;jumps&quot;, this can indicate 
problems... an irratic idle, or play in the distributor timing (for 
various reasons). Static timing also requires close attention to detail, 
to get it &quot;just right&quot;... while the dynamic method is easier to set 
exactly.
