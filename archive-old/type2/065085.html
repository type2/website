&gt;&gt;Schwartze makes a good point that if the oil temp is lower it could be
&gt;&gt;because the oil is absorbing less heat, due to a lower rate of heat
&gt;&gt;absorbtion ( I can't think of the correct term here).  However, if the oil
&gt;&gt;has the ability to absorb heat quickly it also has the ability to dump
&gt;&gt;heat quickly, therefore showing a lower temp than an oil with a lower
&gt;&gt;absorbtion/dump rate.
&gt;oil cooler, then I would assume lower temperature means it transfers heat
&gt;better.  If before the cooler, then I would assume lower temperature means
&gt;it doesn't transfer heat as well. My sender measures oil temp in the sump,
&gt;which is more or less before the cooler, so I'm still going with &quot;doesn't
&gt;transfer heat as well&quot;.  Of course, I'm not very confident in my
&gt;determination, and I'd love to be proven wrong.  :-)

 The question does make you think for a while. . . . but then my head
starts to hurt.

 I want to throw a couple ideas out.

 To lower the heat coefficient of anything you would have to decrease 
the density. As in molecules farther apart.

 If you do that, you will decrease the viscosity. 

 It is easily proven with even water that the addition of minerals, 
chemicals, even salt will raise the coefficient of heat in a fluid.

 What I propose is that even this Kendall should have a higher heat
value. 

 What is surprising is that any product shows any remarkable
difference for any reason.
