It did it from the start. I was hoping it was my imagination. No such luck.
It is mild but is there.

No pinging. CR 7.5:1
I guess I need to pull the plugs to see what they look like!

&gt; &gt;My 300 mile engine is running too hot I fear. On the hills 240+ (I stop
and
&gt; &gt;cool down at 240). I received an e-mail last night that recommended I
retard
&gt; &gt;the timing a bit to run cooler. I time it at 28 degrees max advance. Vac
&gt; &gt;advance distributor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Then today I found this in the archives:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The biggest problem I find with VW's is the use of a timing light to
set
&gt; &gt;the timing of a non-stock engine. On a weekly basis I have VW's coming in
&gt; &gt;the shop complaining about heat and/or running problems, after I look at
it
&gt; &gt;the first thing I do is advance the timing a few degrees and that usually
&gt; &gt;solves the problem. Most non stock VW engines that I see are running to
&gt; &gt;retarded, which in turn causes them to run hot. The only time I use a
timing
&gt; &gt;light is to check the timing after I have set it by ear, so I know where
to
&gt; &gt;set it if I need to make changes to something and to check the advance if
&gt; &gt;the dizzy. Using a timing light to set the timing on a NON STOCK engine
is a
&gt; &gt;NO NO, but to each there own. &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What is the answer?
&gt;
&gt; Hear any pinking at all??? No?? Still could be too high compression from
&gt; not verifying deck height during assembly. Could also be just running too
&gt; lean. How did you adjust the mixture??? Float level too low will lean you
&gt; out = heat. So would a vacuum leak. A weak fuel pump that can't keep up
&gt; will likewise drop the fuel level in the carb and lean you out = heat.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Another subject: There definitely is a rpm dependant vibration in the
beast.
&gt; &gt;Pisses me off as I spent a lot of money having the whole thing balanced
&gt; &gt;before I assembled it. How long till this engine flies apart?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A few possibles: fouled plug, cracked plug insulator, bad HT wire, cracked
&gt; dizzy cap, valve lash closing up, cylinder studs
&gt; cracked/stretching/pulling, piston installed 180° wrong, head seal going
&gt; south due to unparallel machining of either the case or head or mismatched
&gt; cylinder shims. cracked or burned valve or piston or head from
overheating.
&gt;
&gt; Check and proof the ignition first, then the fuel system. If that's all
&gt; good, teardown is probably required to find the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Note if it ran smoothly for 200 miles then developed the vibration, it's
&gt; not a problem with the balancing work. If it was out of balance initially
&gt; it would have vibrated from initial startup.
