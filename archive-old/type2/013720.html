Subject: FS 84 Sunroofer Weekender (western WV) 2400 obo 
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Selling a two tone blue 84 GL w/ weekender seats
including sofa/bed and rear mattress (out
of a wolfsburg--says westphalia on it but Chris Jordan
says it's not a wolfy westy because it's full width)
Also have the curtains, but the snaps are not mounted
on the van.  160k miles.  4speed.  Has the hot idle
flicker.  Slight rust in the usual spots and two end
caps missing like every other vanagon around.  New
load rated tires.  Recent exhaust complete, brake
work, coolant hoses, FI sensors, new gas tank.  

Purrs nicely.  Fun daily driver, great for sunny days
on the beach and camping.  

Have lots of parts and a cool old-school looking
luggage rack probably off an old loaf.  If ya bargain
me down to far, I'm gonna keep it for that 71 I may by
when I hit the lotto.  

I planned a full restoration.  The wife planned on
something with A/C and A/T.  She won and says it's
time for Old Blue to go.  

It is perfect for those who want to add a poptop. 
Just drive a little farther up the road and snatch
that free one Anderson is trying to give away.  No
cutting the hole!

$2400 or best offer.  I'd prefer to sell it to a
youngster wannabusser who cannot yet afford that
pristine 91 Syncro Westy that we all lust after. 
I purchased it off this list and it tells me it would
prefer another listmember owner.   

I'm in Huntington, WV.  About 1.5 hours from
Lexington, KY and 2 hours from Columbus, Oh.
