&gt; Last friday my bus died on the way home from work luckily close to home. Sure 
&gt; enough the points burned out. So i put new points and condensor in double 
&gt; checked the gap and timed it statically. She still wouldn't fire so i checked 
&gt; the coil and it was bad. After replacing the coil checking the fuel pump and 
&gt; everything that makes that little 1600 go i was baffled. I had to do the 
&gt; inevitible and get it towed. So today now monday i stopped by the shop to 
&gt; find my bus all set and ready to go. The mechanic told me the wire running 
&gt; from my points to the condensor was grounding out on the distributor. So i 
&gt; thought o.k. no big deal i just overlooked that and this obvious easy fix and 
&gt; it shouldn't cost me to much. Think again 85 bucks! including the 50 dollar 
&gt; diagnostic charge. Next time my bus is going to sit in the driveway until i 
&gt; figure it out myself. Thanks for letting me vent. I would like to hear some 
&gt; similar stories if anybody has any. 

Yes, that bill was a bit high for a grounded-out wire, but what you paid
for was the knowledge involved in tracing the problem.  You wouldn't think
twice about paying an equal amount to a doctor or dentist for the same
amount of their time.

You're also paying for the mechanic's overhead and for the time he has to
spend filling out paperwork.  The mechanics have to eat too, and they 
would like their families to live in reasonable conditions.

I do what I can myself, but if I have to call upon the services of a
professional I expect to pay them a fair amount for their services.
