Subject: Re: [T2] Diagnostic Expertise Needed - mystery solved!

Well, I ordered a new AMC head earlier today (from
GoWesty_dot_com in the end - the price they gave me was
great, and I have some history with them. I've yet to
encounter any VW sales people more friendly,
knowledgeable and helpful). 

Anyway - with the head on its way, I pulled the old
one, and looked at the offending exhaust valve. It
looked perfect - not bent, not receded, not burned -
nothing. I was just about to despair, when I noticed
the inlet valve - it had receded, and was sitting with
its face flush with the surface of the head.  I looked
in the back of the inlet port, and could see a &quot;roll&quot;
of metal that had been hammered out in a ring behind
the valve seat. I took the valve out, and the seat was
loose in the head. 

I said in my original post that the exhaust valve was
shorter than the intake - but the truth was that the
intake was *longer* than the exhaust - makes all kinds
of sense, in retrospect (but them most things do....) 
So - mystery solved, and it looks like we still might
make or vacation (better not speak too soon :-)

As an aside - gowesty recommend re-machining the AMC
heads and fitting better valves even when new (as a
couple of list members had already suggested), but my
vacation time constraints precluded this option. I'm
thinking I might drop the engine in a month or two,
and at that time buy another new AMC, get both of them
machined together, and do the job properly

In case anyone else is planning anything similar, I
can verify that getting the right-hand head off
without dropping the engine is a piece of cake - took
me 2-3 hours, working slowly. I hope the reverse is
true...

Thank you all again for your advice

Matthew
