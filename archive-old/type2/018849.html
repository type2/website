Subject: vent window rivits
Message-ID: &lt;37F3F25F.7343_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

I just replaced the seals on my vent windows - tedious, that flimsy
metal will bend too damn easily.

I used 4mm aluminum &quot;medium&quot; grip rivits from the Home Depot and put a
nylon washer between the 2 pieces of hinge.  It's not &quot;stock, but it
works.  I had purchased 2 stainless rivits from a boat store, but they
were too small in diam.

Another listee stated that Wolfsburg West (??) has the original rivits.
good luck

-Next question. I had to tear down the vent windows for seals and
naturally 
had to drill the rivets. What is everyone using to replace them? I can
get 
stainless steel screws with tiny nuts and washers. However I would
prefer 
the stock arrangment. Any ideas?
