I put in one of those bilge blower fans like some of you on the list
recommended, on my '71 bus.  Works great!  Only thing is, it's a little
noisy, and I don't really need it blowing full blast all the time.  Can I
use some kind of fan switch with maybe 3 different settings?  Any
recommendations?  I looked at Bus Depot, but they list about 9 different
ones, with no pictures.

I also put a pair of those fog lights in, that CarParts was selling.  They
look and work really nice.

Been busy.  Thanks for all the great ideas!
