&gt;BTW - There are still 3 or 4 manuals (separate auctions) for the 68 -78
&gt;or 79 going on E-bay right now.  What are the differences in these
&gt;manuals?  I've seen 68-78 and 68-79.  Not to mention different markings
&gt;in the lower right hand corner of the front cover, some say Robert
&gt;Bentley (like mine) and the newer ones also have the price of $34.95
&gt;there as well.  Are there major differences in these manuals?

A manual that covers from '68-'7x was issued in 197x.  Anything after
'79 has all the stuff on the cover.  It is cool to pick up a manual of the
&quot;vintage&quot; of your bus if you can.  The only practical aspect is the old
manuals have full color wiring diagrams at least to '77 and I think actually
all &quot;real&quot; manuals sold till '81-'82 or so as that is when they stopped
in contemporary manuals.  However, if you buy a '68-'74 manual it
will only cover till '74, only dual carbs, and not 2.0, hydraulic lifters,
etc.  But for a '72 owner, it would be fine.

Hence the '68-'78 manual would be a real nice piece if it has color
diagrams and as it covers all buses almost, as would a genuine '79
manual but those are impossible to separate from all later prints unless
you ask about color diagrams.  Also the covers are thicker, as are all
the pages I think in all original manuals compared with the reprints.
