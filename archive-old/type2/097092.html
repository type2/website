Subject: Merry Christmas, so long and I'll be back (hopefully)

I want to wish everyone a happy holiday and hope your new year is great and
rust free.  I have a thesis to finish and medical boards to pass and need to
get focused on that for now.  Thanks to everyone on the list for all the
advice, info and wisdom.
Until later
peace
Steve Laughlin
