ALmost for sure you have GUNK sticking your throttle. The most likely 
places are at the exit of the ACCELERATOR cable and the throttle 
linkage and return spring. First, disconnect the throttle cable and 
check to make sure the carb itself is returning the throttle plate 
to idle setting. If that is just fine, it is probably excessive dirt 
and grease holding and sticking the cable.
