I have two breadloafs with powder coated front logos and all the bumpers and 
neither have chipped over many miles, years and stray rocks from gravel 
trucks.  In fact studys from certain powder coat manufactures have shown the 
metal to actually bend before the powder coat will come loose.  Now there is 
such a thing as cheap powder coat.  It is measured in a hardness scale 
similiar to that used for pencil lead.  I did buy some with poor results.  As 
far as chipping goes I would venture a guess that it was poor preparation.  
To remove old powder coat all you need to do is return to the sandblaster.

Of course this is only my opinion,  I could be wrong.
