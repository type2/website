&gt; &gt; It's the stupid stripped out intake stud. The small amount of JB I put

&gt; use a new unstripped stud,  put some steelwool (not soap kind, but
&gt; carpenters kind) very small amount, take your JB weld and put some into
&gt; the hole, now screw in the stud.
&gt;   go on vacation.  when you get back you should have a dern near good as
&gt; new stud.

For all this trouble, it seems to me that it would be better to either
install a stepped stud or an insert.

Despite its name, JB weld is simply an epoxy.  Epoxies cannot be expected
to maintain their strength at the temperatures experienced in a head,
even when reinforced with steel wool.

Do the job right and you won't have to do it again!
