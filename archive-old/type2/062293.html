        I just finished this job in my '82.  I used the Kit from Z-products
that Bus Boys (legal stuff) sells.  I thought that I would save a lot
getting the kit without the curtains (just the rods and mounting hardware),
I was wrong.  Have you seen the price of fabric, wow !(and I thought VOA
prices were high, for what you get(BTW: it takes seven yards)).
        My wife likes to sew (She made me a neat SCA costume) so it worked
out OK.  She said to figure at least  three hours for cutting and fifteen
hours to sew them (also apx. three hours to install them, you will need a
drill and will want a cordless screwdriver).
