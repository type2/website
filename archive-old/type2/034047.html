Except he's not looking for a ground short or any reason for blowing fuses.
He's looking for a possible intermittent open, a problem where the power
circuit seems momentarily &quot;disconnected&quot;.

Steve described that after warm-up his wipers and headlights system
returned to normal. This is indicative of a loose connection or defective
fuse contact point. The fastest way to diagnose the fuse as the problem is
to jumper the fuse. Jumpering also works anywhere you want to establish the
device in question does actually work. In that case it's just a matter of
testing where the power dropped out. Something he didn't want to get into.

Fuses do protect a circuit and device from overloading and ground shorts.

There are times when jumpering is a last resort to finding an elusive
ground short.

It's called &quot;smoke testing&quot; . Where the smoke is, is where the problem is
....sometimes.
