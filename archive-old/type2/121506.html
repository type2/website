Subject: Re: [T2] Friday topic: Dashboard

&gt;If you were going to update the dashboard in a bay, what would you add, 
&gt;remove, revise?

Additional instruments for tach (clock hole), cyl head temp, oil temp, and 
oil pressure in the area between the radio and ashtray. 3 two inch gauges 
will fit here... Be sure you want to cut your dash though... Looks stock.

Otherwise I am happy with the dash. Seriously considering revising the 
parking brake handle though. Want a floor mounted lever like my Honda CR-V.
