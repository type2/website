Subject: alternative air filter setup.


Hello again.

I have been considering replacing the air filter box on my fuel injected
type4 with a more modern &quot;performance&quot; air filter style. The kind you see
on those K&amp;N intake kits. 

My idea is to fabricate an adapter to connect it directly to the air flow
meter. the adapter would mount to either the side or top of the engine
compartment. Its basic purpose is to convert the square port on the AFM to
the round port on most of these style air filters. I've even considered
going as far as fabricating a pipe that goes from the throttle body to
the AFM,replacing that ugly boot that tends to leak air in.

The reason for this is to make more room in the engine compartment and
make things a bit more accessible in there.  It would also compliment a
detailed engine compartment nicely ;)

Can anyone think of why this would be a bad idea. I know these L-Jetronic
systems can be fussy when you alter the way they work (even if very
slightly).

thanks
