Subject: Re: [T2] What is this tube?

Looks like an archaic remnant of an STP smog device (EGR).
Saw tons of these things in the wrecking yards years back.

	Eron

&gt;Look just to the left of the fuel filter.
&gt;See the grey tube that has a cap screwed down on it?
&gt;What purpose did this tube serve ?
&gt;What did it used to connect to ?
&gt;
&gt;Engine is 1600 SP with 30pict1 carb.
&gt;
&gt;Tnx,
&gt;Bob Perring
