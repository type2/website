Subject: RE: New van; Revell model

Hello all,

        If all goes well, I will pick up my first Bus Saturday morning. It is a '77 and the owner 
has taken very good care of it. It comes from California and has only been in NE for 7 months. It 
has a recently re-built 2.0L engine, dual exhaust, new shifter with a hand grip, new stereo and 
other a bunch of other shit I can't remember as I have only seen it for about 15 minutes. As soon 
as I pulled up to this guys house, I knew I wanted it. Some guy offered him $200 dollars more 
than the price we agreed upon. He still is selling it to me, even though I couldn't afford to 
match the higher offer.

        The windshield needs replacing. How can I go about finding a replacement? Can I just call 
up a place that replaces windshields and expect them to have what I need? Also, the spare tire is 
mounted to the front and I want to get it off there and put the logo back on. Any suggestions as 
to how and where to store this spare? The cabinets in the back have been completely replaced with 
custom cabinets. Currently there is no place for the tire. 

        I can't wait to get this thing and start using it. I can finally take part in the 
ownership aspect of the list. Have been just an interested observer to this point.

        The bus is a camper but it isn't a Westfalia. It has a hard top. I think it had cabinets 
in the back, but I don't know to what extent. It is not a transporter. Can anyone tell me how 
this was originally equipped and also is there anyway I can find out what the original paint 
schemes were for the '77 model year?

        I happened to go to a hobby store in my area and found a &quot;Revell&quot; model of a bus all 
modified. The wheels were way oversized and the body was distorted like a caricature. The name on 
the box had the pattern of the US flag in it and the &quot;V&quot; was a hand in the form of the peace 
sign. I asked the clerk what the story was behind this model. he told me that &quot;Revell&quot; has 
reissued some old cars. I looked and found some of te same models I made as a kid over 20 years 
ago on the shelf. This bus was just too cool to pass on. There was also a bus with a Chevy engine 
that took up almost the entire cargo area. It came with a little mini-bike also. Does anyone out 
there remember these models? 

Thanks in advance,
