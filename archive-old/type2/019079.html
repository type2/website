IMHO, I don't think this is really off-topic -- the admins may or may
not agree. It's busses, and it's technical, I think. But with the colder
weather approaching (at least here in the States), I think these issues
need to be addressed. We may at the very least prevent some extremities
from getting frozed, and who knows? we may save some lives. I'm getting
a real education about heating issues in my bus.

I think a CO2 sensor is a fine idea, just on general principle,
considering the age of some of our vehicles. The first time I ran my
heater, it really smelled bad and I panicked about exhaust fumes until a
VW guy told me it's just the stuff blowing out from the heater not being
used in such a long time.

I depend as much on my nose as my ears with my bus. I gotta get some
gauges! :-)

&gt; With the advent of Carbon Monoxide alarms (I'm sure 12 volt models are
&gt; available at RV supplier - although I'll bet they're expensive), using one
&gt; if you are heating with gas would be a great idea.
