&gt;    Hi list,
&gt;    Engine is in tune, replaced alternator  six month ago, red light
&gt;would flash dimly with head lights on and turn signal on. Got tried of
&gt;that game finally and replaced starter last Thursday after after having
&gt;to jump start it. After changing the starter I had a bright red light(
&gt;!_at_$%^&amp;).
&gt;    Ok I say, Game is over. Out comes the wallet New Alt. New Reg. New
&gt;Batt.(all remanufactured of course). Cables were replaced Six month ago.

Including the ground strap at the front tranny mount??? If so, look for
parasitic draw, in many cases related to dirty battery or a stuck 30 year
old relay or a loose interior or dash light switch or rheostat or terminal
rubbing lightly on metal. Look for evidence of heat at any of the
terminals, particularly the unfuzed circuits but the fuzed ones as well.
Check the light switch and ignition switch terminals for sure. Follow the
melted insulation and irridescent purple terminals. Be sure to replace or
clean the bulb and bulb holder contacts for the alt/battery light itself.
