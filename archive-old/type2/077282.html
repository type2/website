Subject: RE: [T2] Jake Raby motor reviews ?

I guess I can jump in here, too. I count myself lucky
to have been around when Jake started some of the
experiments with the big T4's, so I've gotten to see
how this has developed. 

First, his T4 motors are put together with the same
sort of philosophy as the T1's, and the results are
amazing. I got to drive the Bluebonic Plague when it
had the 2316cc Type 4 in it, and I don't know that I
can find words to describe it. Neck-snapping torque,
acceleration like what I get on my motorcycles, and a
top end that I'd be frightened to reach. Even with the
additional work Jake's done on strengthening the car,
the power in that motor is slowly ripping that Beetle
to bits - tearing out the seat tracks, and actually
starting to split the pillars. The work Jake did just
to keep clutches in that car was impressive on its
own. 

Beginning sometime early next year (Yes, Jake, I'm
finally going to do it after talking about it for so
long), I'm going to have Jake build a big T4 for my
Ghia. Originally I was thinking 2316cc, but he's
always making innovations, and I'm going to let him
make suggestions to me. People who know me understand
that's not normally how I like to do things. 

Any engine, anytime, anywhere.

&gt; Anybody have any reviews on the Massive Type IV

&gt; I've also driven a number of the different T4
&gt; applications, and am going to have Jake build a
&gt; Massive Type IV for me next year, but since this
&gt; e-mail specifically talks about Type 1's, let me
&gt; talk
&gt; to those particular engines:
