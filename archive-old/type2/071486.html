Fuses blow because too much current is flowing.  You mention your timer 
switch.  If it is shorted it could cause a fuse to blow.  But I doubt that's 
it.
I would check to see what voltage is going to the battery.  If it's above 
about 14.5 volts this would cause more current to flow and thus blow fuses.  
I don't know how to adjust the charging voltage in you application.  If the 
voltage is too high you can put a limiting resistor in series with the 
battery.  (or even the fuse)  Maybe 1.5 ohms and 5 or more watts.  
These #'s are off the top of my head but they should be close.  If the 
resistor gets too hot use a higher wattage resistor if the fuse still blows 
increase the resistance.

&gt; I have been trying to fix this problem since I bought my bus over 5
&gt;  years ago.  I am hoping someone out there can give me some
&gt;  troubleshooting tips.  I have a 76 Westy with a refrigerator powered by
&gt;  the auxiliary battery and (or) a power converter.  I am pretty sure it
&gt;  has a battery isolator set up of some kind because the auxiliary battery
&gt;  will drain and leave the main battery charged.  The refrigerator works
&gt;  fine and cools nicely on both battery power and &quot;city power&quot;.  The
&gt;  alternator charges the auxiliary battery when the engine is running.
&gt;  The problem starts when I try to charge the auxiliary battery  using the
&gt;  power converter.  As soon as I turn the charge timer on the fuse inside
&gt;  the power converter door starts to get really hot and eventually blows.
&gt;  I had to have my power converter fixed because it fried the last time I
&gt;  attempted to work on this.  Well it is working OK now but there is
&gt;  obviously something very wrong somewhere.  I am wondering if it is not
&gt;  hooked up to the auxiliary battery correctly or maybe I have a wire
&gt;  shorting somewhere.  I know enough about electricity to operate
&gt;  (somewhat!) a voltmeter but that is about it. I am thinking maybe the
&gt;  timer switch is bad?  Is there any way I can test it?  Any specific
&gt;  things I should check?  Thanks in advance.
