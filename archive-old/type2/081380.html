Subject: fuel pump push rod

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I am trying to switch the stuff from my old engine onto my new AVP =
rebuilt. (probably have more questions in the future too)

 I want to use my good, old fuel pump. I removed it, but can't get the =
fuel pump pushrod out of the old case. Is there a trick or has it been =
flattened by the cam and impossible to get out?=20
