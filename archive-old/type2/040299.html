Subject: oil filter oil pump oil order?

On a '77 pancake what is the direction of oil flow in terms of oil filter,
oil pump, oil pressure sensor, bearings?  I'm trying to figure out why my
dipstick reads overfull sometimes and just right other times.  My oil light
only comes on when cranking the engine to start.  I'm going to change the
filter this weekend.

Thanks!
Christopher
