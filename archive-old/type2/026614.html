 The evaporative coolers (AKA swamp coolers) do indeed need dry outside air condition to work (like the previous post).  One option (for camping only) could be the small aerodynamic rooftop AC unit often seen on pop-top campers (by Coleman and others) available at all RV dealers (but good only for stationary, 110VAC situations).  It is somewhat large overall, but only needs a 14&quot;x14&quot; hole for mounting.  For running on the road, the engine-driven AC is probably the best alternative.  For retro-fits or other auto AC info try out Old Air products (www.oldairproducts_dot_com) that caters to the Hot Rod crowd or the professional auto AC site (www.aircondition_dot_com).
