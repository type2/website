Subject: Re: [T2] air scoops - which kind ?

Don't know who your friend in Oz is, but the VW Specialists I go to (Vintage
VeeDdub Supplies) get moulded plastic scoops made, which do keep the
temperatures down, in summer it's pretty hot out in the country, and I tend
to push Tigger a bit on trips, but she stays pretty cool on the go. As has
been noted, they don't add anything in stop start traffic, but they DO add
to your cooling air supply out on the road.

Pictures here if anyone's interested. http://neale_dot_org/images/tigger.html

&gt; &lt;&lt; I am pretty skeptical of any improvement by swapping 72+ intakes on a
71-
&gt;  bus. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; my friend in Australia makes the wider ones for the top scoops
&gt;
&gt; they do cool better . at least when its real hot........Outback tested !
