Subject: Cowl or Nose vent question

Vehicle: '78 Westy.

I am searching for a cowl vent coupler. Everything I am missing is tiny 
little dinky stuff these days.

There is a little nylon coupler that links the right and left flappers 
inside the cowl vent out front. The linkage to open and close the vents 
operates on the left flapper and this coupler links the right side to the 
left so they both open.

I have access to a '71 parts bus and if it is the same it is there. Would 
it fit?

I also have access to a '78 but it is 35 miles away in Crossville and I'm 
too lazy to make the drive... &lt;grin!&gt;

Can't seem to find this piece in ETKA.

Something to think about: I saw a '65/'66 Moostang in the University 
parking lot. It apparently had a leaking cowl vent (which on a car would 
get your feet wet). I also had a '66 Mosotang back in '86 or so (my first 
car) and it's cowl leaked too.

They make a plexiglass cover with a basic rubber seal to seal the cover to 
the cowl. It has two spring loaded clips that squeeze between the vent 
&quot;ribs&quot; . I looked for a pic on the web with no luck. So easy that they 
probably figured if you see it you'll make one.

I know that folks have come up with some great ideas with pieces of 
magnetic material for the same reason, I just wanted to throw this out 
there for you.
