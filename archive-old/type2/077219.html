Subject: Re: [T2] Engine-neering - combustion chamber question

The engine in my bus is actually a 914/412s engine 1800cc 85 horse power it 
is fitted with a paper air filter unit with a themostatic valve which opens 
to allow cooler air in from the front of the engine compartment. It is fitted 
with twin 40mm solex carbs and both  van and engine are european spec.
