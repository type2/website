The event was great. Babcia (69 westie) ran like a charm in the cool temps.
Only three or four 35 mph climbs on the very steep grades back up the
mountain. After hitting the top we drove about 5 miles to the first flea
market stop and found the engine to be quite cool!

I'll let someone else do a big report, but many listees were in attendance.
Lots of good fun. Lots of kids having a wonderful time. They played some
type of game in the stadium where dogs meant &quot;power&quot;, so no dog was safe
from their company. :-) Our new dog is exhausted.

I planned a naked fun run through the forest covered with stuff from a
broken open glow stick, but it was too cold and Chris Cybulski was calling
me funny names.

A report on the new Coleman propane catalytic heater: If you have no heater
boxes, don't leave home without it. No fumes. Kept the interior toasty at
night and bearable driving in 30somthing degree temps on the way home. I
bought it on the trip down at wall mart for $45.00.

I am going to redo the webpage and saw lots of cameras there. Please let me
know if you can send me some. Sean? Dave? Chad? Royce? Anyone else?
