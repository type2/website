Subject: rear brakes/frozen star adjuster

Folks

Thanks for the suggestions and help yesterday regarding how to remove frozen
star adjusters while doing the rear brakes. I took the new bolt I bought, a
10 mm hex bolt (same as an M8 ?) longer than the adjuster screw, threaded it
into the star adjuster and just kept cranking (17 mm wrench) until the
adjuster started to lift away from the bore. I kept cranking until it was
about 1/4 inch out, threaded the bolt back out, and tapped the adjuster out
with a hammer and screwdriver. Wunderbahr. I'm sure having sprayed it with
liquid wrench the night before helped.
