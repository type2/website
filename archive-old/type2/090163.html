&gt; &gt;Has anyone installed a hydraulic clutch in their Baywindow?

&gt; Hi Chris(and list)
&gt;
&gt; I've been wanting to do the same thing, but the only hydraulic setups I have
&gt; seen that are adaptable to the VW transmission(easily anyway) are sandrail
&gt; setups.  I too would like to know of anyone who has tackled this one.

It wouldn't be hard, with a custom bellcrank on the clutch pedal and a
dunebuggy master and slave cylinder.

My other question is... Why?

In 8 years I've had one clutch cable failure and I was back on the road in
an hour.  The only car I had with a hydraulic clutch blew both the master
and slave cylinder in the same time, each time a drive home without clutch
and a several hour rebuild and bleed experience.  No fun at all.

George
