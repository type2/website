&gt; This question has probably been answered a million times but... in my
&gt; bus i noticed under the front carpet (by the pedals/front seats) some
&gt; rust (mostly surface). I have been told by a few people to use a zinc
&gt; cro-mat on the rust. I stopped by and called places like Home Depot,
&gt; and several auto parts stores but no one seems to know what I am
&gt; talking about or cant help me with a product that would work. What I
&gt; should use on the rust? Where can I get it?

Start with something to remove the rust if it's light. I like Naval Jelly,
it works well but you must be certain to get it all off after you've
finished, preferably by washing the floor. Dry well.

Then put a &quot;self-etching, passivating primer&quot; on your rust. If you're going
to cover it with carpet and no one will see it, a good grade of primer
followed by a couple coats of tractor paint will work. Tractor paint is neat
stuff. It's sold to (ta da!) paint tractors; it claims to prevent rust,
comes in many agricultural-equipment colors which you don't care about since
you're going to put a carpet on it anyway, and costs $20 per gallon. Farm
supply stores have it.
