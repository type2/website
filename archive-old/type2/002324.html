HI Volks,

I've not been on this for more than a year, back now.

I figure since I drive a couple of '71s and have lots of parts to offer, I
might as well see what's up.


I did find a small NOS stash of loaf Westy parts.  I 'll dust them off and
list them soon.

Look for a '71 single cab, '71 Pop-top, or '71 Panel, might be me, just give
me the secret code peace sign and I'll know you are an INSIDER.
