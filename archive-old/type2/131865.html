Subject: My bus blows all over the road..............

When i get going 65 and up.. the slightest gusts of wind  really move me
around.  I recently put on ball joints, and the tie rods seem
fine..........it was aligned, too.  But, it drives the same after as before
all that work was done. New tires, too.


Any ideas?
