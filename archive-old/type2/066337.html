Subject: Re: What are &quot;Deadhead stickers&quot;?

Jean Baptiste Le Pesant asks, 
&gt;&quot;What are &quot;Deadhead&quot; stickers&quot;?

and Chris Turner replies,
&gt;Well, Jean, here in the US we use these stickers called &quot;Deadhead&quot;
&gt;stickers as a scale indicator to how much a VW bus is trashed. (snip) 

&gt;Ok, folks , let me slip into my firesuit first.....
&gt;

Okay, my friend, are you armored yet?  :)

I'm certain that other than VW hobbyists, there is no single group of 
people in the U.S. among whom VW buses are more prevalent than Deadheads 
(followers of the Grateful Dead) and their brothers in kind (Phish-heads, 
etc.). In this respect, they have done a lot to keep many buses on the 
road, albeit sometimes just barely.  I've personally sold many a bus to a 
Deadhead, and indeed they (we) are a varied lot. Few buy a bus with the 
intention of trashing it, but on the other hand this is a population that 
uses their buses hard (often traveling thousands of miles at a time within 
a few weeks) and sometimes on a shoestring budget.  Among Deadheads, as 
with anyone else, it seems that the condition of the bus is in direct 
proportion to the individual owner's financial ability to keep it in good 
condition.  And when you're dealing with a group of people to whom 
affluence is not always a major concern, this financial ability is 
sometimes limited.   

Then again, if you consider the addition of bumper stickers, Guatemalan 
tapestries, tye-died curtains, and some threadbareness here and there 
analagous to &quot;trashing&quot; a bus, then perhaps you are right (or perhaps you 
merely aren't old enough to remember the 1960's).  To me, the point of 
owning a VW is to enjoy it to the fullest, no matter how that may be.  The 
person who considers his/her VW a museum piece, and insists that every inch 
be factory original and cleaned with a toothbrush, is enjoying it in his 
own way, which is good.  By the same token, the person who expends his own 
sweat, blood, and creative energy customizing his VW in a manner that suits 
his individual needs and personality is also enjoying it in his own way. 
This, after all, is supposed to be the &quot;People's Car&quot;, affordable to own 
and maintain by those of less than auspicious means, and sometimes the 
homemade adornments, besides costing less than N.O.S., give one's 
Volkswagen its own individual personality.  My wife and I personally enjoy 
our Westy to the fullest, and it has the war-wounds to prove it - stains on 
the carpet, scratches on the paint, etc. It still looks pretty good, and 
basically stock, at 145k.  It will probably have a whole lot more scars at 
245k.  But every scar represents a trip or experience that might not have 
happened without my Westy, and I wouldn't trade that in a million years for 
a mint-condition museum piece that I was afraid to drive.
