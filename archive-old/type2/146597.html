Subject: garage door height?

I'm in the final stages of planning a new garage, and I'm deciding on
garage door size. I'd like to get seven foot tall garage doors--
they're cheaper and I think they look nicer. But also, I'd like to
know that our bus (a '78 Westfalia) will fit through the opening. It
seems like it ought to fit, but I'd thought I'd inquire to be certain.
Has anyone had trouble getting a Westy through a seven foot high
garage door?

Thanks.

Rob Mead
