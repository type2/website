Subject: Give Show Locations

I have a suggestion for those posting announcements of upcoming events:

Give complete info regarding the location of the show!  Like what state it
is in!  The post from 7/24 listed something about a show in &quot;Denton&quot;.
Where is Denton?  I guess I could call the numbers posted, or I could dig
out an atlas and try to find Denton (where would I start?), but it would
seem easier just to read it in the announcement.

I've noticed this several times on other events posted on the list.

Tim
