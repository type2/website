Subject: RE: [T2] Why VW buses die

&gt; Off hand I'd guess that that's probably true of most=20
&gt; vehicles...I wonder
&gt; what the cut off point for most cars/vans is, BTW ?? At what=20
&gt; point does
&gt; the vehicle become a beater and stop getting real=20
&gt; service/care...? Is it
&gt; just mileage or the overall condition - dents, dings, etc. ?
&gt; Myself, I'm of the run it till it's used up group. Rust is my=20
&gt; biggest enemy;
&gt; how 'bout you?

It seems that my vehicles' demise usually start
when the air conditioner breaks.  Then the tranny
goes, then the oil consumption increases, etc. In the
case of my last American car, when it got to that
point, I traded it for my first type 2.  The vehicle
didn't stop getting real service, just became unenjoyable
to drive.
