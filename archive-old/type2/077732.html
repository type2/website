Subject: [T2] Gas fill elbows COOL FIND


&gt; Here is something wev'e been looking for for years and I stumbled
&gt; across the solution.  The '72-'79 uses that formed 45 degree angle
&gt; in the fill hose, NLA from the dealer and previous solutions have been
&gt; akward (straight reinforced or non-reinforced Gates hose etc.)
&gt;
&gt; So I was looking around a bunch of turbocharger sites as I just picked
&gt; up a blower (hmmn) and noticed that 45 elbows are available in 2 1/4&quot;
&gt; diameter in Buna-N or Silicone (both wonderful for the application) for
&gt; about $10 and $25 respectively.  I ordered a Buna-N one for the '77 to
&gt; keep things looking right.  I'll tell how it looks when I get it but I'm
sure
&gt; it will work fine, legs are about 3&quot; on each side.  Now I'm damn well
&gt; hoping I'm remembering it is 2 1/4&quot; as its been about 5 years since I've
&gt; replaced one but I'm pretty sure, like 55mm or so as I recall.
&gt;
&gt; Go out and get it folks, this is one about every Bus owner needs, even
&gt; if they look good on the outside that elbow is nearly always shot.  Search
&gt; for turbocharger on the www and you'll find a score of places selling the
&gt; stuff, pick one near you.
