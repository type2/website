Subject: Re: [T2] racing buses on dirt

In '96 I took Farthur (72 Westy) on it's maiden voyage 
to Laguna Seca Days music festival. For those not 
familiar, the venue was smack dab in the middle of 
Laguna Seca racetrack. While shooting the breeze with 
the fellow busser parked next to me I came up with the 
idea of racing busses as a between show diversion. Has 
anyone here ever seen the &quot;corkscrew&quot;? :-)

IMHO organized bus racing would be interesting, but I 
can't help thinkning that if it really caught on and 
went big time that it might have a negative effect on 
price and availability of parts. 

just my .02
