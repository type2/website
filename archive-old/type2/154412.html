Subject: RE: [T2] Removing hubcaps

&gt; I don't have a stock puller for the pairs of holes, but I 
&gt; would have thought that the old screwdriver in the joint
&gt; method would work.  Nothing.  That cap is stuck tight. 
&gt; And it looks like some PO has tried that, because the 
&gt; hub is scratched up there. 



Incidentally, a stock hubcap puller is just 85 cents... It pays for itself
ten times over the first time you avoid scratching your hubcap with a
screwdriver.
