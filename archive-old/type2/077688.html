Subject: Re: [T2] oil additive advice

&gt; be corrosive to your bearings.  Well I am wondering if anybody has run
&gt; either stuff for an extended perriod of time and could tell me just exactly
&gt; how corrosive it really is.  I was told that the active ingreedient is
&gt; LinKite and I was wondering if anybody knew of a product that contained
&gt; LinKite but wasn't corrosive.  I am starting to think that the best thing
&gt; would be to stick with normal oil and change it regularly, so if that is

Linkite? OK this sounds like a silly made up name like LastOLene or maybe
Wareno how about Permex...
