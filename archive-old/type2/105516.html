Subject: Re: [T2] Bottom charcoal canister hose

plugs into the hole on the lower right side of the engine tin, slightly back 
from where the fan housing ends. The original nipple it use to attach to is 
'prolly gone. Easy enough to fab a new one, or just open up the hole in the 
tin slightly, put in a grommet, and insert hose into that.
