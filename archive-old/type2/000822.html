Cool idea. I Kinda like Scott Bogen's suggestion that maybe we canvas the
country state by state passing or at least having it meet each memeber that
desired a part in it. And having the 'Baton' get to the other coast maybe
meeting for a short time in Oklahoma - This would be a challenge to try to
determine how many list memebers would be involved and estimated completion
time, worked out to getting the Baton at the desired locations
simultaneously. Speed maybe shouldn't be as much an emphasis as estimated
completion time by the individual traveling the leg and the seeing how close
they come or something like that. Don't they do something like that in some
form of the rally's???
