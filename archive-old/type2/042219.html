Hello All,

Just returned from a little voyage from Clarksville TN to Fort Walton Beach
FL.  Everything was going well until I got about 15 miles from Fort Walton
Beach.  At that point in time (which was about 3:00 AM), the little noise
coming from the rear of the bus got really loud and then went completely
silent.  The bus floated across the road a few times before I managed to get
her to slide to a stop on the shoulder.  When I got out to see what
happened, I found that the driver's side rear wheel had come completely off
the vehicle.  The axle was shredded, cv joint sheared apart, breaks torn to
pieces, tire blown out, and the back of the bus was resting with the shocks
on the ground.

My wife, a friend, two dogs, all of our luggage for the 4-day weekend, and
myself were now stuck on the side of the road.  Nobody we knew was home, all
of the garages and tow trucks we called we're still closed and no cab would
come and pick all of us up (would only pick up to two people and they we're
willing to do it for the money I had).  And then, the cell phone started
dying.  So, we set out reflectors, popped the top, and went to sleep
thinking daylight would bring better news.  Around 6:30 AM we were still
unable to get in touch with anybody (I spliced the cell-phone power pack
into the bus - ok, so the wife forgot to bring the cigarette lighter
adaptor, but wasn't going to make an issue of it right there - You know).
Finally, just before 7:00 AM, I turned to the last resort and called AIRS
volunteer Victor Cardona (HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR MR. CARDONA).  Victor
was great.  He came right over and picked us all up, drove us all the way
into Fort Walton Beach over to my wife's friend's house, and even
recommended a great mechanic.  Thank you so much Victor.

So, we were finally able to get the bus towed to Little Motors off of
Highway 98 near Hulbert Field owned and operated by Jeff (Huge plug for
him - I'll get all the specific data later when I get my other bag back -
another story).  Jeff was closed for 4th of July, but came in on Monday the
3rd since he knew we were from out of town and had to get back to work, took
an axle from another bus and had our Bess running and ready to go by late
Monday afternoon.  Also, he got us another tire because he wouldn't let us
leave without having a spare.  So, he got another axle, fixed the breaks,
new tire, and all put it all together in perfect working order on his day
off for people from out of town and charged us less than $100 (We were
already trying to figure out which one of my organs we were going to have to
sell to pay for this).  What a guy!!!  Seriously, he did a great job and
helped us out of a very tough spot.

Thank you so much Mr. Cardona and Jeff from Little Motors.  You guys are
what makes owning a VW so special.  Also, having the weekend that we did
(very tough), it was great to see what great people are still out there.
Great for the soul!

Thank You so much,
