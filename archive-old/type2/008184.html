Subject: fuel pump on an 82 westy
Date: Sat, 26 Dec 1998 07:52:28 -0600

Howdy!

This is my first posting to the list so please forgive any rule breaking! 
My fuel pump on my 82 Westy is making a loud buzzing noise.  I'm going to
replace the fuel filter in the hopes that the pump is just starved for fuel
(it seems to run o.k.).  My question is this:

I have a generic electric pump that gets installed on an 81 F-150 when the
mechanical pump fails (an all too common occurance!).  Can this be used on
my Vanagon in an emergency?  I have to make a 4 hour trip today and since I
live in the boonies, there are no FLAPS that carry VW parts.  

Quick replies will be appreciated.
