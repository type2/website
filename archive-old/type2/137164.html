Subject: air hoses (vacuum hoses) answer

I had no useful responses, also none from the Dutch language 
sister list (luchtlist). The hose I am referring to is not the one that 
goes to the distributor to advance or retard the spark, but thanks 
for trying to all those who suggested something along those lines. 

However I crawled all over the motor today with a mirror and torch, 
and found somewhere to connect the loose tube.

The problem:
&gt; On top of the air filter there is a wide plastic moulding that
&gt; takes the clean air left and right to the top of the two carbs. On
&gt; the underside of this &quot;air bridge&quot; there is a bump the size and
&gt; shape of a matchbox, with two nipples, to which two small
&gt; hoses about 1.5 mm internal diameter are connected. The shorter
&gt; hose goes down to the air intake directly below, the longer one
&gt; swings around in the motor space. I'm sure that's not right, but I
&gt; can't see anywhere to connect it. 

The solution:
Under each carburettor is a vertical pipe taking the air/fuel mix 
down to the cylinders, and these two vertical pipes are cross-
connected with a 10cm diameter metal pipe that passes under the 
bracket the air filter is mounted on. Right in the middle where it can 
only be seen with a mirror and torch there is a T-junction, with a 
connector of the right diameter and in the right position (given the 
length of the swinging tube). So there it goes, for now. Only the * 
thing still won't start ...
