Subject: Re: [VB] Need Help with Crankcase Ventilation Setup

That configuration is screwed up. You don't have any crankcase
ventilation like that. I'll bet the back of the engine has oil all over
it.

Here's how to fix it. Take the box off the fan housing. Take the
fittings out of the box. Throw the box away. Drill a hole in the top of
one of the air cleaner on the right side big enough to install the
fitting you saved from the box and install it. Run a hose from beside
the oil filler to the fitting on top of the air cleaner. Plug the hole
where the fuel pump used to be. Clean up the back of the engine.

A hose clamp on the connection on the carb is a good idea, just to be
sure the fitting doesn't vibrate loose and fall into the carb. If there
are holes in the fan housing, those need to be plugged too.

The point is: you need air flow from the crankcase to the air cleaner
for the ventilation system to work right. You don't have that with the
present setup.

Hope that helps.

&gt; The engine is not stock.  It is a single port with dual carbs and big bore
&gt; cylinders.  It has an electric fuel pump.  The opening for the mechanical
&gt; fuel pump has a metal cap with a hose that goes to a small box attached to
&gt; the fan housing.  There is also a hose that goes from the oil filler cap
&gt; area to the box.  This is the hose that would normally go to the air cleaner
&gt; on a stock configuration.  The box also has a third tap that is plugged.
&gt; 
&gt; None of this seems to make any sense to me.  Both crankcase vents (the one
&gt; from the plate covering the opening for the mechanical fuel pump and the one
&gt; near the oil filler cap) go the box attached to the fan housing but the
&gt; outlet from the box is plugged.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:  Is this configuration ok?  Shouldn't the outlet go an air
&gt; filter?  The air filters are these short towers made from folded paper.  If
&gt; this isn't right, what should I do?
