Subject: 2.0L ?

Hello....again!
Its been a while since I've been on this list, and a good bit has changed
since then.  But, I'll get right to the point.  I'm looking for a 2.0L type4
engine in good running condition.  I'm not looking for something that I've
to rebuild.  I don't need most of the tin, fan housing, and a few other
parts as I'm looking to convert it to an upright engine to stuff into my 61
westy.  I'll be running dual carbs, so I don't need any of the fuel
infection.  I'm in Wisconsin, so shipping will probably be the way to get it
to me, but pickup is possible depending on your location.

Have something for me?  Please p-mail me with specifics.  Thanks!!

Isaiah
-61 Flip Seat Westy

ps - For those of you who knew me before.... Stella (the 71 I started out
with) left me last night.  She now resides in Michigan with her new owner.
She went to a good home.  I'll miss her.
