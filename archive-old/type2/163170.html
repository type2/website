Subject: Re: [T2] This guy should be horse whipped......

There are a couple of problems, James.

One is that the engine has never been run. So does it run? What is its 
condition? This is a pig in a poke if there ever was one.

Second is that the reserve is clearly too high. This is, from the looks 
of it, at most a $2500 bus, more in the $1500 to $2000 range (with 
$3000 work to be done).

Third, the paint doesn't look so good, and the choices of paint (on the 
wheels, for instance, and on the engine fan shroud), show a lack of 
interest in details.

I'm sure that Karl can add more.
