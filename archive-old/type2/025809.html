the bus boys plate replaces the inspection plate. i have one, all it is is
an
inspection plate with a hole drilled in it, nothing special , just drill a
hole
in your own or pull an extra from a junker, i liked having a nice shiny new
one
though with the hole in the correct spot, it is a constant source of oil
leakage though, i haven't been able to figure out how to make it tight


I have a plate from a porche that has the correct hole too and it was a
source of leaking as well, until I used teflon tape (plumbing tape) and used
that - now all is well for at least a couple of oil changes.
