Subject: Re: [T2] gas tanks

After many informative posts on this topic, John Anderson nails it for me:

&quot;And another thing to this entire thread, no way, no how, you will clean a tank as well as getting it done at the local radiator shop.  My local radiator shop wants $40, calculate very closely your time, money in chemicals, and effort, let alone the friggin hassle of it.  They want about another $50 to coat afterwards, and I'd be inclined to let them do that as well.&quot;

If people are really doing it for 40$ still, it's the obvious way to go. Thanks to all, I'm now in the know.

Hey, if you check out Mike Howles' Spooky site, his tank is powder coated a nice shiny red. Would a powder coater's dip tank clean my gastank out as well as the radiator guy?
