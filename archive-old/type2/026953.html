Hello...
I know a lot of you strongly suggest to use strictly Bosche.  How &quot;bad&quot; is 
it to use another brand coil?  I have access to pretty much everything BUT 
Bosche unless I want to wait 7-10 days...is it worth giving up a weekend in 
my green beauty to wait for the proper coil?

Thanks,
Chet Needham
