&gt;This, after all, is supposed to be the &quot;People's Car&quot;, affordable to own 
&gt;and maintain by those of less than auspicious means, and sometimes the 
&gt;homemade adornments, besides costing less than N.O.S., give one's 
&gt;Volkswagen its own individual personality.  
&gt;
&gt;So I wrote:
&gt;Amen, brother Salmon!
&gt;
&gt;I have often been impressed with the extent to which VW buses seem to
&gt;exceed any other vehicle (in the US and Canada anyway) in quaint, often
&gt;bizarre, sometimes very beautiful folk decoration.
&gt; 
&gt;I went to the Rainbow Gathering last year and was inspired to undertake a
&gt;new project of photojournalism to document the phenomenon of the &quot;Hippie
&gt;VW Bus.&quot; I saw some of the most incredibly customized, one up, lovingly
decorated
&gt;vehicles there. The tradition, I'm sure, derives itself partly from
&quot;FURTHUR (sic)&quot;
&gt;the famous acid  bus of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. But it also
&gt;derives itself from the VW traditions of the People's Car. 
&gt;
&gt;The tradition of doing immaculate, sanitary, meticulously detail oriented 
&gt;vehicle restoration is also a grand one. Problem is, the logical conclusion of
&gt;that path is a vehicle that is far too valuable and primo to subject to the
&gt;slings and darts of outrageous fortune on the streets and actually DRIVE
anywhere.
&gt;Much less go CAMPING in one. I assert that if you really want to continue
&gt;using your bus, you can't do an all out restoration. In my own case, I have 
&gt;striven for a middle ground, staying stock as a general rule of thumb (for 
&gt;example, when painting), except when it makes sense not to do so (i.e. extra 
&gt;temperature gauges, electronic ignition, supplemental oil cooler, modern
materials
&gt;in valves for unleaded gas, etc.). 
&gt;
&gt;I haven't gotten too far with my photo project yet, but I aspire to collect
lots
&gt;of high quality photographs of lovingly decorated VW buses. I admire the sano
&gt;resto jobs, but I think the lovingly decorated hippie-style buses (and their
&gt;post-modern ilk, i.e. Scott's Doodle Bus) are much more interesting and 
&gt;arguably more valuable as expressions of a rich and diverse human culture.
&gt;
&gt;Remember how John Muir said to buy  a bus? Something like, lie down in the back
&gt;and ask yourself- have happy people been living and driving and balling in
here?
&gt;With a good hippie bus, there's no doubt: These buses are loved! I wish more
&gt;Deadheads knew how to changer their oil regularly though...
&gt;
&gt;Party on,
&gt;Surfer Bob

The Vast Majority of Bus owners learn quickly.  The owners shortly find
that the VW engine is very &quot;forgiving&quot; - up to a point.  Changing oil,
since it's only 2.7 quarts, and adjusting valves, are the biggies.

Almost all &quot;hippies&quot; (including myself) know more about their busses than
ANYONE else, including mechanics.  The symbiotic relationship with one's
VW that seems to naturally arise, is a direct correlation to how someone
cares about his life, friends, etc.  In short, good people that take care
of their VW's, are usually people that take good care of their portion 
of reality and friends.

The above rule does NOT apply to those that try to have major power trips
about racing - power cores - BEATING someone (why bother, we've already gone
to the moon at 25,000 mph, why worry about 176 mph?)  - and the REAL deal,
more and more, is to live our lives in some harmony with our environment.
In fact, it could be looked at like:  If you can't handle a REAL car, like
a VW bus, then you will be stuck dealing with big hogs that you'll always
worry (like penis size) won't quite &quot;measure up&quot; to your friends.

This &quot;sickness&quot; of over-consumption, seems to be still happening, even
though everyone that gets a bigger/badder car with a bigger &quot;thump&quot;
stereo system, eventually figures it out - &quot;Hey, why I'm I still un-
statisfied and unhappy ?&quot;  At least most figure it out, eventually.
