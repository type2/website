Subject: Burned wires

My main email acocunt isn't working properly at the moment so I signed up
with my gmail account.

I drove my bus a fair distance today to stretch its legs and get more of a
feel for her.  She ran great, no heat problems, no power problems,
everything was great.   When I got to my destination she died when I came to
a stop.  So just making sure everything was okay (I had just finished
replacing the alternator and voltage regulator) I started her up again real
quick.   She started but I noticed LOTS of smoke pouring out of the intake
vent on the left.  Fearing the worst I shut down and ran to the back to take
stock of the situation.  It wasn't burning oil or gas so that was a good
thing, but then I noticed one of the wires inside was definately melted.

I don't have a picture yet because my website is down grrrrrr  this has been
happening nightly.  But it looks like a heavy gauge wire that runs from the
large gauge wire that connects to the positive batter lead and runs to the
starter.  I tried searching the list but don't really know what I am looking
for.

The burnt wire in question is about a 14 ga braided wire and runs through
the firewall near where the starter is.

Any Ideas?

oh yeah, the idiot light was a connection problem.  All fixed now.
