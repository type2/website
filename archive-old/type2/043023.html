Subject: Dipstick and update

Hey all!
Dipstick first...

Still haven't found a dipstick for my 72 Westy.  Right now I have the one
from my 912 in there just to plug the hole.  Can some kind person do me a
huge favor and pull theirs and measure it for me.  I have plenty of extra
914 ones (way too long) and am happy cutting off mine and marking it off for
the correct fill lines.  Obviously, measure from the handle towards the oily
end.

here would be a pic of it

Overall length =&quot;A&quot;
End to Top fill Line = &quot;B&quot;
Those two numbers are all I need

                                              {{    ___  }}
                                                 {{_____}}

And speaking of Really, Really Kind people-  Major Kudos' to Nikki Elko.
I was in search of an air cleaner for the 72 and she sent me one she had
from a 73 to try and make fit.  Still trying to make it work, but wow what a
nice person!!!

As for the general running, I have a problem with the motor that seems to
get worse as it gets hotter (the engine).  The throttle response gets to the
point where it almost feels like there is not enough gas getting to the
carbs.  I'll be in 3rd gear, level road, and it doesn't want to get up and
zoom.  I can back off the throttle a tad and it feels like it wants to
accelerate slightly.  All stock, new points, condenser, cap, wires, rotor,
(all electrical parts), new fuel filters, synched carbs, new choke elements,
etc.  Cold running is better, (going to go try it out right now)

Any ideas on what to look at next?


Thanks!
