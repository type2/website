Subject: Re: [T2] Thousands of FREE parts in Baltimore

Volks

A long time (20+ years) bus mechanic has folded up his tent and moved out
of town,  he has given me free access to whats' left in the garage (Very
big garage, 8 vans at least) but he has called the scrappers. 

first come, first serve
Haul it away and it is yours.
thousands of parts including but not limited to

.  at least 15 engines in various stages of repair, from complete engines
to case halfs
.  at least 20 trannys, condition ???
.  at least 50 heads
.  just about every body part imaginable
.  glass
.  intake manifolds, all types
.  carbs, hundreds
.  alt/gen
.  half shafts, and suspension components
.  two roofs, one complete from belt rail up
.  metal for welding, rods/sheet/angles/shapes  TONS of it

Whats pretty much gone
. heater boxes
. FI parts, although I grabbed at least a dozen ECU's
. Westy stuff
. scrapper has already gotten most of the flywheels and clutches, but
there are a few left.
. mostly bay window stuff but things for beetles, porsche, Mercedes, type3
and type 4 are there, I've seen em
. didn't see any reduction boxes, but that doesn't mean there aren't any

this stuff is in central Baltimore city, near the inner harbor.
I cannot and will not pull stuff, probably couldn't find it
I have to be there for access. when you contact me for access I will give
you directions.  I've already hauled out 3 vans full of &quot;stuff&quot; and
haven't made a dent.  I don't have any more room in my one car garage.

SAVE THIS TREASURE TROVE FROM THE SCRAPPER, most everything is pulled and
shelved, heck most of it is even clean.  Heck there are two safes there
for the hauling, used for paint storage.


Bob
you can call my office at 410-327-6119 but I can't and won't pull stuff
and honestly I doubt if I know whats left, everytime I look I find
something new.  I bought my bus from this guy, and when I'm stumped I
usually took it to him, we have lost a &quot;Real&quot; mechanic.
