Subject: RE: [T2] Pop top order fiasco

Sorry to rehash this again, hopefully anything else will be handled off
list... but I just wanted to make sure that I was clear to the list members
in the fact that I am usually very happy with the Bus Depot's service,
supply and quality of merchandise (as I have said in the past.)  The intent
of my original post to the list was to find an alternate supplier for the
merchandise I was having difficulty getting, not to bash the Bus Depot.  As
I said in that post, I am disappointed in the way &quot;THIS&quot; transaction was
handled.  For the record, I have been quite satisfied in the overall quality
of service from the Bus Depot.
