Subject: correct hypoid oil

Hello,

I am trying ro find the correct gear oil for the final drive for a 73 bus 
with automatic transmission.  The manual lists SAE 90.  All I can find are 
multi-viscosity like 80W90.  IS it ok to use these?  Does anyone have a 
specific brand to recommend.  Can anyone give me a specific of exactly what 
to buy?  Thanks kindly for the help.
