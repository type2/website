Subject: Water Tank

Hello,
    I have recently received help with wiring up my
sink from this list and it worked!  Thanks a lot guys.
 Now that I got the sink to work, I found out that the
tank leaks where the pump and drainage regulator screw
in.  I don't want to patch it up fearing that water
will eventually leak out, so I'm either looking for
one that's not like that....or, does anyone know where
to buy a new one.  Just as long as it fits, it doesn't
mater if it has the same capacity or not.  I'd prefer
a new one.  I have a 77 westfalia.  Thanks a lot.

Tim
