&gt; one remaining hurdle though, and that is a big bad battery drain. something
&gt; in the charging system is foul. overnight the battery dies. been through
&gt; the dash looking, but everything there seems perfect according to bentley's
&gt; wiring diagram. red gen light is on only while driving - at all revs.
&gt; question: what is the life span of a regulator? local repairman - not a
&gt; guru - suggested they go in about 10 years. i'm up in the air, and look to
&gt; your advise.  - steve
Steve are you sure it's a battery drain or a non  charging generator?
I've found that the regulator has been replaced with a bug one instead
of a 38 amp bus one and that shortened its life.
Another culprit is the generator brushes. Since generators use
commutators instead of slip ring like alternators, brushes do not last
as long. I've never had a long running type 1 motor, but I'd guess in
the 30k to 50k mile range is the life of generator brushes.
