Subject: Electrolytic Rust Removal Questions

     So I read about the Electrolytic Rust Removal process and I'm very 
interested in it.  I just had a couple of questions for anyone out there 
that might be able to answer them:

1) What about items where rust may be enclosed in a cavity, such as a 
muffler or exhaust manifold?  Can I still use this process on them?  Since 
the resultant metal is prone to rusting quickly I am worried that if there 
is rust inside the manifold or muffler that I want to treat, it will get 
cleaned up by the electrolytic process and then only rust worse later from 
the inside out?  Is this just not a good method to clean and de-rust 
enclosed items like that?

2) What about painted items?  I am afriad that some metal on my vehicles has 
been painted right over wire-brushed surface rust.   Will the paint keep 
this process from working on that rust, or will it simply lift the paint off 
with the rust.

I read one web page on this process that had pictures of someone treating an 
entire truck frame.  It's inspiring.  I wonder if I could make a dunk tank 
big enough for a bus.  My neighbors would just love it.
