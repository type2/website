Subject: 2.0 L engine needed in Washington, DC area

A friend just got her first bus. Bus has a blown engine and she is really bummed out. Anybody got a 2.0 L laying around they can let go of? Would be doubly cool if they had a FI system to go with it. Need soon - before the end of camping season.
Thanks in advance,
Maui Haui
