That's the earliest bay window number I've ever seen! 229 from the beginning of
68! Cool!
Registration is purely a function of the county treasurer in our state.
My 60 Corvette is titled as a 61. (There are significant differences between the
two years, and the numbers are correct. It IS just about the last 60 built. )
MIGHT have been a little collusion between the selling dealer and the county
treasurer back then. A year newer on the registration would have increased the
loan value by a thousand dollars or so.
Back before the days of centralized computers, $100 in the right hands could
have given you papers that said it was a 69 Rolls Royce!

&gt; A Bus chassis number is registered as '69, but the VIN is 228 100 229. Can a
&gt; bus be built in '68 and have the vin of a '68, but be registered as a '69?
