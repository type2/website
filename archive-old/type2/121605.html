Subject: Re: [T2] isolators and regulator info - Thanks Guys!

Forgive me, but why does everyone seem to want to do this the 
hard/expensive/dangerous way?

The high-power relay is about $12.  It's safer than a knife switch and 
easier to use.  It is foolproof.  It is convenient.  It is the best tool 
for the job any way you look at it.  I don't understand why people continue 
to pay good money for isolators, undersized relays, undersized wire, manual 
A-B switches and other sub-optimal solutions.

This page has some good basic info:

Here is a fancy version of the relay I have.  This one is $40 though:

I can't find a link to the one I bought, but I got it from Camping 
World.  That and the louverd window crank handles are about the only things 
I have ever bought there.
