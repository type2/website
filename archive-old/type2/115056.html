&gt;&gt; Does anyone know where I can find a battery terminal like this. It's the
&gt;&gt; original kind with the male spade connector for the aux. battery relay wire.

&gt; AMP is HUGE in the terminal business.

tim, richard,

i am in the process of setting up an account to buy AMP terminals. i cannot
get them straight from AMP, but i have to go through a distributor. the
reason for getting the parts is so we can offer rebuild parts for the
harnesses of busses, especially the engine FI harness.

i am not sure if they still make this one, but i will try to find out.
