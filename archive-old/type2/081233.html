&gt;
&gt; Well, the fun and games are over.  For now anyways.  Being that this was
&gt; my first EveryBus, I promised myself that I would take pictures to
&gt; remember the event.  I was not disappointed.  My engine, as a lot of
&gt; people already knew, was running pretty bad.  Friday morning I managed
&gt; to limp to Linville, NC on three cylinders to meet up with Doc Ric and
&gt; everyone from the Roan Mt. carabus. Ric and others took a look and we
&gt; ended up fixing the problem by just swapping the injectors on cylinders
&gt; 1 and 2.  What gives??  So we head to Greensboro and the bus runs fine,
&gt; although Ric's had a heating problem that would continue through the
&gt; trip home.  I got to EB with the intention of still dropping my engine
&gt; to replace the rear main seal and some other stuff.  However, after some
&gt; thinking through, I decided that I would hold off because I do not have
&gt; enough money to buy more parts if we ran into other problems.  I do
&gt; thanks all those that volunteered to help me.  Now, with Steve Dolan's
&gt; expert advice that I still had a vacuum leak  (eeerrrrrrrrrrr!!!!), I
&gt; set out shortly to replace my injector seals with ones that were given
&gt; to me by Mike (to the man that gave them to me, correct me if I got your
&gt; name wrong).  Will also be replacing the fuel lines in that area with
&gt; some that Mr. Dolan gave me.  I am sort of annoyed at myself because out
&gt; of all the tools floating around there, including the ones that Jason
&gt; had right next to me, I never did get my compression checked.  LOL  I
&gt; will stop running off now and just let you know that all the pics I took
&gt; can be viewed at www.wicals_dot_com &lt;http://www.wicals_dot_com/&gt;  .   One last
&gt; thanks to Doc Ric, Steve Dolan, Jason LASTER, Mad Uncle Dave, all those
&gt; from the Roan Mt. carabus, Mike-for the injector seals, Mike Benthin,
&gt; and everyone else that helped me out while I was there.  For our first
&gt; trip, my family was very impressed and happy to meet all those that we
&gt; have been talking to on the list.  We look forward to all the other
&gt; events and will do what we can to make those as well.  Thanks everyone,
&gt; and happy busing.
