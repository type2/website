Berg does NOT recommend a 30mm pump on dual relief engines, he recommends
the 25 for single relief, and the 26mm for dual relief. 30mm is for race
applications ONLY. I recommend a 30mm type 1 pump (blueprinted) for type 4
engines though.

&gt; &gt; The pump is of a high-volume design.  Will this cause problems since a
&gt; &gt; single relief case cannot limit the maximum oil pressure seen by the
&gt; &gt; bearings?
&gt;
&gt; The valve in the 1500 is called the oil pressure relief valve.  It
performs two
&gt; functions.  When the oil is cold and thick, it forces the plunger down and
&gt; exposes two ports, one to the main galley and one to the sump.  As the oil
&gt; warms and thins, the piston is forced, by the spring,  past the port to
the
&gt; sump and oil flows through both the cooler and main galley.  In a hot
engine,
&gt; the plunger rises above the main galley port and flows all of the oil
through
&gt; the cooler and then to the cooler.
&gt;
&gt; Oil, like water, is not very compressible.  A higher volume forced through
the
&gt; same size passages should create a higher pressure.  This higher pressure
will
&gt; hold the plunger open to the sump port and the main galley port for a
longer
&gt; period of time and at higher oil temperature/lower viscosity.  Your oil
will be
&gt; hotter before it flows through the oil cooler.  This should raise the oil
&gt; temperature, and operating temperature of your lubrication system, crank,
&gt; bearings, rods.  Gene Berg recommended using the stock 26 MM pump in a
single
&gt; relief case.  (and a 30 MM pump in the dual relief case.)  Based upon his
&gt; explanation in his book of technical articles, I'd go with it.
&gt;
&gt; In your position, I'd install a new stock 26 MM oil pump.
