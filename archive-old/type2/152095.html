&gt;
&gt; Is this 45 min on the hwy,, or around town stop and go.. ?
&gt;
&gt; assuming it may be a stock dual carb engine... in my case #1....I found the fuel
&gt; pressure would drop off ... it seemed to run fine on the top half of the tank...
&gt;
&gt; In my Case #2  ,, I found a hose that was collapsing flat after time on the
&gt; highway... the pressure gauge indicated no pressure,, but every time I opened
&gt; the fuel system , that hose would return to normal..... it took some real
&gt; detective work to understand what the problems was NOT.. and come to the
&gt; conclusion it had to be that hose !

I had a beetle years ago that had a similar problem and it drove me nuts,
took several months but it turned out to be a tiny leak in the vacuum side
of the fuel line, when cold it was tight and didn't leak but as the engine
and the fuel line warmed a bit it softened up just enough for the fuel
pump to suck air. and it would just stop


my suggestion might be to replace all your fuel lines, you should do this
anyway and this will do double duty
