Subject: Oil fouled Cyl #1

Poor OBBy (our 73 Semi-Westy) just started running on only 3 cylinders!  I
pulled the plugs to find #1 really oily.  I have just pulled the engine to
find the previous owner had installed 1800 cylinders on rebuilt heads (about
20K ago)... LH cyl head had a 'spun' intake valve guide in #1 bore, and both
sides had cracks near the spark plug holes - a real no-no, so it's off the
to the local head rebuilder for some newer alum can head castings.  I pulled
the other head off to find it also has a small crack on one plug holes, so
have replaced it also...

The big question is how did all the oil get into #1 ?...the valve guides
don't look bad at all - but maybe that's where it got sucked in...anyone
have experience on this one?

Also, here in the 'Warm California Sun' the local Bus guy says to remove
both air flaps that are controlled by the bellows...we have very little
freezing weather down here in the low lands, and removing the 'flaps' should
allow for improved cooling thru the oil cooler - right...?

I am also going to S*** Can the covers and ducts around the heater boxes, as
well as plugging the blower outlets to same, and the electric blower
ducts...here hoping this increased air flow will help keep some of the
cracks out of the 'new' heads...

At least OBBy made another loop from Northern Calif down to Mulege in Baja
California (Mexico) last month without any problems...about 2,300 miles
total...we made the trip down (1100 miles) in 23 hours straight...poor OBBy
only got to stop every 200 miles or so for fuel, and a couple of fuel stops
for us - only minor problem was a couple of blown muffler flange gaskets - I
had installed a new single header/glasspack exhaust to replace the stock
muffler, and I out smarted myself by using SS bolts/nuts with SS lock
washers - bad choice, as the SS bolts expanded with the heat and the
lockwashers couldn't take it either, and lost their 'grip' allowing the
gaskets to blow out...I got some real asbestos sheet down in Mexico and made
some new gaskets, and replaced the bolts with regular old cad plated steel
to fix that problem...live and learn!...Also, my new 3/4 inch fwd and rear
sway bars were great on the twisty Baja Hwy 1, a real good investment - the
ride was a little bit rougher over dirt 'washboard' type roads down there,
however.
