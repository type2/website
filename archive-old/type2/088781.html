Subject: Re: [T2] how to find vac leak?


&gt; Do we agree that vac should be 17&quot; (not 12) AT IDLE?  I can only hit 17-20
if I rev the engine.
Any hints appreciated!

What is your timing set at? [at idle]
Retarded timing will give low vacuum.
Also cam timing affects vacuum.
Remove the left valve cover. Rotate the engine IN the direction of rotation
and watch #3 valves. You will see the exhaust open then close. Immediately,
you will see the intake open. Stop and turn the engine back until the exhaust
opens [or keep turning two revs]. Go in the direction again and JUST as the
exhaust closes and the intake JUST starts to move, STOP. Look at your timing
mark. It should on zero. If not, your cam timing is off.....

&gt; Also, where would I find new vac hose sized right for the aux-air-regulator
to &quot;S&quot; intake.  Mine has had the ends trimmed for the last time as it is
getting short.

I believe I have a decent used one you can have.
