Subject: Re: [T2] replacing brake booster, how hard??

&gt;I am wondering how hard it is to replace my brake booster. I've heard it 
&gt;can be hell getting them off. Hoping to hear from some people that have 
&gt;done it so i can decide if this is something that I can tackle myself or 
&gt;if i should have my mechanic do it. I'm fairly mechanical and have dropped 
&gt;my engine twice.

Hello from Cooke-vegas just up the road. &lt;grin&gt;

If you've got the Bentley manual and basic tools and the ability and 
experience to bleed the brake system when done it's not bad at all.
