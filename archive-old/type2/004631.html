Recently found a '71 westy for sale in my neck of the woods( Northern
Michigan)

Body: metal excellent, needs new paint: faded, repainted, Garaged, ugly
painted top, needs pop-top seal

Motor: 1776 , 2bbl, oil cooler and filter,009, Sounds good on quick check.
good end play

Interior: Good with added propane heater(install needs cleanup), Ignition
switch kluge
More details for those interested...

The guy is asking $6000.  I don't know the real value as my tastes are
Vanagons, but it looks like a nice piece with a little clean-up.
