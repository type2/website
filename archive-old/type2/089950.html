Subject: RE: [T2] VW Type 1 List

It's pretty quiet these days, some of the more opinionated
folks have moved on, so bickering hasn't been a problem, but
it does exist occasionally. You can pmail, you just
have to take the extra step of copying and pasting
the recipient's address.  Not much hassle compared to the
things we run into when working on our VWs. =3D20

IMHO, the occasional bickering is worth the wealth of knowledge
that is present.

&gt; I used to be on that list....full of bickering.........and=20
&gt; the worst is, you

&gt; There is already an email list for Beetles that's been around
&gt; for years.  Send an email to listproc_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu with
&gt; SUBSCRIBE VINTAGVW in the body.  While not specifically type I,
&gt; it seems that it's mostly Beetle discussions, and there's some
&gt; VERY knowledgable people on the list.  There's a guy on there
&gt; named Marc Vellat that seems to know as much as humanly possible
&gt; about VWs.  Also, for the past few years, there's been a guy
&gt; giving us weekly updates on his efforts to restore a Heb, very
&gt; interesting and sometimes funny accounts (and some not-so-funny)
&gt; of his trials and tribulations with his hired help.

&gt; &gt; Again, I apologize for marginal content, but I LOVE the T2
&gt; &gt; and VB lists so
&gt; &gt; much and have learned so much here, that I want to re-create
&gt; &gt; this atmosphere
&gt; &gt; in a Beetle setting and with beetle information. I sent out a
