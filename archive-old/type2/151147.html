Hi again, Dan,

&amp;gt; Good i have a set of 2 ton jack stands.  i just get a little
&amp;gt; scared working under the bus with them.  nothing i have every
&amp;gt; taken off under there has come off easily.  it always requires
&amp;gt; pulling and hammeringg and that freaks me out a little. anyway
&amp;gt; i'll go with the jack stands this time. i can just jack up the
&amp;gt; side i'm working on and leave the other on the ground?

I use really good 4-ton jacks because they have a wide four-
corner base and they are very stable.  Just block the front 
wheels, front and back, and lift both sides of the bus.  It is 
more stable (I believe) when it is lifted level (side to side). 
It is also much easier to work under there and to use leverage 
(the CJ joint bolts only require 25lbs during installation).  
Mine were over torqued by the PO so I had to use a breaker bar 
to get a couple of the bolts loose.  Good luck.

Jeff
