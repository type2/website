&gt;Could someone please tell me how to do a front end alignment on my 77 bus? I
&gt;can't afford a muir manual right now and one of my tires is about to burst
&gt;because i have to much toe in. I'm traveling from wisconsin to colorado next
&gt;week and could really use the info.

First of all, Muir is not really a manual, it's a novel.  If you want a 
manual, get Bentley.  $29 I think for your year, and you should never be 
without it, especially on a long trip.  Second, you can probably find an 
alignment for $30 if you look around.  Better than paying for a tow truck 
in the middle of nowhere when your tire blows from abnormal wear.  You're 
going to spend at least $60 in gas for the trip, another $60 would be well 
spent on the manual and alignment.  If you can't, consider getting to 
Colorado some other way and spend the gas money on the Bentley and the 
alignment.

If you must do it yourself, you can make an alignment tool from some scrap 
metal.  You'll need two pieces of stiff metal stock (square works best) 
about three feet long.  You want to attach them to the front wheels (not 
tires), parallel to the ground so that they are as close as possible to the 
center of the wheel while still clearing the body of the bus.  You will 
have to space them out from the rim to clear the tires - be sure and space 
them equally with small pieces of the aforementioned square tube.  You can 
use bungey cords to hold the assemblies on.  Using a tape measure, record 
the distance between the bars in front of the wheel and compare that to the 
distance between the bars behind the wheel.  Adjust the tie rod ends to 
bring them close to equal.

&gt;also, my oil sensor snapped off, is it ok to use an easy out to get it out?

I wouldn't.  If you can't get it out, you might be left in a state where 
there is no way to plug the hole, and then you won't be able to drive 
it.  It's pipe thread so it will be tight.  I'd just leave it alone until 
you get your trip over with and then fix it as quickly as possible.  Be 
sure and check your oil frequently and listen to the engine since you will 
be driving blind.
