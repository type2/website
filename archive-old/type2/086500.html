Subject: Re: [T2] Brakes!!  Pad, Shoes, oh MY!

ok,

my new brake shoes did not come with that emergency brake lever thing
attached to it, and the old ones had it rivited to it, so getting the old
one back was not easy. not to mention I may have bent it into a shape other
than the original in the process. What would be the best way to attach this
to the shoes, get a bolt/clip thing from someone that would have originally
gone with this, or try to get that actual emergency brake lever (a new one
anyway) along with it, just to have all new hardware back there?

ugh, this has been one of those projects where all of the tools are not
where I need them, I don't have all the parts I thought I had, etc.

i'll get this figured out, my patience just got a little razzled today
getting hung up on one step after the other, and needed to vent a little.
thanks for listening, im sure by now your thinking &quot;... been there a few
times..&quot;

calling it quits and ready for tomorrow morning... =)
