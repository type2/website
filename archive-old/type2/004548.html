Have you tried Wolfsburg West for the seals?  You can reach them at
www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com.

Hope they can help you - they have been great for me.

&gt; Perry,
&gt;
&gt; My '78 used to have some soft foam rubber on the back of the flaps, but
this
&gt; had long since fallen to pieces when I got the bus.  You may like to stick
&gt; some rubber (or polyurethane) draft proofing strip on them (the sort you
put
&gt; on doors and windows at home).  Make sure it's good and squishy or it
won't
&gt; make much difference.
&gt; There is a 'nut' on the linkage (+ a locknut) that you can turn to adjust
&gt; the length.
