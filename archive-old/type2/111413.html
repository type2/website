Subject: Main bearing flange size

So I'm putting together a frankenstein engine. 1600 SP. Took it apart
&amp; the main bearing is very loose. Nice wallowed out dowel pin in the
bearing. In the wilson book he mentions that in some cases the case
surface the bearing flange sits in can be faced &amp; larger bearings
inserted. It says these bearings were offered in 1.0, 1.5 &amp; 2.0 mm
oversize. What I can't find out is what the actual size of the stock
bearing surface should be so I can measure to see if it's even
possible to get a bearing that will work. Right now the bearing will
slide back and forth in it's seat because of the looseness.

      
Horrible ascii art below:

if this shows the case half at the main bearing (flywheel)
		 
		 __            __ &lt; from here
		  |            |    
		  |            |      to
		 _|            |_ &lt; here   
		 
what is the stock distance between the front &amp; rear shoulders of the
case. I checked out the Bentley &amp; WOG &amp; came up empty. Hopefully
someone can shed some light on it. I'd just like to know if it's
possible to save this engine case.
