Subject: Re: [T2] Timing Issues

Tom,
First, did you verify that when #1 is at TDC firing position with the 
timing mark aligned at the TDC mark (not sure what it is for that model 
- I think the case seam?) that the distributor is pointing at #1 firing 
position?  I would also check to make sure your distributor gear is 
aligned correctly.  Check the bentley and/or muir for the exact details.

As far as timing, you want to time it according to what engine you are 
running, not what distributor you are running.  You can tell if it's a 
009 by the fact that there's no vacuum canister.

&gt; other side of TDC.  Any ideas?  Also, how do I know if I have a stock 
&gt; distributor or an .009?  The guy I bought this from said he had put in
