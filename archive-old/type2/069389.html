JBVWnut_at_webtv_dot_net (James Molter Jr.) asked:

also has anyone purchased and installed the new grey fiberboard panels
from wolfsburg west? if so how do they look and fit? especially the
headliner panels they are really hard to duplicate. 

VanBondo says:
Received these items last Tuesday 11/26/96...
I highly recommend these items. Fit, color, quality is great on all pieces.
Cost is &lt;for once&gt; appropriate to the application and especially when
compared to the alternatives. I have no connection to Wolfsburg West but
*should* be a major stockholder by now! ;-)
