&gt; Some of you may recall the trouble fellow list member John Baird was having
&gt; with an issue where he couldn't get up to speed with his bus. Turns out he had
&gt; 2 problems: a cracked head and a worn cam lobe. He found a good cam and
&gt; lifters (thanks Michael Knight), but John
&gt;
&gt; needs a good 2 litre head on the driver's side (the one tapped for the temp.
&gt; sensor). His bus is a 77 and so he needs the oval ports, not the square port

Ron up at Bus Depot has good rebuilt heads for less than $200.  Most all
heads now are left/right and have the temp sensor hole on both sides.
