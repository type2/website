Subject: RE: Replacing Wheel Bearings? (fwd)

&gt; &gt; On this subject, I now have these as prepackaged
&gt; &gt; Kits.  I am importing German Febi/Bilstein kits directly from Germany.
The
&gt; &gt; reason is that most of the &quot;German&quot; brands are now selling Malaysian and
&gt; &gt; Mexican bearings in the U.S., packaged under the German name, whereas
Febi
&gt; &gt; in Germany is still offering these 100% German kits.


&gt; What are the part numbers and prices?  I didn't see
&gt; them listed on Bus Depot web site.


Front Wheel Bearing &amp; Seal Kit (contains bearings &amp; seals for one wheel),
68-79 Bus, German!   $16.95    211 405 645K
Rear Wheel Bearing &amp; Seal Kit (contains bearings &amp; seals for one wheel),
