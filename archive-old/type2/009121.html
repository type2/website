In my old 71 Bus I carried a 2x4 cut to just the right length so I could
jam it against the brake pedal and wedge it under the front lip of my
seat-lets you move away from your brick, &quot;park&quot; it with stick, jump out to
get brick,  jump back in, remove stick, and take off!  BTW, I carried
pieces of 2x4.  If you use a foot long piece, you can kick it out away from
the wheel.
quoth Vandela and Al Brase:
&gt; My emergency brake is a brick. I carry it in the back of my bus. I just
&gt; stick it behind the back wheel when I park on an incline if there isn't a
 curb to turn the wheels against.

Vandela:
BTDT, but it sure is hard to get it out when you're by yourself (unless
you don't care about keeping it).:^(
