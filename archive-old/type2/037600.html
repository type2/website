(Sorry about the previous message - I forgot to change the status text!)

We're still waiting for the DNS records to get updated.  It's just a 
sit-and-wait process at this point.

This is an informational message being sent to all of the subscribers
to the vintagebus and type2 lists, and no reply is necessary.

If you're getting this message, but had previously unsubscribed to
the list, don't fret!  I'm using an archived copy of the list
membership, which you may still be on.  When I update the archive,
you won't get these informational message any more.  Sorry about that...

You can also check the status of the list at

Thank you for your patience.
