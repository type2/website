	Well here's another data point/experience. The china I ordered
&gt;from Small Island Trader arrived in perfect condition last Sunday, and
we paid no duty on it. In fact, the USPS delivered it on SUNDAY since it
was sent the UK equivalent of International Priority. Considering what we
paid for shipping and handling- approaching $60, we certianly should have
gotten good service but I wasn't expecting Sunday delivery!
	Total value of the goods bought was listed on the box as UKP 110, 
roughly $180, and we were not charged an import duty.

	This is relevant to the bus list because various folks have
asked about buying expensive stuff from UK, etc, and having it mailed
to the USA. I believe this $180 order is the most expensive thing I've
ever bought from a business overseas with full commercial paperwork.
No duties paid yet.

	Happy motoring!
	Bill
