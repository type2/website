Hi Oliver,

Your compression numbers are not great, but the engine should still 
run. Heck, I've driven hundreds of miles on engines with one cylinder 
at ZERO.

A couple of quick ideas....

Make sure there is power at the coil, then look for spark at the plugs.

How many wires are attached to the coil? There should be a black wire 
running over to the double relay and a white wire in a grey sheath that 
runs to the wiring harness attached to the ECU. Either wire off will 
make the engine inoperative.

The next suggestion would be to put a vacuum gauge on it and test it. 
If you're not pulling at least 14&quot; or more then the FI won't be able to 
do its job. At that point it just becomes a search for the leak.

Happy trails,

&gt; As mentioned previously the bus (1978 FI 2.0) just quit on the 
&gt; freeway. Since having it flatbedded home, I've changed the fuel 
&gt; filter, fuel pump, ignition coil, points, condenser, rotor, cap, plugs 
&gt; and wires. She still won't catch. I don't know what else to do. Any 
&gt; suggestions?
