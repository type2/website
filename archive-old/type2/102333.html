&gt;Dirt-catching things seemingly related to cabin heating, which we don't 
&gt;need in the tropics. Sheet metal plates and ducts at either side of the 
&gt;engine, plastic box with small fan and hoses next to the air filter, flex 
&gt;hose under the chassis, cable for little doors, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Can some of this stuff go, in the interest of keeping things clean and 
&gt;tidy? Anything need to be plugged afterward?

Everything can go except for these plates which you need for cooling:
