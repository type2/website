Subject: Re: [T2] Perplexing Oil Leak(s)

get all 5 plugs tapped and then screw in replacement plugs.  I've had 
one pop out in the rear of the engine and one in the front.  You'll dump 
out your oil *real* quick if they pop out.

&gt; I drove a 78 bus back from Provo and it had a slight oil leak right under
&gt; the coil that was easily managed by checking and adding to the oil every
&gt; time I stopped for gas.  Right now it won't hold oil for more than 2 minutes
&gt; and leaks from the following places: under the coil, from above the heater
&gt; box for pistons 3 &amp; 4 and from the front (or is it rear, next to tranny)
&gt; main seal.
