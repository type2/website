Chris,

This was my excact first thought--a portable room AC unit----
You can't get much simplier than that--no doubt--neat fast, ultra
simple.
However the cost factor was the drawing line on this Rube Goldberg
project----

I'm talking like $795.00 for this type of contraption---vs, 135.00 max
for the small window unit. 

Plus these room units weight anywhere from 75 to 85 lbs---

Annd they are also not small--I believe they are about 3 ft tall, and
not tiny in curcumference, so they would take up mucho el roomo--

These factor's changed my mind real quick--

Later,

Terry
