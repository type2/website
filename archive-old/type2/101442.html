Subject: [T2] Oil cooler

&gt; I have another question to ask.   My oil cooler leaks and i want to
replace
&gt; it.  Is can you replace it without haveing to take the whole engin out?
The
&gt; engin is a 74 1800cc. Thanks everyone.

Almost any engine repair that does not involve access to the flywheel
or splitting the case can be done with the engine installed.
Can I do it ? Yes. Can you ? Debatable. Is it easier? For me, it is.
Contrary to popular list recommendation, and many fewer bolts.
Full access to the cooler requires fan housing removal.
Access to the seals only requires moving the fan housing an inch :)

Is your cooler leaking, or does it just have bad seals?
Or does a leak from somewhere else lead you to think it's
the cooler? The &quot;my oil cooler leaks&quot; syndrome is often resolved
by replacing a perfectly good cooler,then tracing the leak.
Possible locations include the oil filter sealing ring,mount,gasket,
oil sender, cylinder base gasket, push rod tubes, crankshaft seal,etc.
