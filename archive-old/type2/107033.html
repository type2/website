&gt; &gt; It's not that simple.
&gt; 
&gt; There was a private exchange afterwards. My
&gt; recommendation were to test the
&gt; softness of each lifter and follow the Boston Engine
&gt; advice.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, Karl pointed out correctly that the VW advice is 2
&gt; turns and
&gt; experience says less, the collective wisdow in the
&gt; archives favoring 1.5
&gt; turns.

ok....so I'll be tightening them up 'til I get .006
space....than tighten up One turn just to be paranoid...a
complete turn really screws things down a lot!  than after
determining it's ok, driving it around with a little
clatter for soome local driving, the next day will tightem
sown another .25 to .5 turn.._dot_depending on where that puts
things with the valve...right? makes more sense to be
carefull
