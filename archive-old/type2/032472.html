Here's the  pitch.
A 30ish fellow, wife and two you children, and there two buses. 
Hilarious antics ensue as they try to pay the bills, keep the buses 
running and prevent those around them from being consumed by mediocrity.&lt;&lt;


Hey, Wait one minute!!!  This reads exactly like the screenplay for my Autobiography I was about to pitch to the networks!!!  I demand royalties if you get any action from this!!!!
