Ah, yes, that must be why it is called the *idle* mixture adjustment screw.
D'oh.

&gt; There are 2 other things that affect mixture while driving: pressure and the
&gt; temp reading at the cylinder head temp sender.  Higher pressure will cause a
&gt; richer mixture = the injectors open by time only. They don't know how much
&gt; fuel goes through them. Higher pressure = higher volume = richer mixture.

Right.  And, as I know my pressure is higher than it should be, my first step
is to get it down.

&gt; The temp sensor reads engine temp. The colder the engine = the longer the
&gt; injectors stay open = the richer the mixture.

Yes, the archives are full of very helpful messages posted by you that detail a
slew of resistance tests.  Of course, I did all of those (and came up with
nothing abnormal) *before* I tested the fuel pressure.  I was half pleased with
all the positive results.

And I gather that, if getting the fuel pressure down to where it belongs
doesn't produce the desired effect (lower CO emissions), then my focus will be
on the AFM, and it's itty bitty inner workings.  The cap on mine comes off
easily (I discovered this when I bumped it once).  I don't know if that means
somebody has been in there tinkering with it already, or if the silicon
caulking Bosch used to seal it up had loosened its grip.
