Subject: [T2] really that simple?

&gt;I'm a very new bus owner ( '74 camper)
Welcome to the neverending list.
&gt; Did I really fix what all those paid mechanics couldn't?
YES !
&gt; Would that air cleaner connection flopping around really cause that much loss of power?
No.
&gt;Could it be that it sat on there OK when the demand on the engine
&gt;was lower and then &quot;lifted&quot; off as I went or tried to go faster?
No.
&gt; I would like to be sure I'm OK before I let the shop off the hook.
Better just let them know you did a little reading and fixed it yourself.
Let's come up with something interesting for that. ( like reversed plug wires ).

&gt;This story is A LOT longer than this so I hope I have not left out important details.

Relevent info would include something like 74 1.8L non-Cal bus with dual PDSIT 3/4
carbs and dual vacuum advance distributor # X-XXX-XXX, mileage since last rebuild,
compression test #'s, and whatever it was you accidently touched  that caused the
engine to regain all that horsepower ! ( Keep reading those manuals:)
