&gt;Does anyone have experience with
&gt;this &quot;header wrap&quot;?

Jay:

I've had my exhaust manifolds wrapped for at least six years now. 
Checked 'em out recently while refurbishing exhaust components, and they
are just as good as when I originally wrapped 'em.  I'd say the header
wrap looks to be holding up better than the original insulation jacket
that VW put on 'em.

Unlike Mr. Bulley, I did not wrap the afterburner pipes.  For one thing,
they were not originally insulated by VW, as the manifolds were, and for
another, they are made of a stainless steel and are quite durable. 
Unfortunately, the flanges on them are carbon steel, and that's what
corrodes away.

On this go'round with the exhaust system, I used J-B Weld to seal up the
ends of the heater boxes.  I've found that the hi-temp silicone really
can take the heat, but I figured that the J-B Weld would also serve to
strengthen the joint as well as seal it.
