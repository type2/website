Subject: [T2] FS '78 project

I have a project bus that I'm tired of looking at.  The romance of bringing
it back from the dead has worn off in the face of so many other projects.
It's been in my yard for over two years now and I have no intention of
finishing it while my '69 is running so well.  The body is in fair
condition, but will never see concours again - lots of little dings around
the bottom.
The details:
rebuilt short block - I did it myself, and did a decent job of it.  I'm not
a real mechanic, just a guy with access to a machine shop and some measuring
tools.   The case, and presumably the crankshaft is from a 411, which gives
a displacement of 1700cc.  I cc'd the heads and with the current barrells
the compression ratio was within spec.  I don't recall what the exact
numbers were, it was a while ago when I did it.  I was going to try to use
one of the old heads, but one of the exhaust manifold studs pulled out
(twice) and I got another head to replace it.  I still haven't installed the
second new head.  A pic of the engine is at:

Dual solex carbs as spec'd on the '72 models.  I have a pair of rebuild
kits, but haven't used them either.
The tranny is of unknown functionality - I got this bus as a non-runner, and
the engine is a ways from going back in.
good brakes, acceptable tires
BN4 heater  - don't know if it works
The roof used to leak, until I replaced the top vent and re mounted the roof
rack, which are barely visible in the picture at:

Spares:
A westy z-bed frame and a riviera z-bed frame
2 piece fixed rear bench seat
A box of fuel injection parts of unknown usability.
A few boxes of other stuff I can't recall

There's lots of good parts there, and it could be parted out or completed
and run, but I'm not gonna be the one to do it.  Too much other stuff to do.
I'm looking for $800 obo, or most interesting trade for all of it.  You
haul.
Located in Centralia, WA.  And no, I won't split it up.
