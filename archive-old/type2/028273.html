Sometimes you should be concerned; sometimes you'll be benefitting from a syndrome common to many hobbies...someone buys the thing for something to do, fixes what they can fix and then get bored with it...selling it at a loss, or trying to break even or make a profit. Often they'll sell for a loss...they've already got the next project picked out or bought and they need to divorce themselves from this one to move full-steam on the next.

I would be most concerned about the *quality* of the rebuild. Most hobby garage rebuilds are just that and worth no more than $400, even when done well. Sometimes you'd be better off without an engine at all. Depends largely on how and why the person rebuilt the engine. Were they planning on selling the bus or keeping it? Is this their first rebuild or their seventeenth? Did they have the engine built or buy a rebuild?

If you will become familiar with the various systems comprising a bus and diagnose each system for strengths and weaknesses, you'll be far happier. Learn to ask questions and act stupid a little. People who do shoddy work on buses will tell on themselves by making claims like: &quot;Hey VWs are easy to work on. You just slap in some new rings and heads and it's as good as new.&quot; or &quot;Hey man, you can rebuild one of these things for $300.&quot;

A $300 rebuild isn't worth 20 cents. 

All these are my informed opinions. Others will disagree and each case warrants evaluation. Don't get a bus that you won't keep though. I've done that several times and it always costs me more to get it running and reliable than I can possibly get back out of it when I sell it. If you want a passenger bus, buy one of those; if you want a camper, buy a camper. If you want a shortie bus, well, you're a freak and need psychological help. ;-)

Have fun! Joe

&gt;in looking at bus ads in the classifieds, i see a lot of them have very
&gt;recently  rebuilt, new or replaced engines. often these have less than 5000
&gt;miles on them. am i being paranoid, or is this something to be suspicious
&gt;of?
&gt;
&gt;if i look at a bus with a really new or very recently rebuilt engine on it,
&gt;what kind of warning signs should i look for when test driving it?
&gt;
