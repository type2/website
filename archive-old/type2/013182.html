&gt;I am thinking of replacing the nuts on both my split and Vangon with the
&gt;late-bay style, and would love input from anyone who has been there.  I
&gt;believe the axle stub never changed, and I belive that the split nut will
&gt;fit under the dust cover on any year, but I have not (obviously) tried it
&gt;yet.  Does anyone have experience to report?

Vanagons:

It sort of works.  You can use two of the correct (right hand thread)
bay nuts on the Vanagon, ie from 2 buses, BUT they stick out way
further than the Vanagon crimp nut.  Problem here being that they
hit the little hub covers, so you use bay hub covers (taller), problem
then being that the speedo cable is too short so you shove it out further
problem being....

You get the idea, did it on the '85 when I had to, in fact it may still be
on there, don't have it anymore obviously.

Of course Steve knows I got no clue on the split thing.

I've had murderous problems with Vanagon crimp nuts only when I
try to reuse them, you can MAYBE get 2 uses if you reverse them and
hope the tolerances make them come to a different place, but all that
stuff is pretty darn close tolerance amazingly enough.  Another thing
is not to crimp them but in the one location you are supposed to.  I
used to bang em down (particularly on re-use) in more than 1 location
(3 grooves in the spindle for various stuff) but that deforms the little
crimp area so, that none of the 3 really clamp all that hard anymore.
