Assuming you don't want to remove the dist. due to correct timing already 
done - do this...

Remove the nut that attaches the dist. clamp to the case. This way you can 
remove the dist. and then reinstall it without affecting the timing.

While the dist. is out, you can remove the rear fuel pump mounting nut with 
a short 13mm wrench. I use a combo wrench - open at one end and closed at 
the other end because it is the wrench I've got that is a reasonable length.

There should be an 'O' ring on the dist. shaft below the dist. clamp. If 
you replace it, cut the old 'O' ring and walk the new one on with a 
screwdriver (you can stretch it quite a bit without breaking the new 'O' ring.

Use WD-40 as much as you like to walk the ring up the bottom of the dist. 
shaft. While it is out, why not use some carb cleaner to clean the dist. up 
well (outside) if it is an old one and a mess. I like working on clean 
engines. My engine is sterile. (put your dirty minds in park... &lt;grin&gt;)

Reinstall the dist. and tighten the 13mm nut with a socket on a long enough 
extension and ratchet handle.

Done.

You may wonder why you engine is leaking in these places in the first 
place, and I'll bet that you have excessive blow by - your piston rings are 
wearing out.

Question - is the generator pedestal the original style and is the breather 
clogged up or venting correctly? It should bleed off any pressure built up 
in the crankcase.

Recommendation - buy Muir's 'Idiot Book' and Bentley's factory shop manual. 
They have been the most valuable books on my shelf. Muir isn't always right 
in every detail but her is just about the best writer of descriptions for 
home mechanic there is (to me...) and Bentley is good to verify his 
procedures and shows very good pictures. To me they are to be used together.

With these books I have learned to do everything on my bus. It has never 
been to a mechanic since I have owned it. You are the only mechanic you can 
trust (and us too...)

I am making a big dangerous assumption that you are pretty new to all this. 
If I screwed up, just ignore me completely.

Take care and have a great week!

&gt;vacuum advance dist.  I am leaking on the left side of my engine case.  I 
&gt;had that happen before, but it was my carbs throttle shaft.  So I got a 
&gt;new carburetor.  But now its leaking again.  it looks like its from the 
&gt;base of the distributer(at the case).  I guess it could be from the gasket 
&gt;at the fuel pump flange(black plastic thing) but I just tigtened the bolts 
&gt;on the fuel pump and its leaking more down the left of the case than to 
&gt;the right of the fuel pump. It is a little moist at the base of the 
&gt;distributer butI just got a new &quot;pinch clamp&quot; on the distributer and a new 
&gt;bolt on it as well as a new distributer shortly before that.  I tightened 
&gt;the bolt that attaches the distributer to the case and the pinch bolt 
&gt;clamp again just a second ago.
&gt;
&gt;Is it possible that I am missing a gasket or seal at the base of the 
&gt;distributer?  I wouldn't think my mechanic forgot or reused the seal when 
&gt;he put on the new pinch clamp and replaced distributer. but then again...
&gt;
&gt;Also how to I get to that front bolt on the fuel pump the one towards the 
&gt;fan shroud, the hard one to reach :)  ....
&gt;
&gt;I have a feeling your all gonna tell me I have to remove my distributer 
&gt;and check for the gasket and tighten that fuel pump bolt then huh...??
&gt;
&gt;TIA
&gt;
