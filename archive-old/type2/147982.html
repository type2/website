Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Head replacement update

Don't feel too bad.  I also misread the torque wrench when I replaced 
my heads.   I ended up with 21 inch pounds instead of 21 ft 
pounds.  Naturally, this was discovered after I installed the 
engine.  And no, you can't reach all of the head bolts with the 
engine in, so I had to pull it out, re-torque, and re-install (alone).

That was a long day.

&gt;New torque wrench. I think we were reading the settings incorrectly
&gt;and setting the torque too high. Live and learn.
&gt;
&gt;That might explain 3 damaged studs. Thank goodness I didn't mess up the case.
