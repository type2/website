David:

It was encouraging to hear of your telephone exchange with MSHP.

Nevertheless, if a crack reaches a valve seat, I'd worry about it.  I've
been wondering if VW &quot;allowed&quot; these as acceptable simply as a gamble
that they'd last as long as the current owner had 'em, which was better
than admitting to a flaw as in the subsequent water-cooled case.

Yeah, OK, we're ready to cut MSHP some slack because they seem to have
been willing to work with you.  On the other hand, I wouldn't be able to
sell somebody heads like that without pointing out the [apparent?] flaws
to them right up front.  This seems a bit like &quot;we'll work with you if
you catch us&quot;.

As far as doing your own heads, I agree that welding aluminum is
problematic.  But the rest of it isn't that much of a hassle, even if
you take the heads to a local machine shop.  At least if they blow out a
chunk of cylinder head it'll be an issue right up front and out in the
open.  What I was thinking, however, was doing your own otherwise good
heads - i.e. not full of cracks.

I wonder if anyone on the list has any comments on heads they've gotten
from Bob Donalds, at Boston Engine?

Giff
