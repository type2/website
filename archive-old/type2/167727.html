Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing just the electrical part of late bay
  ignition switch

On Fri, 9 Nov 2007, courtney hook wrote:

&gt; Hey listees, I read the article in the Type 2 library tech bulletins about redoing the ignition switch on a late bay, and it looks like the electrical part of the switch is just held in with a small grub screw. All I want to do is replace the electrical part; the mechanical key part is fine. Has anyone done this replacement WITHOUT removing the whole column as advised by this article? The article in the tech writeup section makes it look rather daunting.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney

I'm waiting for this too, I read the bulletins and have the new part
in hand but I look up under there and decide to work on something
else.   put on new heads, buy an engine, weld up a door panel,
anything.  that job looks very hairy.

thanks
