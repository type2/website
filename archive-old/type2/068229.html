&gt;Hi everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Well, yesterday I had my first experience with the dreaded 
&gt;crappy-ass valve cover gaskets (T1)  One blew on my way to work
&gt;so I had to drive with my windows open to ward off asphyxiation
&gt;.  My friend brought me another set, which turned out to be 
&gt;worse than the original gasket. (BTW-- The 1st ones had only
&gt;been on the bus for 4 weeks)   I had to stop 3 times on the 
&gt;way home to clear the smoke out of the bus and re-fill with oil
&gt;.  I put another on last night, even glued it to the valve 
&gt;cover with permatex (cured, let to dry, etc.) I did it like I 
&gt;always did on my bug (never leaked).  Only difference is, on 
&gt;the bug, I used the ultra-thick black rubber-impregnated cork
&gt;gaskets.  My source for those has dried up, so I have been 
&gt;forced to buy the cheap cork things.
&gt;
&gt;My question... Anybody got a source for the GOOD T1 valve cover
&gt;gaskets?!?!?  I'm willing to mail order.  Also, does anyone
&gt;even know what I'm talking about?
&gt;
&gt;TIA,

Hi Blake,

My method has always been to coat the entire gasket with vaseline.
It soaks into the cork and 'softens' it.  The key thing at that point
is to make sure that the surfaces are clean and she seals right. They
always come off easily (unbroken), and they get replaced when they
NEED to get replaced.  Squiggle the covers around gently until they
hit a spot where they won't move.  O' course, make sure the covers
are OK...flat surfaces and clean.  Perhaps there's a burr on your
heads somewhere ?  

Hope it helps, Good Luck,
