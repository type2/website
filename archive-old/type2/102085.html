Subject: Re: [T2] 70 westy-front wheel knock

&gt;biggest question is... &quot;what could this clunking be?&quot; and &quot;will it snap
&gt;while i am driving?&quot;

Remote possibility that the noise you hear is actually coming from the rear 
of the vehicle, and is being transmitted through the chassis, making it hard 
to localize.  My guess would be a CV.  Will it snap?  Yes.  If you keep 
driving in it it will, or it will sieze.  When?  That is the $24 question.
