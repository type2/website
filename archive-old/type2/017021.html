Much thanks to everyone for all the great response to my &quot;tallest gear
ratio&quot; questions!
This list is great and I apreciate not getting flamed for the question
in the first place.

About four months ago I completed an eighteen month project slipping an
86 subaru turbocharged engine into my 76 westy. I had dropped a valve
seat in the stock motor and was disappointed at the parts estimate to
rebuild it.

The Suby puts out 115 HP -- almost twice the stock motor HP. I don't
drive fast and that was not my intention. I do enjoy going up any hill
at 65 and getting on the freeway or passing slower drivers safely.

I would simply like to keep the motor in the low 3's when I'm cruising
at 65 or 70 (legal on some lonely stretches). At present I'm doing about
3600 or better and the motor just doesn't need to spin that fast to
develop enough horsepower to mash the wind away.

Todd hill at Volkswerks sounds like my best resource on this issue and
I'll be contacting him soon.

Thanks again everyone!
