Hi Richard

That is probably EXACTLY the same,, I didn't know the rest of the world had my ideas
exactly!

I happened to own a 76 double slider bus that had the 3 element euro headlights,, so
I copied them.
it also had the recoil seat belts, and a Kilometers dash, so I transplanted them in
MY 74.

After I copied the headlights ,, I found they were available ..online,. and have
been addicted to the internet every since!

Still working on the stock headlight switch...
