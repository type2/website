That appears to match the plaid that's in my '79 Campmobile, though, which
matches the door panels.
Ugly, but kind of endearing, like your grandmother's old couch.

What drugs were they on when they picked that green for the headrests and seat
vinyl??
I hope they sell matching door panels.....you have to be totally colorblind to
see it does not even come close
to the drivers door panel of the bus they have the seats sitting in.

&gt; Got $1000 for new seats?
