&gt; What is the absolutely cheapest solution from the cylinder heads to the

&gt; Unless there's a manifold I can bolt between the head and the triangular

&gt; haven't talked to them about it yet. Been too busy working on the bus!)

Here are a lot of diagrams with the different exhaust system:

The exhaust dance (at least for stock parts) is this. apparently the
75-78 exhaust parts are a huge pain to find and a lot are NLA. I don't
own these years so things could have changed recently. Lots of people
look into replaceing the exhaust with a 72-74 so they can get the
muffler. However I realy suspect you can find what you need at a
boneyard. 

&gt; What should I be looking for to find out if I really have a 1700 or a 2000? 
&gt; Is there an engine number somewhere that will tell me?

Not for sure. but a look here should give you some idea. Look for the
number on the case itself, not the fan housing. this still doesn't
mean that the engine is still a stock displacement. :(

Don, hang in there, you will get it going. Just takes patience and
time
