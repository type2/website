Subject: Re: Engine Hesitation

&gt; read Muir on the why centrifigal advance is more reliable than vacum.  
I haven't read that, but no matter what it says, it's one man's opinion.
&gt; What I'm saying is Learn to drive your volkswagen! If it means riding the 
&gt; clutch alittle to smooth the dead spot, then do it. Don'be a baby about a 
&gt; little hesitation!!!!!
Sorry, I can't accept that.  To me, a more appropriate comment might be, 
&quot;Stand up and do something about that hesitation - don't be a baby and put 
up with it&quot;.  It's got nothing to do with learning how to drive.

Dave, 
Please read page 104 of Muir 'vacuum advance distributors are a sop to 
american car buyers who
don't want to learn how to shift their VWs.'

I lump vacuum advance distributors in with Automatic transmissions and air 
conditioners, things VW did
to compete with American cars that made the owner do less and feel good. Also 
you should read Hoovers 
essay 'the forever car' which touches on these issues. The reason I belabor 
this point is that it goes to the very crux
of everything we talk about here - do you lump your self in with 'american 
car buyers'  or with someone who loves and lives 
and feels his or her VW?  If the former is true, you might spend $6,000 
making unnatural changes to a VW in the name of
american feel-good ammenities, like HEAT, etc.   I for one don't buy into any 
of that philosophy. In my opinion the 009 is more
stock than the vacuum advance distributor, and its the only concession I make 
to customization. 

p.s. no offence meant to anyone when I used the word 'baby' yesterday.
