Subject: ONE ONLY genuine VW trans $965

One of my distributors has ONLY ONE four-speed Vanagon trans, genuine German
Volkswagen overstock, that he wants to get rid of.  He lists it as fitting
'80-85, I list it as '80-83, so if you have a waterleaker Vanagon it's your
gamble, but if yours is aircooled you're definately safe. (Any trans experts
on the list who can confirm whether or not '80-85 would be the same?)  He's
backing it up with a 12 month/12,000 mile warranty against defects.

Price is $965 plus $75 continental-US shipping.  No core deposit, no core
return hassle. This is about half of VW retail.  He's holding it for me for
24 hours as a courtesy.  If someone wants it, e-mail me or call ASAP before
it's gone.  This is a really good deal for a genuine VW trans.  Someone
should grab it.  Last time I found a deal like this on a new VW trans you
guys never heard about it 'cause I bought it for myself. :-)
