Subject: Backfiring on Decel and jerky cruising ...

So I had my bus tuned and now it backfires when I decelerate and it 
wont run smoothly when I am cruising !

Its SUPER strong on acceleration, idles really nicely but the above 
problems are not cool, the cruising seems to be jerky, like its missing 
or something.
It has NEVER backfired before, wasnt when I brought it in, so I am 
wondering what can cause this !?

It didn't do this BEFORE my tuneup, and they have agreed to correct it, 
but I am curious as to what it is before I take it in !

Any ideas ?
