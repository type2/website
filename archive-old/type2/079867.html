&gt; I was doing some investigation on my heat system the other day, and noticed 
&gt; that there's a duct that seems to come up someplace around or between the 
&gt; two front seats. A while back, somebody on the list said that the knob on my 
&gt; front seat managed this vent (while others said it was vestigial, for 
&gt; auxilliary heaters only). Well, I played around with the knob some, pulling 
&gt; and twisting every which way, lifting the carpets and feeling for airflow, 
&gt; but I didn't find a thing. Should there be some kind of vent in this area? 
&gt; Could that duct be blocked somehow?

the duct outlet is between the seats facing rearward right where there is
the small step down into the rear part of the van.  on my 78 it
is(was) controlled by one of the two red knobs on the heat control on the
dash, other years may be other ways
