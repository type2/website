Subject: Broken Fuel Injector Bolt

So, I'm changing the rings and hose on my fuel injectors. ('76 westy, 
2.0L non-Cali) Finished up the last injector, put it back in the hole, 
line up the ring, put the nut on, tighten it down....  and the bolt pops 
out of its hole.  Hmmm...

Now, I'm not sure if the bolt sheared off, or if the hole is stripped. 
The bolt only turns for a couple threads, but that's not enough to hold 
it in place when I tighted down the nut.  Either way I figure I'm in for 
it, 'cause I'm probably going to have to replace the manifold tubes.

Does anyone have a spare one of these injector bolts, and can tell me 
how long it's supposed to be?

Also, it looks like a tight fit getting to the bolts that hold on the 
manifold tubes.  Is it even possible to take those off without dropping 
the engine?

Thanks,
-Charles
