Importance: Normal

&gt; being an atheist+Christian, ex-Marxist + lifelong
&gt; Conservative voter, sciencey book reader + artistic ex-farmers' wife,
Texan
&gt;  Brit. (Reciprocal hospitality offered to List members visiting Britain.)

You forgot to mention VW-bus owner but OK that speaks for itself.

I can't quite figure out whether your artistic wife was previously a farmer,
whether she was previousy married to a farmer or whether you yourself used
to be a farmer. That is not mutually exclusive with being a Christian or
atheist. Nor with being an ex-Marxist or voting Conservative. Well I'll say
you sound interesting. Whenever you're in Holland and want to talk about
this and / or buses you're most welcome.

Jan W Brier, The Netherlands.
