&gt;When it's cold, say sitting for a couple of hours, etc. it fires right
up but idles at about 600 RPM.  Then, after a couple minutes, when it's
hot, the RPM climbs to about 1100RPM.  The AUX air vlalve seems to
be OK.  I took it out cold and put 12V across the terminals and the
little slide closed in it.&lt;

I had a similar problem, which I fixed. The Aux air valve is adjustable.
Undo the nut and you'll see that you can slide it open or closed just a bit.
I opened mine as much as possible then tightened the nut. This lets in a little
more air when cold, but seems to close all the way when it is warm. 

I also cleaned it out with carb cleaner, put it in the freezer and the oven to
stretch it out. But I don't think those were necessary.

Good luck!
