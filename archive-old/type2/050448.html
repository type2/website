Subject: [T2] SO-69 Stove and fridge

Hello all,
  Last night I aquired a stove/fridge/cabinet from another Bus owner. He
traded me the American Westy interior for the SO-69 Euro style. It came out
of a 70 Euro Bus, non walk through, I put it in my 71 regular Westy.  So I
have been trying to get some info on how to make it all work. 
  First off, the fridge is an Electrolux and is electri, not Gas. The one on
the type 2 library page said that they are Gas. Mine says 12v and has no gas
inputs. It does have two wires going to it though. One is a German shore
power type plug, and the other looks like a german cigerette lighter plug.
There is also a push/pull switch on the side of the cabinet that does
something to the fridge. Anyone have a wiring diagram for this, or know
where the wires go and how the switch makes it work. 
  Second is the stove. It is propane. It runs off of some kind of small
refilable type bottle, however, I do not have those bottles. Inside the
cabinet under the sink is two leather straps, these must have held the
bottles.  The PO converted it to run off the Coleman throwaway bottles. But
I can not figure out the control valves. If you push it in, it seems like it
should make the igniter spark, but it does not. Then it only flows gas if
you push in and hold the knob in. How is this thing supposed to work? There
was also a vent under the sink in the floor, this is where the propane
bottles were, what is it for? Was it vust to vent off any propane leaks?
  I would love to get this whole thing working before I go camping in a few
weeks, any help would be great.
