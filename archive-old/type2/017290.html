&gt; I was going to run it outside, but we've had a storm system moving
&gt; through so I set up in the garage. Since I'm working in an enclosed
&gt; area, I bought an 8' length of flexible aluminum duct (like heavy-duty
&gt; dryer hookup stuff) at the home improvement store. Put one end over the
&gt; exhaust and the other out through the window where I removed a pane of
&gt; glass. Rolled up alum. foil as a gasket and then crushed the duct around
&gt; it to help seal up the exhaust pipe side. Also brought the CO detector
&gt; from the house and set it up near where I was working... never know when
&gt; you may have an exhaust leak.
&lt;snip&gt;
 6. Start the engine &amp; set idle at 500 to 700 RPM- I'm confused, how do
I
&gt; change the idle when they had me shut down the idle circuit? After this,
&gt; I'm supposed to adjust CO with vol. ctrl. screws. Tried using vol. ctrl.
&gt; screws to set the idle.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Here's the kicker that was in the archives- disconnect power from
&gt; idle cutoff solenoid on one carb (smaller, center solenoid) and note
&gt; decrease in RPM. The engine dies... I don't think they expect it to go
&gt; to 0RPM!
&gt; 
&gt; 8. Repeat step 7 on other carb- engine still dies!

Paul:
This 72-74 dual carb setup actually has 3 idle circuits, one in each
carb, plus the central one in the left hand carb. I've muddled my way
through the Bentley instructions many times about 15 years ago and I
assure you that it is possible to get it to run using their procedure.
Are both sides of the vacuum advance working? That was the stumbling
block for me. The larger-hose side (retard) had failed, and after
replacing that advance mechanism, it worked fine. This is one of those
instances where it would be great to read the factory publications
(dealer books) to see if they are any clearer. Does anyone out there
have access to such info? They may be in the form of factory service
bulletins or such.
I'd at least leave the door open with a box fan going to supply fresh
air while running this  in the garage. I knew a guy once who did tuneups
in his garage, had a heart attack and died from the fumes, not complete
carbon monoxide poisoning, but it pushed him over the edge. Devastated
the poor lad whose car it was he was fixing.
