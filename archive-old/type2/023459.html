Subject: Tires, propane, etc.
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

I am running the Michelin 'Agilis' mainly because one local tire shop stocked 
them. They keep them on hand for a local rental yard that uses them on a lot 
of their equipment. I noticed a ride difference to the better right away.
I had to have the '80 Vanagon's propane tank's valve replaced as it leaked 
when open. This is the valve on the tank you have to open to get gas into the 
system. The valve is a standard type that the local RV store had in stock. 
The thread is the same as the old standard 5 gallon portable tank. For those 
not wanting to spend the money for an original replacement you could just 
leave the plumbing in place and attach an extension hose to a portable tank 
when parked for camping. All you lose is the ability to run the refrigerator 
on propane other than when parked. So far I am able to find some places that 
will fill the tank. 
One side affect of the bay window bus heating system pulling air from inside 
the engine compartment was finding a fuel leak. Even though our days have 
been hot, one cool morning I opened the heat flaps and noticed a raw gasoline 
odor. I expect a little if I don't wait long enough after starting up but it 
persisted all the way to work. I looked in the engine bay at work but saw 
nothing because the heat had evaporated the fuel so quickly. I waited until 
everything cooled and ran the engine for a minute before it could warm up. I 
found the leak in the short hose from a fuel filter to the carb. It was 
soaked in gasoline. No problem now but could have been a disaster. Fuel lines 
are a little over a year old. I have ordered replacements for all the hoses. 

Thanks for the help on the 80 Vanagon heating and missing. The missing 
problem was the fault of the current owner. I had cross connected 3 &amp; 4 spark 
plug wires while replacing them. It runs smooth again. I have received good 
advice on things to check on the overheating at idle or in traffic.

What famous (to Americans especially from the South) mode of transportation 
was also named &quot;Traveler&quot;? PLEASE reply by pmail to me NOT the list! This is 
not bus related except I named my bus Traveler.
