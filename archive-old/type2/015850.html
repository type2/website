&gt;Here is how to solve the question:  How many list members have successfully
&gt;used the coil-over shocks, and how many have experienced unsuccessful
&gt;outcomes?  Only those with actual first-hand experience should respond.

Data point 1:  I have had them on my bus for years with no problems
whatsoever.  They lifted the rear a good inch and gave the bus a much
better stance.

Data Point 2 (Alternative): A few years ago my roomate bought a '73 bus
which had coilover springs on the rear.  The right rear upper shock mount
was broken off.  I don't know what the history of that bus was - it could
have been used for stunt driving for all I know, so take that into
consideration.  Repairing the mount was a nightmare - take that into
consideration too.

My own opinion:  The shock mounts take a *lot* of force when you hit a
bump, especially with stiff shocks and a heavy load.  I wouldn't think that
adding an additional 100 lbs (?) of force (from the springs) to the mount
would make an appreciable difference, especially under normal driving
conditions.  In fact, I'm betting on it.
