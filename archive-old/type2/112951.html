Subject: Re: [T2] Not sure I want the answer to this:(

Wow, weird coincidence, I'm going through the same thing. I'm finally
getting my '79 bus fixed after a long saga which involved replacing

both heads last summer.  I took the bus to (another) mechanic and it 
looks like the heads are shot after &lt;1000 miles.  I am getting the same 
low compression readings you are and thought my gauge was wacked, too.  
A leakdown test shows 80% leakage (!)  The mechanic just got the heads 
off Friday and said they leak like a seive (pouring solvent in, it all 
drains right out, as the valves are not sealing).  I don't have the 
boom, but had the same starting &amp; idling problems (which will happen 
when the compression sucks so bad).

My suggestion to you: get a leakdown test done and see if your heads are OK.

&gt; Greetings. My '78 has 17,956.4 miles on a rebuild in '99 by a
&gt; list-recommended, reputable builder. Last year when tuning her, I 
&gt; couldn't get
&gt; the idle right and she wouldn't run if timed at 7.5 BTDC. Now a year 
&gt; later I
&gt; am cooled off and ready to objectively correct any/all problems.  I 
&gt; got her
&gt; running, but she won't idle on her own.  There is a sound, kinda like an
&gt; irregular muffled 'boom' that sounds like a teenager's thunderous 
&gt; stereo with
&gt; too much bass is 2 cars away with the windows up. That is my best 
&gt; description.
&gt; For S&amp;G's, I decided to do a compression check.  Engine warm, all 
&gt; plugs out,
&gt; accelerater depressed and screw-in tester showed:
&gt; #1 50
&gt; #2 70
&gt; #3 40
&gt; #4 55
