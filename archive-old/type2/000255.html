I'll start with a big thank you for all of you who have lent a hand to get
me through my &quot;lack of power problem&quot;....
after reading through an amazing response, the dying of my engine (after a
few hours of continuos use) seems to have been chased to the tired old (28
yrs) coil.
I have a spanking ( ooooooh...doc-tor ) new coil and cannot contain myself
to wait till Monday for my 'maccie' to charge me to put it in........I would
like to attempt this SEEMINGLY simple task myself and save myself the time
and cash.(time sans van that is )
I have scanned the archive and library, but it seems that this topic isn't
explained......I can see what to do, but in the past when I've tried things
that look simple, there usually has been one 	SIMPLE thing that I have
overlooked and all hell has broken loose.
		She's a '71 twin port..now unleaded 1641cc
		The new coil is a Bosch
Any help is (once again) appreciated
Garp
