Subject: Non Walk through panels

Hi guys,

I am restoring a 1971 Non-walk through loaf, (which can be seen on the hope
page annotated below)and I want to purchase new panels for behind the seat.
 The problem is that all the panel vendors do not show in their catalogs
the center panel.  They show the panels with the fresh air duct cutouts but
not the center panel.  Has anybody had problems getting this panel special
made?  The bus is completely gutted and in the body shop at this time, so I
have some time to play with.  Any helpful suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.  Thanks

						Ray
