Subject: i'm new at this. Can someone help me?

Hello everyone

I'm looking for spare parts and help for my VW 1600 Transporter from 1968. It
was from my dad, and i've got a lot of excellent memories of trips across
Europe. I would like to try and keep it running and do the same with my wife
and my 2 year old son. I'm 31 years of age (younger than my bus....).
The bus is running well. Fortunatly the motor it's really fine and it starts
almost instantly, but it has some problems of rust and almost all of the
rubber seals are getting very dry and fragille.  I would like to try and do
some repair work on it and paint it also, but i'm afraid of taking off the
rubber seals....i think they will break apart if i do so....

My questions are:

1- can anyone help me in finding spare parts for it? (i found clip1_dot_com in the
US, but some items i need are &quot;out of stock)
2- can anyone indicate me someone that can give me some advise about repairing
the metal parts?

I would apreciate if you could help me....
Thanks a lot.

Best regards from Lisbon, Portugal
