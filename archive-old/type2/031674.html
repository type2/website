&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, it's an automatic, and the guy I'm buying it from says that it
&gt; doesn't go into 1st gear when you have it in drive, but you can get it
&gt; into 1st by putting the tranny in a lower gear manually.  He says a
&gt; mechanic told him there's a switch on the tranny that controls that that

no such switch, he needs a new mechanic.

&gt; needs to be replaced.  Anyone know if this is true, whether it's easy and
&gt; cheap, and whether it's worth the trouble?  I drove it a bit, and it
&gt; seemed to get going reasonably well (at least, for a bus:)

the 73 bus has a vacuum shift tranny.  the vacuum shifter can be adjusted
maybe that is what he means, but I would suspect a vacuum leak rather than
a problem with the vacuum valve.

this is an odd ball tranny but can be replaced with a late model tranny
(75-79) without too much hassle.

if it starts off from a stop without phutzing with the shifter, try it on
a hill....then I would wonder about it.._dot_can you feel it shift, 1-2  and
2-3...is it the downshift that it is not doing???

the more common problem is upshifting not downshifting...sit at stop on a
hill, put it in drive, basically give it solid gas...you should get the
1-2 upshift around 15-20mph  and the 2-3 upshift around 35-45 don't listen
to the tranny but rather listen to the engine RPMs' the VW tranny can be
very deceptive in it's shifting.  because it is a planetary drive it
shifts quite smoothly

sorry if I wasn't much help but need a bit more data to go on.
