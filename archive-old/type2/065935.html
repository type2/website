Subject: Painting small rust spots

Until I get around to sanding down the entire vehicle for it's eventual 
complete repainting, I'd like to take care of the small (dime size and 
smaller) stone chips that have created little rust spots on various 
sections of the body. My intent is purely to create a stop gap measure to 
prevent rust from continuing it's incessant march. I realize this is not 
a long term cure.

Given that, here what I *think* I should do (comments invited):

1) Wire wheel the affected area down to bare metal.

2) Feather sand the paint out to about an inch away from the bare metal.

3) Clean the area with some type of metal prep (don't know exactly what 
or which)

4) Mask off area.

5) Spray with some kind of primer. It'd be much easier if this primer 
were in a spray can of sorts. If someone has a preferred brand I'd love 
to know which.

Is that all? Am I missing something here?

Thanks in advance,

Bren
