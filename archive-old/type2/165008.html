driver didn't present any.   So far no one can get ahold of driver or
owner to see if there's any other insurance to cover it.&quot;

David,
	See if your state has an insurance commission or department or
agency.  If it does there may be a fund to cover uninsured drivers and
owners.  I know here in NY there is such a fund, but it's almost a secret,
they don't give that info out, you have to ask..  Like all governmental
agencies it's a real maze of red tape and paperwork but in the end it may be
worth your time and effort.
