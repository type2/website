Sounds like a burnt clutch to me. You may try adjusting the cable and see
if if gets better. Most likely it will help some,  but if it's burnt you
will need to pull the motor and replace the clutch. pressure plate,
throwout bearing, and check the flywheel. Good time to replace that rear
main seal too. Good luck.

gang,

matty here. i am having a problem with my 76 westy. it
is grossly lacking in power. this thing is a dog, even
for a bus. the thing is when i shift gears i can hear
the engine race when i hit the throttle but i dont
notice the transfer in my speed. the engine races as i
hit the gas but the vehicle dsoent speed up much. it
seems that transmission is not doing its job. i have
also considered bad compression. but i really dont
know. anyone have any experience with this type of
thing. thanks- matty
