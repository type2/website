Subject: RE: [T2] Battery Terminal accessory tab

Richard,

I just saw one (pack of two) a couple weeks ago stocked at a local boat
store.

I've been looking for this brass ring terminal for the battery terminal:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/Misc/BatteryTab.html

The original AMP terminal had one built in and It let's you quickly  
connect an accessory.

Does anyone know of a vendor that sells this ring terminal? You'd  
think it was pretty common but I can't find it anywhere.

I'm not interested in a replacement cable with the accessory wire  
already attached.
