Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] VOA strikes again

I have owned nothing but VW's (Air and Water cooled) for the last 15 years.
Due to the latest round of harassment by VOA when it came time to replace
the Passat I bought a Honda.  I have to buy another car soon as well.  Doubt
it will be a VW either.  Their actions are hurting them they just don't know
it yet.

&gt; Good ole VW, making more enemies everyday.....
&gt;
&gt; They are selfish jerks these days, I would love to have a conversation
with
&gt; the head honcho, but I'm afraid it would be hard to keep from getting
&gt; physical with him...What ungrateful people they are....
&gt;
&gt; The &quot;People's Car&quot; has turned into a car just like all the others, offered
&gt; by a company with no support tyo those who got them where they are
today...
&gt; I would not own one if it was the last form of transportation, other than
&gt; horseback......

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well Volkwagen of Amercia hit me with a cease and desist  legal
warning
&gt; &gt; this morning. ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hopefully for awhile that will satisfy their need to harass people
trying
&gt; &gt; to keep alive the very vehicles that they show virtually no support for.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Kelly, you know, I think Volkswagen is just wasting their time
chasing
&gt; &gt; all the small-time users of their name.  The truth is that the
Volkswagen
&gt; &gt; name is out of date, what with its 1930's lumpenproletariat overtones.
VW
&gt; &gt; would do much better just to let everyone use their present trademarks
and
&gt; &gt; pick a new name, more in touch with their present corporate identity,
and
&gt; &gt; which no one else would want to use.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How about, say, Philip Morris?  Its present owner doesn't want the name
&gt; &gt; anymore, it has built-in brand recognition, and nobody else will want to
&gt; use
&gt; &gt; it.  And best of all, it fits their new corporate style.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Grant
