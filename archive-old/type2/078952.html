&gt; Hello again all listees, just moved back from Victoria, BC Canada (on the wet west coast) for those who don't know shangri-la to icy Calgary, Alberta (hi Courtney).  I'm badly in need of a block heater for my '76 bus.  I've looked high &amp; low on every website I know (cip1_dot_com, bus depot, etc) and nobody has them.  Not very surprising as how many people drive their busses in the winter?  That is, true winter, Canuk style.

&gt; I've seen magnetic ones at FLAPS which are around 3&quot; wide and 5&quot; long which could mount on the bottom of the engine but I don't know how much heat would actually transmit through to the oil.

I have one that slips into the dipstick,  seems to work reasonably well
especially if the engine is warm when you turn it on.

picked it up at the local FLAPS
