Subject: RE: Good source for Redline MT-90?

Okay, now that we have established the opinions of the group on the use
and value of Redline and Synthetic Oil in the tranny, does anyone have an
answer to the original question: 

Where to get it??

If the answer was given, I missed it in the digest mode, so please forgive
me if this is redundant.

The only person I ever knew who bought Redline got it from a salesman who
showed up at my friends place of work and sold him the product out of his
trunk. No store, no web site, just word of mouth to find the guy.

Thanks much,

John
