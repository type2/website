&gt; I am trying to figure out how to get the gas  heater working on a 1979 
&gt; camper, there is a switch on the dash with temp on it + or - and it pushes in and 
&gt; comes out if you let go. should we hold this or something to get it to run, 

push in and turn clockwise this is a timed preheater

&gt; should we hear the fuel pump run, does the bus have to be running , thanks for any 
&gt; help. the heater is mounted under the bus.

no the engine does not need to be running but the heater draws a lot of
power so wouldn't use it more than 15 minutes without engine runniing
