&gt; There is an excellent oil FAQ at:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/oil-overview.html
&gt;
&gt; That explains the various details of oil very well.  I recommend you read
&gt; it to understand what you are doing and why.

That link has good charts but he does not give the whole story about
multi-viscosity and heat. Go here and read the section on 'Viscosity Index
Improvers' :

http://www.vtr_dot_org/maintain/lubricants-redline.html

And then think about how hot an aircooled engine runs.....
And no matter how much anyone thinks oil has improved over the years, the
polymers in multi grade oil have not changed. A chain is only as strong as its
weakest link.
I have written Castrol repeatedly to get an answer to their slogan: &quot;Engineered
for Greater Protection Against Thermal Breakdown&quot;.
I wanted to know how they got past the 210 degree point and did not have polymer
breakdown. They refused to answer an questions I have asked. But....they did
change the slogan on the front of the bottles!!!!  Now it says: &quot;Engineered for
Greater Protection Against Breakdown&quot;!!  Gee, I wonder what happened to the word
'Thermal'?? But they still left it on the back.....
