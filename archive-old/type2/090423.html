&gt; boy, that sounds familiar. :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. One of the exhaust studs is missing. Local VW FLAPS told me it's an 8x9m
m
&gt; &gt;    stud. He doesn't stock them. I pulled one from a spare 1.8l that I have
&gt; &gt;    and it's 8x8mm, but when I put it in the head it's loose. Would that be
&gt; &gt;    because the hole is stripped or did some heads really come with 8x9mm
&gt; 
&gt; On my 2L the exhaust studs are 8x9. Are you sure that the stud you
&gt; pulled out is still a 8x8? 

Positive. I'm also positive it's way loose. I really don't know any of the
history of the engine from which I pulled it other than what the PO told me.
I guess I'll order a couple 8x9 studs tomorrow and see what happens when they
get here.
