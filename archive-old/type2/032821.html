Subject: Re: An &quot;internal&quot; external oil cooler?

[...]

The last engine we put into our old '68 Campmobile was set up with an
&quot;external&quot; oil cooler mounted over the fan housing air intake, and an oil
filter in the circuit.  The oil filter used a &quot;Ford&quot; cartridge and was
mounted to the engine compartment overhead just inside the upper left corner
of the engine lid opening.  The cooler/filter circuit tapped off the usual
aftermarket adapter that replaces the stock cooler.

This engine was a dead stock 1600 SP, very carefully balanced and
blueprinted.  When we sold the bus the engine had 143,000 miles on it, ran
perfectly, and had ~110 psi compression on all 4 holes.  The engine was out
of the bus once during that period, to deal with a defective #3 exhaust
valve seat.

The cooler, hoses, and filter added a quart of oil capacity to the engine.
We changed the oil [Castrol 30W] and filter every 3,000 miles, and 95% of
the miles were spent cruising I-5 at 60-65 MPH.

I don't know if the engine's good health and longevity were because of the
cooler, the filter, the combined effects of both, or just dumb luck, but I
still wish I'd kept that engine.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt; ...Is it *really* advantageous to put an external filter in-line while
adding the external cooler? &lt;&lt;
