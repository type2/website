Hey   I believe only the campers like my Campmobile came with the original
birch wood headliners and panels. Mine has a birch headdliner, side panels
and even the sliding door has the birch. Also in the rear is a trim piece of
birch where the spare tire would go. It would be easy to deteriorate. I have
only one leak in my bus and it has started staining the birch. I have been
putting furniture polish on mine maybe once every 4 or 5 months, but I don't
know if this is good for it or not. You can see some pics on my website:
http://www.72camper_dot_com/interior1.htm I have made new wooden door panels
too, but covered them in leopard print material. I just took my old
vinyl/cardboard ones and used them as a pattern.
Hope this satisfies your curiousity!!

Subject: [T2] Wooden Headliner Pics?


&gt; There's been alot of discussion about wooden headliners lately and my
&gt; curiosity is piqued. Did these come standard in any busses or are they
&gt; strictly an owner mod? Does anyone know of any website(s) with pics?
Wooden
&gt; door panels seem fairly straight forward but the headliner looks to be
&gt; trickier...especially mounting. There's nothing like the feel of wood,
&gt; though!
&gt;
&gt; TIA

&gt; Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?
