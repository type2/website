Subject: Re: [T2] acid rust removal

&gt; I was using it to remove the rust from the battery trays. I bought some 
&gt; muratic acid from Home Depot in the pool cleaning section. If you can find a 
&gt; smaller container than 1 gallon I would go for that instead. They tend to sell 
&gt; you 2 gallons for about $7 which is a lot of acid.
&gt; 
&gt; I mixed the acid to water (not the other way around!) 1:1 and poured it onto 
&gt; the battery tray and let it steam for about 10 seconds. I then shook some 
&gt; baking soda over it until I saw the acid reaction abate and then used a steel 
&gt; wire brush to break up and remove the rust:
&gt; 
&gt;    A decent mason's yard should have phosphoric acid...This is the basic 
ingredient
in most (if not all) of the rust converters/killers/bullets/etc...A lightly 
rusted steel
can be &quot;treated&quot; with phosphoric acid to convert the iron oxide to iron 
phosphate,
a compound that &quot;shouldn't&quot; continue to rust, especially if cleaned after 
treat-
ment and primed and top coated with decent paint...:-)
 An alternative is a commercial paint store that carries Benjamin Moore 
paints.
Moore has two industrial products that can be used for this...One is (I'm 
told
by the local dealer) a straight phosphoric acid solution and the other is a 
mix-
ture of phosphoric acid and a latex &quot;sealer&quot; to prevent further 
rusting...Follow
the directions...Allow the sealer time to cure, not just dry, before priming 
and
top coating...I'm sure other manufacturers have similar products, you just 
have
to go to a store that specializes in paints and coatings, not just Home 
Depot,
whose product lines are miles wide but only inches deep... :-(
