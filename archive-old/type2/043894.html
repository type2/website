Subject: [T2] Heads, what to do, what to do (SIR vs Steve Sands)

So.

i go to (finally) start finishing up my engine. (1600sp)

Pull out my heads that i had steve sands rebuild (out of the Atlanta
area).  all the exhaust studs are bad, just like when he got them.
Aaaand. The kicker.  one of the instake studs is totally stripped out.  A
new stud just drops in and out of the hole.   (obviously it was like that
when he got them.  I guess I just expected to much to think he would drill
it and put an insirt, or step stud in the hole. 75 bucks a head.  NOPI is
totally out of stock in the exhaust studs, as well.) (oh. and the stem
heights were not all equal, either.)


So, NOPI DOES have a pair of SIR rebuilds on the shelf.   Now, SIR has a
bad rep for not replacing guides...so I was leary.  but, they do always
seem to replace/repair the studs...

So, i grab them.  83 bucks each plus a pair of core heads i had laying
around.


Bring them home, and pull the exhaust valve out of one.  slide it in (no
stem seal, btw) and out, and do a quoick wiggle test... Oooooh.  lots of
side to side slop.

i grab one of Steve's heads.  Pull the exhaust apart (no stem seal), and
vwallah!  no side to side slop that i can feel.

The heads from Steve were not cracked anywhere, and therefor required no
welding....the SIR heads, as expected, are welded between the valves, as
well as a few misc other places. (and some slag that I will need to clean
up if i decide to use them...)


I was /really/ intending to CC these things, check deck height, and set
the CR this weekend, and bolt the longblock together.  finding a shop thta
will do the insert on a saturday is rather unlikely.  I /might/ be able to
find guides and fab a tool to replace them though.   (if i'm real lucky i
might be able to get nopi to pay for th eguides..I mentioned this problem
to them as i was purchasing them..and i've dealt with these guys for
years.)

Just press in/out, yes?  Do the guides need to be reamed, or anything?
What size reamer?  no chance i can pull the guides out of Steves heads and
reuse them in the SIR heads, is there?

what to do...what do do.  any suggestions?  I'd love to get this thing
together this weekend, then next weekend coem up nad drag it all down to
the bus and install it..(campout the weekend after....)

so.  ideas?

thanks...david
