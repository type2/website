&gt; a bus hating mechanic said that i had undersize disc rotors what is 
&gt; the consequence of that?

&gt; does it change my brake pad size?

the term &quot;bus hating&quot; indicates that you should find a different mechanic
before beleiving any information that the mechanic gives.

Undersize rotors are rotors that have been worn to less than the minimum
thickness recommended by VW.  The only solution is replacement.

Still, find a bus-loving mechanic before doing anything drastic.
