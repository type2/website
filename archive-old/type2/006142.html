and dude said......&quot;so the question now is does anyone with some knowledge
on this subject have
&gt;real info and facts to tell me if I need to find some special parts or
&gt;adapters to put my beetle engine in my 72.  will the clutch, press. plate,
t/o
&gt;bearing all work?? it seems to me ( by a simple measurement that it will )
&gt;both use a 200mm plate.  anyways i would appreciate some responses on this
( a
&gt;rebuilt beetle engine can run a fraction of the cost of a type iv
&gt;rebuild)........from some who have done it and how long the are using
&gt;it....reliability, power, cost, time involved etc.&quot;

hey dude....
we have a 1968  microbus that we got for $150 out of a junk yard.....it
didn't have a motor or any interior.  We got a '69 bug motor put in with a
new clutch......The motor (1500) had to be tap and dyed for the
configuration of the Bus motor mounts....the only other thing we have found
so far that needs special attention is the heat exchangers.  The heater
cable mounts for the flaps on the 1500 are on the *inside* of the exchangers
rather than the *outside*.  Stock bus mounts for the heater cable is on the
*outside* of the exchanger......guessing the 1500 bug and 1500 bus had
different heat exchangers....but I am no guru.  hope this helps.

Peace Love and Happiness

PS....It has plenty of power.....(or at least as much as WE need :-})
