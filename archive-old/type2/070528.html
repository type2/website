I have a Haynes manual for 1968-1979, 1600 Transporters that I can give to 
someone that needs it (i.e. has no other manuals). I bought it several years 
ago when I was investigating what type of bus to get. This manual does not 
cover the type IV engine, only type I. Manual is in mint condition, no greasy 
finger marks.

P-mail me if you want the manual.
