Subject: speaker placement suggestions

hey folks,

gonna be upgrading the stereo in the '78 rustfalia and i could use some
suggestions on speaker placement. i already have some speakers i'd like to
use. i have two decent 6X9's, and 4 decent round (mebbe 4 or 5&quot;) speakers.
two of the round speakers had already been mounted in the front door panels
by some po. i was thinking of mounting the 6X9's in the rear hatch panel.
i'm not looking to spend alot. mebbe $300 or so for a stereo and cd changer.
so, any tips?

thanks!

tony
