&gt;Like so many others we made the &quot;too much stuff&quot; mistake also. It's
&gt;a pain to have to move stuff around all the time just to make room.
&gt;The real solution is an adjustment of mind. &gt;


Agreed, I keep a soft bag fully packed for yachting (tou never know when
someone wants crew) and find it gives me all I need for travelling purposes:
Several changes of clothes
'Bathroom' necessities
Something warm to wrap up in at night.

I used it at Christmas time (only one week away in the bus) and have been
using it for the last month as I hotel hop my way around the South Pacific
for work purposes.
