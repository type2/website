Subject: Re: leaking rear wheel.. 67 westy

&gt;The last couple of days I noticed a slight thumping (occasionally) 
&gt;while driving around 40-45 mph.. Tonight while leaving work I noticed 
&gt;a wet  spot on the outside of the rear tire. it was oil... and as I 
&gt;drove home it the thumping noise occurred at greater intervals....

Do not drive your bus again until you check your rear braking system.  
Your reduction boxes won't make thumping noises, but loose brake parts 
will.  Most likely you have broken a brake return spring or parking 
brake cable, but in the worst case scenario you may have blown a 
piston out of a wheel cylinder (which may account for the fluid you 
are seeing on the tire - are you SURE it was gear oil?).  Any of these 
left unattended can cause very bad things to happen to your brake shoes,
drums, backing plates, etc.

I have noticed oil leaking from reduction boxes on buses that have 
been sitting during seasonal changes (wide temperature ranges).

Another source of &quot;thumping&quot; in the rear end can be from the reduction 
boxes not being firmly attached to the spring plates (although this 
usually manifests itself during gear changes in lower gears.

Good luck, I hope this was not an expensive &quot;thumping&quot;.
