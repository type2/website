Subject: 73 Engine Dying

Can't get to the web page/archives and I am desperate. Hate to waste the
bandwidth, but without the archives, I'm flying blind!

Just replaced the main seals on my 73 Westy since they were leaking and put
in a new clutch, since the leak had soaked it). She is now leaking oil
through the seam between the two halves of the engine. Mechanic says he can
pull the engine and properly fix the leak. Or, try to seal it from the
outside, which probably won't hold for very long. The bigger problem is that
the compression is 65, 70, 70, 70 and I'm wondering if I should spend any
more money on this engine. She still runs great, but ... I can't do the work
myself and I need a couple of alternatives as to where to get a new engine.
I already know about GEX from the list (don' do it), mechanic says that he
can get an engine from VOA which will be around $2,000 completely installed
and has a 12-12 warranty anywhere in the US, which, as a middle-aged single
female, I like. However, it will take 3-4 weeks to get the engine. (There
goes Jerome, darn it!)

$2,000 seems like serious bucks for an engine and replacement. Is it?

I am in Tucson. Please pmail your suggestions. TIA.
