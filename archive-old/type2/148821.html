Subject: RE: [T2] oe tail pipe in seattle?

&gt; Any one know where I can find a stock tail pipe for a
&gt; '72-74 muffler in the seattle area?  I see Bow-Wow
&gt; closed shop, it is too bad, they were so close to home.

They still have their lynnwood shop, which isn't too far away.  I just
got a new OE tailpipe (and muffler) from there about a week ago.
