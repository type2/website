I've been reading all these oil FARTs and dealing with Y2&quot;F-in&quot;K all day at
work. FINALLY someone as twisted as I am really made me laugh, IMHO-TGIF.
Have a great Memorial day weekend.

Sorry about the bandwidth but I had to do it...

&gt;If you are going to use any sort of hose jelly make sure the one you use is
&gt;Y2K compliant
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest KY-2K, which allows you to fit 4 digits where there is only
&gt;room for 2 digits.
