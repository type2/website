Subject: Re: under coating on cargo floor

&gt;   I had a thought and I would like to get some opinions on it.
&gt;   I am thinking of putting some of the rubberized undercoating
&gt;   stuff on my cargo floor (after dealing with any rust)

I should point out that the Ziebart guy quoted me $129 to remove all the
old undercoating, treat the rust (with something that looks very much like
POR-15), and apply new undercoating. This sounds like a very nice deal.
Instead of lying under the bus this weekend, scraping away at the
undercarriage and breathing in POR, I'll spend some quality time with my
family.
