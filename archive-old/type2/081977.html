Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

For some information check out:
http://www.birkmamero_dot_de/news.htm
They do T2 to diesel conversions. Pages are in german, but there are some
pics to look at.
They also sell a &quot;HOW-TO&quot;-guide for 60Euros.

&gt; &lt;&lt; OR: you could leave both of your current vehciles
&gt; intact, sell them and go to mexico in search of a used
&gt; diesel bus. More expensive, but a bit simpler.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Would a Mexican or Brazilian bus have the proper/correct
&gt; DOT and EPA equipment and stickers to allow it to be reg-
&gt; istered in the USA? Lots of &quot;grey market&quot; cars have dif-
&gt; iculties getting across the border - Read the customs web
&gt; pages carefully before even attempting this. My only ex-
&gt; prience with &quot;importing&quot; a car was from Canada and luck-
&gt; ily the car was old enough (1962) that it needed nothing
&gt; in the way of certification. The guy in front of me at the
&gt; desk, however, was clearly being told that the vehicle he
&gt; had on a trailer was not going to cross without the cor-
&gt; rect paperwork...YMMV, but do a lot of homework before
&gt; spending your money on a VW that might not come home
&gt; with you.
