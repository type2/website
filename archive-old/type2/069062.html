Subject: The Beam, Part2: The Obtaining

I figure i'll label it part two, and cll the bit about the accual 
breaking part one, and if you mind, oh wel..:)

Anyhow,

Today, Jon C. shows up outside the apartment, at the appointed time of 
8.30. I am sitting in my poor Itchigo having just finished creating an 
area int he mess where i will be able to place my beam later on in the day..

so, we take off out to somewhere , KS, and visit one of his storage areas..
i also have  to help him rip the engine and tranny out of a 
Ghia, push a split about 10 feet, load the enigne and tranny in the 
split, not to mention gawking at the split, and the oval, and the split 
panel, and even the dual cab...and there are more, at other far out stashes!!

to continue...we tore the engine and tranny out of a very rusty partsghia 
that is going to someone else, and it went fairly well, except maybe for 
the CV that refused to let go..

anyhow, loaded them in the bus, then went on to get my new2me beam..

had to unload his collection of 36hp engines from the panel first..
then we sorta shifted the beams from a 56 and someother 50's vintage bug, 
and got mine out...loaded it in the Browniebus, accually a 84 GL, then 
popped the wheeles off this trailer, so he coud get tires pput on them..

oh! did i mention the generator that he and the guy thats ownes the place 
he stores som e stuff built?  its a 36hp engine, attatched to a swingaxle 
tranny, a pully where the clutch should be, a cut mainshaft, then, 
mounted above this was the generator type thing.. and above that , the 
gas tank.

All of this mounted on a VERY lowriding trailer, built just for this 
project..

Jon mumbled something about needing to build a governer for it..

we have it all loaded up, and off we go, back to the city...on the way, 
jon decides that he will buy me lunch, sincei i helped &lt;not much, i 
admit,..&gt; him drop the enigne and pull the tires, and such..so, we stop 
at Rosedales BBQ &lt;i think that was the name..&gt;

then to the apartment, where we unload the beam into Itchigo, and say our 
goodbyes..and i thank him alot, of course..:) 


then i call Dad, and tell him i go tthe beam, and he is already on his 
way here, with a big oil leak from the vavle cover on his poor  N*ssan PU 
&lt;he had to ull it off today to fix a hole, and apparently a strange 
rubber plug in the head fell out wehn he did&gt; so we fixed that..

then we called around and found a tow tolly to tow her out to 
harrisonville, so we have a weathercontrolled environment in my dads 
g-friends garage to work..

tonight, we will finsih loading up ourtools, and put the bus on the 
dolly...and hope that the beam doesnt break farther before we get there!!:(


anyhow, will keep you up2date as best i can.....


....david
