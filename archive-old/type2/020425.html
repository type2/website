&gt; Hello list   The later style  is much better than the early ones.  The TOB  
&gt; clips will fall off.   There are super clips that have an eyelet loop that 
&gt; allowed you to wire the clip to the crosshaft, therefore keeping the TOB in 
&gt; place.

To use the later style you'd have to at least replace the cross shaft 
(plus later clutch components), yes?  Maybe even the whole bell housing.

I found some clips with a loop in my parts drawer and will be using 
them.  From now on I'm wiring things together!  George Lyle also 
suggested wiring the circlip that goes around the cross shaft next to 
the bushing.
