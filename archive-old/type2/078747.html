Subject: Re: [T2] ridge at top of ring travel

I have two other engines (one an original 76) that I will soon be
rebuilding (one of them).  So, even if this one starts to die, I'll just
swap it out with another.  I just need to get this car to pass smog
before the end of the month so I can register it.

&gt;      I am rebuilding my 78' type IV motor now because of a hole in a piston
&gt; and let me give you some advice since thats what this whole list seems to
&gt; be about. You need to look at the rest of that motor. If you have a holed
&gt; piston you probably burnt a valve or dropped a seat. The chunks of that
&gt; piston and valve have probably fallen into the case and have trashed your
&gt; cam and crank. If not I would imagine that there are pieces of aluminum in
&gt; your oil grinding away at the bearings. If you simply replace the piston
&gt; and even the  head and rings you may be wasting money. I thought I could
&gt; get away with a top end rebuild on mine but after seeeing that aluminum in
&gt; the case I discovered the true situation. You have to get all of that
&gt; aluminum out of the case. Its not cheap but nows the time to do it right.
&gt; If you question your abilities I would strongly advise you to speak to Bob
&gt; Donalds at Boston Engine or Jake Raby . These two guys are the top type IV
&gt; gurus in the country and their prices are reasonable. I am putting my motor
&gt; together myself, using all of Bob's advice, and am now realizing that I
&gt; could have saved some money if I would have just bought the longblock from
&gt; him...
&gt;      I didn't mean to ruin your day, just hope to help save future
&gt; aggravation...

&gt; Shouldn't have a ridge that soon but you'll need to bust the glaze and
&gt; install new rings.
&gt; I'd look at the rod bearing from the overheated cylinder to be sure it
&gt; isn't hammered out.
&gt; I've got a single Mahle cylinder and piston if you need it, $40.00,
&gt; $48.00 with rings installed.
