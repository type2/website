Subject: [T2] I need your opinion

Has anyone delt with these guys they are quoting me a really good price on a 
motor. I they also seem really flexible about accepting my core, which is 
not the same as the motor I am buying. The site for the shop looks really
good,   www.garysvw_dot_com Any info on these guys would great.
