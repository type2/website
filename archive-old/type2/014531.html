Good Doktor,

I agree that in purveying one thing and trying to pass off another is,
unethical, and a poor business practise.

But let me ask you this---
Why are you mindlocked on Kraut glass?

PPG,&amp; LOF, for example is some of the finest glass in theUS, and it is
of the highest quality. 

I have PPG glass in all thre of my Deutschlander mobiles and it is
distortion free, fits well, and above all else it is more resonable than
the german glass.

I think that the glass guy is hosing you anyway, because the glass,
installed, in both my GL, and my bus, was only $135.00. installed at my
location----

I'd advise you to let your fingere's do the walking and locate another
glass man. 


Later,

            ______________

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     &quot;In life, it is much better to want
something you cannot have---

Than to have something you can't get rid of&quot;
