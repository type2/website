Subject: Re: [T2] VW Bus overhead A/C instulation manual

[...]

http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; Well I bought somthing today that I couldn't pass up.
&gt; It is a reprint of the 1971 Bus A/C instulation
&gt; instructions. I found a complete A/C system in a bus
&gt; recently that I plan to buy and thought this manual
&gt; would be helpful. I know that the subject of A/C in a
&gt; bus causes some disagreements at times. It seems that
&gt; most people that have actually delt with them in the
&gt; past don't like them and those that have never even
&gt; seen an A/C system in a bus want one. Any how...
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't there a websight that has a library of VW
&gt; manuals? I know that I have come across one somewhere.
&gt; Is it illegal to post one of these manuals online??? I
&gt; just thought that this information may be of some
&gt; value to others and I would like to share it.
