Subject: Fuel tank replacement problem

&gt;Hello all!
&gt;
&gt;I recently replaced the fuel tank on my 81 Vangon.  The tank the dealer gave
&gt;me is actually for later model vans.  Seemed to be the same, until I came to
&gt;the final step, hooking up the line to the fuel pump.  They increased the
&gt;size of the spout coming off the tank, so now it does not match the hose
&gt;going into the fuel pump.  VW used to have an adapter, according to the
&gt;dealer's parts guy, but it looks like they no longer stock it.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone else run into this problem and found a way around it?  Any help
&gt;GREATLY appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance!  Please send email  to:

Thanks again -- I want my &quot;brick&quot; back!  :-(
