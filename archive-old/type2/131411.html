Subject: RE: [T2] quality of rotors and calipers?

I bought a pair of '71-72 calipers from Advance Auto Parts.  They are 
'rebuilds' and I got them 'loaded', which means with the pads and hardware.  
In the set I had handed over to me on the counter, one caliper had two bleed 
screws, and the other had one bleed screw.  I complained and they found 
another to match.  Their supplier was in Phila, I belives. I am in Virginia. 
  I called their supplier and talked them through the process of counting 
the bleed screws and making sure they gave me the needed side.  BTW, don't 
wory about getting the left caliper on the right side, or vice versa.  You 
will pretty well know you screwed up when you try to bolt the calipers on 
the spindle.  It won't work.

The brake pads themselves were of a different style.  One pair of pads had 
the inspection cut down the pad, and the other pair were solid.

I would be careful of these cosmetic disapointments, so check and wait.  
Take your time

I decided to keep the '72 setup instead of converting to the later setup.  I 
was a little tired.  I got calipers and master cylinder from them  Cardone 
is their supplier.
