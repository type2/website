Subject: Re: [T2] further dual carb questions

On my '72, 1700 cc with a dual vacuum distributor (205E, I think),
34-PDSIT 2/3 carbs:

There are connections to each manifold that are connected to each other and
to the vacuum booster.  There is a tube located approximately where you
would imagine putting a fuel injector.  There is a boss there for each
cylinder, but there is only one on each manifold, on the front cylinders, #
1 and #3.  This is clearly the manifold vacuum.  They are big connections,
maybe 1/2&quot; dia.  I think that later buses have a different configuration
here.

The venturi vacuum is on the left only carb and points left, away from the
centerline of the engine.  This goes to the vacuum canister on the
distributor, the vacuum canister port that points away from the centerline
of the distributor.  Vacuum here advances the timing.  This is a small dia.
tube.  Maybe 1/8&quot; id.

There is an additional vacuum that is connected to the throttle body and
that is manifold vacuum.  It is connected to the vacuum canister on the
distributor, the port that points towards the centerline of the distributor.
Vacuum here retards the timing.  This is a slightly larger diameter tube,
maybe .1875&quot;, or so.

Hope that helps.

&gt; 
&gt; I meant to ask this in the last post.  There are three ports I see for
&gt; vacuum.  on the &quot;spider&quot; there is a port in the center.  This has got to
&gt; be &quot;manifold&quot; and is capped.  On the left carb, there are two ports.  on
&gt; comes from the throttle plate, faces the center of the bus and appears to
&gt; be manifold vacuum.  This port is currently capped off.  The second comes
&gt; from the venturi body of the carb, faces away from the center of the bus,
&gt; and is connected to the advance port on the distributor.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; Have I correctly identified the port function for the ported vacuum as the
&gt; upper, outer port on the left carb?
&gt; 
&gt; Neither manifold vacuum port is currently connected. Where should the two
&gt; manifold vacuum ports be connected?
