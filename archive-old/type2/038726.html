Buddy! :-)

Get yourself one of those stepped AKA go/no-go feeler gauge sets. You'll
be glad you did. The .006 will feel a little sticky sliding through.
(How it's really supposed to feel is a matter of debate, though.)

Your oil drip may be from the valve cover. Check the gasket and reseat
the cover, see if that works.

I *think* (I'm not sure, haven't encountered that yet), but it makes
sense to me, that you should be able to replace just the wiper arms.

&gt; I finally settled on using the .006 to set it, then checking to see that
&gt; the .007 feeler would just barely slide through with a lot of pressure
&gt; but the .008 would not go at all.  Any sugestions on this?
&gt; 
&gt; I seem to have developed a
&gt; fairly steady drip of oil (off the bottom tin on the passenger side of
&gt; the crank case)
