Mike, first off, the K&amp;N is a good mod. I've been running one on my ' 78 
westy for a few years.Yes, people on the list will scream that the sky is 
falling when you mention K&amp;N filters, or anything else that isn't at least 30 
years old. Pay them no mind. If they have a problem with my thought process, 
they can find me at HCBF, at the end of July. I'm the 210lb. extensivly 
tatooed guy with Masters in ME, a pristine ' 78 Delux Westy, and an attitude 
problem.( its hard to Always be right.) Secondly, don't drill holes in the 
AFM flap. It'll just give you a &quot;False Air&quot; problem. You can pop the top off 
of said AFM, and loosen the tention spring one notch to let you mixture 
richen up a bit quicker, but you're gonna need a rising rate fuel pressure 
regulator or Bosch injectors with higher flow rate to get any appreciable hp 
gains. Both come with their own set of problems. And the AFM idle CO mixture 
screw you were talking about is just that. It works at idle speed only. You 
can play with it all you want, but at anything over 1200rpm, it becomes 
useless.
