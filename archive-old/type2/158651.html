I would say that the clutch pedal, the accelerator pedal, or the brake  pedal 
are the last things that need to be pushed, stomped or stamped. To save  your 
engine you should turn the key off as soon as it comes on. The light gives  
you a little time to prevent damage. After the bus is off and you are coasting  
to the stop you can hit any pedal you like. I have more customers than I like 
to  mention that have &quot;just went a little more to get to the next convienent 
stop&quot;  that resulted in a replacement engine (or headgaskets on water models). 
They  still didn't make it to that convienent stop and spend much more money 
than they  have or want to. Then the &quot;POS bus&quot; gets blamed for the damage.
