&gt;I know of one company, the Carberator Refactory in Richmond, Califonia,
&gt;that repairs these carbs by enlarging the whole the shaft runs through
&gt;and pressing in a bronze bushing. The shaft then runs through the
&gt;bushing, which is drilled to fit perfectly. I don't have the money to
&gt;buy a rebuilt carb from them, but I was thinking of having the bushing
&gt;put in by a local (Seattle) machine shop, then rebuilding the carb
&gt;myself.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone ever done this? The machine shop I spoke to said that I would
&gt;have to come up with the bushing myself, then they would figure out what
&gt;it would take to put it together.

I had the bushings replaced a few years ago at a local VW repair shop.  I
think it cost like $35 and took about 15 minutes.  They did it in the back
room so I didn't actually see the procedure but it couldn't have been too
tough.
