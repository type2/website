Subject: CR on DP to SP conversion

I am set to go on building the new engine.  I should get the case back
Friday, and upon inspection the machinist said it looked to be in very good
condition.

Anyway, with NEW jugs and heads, do I have to measure the CR? Seems like an
extra job that I could do without right now. (Novice here)

I have a gram scale to check the rods. Should I check the new pistons as
well?

A plug for POR 15 heat resistant brilliant aluminum coating: I found a SP
intake I could blow through and did the acetylene torch then oxygen burn
out. It worked great. Then I sandblasted and put on the coating. It looks
great!

TIA bus friends.
