&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 1st off thanks to those who sent replies regarding earlier 009 diz
&gt; question. Now one more quick one...
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure if I may be looking too hard for problems, but it seems to
&gt; me that the engine is running hotter now than it had been previously
&gt; with the stock vacuum advance dizzy.  Is it possible that the 009 would
&gt; cause the engine to run hotter? 

I stuck a 009 in my bus for a day when I discovered my stock dizzy was
only advancing 5 degrees or so, and it got hotter from 5 minutes of
driving around the block (no windows, doors... it was fast :))
than it ever has with the stock dizzy, even when after going 80 on the
highway. (I cleaned up my old dizzy and stuck it back in, now it
advances past 40 just fine) on the whole fan housing thing, if your fan
housing is hot, you've got a problem. all the cooling air that is
blowing over your engine is blowing through the fan housing, and cooling
it off just like it does the engine. After you turn off the engine hot
air will travel back and heat it, but whith the engine running the fan
housing tells you about as much about the temp of your engine as
touching the front seat.
