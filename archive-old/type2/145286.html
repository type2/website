Subject: fuel sender

Well, ever since I've owned the Bopmobile the gas guage has read 1/2  full when full.  I've been trying to run it out of gas this week  just to see if I could.  But as of last night, the guage doesn't  work at all.  I even filled it full of gas.  Everybody tells  me it's the sender.  
  
  I'm interested in going the way Dan in Seattle went by cutting a hole  above it and putting a bulkhead fitting right above the sender.   As in:
  
  http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Speedway/1974/Y2000/Fuelsndr.htm
  
  Question is, where do I put it in my '76 camper?  I'm not sure  where it would be.  Has anyone done this in a camper?  Any  other suggestions.  I'm still kicking myself for not thinking  about it when I had a clutch put in.  That would have been the  time.  Don't really want to have it dropped again.  Thanks  and cheers...KR
