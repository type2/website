Subject: Steve Dolan is right again.  Was Fuel pump runs and runs

On 2 Mar 1999, Steve Dolan wrote on the list:  &quot;Now, understand that in my
experience *IT'S NEVER THE DOUBLE RELAY*!  I look most everwhere else first.&quot;

He told me the same thing on Sunday, after I'd ordered a new double relay from
Bus Depot, and after putting in my new relay, it looks like Steve is right,
once again.

The problems I've been having were: bus won't start, or starts and dies; fuel
pump runs on after key is out of ignition or doesn't run at all.  10 days ago
I swapped in a different fuel pump and that seemed to make some progress, and
that's when the pump run-on began.

Yesterday, I plugged in the new double relay.  It clicks nice when I turn on
the key, but I get no fuel pump sound, and no fuel pressure when I try to
start the bus.  (at least it doesn't run on anymore, so maybe that was the
double relay?).

I plugged a vacuum guage into the manifold, and when cranking, I get no more
than 5-7 lbs of an erratic needle.  I've replaced all of the 3.5 mm vacuum
hoses and put more hose clamps on the larger hoses.

I replaced the rubber elbow at the Aux. air regulator because the old one was
quite loose and I realized that there was a new one in a bucket under the sink
(thanks, PO).

I checked the compression last night and it is 120 - 125 lbs on all cylinders.

Steve sugggested I check the ground circuits at both the pump / relay, and the
transmission ground strap.  I cleaned both and the bus still wont start,
probabably because no fuel pressure.  My next step is to check for voltage at
the pump itself and replace the wiring, and/or swap out the pump (again).

Any suggestions?
