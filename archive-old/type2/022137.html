Subject: splitting the case
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have rebuilt 2 engines now and this will be my third (a 1600, 1776 and
now 2.0 FI) and have never seen this:
I got the &quot;GD&quot; 2.0 engine from the bone yard (heads missing) for $65 which
seems like a good price.  Anyway, when I got to taking the six main nuts
and bolts off the case I found I had to use a long punch (made out of nice
soft brass) to get out the bolts.  when I got the bolts out there were some
sort of plastic certs on the bolts which is obviously the reason I had to
use the punch.  Do I need to get new ones on these for the rebuild?  What
are they called?  Also,  the front of the case started to split with a
couple of hits from the rubber hammer and the back seem to be a little more
difficult.  Do I need to remove the flywheel for any reason before I split
the case.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated,
Harry
