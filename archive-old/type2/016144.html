Chad,

There are many people on the list who have vast experience with all aspects of
VWs.  They tend to get a little impatient at times.  They forget that at one
time they were novices as well.  Some are just plain purists who don't want to
see anything other than stock.  My personal opinion is that it is OK to do
anything you want to your VW, but maybe you shouldn't do anything that cannot
be undone later.

As for engines, there really is no set correct answer, because driving style,
conditions, locations all are different.  Most people feel as though the 2.0L
type IV motor does not need &quot;souping up&quot;.  I would probably agree.  If you
have a 1.7L type IV motor, consider upgrading to a stock 2.0L.  I think you
will be happy with the results.

I run a 1600 dual port with dual Kadron carbs, and Engle 110 cam, 009
distributor, Berg full flow oil filter kit, Berg single quiet pack exhaust,
slightly ported heads and everything is balanced.  Compression ratio is 7.0:1
and I run premium gasoline.  I believe that I have a very reliable engine, but
I don't drive the dog sh*t out of it either.  I change oil regularly and I
have all the correct tinware in place including the thermostat and flaps.  I
stayed with stock displacement because of parts availability for replacements.
My intention is to be able to drive my bus anywhere in the USA.  If you live
in cooler climates or higher elevation, you might get away with running a
higher compression ratio, but if you want to take your bus to Texas on a
vacation in the summer, you may just burn up an engine.

My advice if you are new to VWs is to read a lot, talk to a lot of people who
drive their busses regularly, not just to shows.  You will learn and be able
to put together an idea of what will work for you.

Good luck,

Rob Dahlgren
