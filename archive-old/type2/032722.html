Victor,

I had my '72 1700 rebuilt 4 months ago and switched from the original
solexes at that time to dual &quot;baby Webers&quot; - 36's.  They are great.  Not a
problem with them. I did think about 40's, but the additional money was too
much.  As I recall they were about $360 from Fast Freddy's in Santa Ana, CA.

Phil

Subject: time for a rebuild | Kadrons?


well, i've decided to have someone just rebuild the 1800 in my '74
westy, rather than put a 2 liter in. the extra cost just didn't seem to
justify the horsepower boost.

but now i'm looking for new carbs, since the single Weber on it just
isn't doing it. I've heard such bad things about the Webers, that I'm
thinking of going with Kadron. I haven't been able to find a good set of
the stock duals.

has anyone had good/bad experiences with the Kadron or Weber dual
replacements? 33/34 or 40's?

thanks,
victor
