Subject: My &quot;busquest&quot;

Thanks to those of you who answered my questions concerning the '79 bus I went to S.C. to see this past week. A few of you  commented that something sounded fishy and it was. First, it was as cheap a new paint job as you could get, with some surface rust painted over to the point that you could scrape off new paint with your fingernail! All gaskets around doors and windows had paint on them(one of the things one of you told me to look for). This guy had tried to &quot;pretty up&quot; a bus that had lots of problems I won't bore you with, but I am curious 'bout one thing. When driving this automatic, when it would shift from 1st to 2nd, there was a loud &quot;thump&quot; that was so severe you could actually feel it. This only happened if you accelerated at a fairly good pace. Any ideas what this indicates?
