&gt;If it can handle turning an AC Pump I bet it can handle an alternator,
&gt;though you'd have to design a mighty funky bracket to do it.

&gt;&gt;It's on the hot side of the tin again, and the belt it uses is thinner
than a standard V-belt like the alternator will probably use.  Other than
that, and the aforementioned bracket fabrication, I'm sure it would work.


Mine was actually out in the open, not inside the engine tin at all. Maybe
it was aftermarket, but they mounted a small pulley between the fan housing
and case and ran a belt (yeah it was thin), to this bracket setup outside
the tin, near the aux battery tray, kinda wedged in there. It probably would
get a lot of air. I'm not going to reuse the AC setup anyway... Anyone need
a beat up compressor? LOL
