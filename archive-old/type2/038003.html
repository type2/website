&gt; &gt; I dont think you could use a chassis punch to cut through the composite
&gt; &gt; layers of the dash without destroying it. they arent sharp and depend on
&gt; &gt; the shearing action to punch. To get it to work on the dash it would have
&gt; &gt; to compress the whole mess hard enough to start cutting into the steel.
&gt; 
&gt; hmmmm, mine is sharp enough to cut me, but I would put the cutter part
&gt; (and mine is designed that way) on the inside and pull through the steel
&gt; first then stop and cut the foam with a knife AFTER the metal hole is
&gt; pulled through... haven't tried it so YMMV

Well, I think that if you do it this way you would really crush/crack the
foam with the larger diameter base part of the punch.  Better to carefully
cut the hole through the foam first and then to punch the hole with the
cutter from the outside.
