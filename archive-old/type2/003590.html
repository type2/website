A few Friday's ago I asked how many of you folks illogically believe in
original
instrumentation and how many of you folks are currently driving your bus in
need of a
repair?  I meant the instrumentation question to be one about
instrumentation not originality, but here are the results:

folks who,
believe aftermarket instrumentation is essential to monitor engine - 33%
would like to add instruments - 44%
have aftermarket instruments - 44%
drive with their ass - 33%
drive in need of a repair - 72%
are original to be original - 22%
have no instruments and are in need of repair - 11%

vehicles responded - 9

I guess the conclusion is that folks drive in need of a repair.

hmmm, interesting?
