Subject: VW shop list updated

I finally got off my duff and input all the shop info I've collected for the 
last few months.  It's in HTML table form, but I also have an Excel file there 
if you want to do your own editing.  

Print it off, stick it in your glovebox with your LiMBO/NEATO TTT directory (if 
you don't know what that is, better join!), maybe print an extra copy for non-
net VW owners in your area.

So here's the link:

http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/vwshops/

If you want to add a shop, here's the link for the form:

http://www.enter_dot_net/~bloss/vw/vwshops/add.html

When adding entries, please try to give complete information.  Consider how 
you'd feel if you were stranded and couldn't give the tow truck driver the 
correct info.
