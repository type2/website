&gt;I've been looking for a post from you for a month!
&gt;
&gt;If you recall...

Sorry I don't. I've been off list several months. Winter and spring were
unusually busy this year and I just can't participate with 20 or more list
items per day. I just hate having to send them all to trash. I have always
been available via p-mail: doktortim_at_rockisland_dot_com 

Just be sure the subject is not preficed with [T2] so I know it's p-mail.

&gt;
&gt;'77 TIV T2 falls on it's face under acceleration.  Final fix?  Fuel
&gt;filter and replace the pump.  

Not a direct quote but the essence of VW scripture per the bible, Bentley,
wherein the first paragraphs of the Fuel system chapter stateth to verify
fuel delivery, umonst other items, BEFORE diagnosing the injection system.
Everything connected to the ECU comes LATER in the procedure. Note the
Ignition system chapter comes before the Fuel system, and opens with
instruction to verify mechanicals, amonst other things, BEFORE diagnosing
the ignition system, and the Engine chapter comes before the Ignition
chapter..........

Get the picture??? The Bentley is organized chapter by chapter in proper
sequence for to find the problem for sure as quickly as possible in most
situations, and not miss something that means you spend one or more
weekends pulling hair with no fix and money wasted on parts not needed.
And the most important portion of each chapter many times is in the first
few paragraphs, with regard to not wasting time/money. The first step in
procedure that you skip means all that follows is based upon assumption
that can rocket your cost per mile into orbit.

Don't hesitate to shoot me a p-mail with any frustrations that might come
to bear upon your Type II, or anything European for that matter. Pokin'
screwdrivers at random is not the same as pokin' screwdrives in proper
sequence. Most on this list are looking for knowledge to overcome the poor
results from doing diagnosis for the things they can do and skipping all
the steps they have not the knowledge, understanding, skill, tools or
equipment to do. Regardless the time and effort required to follow
procedure it will ever be the simplest process to good results.  

Indeed, not problem ruling out very quickly several obvious things.
Verifying spark and fuel delivery takes no more than 2 minutes with simple
tests. (Requires inductive timing light and ether.) Another 20 minutes can
verify at random a good number of other things. If you haven't found your
weaknesses at that point and resolved the issue, start at page 1 of the
bible and follow scripture righteously.
