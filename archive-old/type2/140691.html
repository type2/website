Hi Jules,

    The flaw in the threads may cause a hot spot, although not likely. You
may want to exchange the head, or dress the flaw down with a drimmel.
    The &quot;flashing&quot; is where the seats were pressed in, not to worry about.
    Sodium valves can be indenified by a small &quot;cap&quot; on the end of the stem.
Its about 1/8 of an inch long. Its where the sodium was put in. By the way,
only exhaust valves are sodium filled, its to carry the heat away from the
valve head and combustion chamber. It works like this, the sodium is solid
until heated, when it reaches temp it vaporizes moving to the cooler stem,
where it cools and solidifies again, and starts over.
    Hope this helps.

Howard

&gt; I have a few concerns with this new head.
