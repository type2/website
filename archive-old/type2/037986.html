&gt; I recently had a stereo/tape deck installed in the dash with several
&gt; speakers and a cd changer under the sofa.  They did a great job.  Very
&gt; professional.  Everything looks like it belongs there, sounds great, and is
&gt; guaranteed.

I've seen OK to bad work come out of these shops.  Keep in mind that the
people who are doing the work are not as attached to your car as you, are
under pressure to do the job in minimum time, and aren't worried about
longevity beyond whatever warranty they are offering.  They often take
lots of shortcuts, such as using scotchlock connectors in lieu of proper
soldering and heat-shrunk connections.  Everything will work fine for the
first few months, then corrosion sets in and you start chasing
intermittent problems.

The best jobs I've seen have all been done by owners, even owners who
thought that they lacked the skills needed to do a good install.  Give
this strong consideration before you take your baby to the so-called
&quot;pros&quot;.
