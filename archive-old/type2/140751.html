Subject: Re: [T2] Battery good, radio plays, lights come on, motor won't
  turn  over

----- Original Message ----- 
From: &quot;Anton Ross&quot;

&gt; The 69 Westy we put a new motor in has ALWAYS turned over and fired up  at the first click of the key.

 Tonight, while running out for Chinese it would not.

 Radio works. Lights work. Interior electrics work. Battery is good.

 When I turn the key to turn the motor over, the generator light dims
 slightly, and that is all. No sounds of a starter turing over or
 anything.

 Thoughts? I perused the archives, but didn't find what I needed.

 Starter issue???

Sounds like the infamous 'hot start' problem, although in reality, it is a 'hot NO crank' problem.  Like when 
2 airplanes come real close in the sky and they say it was a 'near miss'. Sorry folks, that was a near HIT!

AND if you look in the www.type2_dot_com library, under H, you will find
it takes you to the Starter section and the 1st one listed is Sean Bartnik's
write-up on the relay.
