Subject: So. Cal. Imports any good??
Message-ID: &lt;376F02D9.493FD192_at_mail.ripon.k12.wi_dot_us&gt;

I was looking in VW Trends I believe it was and saw an ad for So. Cal.
Imports or something to that effect with some great prices!  anyone had
any experience with these guys??

I'm thinking their prices are low because going by the name it seems
they don't specialize in VW....so they have more stuff and can offer
stuff cheaper.... like Wal*Mart can offer stuff cheaper than some little
local outift...you know...quantity...

let me know...
soon
