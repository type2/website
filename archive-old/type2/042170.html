yes you need to drain the oil to remove the filler tube (conversely you
could drain it through the oil filler tube.

&gt; already. Where do I disconnect the wire to the starter?? the Po has a mess 

at the starter, big nut on starter (make sure battery is disconnected)

&gt; of wires and I see that there a bunch of things spliced into the wiring 
&gt; harness. Do I remover the wire right at the starter? Cause I looked and 
&gt; didn't see any way to remove it.

make sure none of the spliced wires are hooked to engine and body or
through any engine tin that will come off with engine.

basically there should be a line at the engine seperation point and no
wires, hoses, or anything else should cross this imaginary line
