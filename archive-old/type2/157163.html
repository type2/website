Subject: Turn signals

Guys, I'm sorry but I just cannot narrow down the
search to find what I need.  I know there is some
information (maybe a webpage) regarding fixing
the turn signal when the whole thing turns
instead of just the switch arm.  I cannot get it
to tighten down on the steering column
effectively and it seems rusty and tight.  I've
cleaned the inside of the turn signal switch and
that solves the problem for a few days.  But it
comes back in a hurry.  Everything I've tried to
use, spray lubes of almost all sort, also make
the thing smoke for a day or two.  I'm obviously
not using the right stuff.  What sort of
cleaner/lube should I use and can I put tune up
grease in there?  How to tighten down the turn
signal to the column without stripping/breaking
it?  

Happy bussin'
Ray
