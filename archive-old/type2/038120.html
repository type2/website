Aside form the auxiliary air valve, I have also found that when crud builds 
up inside the throttle body around the throttle valve, then it will begin to 
stick open a bit after the engine warms up. If you haven't cleaned inside 
the throttle valve housing lately, that may be the answer. You can check 
this out first when it is exhibiting the high idle phenomenon by checking to 
see whether the throttle valve is really closed all the way by rotating the 
lever arm by hand from inside the engine compartment. Of course this is with 
the van in neutral and at rest! The same crud will cause the gas pedal to 
feel stuck closed when first starting up from a cold shutdown.
