Subject: Re: [T2] Ouch - Emergency body repair

If ya don't sand and primer, it will get worse. But do not stop at the 
primer, try to get some touch up paint that closely matches your color, 
primer is very porious and the metal will rust right through the primer. The 
purpose of the primer is to help the paint stick to the metal, it is not a 
sealer (not even a sealer/primer will do, you have to use regular paint). I 
have spots I have repaired many years ago and are still rust free using 
primer and touch-up paint.
