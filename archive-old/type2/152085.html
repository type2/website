&gt; I'll bet your box is rusted out but the pipes within are not. Just peel

&gt; a foundry. They'd prob love to have the aluminum.

I made J tubes for mine from shot heater boxes but exhaust still good and
I'll tell you getting that hunk of heat sink off was by far the hardest
part.   I used a saw and carefully cut it off. don't know how much heat
but the torch I had couldn't melt it.
