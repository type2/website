Hi everyone~
If anyone has time, could you please give me a few pointers on how to adjust 
the valves for my '77 FI bus?  It has the 2000cc motor WITHOUT hydraulic 
lifters.  I have a Haynes manual, but have found the info I've received here 
to be even easier for my non-mechanical-but-learning head!  Thanks again to 
everyone who responded about my previously non-starting bus....dang coils.
Thanks,
Chet Needham
