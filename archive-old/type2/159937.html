Subject: Re: [T2] sliding windows question

Or a more simple answer, no but sliders for a '78 or '79 will obviously.
  FWIW if anyone is looking I feel I have 1-2 sets which if I still do I will
  trade for parts of course for Steve's engine of course.  Steve FWIW had
  an interesting set for the other swap, a set of bay jalouise camper
  windows that had been modified into a Vanagon slider frame set to
  create a Vanagon jalouise window.  An interesting smart conversion
  as I much prefer the jalouise to a slider in a camper any day, though
  for a regular bus the sliders are hard to beat compared to wing vent
  windows.

Would sliding windows from a '90 vanagon fit on a
78?
