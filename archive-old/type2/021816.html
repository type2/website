Subject: Re hydraulic lifter adjustments

I disapprove of allowing any play between the hydraulic lifter piston
and the pushrod tube, since you are then allowing slapping of the piston
against the snapring, and also the valve will not lift as high as it
should.  If oil pressure affects the lifter as it was designed for, it
will function properly whether you have 1/8 turn beyond contact or 2 1/2
turns.   Assuming the piston has 2mm of free play before it hits the
snapring or bottoms out, its ideal position is in the center of its free
play. (or 2 180 degree turns).  The purpose of those advocating less
turning in is the assumption that valve lash will decrease over time as
observed in bug engines (due to seat/valve wear, loosening of case nuts,
&quot;stretching&quot; of a hot case).  Starting small allows for a longer &quot;safe&quot;
period before the piston might bottom out and cause a &quot;solid&quot; lifter to
not let the valve close completely.
    Me, I adjust the lifters about every 25,000 mi to check if anything
has changed drastically- ie, if it takers 3 turns to begin clearance,
something is affecting the valve, such as it stretching, or the seat is
deepening.
