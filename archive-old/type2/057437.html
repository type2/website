Subject: Re: power loss

John S,

I saw your post about the power losses:
&gt;No unusual sounds.
&gt;It still runs, but has no power and seems to get worse the further I go, I
&gt;also think
&gt;its running hot, as in I drove it about a mile last night and the dipstick was
&gt;almost too hot to touch?

I have a 73 with dual carbs that was suffering serious, intermittent
power losses. My problem was related to one of the carbs being set up
with the wrong float level. It was running the bowl dry on one side!

I had a hard time identifying the problem. 
It was independant of conditions and seemed to go away if
I stopped or turned it off a while. My electric fuel pump could keep
up with demand... sometimes. The give-away was that one side of the engine would get hot faster than the other (but it took a while for 
me to understand the symptom)

Maybe this is worth investigating.

Good luck,

Mike Dulany
