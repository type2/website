&gt;Oh well, guess I'll order a new one.  Bus Depot seems to have a really 
&gt;good price on a new Bosch unit (part # 0580463016) for $150.
&gt;
&gt;Bus Boys also has a rebuilt unit (part # 251-906-091X) for $128 + $40 
&gt;core.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have opinions on either of those options?

BD was selling a Pierburg pump (GFP301) at one time but since Bosch is available for the same price you know what I'd get. You can beat the realiability of a new pump. I'd rather hit the junkyard and take my chances than go with rebuilt with the prices so close.

A junkyard pump FI costs $5-10. There are two kinds to look out for:

0 580 463 016 is the original pump and slightly longer than the older 0 580 463 010 pump I've see installed. The 016 pump has a screen inside the intake as a backup for the filter and the 010 pump doesn't.
