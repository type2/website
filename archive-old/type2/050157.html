Subject: re: [T2] Costa Rican VW Scene

hi all,

I concur about the number of VW's in costa rica, its crazy.

We rented a nissan (ugh) and drove all over the country (well at least all
over the north and the peninsula, all the way down to malpais) and we took
a lot of pictures of busses, but had to stop after a while because there
were just so many. Didnt even bother to take bug pictures much as they
arent my thing and they were everywhere.

Funny thing was, in costa rica was the closest i ever came to having a bad
accident with a bus... we were on a more or less one lane road in San
Jose, and were goin about 30 MPH and a 64-75 splitty (they made splittys
till 75 in SA) came barreling the other way accelerating the whole time,
musta been going at least 50 by the time he passed us, we only cleared
each other by inches.  Woulda been ironic to be maimed in a head on with a
bus when i was driving a nissan econobox, given that i have put over 80k
on my busses in the last few years, and i only drive busses.

but it wasnt fated to be that day, thank goodness.

take care,

Steve

p.s. driving an economy car in CR sucks if you get outside the city, a bus
is a great vehicle for down there, hight ground clearance and good
traction. We  beat the he*k out of that sentra driving on the gravel
&quot;roads.&quot;
