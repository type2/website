Subject:  Re: Water based heater in an aircooled

       When I bought my camper in March 97 I new the heat exchangers were
rotted through. Since the vehicle was mainly intended for a summer trip
round mainland Europe in the summer I decided not to worry about the lack
of heating in the van and disconnected the whole system. To stop the
exchangers from rattling about on the exhaust I cut the outer skin off
leaving just the centre core. This arrangement was fine for my continental
European trip, but back in Scotland where you can rely on the weather to be
cold sometimes, even in the summer, I decided to experiment with a heater.
     I have no experience with a fully operational stock VW aircooled
heater but from what I have heard they are not that great. Also to buy all
the bits I needed to get it working again added it up to around 250 UK
pounds. A lot of dosh for something supposedly not that good in the first
place, so I decided to experiment with the idea of a home made water based
heater.
     The water heat exchanger was my first consideration. After a lot of
thinking I made one out of a length on 10mm dia. copper microbore pipe
( about 2m long ) bent into a series of Ss up and down the length of the
cast alloy block which is inside the original air heat exchanger unit. This
block is ribbed so I pushed the 10mm pipe into the Vs on the casting which
are about 9mm wide and therefore squashing the pipe slightly. Maybe 8mm
pipe would have been better. I just wound the pipe from end to end using a
spring type pipe bender on the top side of the heat exchanger casting. My
reason for only doing this on the top was so that I could change the
manifold in future without disturbing my handiwork with the pipe bender. I
held the pipe work in place with a couple of home made brackets which go
right round the unit clamping the whole thing in place. The 'inlet' and
'outlet' ends of the pipe extend foreward away from the heat exchanger and
go through a piece of flat metal bar which is welded to the clamping
brackets to stop the copper pipes from flexing. At a safe distance from the
unit allowing for heat transfer along the copper tube, I reckoned about 8
inches, I joined the rubber tubing  which goes all the way up to the front
on the vehicle. I used standard 0.5 inch car heater hose bought from car
accessory wholesaler who were the only people to stock the lengths
required.
   The water output from the new heat exchanger I put directly into the
input of a salvaged car heater unit which is located at the front of the
vehicle. The output from this goes into an old car type expansion tank.
Inside the tank I put a 12v 'Whale' submersible water pump to circulate the
whole system which it does very nicely. The reason for using a submersible
pump is so that the system is self venting. I tried a piped in/out pump but
it kept on getting air locks around the pump. The electrical power for the
pump is on the same line as the fan blower so that the pump doesn't run all
the time, it only runs when it is needed. When the fan and pump are
switched on any air bubbles or indeed steam around the heat exchanger pipe
work are expelled into the expansion tank and away she goes. The pump I
used is the kind of thing camper vans use for pumping water to a tap. It
isn't ideal as it is fairly light weight in its construction. Maybe a
garden fountain pump or something more substantial would be better, I am
open to suggestions on this one. The pump I am using is however much too
powerful when it gets its full 12V supply so I ran it through an 8 ohm high
wattage resistor which allows it to tick over quite slowly, I think it runs
at about 10% of its max speed.
    In the space above the spare wheel ( this is an '82 remember) there is
a good amount of space and in there I put the water matrix and fan blower.
The air output from this goes into the 100mm oval duct which runs up under
the dashboard. The unit I salvaged from a scraped car has a 'hot cold' flap
which swings between the water matrix side and the outside air and I may in
the future link into the hot cold slider cable on the dashboard.

Improvements I could make are quite simple.

I could lag and insulate the heat exchanger with glass wool and tin foil so
making the water hotter.

I could make a second unit for the other exhaust manifold and double the
temperature of hot water available (theory only).


................I wrote the previous text in January this year and so far
my heater system has worked fine. The only change I have made is to bed in
the copper tube on the manifold with exhaust putty and so improving the
heat transfere to the water in the pipe. The heater performance is good
enough for use in cool evenings and cold autunm days but I doubt it would
cope with minus something conditions. I am going to make another unit for
the other exhaust manifold and join it in with the rest of the system.

My experiments have demonstrated to me that the idea is workable. I would
greatly appreciate any ideas you may have to improve what I have done so
far.

PS. I am off camping for a week in the north of Scotland ( i.e. no
computers up there ) so if there is any mail regarding this I will read it
when I get back.
