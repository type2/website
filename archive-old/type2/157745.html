&gt; hey mike yeah gap is correct i am using a feeler gauge to check it and
then crank and check dwell with multi meter(8cylinder) i get it on 22-23
and then let it go from there... and check it after driving a few miles
and the dwell is changing along with timing each time. i reset them again
with either same points or with a new set each time to check them again
&gt; and again to find them burning up way to fast...

This doesn't sound like burning so much as rapid rubbing block wear.
Causes are rough cam, lack of lubrication, or bad points.  There was a bad
batch of points that came along a while back where the rubbing blocks wore
down very quickly.
