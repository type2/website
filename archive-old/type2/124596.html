Subject: Re: [T2] How Hot is too Hot for Oil Temperature

Muir says it should stay below 225, and 180-220 is ideal (page 369). I've
been told by several air cooled mechanics and long time drivers that with
modern oils, 220 is about where you should start simmering down, and hitting
250 is a big no-no..

Digging into the archives yields a similiar number, of 210 to 220 being a
safe maximum.

I've found in 100+ heat under load, my bus never goes much above 210.  In
optimal early morning/late evening driving, it averages about 180 or so.

&gt;
&gt; Didn't John Muir cover oil temps in his book? Does anyone still read his
&gt; book? (I really can't believe people drive aircooled vw's and don't have a
&gt; copy of John Muir's book with them.)
&gt; I'm remembering that 210:f was a really bad thing for oil temps.
