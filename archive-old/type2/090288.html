Subject: Litchfield CT show pics are up

Hey there Folks,

I've uploaded some pics that I took at the show today. I had to
upload them to Yahoo 'cause my website is &quot;bandwidth challenged&quot;.

I'm still getting used to using a digital camera, so the pics didn't
come out as good as I had hoped. I didn't have the flash on (auto
flash doesn't seem to work well) and it was a cloudy day, which
further darkened the pics. Hopefully I'll have better luck next week
at the NH show. If anyone is interested in getting a highres version
of a pic, let me know.

Here's the link:

Or http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/grnmnstr (click on Litchfield_CT_2002)

A yahoo login is need to view these pics, sorry 8-(

Enjoy,
