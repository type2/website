	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; I'd like to get those new side window seals from Bus Depot but my side
&gt; vent seals are too shot to reuse.  Guess I'm going to put in a couple of
&gt; fixed wide windows and a louvered until these become available.  Were
&gt; sliders made for the 68-79 side windows and are these seals available if I
&gt; find a sliding unit?

Yes they were, in 78-79, and seals are available for $19.95.
