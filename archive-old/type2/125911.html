&gt; Thanks for the links. Drat, my engine is still a 1700... LoL!

&gt; I'd forgotten about the CHT sensor. No sensor, no place for one. I doubt the
&gt; PO would put 1700 heads on a 2.0, though it wouldn't surprise me. ;-)


Don,, Don't be surprized to find the 1700 heads on a 2 liter,,

in fact .. Jake says it is a good thing.  I don't have any experience to say it isn't.

&gt;  An older head such as a 1.7 &quot;Q&quot; head is a great core for a solid
&gt; bus engine. They have stronger chambers and resist cracks better than any
&gt; other head I have seen. Their chambers work well with a dished 2.0 piston
&gt; and they simply need boring to the larger 2.0 register to bolt right on.
