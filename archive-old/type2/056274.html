Subject: Timing Marks for T4 engines

Volks,

It took me the longest time for me to find mine the first time, used as I
was to the big honkin' T1 marks.  The two important things to remember are
that it is on the forward lip of the fan pulley and that it is near the
divot in the fan hub.  If you look at the center of the fan on the T4, you
will see that there is a cutout in the hole in the center.  If you turn
your engine so that the cutout faces the timing scale, then the timing V
will be somewhere on the timing scale, which is how I always find it on a
new bus.  Once you have found it, a dot of white paint will really help in
re-locating it!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
