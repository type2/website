Subject: *SWEET* '69 DeLuxe For Sale/N. Arizona (Cheap, IMHO!)

All,

I'm pleased to inform you all of a great little bus
for sale here in Prescott, Az.(roughly 2 hours NW of
Phoenix)!

It belongs to one of my wife's co-workers by the name
of Melissa (don't let her name or the fact that she
could *easily* be on the cover of Vogue fool
you....she's rebuilt her own type 1 motors in the past
and is no fool around VW's;-)

It's a '69 De Luxe Passenger bus (sorry, no middle
seat) that is in *excellent* un-restored condition.
Factory &quot;powder&quot; blue (still shiny!) body with white
top....only minor surface rust on the rockers behind
the wheel wells....De Luxe trim intact...purportedly
no rust under floor mats...runs strong/well...only one
mild dent.

NOW....I've never seen this bus except for photos (but
they make my (very nice) '69 Westy look second-rate by
comparison! I am also in no way affiliated with the
seller and have nothing to gain by posting this, other
than the fact that I want it to go to a good home.

It's basically been parked for the last 6 months and
has only been started for storage-maintenance purposes
in that time. It will obviously need to be tuned.

The bus has been lovingly cared for/maintained by the
owner and has been an Arizona bus for many, many years
(I.E., no rust;-). It's my understanding that it's
pretty much original (drivetrain, etc.) and it looks
it.

All that for $1,700.00!

I put some photos, along with seller's info, on my
web-site at:
http://www.futureone_dot_com/~jcnkb2/for-sale.html
There are 4 photos, but they were taken in low-lite
conditions and I had to adjust the hue/contrast a bit
to get them looking right on a computer (the photos
are *much* nicer-they're going into my bus stuff
archive;-).

Also, each photo is thumbnailed to a larger
view....*much* larger! Sorry for the load time, but I
just couldn't get the detail any other way.


If any of you are *SERIOUSLY* interested (hey, don't
wanna waste her time, or mine;-), I will go inspect it
and p-mail you the info...

Jaime
