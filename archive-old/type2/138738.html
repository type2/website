&gt; You can find well-built air cooled engines for as little as $1200. Bus
&gt; Depot, an on-line dealer that many of us use, sells AVP rebuilds for
&gt; about that price (busdepot_dot_com). I just looked and didn't see that they
&gt; have vanagon engines, but I was just skimming.

Bus Depot does sell the engines for the air cooled Vanagon. Been working 
slowly toward putting one in my 80 Vanagon. I would recommend you take your 
time changing out the engine for a good quality rebuild. Don't let yourself 
set a deadline to get it done and take care of EVERY detail along the way. 
This should make for a happy bus and driver.
