&gt; I'm planning on getting back into bus ownership after a 23 year abscence!

&gt; thing that made me decide to quit saying I would eventually get another bus, 
&gt; and to go do it. I forsee the list being extremely helpful. Question.. I'm 
&gt; going on a trip next week to look at one that seems promising. It's a '79 
&gt; automatic bus that's been converted to a camper. The owner says that the only 
&gt; repair it needs are new push rods, and depending on my offer, he will have 
&gt; that done for me. Roughly what should a repair like that cost being done at a 
&gt; garage?

This doesn't make sense.  Pushrods seldom fail.  It would only be about
$20 to replace them all, and it could be done in an hour of shop time.

Since this is such a simple repair, it would be to the seller's advantage
to get this fixed himself and have a good-running bus to sell.  Since he
wants to sell the problem to you, I would be suspicious of his 
information.

Considering that '79s have one of the more complex engines, I would insist
that the bus be in good running order before I plunked down my money.  If
it isn't in good running order, consider it to be the same as a bus
without an engine at all.
