Subject: Re: [T2] GEX

I've got to second John here. Jake built an engine for my bug that was not 
only extremely powerful but very reliable, and he's currently building a new 
engine for my bus. I've yet to meet someone in my air-cooled VW travels that 
has any complaints about his work. Yes, it will cost you a little more up 
front, but how much is piece of mind worth? Lots of people say they warranty 
their stuff, but Jake actually stands behind his work 100%.

Bob, I don't know where you're located, but if it's anywhere near the 
southeast, a trip to Jake's is well worth your time. Plus, I believe he 
ships his engines as well.

&gt;I don't know much about Boston Bob, but I know a
&gt;Raby-built engine is one of the best things you can do
&gt;for yourself. I've spent hours at his shop, seen the
&gt;environment in which he builds the engines, and have
&gt;seen the quality of the parts he uses and the work he
&gt;puts into these motors. I've also driven a bunch of
&gt;the different configurations he uses, and he's
&gt;recommended some things to do to my own rebuilds to
&gt;make them better.
&gt;
&gt;A GEX engine is a waste of money. Jake's motors will
&gt;cost you more in the short-run, but if you consider
&gt;that they last a lot longer and perform a lot better,
&gt;that's money well-spent, and a savings in the long
&gt;haul.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've been reading some of the things posted on
&gt; &gt; the list about GEX.  All
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them have been bad comments.  I was looking at
&gt; &gt; there website b/c I need
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new engine for my bus. After what I heard I
&gt; &gt; don't think I will buy from
&gt; &gt; them
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but could someone tell where I could get a good
&gt; &gt; 2 liter from for my 72
&gt; &gt; bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; first you need a core or old motor... check junk
&gt; &gt; yards etc, sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; folks here have blown engines that are basically
&gt; &gt; decent they let go cheap.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; now that you have a core.  check your wallet.  how
&gt; &gt; much work are you
&gt; &gt; &gt; willing or able to do yourself....
&gt; &gt; &gt; figure a two liter rebuild from a decent core will
&gt; &gt; run you at least
&gt; &gt; &gt; $1200-1500 base and go up as you do other jobs or
&gt; &gt; farm out some of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; work.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; to give you an idea, about year and a half ago I
&gt; &gt; rebuilt mine.  cleaned
&gt; &gt; &gt; case. balanced crank. new cam, new pistons and
&gt; &gt; cyl.  all new bearings etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; had the heads cleaned and new seats and valve
&gt; &gt; guides installed. lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt; little things that added up.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; paid to have the bottom end done by a good
&gt; &gt; machinist with VW
&gt; &gt; &gt; experience. did the top end myself..._dot_came up just
&gt; &gt; short of $2,500
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope to get at least 100k miles on this engine
&gt; &gt; before major work needs
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be done again...
