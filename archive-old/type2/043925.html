Mark,

If you want to be really sure about the installation, put them (the
pictures) on a web page or email them directly to me and I will send them
around to confirm that you have installed it properly.

If there are no chips in your cooler, following Dr. Tim's advice will clean
it up perfectly well.

Also, use Loctite Blue #242 on all the screws and especially the fan pulley
bolt.
