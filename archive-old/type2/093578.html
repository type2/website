Subject: Re: [T2] shifter adjustment

Hi Bill,

In second gear the lower part of the gear shift lever should be about 90 degrees to the floor in all directions.

If it still hits the hand brake and the hand brake comes out more than 6 clicks then adjust the hand brake!

good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I just can't get my shifter adjusted right. It's always been to far 
&gt; forward and hits' the e-brake
&gt; handle. I replaced all the bushings last spring except the plastic guide 
&gt; bushing in the middle. I
&gt; did inspect it and it was fine, I regreased everything then also. I 
&gt; played with the
&gt; adjustment a little this summer,but ended up leaving it cause it worked. 
&gt;  How do I get this thing
&gt; adjusted.? Any tips?
&gt;
