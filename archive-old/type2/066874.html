Subject: Where would you go in your VW?

I have enjoyed the variety of responses to this wonderful question.  I had a
lot of difficulty deciding where I would go.  I am keen on route 66 but that
is too &quot;American&quot;.  Baja I like but I've done it. Trans-Canada, brilliant
but I would most like to do the section through the outports of Newfoundland
in our old 73 Safari Camper.

After landing at Port aux Basques I would head north through Stevenville and
Cornerbrook up to Gros Morne National park. After a day or two of walking
the dog I would head up the great northern peninsula to Cooks Harbour and
have fish and fat with a real bayman.

Back on the main route across NFLD I would stop at every pit and sing with
the locals and visit every town with an interesting name. Little Burnt Bay,
Comfort Cove, Twillingate, and Moretons Harbour, all made famous in &quot;Newfy
songs.  A day or two on Fogo Island eating flipper pie then east to
Glovertown and Terra Nova Park.  Hearts Content, Hearts Desire, Hearts
Delight, Dildo, I would have tea at every one.

Finally I would arrive at St Johns, with its &quot;clutter of bright wooden
houses clinging to hills behind the waterfront&quot;.  First stop &quot;The Classic
Cafe&quot; (http://www.pagemaker_dot_com/~classic/ccu2.html) for Toutons or maybe
Scrunchins.

I'm not sure I would ever come back.
