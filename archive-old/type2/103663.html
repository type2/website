Subject: Re: [T2] Buses on very bad roads: fine or foolhardy?

My wife and I recently drove to a hotspring campsite near Mexicali 
where the only other vehicles were 4x4's.  No one could believe I 
made it &quot;up the canyon&quot; in a 72 bus.  A few pictures are below. 
Unfortunately I don't have any pics of the real steep terrain near 
the end of the road.
