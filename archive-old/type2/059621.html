Subject: RE: 79 Westy seatbelts

Roger,

I swapped out my old seatbelts with the ones from JC Whitney 6 years ago
and they work great. Everything bolted right into place -- probably
didn't take more than an hour to do both sides. I didn't find a problem
with the room they took up. The retractor mounted to the floor next to
the seat with the uptake spool to the inside -- between the seat and
wall.

I'm asking for specific comments on any difficulties with the Whitney
belts, or any other&quot;retro&quot; efforts, pitfalls to avoid, etc.  My main
concern is the driver's seat, as the metal retaining wall behind the
seat
confines the amount of available space for the retractor unit.  I've
already checked out (on a rumour!) VW Rabbit belts, which in the 4-dr.
models could work in my bus.... but, being a lazy sod and all, I would
prefer a more &quot;perfect&quot; solution.  Also, ordering from Whitney assures a
new, snug belt, which will fit all sizes of people.  Using a set from a
sedan means losing a certain amount of belt, due to the greater distance
between retractor and wall attachment.
