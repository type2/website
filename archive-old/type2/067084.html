&gt; I have only seen one type of hitch that fits the 69-72 without any

&gt; Look onder the rear of the van at the &quot;frame&quot; where the bumper brackets bolt up.
&gt; They are attached to the bottom of the member. Now look at the side of the
&gt; member directly above the bumper brackets. There are three holes with nuts
&gt; welded inside the frame. In a '72 with type IV engine, they're directly behind
&gt; where the rear engine support bolts to the frame. These are the attachment
&gt; points for the hitch. Brackets are fashioned which basically replace the bumper
&gt; brackets (they have provisions on them for reattaching the bumper) and support a
&gt; box channel that fits inside the rear bumper. Welded in the center is a u-shaped
&gt; piece of steel bar that goes under the bumper and back up to a point about even
&gt; with the middle of the bumper and about 3-4&quot; behind it. The ball was is an
&gt; integral part of the U-shaped bar. This is a real neat setup, as it provides
&gt; additional protection in the event of a rear impact.

I read this, ROTFL, as I spent much of this weekend trying to get one of
these puppies on my '76.  Damn near exactly the hitch described.  After
much pounding swweating and cursing, I did get it installed and, as a
direct result, now have the worlds loudest bus.  OK, if I had entirely
removed the muffler it might be louder, but I must say to all and sundry
that if you have one of those one-piece aftermarket mufflers, there may
be a slight interference problem.  If there is, and you persist, every
engine vibration will be transmitted directly to the body.  It kind of
eliminates the damping effects of the rubber motor mounts to have someting
in direct (or even worse 1/8&quot; spaced) contact with the frame.  OUCH!  That
hitch is coming off after next weekend, so I can hear the radio again.
