Greetings -

Yet another disc brake conversion question... I have a '69 Westy (Wide-5 lug
wheels) that I'm putting '71 (Narrow-5) disc brakes on. I want identical
wheel on all fours.

I &quot;heard&quot; that the narrow-5 pattern on the '71 hubs *could* be the same as a
standard American Chrysler or Ford pattern - 4 1/2&quot; in diameter (4.5&quot; * 25.4
= 114.3mm).

If possible, I'd like to put some nice 16 or 17&quot; wheels on my baby (no name
for her yet) so the 1915-engine / 091-tranny can rest a bit more on the
highway.

I think there's a book around that has the tech data on what wheel patters
go with what cars. Can anybody verify this rumor?

Thanks -

Mike Visket
