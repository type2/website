Subject: model ident needed ??

Dear All -
at a recent garage sale - I found an orange bay-window panel van model made
by majorette of France with the  inscription
&quot;Fourgon VW - No 244 1/60&quot;
it has 3 spoke cyclone-style alloy wheels with &quot;Service Autoroute&quot; (The
French highways dept) painted in blue on each side
Now - can anyone give me any details on it ??
TIA

BTW - Oddly enough - it has a white rear door on it. Original or afterthought
???
