&gt;glass-packs

&gt;bottom clamps eventually vibrate loose and leak.

&gt;    Any suggestions? At this point I'm weighing three options. One;
&gt;throw it all away and buy the damned $150 German stock exhaust.

(!) The Liebstritz (or however you spell it) is $80 at Roy Rogers including
tailpipe and hardware bits. I got the bare muffler from Bus Depot about 18
mos ago for $53 but it might have been on special. Nice one with thick
steel, not Kadron crap. No kidding. Don't patronize shysters.

As far as the leaks, check the archives for &quot;muffler flanges&quot; which several
of us advocate. Six dollars from Kymco plus a bit for gasket material at
the local speed shop. I could almost make two of these for $150 and they
would not leak, no no no. 8)
