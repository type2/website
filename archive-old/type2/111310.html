I really don't believe this is true Daniel. I believe this thought is
simply urban legend. Here is why I can't follow this logic:

1. manufactures (or what i have seen) do not make this recomendation.
they usually only recommend a viscosity.

2. to imply that a brand switch will cause harm might imply that there
are major differences between the brands. however they are all
certified by the same tests, so they must perform similar.

3. I have never heard of a direct relation to a brand change leading
to engine failure (although my exposure is much less than many list
people)

4. If the additive combination in one brand of oil were incompatable
with the additives in another, wouldn't we see some sort of
disclaimer?

Now, all that withstanding, if your dad is gonna change the oil for
you, go ahead &amp; let him. I wouldn't even try to talk him out of it. I
do however believe it's usually not a good idea to change stuff in a
vehicle right before a major trip. Keep things the status quo.
