Subject: Re: [T2] Parking brake indicator lens

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Actually, it was originally red!  The sun kills the color.

I thought my old bus's and beetle's were red.

&gt; The lens is not available separately. It is part of the assembly. Should
be the same as
&gt; a late Super beetle, since it is part # 113 919 233B. I will keep an eye
out for one at the yards.

Thanks.  I might have a line on one.  I'll post here if I pick one up.
