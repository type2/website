&gt; Where did this info come from, that oil temps above 200 F destroy the 
&gt; oil?  I think EVERY car, air-cooled or water-cooled, gets its oil temp. 

I agree with Sean here.  You need to get the oil warm enough to get the
water evaporated out of it.  I used to drive a water cooled VW (the only
mfg to put oil temp gauges in a car) and the oil temp often rose to 100
degrees C.  It ran fine, 150,000 miles when I sold it, in perfect
condition.  

200 degrees F is no problem for oil.
