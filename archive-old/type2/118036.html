Alright Dave heres funny  What are ya a rookie here??? No info at all other 
than a spare tire . no year make or model stock or aftermarket  or whatever.!!! 
Well at least you put your name on the email which is better than a lot of 
people out there!!. I really don't know about the spare strap, has to be on a 
bay window and seeing as I drive splits and vanagons I just don't know, but if 
it is anything like my 64 356C porsche the strap  goes  over the tire and then  
thur the slots on the rim with the hook at the inside of the rim.  Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem Va
