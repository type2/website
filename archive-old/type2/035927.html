Hmm... what made you replace your battery in the first place?

Dan --- Wasn't 1974 the first year for alternators?  And is it possible you
put the battery in (if momentarily) with polarity reversed?  If the battery
polarity is wrong now, your radio will not play...... but at this stage DO
NOT turn on the radio to find out.  The question is: did it play since you
installed the battery?   And are you certain the polarity was never
reversed??  You can smoke the diodes in your alternator within a few
microseconds and then have the symptoms you describe.  If as Dave suggests,
you find current flowing to ground despite all the fuses being pulled, then
have someone check your alternator diodes.
