Subject: grinding in 2nd

Ok. This is probably an easy one but here goes. Sometimes when i shift from 
1st to 2nd (duh!) the gear grinds. Also it sometimes happens when I 
downshift from 3rd. It doesnt happen in any other gears only 2nd. It usually 
wont go into 2nd until I rev the engine or complety slow down and put it in 
1st. Should I be really concerned about this or is it somewhat normal. 
Thanks. Also my bus is a 72 westy with a 1700cc engine
