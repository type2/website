Subject: Re: [T2] dwell vs. good ol feeler gauges

&gt; So I have a fancy snancy point/dwell/tach meter.  Here is my question:

&gt; I adjust the points perfect.  Put it in.  dwell says 35 degrees.  So I'm off

Readjust.  Feeler gauges are fine to get the bus started, the dwell meter
gets it running *right*. if the dwell meter is set to 4-cylinder, your
points are too far apart , if it is set to 8-cylinder, your dwell is 70
degrees and the points are too clsoe together.  either way it is going to
run badly.

Two things... 50 is better than 49 or 51.  48-52 is my minimum standard.
VW says 46 is fine... I say it ain't.  Also, at the end, it's like making
a dry martini... if you see the vermouth go in, you added too much!
Likewise, if you feel the points move, you went too far.

&gt; My dwell-o-meter has a switch called &quot;points&quot;.  Any clue what THAT means?

It is a simple continuity tester. Tells you if the points are (a)
conducting current (b) opening and closing (if you rotate the engien by
hand).  It is pointless (pun intended :) since the dwell meter, by
flopping from 0 to 90 tells you the same thing.  BTW, on a T1, you can
static time with the dwell meter... look for the dwell to flip from 0 to
90 (or is that 90 to 0?)
