Subject: Re: [T2] 96mm piston upgrade

When  doing a lot of building on type 1 engines I learned to shy away 
from any &quot;slip in&quot; cylinder upgrades.  They do not last long and can 
cause severe damage the rest of the engine when they start warping.  
Always start from scratch with a machined case to take a &quot;correctly 
designed&quot; jug.  I never had a problem of any kind with jugs that were 
machined in and heads machined to properly match.
