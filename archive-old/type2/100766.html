Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

This seems like allot of effort to get a little brighter light. I am not
convinced that the line lose and the switch connection would be sufficient
enough to really make a difference. I could be mistaken. I must confess that
I am not a fan of these kind of modifications. Which usually only add insult
to injury and support the production of cheesy gadgets that we could all us
less of in our lives. Low light output is relative. A new German sports car
has bright lights that cut into the dark like the sharp end of its
aerodynamic nose both to aid and promote fast speeds. Bus lights are full
and subtle like it's rounded protrusion which forges it way through the cool
night air. Love and appreciate your bus for what it is and why it is that
way. Perhaps even, your bus is trying to tell you something...need a new
windshield?...maybe you need glasses?....maybe you shouldn't stay out so
late?......is it past your bed time?.....

Seriously, check all your connections and wiring to make sure they are not
worn out. Check your battery, generator/ alternator, and voltage regulator.
Then if it's still not enough you can always upgrade from a 30-38amp gen or
even the alt conv or from a 55-70amp alt on later buses.
