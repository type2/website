Subject: WTD: Steering Box??

Im going to need a steering box for my 68. 68-72 is the same I think.
Anyway if youve seen the cost of a rebuilt you know why Im looking. Id
really like to find a used one in functional shape. Im kind of pissed at
myself for not saving the bad box from the 69 that I gave away, I would
have liked to take a crack at it anyhoo.
Oh well. 
TIA.
