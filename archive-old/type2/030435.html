Ok.  Odd things.;)

Stock 1600sp, ya de ya.  A few single vac distributors (one original
to the 66, one correct for a 69, the other sits on a shelf.;)

Its ichigo's engine in the 66, soo...

When I first put it in, I put it in with the 30/31 that I got working well
on ichigo.  Had to pull the idle solinoid and put a plug in there, due to
it not triggering well on  6v...;p ( and as far as I can find, no 6v ones
that fit that hole..)

So.  Got her running, etc.  Decided to try putting the 66's original carb
and distributor on.

original 30pict1, with disabled (broken parts inside..then gutted and
locked open) governer. Original distributor, too.

Pulled the gov off, and the long stucds, since I didnt need it on, yadeya.

Stuck it and the distr on.  Went to time it...whoa!  at idle, advance was
3/4 of the way up!!! (pull the vac line and plug, it droped back down near
0, like it should...)  Full advance was only a few more degrees on. (never
went past 30, where I keep it...)

Odd, says I.  Put ichi's distr in.  Same result.  Funky.

Swap back to the 30/31, and all back to normal. odd.

this was a few months ago.  I attributed the difference to overall
manifold length differences, owning to the lack of governer.

zoom on to today.

Pulled the 30/31 (without idle cutoff, so it runs on...) and installed the
30pict1 with gov. 

Guess what?  Same result.  3/4 of advance at idle. pull the line a block,
drops back to near 0 like it should.

Now, on the original engine in the 66, (0 on 3..) which ran fine with this
carb (well, rough, but thats forgivable...;), I didnt notice this problem.

Timed like usual, etc. 

anyone have any sugestions as to why the hell this is happening?  i'd like
to be able to have a idle cutoff again.;)

thanks...david
