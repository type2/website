Ron, all very nice. But you run a business, and the business has a bottom
line. If you weren't a reasonably efficient capitalist, you wouldn't be in
business.
So, I know that you &quot;get&quot; this part. You must make money or you won't have a
business for long.
As to anything extra that you do to make someone smile or whenever you go
the extra mile for a customer or even a total stranger that you know you'll
never see again, don't tell me that you don't get anything out of it. You do
what you need to do to get by, even if that means being able to live with
yourself or feel like you've got some right to call yourself a human being.
Obviously, that means something to you, and as valuable as it is, money
can't buy it and it can't be sold.
Ayn Rand referred to this as something called &quot;enlightened self interest&quot;.
It refers to things like not peeing in the pool you swim in, not cheating
your business associates, etc.
Being strictly self-interested might seem on the face of it to be a very
selfish and unsharing, uncaring thing. It isn't. It's just taking care of
yourself and your loved ones and priorities, but those priorities can be
very enlightened and generative. Taking the time to offer advice to
newcomers who want to keep their busses running is exactly such a situation.
By supporting a community of fellow enthusiasts, you are creating a
community that will support you and each other. That's what a community is
all about. There are lots of benefits involved in being part of a community,
one of which is just feeling good about yourself and having someone to share
some good vibes with. Money can't buy that, and it can't be sold, but it
does have a very certain and considerable value. It can and does eventually
create a financial benefit in most cases.
So, you would qualify as a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot;. You tend to believe
that what goes around, comes around, and that you don't have to make a buck
every time you take time for someone. I had a small business at one point..
my first one.. but not my last. I got burned pretty badly overall, and a
good part of it is my fault.. inexperience and naivety and other things.
Part of the problem could be chalked up to &quot;society&quot;, because people can be
very selfish even without thinking about it and they can really take
advantage.
Society also has some pretty foolish notions that have been fed to it via
the kind of leftist propaganda that is so prevalent in the media these
days.. there are political reasons for this and it serves the truly selfish
interests of others in many ways, but they are usually hidden. For example,
Be a bit careful when someone says that they are doing something &quot;for the
children&quot;. LOL. Too often the children are just a ruse, a ploy. There might
be an Aesop's fable that fits this situation, maybe The Fox and the Crow.
At any rate, I offer my apologies for MY rant, but I will rant whenever
someone gets on what amounts to an anti-capitalist rant and knocks the
profit motive. The profit motive is 100% legitimate and anything to suggest
that it isn't is potentially dangerous counter-culture. I had to learn this
the hard way. It's real important to do what you think is right and to be
socially responsible, and you naturally want other people to think well of
you and to be comfortable with your integrity and motivations, but you will
be one sorry sucker if you allow the politically correct crowd tell you how
to run your business. Ask me how I know. Let's put it this way.. I won't
make that mistake twice.
