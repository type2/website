&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Why is the bus clutch cable end and clevis pin link seemingly poorly
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; designed? Seems like a common point of failure. Anyone beefed up the
&amp;gt; &amp;gt; cable to clevis pin connection?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; The original (black in my photo) allows the pin to rotate:

Even with a rotating pin something has to wear.  Ideally, it will be the
cheapest part (the pin) that can be replaced easily.  My experience is
that the cable will tend to wear first but after a few cables wear out the
arm will need to be welded up and redrilled.

Our buses have far outlasted their original design life.

It would be very nice to put a small needle bearing in there to eliminate
this problem forever.
