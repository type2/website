Subject: RELAYS (dual battery or Starter)

A simple relay is just a switch operated by a solenoid coil instead of
your finger!  I can check a relay with just a continuity tester or
ohmeter to see what's being switched when the electromagnet closes.  The
coil has 2 contacts to operate a central electromagnet - thus they need
a ground source and a + source coming from your ignition switch- ie for
a starter, it's that red wire hooked in at the top of the starter
solenoid.   That wire gets too much resistance to pass enough current to
kick the solenoid, so what you want to do is feed direct battery current
to that contact.  You can lie under the car and do this with a jumper
wire (been there) or use the relay to do it- The relay must have 2 other
contacts that will achieve this.  If it seems to have only one wire for
the coil, then the housing you screw down may be the (_) ground when
bolted to any metal wall.  
     You can usually figure out the switched side by looking for what
the magnet pulls on- usually a plate with contacts on it that close when
it pulls down- those contacts close the feed between the battery and the
solenoid.  Thus you remove that red wire from the ignition and feed it
to the relay coil (grounded), attach one switch side to the battery
terminal (lowest starter solenoid terminal), and the other switch side
to the upper terminal your ignition originally went to.
   For an isolator relay, same principles apply- it has a ground wire as
I recall that you screw to the wall by the parking light housing- and a
(+) wire fed by running it to the (+) on your coil.  Since you are
switching it into your primary battery, you need a heavy wire from that
battery (+) to one switched terminal on the relay, and the other goes to
the (+) on the spare. Voila- when ignition comes on, it closes and
allows both batteries to be in parallel.
Thus, you screw own the
