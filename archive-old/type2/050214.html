Subject: [T2] Oil pressure problem
Content-Disposition: Inline

Hi- I'm new to the list and couldn't find my problem in the library, so
if it's been hashed over before I owe you one.
Anyways, I've got a newly built 1776 that has low oil pressure after it
warms up.  I noticed the light flickering after it had been running for
a few minutes, so I hooked up a manual gauge.  REALLY low pressure!  I
changed out the plugs under the motor- still low.  Changed oil- still
low. Now, here's the monkey wrench:  I was planning on using an external
oil filter, so I drilled out the plug on the motor for the fitting.
Couldn't figure out how the pulley went over the fitting, so I plugged
the hole and opened the oil pump back up to use the stock system.  Then
I was looking at an ad in a VW mag and noticed that they showed the
fitting in a different hole!  I had used the one behind the pulley that
sticks out the farthest- like my diagram (?) said.  Did I drill the
wrong plug out?  If so, would this affect the oil pressure even though
it had been plugged back up?  Hope someone has an answer, I'm running
out fast!  Thanks-

-Pat
Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most.
