Subject: Re: [T2] Some questions.

&gt; Oh, jubilant exhultations! I have finally succeeded in a virtual diagnosis
&gt; of a real VW problem. Remember, I thought the timing might be 180* out.
Yay!
&gt; Glad you got it fixed! Was this a new Mexican engine? Just curious...

Originally it was timed one tooth off. I ended up having to remove the drive
shaft and replacing it. As far as the timing still being off, I certainly
hope not considering that factory timing is 5 ATDC and its there exactly.
Dwell is at 50.

No this is an issue somewhere with fuel. I think I might have a partially
plugged jet or an accel pump that that is leaking.  Anyone else with any
suggestions?
