Please excuse that this is a real newbie question, but I need some good
advise.  I bought a 1968 crew cab 2 weeks ago in California which arrived here
in Texas on Tuesday.  I checked out the vehicle including the engine except
for compression test using John Muir's list.  Everything seemed OK.  The motor
ran a little rough and a little hot to the touch.  I been planning to teach my
about the engine a little at a time.  Meanwhile I have an appointment with my
small town's only really good VW mechanic for the 20th. to check it out and
give it a tune-up. (He's booked up further ahead than a doctor)

Thursday night my son was on the way home in it.  About 3 miles out the left
red light came on, and he heard a &quot;clunking noise like metal on metal&quot; coming
from the engine.  He did not stop but drove the rest of the way home.  (I've
had a discussion with him on this)  I've been reading John Muir's discussion
of &quot;expensive noises&quot;.  He also says that little noises can quickly become a
thrown rod or a busted crankcase.  The oil level is fine.  I haven't figured
out how to get to the front of the shroud to see if anything's caught in the
fan housing.  I have determined the belt is loose.

Question 1 - I'm tempted to start it to hear it myself, but I don't want to
make it worse.  Anyway I probably wouldn't be able to fix it myself anyway and
might have to disassemble the engine, which is beyond me now.  Should I start
it, or it that guaranteed to make it worse?

Question 2 - Should I tow it to the mechanic or drive it gently?  How do I
tell a little noise I can get by with for a few miles versus a don't start the
engine for any reason noise?
