&gt; &gt; Hard to beat new.  I've got a lot of miles on mine and I'm satisfied.
&gt;
&gt; What are you up to now mileage-wise, George?
&gt;
&gt; Also, did you re-torque the heads or have you reset the endplay at any
&gt; point?

About 50K.  Only mishap was one broken cylinder stud, but I haven't heard
of this being a common problem.  I haven't retorqued or reset endplay.
Just kick the tires and light the fires!  Adjust valves every 2K, but it's
unusual when more than one of them needs adjustment.
