Subject: RE: [T2] RE: New heads for 1600

&lt;&lt;They are genuine VW/Brazil bare heads with German components installed&gt;&gt;

&gt; Does this mean they are complete ready to install? Or not?


Sorry, my phrasing may have been confusing. These are complete heads with
valves and all, ready to install.  The bare heads are from
Volkswagen/Brazil, but are then fully assembled with German made components.
Again, dual port, $99.95 each.
