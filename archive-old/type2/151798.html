Subject: Now: oil sources..was  [T2] Engine conversion 

Ray,

On a side note, do you read the Sunday paper?

Do you read the &quot;Parade&quot; or whatever magazine they include in it that has 
Marilyn vos Savant answering questions?

See the one last Sunday?  The question was 

&quot;who do we import the *most* oil from?
A. Saudi Arabia
B. Kuwait
C. Iraq
D. Canada


aahhhh to cut the story short, the answer is *****Canada*****.

And what's more, it has been forthe last **seven** years in a row.

So what do I hear this morning on NPR?
Canada's currency value has gone up 40% in the last year or two and is now 
a *hot* commodity in the money market since their money is now known
as a &quot;petrodollar&quot;.

On the same NPR show this morning, it was revealed that the &quot;tar sands&quot; of 
Canada has ***more*** oil available in it than all of the Saudi oil 
fields.

Bus Content: I love you Canadian guys, man!  I love burning Canadian oil
		in my bus!  LOL!


So, the big question....why is the regular media always harping on opec?
I won't ask the other rhetorical questions about why we are in certain 
places...I leave those questions up to the reader&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave
