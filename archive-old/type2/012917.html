Common, don't fill it all the way 8-)

Seriously.  3-4 possibilities.  The rubber filler neck, not sure what you
guys got there, if same as US it used to be about $20 but was
unavailable for a while, now back I think.

Rubber elbow (about 52mm?) down from fill tube to the tank, this
is a PITA as it often goes, is often the problem if it was really pouring
the gas, and is NLA in the US at least.  You have to find a BUNA-N
(BUNA-NITRILE) rubber replacement, MUST BE BUNA-N to resist
gas or urethane I guess but no unknown rubber.  The PITA here is
that the thing is formed with like a 15-20 degree bend over a short
12-15cm length.  Straight hose you might find is a real pain to
get to fit and bend well, but it does work if it doesn't have much
reinforcement (the stuff often has spiral wire in that size.)

Vents off the tank, US tank has one on each side that connect
to steel lines that eventually go up the rear pillars.  They connect
to the tank with slipped on 6-7mm hose, no clamps.  22 year old
hose cracks.

Vents up in the pillars, same system up where it goes to the gravity
check valves, some years there is a hose connection up there as well.

Ok the filler neck you inspect through the filler itself or by pulling the
black acess plug on the right inner fender and looking.  You may
be able to feel and inspect the big elbox there as well.  The vent
lines to the tank require pulling the firewal, which on your carb engine
may not be so bad.  You CAN do it engine in car.  You destroy the
firewall less if you loosen the engine bearer and trans bearer and let
the engine drop an inch or so on a jack.  There are 3-4 screw down
each side of the firewall AND of course the two hidden screw up into
the firewall from below.  The vent lines in the pillars if present you
got to just feel for.  Best to look to the stuff you can get to first and
hope for the best then weight the safety matters in your head.
