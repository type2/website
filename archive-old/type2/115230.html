Subject: Re: [T2] the mechanic's full notes on Alice (Vacuum Sytem
  Rebuild)

Hey-
You are hopefully on the playa right now, but I have an idea for you for
when you return:

I chased a similar gremlin on my '73. She acted like there was a major
vacuum leak, but I was unable to find it. I replaced boots, clamped hoses,
sprayed various flammable substances around the engine bay, ect, ect, ect.
It was very disheartening.

The solution was to simply buy about 20ft of appropriate sized vacuum hose,
and replace the vacuum system as a whole from the carbs to the brake
booster. I eliminated the boots (which still give me trouble on my '74), and
clamped the hose directly to the nipples on the carbs. I eliminated the
stainless steel tube the runs along the firewall by attaching the new hose
up fairly high on the firewall, and using a brass &quot;T&quot; to carry the vacuum
through the fire wall (to prevent chafe). It did require a few fittings to
match the different nipple sizes, but was simple and inexpensive.

The result: She purrrrs like a kitten, and the brakes work much better. Hope
this helps.

Cheers,
Matthew
