Hello All:

I recently bought a pair of rubber grommets for the clutch and brake pedals.  These are the ones that fit in the holes in the floorboard where the pedal shafts go through.  I can't find a picture of how these things fit, so the question is:  does the concave side of the grommets go up or down??

Thanks!
