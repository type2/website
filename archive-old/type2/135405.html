Subject: Re: [T2] late bay taillight assembly?

&lt;IBTD.  All Euro Buses since they've had turnblinkers at all
have amber rear turnblinkers.  (Front too, except in Italy
where they used to be white even on early model Bays.  
Possibly more such obscure countries ;-) had other front
turnblinkers too, but about Italy I know for a fact.)&gt;

I'll second the Italy statement. I had a Beetle when I lived there and all of the cars from the 70's with Italian spec lighting were like this to the best of my memory...
