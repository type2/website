Subject: pulley and crank spacing

Saturday I reached the end of another long rebuild saga. In September, I
removed the 1776 from my Westy. Took me five months of occasional work to
rebuild it. Saturday it started and ran on my test stand. Wouldn't idle,
but I'm sure that is timing.

One disturbing feature was that after  five minutes, the front of the
pulley began scraping against the tin on the left side. I poked, I pushed,
I bent as best I could and finally I removed the pulley and completely
reshaped the piece of tin that bolts in front of the pulley.  The gap is
much better now and I'm sure there won't be any scraping.

My question is this: Did removing and replacing the pulley  alter the 0.003
gap I established for my crankshaft way back when I shimmed it?  My
understanding of the inner workings says no. I'm hoping this is correct.

Can anyone shed light on this?

Jack
