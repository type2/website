Subject: Re: [T2] Exterior door mirror question

Sounds like the window replacement procedure.

Thanks. I'll give it a ponder if not a try...

This mirror is probably not an original, as it had the plastic edge molding
&gt;between the mirror glass and the chrome metal housing.  For whatever reason
&gt;(probably exposure to UV), the plastic edge molding when south and the
&gt;mirror glass fell out of the housing.  After obtaining a new piece of mirror
&gt;glass, cut to shape, from my local glass guy, I cut a length of plastic
&gt;tubing........
