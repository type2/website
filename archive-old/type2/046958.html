Actually I am a classical music aficionado, and I don't think that annoying the neighbours is in my gameplan. The bous from the 'hood would probably run the other way if they heard classical music!!

&gt; Considering that a &quot;nice&quot; stereo system goes for $900.00 to $1,200......

I know that you can spend that much, but in a vehicle such as a bus there
is little point unless you want simply to annoy the neighbors or impress
your friends in the 'hood!

I think that you can do a fine stereo system for around $500 if you stay
away from the &quot;high end&quot; room.
