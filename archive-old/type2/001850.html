I believe that section of the Bentley (section 3, page 4) pertains to 68-73
or 74 buses. There is no way I could
ever fit 15+ in my 77 unless I had a massive leak or the pump was ripping me
off!
The most I ever put in when I coasted on fumes was 14.7 gallons. According
to the back page of my 77 owners manual:
Fuel tank capacity = 14.6 US gal/12 imp gal/ 55 liters

&gt; &gt; At 04:08 PM 03/31/2001 -0500, you wrote:
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) What is the fuel capacity for the '74 - '79 bus? 15 gallons?
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) What PSI is the windsheild washer bottle supposed to be at?
&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) How much fuel does the RESERVE hold? (mine seems to last forever!!)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All that is in the owner's manual and not the Bentley. Anyone got an
&gt; &gt; owner's manual and can look it up??
&gt;
&gt; From the Bentley:
&gt;
&gt; 3.1 Fuel System, General Description...The fuel capacity is 15.8 US
gallons
&gt; (13.2 Imperial gallons; 60 liters).
&gt;
&gt; 9.5.5 Lubrication and Maintenance, Checking Windshield Wipers and
Washers...
&gt; The air pressure should be maintained at 42 psi (3.0 kg/cm2)
&gt;
&gt; As far as I can tell, there's no reserve tank (which would require a valve
&gt; to switch from the main tank to the reserve tank) on a Loaf bus, just a
line
&gt; on the gas gauge.
