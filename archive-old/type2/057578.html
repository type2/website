Breakfast:  8:15am at Denny's in front of the Seatac mall.  Just take the I5
exit to Seatac mall...

Ask fo the &quot;VW group&quot; when you go into Denny's.  Not my favorite choice of
eating establishments, but it will be a good place to gather.

Hope to meet many on Sunday!

&gt;
&gt; VW Show in Western Washington.
&gt; Sunday -- August 23.  Show runs 9:00am to 2:00pm.  Oval's Motorsports,
&gt; Federal Way, Washington.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the advertisement they ran in the paper:  &quot;&quot;Free Volkswagen car
&gt; show &amp; swap meet. Oval's Motorsport, Sunday, August 23, 9am-2pm. (253)
&gt; 874-8290&quot;&quot;  Their address is 1620 S. 341st Place, Federal Way.
&gt;
&gt; This is the 7th or 8th year that Oval's has had the show... but they
&gt; haven't done the best job publicizing it.  Not a big show, but FREE and in
&gt; a great VW town.  Oval's is also one of the best VW FLAPS I have
&gt; encountered in the area... great to have a chance to shop their store on
&gt; Sunday.  In past years they do 10% store-wide for the show...
&gt;
&gt; Listee Breakfast:  A few of us plan to meet near Seatac mall at 8:15am /
&gt; 8:30am for breakfast.  P-mail me if you are interested.
&gt;
&gt; Federal Way is right off of I5 about 1/2 way between Seattle and Tacoma.
&gt; You take the Seatac mall exit.
&gt;
&gt; Not affiliated, just a fan of Oval's and wanting to catch-up with some
&gt; listees.
