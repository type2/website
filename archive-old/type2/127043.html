Subject: Stupid 1600 exhaust gasket question

Feeling pretty dumb, but it's been awhile since I
had a 1600.  I removed the super cherry bomb
exhaust that was on it and installed a stock
muffler.  What kind of gasket goes between the
muffler (the part that the heater hoses connect
to) and the heater boxes?  Same gaskets as the
lower connection between the heater box and
muffler or something different?  

Please reply directly also as I read in digest
mode.  

Thanks,
Ray
