Hello Again!

&lt;&lt;Going with longer studs is one way to solve the problem, but the easy
way is to get the right lug nuts.&gt;&gt;

     So does anyone on the list have any spare lug nuts, or longer studs
lying around they would like to sell? I don't have any junk yards around
that has any Vanagons for parts. the nearest dealer is 50 miles away.
Thanks for all the great help everyone!!

Thanks,
