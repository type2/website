&gt; 
&gt; WELL....10 MEGS is a lot, when used properly. It gives
&gt; you the chance for a *LOT* of photos as well as a
&gt; *LOT* *MORE* script. At least for a personal web-page.
&gt; 
&gt; NOW.....If we all had our personal web-pages and
&gt; devoted the &quot;memory&quot; space wisely....
&gt; 
&gt; We could conceivably negate the TypeII Archive
&gt; altogether. It would be replaced by individual
&gt; web-pages spotlighting what we've done for our busses
&gt; as individuals.
&gt; 
&gt; That would free-up a LOT of band-width for Type-II. It
&gt; could make this list move more smoothly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well...what do you all think?

AFAIK, the type2 website resides on its own machine, so we are not
really space-limited by anything but our hard-drive size.

One problem with individual sites is that they tend to come and go. 
Often I have gone in search of some tidbit of info to find that the
site I bookmarked no longer exists.  The information is valuable, but
for one reason or another it has not been maintained.  Better, IMO, to
put the information in one or two sites where it will be backed up and
be more or less under the control of the listmembers.

For those who choose to place their information on their own sites,
The links through the Type 2 Library allow them to be included in the
database while maintaining close control over their works.
