Subject: Re: [T2] compression check

Lower... tolerances aren't as tight and the oil isn't flowing to help 
with the seal.  My friend tried checking the compression on his cold 
mitsubishi eclipse.. 125, 85, 25, 25... we were stumped - thought the 
car was dead - (it was blowing smoke).  Then we started it, ran it for a 
little.. 185, 185, 185, 185..

turns out the turbo seal on the exhaust side went out.. actually, the 
entire impeller blew up..

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that I should do a compression check on a warm engine, but . . .
&gt; 
&gt; will the compression reading on a cold engine be, genrerally, higher or 
&gt; lower than on a warm engine.
