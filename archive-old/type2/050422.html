Subject: [T2] Value of a 1968 Single Cab

Hello all!

I am new to the list, just adding this in addition to the Vanagon list.  I
currently own an 84 Vanagon and going back to my roots by buying an
air-cooled.  I am currently looking at a 1968 Single Cab, that has been a
daily driver for a guy since he purchased it in 1987.  However, by daily
driver, he only drives about 8000 miles a year.  It seems to be in decent
shape, typical rust problem with rust by the battery and some underneath.
Interior is in decent shape, body is fairly straight.

What is something like this worth?  My goal would be to fix it up to nice
condition (but not a restoration), and enjoy driving it around.  

I live in Colorado.

Input greatly appreciated!

Thanx!

Z

Hmmmm,

Tie a cat to the bus. One in the engine room too. 

In all seriousness, check things out before you drive it. Jennifer smoked
the motor in her '65 when some mice took up residence in her engine tin. Air
did not flow, motor overheated, mice toasted - what a mess. This occurred
while the bus was being driven regularly.

Shortly after getting my '67 bus I pulled the motor out for some odd and end
work. I decided to hose all the road dirt out the engine room and do a bit
of scrubbing. For those of you who don't know split screen buses do not have
a firewall between the engine and the gas tank. When I was hosing out the
gas tank area a HUGE mouse nest roared out from behind(in front of FIF) the
gas tank. Yikes! A fully soaked nest. What could be move lovely ?

Mouse urine is acidic and will promote rust.

&gt; Good morning volks!

Tomorrow is the day for me to drive home my new '76 Westy and guess 
what?...I have a question.  The bus has been sitting on a wooded lot for 
about a year and has a family of mice living in it.
