Subject: [T2] Stretch

Hey everybody.

I'm new to this list.  I own a 76 Bus, nothing fancy, 2 litre  changed from
fuel injection to a two barrel.  Judging from the performance of the carb,
someone should have left it F.I.

My question is, has anyone ever tried stretching their Bus?  I was thinking
that if I had an extra 6-8 inches aft of the back wheels, I would have the
ultimate machine for my purposes.  I thought about adding it right where the
seam is.  I know a lot of 60's Busses got chopped in the middle, but how
about the reverse?  Any advise?
