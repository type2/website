Subject: Re: [T2] Side marker lens seal

Hiya Bennie,

I was in the same spot as your friend not too long ago.  I looked all over 
the place here in the States and I could not find anybody selling the seals 
alone.  If your friend has to have the seals I think he will have to purchase 
the entire bulbholder unit which does come with a seal.  Quite a few 
aftermarket parts houses sell these.  Sadly, they are a little spendy for 
what you get.
