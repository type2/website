No, let's not do that.  This is a survey, which is explicitly listed in the 
charter as being a Friday-only topic.  My watch says it's Wednesday.  Send 
all the p-mail you want, but DO NOT reply to the list on this 
subject!  Consider this thread killed and don't forget to refer to the 
charter before you post.

Thanks,
