Subject: [T2] broken brake bleeder valve

Happy New Year All!! I hope those of you (us) in the midwest are staying warm!!  Any way, while replacing front brake pads on my 75 riviera camper, I sheered off one of the bleeder valves on the caliper, luckily, it never opened, so no fluid is getting out there.  I can still bleed from the other valve (2 on each caliper)enough to open and get to the pads.  I put everything back together again and it seems fine!  Questions:  1) Are there going to be any problems with this down the road that I am not foreseeing??  2) Why the _at_%$# did they put 2 bleeder valves on these, Was it because they knew morons like myself would be sheering off one during a brake job??!!??  Hoping everything will be fine in Ohio...
