In response to mentioning using 205's on the Westy:
IMO, running 205's on the front creates undo drag when turning- I've tried
all 3 sizes, and noticed this.  I've used the 195's that Michelin makes for
Sears (load C, 36psi max tires)  for 201,500   mi on a pretty heavy 78
Westy with NO failure problems, in fact, get center wear on tire if I go
over 33 psi in back!  Used them (Sears) on my 71 Westy before that; never a
tread problem.  I took the better XZS??? Michelin tires off a van and use
the 185's on it in the front.  It had the 40psi tires on the back; will try
them when mine wear out.
