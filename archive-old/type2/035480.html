Subject: New Microbus

Since It's Friday - this weeks copy of &quot;Automotive News&quot; (an industry
weekly paper)  proclaims as it headline  &quot;VW tries to revive Microbus&quot;
along with a picture of a splitty panel, loaf and Vanagon (air cooled of
course)! 

 You may have heard this before - but they are actually doing design work
now.  Apparently one of the design studies was rejected because it
resembles the T5 - an internal code for the next generation EuroVan.

The main problem is safety - they want the flat nose for that Van look. 
They ought to check out that Vanagon vs, Volvo site - seems that flat
nosed Vanagon toasts the Volvo.  (I think you can acess it through
vanagon_dot_com)  

Quote from Jens Neuman VW board member  &quot;You can't turn around physics,
and the looks, this retro feeling together with some futuristic design,
can only be done if the nose is really flat.&quot;      Wish I had his e-mail
to get him to vanagon_dot_com

also - Get rid of the original design and &quot;then the whole idea of the
Microbus is gone.&quot;

Anybody want a liitle more info P=mail me.  I'm in digest mode = I'll
answer later tonight.  BTW, VW sold 66,069 Type II's in 1970.  Groovy
Baby!
