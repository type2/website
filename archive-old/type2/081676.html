Subject: Re: [T2] More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions

I apologize if I was a bit to particular on the &quot;Do both sides at the same
time&quot; question...  I envisioned you running back and forth from side to side
due to some mystical force that required each component of the procedure be
offset by the same thing on the other side.  Of course I agree with Steve.
I would never do just one side and then cruise around hoping to do the other
side at some other time.

Good luck,
Bill

p.s.  Good point on the squeezing the bushing thing.  I forgot to mention
that.  Helps a lot on reinstall too!

&gt; Brandt, Volks,
&gt;
&gt; I have seen the other responses, but want to throw a couple mor pence in
&gt; the fountain....

&gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)Do I have to do both sides at the same time? Is there some tension
thing I
&gt; &gt; am missing? Seems like I am (step 19 Mike Gensler, in Library)
&gt;
&gt; You don't have to, but it is wise to.  the general rule on anything
&gt; related to suspension/brakes is to do both ends of the axle at the same
&gt; time.  with the ball joints, you are committed to a front end alignment
&gt; afterward, why pay for two?  The tension thing is that there is still a
&gt; pre-load holding the upper arms against the horn of the front axle beam
&gt; and it is difficult to get the upper arms off as a result.  Mike
&gt; Gensler's article describes it well.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 2)My upper Bus-boys pre-pressed balljoints don't have the hex shaped
&gt; &gt; &quot;eccentric ring&quot; on the upper ball joint. Should I be concerned?
&gt;
&gt; No, they swap from the old arms.  Removal can be a bear, but they are
&gt; *not* welded on (appearances to the contrary :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 3)Are the torsion arm seals NLA? Do they usually need to be replaced?
And
&gt; &gt; what about the needle bearing? (Bentley 2,18 Fig 7-16) Does a 78 have
this?
&gt; &gt; and is it NLA? or usually worn to the point of needing replacement?
&gt;
&gt; I have always clened and reused the seals.  They really don't wear.  If
&gt; the needle bearings are bad, then you need a new beam.  Even if they were
&gt; available, the procedure for removal and replacement is &quot;involved&quot;  I have
&gt; never woried about it and so far, it has not bitten me.  I wipe a rag over
&gt; them and check to be sure they do roll.  So far all have been fine.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 4)Should I use anti seize on anything when I put it back together? Is it
&gt; &gt; worth getting a socket that fits the ball joint nuts for proper torque?
And
&gt; &gt; What kind of grease should I buy? Brand, type?
&gt;
&gt; I anti-seize all nuts as a matter of principal.  I am thinking of the next
&gt; time I do the job in another 20 years :-)  The socket... err... I have a
&gt; big combo wrench that I use and just go for &quot;dying heave&quot; tight on those
&gt; nuts.  they are big buggers and can take it :-)  Grease is any competent
&gt; front-end grease.  Lithium is good, but this is not a high-temp or
&gt; high-speed application, just high pressures so any good grease will do the
&gt; job.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, I ordered (Bus Depot) tie rods, all four shocks, all new brake
&gt; &gt; pads/shoes and rear clyinders, front brake hoses, plus other stuff.
Every
&gt; &gt; rubber seal/boot in the front end of this bus is shot. Now I find myself
&gt; &gt; wondering if I should do the front wheel bearings and swing lever
bushings
&gt; &gt; while I'm at it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5)Would this make sense? (bearings, swing lever bushings)
&gt;
&gt; This is a definite can of worms.  The more you do, the better your bus
&gt; will do, but there has to be a &quot;sanity limit&quot; somewhere.  Certainly  check
&gt; them all as they come off, but pace yourself.  If the rest of the front
&gt; end is in bad shape, the swing lever is certainly suspect as well.  wheel
&gt; bearing are a separate job in my mental catalogue and I would leave them
&gt; for another day.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 6)Finally, any tips for the stabilizer bar clamps? the one with the
slide on
&gt; &gt; clip. C-clamp maybe?
&gt;
&gt; This is what caused me to write and add my pence...
&gt;
&gt; I have and use a large-jaw Vice Grip 12LC to compress the rubber bushing.
&gt; Use lots of penetrating oil, bang the clamp on the side to loosen up the
&gt; rust before you attempt to punch it off.  Remember there is a tongue
&gt; insice the U, and if you bang on both, nothing is going to happen (ask me
&gt; how I know :)  But the biggie is to use the 12LC to compress the bushing.
