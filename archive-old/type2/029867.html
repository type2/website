Someone was mentioning the JC whitney soundproofing and said it was just
like dynamat. Well there are different dynamats. the original is the
asphalt based stuff that conforms to the surface. The JC stuff is the one
that uses partially open cell foam which is a moisture collector which Im
still somewhat loath to use. The original type of dynamat is more similar
to the ice dam stuff which was not recommended due to vapor release.
