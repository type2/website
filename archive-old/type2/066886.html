&gt;I don't either, but couldn't you just get one of those round tanks you see
&gt;at gas stations and RV places, the kind you swap out when you need it
&gt;refilled, and mount it under the seat somewhere? Why would you have to have
&gt;a Westy propane tank?

I didn't think I was interested, but maybe I am...  you say mount it under
the seat somewhere- the tank I'm assuming.  Where does the heat come out?
This might be a dumb question, but I haven't seen the description of this
thing, just how exciting it is that we might be able to get a deal on it...
If heater is connected right to the tank, wouldn't it be dangerous to have
it anywhere underneath anything?  Seems like it should sit right behind
front seats very well strapped to something or other...
