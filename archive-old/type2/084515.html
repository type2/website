Subject: sway bar mounting clips

--=====================_2262313==_.ALT

I've heard many horror stories on how difficult it is to install the stock 
style front sway bar mounts.  Mine were real easy.  I put all the stuff 
together and slipped the &quot;U&quot; shaped thingys over the lower trailing arm.  I 
then used a pair of vice grips to gradually sping the &quot;U&quot; shaped thingy 
closed enough to get the wedge retainer on.  Then I slowly tapped the wedge 
retainer on while increasing the tightness of the vice grips.  It worked 
like a charm.  I hope this helps other folks.  Greg
