&lt;&lt; How come you couldn't import one and update it.
&gt;I knew a guy a few years ago who imported a Mercedes 280 SL from Germany
&gt;and had to change the lights and a few other things but he could do it
&gt;and with the exchange rate at the time came out a little ahead.

And if I read the Brazilian web site correctly, you can pick up one of 
these new buses for about $12,500 USD.

I seem to remember a few years ago there was a web site advertising
used Brazilian Busses for sale, including shipping...What was missing
from the equation were the problems involved with registering and
licensing a vehicle that wasn't &quot;made&quot; to US specs...A &quot;grey market&quot;
car might be converted to US specs by changing some things that
the equivalent US model has...The big problem with the Brazilian Bus
is that there is no equivalent US model to convert to...Essentially, 
if you tried this, you'd have to research the specs yourself and
prove to the DOT (among others) that the Bus meets those specs.
For an example, Bill Fink in San Francisco would buy Morgan cars from
the factory and convert them one by one in his warehouse...This was
after months of researching the specs to just find out the regs and
rules that were required...The car was converted to propane to meet
emissions for example and the bumpers were backed with a shock ab-
sorber system to meet 5 mph requirements, etc. etc. The final cost
was double what a Morgan would cost in England...And that was years
ago...The same model Morgan is not sold in the US anymore...The
specs have moved on to the point where it cannot be &quot;upgraded&quot;
because of the design limitations of the vehicle...The same limita-
tions are probably integral to the Brazilian Bus... ;-(
