Subject: childs cot

Listees,

Last summer I bought a childs cot that I assumed would fit my 74 Westy.  This childs cot has solid steel poles that are supposed to hook into the clips in the cab area.  However, these poles are too short and will not work with the 74.  Does anyone know what years this childs cot will fit?

Having said the above, does anyone have the adjustable childs cot that is supposed to go with the 74?  Ideally, I would like to find someone that wants to trade the one I have for the correct one I need.

Thanks as always,

Ed Woenker
74 Westy
