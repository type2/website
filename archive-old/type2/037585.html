I tried to post this last Friday but......

VW 1973 Camper Vans (2), refrig., stove, runable, non-op. $300
559-216-4077

If this is $300 for 2 Westies.....heck of a deal.... I believe the price has
dropped, I think last week it was $500.

Now you know as much as I do.  I can find out more if anyone is interested.
I wish I had the area to buy and store them......
