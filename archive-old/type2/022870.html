All of those wires really should be soldered to their respective spade 
connector.
I nearly &quot;bought it&quot; one dark night on a freeway 'cuz a wire broke loose.
It scared me pretty badly.

Very next day...
I broke loose all connectors and soldered.
I routed the wires STRAIGHT out their spade connectors for a short 
distance before allowing any bending of the wire as it completes it 
circuit journey to wherever.

The wires are now free to vibrate without breaking, and now the spade 
connector will not come loose from the wire by eating off wire strands.
