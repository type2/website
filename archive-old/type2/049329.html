&gt; i've thought of this too. they sell the fire extinguishers on carparts_dot_com. as
&gt; for a detector you could probably rig something up using a spring to pull out
&gt; the pin on the extinguisher and some material that burns at a certain
&gt; temperature retaining the spring so that if a fire broke out it would melt or
&gt; burn the retainer and the spring would pull out the pin and activate the
&gt; extinguisher.  this is similar to how a sprinkler head works, at least the old
&gt; fashioned kind.
&gt; or you could run the cable to the cab and pull it if you saw lots of smoke.

I think we're in business, folks...

On a Safety-Kleen parts washer, there is a wire that holds the lid up. If
the solvent in the tank catches fire, the wire melts and lets the lid drop,
which is supposed to cut off the air to the fire and cause it to go out.

Next time the Safety-Kleen guy comes to our shop, I'll ask him if he knows
where to get some.

A spring, some of this wire, a few eyebolts...maybe a grommet for the cable
to pass through so you could put the bottle inside the Bus. I would want a
second cable up in the cab just for backup.
