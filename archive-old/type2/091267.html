Subject: Alternator finally in!

Put new bosch alternator in without crying once and
still got most of my digits.
Second time around, I'm getting better at it--took
about 2.5 hours. Whew! I have not been that intimate
with anything since my girlfriend left town.

But it was worth it when the red light went out. 

Thanks to all on the list who held my hand and offered
advice. 

Things I discovered while crawling around the engine:

* P.O. took out all the cooling regulators like
flappers, thermo, etc.

* Calling the wiring in the engine compartment a
&quot;rats' nest&quot; is an insult to rats.

 * I got a Big gap in the sheet metal at the firewall.

Now that i have ample electricity, i guess i should 
get a radio.

Again thanks to the list--I'm on the road again.
