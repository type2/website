&gt; I know North Carolina takes samples of the gas being sold at each station to

&gt; what's what if you know how to read it for that.

Do regular and high test really have different densities?  Back when I was
in college we had to use a special motor-driven test engine with variable
compression and standard fuels to measure octane rating accurately.
