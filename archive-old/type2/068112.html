What do you mean, &quot;walkthrough?&quot;

Your account of Hot Springs, etc. really hit home.
I was there too, about the same time.  I spent the
better part of the months of june and july at the 
rainbow gathering (i'm fully into the life) and 
on the way back to texas i took a couple trips to 
hot springs.  I proposed to my wife-to-be there,
up in the national park above bathhouse row, then
made her take a bath at the buckstaff.

That night, we went north, to where there is a 
gravel road that goes up and over the mountain
to a little-known part of lake ouachita (I'm naming
my next horse or dog or child Ouachita!).

Our poor vehicle did not want to do that much 
gravel, so we stopped about halfway, and camped 
in the beautiful woods, threatened by Weyerhauser
of course, but they exist for the moment.

peace to you.  let us know how was albaquerque.

After a number of decimal places, nobody gives a damn.
