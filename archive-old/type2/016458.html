Subject: WTB tailpipe for OEM Type IV muffler

Hi Gang

This may sound like a strange request to some, but I have an original
equipment German muffler (72-74 type IV engine) that needs a tailpipe.

It's not the style that exits on the Pass side off the end of the
muffler, this puppy comes out of the muffler at a 45, (halfway across
the body of the muffler) and exits out the drivers side.

Pictures being worth their weight in gold, please look in the Bentley
type II green manual:

- Section 5 pg 11 in the early version with the coloured wiring
diagrams...

- Section 5 pg 13 in the later version...

This is a new muffler, going on my 79 Federal motor, otherwise I
wouldn't bother y-all.

If anyone has one they would like to sell, or has the bits to mount it,
please let me know.

Thanks a bunch.

Den.
