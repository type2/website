If it's the same as a '78, you just remove the hinge screws (under the seal)
and it comes right off.  If I remember rightly, you only have to take one
side off.  The stay that holds it up is so easy to get off I can't remember
how I did it.  I do remember taking it off completely.  Installation is the
reverse of removal :)

&gt; Can anyone give me a run-down on how to remove the engine lid 
&gt; for a '72 bus? (AND the re-installation) I checked the 
&gt; library and the archives, but to no avail.
