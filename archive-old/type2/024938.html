Subject: FS '80-'91 master cylinder

New(ish) well essentially new.  Installed on the '90 about a
year ago about 3 months before I traded it in and I pulled it
right back off and installed the original for the trade (which was
never bad I was chasing a WEIRD brake problem I never did
rectify after replacing everything but the steel lines on the van)

So it has 3 months use, been on the shelf in storage since.
'90 reservoir (late large style) which was washed with 99%
isopropyl alcohol and then brake fluid is on it and included.
Reservoir is from auto tranny but you should be able to clip the
nipple for manual tranny.  Brake switches are the very late 2
terminal style I might be able to dig up 3 terminal switches else
you will have to install your own.  German I'm not sure if it is
ATE or FAG I paid $115 local boxed as Bendix.

I'm not dying to sell this and considering it has the reservoir
I want $95 for it since BD seems to want $100.  Anyway as
new, I would probably include an '87 vacuum assist can for
not much more if you need it depending on how hard they are
to pull.  Actual UPS shipping from Morgantown WV.
