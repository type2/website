Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Westy Electrical - wipers/rear window defroster

Thanks Troy.

I can read the Bentley schematics but it easier to hear what is supposed to 
be there and then verify with a schematic. That means I should have the 
wiper relay somewhere. Now where did I put it 3 years ago???

&gt;
&gt;Chris,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From memory(I'm at work right now)...   3 relay's
&gt;
&gt;Troy Wicals should have several rear of fuse box shots i did for him
&gt;that
&gt;show all colors and placement.
&gt;
&gt;I have 78 champagne with defroster(not working) :-((
&gt;
&gt;Intermittent wipers...etc
&gt;
&gt;Chris, intermittent wipers all use the same idea...count off seconds
&gt;based
&gt;on some control setting and then send one shot of juice the the wiper to
&gt;
&gt;get it started....wait x seconds and do it again.
&gt;
&gt;Lots of other folks sell these also, including kit versions that you put
&gt;
&gt;together yourself...
&gt;
&gt;Cheers ,dave

&gt; &gt; We're working towards being road worthy soon. Presently I am doing
&gt; &gt; electrical things. I've completed the headlight relays and a few days
&gt;ago
&gt; &gt; removed all the VW stuff I was storing in the bus so I could work
&gt;inside.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's been a while since I took it apart and I need some guidance.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can someone take a look at their '78 Westy and count the number of
&gt;relay
&gt; &gt; boxes they have on the bottom of their fuse block?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have space for one or two more relays. There is wiring there for at
&gt;least
&gt; &gt; one relay. I have not investigated what the color codes on the wires
&gt;this
&gt; &gt; week b/c I have not had the time. I know I can find the answer in
&gt;Bentley
&gt; &gt; but can anyone set me straight from memory?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have two options on my bus I have not checked for operation yet. One
&gt;is
&gt; &gt; the rear window defroster. The other is that my bus is a Champagne
&gt;Edition
&gt; &gt; and it has factory intermittent wipers. Does this option use a relay
&gt;on the
&gt; &gt; fuse block? Is it the same relay as the blinker relay? Electrically it
&gt;
&gt; &gt; would work - the relay is a closed switch with opens once the load
&gt;heats
&gt; &gt; the contacts. The wipers would be the load and once the contacts open,
&gt;the
&gt; &gt; wipers would make one sweep and then park just like the driver had
&gt;turned
&gt; &gt; the wipers on and then off immediately in a basic bus without
&gt;intermittent
&gt; &gt; wipers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone investigated adapting the Golf or Jetta or Passat
&gt;&quot;programmable&quot;
&gt; &gt; delay relay to the VW bus? I know it was discussed by one of the VW
&gt;lists
&gt; &gt; at one time. Basically you install this relay and based on a process
&gt; &gt; involving how you turn the wipers on and off, you can set the delay.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know JC Whipme has generic delay kits but I am interested in the VW
&gt;version.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks to any and all that can help.
