&gt;My question is: why is 7.5deg BTDC best for my vehicle?  Bentley and the

&gt;know what timing setting is best?  I always thought I'd be fine if I went
&gt;by the book.  Also, is this likely to change ever?  Can I always set the
&gt;timing at 7.5BTDC from now on?

I figure you already know this info from the URL above: the federal and CA models seem to have different timing settings for 1979.

The answer to your question may reveal itself if you identify for ignition parts by number and determine if you have a federal parts in your CA bus.
