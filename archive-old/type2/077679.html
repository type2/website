Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Valves

Would a washing machine valve last when exposed to gasoline? Those are 
solenoids designed to open while the washer fills but snap shut. Basically 
a normally closed valve .Would that last?

&gt; &gt; I've been looking for said &quot;automatic&quot; valve that would open when the
&gt; &gt; ignition was turned on but have so far been unable to find it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Would be a great safety item in case of fire - would keep fuel from beeing
&gt; &gt; added to the fire and would require no effort to close - I'm certainly not
&gt; &gt; going to lean under my bus to turn a valve!!!
&gt;
&gt;hmmmmm,  wonder if any washing machine or other similar device uses a
&gt;valve that works on 12 volt.  that would do the job.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe a brass valve with a choke cable added to the lever...
&gt;
&gt;I was also considering this, or possibly from an interstate (greyhound
&gt;type) bus that is required to have a &quot;dump valve&quot; that shuts the engine
&gt;down under any circumstance.   maybe from an old bus.  buses went 24v
&gt;somewhere in the late 60's early 70's.
&gt;     Just a push  button under a safety cover activate the dump valve which
&gt;releases a spring loaded valve that slams shut.   depending on the design
&gt;it would probably require some rework.  they have to be manually reset so
&gt;that would be a consideration too.
&gt;
&gt;hmmmm, got me thinking, I work it the bus industry so I may start nosing
&gt;around see what I can find
