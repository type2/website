Subject: Condensation

I'm in Digest form (yes I know, painful), so am not sure who originally 
posted about condensation...

Regarding the business of condensation inside the bus with the (propane?) 
heater. Isn't water one of the by-products of combusting propane? Back in 
the UK, where we had portable propane heaters in our cheap student 
squats, it was always a big issue with mould and all kinds of nasty stuff 
growing, and I'm not talking about Margaret Thatcher.

I suppose I might as well make this a digest type post.

Somebody was looking for 12v LIGHTS and I found some very nice ones in my 
local marine supply store. They also had an amazing range of fibreglass 
products which I guess would be perfect for pop-tops. All the 12v stuff 
was on the whole pretty high quality and suited for high corrosion 
environments.

1) Where can I get replacement handles for my 79 Westy cupboards - you 
know the black/grey ones that you have to push in a button to open them, 
except the plastic has cracked where they are screwed to the door.

2) My steering wheel is sticky and I have tried everything to clean it. 
Any suggestions?

3) I reversed into a wall and the rear bumper put a nice crease in the 
roundy bit of bodywork behind the bumper. I tried hitting it out from 
behind but it was too stiff. Should I get some body shop to work on it, 
or just fill the crease with bondo and go on my way. Cost is an issue - 
and I do have a lot of time on my hand.

Thanks in advance. Les Hall.
