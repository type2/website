Subject: removing generator

I think I've got everything I need for an alt/gen
swap.
I'm going to pull my generator with the engine in,
using Muir as a guide.
Any tips from old scarred hands out there?
Someone on the archives speculated that it might be
easier to remove the big fan nut first and pull off
the generator.

Not looking forward to this job, any ideas appreciated.
