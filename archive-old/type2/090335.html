Subject: Re: [T2] Painting muffler

&gt; My Hecho en M=E9xico muffler I bought locally to get my bus running is
&gt; starting to burn off the paint after only 2 months.  (I have nice heater
&gt; boxes and those triangular flanges, thank you).
&gt;
&gt; When I bought it I figured I'd have to paint it but I didn't realize it
&gt; would be so soon.  Will high-temp spray paint (1400F), the kind they use =
for
&gt; BBQs and such work ok, a la Home Depot, or do I need to find something
&gt; specific to handle exhaust heat?

The paint doesnt last on any of them. You can use BBQ paint but will have
to respray as it doesnt last. I just keep the can in the bus and shoot it
whenever iti looks bare.  Maybe whenever I need to replace it Ill
get the SS original style one.
Could be awhile, this one is german and I salvaged it from a rotton free
bus I got. Its about the most solid durable muffler Ive had.
