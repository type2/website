The running on upon shutoff is caused by hot bits of carbon deposit 
in the combustion chambers. This will occur at normal temps. Best 
verify your mixture first. Read the plugs. If the mix is good and the 
plugs show carbon, you have either worn valve guides and/or 
rings/cylinders. Try a one shot treatment of Techron to see if it improves.

&gt;  When I got to the top and  shut it off, I opened the hatch.  I was 
&gt; amazed that it was quite  cool in the engine compartment.  Didn't 
&gt; feel a lot of heat coming  off of the engine, either.  The bus runs 
&gt; great.  Is this a  sign that I'm OK temperature-wise?

Yes!!!!
