James Matta asked

&gt;        Please excuse the ignorance. Can someone tell me what a &quot;Kombi&quot; is?
&gt;
A Kombi was a model of VW Type 2 bus which was really just a panelvan with
windows and seats in the back. The rear interior was painted in primer and
had no panels or headlining (tho VW dealers could fit cardboard panels as
optional extras). I don't think (and someone can correct me if I'm wrong)
that VW ever officially sold these beasts in the US. In South Africa and
Australia (and prolly elsewhere) Kombi has become a generic term for any VW
Type 2.

Next up in terms of spec was the Standard Microbus, which had vinyl-covered
side panels and a headlining, with the Deluxe Microbus top of the range and
featuring windows all round and sunroof and skylights.

Hope that explains things.
