Subject: Save this bus

After 4 years of little or no progress, it's time to admit that I'll 
never finish the 1973 Campmobile project.

The Particulars:

1973 Campmobile, complete (if somewhat beat up) interior. Lost an 
argument with a deer, so it has a crumpled nose (I have a new Bus 
Depot nose for the bus, uninstalled). Canvas is shot, but I have new 
Bus Depot canvas (uninstalled). Front seats need re-upholstering (I 
have new Bus Depot front seat covers). Engine is a rebuilt 1.8 L with 
less than 500 miles on it, but it's sat for a couple of years without 
being run. Brakes are in a bad way - almost solid rust (that's why 
it's sat unstarted) - I have many, but not all, of the necessary 
parts (needs front rotors and maybe calipers). Has child's cot and 
the canvas upper bunk (canvas in bunk is shot). Other than the 
brakes, little rust.

As a general rule, I only have money to spend on parts if and when I 
get money back from Uncle Sam from my taxes; the last couple of years 
that cash has been redirected to &quot;higher priority&quot; items by my wife. 
She has also nixed the idea of my giving the bus to my 17 year old 
for him to fix up and use. Rather than see it rot away, would some 
listee be interested in making an offer? The parts alone cost $700, 
and ought to be worth something.

Bus is in Clemson South Carolina (in the north west corner of SC, 
near north Ga, east TN, and west NC); pictures at: 
http://ehs.clemson_dot_edu/robin/SCAN.JPG ; I'll happily take and post 
more upon request.
