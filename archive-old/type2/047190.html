Subject: [T2] FS Vanagon Headlights and Grill

Well for anyone looking for some reason to update their aircooled
to a later look, I have a nice set of '87 headlights (the 4 light system)
and a '90 grill (fits the same, just I kept the '90 as it has a bigger
VW symbol.)  The lights have no nicks, chips, cracks, leaks but are
a bit hazed (off a 120k car.)  The grill is nice enough, but emblem is
a bit scratched.  The left low beam needs one new adjuster, which
will probably set you back $5-$10 knowing VW, I have not looked into
it, but that is about what a similar Quantum adjuster cost me.  I will
include connectors and wiring harness back as far as I can, and the
couple little tabs you'd need to poprivet on to mount the lower inboard
mounting screws for the buckets.  This is basically a plug and play
upgrade folks, a drill, a poprivet gun, a solder gun to do it right, and
maybe about an hours work.

I want $275 for the whole shebang, Ron is getting $200 a side
for new lights, $250 for the grill, about $650 for the whole lot.
This is what a junkyard would want around me anyway.

This is a nice looking upgrade and the high beams are simply
exceptional though the lows are only about even to a set of
sealed style halogen 7&quot; rounds.  In fact a good 7&quot; round Hella or
Cibie H4's put out better light, but like I said, it looks good and
gives the van a newer appearance.  Much better than incadescent
7&quot; rounds anyway.

$275 obo, you pay shipping from Morgantown, WV, I pay for
packaging.

I'll take a few pics I can email to show the lights and the emblem
this weekend.
