I'm looking at tire size substitutes for the stock 185R14 tire size which is
recommended for Type 2s.  In order to do this, I need to find out what the
aspect ratio is for a 185R14 tire (or at least find out what the total
height is in inches).  I've seen references to 78, 80, and 83.  Which one is
it?

Thanks.
