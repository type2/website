Subject: Need 1600 D/P rebuilt in L.A. area..

Hi Volks,

Here's da problem.  Small horizontal crack between #3 and the 
oil cooler case plate (doghouse) on a 1600 Dual Port.  Options:

1)  Get it welded by a pro with aluminum welding equipment. Getting
    mixed signals on this..

2)  Buy a rebuilt engine.  Here in L.A. I saw a rebuilt for
    $385.  I might find one around greater L.A. a little cheaper..
    (anyone know where ???)

The current engine is really good except for this stupid crack that
manages to pump out oil.  Because of where the crack is, the head and
cylinders have to come off (wouldn't 'ya know).  Labor costs may get
close enough to may the new rebuilt worthwhile.  

Ideas and opinions welcome.._dot_decision is Monday afternoon..

TIA !
