&gt; As soon as I make a left turn, it happens- loud, vibrating
&gt; noise, from the front. I hit the brake pedal really hard, like 3
&gt; times, and it stops, and we're still rolling. Weird...so I drive some
&gt; more, no problem with straight, stopping, starting, or right turns,
&gt; but as soon as I make a left turn, I get this noise. My best guess is
&gt; that the brakes are somehow grabbing, because when I stomp the pedal,
&gt; it stops, but why the heck would it only happen on left turns? What do
&gt; left turns have to do with the brakes? Argh!

Richard,

My guess (and this is *just* a guess would be wheel bearings or king pins
('64, right?  has the king pin front end?) with other things to look at
being rust in the front axle beam, tie rods, and shock mounts. I don't
think the brakes are the problem, I think they are a temporary cure.  As I
am reading it, whatever is going wrong, it starts up a vibration during
the turn and the braking is stopping that vibration.  Check?  There are a
lot of things up front that can go into a cycle of vibration if they are
not tied down properly and many times the stress of braking will break the
cycle and calm it back down for a while.
