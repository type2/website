Subject: Re: [T2] PC in Bus

That's beautiful, and EXACTLY the model of mine. =D

However, mine's far from looking that nice. :(

You rebuilt all the wood inside? I'm considering that just because of the
fact that when I got it home it REEKED of mold. Several seals were shot.
While I'm replacing all the foam and fabric, I'm debating about the wood. I
probably will just because of the quantity that needs to be replaced to
service my entertainment center.

Here's what I've got so far: http://www.donimages_dot_com/1973bus

&gt; As many of the listies know and are probably tired of hearing about,
&gt; I've had a few incarnations of bus'puter in my 73 over the last year
&gt; and a half, a desktop PC hacked up with an inverter, a few mini-itx and
&gt; 12v mini-itx systems and a G4 powerbook.
