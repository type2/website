Yo,


Those are the same ones I got a wally world(wal-mart)...I think they might 
have been cheaper there....

They work good so far...no sliding when driving up them, easy to handle.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; If you use ramps make sure they are the Heavy gauge fully welded kind . You
&gt; &gt; see ones that are inadequately braced and some times riveted instead of
&gt; &gt; welded. A friend of mine had an uncle who was killed when the ramps buckled
&gt; &gt; from the weight of the vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; Or use these...

&gt; These are the Rhino Ramps. 12,000 lbs GVWR. Made from some space age plastic
&gt; that's guaranteed not to rust, corrode, splinter or knock the front spoiler
&gt; off your Bus. Get 'em at your local FLAPS.
&gt; 
&gt; Disclosure: this guy's a customer of mine, but I don't get paid anything for
&gt; plugging his stuff.
