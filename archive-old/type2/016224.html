Subject: New battery cables = strange results
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hi all,

	I've been reading the list since I got my '76 bus almost a year ago, but I
haven't been posting too much.  Now, however I need help.  My battery died
this weekend, and as it looked very old, and the cables were all chewed up, I
decided to get a new battery and cables.  I cleaned out all the rust and junk,
and got a new battery tray and connections, and installed (I thought very
carefully) the new cables.  After I was done and tested it out, I got nothing.
There is power, the headlights are bright, radio, etc., work when the key is
on. But when I try to start her up from inside I hear a little click from
somewhere, and sometimes a little hissing noise, that's it.  When I use the
key in the engine compartment, it starts up just fine, and sounds great.  The
ignition switch on the steering column has never worked, when I bought it had
a button in the dash that someone had installed to bypass the switch.  Turning
the key to &quot;on&quot; and pressing the button has always worked just fine.  So,
anyone have any ideas?  Did I make a wrong connection somewhere or what?  Or
did this bypass button get disconnect somehow?  Does anyone know exactly how
something like this should be connected?  I've spent all afternoon looking
around and I have no more ideas, so I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks a lot,

Tim Boulay
