&gt; I am still in the process of finding a replacement front axle beam for
&gt; Brunhilda, my '73 Westie.  I have got a couple of leads on a used axle,
&gt; but it would help to know if axle beams from other earlier/later years
&gt; will fit.  Anyone know?
&gt;

Don:
71 to 79 are the same housings; 70 is similar but you'll need to weld on
brackets to mount the booster. If you're looking to transfer the ENTIRE
assembly get one from a 73 or later- 71-72 used different spindles,
rotors and calipers. 
I got a really nice one for my 69 some years back from Blair and sons
(or was it brothers?) in Phoenix some years back. Nice guys to deal
with! Said they ship out rust-free stuff all the time.
When doing this swap, please remember to remove the front half of the
shift likage. I bent mine before I figured this out (duh!).
