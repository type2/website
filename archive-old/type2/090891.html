Subject: Shift Coupler

Hi I was wondering what exactly is a shift coupler?  Do I need a new one or are used ones Ok?  And is it something that can be re-built?  I have some problems shifting sometimes, and most people are telling me that's what's wrong with it, but all I know about shift couplers are their names...so can anybody educate me about these things?
