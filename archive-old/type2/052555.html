Subject: [T2] 71 intake manifold

Sorry to make this a list post but I deleted the gentlemans post.

I was checking out 'thebusco_dot_com' and saw an intake manifold for 
sale.  I doesn't say if it's for all three pieces or not but
if it does $25.00 would be a decent price.  Al Brase was correct
though,  just get it from a beetle...thousands of those made.  
As proof of this I just picked one up from my local pick n pull 
for $20.  All three sections.  From a beetle. Sorry,not 4 sale. :)
