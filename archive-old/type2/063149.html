Subject: re:old cases and faying surfaces

Mike West wrote that he was cleaning an old engine case for salvage 
when he discovered a lot of black stuff on the faying surfaces and a 
lot of pitting of flat areas particularly in the sump.  (I had to 
consult Webster to learn the meaning of faying. duh!)  Mike said in his 
missive that the black stuff was aluminium oxide. Here I always thought 
aluminum oxide was white but perhaps when homogenized with carbon it 
becomes black.

I understand that severe pitting in crankcases is usually caused by 
acidic condition of the lubricant which could be due to accumulated 
water combined with heating/cooling cycles.  (I've seen the final 
drives on Cats pitted from the effect of acidic gear oil) 

What I fail to understand is where the aluminium oxide comes from.  I 
always heard that the VW cases were magnesium, not aluminum.  Or are 
they an alloy of both.  I know they burn like mag.

Enlighten me please.
