Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal info (low ceiling)

&gt; [...]After removing the bumper, remove the rear valence body panel.  
&gt; Then you have a clear path to pull the engine straight out the back, no 
&gt; need to jack the bus up at all.  It's way easier than a beetle.
&gt; 
This is only a valid option up through 1971.  In 1972 when they went to
the Type 4 engine the removable valence panel was removable no more.  I
think the person with the original question had a later Bus.
