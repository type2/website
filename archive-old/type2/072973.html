What can I say about Dolan other than he is my good brother.  I would be
embarrassed to tell you of all Steve has done for me, but proud to claim
him as an example of the way I want to be when I grow up.

I have lived with him, ate with him, laughed with him, and read with him.
He is one of the most intelligent and knowledgeable people I know.

I was living in his house when steve took over the admin of the list.  I
know how hard he worked to learn all of the geeky shit ya gotta learn to do
such a thing.  He was anxious, excited, and thrilled with the opportunity
to serve this hobby of ours.  He succeeded in doing just that very well.

I appreciate ya brother,

Charlie Ford
