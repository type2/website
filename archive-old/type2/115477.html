Subject: Engine urban legends.........

I have a customer/listee that has for years listen to the advice of an old
vw mechanic, and his bevy of assistants........

now the old guy was in business for 35+ years, so can't knock him for
that......and he is now deceased.  One of the mechanics that believes in
pulling thermostats, air flaps, etc............ANYWAY,

Well, unfortunately, this shop, now that it has been closed for a few years,
is a constant source of income for me.  I am all the time fixing the stuff
these guys half- assed.  It never ceases to amaze me, the pearls of wisdom
that this bunch of fellows that associated with the old-timer come up with.

1.  Run the engine rich..........that way the heads run cooler. Pulled
customers heads, caked with carbon.......seemed proud of the fact he was
running rich.

2.  Pull the flaps and thermostat..you just don't need them.

3. Set timing &quot;by ear&quot;  ..........every bus i have seen where these
goofballs have done that it is at least off by 10 degrees......._dot_usually
because there is a big vacuum leak they are masking

4.  Doing things in such a fashion that no manual ever stated.like undoing
the front (bell housing side) of the tranny with the engine to pull a
motor................not the whole engine and trans at the same time mind
you.......but just letting it dangle by the front motor mount............I
was helping a listee the other day put in his motor and he was insistent
that one of these fellows said this was the only way........he is a real
nice guy, so I bit my tongue and did not ask why the hell he was not there
helping since it was so easy this way?


The list goes on and on.  These same fellows are having to constantly
maintain there busses with half assed fixes instead of doing it right the
first time.  Sorry for the rant, just had to vent.......
