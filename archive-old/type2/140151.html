Subject: Re: Double cab with single cab bed

&gt;Several years ago I remember seeing a double cab on Ebay that had a
single &gt;cab
&gt;bed on it. So it was like a double cab with a long bed. I assume this
was a
&gt;custom build, has anyone ever seen this? Maybe a picture or a link to a
&gt;webpage about it? Maybe I dreamed it??

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Corbett

You didn't dream it! I have seen pictures. It was definitely custom
built. IIRC the person who posted the pictures had seen it so it wasn't
a PhotoShop effort!

Cheers,

Martin
