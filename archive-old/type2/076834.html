Subject: RE: [T2] 050 dizzy

&gt; I keep reading posts where people say they have a 050
&gt; distributor, like this one.
&gt;
&gt; What is the complete Bosch number on this or any 050 distributor?



It is the one that I described the other day:

&quot; I do have a different centrifugal-advance distributor which is said to
have slightly more appropriate timing characteristics for a 72-up bus
engine, for hardly more than the price of an 009. You will find a review of
this distributor on Type2_dot_com.   No reason to replace your stock vacuum
advance distributor with this unless you have to, but if you do have to, at
least this one is affordable and a better option than an 009.  Part # 9 230
081 050.  $66.50 with listmember discount.&quot;

This is the centrifugal one. Any other distributor ending in 050 is a
completely different beast. (Most others I've seen that ended in 050 were
vacuum advance Porsche distributors.)
