&gt;Couple quick questions about air correction jets:
&gt;
&gt;1) Despite the name, the air correction jet injects fuel into the 
&gt;carburator as opposed to air.
&gt;      I.E. It sprays fuel to correct the volume of air.  Is this correct?

No.  The air correction jet passes air, not fuel.

&gt;2) As a result of (1), and the fact that as air correction jet numbers 
&gt;INCREASE as the size of the
&gt;         jet DECREASES,

No, the numbers correspond to jet size just as with a main jet.

&gt;a 120z jet allows more fuel to pass through than a 150z jet.
&gt;         Correct?

That part is correct, but for the wrong reasons.  Here's the only way I can 
think of to explain it:  The air correction jet is more or less a &quot;leak&quot; in 
your main jet which allows air to displace some of what would otherwise be 
fuel.  It only really comes into play at higher rpms (say, 3500rpm and up 
depending on application) and a larger air correction jet allows more air 
in, which increases the A/F ratio which causes the mixture to lean out.  It 
is to compensate for a tendancy for carbs to run rich on the top end 
otherwise.

If anyone else has a more accurate or clearer description, please jump in.
