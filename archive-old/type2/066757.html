Subject: Re: Heat exchanger paint/Por-20 (Long)

&gt;Dank. Bummer. I've had pretty good luck with POR-15, and was hoping the
&gt;POR-20 stuff was as good... I guess the question goes back out then - is
&gt;there a good exhaust/manifold paint?

I have found that if you are going to go ALLL THE WAY and sand
it to bare, clean metal, and you dont want to pay to get it
aluminum jet-hot coated, then the galvanizing paint is the way
to go. 

I had a wee bit left in a spray can when I pained my extractor. 
I sanded a spot about the size of a playing card, mabye a little
bigger, all the way down, then sprayed this stuff on the bugpack
extractor, about 6 inches from the exaust port. Like I said, I
only had a little, and even if I had more, there was no way I was
going to spend 2-3 days sanding ALL the paint from the tubes.

Good news, two years later that spot is the only part that did not rust.

Bad news, cant remember the brand name of the stuff. I know I got it
at Homer D. Poe. for about $5-6 a can. Said something like '95% pure
zinc' or aluminum, or tin, or something. Dried really fast, and left
a kind of rough surface. I remember that it said it did  not need a
cover coat, and if you did coat it, use latex. I remember that becuase
I seriously thought it would be funny to see some Sears Weatherbeater
burning off the pipes. But, where the 2500 degree black exaust paint
(burned off in about a month) covered it a little from overlap
did not appear to hurt.

I use some of these parts for test beds of new coverings, etc.
I have 4 different kinds of exaust paint on that header/muffler 
combo. Only the 'spray zinc' or some other metal (I gotta keep
better notes!) has stayed on. It is not pretty, but at least
it stays. Just have to figure out how to get ALL the paint
off from underneath. Not easy with all the flanges, etc.

BTW, I dont think that it is the heat that burns off the 
high temp paint, I heard right from the rustoleum factory rep that
it is the water. You see, the Rustoleum BBQ paint is not waterproof.
It is pourous, like primer, and the water can get through to 
underneath. You hit one or two puddles, and the rust starts. I
met the factory rep at a Hardware store grand opening, and quizzed
him about that, because the muffler is all Rustoleum BBQ paint.
To them, BBQs are supposed to be kept in the garage, and not used
when it is raining. Sheesh. He could not reccommend any Rustoleum
products for exaust manifolds, which means he could not reccommend
any products.
