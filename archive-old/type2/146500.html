Subject: sooty plugs, still
To: jeremiah.stutte_at_gmail_dot_com



i still have sooty plugs.  just put in a new fuel pump and filter.
the fuel pressure jumped up much higher at idle from 30 psi with the
old pump to 35 with the new.  so out comes the old pressure regulater
and in goes a new. still too high.  in fact no change at all.  in my
'75 fuel injected auto tranny bus i drove around.  she ran better than
she had previously but very hot.  so i adjusted ever so little, like
an 1/8 of a turn, the fuel to air mixture on my afm.  she did not run
much cooler and suddenly i felt a tiny hiccup.  sure enough i less
power again.  soon she was acting as she had before; less power,
running cool, trying to die like some inept, wannabe martyr.  the afm
tested ok.  temp sensor 2 tested ok.  i have not tested the cold start
valve.  could that be causeing the high fuel pressure?  if not what
is?  all four plugs get fouled so i don't see how the problem could be
leaky injectors, but who am i?   PLEASE, HELP!  i want to go to
brewbus.
