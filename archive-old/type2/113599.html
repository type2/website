Subject: Lens tinting question

I bought my first pair of prescription sunglasses last year and discovered 
that they start out with a clear lens, do the grinding and then dip the 
lenses to tint them. Repeated dips result in darker tints.

I'm not interested at all in tinted lighting lenses on my bus - you know 
the type that looks KEWL in traffic until you almost crash into a car 
because brake light lenses are so dark the bulbs inside can't be seen... 
Their busy tinting lenses darker and I'm busy trying to make my lighting 
brighter.

ANYHOW does anyone know if there is a similar tinting in colors so I could 
tint lenses red or yellow?

Checking here first, going to the glasses shop next, checking the Internet 
later. Maybe this is a version of the old JC Whipme spray on window tint...
