Subject: ICT report.

Several people aked about the mileage I am getting
with the ICT's I just installed.
I saw a 4 mpg improvement on average over the
Progressive Weber.
I was getting about 11 mpg in town, went up to 15
immediately.
I got 18.5 on the road this weekend, never saw better
than 15 before.

A little on the anemic side, tends to bog down a
little more on hills than the Progressive did, but I
am still very pleased with the overall performance.
