&gt; I'm looking to add an access panel to my '72 bus.  It's such a pain in the

&gt; here on the list have experience with making a homebrew access panel?  I'd 
&gt; like some tips, since I'm definitely going to want to keep the 
&gt; noise/heat/fumes from the engine compartment to a minimum inside the bus.

I believe some folks have transplanted the hatch from a later bay into the
72 the details should be in the archives
