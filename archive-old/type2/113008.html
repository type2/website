Subject: Legal assistance  in Cincinnati

Hello volks-
Had a bad time with a PO who rated the 78 Westy we bought as  a  #2 
(needing no mechanical work) on  SAMBA. Our baby ended up needing over 
$3,000 worth of work.
Without going into a lot of detail, the PO has stated he has no moral, 
legal, or ethical responsibility for misrepresenting the bus. To top it 
off the guy is an Associate minister.
Anyway, wanted to know if there were any listees who are or who know of 
a good  legal counsel in the Cinci, OH area. We've tried other types of 
mediation to no avail.
This is not a simple case of buyer beware, as he blatantly 
misrepresented various aspects of the Westy in his ad.
Thanks for any help.
