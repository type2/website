Subject: GreenPiece Parts (75 Westy)

My deluxe isn't so deluxe, and I am looking for a few good parts.  Does
anyone have for sale or lease or trade or something the following things for
a 75 Deluxe?
- --the outside vent covers for the city water and ?vent? pipe, not the
electrical
- --the jump seat
- --sink unit/water tank
- --stove top for fridge unit
- --a seal for the pop top
Also, if I may, can anyone tell me the proper way to &quot;break in&quot; a newly
rebuilt engine?  I don't want to screw it up, it has 30 miles on it, 15 were
done by me, driving between 50 and 60 at varying speeds every couple miles.
 TIA
