Subject: Re: [T2] I'm starting to get it!

&gt; I went to Powell's Books and got a couple of children's books 

I've got young children which love our bus, and have done a fairly
good job remembering different basic parts when I've showed them.

If you think they'd be appropriate, would you mind sharing the names
of the books?

Anyone know if there is a model Volkswagen engine? I'd settle for a
beetle engine, but would probably pay double for a pancake.  Similar
to the plastic &quot;working&quot; V8's they sell during Christmas time.  My
boys aren't old enough for that yet (so my wife tells me. :-P)  Maybe
there are wooden craft plans... A quick google search didn't produce
much.

- Dean
