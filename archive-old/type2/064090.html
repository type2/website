&gt; I've heard this story before and don't think it's correct.

&gt; I have seen old Euro-style taillight lenses without the
&gt; &quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround, suggesting they were from the days when the
&gt; chrome bezel was still available. The &quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround lenses are
&gt; still available quite cheaply from VW dealers here. I may be wrong, but I
&gt; think that's the story behind the &quot;built-in&quot; chrome surround.

I stand corrected.  That'll teach me to trust something I read from an 
'80s edition of a SOTO newsletter. ;-)
