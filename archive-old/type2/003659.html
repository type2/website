Yes, my Adventurewagon has a top vent. The person I bought the van from in
Medford Oregon had just replaced the vent with a brand new one, as the other
one had been cracked. You have me worried now about the rusted out section
of your roof. Some of the posters felt that fuel mileage doesn't suffer from
having this roof on the van. Interesting. Real nice when you're cruising on
the interstate at a mighty 55 and a truck passes you, pushing you to the
right with their bow shock wave. :-)  The opening on mine doesn't look
crudely cut, it has a factory look to it, although different from the
Westy/sunroof reinforced look. As I said, the opening is 6&quot; longer than
Westy. I put the Westy hammock up there, had to weld a plate to extend it.

The quality of the  panelling in mine was very poor. As someone mentionned,
I saw an old ad for Adventure Vans at
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~shrike3/adventurer.html        in which the
panelling looked very high grade. No doubt, it looked great, wish mine was
like that.

So, you removed your roof and will reinstall it? Not tempted to use it for a
boat, put an outboard motor on it for white water rafting or something??:-)
What do you think of the tonneau cover idea?

to NCBUS- Yes, my roof is cut almost down to the rain gutters. You could be
right about the waterproofing issue.  The Marine shop had this moulding he
would sew onto the edge of the fabric,  that was like an inflated circle,
that functions as a seal. I'll have another close look at how close I'd be
to the gutter.

To Chuck Harvey-  It was a local Marine upholstery shop that gave me the
$400 Canadian price for the tonneau cover idea. I can give you his phone
number if you want, may be too far for you, although the $260 US dollar
price may look attractive to you!!  BTW, I spoke to a sunroof owner that
said you can stop them leaking if you clean out the drain channels to the
corners, even if the seal if crappy.  The shop is located in Southern
Ontario near London Ontario.  He uses  high grade stainless steel fittings
and materials, had some good ideas to keep it as watertight as possible. He
was thinking about a hardwood bow in the middle as on a pickup tonneau, but
wasn't sure if it was needed. . He recently did a sliding ragtop roof on a
splitty, looked really good. Thanks for the replies, this list is a great
thing!
