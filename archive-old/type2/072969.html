&gt;&gt;It had that script on the back hatch, but I didn't
&gt;&gt;grab it because it was screwed on in about four places and I didn't
&gt;&gt;think it was worth snagging.
&gt;
&gt;go through the rear hatch panel/cardboard/pressed pigeon sh!t, and
&gt;carefully pull off the rubber ding-dongs that hold the script. try it.

No, it was literally screwed on with these four little sheet metal screws
right through the emblem. I figured all those screw holes rendered it NG.
