Subject: 71 engine install question
Message-ID: &lt;19991028011921.20461.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Im getting ready to install the engine back into my 71 single cab. What I 
want to know is, should I install the engine hanger/support before or after 
I hook the engine to the tranny. I've always done it before, but i've always 
had trouble getting the hanger to mount up. A crowbar always helps, but its 
still a pain.

Thanks,
David
