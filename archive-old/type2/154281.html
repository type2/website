Subject: Re: [T2] US source for AH Schofield parts? or another source
  for  gutters?

I was thinking of going with this guy maned Gerson at
http://www.klassicfab_dot_com/  I dont know anyone personaly that has used his
stuff but have heard great things from guys on the samba. I also heard that
Metwiz was buying somethings from him rather than make them his self as it
was cheaper? If thats true thats says alot for his work!!

Ian


&gt; Does anyone know if there is a US source for AH Schofield gutters or
&gt; another source for replacements?
