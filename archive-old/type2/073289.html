Hey All,
	This should be an easy one. Last night our '78 bus's turn signals
went belly-up. They are blinking real fast. My first concern is that they
are having a flash back to the days of disco. Maybe a bad bulb or fuse?

Any one want to take a crack at this.
Perhaps I can pickup the parts on the way home.


Thanks
Jerry

Milwaukee, WI
