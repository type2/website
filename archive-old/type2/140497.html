Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Depot baywindow sliding windows?

&gt; I went to Ron's website to see the 'specials' he's got
&gt; going right now, and I see(or don't see) that the sliders
&gt; are gone.  Did Ron announce this, and if he did, did any
&gt; of you guys grab extras?!  I contacted BD and Karen
&gt; tells me that they have no plans to replace them.  What
&gt; do I do now?   Start scroungin'  for used ones again?
&gt; Are the replacement seals still available?


Unfortunately, many of the specials that I find are a &quot;get-em-while-you-can&quot;
proposition. Unfortunately the OE supplier of the sliding side windows sold
them all, and we are being told there won't be any more.  So, barring a
change of heart on their part (unlikely in my estimate, although anything
can happen), a used set will be your only option from here on out.  The
seals, however, remain available, and probably will be for some time.
