Subject: 78 Bus Literature including Champagne Edition Links

Dave was asking about some dealer literature for the '78 Bus including the
Champagne Edition the other day and I just so happen to have these items.
I've begun to scan and upload them (not totally finished yet) for all to
see.

Take a look and poke around in:

Enjoy!
