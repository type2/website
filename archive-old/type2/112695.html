I am not really familiar with the layout of the '78 ,, but I am pretty sure it
is effectively the same fridge as the '74

I was told the same thing,, there is a blockage in the Tx valve that opens and
closes to produce the high and low pressure which causes heat to be removed....
The blockage holds it open, and it will not create the pressure needed to cool.

This valve can be cleared by turning the fridge upside down, and tapping gently
on the tubing near the finned section..

I find that the fridge in my 74 just needs to be tapped every so often ,no need
to turn it upside down,, and then it will make ice.

Every Westy style fridge I have tried this on has been successful. But I have
never tried the '78 style

YMMV
