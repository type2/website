Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leaks

Hi Rogelio,

The leaks on the tranny look like drive flange seals. These can be replaced
without too much trouble if you remove the engine and tranny (I replaced
mine recently), but they usually don't leak much and shouldn't cause any
problems as long as you check the tranny fluid level regularly.

The valve cover leaks are also a minor nuisance.  You can fix this with
cheap cork gaskets and glue.

The engine itself looks pretty clean, as best I can see in the pictures. The
oil pump picture is a little out of focus. All those leaks look pretty
harmless, as long as you keep the fluids topped off.

I just changed the oil in &quot;La Vebe&quot; this weekend and I found some leaks that
I wasn't aware of.
I took some pictures and posted them at
http://photos.yahoo_dot_com/bc/palomera_arias/lst?.view=t&amp;.dir=/Vebe+Leaks.
I'm wondering how severe they might be and how urgent their fixture should
be.
