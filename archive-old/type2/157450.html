&gt; How did Mario manage to get away with so much of this crap before
&gt; finally get hauled in?

Well, the stuff on TS is one side of the story, though it appears that
Mario isn't all that great a guy.

The short version is that there was some questionable service paperwork
(possible forged signatures) that allowed a mechanic's lein to be placed
on a vehicle that Mario claimed he was owed money on.  Unfortunately, the
vehicle was not in Mario's possession when he got the lein, so it
magically disappeared from its owner's place and reappeared behind
Mario's chain link fence.  That's a no-no.

The owner managed, through the DMV and police, etc. to show that the
paperwork was falsified, so he got his car back.

Nobody has gone to jail, and considering that the crime was small-time
fraud it is unlikely that they will get a DA interested in pursuing the
case.

Still, miracles do happen, so it's interesting to watch the soap opera
continue...
