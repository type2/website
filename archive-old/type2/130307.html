Subject: 73 Westy 5-speed STILL For Sale

Ok, I've had my 73 Westy with Porsche 5-speed tranny and Porsche 914 2.0 FI
engine up for sale for a couple of months.  I've had a few e-mail inquiries
and several phone inquiries and even thought I had a deal nailed down twice,
but to date nobody has actually showed up with any money.

A few of you know this bus and know that when I say it's solid, not rusted,
and runs out like no other bus you've seen that I'm not exagerating.  I've
reduced the price from $4000 to $3300 and would still consider offers, but
nobody seems to be interested.  Am I asking too much?  Are people afraid of
the tranny conversion?  Are they afraid of the d-jet FI?  Any input or
suggestions as to why this bus is not selling would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Mike g.
