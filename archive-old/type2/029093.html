Sweet 1978 VW Camper Bus for sale. Clean and original. Great shape. Must
sell within two days. Email me at brett_at_pebblepublishing_dot_com for pictures.
Or call (573) 698-2009. Cash starved guidebook writer and his full time
student wife forced to sell clean 78 Volkswagen Westphalia Camper bus. They
don't come much cleaner than this. All my Westie buddies were jealous that I
found such a clean bus. Too bad we can't afford to keep her. Give this bus a
good home! Great all around bus. No restoration job here - just fire her up
and enjoy. Straight body. Good paint. No dings on bumpers. Has original good
running 2.0 with fuel injection working and intact. Just repainted white
bumpers and wheels. Good top (does have two patches), good glass, good
engine, good tires, good interior (except driver seat is worn through on one
edge). All interior camper accessories functional. New pump in kitchen sink.
Most of interior is immaculate. Cassette player/radio not working. Has aux.
heater blowers. We take this bus to N. Carolina 2-3 times a year. Other than
that she just gets driven easy highway miles. We don't push her. This
Westphalia is all in good to great condition. Runs good. Spent most of life
in New York Area. Has been in Missouri for two years. Within last three
years: added two new batteries, new ECU unit, right head replacement, FI
seals, runner hoses, clutch, engine mounts, exhaust, heater boxes, fuel
lines, RR wheel cylinder, belt, new tranny fluid, tune up, points,
condenser, exhaust manifold gaskets, brake cables, brake adjuster wheels,
brakes, hard start relay, new pop top seal and more... Beginning to show
some surface/spot rust in a few small places. Rusted through on back two
corners below tailights (about a U.S. quarter size of rust on one side, and
more like the size of a bottom of a Coke can on the other.) Floor and
bottom/track of sliding door are solid. I had a compression test done today.
Cylinder 1: 100; Cylinder 2: 135; Cylinder 3: 115, and Cylinder 4: 125.
Mechanic said that was normal. Said probably a little carbon build up since
we don't use it as a daily driver. And since this bus has self-adjusting
hydraulic lifters, no maintenance is required. He did suggest running real
good gas and using a fuel additive from time to time. Also, has full
curtains and all screens in great condition. But no child's cot. Located in
Rocheport, Missouri (www.rocheport_dot_com) right between Kansas City and St.
Louis right on I-70. (Two hours from either city).
