I feel better now having got that of my chest! Any how, I have rapped the 
exhaust headers, the pipes that lead to the heater control units and will 
finish of wrapping the heat exchangers when it gets a little warmer out side. 
The reason is to get more heat not more power. More heat from the heating 
system that is. I believe I saw this on an American web site, if somebody 
knows this site could the E.mail me. As the exhaust system is positively air 
cooled by the engine fan (type 4 engine) I cannot see heat build up being a 
problem. Also on my type 4 engined bus the air for the induction is drawn in 
from the front of the engine (fuel tank side) not the side vents on the van.
