&gt;&gt; Why not the '76 912 E?  Unlike the early model 912, which has basically
&gt;&gt; a 356 engine, the 912 E has a Type 4.  Parts should be much easier to
&gt;&gt; get for that one.

while i can certainly appreciate a 912 aesthetically, i don't think there is
much difference cost-wise in upkeep between an early 911 and any 912. engine
rebuild for a 911 is expensive, but so is it for a 912. main bearings for a
912 or 356 can run into the 400 dollar range. new valves cost about 100
each. you can easily spend 5k on parts alone to rebuild a 356 engine. resale
value for 911's is very good, and they are a snap to sell should you decide
to. you can't quite say the same for a 912. the 911 and 912 share the
majority of parts save the engine itself, and the performance of the 6 will
blow away either the 912 or 912E. the 356 is a different beast altogether
and the price of admission these days is steep.

my vote, if you are going porsche, is an early 911. i have given this some
thought, because since i finished restoring our VW Thing, i am looking for
the next project. it will be a 72 or 73 911 targa :-)
