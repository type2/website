I don't know if this applies to later vans, but I know that my '77 Westfalia
will squeak from the shock absorbers unless a &quot;star&quot; washer is used on them.
The shocks should come with the correct washer if truly specified for a VW
van.  The squeak is very annoying,

&gt; I am experiencing a squeak with identical symptoms in the right front
&gt; wheel. I have removed and greased the bearings but to no avail. The bearings
&gt; and races look good. Anybody have any suggestions?
