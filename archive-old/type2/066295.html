&gt;Beowolf becomes old, infirm and feeble-minded.  In the end, the people stone
&gt;them to death.
&gt;The instant I saw the name 'Grendel,' proposed by a member of this list, I
&gt;recalled the Icelandic version of the saga and realized there could be no
&gt;name more apt for the old bus.  And yes, I am growing old and feeble-minded
&gt;even as she is becoming young and beautiful :-)

        I suspect you might even be able to find some volunteers for the
stoning if you look around a while...   ;-) ;-)

Peace,
