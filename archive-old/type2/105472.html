&gt; &gt; Yes, I have remembered that part of bus driving.  Hence my desire to move

&gt;I don't think VW had that add-on in mind when they did their crash testing
&gt;because the body will deform before the bumper can absorb the impact. The
&gt;Euro models had the extended bumper for the tire carrier for a reason: with
&gt;the tire mounted you increase your chance of nose damage if someone
&gt;accidentally backs into you.

As opposed to what?  Having some SUV just back into the nose itself?

I had a little girl pull out right in front of me on a state highway, when 
I was driving
my Thing(tm).  If it were not for the spare tire on the front, and another 
on top of
the hood, rather than just having part of the steering column go under my 
kneecap,
I'd have most likely had the leg removed.

I keep my spare on the front of the bus.

I also broke the windshield with my face.  Twice.  So if your &quot;old&quot; car 
didn't come stock
with shoulder belts.  INSTALL SOME FOR GAWD'S SAKES!!  There's been one or
two actual improvements, in automobiles, since the early sixties, and 
that's one of 'em.
