Does any one know if sportsmobiles came with some sort of manual or instuction sheet.I have a 72 and was just wondering what it looked like on the inside when it was riged for camping.I have tried to contact the company but they have been sold and moved and the current owners never were involved with the use of VWs.Thanks,Tim Linke-72 Frankenbus
