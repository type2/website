Subject: RE: [T2] Back door cargo rubber ?

&gt; Pardon me for dispensing unwanted advice.  But I'm gonna do it
&gt; anyway.  I'm sure that you can find some low prices for that seal.
&gt; But remember that low prices often go hand-in-hand with low quality.
&gt; Your best price for a good seal will most likely be found by
&gt; doing a little talking to Ron Salmon.  There's too much to risk here
&gt; just for the sake of the lowest price.


Most of the aftermarket seals I've seen come out of Mexico, and are
noticably inferior to the original in both fit and quality. When I could get
them, I sold them for $39 and was very up-front about the fact that they
were not OEM quality. They were a step above a ripped up old seal but a
noticable step below the correct one.  I have not had stock on these for
some time, as the distributor in Mexico who had them cheap went bankrupt,
and at a higher price they just weren't worth the money.  I have seen them
elsewhere for as high as $75, which is far more than they're worth.

I do currently sell OEM quality ones, for $79.95 with listmember discount.
I can get a couple different versions of this.  One is genuine VW. Some
vendors list it as German, or even N.O.S.   It is not.  For years, VW has
been sourcing these from their factory in Brazil, and then putting them in
boxes labeled VW/Germany, VW/Mexico, or VW/Brazil depending on where it was
distributed.  But in neither case is it actually German made. (This is not
common knowledge, however, so I don't think anyone who calls the seal German
is intentionally deceiving.)  That said, it is still a good seal, virtually
identical to the original German one.  The corners are proper and the fit is
good.  Some of the older ones (from a couple of years ago; still found at
retail) were cosmetically a bit odd, as they are made of three glued
sections and one section was a different color from the other two.  I
suspect that VW was running through some old stock of rubber when they
assembled these particular seals. The ones I have seen more recently (and
have in stock) do not exhibit this cosmetic flaw; all three glued sections
are the same color.

The other higher-quality one is a nicely made European made aftermarket
version, which I import myself right from Europe when I can get it.  It is
an excellent reproduction of the original seal, nearly identical to the
Brazilian one but a bit darker in color. I have found it to be of equal
quality to the Brazilian one, and tend to ship either interchangeably
depending on availability.

So in either case, $79.95 gets you the best available quality.  Our part #
