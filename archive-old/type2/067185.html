Subject: RE: Hints on engine removal, '77 westy

Having just removed and installed my '77 westy's engine I have a few tips.
The manual I used foremost was Tom Wilson's &quot;How to Rebuild your Aircooled
VW&quot;  It is a great source and reasonably priced.  Secondly I used the Bently
manual.  A distant third was Muir (Admittedly a great reference but I find it
more useful for troubleshooting).
I used ramps to jack my car up with.  It worked great and gave a stable
set up to climb around under the bus.
Label all wires and hoses (there are actually less of them than I expected)
If you plan on removing the heads (for any reason) remove the exhaust system
before you drop the engine (it is a pain to get it off with the engine sitting
on the floor, I know!!)
Replace the clutch disk, pressure plate, throw out bearing, and pilot bearing.
Work slow (it took me forever to complete the project, ~2 months)
You should easily be able to drop the engine in one day.
Watch the fuel lines by the injectors when installing the engine.
Overall, it is pretty easy and you will learn so much about your bus in the
process.
Good luck and have fun,
Brett

I did all of the above when replacing the engine on my '79 bus last year about 
this time, except:

Like a baboso, I didn't mark the wires or hoses, so it took a couple of extra 
days and lots of studying the Bentley and Haynes manuals (in the cold) to 
figure out where everything went.  Even then, I got stuck on reinstalling some 
of the FI stuff.  Fortunately, my son, who knows almost nothing about fixing 
cars and such, but was desperate to hit the sunny shores of Mexico, figured it 
out for me.

We also backed the bus onto ramps and used a $70 (on sale) large floor jack to 
remove the engine and tranny as a unit.  It came out smooth as a large molar 
(while on plenty of nitrous oxide).

I also replaced all the fuel lines and clamped them.

And yes, it's lots easier to remove/replace the exhaust system with the 
motor/tranny in the bus.

BTW, the original tranny and '79 2.0 engine are for sale.  Both worked fine 
when I replaced them, I just wanted to have a &quot;new&quot; bus.  A couple of the  
hydraulic lifters in the engine were developing clicking noises and need to be 
disassembled and cleaned or replaced.  They came from a one-owner '79 bus with 
135,000 miles.  I could use the money to spend a couple of months in 
Mexico/Central America this winter.  (rdr_at_arn_dot_net)
