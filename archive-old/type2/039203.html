Subject: Re: Quick Question about fan housings... (fwd)

John,

All the T4 fan housings for the '72-79 buses swap just fine.  Vanagon
shrouds are different, tho, so avoid them.

The hamster getting lost is a serious problem, tho :-)  You talk about
hard to find!!! Those suckers are absolutely impossible!  NOS ones are
very rare and it appears that this is one of those parts that ages whether
you install it or not.  The number of original 30-year-old German hamsters
that are still capable of maintaining 4,00RPM for hours on end is pretty
negligible.  The aftermarket rodents I have seen just don't have the
necessary speed... they tend to get shredded rather quickly.  And whatever
you do, stay away from the mexican and brazilian ones!!!  Capybaras
are just too damn big!  They use different jigs to make those suckers and
just will not fit without significant biological engineering or fan
re-design.
