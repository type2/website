Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Windshield in Northern VA?


Dick sold me a cherry passenger door complete for $50 a rear cargo door
also cherry for $20, perfect rear table for my 78' for $20 and a mint set
of front seats from a vanagon for $100. I thought I got a pretty good deal?

I
&gt; have been to a place in Jessup, MD called Crazy Rays they had 2 or 3
fairly
&gt; well picked vanagons, but I think they still had all glass. Crazy Rays is
&gt; also located in Baltimore on Erdman ave. They run a bring your own tools
&gt; joint. Absolutely the best prices I've ever seen, if they have you need.

and an unbelievable turnover, things aren't there long before they get
crushed.  if it isn't there comeback next week

&gt; I also know a guy on the eastern shore Dick Potter he has loads of bays,
a
&gt; few vanagons, and lots of aircooled stuff. I'm certain he would have the
&gt; glass but you have to go out there on a weekday as he is not open on
&gt; weekends. Try calling 410-827-6501 ask for Dick.

and he is a bit pricy
