Subject: Hydraulic lifter cams

        My understanding, from other 914 owners with hydraulic
lifters, is that the hydraulic lifter cam is MORE agressive than
the 'normal' cam. Could this be because the hydraulic lifter has
a slight amount of mechanical give and the extra-savage cam w/
hydraulic lifters produces the same valve movement as a normal
cam with normal lifters.
