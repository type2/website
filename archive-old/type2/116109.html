&gt; How far down does the filler pipe go? Could gas in the tank flow out of it
&gt; when I disconnect it? Unlikely, but I thought I'd ask. I've never removed
&gt; the firewall - this is just getting more fun by the minute.

More likely it's leaking from the short hose that connects the pipe to the
tank behind the firewall. Either that, or its coming out the breather system
behind the spare tire well on the driver's side.
