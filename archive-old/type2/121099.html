Subject: filtering for list mail using omnipresent [T2]

Relating to the compaint of wrong clocks putting mail at the bottom: to
please both the complainers (R.A. et al) and listee (J.T.) dealing with
date-sensitive software-
Sort of ontopic as it relates to listmail-
Granted, if default &quot;sort by date&quot; is used by mail reader, mail from
those with a wrong clock ends up at the top or at the bottom (a fav
spammer trick)....Due to all the spam, I created a folder for just type
2 mail, noting that all T2 mail has [T2] in it-	then set a filter for
[T2] and while downloading it sends all mail with that in subject or
body to that folder.  I do this with other lists also.  I use Netscape,
but believe other programs can sort and filter. You could sort your mail
by sender also.
