Subject: New 1600 Head Pics and Related Questions

Hi,

I've posted up some pics of my new head:

http://pg.photos.yahoo_dot_com/ph/julesherr/my_photos

I have a few concerns with this new head.

First, one of the two of the spark plug threads has some damage. This
is visible in pic

http://pg.photos.yahoo_dot_com/ph/julesherr/detail?.dir=305f&amp;.dnm=75d7re2.jpg

The inner-most thread has a V shaped notch cut out.  Also in this pic
you can see some stamping around the outer edge of the valve on the
head assembly. I don't know from what or why this stamping exists. I
can however see that these stamps have cause a small ridge of metal to
pull away from the head toward the valve. I'm hoping a pic is worth a
thousand words and someone knowledgeable can offer some insight.

Also, a few months back I asked how you could identify sodium filled
valves, and I got a response indicating that &quot;Normally the only way to
tell if to look at the face of the valve for a circule depression in
the center.&quot;

From looking at the pics, could someone tell me if it looks like
sodium filled valves or not?

I'm really looking forward to getting my bus fixed up. I could drive
it right now with a stretching (stretched) valve, but I don't want to
cause any permanent damage. Likewise, I don't want to rush into
installing a part that might give me trouble down the road. So if this
part isn't up to spec I'd like to know. Just need a trained eye.

Thanks
peace
jules
