&gt; Replace your flexible brake lines!!!!

   I add a hearty second to that. I've just spent a few hours on my '69 Bug.
Symptoms: seemed sluggish. Got curious, touched the drums after an 8 mile round
trip to town. Rears hot, fronts cool. Previous discussions on this list lead me to
believe the flex lines had collapsed internally. Confirmed diagnosis by watching
shoes (after drum removal) while daughter hit the brakes. Shoes moved almost
imperceptably, did not retract when brakes were off. Sent wife and daughter on mad
dash to FLAPS, 35 miles away, an hour before closing (1:00 on Saturdays). Wife
called at 12:45 saying parts were in hand. Then they went to the malls etc.
   Started replacement this morning. Here's what I found. Both rear flex hoses
were so stopped up I couldn't blow through them with 125 psi compressed air. Shoes
worn weirdly on right rear, cylinder leaking slightly. Arrgghh!
   Wife's shopping list for tomorrow (she passes right by FLAPS on way to/from
work): pair of flex hoses for front, four wheel cylinders, master cylinder, full
set of shoes front and rear and four brake spring/other doohickeys kits.
   From the looks of things those flex hoses were on since the beastie left
Wolfsburg 32 years and 190,000 miles ago. I'm assuming the fronts are going to
fail soon, so I'm just replacing everything so I'll have a reference point.
   Safety is the issue here. Busses weigh twice as much as Bugs, so there's even
more incentive to get things right. (That, and Busses have even less &quot;crush space&quot;
than Bugs, though part of the &quot;crush space&quot; on a Bug is 10 gallons of gasoline.)
   In any event, the relatively few bucks you'll spend on getting your braking
system in top order is far cheaper than an emergency room visit or a funeral.

Be careful out there.
