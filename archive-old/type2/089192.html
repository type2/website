Subject: Re: [T2] Nice California Westy

'Late' Westy as in 74/75 deluxe Westy only.
It went under the sink unit, which was behind the drivers seat. This was USA
models.

Mercedes offers this collapsible spare in the SLK. It is 15'' though...
And it is over $200..... that is for the tire and wheel assembly. Same 5 x 112
bolt pattern.

&gt; &gt;someone please explain how you &quot;fold&quot; a spare tire... i am very
&gt; &gt;confused... ok, so that isnt hard, but i cant imagine a usable tire being
&gt; &gt;folded up...
&gt;
&gt; Imagine a tire with very soft sidewalls. When you let the air out of the
&gt; tire, the diameter shrinks until the tire tread is nearly the same
&gt; circumference as the steel wheel and the sidewalls tuck towards the center
&gt; of the space normally occupied by air.
&gt;
&gt; So the tire &quot;folds&quot; up.
&gt;
&gt; Look for the late baywindow owners manual online (vintage bus?) and there
&gt; is a pic of this tire being inflated.
&gt;
&gt; The vans which got these tires also got an air compressor that would pump
&gt; up the tire when you needed it.
&gt;
&gt; Never seen the VW version but I do recall a couple of domestic spare tires
like this.
