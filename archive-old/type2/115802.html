&gt; Anyway, I went to the link that Richard provided and I loved that
&gt; diagram that he has posted on the ventilation system.  Does anybody
&gt; know what that T connector in that diagram labeled as 15A is called
&gt; ?  or the VW part number for it maybe?  I've got two buses of the
&gt; same year and that part is cracking on both.

I believe that particular tee is for 78 and up busses. In the rest of the
diagram which I clipped there is another connector for earlier models and it
was unavailable for a long time but now reproductions are available.

Bus Depot and others show 211-201-405 as 72-77 t-fitting.

&gt; I was wondering what part 6A is.  Fill collar, maybe?

It looks like the 67 and earlier fill collar doesn't it? Hmmm.
