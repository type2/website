Subject: Re: [T2] Pheonix/Tempe/Greg

You don't have to drive to GC or Death Valley to
see some nice scenery.  

Canyon/Roosevelt Lake/Tortilla Flats is a short
drive from Tempe, probably an 1 hour.  Tonto NF
is in the same area but a little farther
northeast.  Lotsa really nice views there.  I
would definitely do that area one day.  There is
also an old western town on Apache Trail that is
amusing for an hour or two.  

For desert scenery, Cabeza Prieta/Organ Pipe NF
are about 2-3 hours south of Phoenix.  Excellent
viewing.  On OP, take Ajo Mountain Loop to Estes
Canyon or the Arch.  On CP, go to Charley Bell
Pass.  You'll need something with high clearance,
but not necessarily 4wd for Cabeza.  




Happy bussin'
