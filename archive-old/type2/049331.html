sounds like you may have a bad valve.  It would account for the smoke, and
the noises.  You probably expect the same thing.  I wouldn't run it until a
pro can inspect the valves under the cover, and run a compression test.
Blue smoke usually means burned oil, which is what happens if you valve
guide goes bad, if a valve siezes up, or if you drop a valve.

I'm thinking its likely you need a new or rebuilt head.

As for the leak -- consider how old your fuel lines are.  If they are old,
maybe they need replacing.

I suspect the two problems are unrelated.

Hi!  This is Karen of &quot;Landon and Karen&quot;.  Landon is off blowing his money
in Vegas, and I'm here at home with a BIG, and potentially HUGE problem!!!

Here's the story.  Friday night I took Landon to the airport.  When I
dropped him off, I noticed there was a larger-than-usual amount of smoke
coming out of the bus (Russ, the '72 Westy).  Landon didn't seem to think
anything of it, so I didn't either.  The next day I was out again, and
noticed it again, and this time it scared me.  So, being the &quot;mechanic&quot; I
am, I thought maybe I shouldn't drive it any more until I figured out what
the problem was.  A very minor look was all it took - the left valve cover
gasket was leaking on to the heater boxes, and POOF!!!  Lots of smoke.  So,
congratulating myself for recommending that Landon buy spares last time we
were out, I went ahead and replaced it, this time gluing it in with 3M
weatherstrip adhesive (probably against Landon's will - sorry, Landon).  I
checked the oil and added about a quart.  I then ran the bus for about 10
minutes to make sure that the seal held, which it did, then went inside to
watch some quality television.

About an hour later, I decided that TV sucks and rots your brain, so I
thought I'd go shopping (a much healthier alternative, right?).  I got in
the bus, tried to turn him over, but all it did was go &quot;CrrChunk!&quot;  I ran
through the usual checks - battery seemed fine, it had gas, and it sounded
like the starter was *trying* to work, but like THE ENGINE WAS NOT
TURNING!!!  It was cold and dark, and I knew I couldn't do anything then, so
I told myself it was just one of those VW PMS things, and that it would be
fine in the morning, and went back to rotting my brain.

So, this morning I got up.  Decided to give it one more try.  Same thing.
CrrChunk!!!  So, I thought, hmmmm...  I'm going to try to hand turn the
engine....  I could turn it backwards just fine, but it would not turn
forwards past a certain point.  I couln't tell exactly where I was in the
cylindar cycle, but I was not at TDC anything.

So as I'm looking at this, I notice that there is a large puddle of
something underneath the engine, that smells remarkably like gasoline.  So I
look up a few degrees, and notice gasoline dripping from the right
carborator.  At a rate of about a drip a second.  And we're parked about 2
feet from the sidewalk, and someone could flick a cigarette right into that
puddle with little or no effort.

I called a few mechanics I know but no one was answering at 8:30 on Sunday
morning, so I called Landon in Vegas.  He grogilly said to use a pair of
vice grips to cut off the fuel line into the carb.  So I did.  But it kept
dripping.  So I put another pair of vice grips on the line coming into the
top of the carborator (I don't actually know what it was, but it looked like
a vacuum line.  I was just trying to get something to work).  After about 15
minutes of screwing around trying to figure out where exactly it was
leaking, it finally slowed down, and then stopped.

I really can't tell where the leak is coming from.  The drips are coming off
the bottom of the idle adjusting rod thing right in the front of the carb,
as you're looking at it from the rear engine compartment (we don't have one
of those luxurious top hatches).  There is a little nut that holds the
rocker assembly in place.  it appears to be coming from somewhere near
there, but I just can't tell for sure.

A few months ago, we replaced the fuel pump with an electrical one.  The
very next day, we had a similar problem in the same right carb.  Landon took
it in, and the needle valve had blown, but they said that the electrical
fuel pump was fine, that the pressure was not too high.  But it seemed then
like it was leaking from a different area of the carb.  Any ideas???

So after the gas stopped leaking, I went back to look at the engine.  For
some reason I could get it to turn now, but when I reached that same point,
I heard a chattering sound, like air/liquid trying to escape.  I backed it
off and did it again.  Same sound.  In the many hours I've spent turning the
engine while Landon adjusts and readjusts the valves, I've never heard this
sound.  It was coming from the left side of the engine, and I'm pretty sure
from valve/cylindar #3, but I don't know where in the system.

So, if anyone has any ideas of what's wrong, I would love to have some grasp
on this problem before Landon comes home tomorrow morning, broke, hungover,
and potentially mad at me for breaking his bus.

Thanks!!!  Sorry for the extreme length, but I tend to ramble when I'm
scared.

On a good note, though, at least it wasn't raining!!!  I'm in Seattle for
god's sake!!!!!  ;)

Karen
