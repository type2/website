Hi Jon,

In my experience it is that it worth the extra cost to run high octane gas  
in a type 1 engine.  First, at about 7.6 to 1 our engines aren't all that  
low compression, and some builders deliberately lower the compression to  
6.9 to 1 make them more compatible with regular gas.

But equally important is this:  our engines can and do sometimes run hot.   
Try driving the mountains on a broiling summer's day.  Doesn't matter how  
good your tin, you're gonna run hot.  A hot engine triggers pre-ignition.   
Pre-ignition not only is not good for your engine but also causes an  
immediate loss of power. The natural instinct then is to give the engine  
even more gas to make it to the top of that hill.  The result is a  
reinforcing cycle of an even hotter engine and worse pre-ignition.

The difference between low octane and high octane fuel is that higher  
octane gas burns more slowly so it handles pre-ignition better.  In  
addition, because of that, using 91 or 92 octane gas lets you safely  
advance the timing a few degrees, increasing highway performance and fuel  
economy.  So the difference in the cost of running high octane gasoline is  
less than it may at first seem judging by pump prices alone.

Cheers,

John R
