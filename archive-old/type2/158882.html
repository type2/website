Subject: Re: [T2] Weber progressive jetting

Chai,
Your jets are in the ballpark for a 32/36 on either 1.8 or 2.0 liter and definitely not too far on the rich side.  at any rate you can burn a lot of gas with the progressive especially around town in stop-and-go.  After double-checking timing and dwell, lean out your idle mixture screw counter-clockwise 1/4 turn at a time then test-drive and see if it doesn't die on you, tune for &quot;lean best running idle.&quot;  You might get by with a 55 main idle jet then you would have to back out the screw again.  I wouldn't go leaner on any of the others BUT hint--there is an &quot;extra enrichment passage&quot; that can be plugged in the secondary to limit wasting fuel there, then you figure out a bigger sec. main (~165-170) to compensate. . . leave your other jets as you have them for VW:

no flames please. . . 

I might have a few of these jets laying around. . . just give me a call.

&gt;Main 135 140
&gt;Idle 60 50
&gt;Air Corr 170 180

 &gt; that was sent to me awhile back...
 &gt; anyone have a good idea what the best jets would be to use on a weber 32/36 
&gt;defv....1800 engine~!~ 76 transporter...and is this setup above the best so that i 
&gt;got something to go by?
   
&gt;  not sure my jets are right ,? not sure they are wrong but i do use alot of gas it 
&gt;seems.. dont know if that measn thare are to big or even if the gas consumption is 
&gt; coming from jets....and not something else....
