Subject: Re: Tire Carriers and 'Bull' bars

Robert,

I am VERY interested in a 'bull' bar.

I've been trying to figure out how to get one for some time.

The last time I visited &quot;Nice VW Bus Page&quot;, there was a very nice jpg of a
Westfalia with a bull bar w/spare tire, Hella fog lamps and a device to
protect the windshield from stones.

The following is the web site's address:

Best regards,

Michael

&gt; Back home down under (where women roar and men chunder) it is reasonably
&gt; common  to fit a light 'bull' bar to your bus.  This is a device made
from
&gt; 2&quot; steel pipe (about 1/4&quot; wall thickness).  Imagine a piece of pipe which
&gt; attaches to the longtiudinal chassis rail, runs out just past the bumper,
&gt; bends upwards at 90 degrees (vertical to ground) has another 90 degree
bend
&gt; (horizontal to ground) runs across the front of the bus, and then back
down
&gt; to connect to the other longitudinal rail.  Then has another two
horizontal
&gt; pieces which extend past these verticals to protect the headlights, which
&gt; are also gently bent back to floow the contour of the nose.....

&gt; Hmmm..so much for ascii art but I hope you get the idea....
&gt; 
&gt; Spare wheels are commonly attached to the bull bar, rather than to the
&gt; panels on the front of the bus....also very handy for protecting that
&gt; precious nose from  hits....they are actually not as butt ugly as you
might
&gt; think (based on certain ascii art renditions anyway) when properly
finished
&gt; with curves etc.....and of course, they unbolt reasonably quickly...
&gt; 
&gt; Never seen anything like this here in the States.....would there be a
&gt; market for this type of thing or are you all reeling in horror at the
very
&gt; thought?  Or (maybe) there could be legislation which prohibits them?
&gt; (hazard to pedestrians or similar?). If anyone is interested I could try
&gt; and find a pic of a bus thus equipped........
