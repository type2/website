&gt;&gt; HowEVah! And I just learned this: The handle on my 73 goes on a square
&gt;&gt; shank that is tapped in the center. The shank on my 69 (and, I just
&gt;&gt; learned, Mike's 71) is a different shape, to wit:

&gt;&gt; Steve calls it castellated. Did this change occur in 72 or 73?
&gt;
&gt;Ha Ha!
&gt;Remove the screw and remove the piece off the square shaft. What you have is
&gt;what is left after the plastic handle breaks off!
&gt;
You're right, Karl and there has been some illuminating p-mail to that
effect including some quips from the backstage sliding-handle wizard
Steve Dolan. In fact, I shot another photo after removing hearing from
him or the suspect leftover piece which is visible at:

I'll jump on the list with this info insofar as Steve is at the beach,
Nikki is prolly in a junkyard, and I am in the last bit of twilight
here in the Eastern zone--the lone typist able to admit this mystery
has been officially solved.

Thanks for jumping in. Cheers to you and those silent lurkers who may
be reading along!
