Subject: Re: Regular vs Premium

All,

Geez, next to oil preferences, this is probably the
oldest FART (Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Thread;-)
around.

A quick check of the archives reveals that the
European method of measuring octane is different than
in the U.S., so the 91-RON rating on the inside of the
fuel cap is meaningless unless converted to U.S.
standards.


I too, have run regular un-leaded, plus, and premium
in my bus, but I've not noticed one lick of difference
between the 3. I'll run regular and pocket the change
for my next motor, thank you very much;-)

&gt; as far as i know, premium is better for our vans.
&gt; they were designed with
&gt; something like 91 octane in mind (i think that s
&gt; what it says on the inside of
&gt; my gas cap flap =). and premium is 92 (?), whereas
&gt; the others are 89 and 87
&gt; (?). but really, i don t know all that much about
&gt; this, i m hoping someone will
&gt; correct me if need be (good chance =) hope everyone
&gt; had a good thanksgiving!
