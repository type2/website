Subject: Re: smoking light switch

&gt; From: &quot;Casey Lohrman&quot; &lt;thebigfudge_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; On my way home today I hit a tunnel and turned on my lights, a coupple min. 
&gt; later I smelled and then saw some smoke comming out of the area surrounding 
&gt; the light switch.

&gt; Has anybody had this happen before, or know what it might be?

--&gt; When it happened to me, it was the dimmer element in the headlight
switch.  There's a coil of thin wire in there, that a wiper on the shaft
contacts.  This is how you can adjust the brightness of your dash lights.
On mine, the coil broke and shorted to the case of the switch, causing it
to get very hot.  (The wire, not the case.)  If your dash lights have been
erratic at any position other than full bright, this is why.  The fix
would be to replace the headlight switch.
