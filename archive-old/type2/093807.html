&gt;so i pulled the round access hole in the engine compartment to try to get

&gt;going to work, or if you know it will, when i get home tonight i am going 
&gt;to try and take the plate that hides the gas tank off, with out pulling 
&gt;the engine mind you, to try to get enough arm back in there to take that 
&gt;hose off and replace it, plus, hiding back there is another tiny piece of 
&gt;hose on the expansion tube, that isn't going to be easy to replace.

I wish you luck with this. This is a really awkard place, with the engine OUT and you sitting inside the engine compartment!  It entails a lot of twisting of rubber and metal tube ends to seat everything just right if you do manage to get it undone.
