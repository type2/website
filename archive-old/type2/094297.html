&gt; on the list recommend and replaced all the fuel lines in the bus when I put
&gt; it all back together, or so I thought! I have recently been getting strong
&gt; fuel smells from the engine bay, and it has taken a while to find the
&gt; problem (and quite nerve racking). One joint I over looked in the tank
&gt; breather system (2.0L carb '77 bus) that is easily missed is behind the
&gt; spare wheel carrier. The steel tubes there are hidden, but there is a joint
&gt; there. Make sure you look for this one too!!!!

Even if the breather system has recently been inspected it's not worthwhile
to overfill the tank.  Carry a 2 gal spare instead.  Once you look behind
the firewall it's obvious that overfilling the tank won't really get you
much further down the road.

Is it possible that fuel could be forced through the breather lines, through
the charcoal canister and onto cylinder #2?  I wonder.

&gt; With my
&gt; recent leak I had raw fuel collecting in the battery tray (luckily not on
&gt; the hot engine) on the left side of my bus when I filled the tank, but
&gt; LUCKILY it never ignited. I would have taken only on little spark from a bad
&gt; terminal and no more bus!

Do people still put petroleum jelly onto battery terminals?
