Subject: N Calif. Van (Loaf) for sal

Here's EVERYTHING I know about this vehicle:

Location - parked on the curb on Fair Oaks Ave. Sunnyvale Ca.

Price - $900 marked on front windshield

Phone # - (408) 771-0751

Has CA plates, didn't notice if current '96 registration sticker on rear plate
Plate # 342THJ, CA yellow letters on blue.

Color - Basic white (oxidized) with green and mango stripes/pattern??

Wheels &amp;  Tires - yeuup! it has 4 aftermarket &quot;Mag&quot; wheels and tires that are
not flat.

Interior - Some curtains, louvered windows on sliding door and opposite
sliding door, 2 front seats, sink no middle seat, rear bench seat, cupboard in
left rear quarter, some curtains (mango color?)

Physical appearances - fair to good???  Body has no obvious damages other than
what I'd expect from a van this age, not immediately obvious gross damage or
wear to exterior, interior, or dash that I could see from a brief walk past
it.  No visabily apparent rust, bent body parts etc. Coupla broken side marker
lenses/assemblies, limited to plastic, no apparent body damage.  All glass
appeared intact. Had front (and I think rear) bumper intact, missing rubber
insert.  

Mechanical?? Other than the fact that it says &quot;Unleaded gas only&quot; on the gas
filler port, no idea.  Does it run, is the tranny good,   Who knows????
Does it burn/blow  oil, pass smog, knock, clack, thump or ping???? Didn't look
in engine compartment.

Harvey
