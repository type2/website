Adam,
	You will need one of the Bentley VW manuals with a correct wiring
diagram for your year of bus to get started on this project... 'cause
you are going to end up chasing just about every wire and finding where
it is supposed to go before you get this all fixed up... it's a hassle,
but it will really give you some good experience in how to go about
diagnosing problems with wiring systems. I was able to scrape by several
times with the diagram in a miscellaneous Chilton's text, after
realizing that the fuse block was the reverse of the diagram that I was
looking at directly in the book. Still... Bentley is better.
	The reverse lights (when they are in an uncorrupted situation)... use
power from the positive side of the coil (terminal 15, as marked on the
coil). When the power wire for the reverse lights is hooked up to the
*negative* side (terminal 1 on the coil), incorrectly, and the tranny is
put in reverse, then the negative side becomes constantly
grounded-out... the coil then cannot build a charge up to fire the
plugs, and the engine won't run.
	You will need to go through your entire wiring system, more than
likely, to make sure in your mind that it matches the wiring diagram
perfectly... replacing deteriorated push-on connectors with new ones,
and using a bit of 3M shrink-tubing to make it all nice, *after* you
have soldered the wires to their connectors. 
	I have seen many McGyvered jobs where people have twisted wires
together and taped them together with electrical tape... and masking,
duct, or scotch varieties... whatever they had within arm's reach.
	Automotive-variety crimp-on (i.e. solderless) wiring connectors will
eventually work loose and provide poor connections. I crimp them on
after removing the plastic &quot;jackets&quot; that they were made with, since I
haven't hunted down a good local source for the bare ones yet. Soldering
ensures that you will have a good connection for a looooong time. The 3M
shrink-tubing defends against the wires breaking at the point where they
are soldered to the connectors, which will happen if not dealt with...
This extra protection isn't as important for a lamp or other stationary
object, but will create problems if not done in an antique vehicle that
vibrates and bounces its way down the road for hours on end. 
	A used bus is more often than not someone's galvanizing experience
waiting to happen... It will (given enough time) teach you more than you
possibly could have imagined and proof-test your patience and skill
levels at the same time. ...think I'll quit here before i venture into
cliche-land, the possibility hovering ominously nearby...

happy diagnosing...
