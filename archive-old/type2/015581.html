&gt;Sorry if my answer was perplexing, but some manuals built in the 60-70's
came full
&gt;of ATF from the factories. (NOT VW'S) I was surprised when I first saw
this, but
&gt;found it was specced by the factory!

Indeed, both Mercedes and Volvo manual trannys of the 70's and earlier used
ATF as spec. ATF is an excellant general purpose solvent. Very good for
cleaning carb bodies among other things. I have used it as a motor flush
for heavy varnish buildup. I use it to flush out the last of very dirty
lube in trannys and differentials.
