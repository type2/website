Subject: Re: [T2] `71 BUS MASTER CYLINDER CONVERSION HELP!

I am replacing all brake stuff on my '72.  My vacuum servo is also bad.
However, it will stop with a failed servo, it does have a failsafe mode,
just plug the vacuum line to it so the engine runs well.

I have sent my servo to H&amp;R rebuilders in Dallas to get rebuilt.  I expect
it to cost me about $100.  I like thinks to work like they are supposed to,
especially my brakes.  I safety is worth this investment, especially when
there is only about 0.093&quot; of steel between my knees and all those SUV's
that are in front of me.

&gt; We have a `71 bus here, picked it up free.  We have her running and
&gt; ready to drive.  She is kinda rough hit in nose soem rust but still not
&gt; worth scraping.  All works fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Brakes are as follows...original drums in rear. The front end is off a
&gt; `73 bus disc brakes.  Bus has Power brakes set up. Bus has been sitting
&gt; for 5 years brakes are shot.  I can get the rear cylinders cheap and the
&gt; front calipers rebuilt fairly cheap.
&gt; 
&gt; I dug into the Master cylinder and she is junk...also noticed vaccum
&gt; leak and found it is the servo in front of the Master cylinder so she is
&gt; junk too.  New servo is $150+ and master cylinder is $40...to pricely
&gt; for this old junker...we just wanna drive her as a sceond beater truck.
&gt; Noticed that you could get this bus withOUT power brakes...problem is
&gt; that Master cylinder is $135!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Here is my question and idea...I see there is a bracket already in place
&gt; on the bus for the NON power master cylinder. This looks identical to
&gt; the bracket on my `65 bus.  Master cylinder for that bus is
&gt; cheap...single curcit unit but works great!  $29 I think !  Anyhow...she
&gt; will mount right up to the existing bracket....and I can fab the correct
&gt; push rod and cut an access hole for the resevoir.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow...my question IS can I use this earlier bus Master culinder in
&gt; conjuction with the disc brakes in front and rear drums in
&gt; back...basically stock?  I would assume this would work fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody donw this...hints bad points.._dot_can it be done or not...
&gt; 
&gt; Our #1 priority on this bus is cheap...it is whooped and we just wanna
&gt; get her driving.  Thanks for your help!
