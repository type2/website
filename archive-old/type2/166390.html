Subject: Oil pressure gauge twitches - youtube video clip.

Hi Volks,

Just thought I'd ask for an opinion on the behaviour of the oil  
pressure gauge, I've never seen this happen before. Apologies to  
those on dial-up.

http://www.youtube_dot_com/watch?v=zD90R961lhw

Details:
Rebuilt engine with VERY LOW miles but many years sitting.
Fresh 20W50 oil and filter.
Was running 65-70 MPH when video was made.
head temps nice and low, engine bay cool.

I'd like to think the 20W50 is triggering the pressure bypass switch  
and there's nothing to worry about. But if there is something to  
worry about, I want to know about it before the 800 mile trip to HCBF  
at the end of the month.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
