You might want to verify that it is in fact that large of an upright. If 
it is that large it is either a stroker, or much larger pistons than 
stock (1600cc). The advice you receive will depend on if this engine is 
a hi performance engine or just a run of the mill engine.

&gt; My question is when driving into the mountains upto 6000' what can I
&gt; expect?

Well If you drive up the mountain expect Mt. Hood to be beautiful ;) The 
largest thing I would pass along is to be patient. What will cause 
problems is trying to push the bus too much uphill and causing excess 
heat to build up. This is what will cause pinging. Enjoy.
