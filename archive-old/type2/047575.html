What Andrew says below is absolutely true. You don't have to go through
all that to simply work on the brakes. Technically you can just
loosen and remove the wheel and drum as one unit and work on the brakes
that
way. You can also have a shop remove the wheel from the drum with an air
gun. My perspective is geared more toward giving you the ability to change
any future flat tires
yourself rather than rely on AAA or a shop.



&gt;All this sounds pretty drastic.  Why don't you drive down to your
&gt;friendly tire dealer and have him loosen them with his air impact
&gt;wrench.

&gt;Also, as I recall and it has been years, you don't have to remove the
&gt;tire to remove the rear brake drum on 71 or later bus.  Just remove
&gt;the large castellated nut and raise the wheel. The drum will come off
&gt;with the hub attached.
