Subject: temp sender location

Hi, 

I am getting ready to install oil temp and pressure senders on my 78
Westfalia. I scoured the archives and got an idea where they should go. I
got the extender and angle adapter to get the pressure sender to clear the
distributor and engine tin but the only drain plug temp sender the FLAPS had
was for a type 1 engine. They said I had to use the pressure sender T
adaptor to get a temp on a type 4 engine. It seems that there is not enough
oil flow there to get a good temp so I am hoping that a sender does in fact
exist for the drain plug. Otherwise, is there a way to adapt the type 1 plug
tmep sensor to a type 4? 

Any opinions and experiences out there?

Bob
