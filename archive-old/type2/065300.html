&gt;Thanks for the post, sounds like a nifty device, but at what price?
&gt;If its less than $10 , I might go for it. If it's expensive, then it 
&gt;is a lot for just-in-case you leave it switched to both.  I can't see 
&gt;switching to both, ever.  Start bus with one battery, charge it up, 
&gt;clutch in (while driving), turn ignition off and switch to other battery, 
&gt;turn ignition on (not start), release clutch, engine starts, charge 
&gt;up other battery.
&gt;The Zap-Stop product is interesting, but I would like further 
&gt;information.

Jeff, 

As I understand it the combiner &quot;combines&quot; the charging of the batteries
 -- there is still a switch to switch between the cranking battery and the 
&quot;house&quot; deep-cycle battery. 

As to price -- don't have the catalog here -- but it wasn't 10 bucks.
