Hi guys,

I've got a '79 Kombi with a Campmobile 70 interior out of a 73 automatic.
Its got a 2.0 liter with fuel infection and hydraulic lifters.

Since I bought it it has consumed much oil andand ran pretty loud after I
broke off that exhaust stud.  Compression test results were on here
earlier with #3 cylinder dead.  New spark plugs were installed gapped to
.028&quot;.  I had originally intended to remove exhaust remove replace broken
stud, clean up exhaust, replace valve cover gaskets and leaking push rod
tube seals on the right side.  Upon the discovery of cylinder #3 having
compression of 35 psi I decide &quot;screw the broken stud&quot; so I pu the exhaust
all back on with anti-sieze and new gaskets.  I replaced the valve cover
gaskets and pushrod seals hoping to stop that oil leak.  With everything
back in place I think.  Itry to start the bus.  It normally is hard to
start but this is ridiculous. One loud backfire--no startingg.  It finally
starts and is barely
running--really quiet.  That Harley Davidson sound is gone!  Great
however
I rev it a bit and it promptly dies after much trying it starts again and
now displays the systems of doing nothing when the accelerator
pedal is pushed but dying instead.  I look in the back and find I had
forgotten to reconnect the electrical piece to that air filter box.  Plug
that in.  Hope everything is solved. No. A little better now but not great
I figure I'll take a turn around the block.  Rev it a lot to keep it from
dying in driveway as I turn around.  Head up the street--going slow-but
going.  Shift in to second--bus dies--pull into lane. After a minute or
two of trying it starts again and promptly dies upon revving.  Turned it
around.  It died again. Drove back to my driveway and it died just as I
rolled in. Whats Wrong Now?!

I think cylinder #3 has been dead since I bought the bus two months ago
and I put 1500 miles on it before I found this out.  It ran Ok had decent
power...  So what is the problem now?

Questions.
1. Does fixing the terribly leaking exhaust magnify the problem in #3
resulting in this current state?

2.What is causing this unwillingness to run?

3. How can I fix it tonight?

I need to drive around for the next couple weeks and do about 700-800
miles before I have time to drop the engine.  When I drop it I plan to
replace the heads with two rebuilt AVP heads.  Should I do rings to?  Does
that mean cylinders have to be honed?  Any info is appreciated.

Is this realistic?  If I fix whatever is wrong now can I drive around on
three cylinders for two weeks?  I think I have bee for two months?  Is
that possible?

Thanks in Advance,
Dan Sweet

P.S.--Just went out and checked the spark plugs--#1 and #2 were both oil
covered.  1 and 2 ran 120 earlier when i did the compression test. Removed
valve cover to check my work on the seals from yesterday and 2 of the 4
bolts were sitting in the valve cover with the other two ready to come
off.  In my desire to get that little spring in I forget to tighen down
the bolts!  I fixed everything--reset spring and made sure tubes were
seated.  tightened bolts and re-sealed valve cover gaskets.  Pulled plugs
1 and 2 and cleaned off oil.  Figured everything should be fixed now.
Tried to start fired for a second and died tried more-flooded it-noluck.
	More Questions
1.  Is everything fixed?-Will it start eventually?Could oil somehow get
into the piston if the rocker arms were loose?  Did running with the loose
hurt anything?
2.  If you think something else is wrong or I need to do something else to
finish fixing the problem--what is that something?

Thanks for your patience.
