&gt; 
&gt; I think they have an 800 number and will respond to any question with either
&gt; the correct answer or point you in the appropriate direction.  They might
&gt; even have Westy rubber!!!

I think everything they sell is 1st quality. I bought some sunroof
cables for a 67 bug from them a while back and they were marked &quot;Golde&quot;,
obviously OEM! NLA from the dealer for  quite a while!
