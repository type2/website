Subject: Re: [T2] Mystery wire


&gt; Other question: do all brown wires with white stripe go to ground?  I have
&gt; one coming up from the corner by the fuse box.  No current running through
&gt; it.

Yes and no.
Solid brown is yes.
Brown with a tracer color is yes BUT it is going thru someting to get to ground,
i.e. a switch, a coil in a relay, etc.
Somewhere I saw a list of the tracer colors and what each one meant it was going
thru to get to ground. Hmmm, I gotta look for that.
