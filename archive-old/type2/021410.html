Subject: H. Steven Dolan was here!!

This is from -- uj --TWWM--   in Phoenix Arizona-- Steve arrived here in Phoenix about
10AM---Left at 9PM heading south to Tucson--changed oil as a possible cause of
overheating--Or maybe the 104+ heat of Phoenix might have had a little to do with it?--We
had lunch and dinner--Steve, Magoo, and uj--
As to what transpired in our garage from 10AM--9PM--?? This can only be told by Steve in
his own words--Stay tuned--Bless you Steve--I will always owe you!.
