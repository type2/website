Subject: Re: salvage yard poptop hinges

Are most salvage yard unwilling to let go of the hinges without taking the 
whole top?  My top is in great shape and I have yet to find a source for the 
hinges so my search continues.  Surely someone will let go of some hinges 
somewhere.  I'm tired of tying my roof down with rope on windy days.  If 
anyone on the list knows of any sources for poptop hinges for a 70 Westy 
please let me know.


PS: by hinges I mean the levers that the poptop opens on that attach to the 
front roof section and open to a 45ish degree angle (not the latches).  
Anybody parting out a baywindow westy?

Thanks
