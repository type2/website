I was told by a local body guy that most modern paints are not compatible with
lead filler and to either remove it or find primer specifically for lead filler.
THe &quot;shade tree mechanic&quot; on tnn also said this in one episode.  I have also seen
a new filler made up of aluminum but have heard nothing about it, anyone heard
anything about this?

&gt;                        The January issue of Car Collector has a good intro to
&gt; &quot;leading&quot;, for those
