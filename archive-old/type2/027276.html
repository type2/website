&quot;I still have a big oil leak and the engine is pretty
damm hot after a short test run. I remember bending the dipstick sleve
when installing the motor. The leak comes from the area around the
alternater where the rbber bootie thing hooks on and the suspect dipstick.
I t leaks alot whenever the engine is running. Any common leak spots known
of there.

Did you swap the sleeve from an old motor?  Did you transfer/replace the 
little gasket the snugs the sleeve in the block?  I ALMOST did that about a 
week ago.

Hey, is that where the horseshoe-ish shaped (along bottom flange) rubber 
boot goes (at base of filler tube, btwn plastic extendable sleeve &amp; metal?)? 
  Leftovers bother me, but it seemed like it might rub the v-belt (or are 
you talking about the big booty?).

I was leaking out of two (now one) valve covers; is this oil running off 
your heat exchange (don't know know of dis/similarities btwn years yet)?  
I'm thinking my remaining leak is:  gasket (even after hi-temp gasket maker 
btwn gasket &amp; cover) or a &quot;scratch&quot; around the edges on the block, or maybe 
a push rod tube seal.  Could where you found the oil be sprayback from 
something else?

I'm a newbie, so I could (quite) possibly be (tragically?) off...
