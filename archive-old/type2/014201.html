Subject: Re: [T2] whomp whomp...



&gt; Well, I took the bus back to the place where I had the
&gt; tires mounted.  It appeared that the driver's side
&gt; front tire had lost its weight.  Well, they put the
&gt; new weight on the inside of the wheel.  All of the
&gt; others are on the outside.  That seemed a bit odd to
&gt; me.

Weights are placed on both the outside and inside edges of the wheel to achieve balance.  That's how it's done on a dynamic balancer.

&gt; The main reason I took it in, was due to the whomp
&gt; whomp I get under the floor on the driver's side.  I
&gt; assumed it was a tire balance problem.
&gt; 
&gt; So here's the run down: I have new bearings, tie
&gt; rods/ends, draglink, balljoints, sway bar rubber
&gt; mounts, new tires, new shocks and a front end
&gt; alignment.  The sound occurs at 35 mph and &quot;goes away&quot;
&gt; when faster.  The speedometer moves with the sound
&gt; (flickering with the oscilation I guess.)
&gt; 
&gt; What else could it be?

Perhaps you are having a tread separation?  Try putting the spare there and see if the problem goes away.
