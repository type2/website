Subject: Bus mpg FWIW

Last weekend I went to a flea market and found a lady selling car ads from
old magazines.  I bought the only two bus ads she had.  They are from old
Life magazines and measure 10 1/2 x 13.
One ad pictures a Campmobile that looks exactly like my 72 Campmobile.  In
the copy below the picture it says, &quot;averages 23 miles to a gallon of gas&quot;.
The other ad pictures a Splitty and the copy says it has 21 windows, but
form the front view shown I don't see the 21 windows.  Anyway this ad claims
24 mpg.

It occurred to me that VW advertised for a number of years in Life
magazine.  You should be able to find these mags at Antique shops and maybe
second hand stores if you want a cool ad featuring your old bus when it was
brand new.
I'm keeping the Campmobile ad but I'll part with the splitty ad for 3 bucks
if somebody wants it.
