Subject: Re: old tires/firsthand experience

Dear Listers:

Jeff's post could not be more timely or correct!  While I was heading to 
Eastern Washington yesterday (Friday/30th) to attend the Roger Waters 
concert at the Gorge Amphitheater my '76 bus suddenly started to vibrate and 
shudder at about 65 MPH on I-90.  Prior to that time we had been enjoying 
some very happy motoring and were about 100 miles from Seattle, near 
Ellensburg.

We slowed and made our way to the first available exit with the flashers 
going.  Two other concert goers followed us off the freeway and told us that 
the right rear tire was wobbling badly.  Sure enough, the tire was visibly 
warped and out of round.  We checked all the suspension and found no other 
problems.

This is the bus that I acquired this past January and have been detailing 
and driving.  The Goodyear tires were visibly excellent, with only about 10K 
miles on them, and also were about TEN YEARS OLD.  Diagnosis indicated 
sidewall failure which could have ended in a catastrophic blowout.  
Fortunately, the spare tire was good and we were able to continue on, see 
the concert, camp, and return home safely.  Needless to say I'll have to buy 
a new set of tires before any other significant driving is done.  I'm only 
glad the story has a happy ending for my two friends and me.  Thanks goes to 
two strangers who took the time to let us know what they observed on the 
freeway.

Lesson learned.  Make sure the rubber is is good shape.  I spent significant 
time upgrading the brakes to ensure that we could safely stop.  My work 
wouldn't have helped a bit in this case.  I also, like most anyone else, 
checked the inflation and visible condition of the tires.  They LOOKED FINE. 
  A blowout at 65 MPH with a fully loaded VW Bus would not have been a 
pretty sight.

Side note:  For Pink Floyd and Roger Waters fans the concert was most 
excellent.  On cue a 727 or DC9 flew out of the clouds and directly over 
center stage at about 500-1000 feet to start the show.  It was great.  Any 
others out there who saw the show?

Best regards,
Walt Fogle

Some time back there was a post asking about the advisability of running on 
old tires. Tires which are older than 6 years old should only be used in an 
emergency and then with caution.&quot;
