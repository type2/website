Subject: more vendors

Update to post made last week regarding vendors:

MOFOCO: I had ordered a set of KYB shocks, sway bar mounting kit and a tie 
rod. Got some wrong parts, UPS completely bungled the delivery. UPS got in 
contact with MOFOCO, ordered me three new shocks (lost by UPS) which were 
sent promptly at no cost to me. MOFOCO also took back the non-adjustable tie 
rod they had sent me and exchanged it for an adustable one, more expensive 
but they didn't charge me the extra amount. Even though it was my fault for 
not ordering adjustable in the first place. Overall, I'd say they did an 
excellent job putting things right. I would have no qualms about ordering 
from them again.
Bob
