Subject: Hose for external oil cooler - keeps spliting

My 74 1800 CC bus has an external oil cooler on it from the PO.  I
have had the bus for about a year.  It has two hoses to it.  It seems
like I only get acouple of months use out of it before the one hose
splits and oil comes streaming out of it.  The split is always close
to the external oil cooler and I believe it is always the same hose.  
This has become a royal pain.  Any suggestions on what type of hose I
should ask for or where I should get it?  I have always asked for high
temp hose but it's not lasting.  I've gotten it from Advanced Auto and
Auto Zone?  Would NAPA carry better hose?  Should I go to a
hydraulic's company specializing in hose?  I'd remove the external oil
cooler if I could do it without taking the engine out but I don't
think I can remove the oil filter adapter from just underneath.  It
still has the standard oil cooler (is that still working along with
the external oil cooler?) but the oil filter adapter (for the lack of
a better word) has been replaced with one that the hoses can connect
to run to the external oil cooler.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated because I'm tired of breaking down out on the road.

Kevin
