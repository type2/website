Subject: Revell of Germany, VW Bus Models???

Hi All,

This is off-topic from the 1:1 scale buses, but I'll go ahead and ask it
as the model newsgroup group hasn't responded:

I noticed in an ad in Scale Auto that Revell of Germany now makes 2 1/24th
scale VW Buses.  Could someone fill me in on this?  What Years?  What
features?  Detail? etc.  One is designated UN.  Thanks in advance,
