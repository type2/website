&gt; Howdy,
&gt; I was just wondering...is it possible to convert a regular bus into
&gt; a westy. I know its a dumb question (stop laughing),  but I'm new. 
&gt; If it is how much does it cost (aproximate).  Can you actually buy
&gt; all of the stuff for a westy (cabinets windows, pop top, range,
&gt; etc.) Just a thought THanx hunter

Hunter, a lot depends on what year bus and whether you mean convert 
to a true Westfalia design or some other, even homebuilt, 
alternative.  68-73 Westies are based on sunroof busses, with extra 
frame stiffening down below.  Later ones (that I know of) have an 
even more highly modified roof.  Can't say for sure about 64-67 
bodies.

If you don't care about having a poptop, it's even easier to go 
&quot;legit&quot; since nearly all the interior stuff was easy to remove.  So 
easy that it's hard to find the earlier stuff.  But in the 68-73 
westies, for example, the rear side cabinet, rear seat/bed, and 
jumpseat are bolt/screw on.  Others require more work.  I have an 
official VW parts manual for the 68-72 westy models and you'd be 
surprised at how much there is to make it a complete westy.

I'd advise finding a real westy if you want the whole experience, but 
if you're just interested in some cabinets and a bed in back you can 
make a pretty reasonable facsimile on your own with minor woodworking 
skills, and you don't have to wreck the interior in the process.  
About twenty years ago I built a westy-inspired interior in Maj. 
Hangover, my '62 bus, that included a foldout bed and removable 
table, etc.  (see car #4 at 
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/restore.html).  I still have the 
plan sketches if anyone is interested.

YMMV,
Joe
