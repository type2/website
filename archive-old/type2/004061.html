Hi,

If you're located in California- near the Central Coast (San Luis Obispo) or
are willing to drive a bit:

I have an '82 Westfalia (brown/white top) in great mechanical condition
(doesn't need any
mechanical repairs)..

- California registered/smogged 'til 11.2000/11.2001, respectively (both
done 10.12.99)..

- Federal (non-California vehicle.. Originally from Oregon)

- overall good body and interior (everything works/is complete) no rust..
Interior is very nice, seats un-ripped, wallpaper is peeling/partially
missing on inside of sliding door and inside of rear hatchback, otherwise
complete and nice- nothing really noticeable.. Cabinets are clean and in
very good shape- as well as stove, sink and refrigerator.. Outside
receptacles are all in working order.. Poptop is in great condition, no rips
or tears- all zippers work..

- some damage to the driver's door (by previous owner, swiped something)
which is pushed in, but opens/closes fine (window is hard to roll-down more
than 1/2-way) and a dinged up rear bumper (both ends are &quot;pinched&quot;)..
Windshield has chips- all other glass in good condition.. Rubber seal around
poptop is separating from fiberglass on driver's side in places.. Brown
paint has &quot;mellowed&quot; with age, but still shines with a good wash and wax..

- 50K on rebuilt engine and transmission (no original receipts, but, a
signed statement from the original owner attesting to this) I have seen the
original receipt for the tranny (shown to me by mechanic who did job) Same
mechanic did work on VW (VW Certified) from 1982 - 1997..

- everything else (mechanically) has been rebuilt over the past 20K, ie.
brakes (rotors, drums, pads and shoes- just had checked, was told they are
still like &quot;new&quot;..), exhaust system (crossover pipe, muffler, gaskets, etc),
emissions equipment (egr valve, egr filter, catalytic converter), new clutch
(complete, including mainshaft and pilot-bearing, 1K ago), motor mounts (200
miles ago, along with some other repairs/welding to re-inforce the mount
brackets).. Recent tune-up (3 - 4K ago), with new filters all around,
Pertronix &quot;point-eliminator&quot; was installed at that time..

- cv boots/joints are in good condition (no cracks in boots)

- drives straight, no &quot;drifting&quot;/&quot;shimmy&quot;, etc..

- No &quot;quirks&quot;- other than on cold days the speedometer needle sometimes
sticks (easily freed with a tap) and the heater slider-controls are tough to
move..

- always driven carefully, oil changed religiously (Castrol &quot;Syntec&quot; 5W/50)
and full-synthetic &quot;Redline&quot; in the transmission (just replaced 1K ago)..
Regular maintenance always performed (since new) nothing has ever gone to
&quot;pot&quot;- things always fixed as happened..

- Complete with all curtains, original jack, manuals (for Vanagon,
Westfalia, refrigerator/stove/sink unit and Chilton's), etc.. 2 studded snow
tires.. AM/FM cassette.. Also has a &quot;CB&quot; unit- needs antenna..

- Have owned for 2.5 years and I'm selling in order to buy a new car/don't
go camping often enough to warrant having this vehicle- not a lemon, great
running vehicle, never had any problems with it.. Ready for daily driving
and camping.. Just needs some minimal bodywork (door) and either the rear
bumper hammered out, or replaced..

- if you'd like to take a gander at 'er, please arrange with me for an
appointment, also, if you have a certified mechanic you'd like to bring
along or would like to bring this VW into a shop to have it looked over, I'm
more than willing to do this with pre-arrangement..

** $4500.00 **
