&gt; CO is burned fuel. You are NOT too lean, you are TOO rich. You need to lean
&gt; it down or lower your fuel pressure or replace your wornout injectors.... As
&gt; injectors wear, the pintles pound into the seat, making the point taper
&gt; grooved. Like a carb idle screw if you tighten it too tight. The ECU tells
&gt; the injector how long to stay open but it can't tell it how much to inject.
&gt; New it injects X amount of fuel per millisecond, worn it will inject maybe
&gt; twice as much for the same millisecond duration.
&gt; 
&gt; What is your compression?

130-130-120-120  There are &lt;2K miles on this rebuild, it's pretty fresh.

&gt; What is your fuel pressure at idle?

Will check in the AM and report.  I have a spare pressure regulator if
that's the problem.

&gt; What is your timing at idle?

7.5 BTDC with the stock '78 dist.  Smack on.  Dwell is also at 49

&gt; Will Virginia allow you to add a catalytic converter??

Karl, I am considering this strongly.  I have (not installed) a complete
'78 exhaust system with the cat replacement pipe, but I could order a cat
and stick it in w/o any heartburn.  I'd rather get the vac leaks fixed and
make sure it is not mis-firing.  I do detect slight irregularities at idle
and am replacing the plugs and wires. 

Thanks, Karl!
