Subject: Heater

Hi again,
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to shut the heaters off tightly? After
spending much time getting my heating system working properly for winter, now
we are in summer here in Australia, they don't shut off tightly. I have made
sure the cables work freely, and that the flaps on the engine work correctly
(spring closes them), I've even tried disconnecting the cables all together. I
have removed the flaps to have a closer look and all appears OK. Did these
always allow a little hot air past when closed? There is enough 'blow by' that
I can just feel heat on my feet (shoes off) at highway speeds.
