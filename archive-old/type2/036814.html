Subject: jalousie window rubbers

Hi,
My 70 Westy never had these rubber jalousie window rubbers either.  I had 
seen them on other campers, and was jealous.  I finally found 2 in a junked 
bus this past weekend and got them for a couple of bucks.  Sure looks nice 
and covers the mounting screws that were exposed.
