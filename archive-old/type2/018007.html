&gt; for months and even keeps a piece which has rusted in half together.  Also
&gt; gives the urban motorcycle that 'rat bike' look which is an effective
&gt; theft deturant.  On the crossover pipe it would not be visable.  BONUS!
&gt; you can do the job in situ!  Not the right way, but its about an 85%
&gt; solution and cheap and quick and you can find more cans and hose clamps
&gt; anywhere there are roads.

For a few dollars more, many welding shops (look for one with a lift)
will weld up the exhaust pipe, also sometimes in situ. Several times a
$25 to $30 visit has extended the life of one on these dreadful
waterboxers that I own.
