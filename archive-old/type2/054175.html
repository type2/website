Subject: Gas filler leak

I would have sworn that I just read something about
this in a recent post, but I can't find it (maybe it
is &quot;old-timers&quot; disease that my son says that I have).

My problem is that I get some seepage of gasoline from
the filler neck of the gas tank when the gas tank is
full.  It seems to seep out where the flexible rubber
hose from the filler on the side of the bus meets the
metal neck on the tank.  Should this have a clamp on
it, be sealed with gasket sealer or other sealer, or
what is the best thing to do?  It looks like a real
bear to try to replace the rubber tube part.
Even when the tank is half full, we still get
occassional whifs of gas smell in the back seat, and
I'm not sure if this is all part of the same problem.
I did search the archives about this, and got some
info, but wonder if anyone has any recent experiences
with the seepage problem.
Thanks, and have a good holiday weekend (those of you
in the United States, at least).
