Subject: re upholstering seats

Great winter project going here, aside from my chirping/squeaking coming  
from the right side of the engine, I am going to redo the seats, the springs are  
making it uncomfortable.
 
Ratwell, your site is great, so much information it is amazing, thank  you!  
I looked at your description of doing your seats, and my only  question is how 
did you wash the fabric?  It looked so faded in the  beginning and the end 
pictures look great.
 
What's your secret?
 
Also, where did you order your upholstery from?
 
Thank you!
 
~Jeremy
