Find someone that sells or can order Sta-Lube products. A gallon of GL 4 is
part # SL24239

From: &quot;Isaiah&quot; &lt;punkerbat_at_vbe_dot_com&gt;

&gt; I've been to every auto parts store and any wholesaler I can find around
here
&gt; and nobody has it nor can they order it.  I took a night specifically for
the
&gt; search of it...and that night was wasted as nobody has the stuff.
&gt; I found Hypoid 90 gear oil in little bottles that are used for marine
purposes
&gt; though... whats this stuff?
