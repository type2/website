You can get that spring from Ken at The Bus Co.   www.thebusco_dot_com  Great
place to get stuff from.  (I don't know him personally, just done business
before &amp; have been very happy) I changed this last summer.  Quite a bugger
to do, but now my lock works better.  I still have problems now &amp; then.  I
might have done something wrong.

good luck,

&gt; Yes, you have a spring missing (they break).  The complete procedure on
&gt; how to fix this is contained in:

&gt;
&gt; Do this now!  Continued operation without the spring can damage your lock
&gt; cylinder!
