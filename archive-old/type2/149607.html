Subject: Thanks, you may have saved my life

Spent the weekend replacing front wheel bearings and brake hoses on my 75.
Everything went well and I am quite happy I followed the advice of many list
members to replace my brake hoses. Right before I ordered the parts to do the
wheel bearings I noticed that the brakes would stick on the passenger side if
I applied the E-brake with my foot on the pedal while parked in my inclined
driveway. I have read on the list time and again on the list that sticking
brakes can be caused by bad brake hoses, so I ordered a set for all wheels.
After replacing the hoses, flushing the fluid, and bleeding the system with a
vacuum pump (works great) I got around to looking at the old hoses. At first
glance they were all in ok shape, but closer inspection revealed a 4&quot; crack
running the length of the rear passenger side hose. This hose wasn't leaking
but probably accounts for the mushy feel of the pedal before the repair. The
other hoses had no external damage but were so stiff that when I tried to
straighten one of the hoses from the front axle, IT BROKE IN TWO! Am I
relieved that I found out about the condition of these hoses after they were
replaced rather than after an accident.

Many thanks to all of you who profess that we should replace brake hoses on
any newly purchased bus. Great advice, I am convinced! You may have saved my
life!

Tip of the day, freeze your new bearing races before driving or pressing them
into your hubs. They go in so much easier!
