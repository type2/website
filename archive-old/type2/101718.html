Subject: Re: [T2] Accelarator pump tube??? (to be or not to be!)

Hello Ben and list   This missing tube is one of the problems that the dual 
solexs had. I  think that it is NLA . I had one drop into a motor and pinched 
the piston ring, had to tear the motor down and replace the piston. Also have 
had the flapper on a Air flow meter on a FI bus do the same thing!  If it 
isn't one thing it's another. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
