Subject: front window crank r&amp;r

driving home from &quot;work&quot; last Friday found me unable
to raise or lower my driver's side window. The gearbox
in the cranker thinger has gone kaput.
 
How do I remove this thing? I have a lot of it
apart, but it's non-obvious.
 
Within the last 2 weeks, my shift coupler sheared, the pin
holding the clutch cable to the pedal sheared, my window stopped
working (bad in the monsoon season) and my engine has started shutting
down while I'm tooling down the Interstate. I'm thinking it's more crud
in my fuel tank coming home to roost.

At 152,000 miles, I'm starting to wonder if the Bus isn't starting to
tell 
me it wants to rest &lt;grin&gt;
 
What is the correct vehicle to transition to after owning a VW Bus for 7
years?
Another bus? :)


take care all
matt
