&gt; Bob Hoover should be able to comment on this.  Twin engine planes with
&gt; contra-rotating props produce no &quot;left turning tendency&quot;,when you lift the
&gt; nose, the way a single does.  The props are like big gyros and the have the
&gt; gyroscopic effects that we are discussing.
 
&gt; Am I right about the self cancelling pairs (or trios or whatever)??
&gt; 
I believe this is largely correct, course stability courses are a
way back.
