Subject:  locking engine hatch (potentially bad idea)

Everybody just remember.  If you have an engine fire you will want to be able
to use your fire extinguisher (you do carry one right) quickly.  If you make
it so you have to reach in from the over the engine hatch your bus will burn
no doubt about it.  Cables may burn or melt and then again your bus is toast.
If you are truly paranoid.  Make sure the engine lid is only locked when you
are parked and not driving.  I for one would never drive with my engine lid
locked as every second counts in a fire and I do not want to be fumbling with
keys , weird cable or slide bolt locks as my baby is burning.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
