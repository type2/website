&gt;    Yeah, mine does that too -- but it seems like it's anything much over
&gt; 50. I don't have the seal on either part of the top yet, so I don't know
&gt; if that makes a difference or not. Mine's a lot better when I have my
&gt; Yakima top carriers on and a sailboard clamped to the racks.

Mine does this as well.  It only started when I put on a new seal.  
The new seal is doesn't really seal, grrr...  I'll have to find
a decent seal replacement someday.  I don't recall who I bought
it from, but I'm not happy with it.  The rear seal is fine though.
