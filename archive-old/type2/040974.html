Subject: Re: Engine Dolly - what CAD package do I use

Several have asked, so here goes:  I normally use MicroStation, and that's
what I used for this plan.  But the cad file per se is not available, as I
don't want it floating around without the disclaimer on it.

If the helpful guy who wrote that disclaimer for me wants to comment, I'm
open to sending it out into the world.  Your name is up in the file from the
first mailing, but everyone's asleep.  What do you think, Perry Mason?

&gt;Hi John
&gt;
&gt;Second only getting Ms Parton to help with engine r+r,  your idea of a
&gt;purpose-built tool sounds like the best way to go.  I would like a
&gt;copy of your plan by snailmail.  Also if you could pencil it in on the
&gt;border...... Which CAD package do you use?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
