Subject: Replacement for egr bolt blue out

High folks. 

    I have a un-usual problem The egr system was removed from my bus and the 
bolt hole in the exhaust chamber of the heads plugged with standard bolts. 
One of then blew out yesterday at freeway speeds. Now I sound like a 
motorcycle and the screw does not screw in. It seems the threads are gone. 
Because the bolt head also covers tinwork (don't think it is necessary to 
hold the tin on) I am concerned about using - say JB weld and not being able 
to get the bolt out if the tin work needs removal in the future. Also, I sure 
would like to avoid engine removal to fix the problem if at all possible.
