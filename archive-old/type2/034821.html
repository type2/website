&gt; 
&gt; It is time that I buy a new CB antenna anyway, I don't think that my
&gt; very old loaded-coil Antenna Specialists antenna is doing its thing
&gt; as
&gt; well as it should. Since CB radios are considered de classe, I am
&gt; embarrassed to ask you guys, but what is the current hot brand? (Over
&gt; 20
&gt; years ago, a Ham told me to buy an Antenna Specialists antenna).
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have room for the six-foot Firestick. Is there anything else
&gt; a
&gt; bit shorter? And please point me to a URL where I can buy the durn
&gt; thing
&gt; on the Web. We don't have any decent CB shops in the San Francisco
&gt; Bay
&gt; Area, and I am not going to ask at HRO.

Firestiks are made in shorter lengths as well.  They can be easily
found at stores that sell (big) truck accessories.  The price is right,
too.
