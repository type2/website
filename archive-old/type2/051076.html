Subject: [T2] knob?

I have this question that has been bugging me for a long time.  I have a
1972 bus and as I'm sitting in the driver seat, I reach down behind my right
calf and there is this knob that goes in and out.  I can't figure out for
the life of me what that is for.  I see no changes whatsoever and haven't
found info on it in any of my manuals.  Any ideas??

Also, the PO was a wanna be McGyver with the electrical system.  Often,
especially after running for a couple hours, when I try to start my bus,
nothing happens.  I found the trick is to reach under my dash, wiggle all
the wires and try again.  Most of the time that does that trick.  In fact,
it seems the problem wire is a yellow one that is joined with a male/female
electrical connector combination that is encased in the original VW plastic.
I haven't taken the time to find out where it goes and comes from, but that
may not even be the problem.  Any ideas as to what I should do here??

Michael
