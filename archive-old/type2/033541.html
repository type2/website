I think you're right for carbs Steve, the difference is the original
statement was for fuel injection which measures a volume of air and injects
an appropriate amount of fuel.  In this case it would mean less oxygen in
the air measured = runs lean.  The computer doesn't know how much oxygen is
in the air, just the amount of air.  I'm surprised there isn't some altitude
compensation built into our fuel injection... like how bad will it effect it
as I'm climbing to the pass?

&gt; &gt; The advantage to all of this, of course, is when you're driving up that
&gt; &gt; mountain pass with your fully-loaded westy in the nice thin air
(remember,
&gt; &gt; there's no altitude compensator on the average FI bus), and the heads
start
&gt; &gt; to bake, you could flip the switch on the dash and enrichen the fuel
&gt; &gt; mixture, at once cooling the heads and slightly increasing the available
HP.
&gt; &gt; Kinda like a little do-it-yourself engine management.
&gt;
&gt; okay, myabe i have misunderstood something here....
&gt;
&gt; higher altitude=less oxygen per liter of air.  So i thought, when one goes
&gt; to high altitude you need to _lean_ out the mixture as the higher you go
&gt; the ammount of fuel metered stays constant, but the oxygen content
&gt; decreases as you ascend.  then, logically, one would need to lean out the
&gt; carb to match the changed oxygen content of the air.
&gt;
&gt; less air+same ammount of gas=too rich???
&gt;
&gt; let me know if i am wrong because i have advised a friend to lean out his
&gt; carb if he runs bad at high altitude and i want to give him the straight
&gt; scoop if i goofed.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Steve
