&gt; I just got done replacing the rear (square cage) bushing for my 78 westy.  What a pain in the ass that was.
&gt; I put the new bushing on the front last week, and still couldn't get into 4th.
&gt; doin 50 on the highway in 3rd is no fun.
&gt; so I decide to replace the other one in back.


I suggest you weld the cage ... If you put in a new , thinner , cheaper shifter
coupler,, the centers tend to slip and rotate, making it hard to find the
gears,, as they are just pressed in,, so a small weld will stop this from
happening.
