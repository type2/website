Subject: Re: [T2] Replacement sliding door track
Message-ID: &lt;bdb.1b979c4d.341d1a23_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

My welder an' I are planning out the sliding door track replacement
(the complete three piece unit from Bus Depot).
All tips/websites/etc related to this are welcome...

I did the one on my '77?six-eight months ago.? I replaced the inner and outer rockers and the slider track.?(and the outriggers, and jack points, and rear corner, and battery tray, and front fender, and part of the rear wheel opening...)
VERY IMPORTANT!!? 
The (Klokkerholm--from Bus Depot) slider track that?I got was not welded together right.??At the front of the?track the slot for the vertical roller tapered so that it was too narrow at the front (as installed on?the bus)? to allow the door to close.? I had to drill the spot welds out about a foot or so back and use my lower door bracket and rollers to adjust the space correctly.? If you weld the track in without checking this, you won't be able to correct it with the track piece welded in.
I don't know if this is a common problem with the replacement tracks, but I would check it before I installed.? Have lots of Vise Grips and check: check: check the fit before you weld anything.? I had the door on and off at least a half a dozen times trimming and adjusting everything.? Lots of spot welds to drill, so have a few sharp drill bits.? Have some POR15 or Rust Bullet or whatever flavor you like handy to coat the inner panels (I sandblasted everything first) 'cause you don't want to?do this job again!??
I'm working on the passenger side now.? It doesn't have a 3 piece rocker assembly.? Sandblasting everything tomorrow.
Love that road salt!
