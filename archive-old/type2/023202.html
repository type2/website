Subject: Re: [VB] Brake diagnosis experts!

Hmm, repeats only after a long rest? Sounds like a flexible brake hose 
anurism to me.

&gt;OK, here's the situation:
&gt;
&gt;All drum brake system, no booster.
&gt;All shoes adjusted to barely touching the drums.
&gt;Parking brake is adjusted a bit loose
&gt;No leaks from master or wheel cylinders.  No apparent fluid usage.
&gt;
&gt;On the first brake application of the day, pedal goes halfway to floor 
&gt;before brakes engage.  After a couple of applications, play reduces to
&gt;  normal.  If you let the car sit for several hours, the symptom repeats, 
&gt; but if it only sits for a few minutes it does not.
&gt;
&gt;I adjusted the shoes after the car sat overnight, so it probably isn't a 
&gt;sticking wheel cylinder.
&gt;
&gt;It doesn't seem to make any difference whether the parking brake is set or 
&gt;not.
&gt;
&gt;I have a couple of ideas, but I won't contaminate you with them.  I'd like 
&gt;to know your thoughts before I start poking about with a sharp
&gt;stick.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, George
