Subject: Re: [T2] Westy need seatbelts in NJ?

I don't know what the law is up there but it still hurts in a crash.... 

As a former Navy MP, I went to a few fatal crash scenes. Went to 2 where seatbelts for the back seat rider would have made the difference. The front seat folks were okay, the backseat passenger flew all over the place and in 1 case flew out the borken rear window, the other smashed all the windows with her head. 

But it's your life. 

The fed law states you have to have front and rear belt in any car after 1966. Don't know if that is the same for trucks or vans. 

I've often wondered what happens in a BIG RV during a crash - how much of all that cabinetry comes lose and fly around. We looked inside a $250K camper bus at the local Airstream dealer. NICE!!! Even had a staircase (oak!) that went to a hatch in the roof where you could sit on a patio with fold up railings... Oh and real ceramic tile floors downstairs. A different world...
