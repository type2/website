I screwed up on the Jalousie Kit. My intention was to offer 
the &quot;Kit&quot; for $90 or the items seperatley for:
$60 Windows
$40 Frame
Sorry for not proofreading
Thanks,
Chris

---- HERE IS THE CORRECTED TEXT ----

Jalousie widow kit for b80 to b85 Vanagon Side Windows. 
Includes Jalousie Windows from a Bay and separate aluminum 
frames cut to fit Vanagon side window openings $90- US plus 
shipping. Would work for a bay without without the seperate 
frames. Will sell windows seperately for $60 US and frame for 
$40 US.
