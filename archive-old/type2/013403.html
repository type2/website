&gt;Why are you putting type 3 tin on a type 1 engine?  Does it cool better?  

Type 3 cool tins are a replacement for the small original pieces that fit under and between the cylinders, and were called air deflectors.  VW designed these for the later type 3 motors and they apparently work much better.  These pieces are marketed as &quot;Cool Tins&quot; by many of the mail-order places that advertise in the VW magazines.  People that have switched to these pieces highly recommend them.
