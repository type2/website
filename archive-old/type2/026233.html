Last year, a few weeks after I first got my '70 on the road, I was unable to
turn it over one day after work.  I initially thought the starter was the
problem but a new starter didn't help.  Like you, I noted that the lights
worked and the battery was fully charged.  The problem, after much
frustration, turned out to be a bad ground on the tranny.

If you aren't getting gas, I would suspect that you have the lines hooked up
to the pump backwards, or the pump is defective, or you have a pump rod from
an alternator style pump (the base of the pump is shorter so the rod has to
be shorter).

As for the tranny being stuck in gear, are you the one who talked about
leaving the shift lever in gear when attaching the linkage?  If so, I
remember thinking at the time, that you should hook it up while everything
is in neutral.  I'm thinking that your tranny is on one side of the H
pattern and your shift lever is on the other and there isn't enough free
play to allow it to get into neutral.  Other possibilities are that maybe
your clutch cable isn't adjusted right or you have the wrong throwout
bearing for the style of clutch plate you are using.

I'm just trying to think of all the stupid things I've done over the years
and maybe I can help you get one step closer to getting it on the road.

&gt; 
&gt; the vehicle won't start. there is new gas in it, and i had to toke on it
&gt; to
&gt; get fuel into the pump. however, gas isn't making it to the carb. and the
&gt; tranny is still stuck in some gear - not neutral, which makes
&gt; hand-cranking
&gt; the engine difficult. so everytime i try to start it i have to use clutch.
&gt; wondering what is related, if whether it is the regulator, igition switch,
&gt; both, neither. - steve
