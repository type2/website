&gt; When I went to get tires on my bus, they wouldn't let my pull the bus
&gt; in the bay (normal for shops). The kid that got the job of pulling it
&gt; in fired it up, and started driving. He didn't kick down the fast idle
&gt; or wait a moment to let the engine get even a little warm or anything.
&gt;
&gt; So he's pulling in with the idle at 2200rpm, and it's blamming away
&gt; making all kinds of racket (exhaust leak) in the echoing cavernous
&gt; service bay. I was laughing my arse off.
&gt;
&gt; The kid came into the waiting room all embarassed, and asked me what
&gt; driving that antique is like.

one major advantage of having the van equipped with Hand controls, no one
will take the responsibility for driving it.......

&gt; My reply?

I like your reply better
