X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Indeed it does.

This is a classic &quot;litmus test&quot; for any person claiming to be in business as
a &quot;VW specialist/expert/whatever&quot;.  If they aim that jack anywhere near the
underside of the engine [to lift the vehicle], get your bus out of there
ASAP.  Do not hesitate, do not pass &quot;GO&quot;, just scram.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Then NEVER jack the bus up by the motor!  It tears them [the motor
mounts] every time.  &lt;&lt;
