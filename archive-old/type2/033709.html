&gt; The &quot;sling&quot; is mearly a 2&quot; square piece of tubing about 20&quot; long with a
&gt; short piece of chain welded to the center that we hook our chain hoist to.
&gt; Welded to each end of the square tubing is another length of chain about
&gt; 16&quot; long, then a short piece of flat steel welded to the chain with a hole
&gt; drilled in it.
***
would a couple of bike tire tubes and a hefty screw locking link attached
to a chain work? or are you talking about some kind of other tubing?
