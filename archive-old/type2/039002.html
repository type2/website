Subject: OT: airbag warning

While not an issue for our vehicles, it says here

  Science News, 15 April 2000, p.251
  http://www.sciencenews_dot_org/20000415/toc.asp

that wetting the powder inside an undetonated airbag is
a Very Bad Thing in that it produces &quot;hightly volatile
hydrazoic acid.&quot;  Quoting further,

  Sodium azide is an explosive, broad-spectrum biocide
  with toxicity comparable to sodium cyanide's. &quot;Lethal
  to practically all forms of life.&quot;
  ...
  U.S. vehicles are a reservoir for some 5 million Kg
  of sodium azide, with lots more due to hit the streets
  as the latest-model cars increasiniong include passenger
  side airbags, side-impact bags, and ceiling bags.
  ...
  Auto recyclers who might shred or smash conaisters of
  sodium azide face the biggest safety threat.

So, if your hobby is a bit more catholic than just
the type 2 VW, watch out.
