Subject: Seatbelt Mounting

I saw a post to the list about a month ago that where someone
indicated they had mounted the seatbelt spool on the metal wall
behind the passenger and driver's seats.  Can anyone tell me how
to contact the person that sent that post to the list?  I would like
to ask him/her some questions.  Thanks.
