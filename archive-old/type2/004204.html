The most important thing to remember is lots of warm clothes &amp; drinks. You
might want to take a can of &quot;easy start&quot; an ether(?) based spray, that you
spray into the carb mouth if you can't start on a damp morning. It will
ignite by compression like a diesel, then the ignition should catch. However
do NOT use this too much as you bus might get addicted (I kid you not!).

In addition I highly recommend you avoid eating any yellow snow!
