Subject: 1968-1971 Gas gauge sender - tech info

This is basically a &quot;memo to the archives&quot; on the tubular gas gauge sender.
Mine, like most, does not work so I went over to a nearby VW junk store
(Buggy Man) and asked if they had any.  Not surprisingly, John had a box
with some labeled &quot;bad&quot; and one not labeled (but tested bad).  I bought one
bad one and the unlabeled on, got home, and took them apart to see if there
was any hope of repair and found that the unlabeled one had a stuck float
but good wire and  was repairable!  So I have a good sender to install when
next the engine comes out (probably today or tomorrow).

If you have never opened one of these things up, the way to do it is to
flatten the flaps on the washer on the bottom of the tube and remove  the
7/32&quot; nut (*not*  a  5mm or 6mm, but bloody 7/32!)  Pull the aluminum tube
and you are faced with a center post and float that is supposed to slide
freely on the post.  As it slides, it wipes a .003 diameter resistance wire
that is soldered to the top of the sender drops down to a T-bar and comes
back up to be soldered to the contact.  If the wire is present, DON'T MUCK
WITH IT!  It is hair fine and delicate.  Check the float to be sure it
slides freely.  If it does not, check the post for accumulated mung and
remove with your fingernail or some very fine sandpaper.  After that, check
for resistance between the push-on terminal and the base.  On my sender it
varied from ~50 ohms and 110 ohms.

I have never tried to replace the wire but I will be shopping this week and
will report success or failure.  If I do find it, I am thinking it will be a
VERY delicate operation to replace both because of the fragility of the wire
and because resistance wire usually requires silver solder.  We shall see.
