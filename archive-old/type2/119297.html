Subject: Re: [T2] cut off hose

Hi Christopher,

Question: Is the brake pedal REALLY hard to press?

I would suggest you follow that hose to its source; my guess would be 
that it ends at the brake booster attached to the front of your master 
cylinder, just behind the front axle beam. Whoever installed the weber 
carb didn't know what to hook that hose up to, so they inadvertently 
disabled your power brakes. Hook that hose up to a suitable vacuum port 
and you'll be amazed at how much better your brakes work.

OTOH, since the 1973 auto tranny also needs vacuum, you might have a 
problem running power brakes and the auto tranny from a single carb. I 
know diddly about single carbs, so I'll shut up now and let someone 
with more experience put their $.02 in now.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; I just noticed this...
&gt; On the driver side, there is a hose coming out the top of the tin 
&gt; behind the intake runner (in front of firewall).  It has been cut off 
&gt; and just sticking out/up.
&gt; Any ideas on what this is/was?
&gt; If it helps any, the pass. side head has the two threaded metal tubes 
&gt; sticking out next to the intake runners..was for smog pump I guess.
