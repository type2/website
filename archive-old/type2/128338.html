Subject: Re: [T2] Dash Lights

&gt; Last night for the first time since I bought my bus last spring, I had
&gt; occasion to use the high-beams. Lo and behold, my dash lights all came
&gt; on when the high-beams were on. Since buying the van, I assumed that the
&gt; bulbs were shot and hand not been replaced. Now I know that to not be
&gt; the case, but I am trying to figure out what's up. Has anyone else
&gt; encountered this, or have any ideas on how to fix it?

if i were to guess i would say that the variable resistive part of the
headlight switch went bad (pretty common) and the po moved the dash light
wire to one of the hi beam feeds, maybe at the fuse block.

a little tracing should clear it up. see thoms color wiring diagram
