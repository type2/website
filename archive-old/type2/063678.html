&gt;How about adjusting/replacing the steering box?  I  have these parts
&gt;and thought I'd at least replace the pivot pin and bushing tommorrow
&gt;(Saturday).
I know Muir has a detailed section on this in his book &quot;How To Keep Your
Volkswagen Alive&quot;.  I think Bob disagreed a bit on a one or two of Muir
suggestions, but I think the basic procedure is okay.  As for the steering
box, removing the drop lever from the splined steering shaft is the only
hard part.  You need to go to a tool rental place and get a two-jawed
puller for tie rod ends.  The right tool will be very beefy looking,
basically a big chuck of steel with a bolt through the middle.  Anything
else (heat, liquid wrench, normal three-jawed pullers, hitting it with a
hammer, prying, etc.) will be pretty much a complete waste of time.  (Been
there, done that.)  With the right puller, it's pretty easy.  When
installing the new box, align the mark on the center of the steering box
shaft with the mark on the drop arm.  Depending on the year of your drop
arm, it may have two marks, LH and RH for left hand or right hand drive
busses, so choose the appropriate one.
