Subject: to all the stereophiles out there.. Alpine question...

Hey all...

Just a quick question regarding the quality of Alpine stereos.  I just
purchased a TDA-7564 cassette deck for $320.

After talking to my wife (I know, I know), I'm wondering if I've spent too
much money on too much stereo. 

I'm sure a lot of people have brands that they will particularly buy, but
has anyone had good/bad experiences with Alpine stereo equipment?

Or can anyone recommend a cassette player in the $200-$300 range?

Thanks.
