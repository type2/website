Subject: Tail lens housing

I'm having some simple electrical problems where the taillight goes out,
then I twiddle it and the backup light goes out.  I cleaned the contacts but
the housing is so brittle that the metal tabs are moving and everytime I
touch the gray plastic housing it disintegrates.

I've been pretty disappointed with the fit and finish of Mexican made items.
I was going to wait until I got the bus painted but it seems I have to
replace these (211 945 231) now.

Is this disintegration common?

Where can I find a quality housing without the lenses?  One original is made
by SWF and the other made by Hella.
