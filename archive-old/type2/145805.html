Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch Release Bearing Failure

In a message dated 9/23/05 5:01:23 PM, ratwell_at_mac_dot_com writes:


&gt; This has been my experience also. Somewhat disappointing after trying to 
&gt; source THE most German clutch kit parts I could lay my hands on. I'm more 
&gt; inclined to suspect the bearing and not the way the clutch cable was adjusted...
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen Clutch discs stamped Germany on the metal but with a Mexico label 
&gt; in the box to indicate where it really came from.
&gt; 
   Sure that's a &quot;new&quot; clutch kit and not German parts &quot;remanufactured&quot;
in Mexico.. ?-(
