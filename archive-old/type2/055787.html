Subject: Re: Octane -- vs. RON

&gt; 
&gt; 	
&gt; Jim,
&gt;    Do you have any idea how RON measures up to Octane. On the inside of the
&gt; fuel door it says to use a minimum of 91 RON. I may not have spelled that
&gt; correctly, but it for sure doesn't say octane. If RON is metric what is the
&gt; standard equivalent. This is a 65 Bus by the way. I generally use premium
&gt; unleaded fuel which around here is 91 or 92 octane depending where you get
&gt; it. Some stations have 93, but I haven't found too many of those.
&gt; 
Has anybody been reading my postings on this subject???

RON is a measure of octane.  It is not the measure of octane used in teh
US.  VW says 91 RON = 87 US CLC pump octane.

You are throwing away money if you are in the US and are using anything
over 87 octane on a stock engine.  You don't need it and VW didn't say
you need it.
