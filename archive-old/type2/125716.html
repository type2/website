Subject: Re: [T2] VW vs Porsche Backyard Mechanic?

Hello Phil    Being an owner of both I can tell you a lot.  I have on the 
road right now , 1964  356C euro coupe, 1966 912(VW motor 2110cc dual 45 dells, 
1973  914S dual 40 dells.  The 356C is my favorite and is a joy to drive , not 
overly fast but fast enough. parts are expensive and some hard to find, There 
is a good network and some places just sell 356 parts Zims, doc&amp;cly ,  there 
is also the Regestisty which is for 356 and 912s.   The 912 is a nice car  I'm 
building the correct motor for it now but my wife drives it and loves the VW 
with the stinger even thu it is loud.   The 914 are great cars if you can find 
one that isnt rusted . Has the same basic motor as the later bays, the FI 
system leaves a lot to be desired, could be changed over without too much trouble 
but I perfer the dual dells. If you can find a 914/6 then you have the real 
deal . very fast and handles like a dream.  You might also think about a built 
bug which can be done without too much expense   later and have fun  Mark
