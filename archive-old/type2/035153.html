Subject: Westy Jumpseat needed

As I was preparing to go to the Pomona Swap meet this weekend to continue my 
quest for a Westy Jumpseat that goes between the sink and rear facing seat he 
informed me that I am forced to work.  To help me feel better with this, I 
thought I might see if any fellow list members might have one lying around?  
It is the last item I need before my Complete factory resto '71 Westy hits 
the streets of So. Cal..
