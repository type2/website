I didn't think that I was the only one. My dad bought our bus when I was 2 
upon returning to the states and I have been riding or driving it every 
since. I know every millimeter of that bus. I know you feel the same way.

Tractors and busses are good matches. Either one can pull the other out of 
a ditch.

&gt;My parents bought this bus in 1981, when I was four.  Before that we had a

&gt;'89 I think and my older sisters drove the bus until I got it in '94.  Man,
&gt;I'm getting old.  LOL  Anyway, yes, I need to keep her and pass her on.  I
&gt;was just feeling like someone else could love her more.  But I know that's
&gt;not possible.
