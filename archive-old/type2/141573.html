Subject: RE: [T2] Stock Muffler setup - parts required

&gt; I've already purchased and received a stock style muffler
&gt; (kadron, purchased from a list member) and I'm trying to
&gt; make sure I've got all the parts I need on the way....
&gt;
&gt; Is it correct that I need one damper pipe and one tailpipe? 
&gt; Whats the deal with that?



I hope that this your surprise here is not because the muffler you received
has two tailpipe outlets. If so, then you have purchased a Bug muffler, not
a Bus muffler. 

Here is a picture of what you need:

You can see in the picture where the second tailpipe outlet would have been
if this were a Bug muffler, but since it is a Bus muffler it only accepts
one tailpipe.
