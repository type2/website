Subject: the thing between the fan and the crankshaft

Hi,

I have a '74 Westfalia with the standard 1800 engine.

Since the engine is out, I'm replacing all seals particularly the rear 
crankshaft seal behind the fan.  I don't plan to open the case.

The fan has been unbolted from the thing it bolts to (three bolts) and 
the bolt/big washer thing has been removed from the end of the 
crankshaft.  Now I can't remove the aforementioned thing the fan bolts 
to.  I've tried banging it from behind with a hammer while prying the 
other side with a screw driver and I've tried a light duty puller but it 
doesn't seem to have moved at all.

Any help with this problem will be appreciated.

Jim
