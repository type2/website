Hi There,

As far as I know:

VW produced the Type 1, Beetle,  with the Type 1 engine from 25 HP (late 40's) to
the 1600 dual port FI in 1979 also super beetle, Karman Ghia.  Engine identified
by it's upright fan housing.  VIN starts with 1XX

The Type 2 was the commercial VW, Van, single cab, double cab, and other special
editions. Through 1971, The type 2's were powered by a Type 1 engine, some with
lowered compression. VIN starts with 2XX

The Type 3's were the notch back, fast back, and square backs with a type 3
engine.  Please no flames here.  Back when they were selling the Type 3's, I heard

their engine referred to as a pancake engine.  the basic design is a type 1 engine

with the oil cooler laid on its side to the left, and a rear engine mounted fan
with cooling tin at a very low profile to fit under the cover of the type 3's
engine bay.  Carbed to 67 and FI to 1973. VIN starts with 3XX

In the early 70's(?) / late 60's(?) VW introduced the bigger type 4's.  4 door
sedan, fast back, and station wagon.  These vehicles were equipped with the new
designed type 4 engine, 1700 cc.  It was needed to push these heavier cars
around.  At the time of their introduction, the local VW dealer referred to the
engine as a suitcase engine.  VIN starts with 4XX

The VW designed  sports car, sold in the USA as a Porsche 914, was equipped with
the type 4's engine as were the Type 2s beginning in 1972.  A side note, the only
&quot;914s&quot; with a Porsche name attached in europe were equipped with the 6 cylinder
2.0L Porsche and designated as such with a chrome trim piece reading
Volkswagan/Porsche on the rear facia panel.  If you find a European &quot;914&quot;  The
word Volkswagan is embossed in large letters across the front facia panel.

Since &quot;The Thing's&quot; VIN starts with a 181, I'd guess VW based it mostly upon the
Type 1 series.  RMMW catalogs the Things engine parts as being Type 1.

The Type designation of the various engines seems to be associated with the
vehicle chassis type in which they were first installed.

Anyone else remember the type 4s?

&gt; I have a 78 Westy, 2.0 L engine w/FI. The reference to &quot;type*&quot; has me somewhat
&gt; confused. I believe I have a type2 body style w/ a typeIV engine. Is this
&gt; correct? What is the difference between a Type2 and TypeIV engine? This may be
&gt; elementary to this knowledgeable list , but is confusing to me.
&gt; Thanks for the help.
