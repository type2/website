Subject: Need 68 Firewall Tin

I need the frontmost bit of shrouding for a 68. I'm replacing my hack job
made of printing plates and JB Weld. But all I have is 71 tin, and I think
it's Beetle tin at that. I've had two wise people tell me that the tin for
the 68 is different where it meets the body in the front--more squared off.

If anybody has this spare please let me know. I don't care if it's rusty or
ugly.
