Andy askes:
Did you get the Pertronix that was made specifically for the 009 and 005
distributor? 

- --not sure if this is the case, but I did tell the guy at the VWFLAPS that it
was to go into an 009.


Then he informs me:
One other minor point... don't get mad, but JC Whipme sells 'em for $49.95

- --figures, but I bought it on a spur of the moment, and probably would have
talked myself into waiting more, if I had decided to go pricing. Besides, it
helps support a very friendly and cordial VWFLAPS.
