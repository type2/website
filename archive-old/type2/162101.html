Subject: Re: [T2] front beam redux

Hi Tony,

Interesting that you would mention the left hand side rust... I  
repaired the same thing on my bus last summer.

I'll be listening on that one.


Happy Trails,

&gt; I'm swapping out a front beam...Whilst it's on the bench
what's the consensus (if any) for rust treating (light sur-

BTW, the old beam was very rusted on the left ( LHD Bus)
but very not rusted on the right...Any theories... ?-(
