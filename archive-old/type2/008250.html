Howdy Type 2 folks,
             I was wondering if somebody out there might know how to
obtain the birthday of my bus. I read a while back on the list that
someone was referring to the day that their bus was built and sent off
the assembly line.  Are their some numbers that I could retrieve such as
my chassis number, then match it with something out of a publication or
on the Web maybe?  Sure would love to know that, for my own piece of
mind.  Also, I'd be interested in finding out where it came
from....before it arrived in the U.S. and in my garage.
                  Thanks to anyone who knows,   Kevin  Snow
                                                                 ex ' 69
