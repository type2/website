HI Dave,
That is exactly where mine are.   It sounds great unless the bus is full of 
stuff.   People are OK, it is just when I pack heavy for a vacation that I 
can't hear them at all.   The rest of the time it is great.
Peace,
Rob

&gt; Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone ever install a pair of speakers under the 3rd seat in the panel
&gt; that goes across the bottom?
&gt; 
&gt; Did sound any good at all?...or total waste of time?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks ,dave
