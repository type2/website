To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Mike,

The tire size is correct, BUT, were they C rated with reinforced sidewalls?  
(basically truck tires?  

EVERY bus I have ever bought initially came with the wrong weight rated 
tires.  The size was correct, but they were all car tires, not the correct 
C/truck rated tires.  Its tough to put VW's suggested rear inflation pressure 
of 40 lbs in car tires that give you a top inflation of 32 lbs or so. You 
need the correct tires to get to the correct specs.  Thats what will give you 
stability in a 3000lb vehicle.
