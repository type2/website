Subject: The screws are here!!!

Well finally after more than a week and a trip to the local UPS center,
I have in my hands 100 of the 8mm screws used in the bus doors.  (UPS
lost my package).  As I promised last week, I would provide a comparison
of these screws to the originals once I got them and allow everyone to
decide if they are good enough as replacements.

First of all, there are some differences, but for me they are a definite
go!  I will comment why below
------------------------------------------------------------
  Old         New              Measurement
15.95       14.25   mm     Head Diameter
19.50       21.40   mm     Length, end to end
 1.25        1.25          Thread pitch
12.15       15.10   mm     Bolt length beyond the back side of
                            a door bracket
 none        zinc          plating
--------------------------------------------------------
COMMENTS:
- I'm happy with them.  The smaller (1.7mm) head diameter allows the
bolt to sit slightly lower into the material that it is holding.
- The hole for the phillips head screwdriver is designed for a larger
screwdriver (a plus in my dept.)
- Both of these differences would only be spotted by the most critical
of the BNs.
- The zinc plating looks quite nice, any shinier and it would be chrome
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I ordered these from:
Molloy Fastener Co.
714-D Shelby Lane
Austin Tx 78745
512-326-8255
512-326-8331 fax
mailto:mary_at_mfast_dot_com

The part # is:  M 8 x 1.25 x 20  DIN 966
The package of 100 cost me $18.90 + 4.00 shipping.
They will ship anywhere in the world and have no minimums.

Dana was a great help in getting my order together and it was on the way
to me the morning after I called.
