&gt;All indications are that this is the original, factory interior.  Any
&gt;guesses?

My '77 Westy has exactly the same layout. It was converted (when new) by the
dealer who fitted a standard Westfalia DIY package to a bus. This was done
after the bus was about 6 month old. The reason for doing so was in the tax
regime at the time in Holland (factory fitted campers were taxed higher).

I believe the interior is identical to buses fitted in the factory. It's
called the &quot;Helsinky&quot; layout by Westfalia.

In my case you can see that it was originally a plain transporter because of
the paint in the cargo compartment (dull grey/brown in stead of exterior
colour).
