Someone please tell me which front doors are interchangeable with my 1976
westy?
I just bought a rust free passenger door from a 1972 that the seller assured
me was compatible with my 1976(&quot;I have been working on vw's for twentysix
years and believe me, it will fit.&quot;) Well guess what? It does not fit!  The
hinges seem to line up, but to work on the 1976 I need the threads to be on
the door and not the frame. Is this clear? or just confusing? aaahhhrrgghh!
I was hoping that someone would respond to the list concerning parts
interchange-68 thru 79 bus but I can't wait any longer. I thought that 74-79
would interchange. Then this guy confused me by rubbing his 26 years of vw
experience in my face by insisting that this door would fit. Now I am just
confused...
TIA,
andy  76 Westy(The Avacado)
