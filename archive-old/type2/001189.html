&gt; &gt; Help I need to replace my fuel filler neck on my 78 Camper. NLA from VW.
&gt; &gt; Any sources as every used one I've looked at is shot as well.
&gt;
&gt; RMMW still has em listed in their catalog, assume Bus Depot has em as well


Actually, none of us do, at least for now.  The only source for this part
was VW in Germany, who discontinued them last year.  I got the last few they
had, imported them directly from Europe, and sold them out within days.  We
are looking into whether there is a Brazilian alternative, but so far no
luck.
