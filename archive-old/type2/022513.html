Ok..if you have disc brakes, the rotors are not &quot;true&quot; and the wheel bearings
are loose..the wobble of the rotor finally pushed the brake pistons back in
the caliper...the speed at which the rotor touched the pads helped overcome
the friction of the square cut &quot;o&quot; ring seal....
over the short haul, the rotor doesn't have a chance to really shove 'em back
in...just a few miles and you shove the pads out and the rotor has to start
over again....
I know this sounds loony.....but I've seen it....
The *other* reason could be a dragging brake that overheated the fluid in one
or more wheels..but that wheel would have been hot to the touch..and you would
have noticed it in a bus....
