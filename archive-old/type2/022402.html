Thanks for all the replies - there were over a dozen so I figured I would just summarize to the list.  Thanks to the suggestions I received, I found several articles from the NHTSA, Customs, and others that were very helpful.  

Here are the basics of what I found:

  There are companies (Registered Importers, or RIs) that can handle the importation for you.  There are basically two parts to it.  One is EPA certification (emissions) and the other is DOT (Safety).  A 94 Eurovan is on the DOT eligibility list, which means that it is at least possible to upgrade it.  That's the only good news.  It still has to be upgraded and it could be costly.  For the EPA certification, the one RI I checked into charges $5,000 for testing and certification, not including any parts needed such as a catalytic converter.  You can avoid paying companies like this if either 1) you have an EPA sticker on your van somewhere (probably the engine compartment) stating that the vehicle conforms to US EPA requirements (unlikely), or 2) you can get a letter from Corporate VW of America stating that the vehicle meets US EPA requirements.  Being German spec I think it's unlikely you could do either one.  A couple of things you will need for the DOT inspection, your speedo m
ust indicate mph (can also indicate kph), your odometer must be labeled KM, your doors must have side impact braces, your brake lines, windows, bumpers, etc. must have DOT approval stamped into them.  You must have a catalytic converter and possibly an OBDII (OBD-2) computer.

I think the RIs are geared more towards people with deep pockets looking to import exotic/expensive cars.
