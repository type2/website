Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring a tow lighting harness into the bus

Chuck,

IMHO, you are trying to make things difficult for yourself.

Trying to tie the lights and such into the bus wiring is going to be 
difficult.....be easier to buy magnetic tow lights and wire and plug them 
into the car you are towing with.

Cheers, dave

&gt;  Need some insight on how to wire the lights of a 79 loaf to be towed.
&gt; 
&gt; I would prefer not to use external tow lights. I have searched the archive
&gt; and cannot find any suggestions, so here goes:
&gt; 
&gt;   Where do I hook into the running lights, brake lights and turn signals?
&gt; 
&gt;   At the fuse box? Or at the switch? or ....? Any special hints or advice?
&gt; 
&gt;   Any guidance would be appreciated.
&gt;
