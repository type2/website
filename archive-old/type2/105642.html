&gt; With only a week to go, I haven't seen anything on either list about a Carabus
&gt; to Everybus from N. Virginia/Wash. DC. I've heard from most of the Canadians,

well I plan on leaving early Friday but plan on going down the eastern
shore of the Potomac on 301 from Baltimore over the Lower Potomac on the
&quot;nice&quot; bridge

&gt; sounds like they will be fewer in numbers this year, and some are coming down
&gt; a day earlier. I don't know if I'll have my usual backyard campout again this
&gt; year-shame too, it's usually the most excitement Round Hill Virginia gets all
&gt; year! Anyway, as in years past, my daughter and I (and anyone who shows up at
&gt; my place)  plan to leave early (9:00-9:30AM) Friday, taking Rte 15 over to Rte
&gt; 29. We've met up with folks at the Sheetz gas station in Opal, Virginia, right
&gt; where Rte 17 intersects Rte 29. We should be passing through Opal around
&gt; 10:30-11:00 AM. If anyone wants to join us, please email me!   Jeff

probably running parallel to each other at about the same time, but there
is no way I'm going thru DC at rush hour, would have to go out 70 and then
down thru Winchester to catch up with you, maybe 100 miles further 

see you there
