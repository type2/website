Subject: Re: [T2] doing push rod tube seals this weekend

I like myself even less when i have to pull a valve cover.  I use the 
brown sealer to hold gaskets on to them.  Works fantastic.  But is not 
fun to remove later.

&gt; Richard,
&gt; I used some engine oil on mine.
&gt; My favorite on the gaskets is to use 3m weatherstrip adhesive on the 
&gt; valve
&gt; cover side only ...applied sparingly.  Make sure that where the gasket
&gt; will go on the heads that the heads are absolutely spotless and flat.
&gt; Took me about 45 minutes each side when I did this last(damn PO).
&gt; Do not *ever* use any sort of rtv on the gaskets!
&gt; Cheers, dave
