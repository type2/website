&gt;HOLD ON A MINUTE! DID YOU SAY   R  T  V SILICONE?
&gt;
&gt;I would not use that as a gasket sealer on anything related to body work
&gt;or sheetmetal. It causes an oxidation process that  will prematurely rust
&gt;whatever it is applied to. Someone put that around the edge of my front
&gt;wind screen on my 69 t2 andit is rusting through.

It is a vicious corrosive. Somebody put it around my windshield and it made
my ROCKER PANELS rust through! And I think it is making my hair slowly turn
grey, too. And every morning I find that there is less water in the dog's
water bowl than there was the day before. That silicone is wicked, wicked
stuff.
