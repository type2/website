And lets not forget Harley's attempt to patent their 'sound'
I mean really, what does a motorcycle broke down at the side of the road
sound like?

&gt; I don't know if Ford is as protective about their logo with the T-Bird
&gt; crowd, but Harley-Davidson employs a virtual army of lawyers to harass
&gt; anyone using their logos. Harley's devotees approach religious fanaticism
&gt; regarding the marque, but that doesn't stop H-D from releasing the flying
&gt; monkey lawyers on shops such as &quot;The Hog Farm&quot; in some jerkwater burg. I
&gt; wouldn't be surprised if their lawyers try order tattoo artists to pay
&gt; licensing agreements or try to collect royalties from the Hell's Angels
for
&gt; member's tattoos.
&gt; Perhaps the old joke: If Harley had as many engineers as they do lawyers,
&gt; maybe they could build a better bike, could be adapted to VW for their
heavy
&gt; handed tactics.

&gt; &gt; My Friends,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [snip]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do we need to do this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [snip]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did you know that &quot;escalator&quot; was once a registered trademark?  And
so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were &quot;aspirin&quot;, &quot;trampoline&quot;, &quot;refrigerator&quot;, &quot;yo yo&quot; and many more!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they failed to take precautions that would have helped them have a
&gt; long
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and prosperous life as registered trademarks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [snip]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What a load.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You'd think these people at VWoA would be happy there are so many folks
&gt; &gt; who have nothing but positive intentions toward the VW brand.  If this
&gt; &gt; has already been asked, please forgive me, but I don't believe I've
&gt; &gt; heard of any other car-maker who is targeting enthusiasts in this way.
&gt; &gt; Is Ford, for example, trying this with the vintage Thunderbird crowd?
&gt; &gt; I'd be *really* surprised if they were.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe someone should sue VWoA so these lawyers have something to do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe VW is trying to make their legal department a revenue-center now?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;Lawyers Wanted&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Enjoy,
&gt; &gt; --
