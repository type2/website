Subject: The Baja Run (?)

The Baja Run

The idea of a run to Finistierra -- Land's End on the southern tip
of Baja California -- grew out of a campfire conversation at
Inuvik, just after Tobin &amp; Krista held the 'awards' ceremony.  It
was about midnight.  The sun was still up.

Throughout the Inuvik trip I'd kept up a running joke about going
surfing when we arrived.  Now that we were there -- and the surf
wasn't -- someone asked what I planned to do.  &quot;Head for Cabo,&quot; I
said.

It was a joke!  Our homeward trip would be southward, obviously
heading in the direction of Cabo San Lucas.  

&quot;Count me in.&quot;  Jack Stafford swigged a swallow of his homebrew,
nodding his head in confirmation.  It was a warm night and the
mosquitos weren't too bad and Jack was not drunk.  He was serious.

The subject of a Baja Run came up again at Boya Lake.  There was
Eddie and me and Jack and Jorge &amp; Yvette.  I was showing them how
to properly douse a campfire, Baja-style.  We convoyed south
together on the Cassiar the next day and camped together at
Stewart, British Columbia.  It was our last camp together.  Jack
and Jorge &amp; Yvette were heading for Prince Rupert and the ferry,
Eddie &amp; his dad and me were taking the Poor People's Route, up thru
the Lake District then back down Highway 97 to the states.  It was
rainy and cold, the wind chilled by the glacier just above our
campsite, so cold even Yvette wore clothes.  We talked of Baja and
surf and sun and beaches without footprints.

Since then the idea of a Baja Run has been nagging at me, along
with several of the Inuvikerrs.  You can have a lot of fun on a
good run to Baja, where there's lost missions to be found and
sunken treasure to be dived for other interesting things to do. 
And there's worse places to be than Cabo San Lucas in the
summertime.  Once you pick up the pace of things in Baja, which is
generally slow, there's always something to do, night or day.  The
surf really isn't that good, except for a few places, and the ocean
is really a little to warm for good fishing, but you manage to get
by, one way or another.

I'm going to run down to Cabo next July.  I'll probably spend
fifteen days on the run, border to border, mebbe more.  Gas, food
and what-not, I'll probably spend twenty, thirty bucks a day, mebbe
less.  The side trips will be determined by how many newbies are in
the convoy, people who have never seen the painted caves or the
alabaster mines.  But mostly it will be a prolonged beach and
fishing party, with much of the time spent near the Cape where July
temperatures are about the same as on the beaches of southern
California.

Why July?  No tourists, or at least not too many of the geezer
variety, with their sixty-foot motorhomes and satellite dishes. 
Geezers own Baja in the winter, filling up the camps and inflating
the prices.  In the summer there are plenty of places to camp and
most of the campers are more adventurous, more interested in the
country than in playing pinochle or watching soaps. (Geezer-ism is
a state of mind.  It has nothing to do with age.)

The other reason for July is because that's when we arrived at
Inuvik.  One year from the day, I'm going to swim thru the Arch at
Land's End.  

Anybody want to come?
