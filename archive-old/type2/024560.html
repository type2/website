X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I recently pulled a bunch of FI stuff off a 79 Bus 2.0l engine. The engine
went to a guy who installed it in a 73 Bus. So it is free for the taking. I
have both intake runners, plenum, wiring,and all the other engine mounted
stuff. No computer or AFM(AFC? Airbox). It is free, just come and get it. I
am in the Tacoma Wa. area. I hate to ship it and could not promise when I
could get around to it, so I would prefer to give it to someone local.
