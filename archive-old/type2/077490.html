Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof solutions for former poptop campers??

I knew you'd find Street Beat. Just FYI, those are the
two installations I've seen that sagged. Also, I had
what I wouldn't call a bad experience with them, just
one that is illustrative of their attitude and level
of knowledge, which led me not to purchase from them.
