this again was taken engine cold ...
this carb will not shut flap that is until the linkage is pulled from the throttle on the carb and you kinda touch the carb throttle a bit or give it a little and it clicks and you hear it and se it flap close... or at least loosen....
 
here is the left hand side carb also taken cold and it is shut like should be........

even though the choke isnt i am sure causing the problem here this is a problem....however...
the spark plugs i am going to try to fix here shorlty....
going to try to readjust the mix....after engine gets good and warmed up./././
hope it dont throw the balance off on the carbs,,, i took back the flow meter i borrowed at picasso moon...

Yup, they do look a little(lot) rich, and you are
right it could be the mixture, jets, and choke, one
you can mark off is the choke, take the breathers off
and watch them to make sure they open when warmed up.
after that make sure the mixture control screw is set
right, I believe it's in till it drops then back out a
1/2 turn? (both sides) After that, it's down to
changing the main jet sizes till the plugs clear up.
you were right, better rich than lean. If you change
the jets be sure to put the same size on both carbs.
Good luck with it, maybe someone else has a better
idea. Phil
