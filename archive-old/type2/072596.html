Subject: Re: Exciting new bus feature
Message-Id: &lt;v01510102b39135e0f604_at_[207.172.54.235]&gt;

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;In an effort to make owning a bus more fun, VW engineered in some time
&gt;delayed features into my bus. The latest feature is make its appearance is
&gt;&quot;hi-signals.&quot; This is an exciting new feature where upon fully engaging the
&gt;right turn signal the high beams come on. On the lucky occasions when the
&gt;self canceling feature works this phenomenon reverses itself. This feature
&gt;is not dependent on the headlights being switched on.
&gt;
&gt;A quick review of wiring and dimmer relay did not reveal the method by the
&gt;hi-signals operate. A closer inspection is in order but I just might wait
&gt;for Fox to do a special on buses: &quot;VW Bus Secrets Revealed.&quot;
&gt;

Chris:  A suggestion, but not an easy one to follow:  The high beams on my
'71 Westy would randomly go on during a drive.  In frustration, I wiggled
the cable bundle that runs into the steering column and found that the high
beams would go on  or off.

A look at the circuit diagram and reading the archives led to an
understanding. The high beams are toggled on or off when a certain wire
leading into the relay is grounded.  Touch that wire to ground once  -
high beams go on and stay on.  Touch the wire a second time  -  the high
beams go off.  No need to hold the wire to ground, just touch it. That's
the way the relay works.

I ended up moving the steering column away from the dashboard,
disconnecting the turn signal switch, following each wire by color code,
and sure enough the brown wire mentioned above had a bare spot where it had
been rubbing on the metal brace.  I covered it with heat shrinkable tubing
and cured the problem.

Not an easy job.  Not even the only reason for intermittent high beam
problem. But something to try.
