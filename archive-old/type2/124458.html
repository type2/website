Subject: Shipping a bus

Kind list,

Found a bus.  Made the deal.  Sent a deposit.

The next step is a way to ship said bus to the east
coast.  I searched the archives and found some info
on the joys and perils of transporting a vehicle.  But
many of the posts were from 5-7 years ago.  I'm hoping
someone who has done this recently can offer me some
information and advice.

The bus is going from Arizona to New York.  I have a flexible
time frame and a budget.

Thanks ahead of time.
