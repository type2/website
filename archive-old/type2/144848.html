&gt; For you folks out where they have these places, how much does it cost?

&gt; For instance, If I wanted to go out and pull an alternator off of a T4
&gt; engine, would they quote a price before I pulled it? or just when I got
&gt; ready to leave?

They normally have a board with all the parts prices posted.  This can be
a bonus for some aircooled parts, since a fan shroud (a relatively complex
part on an aircooled) is priced the same as the plastic radiator fan
shrouds on watercooled cars.
