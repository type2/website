&gt; &gt;I was doing some work with a guy who had been a auto painter (and who had

&gt; &gt;good car paint job should require at least $500 in paint. Otherwise he said
&gt; &gt;that you might as well DIY with a spray can. I think he was joking about
&gt; &gt;the last part but I am not so sure.

&gt; Tough to get enough paint on a bus with a rattle can, tough to get get 
&gt; enouhg paint on there fast enough to cover uniformly, etc. etc.

I used a Sherwin Williams product in a high end Duplicolor sold as Custom
Color one step auto finish....about $7-8 a 11oz can, a can would cover
maybe 2sq ft and at two coats plus primer I used 4+ cases of the
stuff.  rattle can but deffinately not a cheap paint job,  has lasted
better than 10 years though...one advantage of this kind of paint job,
couple years ago my bus got graffitied on the drivers side,  I had the
paint sanded, primed and repainted inside the day, never had to drive it
with the &quot;X&quot; rated comments on the side....

my bus was painted this way for reasons other than $$$ or equipment since
I have all the spray guns etc, and I don't think the paint itself would
have cost much more than I spent on rattle cans, and it probably took
longer...I just could not take the van off the road for any time during
this period, so it was a &quot;Paint and drive&quot; operation
