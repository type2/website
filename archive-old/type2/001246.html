    Hi All..

I am ironing out the kinks in Caroline...and her main problem right now is
the infamous hot start.    Here are the symptoms and what I have already
done..

At one point she cranked over very strong and started everytime..idled
great..

Had the clutch done and since I have been having problems...

Right away I noticed her cranking power was low (new battery)...So I
installed the hot start relay.    It cranks pretty good now hot or cold.

When hot she won't fire up.  I pulled the plugs and they are bone dry.  So
I'm not getting gas.

Someone suggested vapour lock, and asked if the fuel line was touching
anything hot..indeed it was, but not anymore and still no hot start.

I have a fuel filter between the pump and the carb.  Sometimes it is full
(no air), sometimes it is empty.  When the engine is running I see a few air
bubbles going into the filter, but not all the time...so the pump is pumping
air?

Finally, when hot, it will jump start everytime with ease, and likewise she
starts when spraying &quot;Quick Start&quot; into the air cleaner.

For a 1600 SP, Caroline has amazing power, +70mph, with strong acceleration.

She has been idling a little low lately, sometime stalls when hot.  I
recently set gaps, adjusted timing                 _at_ 0 deg TDC and idle
(before clutch job).

Any input would be greatly appreciated, the archives covered some things but
I would like some advice from you guys..and gals.

Thanks Allot
