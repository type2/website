&gt; Yesterday on San Diego CA KUSI TV news they had a segment showing a
&gt; Bay burning up on the freeway. The camera crew got on scene just as
&gt; the fire department was beating down the flames. The van was totally
&gt; burned out, tires burned off of the rims. It was a sobering picture.

And in light of this post, what would be involved in installing a fixed fire
extinguishing system in the engine and fuel tank compartments on a Bus?

I checked an online racing products dealer who has non-Halon fixed
suppression systems for racecars (racecars are a big market for this kind of
thing) for around $350, which is reasonable. Comes with a rechargeable 10-lb
bottle of suppressant agent, the regulator, a big handful of nozzles, hoses,
a 9-foot release cable (they'll make the release cables in any length you
want)--everything a growing boy needs.

You'd need some sort of a fire detector, though--what would you use? This I
don't know. We print Walter Kidde Aerospace's aircraft fire systems parts
catalog, and they've got fire detectors that would work on a Bus, but no one
would put a $21,000 fire detector in a Bus. That's not the only detector
they've got, but it is the cheap one. A household smoke detector wouldn't
do; those go off when they see (IIRC) 180-degree temperatures, and a Bus
engine that's running cool gets hotter than that.
