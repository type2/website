Kim,

I used to live in Portland as well (for 14 years), and
I had the problem you describe on *every* single
vehicle I owned during that time ['69 Westy, '89 Ford
Probe &lt;don't laugh...at least it was fast&gt;, '83 Nissan
P/U, 2-'74 Merc. Capri's, '89 Hyundai &lt;ok, laugh&gt; ].
ALL of them had this problem!

In every case, it turned out to be corroded battery
cables or connectors. Granted, they always *looked*
passable, but it turned out they weren't allowing
enough current to properly charge the battery,
ultimately causing a premature battery-death.

Check your battery cables...if there's *any* green
showing on the cable itself (and I bet there is, in
that climate;-), I would start there. If the battery
is seriously drained; jumping it probably won't work,
as it's not going to hold a charge anymore (in my
experience, anyway).

I don't know what it was about the humidity there, but
I bought more batteries/cables while living there than
anywhere else I've lived. I averaged new
cables/battery at the *most* every 2 years!!!!

I also tried using anti-corrosive grease and felt
gaskets on the battery terminals, but never saw a damn
bit o' difference...
