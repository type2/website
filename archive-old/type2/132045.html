Subject: Re: [T2] Removing a late-bay ignition lock cylinder

on 4/23/04 13:54, Richard Atwell related:

&gt; The lock cylinders are very similar to the older ones but the mounting is
&gt; slightly different. Maybe this is useful to you?

that is the page i had seen before.

the procedures for a late bus are nearly identical, but the components are
different, as you said. the hole you drill is in a different place. the
procedure is also in the bentley, and covers late bay bus, no?
