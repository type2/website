Hi,
       Sami Writes:

&gt; I have yet to fabricate sheetmetal to place around the engine in order to
&gt; seal off the engine bay. Someone suggested I use fiberglass instead of
&gt; metal: good idea or bad? (btw, it's for a '75 bus).

 The articles I got from Joel (thanks again..) 
suggest that you should be able to use
the 911 tin if you trim it. This will leave a small 
gap across the front (FIF) of the engine bay
which can be filled with some flat sheet metal 
curved to fit the space.
 Fibreglass would certainly work but the photos 
suggest that the sheetmetal approach would 
probably be easier- It looks like it would just take 
a little work with cardboard templates and
tinsnips to shape the metal (Aluminium?) and 
then some pop-rivets would hold it in place.

 I've also read that the heat exchangers  are 
close enough to be useable with some work
and that a stock (911) exhaust can be used with  
some trimming of the valance+bumper. Can you
confirm that? 
Finally- where did you get your engine 
hanger/mount from?

Cheers,
              W.
