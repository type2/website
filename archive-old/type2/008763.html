At the risk of confronting a lot of LOL-ing...

I rebuilt my '76 engine, using new rod bearings, new camshaft bearings, 
used pistons and jugs. As rebuilds go, it is not intended for more than 
10,000 miles. I want to replace the p&amp;cs and heads rather quickly and the 
bottom end in dues course (with a '78 and counterweighted crankshaft).

Anyway, I got the thing back in the bus and started my 20 min. break-in 
at 2000 rpm. The fan popped off after 10 min. It had sheared the dowel. I 
put it back on, torqued down the bolts, and tried again. It popped off 
again. I replaced the spring washers with locknuts. It popped off again. 
So back to spring washers, plus a healthy slather of locktite. Now all 
seemed well. I got it out on the road at within 0.1 mile off comes the 
fan. Damn! This time it sheared all three bolts and made a real mess of 
the hub. But worse, I discover that the flywheel was loose too! It was 
not turning with the shaft. More like a freewheel, you might say.

This, of course, is very disappointing. I _know_ I torqued the nuts to 
eighty pounds (with a bar torque wrench, 1/2&quot; to 3/8&quot; adapter).

Does anybody know what I might be doing wrong?

Okay, start LOLing.
