Hi Volks!

Alex, I hope this answers your PM to me as well.

In my friend's conversions, the radiator(s) is/are located inside
the engine bay, to the sides.  He uses pretty hefty ventilators
(and a bigger alternator and battery to power them), and there's
no problem with overheating.

Airhowlingly yours, (and is this on topic? I'd say so)
   Erik.
