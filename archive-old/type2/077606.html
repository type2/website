Subject: RE: [T2] RE: Coils

  I had a coil that was failing in a Mercedes. (Bosch Blue) It ran fine
until it warmed up then it would miss regularly. I was working for an older
guy who said that if it only missed when warm that was the first thing to
try. Replaced the coil and that was it.

Yo Mike,
As I understand it, the flame begins to appear yellow as opposed to blue,
but...........
I've never had on in &quot;failing&quot; mode,
just have had them in &quot;failed&quot; mode.

The symptom for &quot;failed&quot; mode is the engine stops running. :-)

One failure resulted in one heck of a &quot;BOOM&quot; and black smoke came out the
tailpipe as I coasted over to the side of the road.

Of course, Zorm might act differently, as he would, most likely, fly over
to the side of the road.
