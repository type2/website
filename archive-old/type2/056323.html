Subject: more than enough

the old computer took a dump so ive been off the list for about 3 weeks (64
new messages) but in that time i mananged to pick up some new wheels.
1968 bus.  no interior except front seats.  just one dent and two small
patches of rust.  straight bumpers, 1500 motor (i think) faded baby blue.
doesnt run at the moment.  has a chrome belt strip around the whole bus
below the windows.  has original owners manual and a 1974 printing of john
muirs book. 

1974 campmobile. no pop top.  looks kinda funky, but its actually in fair
shape.  has the groovy green/blue plaid upholestry.  has factory tape deck
and 4 6.5 inch pioneer speakers.   owner said it has a 2000 in it, but not
sure.  some sort of single carb conversion.  runs good.  183000 miles. 
never had a type 4 motor before, but i like driving it.  its odd to put
your foot down in 4 and have some discernable acceleration.  had a bentley
in the glove compartment.  with that said, anyone have some 74 camper
parts?   i need front seat covers and the black handles on the cabinets. 
or anything else i can find.

bought em both for 600 bucks.  drove the 74 home, towed the 68 behind the
farm truck.
