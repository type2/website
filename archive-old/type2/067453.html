Subject: Re: First engine pull

&gt;I'm waiting on pins and needles for the thread to spin into yarn on this one,
&gt;especially since I've sucessfully pulled the engine on my '72 (with type IV) 4
&gt;times  in the past 6 years without supporting the transmission.

You just let it sit on the drive shafts? How far did it drop before they
stopped it? It's always seemed to me that you could do this without hurting
anything, but it isn't difficult to tie it up so I always did because I WAS
AFRAID. =:o
