Dear Sir:

Volkswagens don't LEAK !
They mark their SPOT, like a DOG or a HARLEY ! (Harley Davidson motorcycle).

Are there no leaky volkswagens where you live?

cordially,
Dave Wolfanger
p.s. wipe it up, hose it out, whatever.
you might try pouring some oil into the heater boxes (and stand back-
or go for a drive ! )
