Hey, I'm a novice at engine work...and so far my track record's not that
good. But even from my inexperienced perspective, VW engines are precision
devices with specific tolerances. If the rebuilder doesn't pay attention
to detail, they're not going to build a reliable product. It doesn't take
very many mistakes to create an engine with a built-in wear cycle. 

On the other hand, I tend to believe that even a novice with the right
tools, time, and attention to detail, can build a reliable, well-running
VW engine.

In fairness to myself, my bus has never left me stranded, and most of my
problems stem from inexperience...or work I had done by someone else...or
lack of skill in adjusting the carb and timing.  Plus, I probably err on
the side of caution and I have no fear of pulling the engine to
investigate unsolved mysteries...and once I'm there, I might as well...

An old VW'er near me once said that you have to build three to drive one. 
Maybe there's some truth to that for some of us, but by the time you get
to the third one, you will be independent of MOFOCO, GEX, and all the
other rebuilders out there who don't care as much about your ride as you
do. 

My $0.02. Thanks! Joe
