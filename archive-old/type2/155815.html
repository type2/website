Subject: Re: [T2] new heads, need advice (was indeed a floating valve
  seat)

Now, if i do that, do I need to roughen up (hone)
&gt; the cylinders again so the rings seat in again?
&gt;

I would, just a bit with the fine compound. Just to be sure. It's a
good time to inspect for any compression leaks. They're pretty obvious
once you get the cylinders and head separated. A black patch at the
mating surface.

&gt; Do rings move as the engine is running, or do the find a groove and stay
&gt; there when breaking in?
&gt;

Yep, though you won't notice until the ring gaps meet. It's a very
rare occurance, but when it does you're suddenly burning oil like mad
and have next to no compression on that cylinder. Especially if they
happen to meet at the bottom of the cylinder.

I wouldn't hone unless the cylinders are shiny and polished looking,
or there are only lengthwise markings with the crosshatch left by the
honing no longer visible. If that was the case, I'd worry about how
much cylinder had worn off, and consider replacing them as a minimum,
or the pistons and cylinders as a set. Especially if the hone marks
were worn away in patches.
