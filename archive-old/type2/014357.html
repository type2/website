Subject: Re: [T2] Spare tyre


&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; A quick question that's been puzzelling me for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; The spare tyre of my bus is mounted on the front of it. Where do you keep
&gt; your spare if it's not mounted up front? Does it depend what equipment
&gt; you've got inside, or is there some secret hiding place I've missed :)
&gt;

Hi Paul,

As you're in the UK, your bus is RHD, right? I also presume that you have a 
camper conversion, if the spare's mounted on the front?

If you open the rear hatch, and lift the rear cushion/mat, you should find on 
the LEFT side, against the window, just inside the hatch, an indentation in the 
rear shelf where the spare tyre will sit in the Kombis, Microbusses etc. As my 
only bus is a camper, too, I'm not certain what the retention hardware is, to 
keep the spare there, but that's the default location for the spare.

Hope this is of use.

Regards,

Neale
