Hello thought I'd throw out my two cents worth for your consideration.

So you say the '73 has an upright engine with extra sheet metal in there and 
it looks different than your '68???  Of course it does!  Sounds like 
someone's pancake engine went out and the only thing they had laying around 
was an upright motor. The extra sheet metal is to seal off the engine 
compartment and to help prevent overheating. That's whole idea of air cooled 
engines- to keep the heat off the bottom of the engine from getting in the 
engine compartment.  Incidently, I have heard that some 72 and later 
European buses came with uprights and had factory tin that allowed them to 
seal off the engine compartment like it's supposed to be.

You also asked how many miles are on your bus and if it's the stock motor. 
You can look up the engine code letter and see if it's the right year, but 
you'd have to do more research to see if it is the same engine it was 
shipped with. IMHO it doesn't really matter unless you had a special model 
or edition that was all cherry and ready for restoration and shows. But if 
it has a lot of rust as you say and the slider door doesn't open and you are 
planning to drive it day in and day out whether or not the engine is the 
original is really only a novelty.

Did you do a compression check?  Another opinion of mine is that the number 
of miles on the engine is not all that important compared to the compression 
results.

As far as advice on whether or not to buy the 73, I tend to agree in theory 
with the other list member that often it is better to spend the cash you 
have on the bus you are driving.  But I must say that while it can be argued 
that one bus that runs is much better than two that don't, especially when 
one needs to get to work... I might still buy the other bus just 'cause I 
can't stand to pass 'em up.

That's all.
