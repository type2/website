Subject: 71 westy for sale

I hate to do this, but unforseen events are forcing me to sell the bus.  The
run down:

This is a red 1971 westy. The body is in good shape, with no major body
problems.  There are a few places with minimal surface rust, but it could be
easily cleaned up.  The bus drives really well.  I just had the distributor
replaced and the rear brakes re-done.  The only catch is that the interior
has been ripped out because I was getting ready to put in a new floor.  All
the parts are here though, cooler, sink, jump seat, and fold down bed, and
they are all in excellent condition.  The pop-top is old, and there aren't
any major rips, but it could be replaced.  The cot is also in great shape.
The bus also has all the curtains, including the curtain that goes up in the
front.  There is the original stereo, and a &quot;working&quot; stereo that is by the
passenger seat in the front. This bus will take very little to get it in
awesome shape.  It is located in Boulder, CO.  I am asking $1300, but I am
willing to negotiate, because I really need to sell it.  You can p-mail me _at_
michael_r_moore_at_stortek_dot_com or give me a call _at_ 303-665-2293.  

Thanks,

Rawls Moore
