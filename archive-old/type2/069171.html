        An article in Sports Illustrated this week, Grant Hill of the Detroit Pistons talks about 
having wealthy parents. His father was a Dallas Cowboy and his mother was a lawyer. He felt 
uncomfortable about it at school. Hence the following quote:

        &quot;If my parents came to pick me up in a Porsche, I wanted it to be a Volkswagen bus.&quot;


Remember, if it's not Volkswagen, it's crap. (From a local dealer ad.)
