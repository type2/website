Your piston is most likely fine. Just cosmetic damage.

 Pulled the engine, pulled the head.  valve seat

 Any suggestions on what I should do about
 the piston?  The connecting rod could have
 been damaged.  The piston was slightly
 damaged, but it doesn't look like it is enough
 to change performance.  It isn't cracked.
