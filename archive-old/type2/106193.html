I've always had better luck with the 5&quot; Vise-Grips. NOTE:  Jan-u-wine 
Vise-Grips.  Accept no substitutes. Clamp 'em on as tight as you can get 
them, then while applying a twisting force, tap the head of the bolt 
with your 16 oz ball pein hammer. Finese will get it out. Brute force 
will just make more work.
