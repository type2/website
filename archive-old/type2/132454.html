Subject: RE: [T2] New dual carbs. Linkage binding.

Paul,

How about installing a thicker intake manifold gasket? This should provide a
little more distance between the carbs. You could stack two gaskets to make
them thicker. Use care in tightening the intake manifold studs if you do
this; there's a chance of deforming or breaking the ears off the manifold
when there's a lot of squishy gasket material underneath.  I had this exact
same problem with some dual Dellorto's I installed on an 1800, and this was
my solution. The original thin steel gaskets were WAY too thin, and using a
thicker composition gasket solved the problem.

Is your hex crossbar aluminum or steel?

&gt;
&gt; Ok, I'm in the process of setting up some dual weber ICT's on my
&gt; 1700. I got the kit from aircooled_dot_net. The hexbar linkage
&gt; appears to be just a smidgeon too long. It fits, but ever so
&gt; barely.

snip

&gt; Should I: a: grind the bushings down a little on each bracket?
&gt; b: Grind the hex bar down, ever-so-slightly?
&gt; c: Remove the jam nut from one side of the linkage which would
&gt; make it 1/8&quot; shorter?
&gt; d: Just replace the throttle springs with some that are really,
&gt; really TIGHT?
&gt; e: Grind down each jam nut until they are even thinner than they
&gt; were originally
