Subject: Re: [T2] Correct 15&quot; MB or Audi rims for acceptable offset

Make it simple, please?

If someone has a bus which takes &quot;stock&quot; 14-inch wheels, what 15-inch  
wheels will fit, either with or without (and PLEASE specify!) adapters!

I think this is what the masses want to know.

(At least, I do)

Or does this thread alread exist, and I have made a complete arse of  
myself?

(Wouldn't be the first time, thank you.)

&gt; What is strange is that GoWesty offers the nice chrome hubcap ring and
&gt; mentions their &quot;15&quot; steel wheel&quot;. Perhaps they just dropped the

&gt; their site. A call to them should clear it up. It was there last  
&gt; month.
