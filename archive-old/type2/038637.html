As the other listees, I'm sorry to hear of your (possibly) major problem. 
Lets hope it turns out better than your mechanic so far indicates.

Frank and Kathy brought the doormobile in question to many campouts in the 
SE over the last few years..most at a considerable distance from their home. 
They are friendly, layed back people, who have an obvious love of busses. 
I've only known them a few years, but I seriously doubt any intention to 
deceive, whatsoever. Unfortunately, especially with old Vdubbs, Que sera, 
sera .

Hope it works out well for you, and hope to see you at some campouts this 
spring, summer and fall. (Check the Circle-ur-wagons website, 
particularly)..see you soon.

Marv Krupp..who usually buys them described as &quot;it's that POS out back&quot;..and 
would love to be able to afford an &quot;as is&quot;.....
