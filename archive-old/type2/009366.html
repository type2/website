Richard Todd Perry asks:

&gt;He removed the FI system and installed a carb (a -28 or -30, the current
&gt;owner can't remember which). I guess my question is -- is this a good
&gt;thing? 

My rule of thumb is this: if you have to ask, then you need to stick with 
stock. Either look for another bus, or be prepared to restore the fuel 
injection on this one. It is difficult enough to learn how to take care 
of a late bus engine when it's stock. When there are strange changes that 
Bentley, Muir, Haynes and Wilson don't cover, you are really in the woods.

Also, you say that you can't have a look at the bus. If a PO swapped FI 
for carbs, be prepared for other mods (there will probably be an 009 
dizzy rather than stock, for starters). 

On the other hand, if you are looking for an education and cost is not an 
object, buy this bus.
