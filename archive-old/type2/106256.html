Subject: Painless Wiring??

Hey guys,

	I'm going over the entire car.. and I'm trying to fix my new 73 Bus
up so that.. it CAN be a weekend warrior.. but one that I can drive! and not
one that sits pretty in a garage.

I was considering going with the painless wiring system. The original wiring
harness is nearly 30 years old now, and who knows how many times it's been
hacked into. What would you guys suggest? Would painless wiring be a decent
solution? 

I'd love to hear from anyone that's done any kind of a complete wiring
harness conversion.


Thanks,
