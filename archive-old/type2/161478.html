Subject: Fuel smell

Dear Listees

After having our bus (76 2 litre dual carb) entered in the 38th  
National 'Bug In' held
for the first time in Tasmania (Easter  weekend) I came home to
find that the charcoal cannister had broken free from the overhead
mounting (2 aluminium rivets).

So a five minute job to replace the rubber 'tee' piece in the same area
tiurned into a morinings work to disconnect the cannister, empty it,
clean every thing up and reinstall it.  so far everything is OK.

However, (theres always a 'however'), since then we are suffering
from a fuel smell both inside the cabin and engine bay.  I have checked
all the fuel lines the best I can, checked the dual carbs, plus anything
else i cauld see or feel to no avail.

The smell is quite strong even when standing next to the air intakes at
the rear of the bus.  At this stage I am not gaime to drive it more than
the 500 metres up to the building site of our new home and  back
again in case everything gets too hot &amp; I suffer a fire.

Any suggestions appreciiated
