Subject: white bay/vanagon in spartanburg  sc area

just curious i was on my way to work going down hwy 221 in spartanburg yesterday and i seen a very clean looking early model bay painted white and looked original...
didnt have a back bumper i noticed as it passed..

looked like it had either 2 brown stripes on the bottom of the windows or orangeish brown...

also seen a white vanagon around 80 year?

off hwy 9 yesterday.....in boiling springs and then seen a blue karmia ghia this morning comeing down hwy 9 


sorry was excited cause i never see the older type vws and air cooled around my area.. well refrase that i never see them on the roads LOL...

sure nuff be glad to be back back up and running..
i am currently driving a 95 buick with a/c and tottally nice car but if my bus was runnning i would park the buick in a heart beat...

wish us luck by christmas hope to make that come true.. LOL./.
course by then i will not have any heat LOL&gt;. 

 missing my bus awful...

if the bus's i seen yesterday are any one off the list just wanted to say high...

peace
