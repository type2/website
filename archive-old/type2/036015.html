Sayeth Doktor Tim &lt;doktortim_at_rockisland_dot_com&gt;:

&gt; My experiments with vacuum bleeders is, you must typically remove the
&gt; bleeder and pack the threads with grease or sealant or you can draw air
&gt; bubbles through the threads. Note when you pressure bleed a system you
&gt; almost always get some weepage out the threads. The treads don't seal.

I second that - it took me a while to figure out that this was why I 
kept getting bubbles my first time out with the little plastic (Mity-
Mite?) vac pump from the generic FLAPS (under $30).  I wrapped a 
piece of teflon tape around the bleeder screws and it helped.

Jury's still out on the effectiveness of this thing, but it may be 
inexperience.  I think a willing helper with a patient leg is still my 
favorite method.  (Oh!  But we're talking about brake bleeding!)  The 
&quot;submerged hose end&quot; method just used too much fluid for me, 
although if you're sucking air past the threads with a vacuum pump 
you'll go through almost as much :-).

I broke one of the tangs off on the reservoir almost immediately &amp; 
now have to hold it down to keep the vacuum from escaping and 
poisoning my neighbor's dog.  Need to fab a replacement from a 
pickle jar and a couple of bulkhead fittings.
