&gt;We should really start spreading some facts here,,,, There IS NO new rule

&gt;the regs clearly say EXEMPT!

&gt;This confusion will continue as people hear it sooooo many times they 
&gt;think it is TRUE...
&gt;
&gt;IT is NOT TRUE.... Westfalia installed propane cylinders are EXEMPT!
&gt;
&gt;And I have been told that they do NOT have a retest date either,, so YOU 
&gt;CAN refill a 30 year old cylinder that is permanently mounted horizontally 
&gt;on a RV...
&gt;
&gt;I recommend you have a new valve installed if you can,, and use soapy 
&gt;water to check for leaks, But please keep telling the filling station 
&gt;attendants to check the regs if they tell you they can't
===========================&gt;
Jamie, and others .................
Please read my original post.
I am talking about a propane cylinder other than a horizontally mounted 
late edition Westy propane tank.
My tank is a totally separate camping item that I specifically selected to 
complement my 1970 bus camping activities.
A 1970 bus does not have a &quot;factory&quot; tank.
