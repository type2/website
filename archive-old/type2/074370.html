Subject: Travel Info

I just got done with an all weekend general maintenance and tune-up on my
bus in preparation for a winter getaway at the end of the month. Thanks to
all the information I've gleaned from the list over the past year, I knew
what to look for and what to do about it when I found it! You guys are the
best.

I expect to be in the Panama City, Florida area and I'm wondering if there
are any good VW parts stores around there. Anybody know?

Thanks in advance,
Dave
