Subject: I'm hitting the garage door!

I need to lower my  Riviera at least an inch.  When I drive it into  
the garage of the new place, the roof scrapes against the garage  
opening.

So before I totally screw this up, I need pointers on how to do  
this.  I am planning on installing new shocks, can they be adjusted  
to lower it alone?
