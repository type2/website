Subject: Thermostat / missing tin
Date: Mon, 23 Jul 2001 12:23:12 US/Mountain

&gt;and still no one knows if it is safe to hook up my thermostat, 
&gt;without having tin under it

Hi Bob,

The question is really not &quot;Is it safe to hook up my thermostat without having 
tin under it?&quot;, but rather &quot;Why haven't I replaced the missing tin?&quot;

The short answer to your question is, yes.  It is safe to hook it up without 
the tin.  

The explanation is as follows:  The tin serves 2 purposes.  It protects the 
vulnerable pushrod tubes (and thermostat) from road debris.  It also helps the 
thermostat monitor real engine temp by reducing the flow of outside air (vs air 
from the cooling system) and minimizing cooling of the thermostat from road 
moisture.

On a really cold, wet (snowy?) morning, your thermostat might open 5 minutes 
later than it would with the tin in place, but if the air temp is that much 
cooler, it won't matter anyway.  By the time your engine is even remotely warm, 
the thermostat will have plenty of heat from the motor to be fully open.
