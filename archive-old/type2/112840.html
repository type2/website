Subject: ATF filler tube question

hey Volks, on my 79 Auto tranny Westy, the ATF filler tube is one
piece.  Every pic I've seen (including ETKA) shows a 2 piece filler tube
which seperates somewhere near where the engine and transmission join. 
I wish mine were that way because when I want to remove the engine only,
I have to remove the entire tube necessitating draining the
transmission.  Do I have some kind of strange setup or were 79's like
this.  Would a 2 piece tube fit?  (if I could find one)...TIA  Greg
