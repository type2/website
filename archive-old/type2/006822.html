So, if I understand this test correctly, if you had a pressure guage you
could screw into the spark plug socket and a way to stop the engine from
cranking right at TDC, you could watch the pressure and listen for leaks if
any existed.

Could you use some sort of T connector to run from your air compressor to
the cylinder with a valve in between to make sure any leaks in/at your air
compressor don't affect the reading.

I'm excited to hear that you MIGHT be able to make this tool for $50.

BTW, does anyone on the list actually own this tool?

Joe
