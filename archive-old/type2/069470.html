Subject: And another thing!

A special thanks to all that replied to my Mr. Vanagon post. Your comments
and suggestions were all very helpful. My Vanagon has been running fine
since Thursday night. I really didn't find anything out of place, after
going over everything that I touched while doing the engine pull. I did
unconnect and reconnect all electricial connections (sometimes even giving
them an extra squeeze with the plyers.) 

Thanks again everybody for the speedy replies!

You can pick your friends, and you can pick your nose. But you can't roll
your friends into little balls!
