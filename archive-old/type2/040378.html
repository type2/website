Subject: Re: 1st engine pull this weekend

Shelby:
while the prospect looks exciting, and might
simplify the follow-up , insofar as the exact
nature of your problem is still unknown, it is
nevertheless confined to the cylinder head
and/or piston/cylinder ,and for that reason, it
is not necessary to remove the engine to
achieve the repair.
the teardown can be performed w/ the engine
installed, and reassembly as well. granted, it's
a little restrictive (HAHA) , but possible.
and for some unforseen additional problem, the
engine itself could still be removed later.
this is my own personal theory, you can take it
or leave it, but i've done it, it's so much more
direct...
either way, you're gonna need the best pair of
jack stands you'd be willing to bet your life on,
you only get one chance to avoid being a statistic here,
make sure you can jerk your bus pretty hard without
falling off them, especially side to side...
