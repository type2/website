 In addition to Peter's excellent advise (Bentley manual is a MUST!), you can do a quick check of the mechanicals by unsnapping (i.e., pulling away) the decorative sliding inner panel (several body panel clips at the front only) from the upper sunroof (outside body) panel.  You can then slide the decorative panel back into the roof independent of the sunroof.  Check out all the mechanicals Peter mentioned.  If your cables are shot (and it doesn't take much to strip them!) and you cannot find replacements, you could go with a pre-'68 look and get a Brittax or other after-market cloth sunroof to cover the space.
