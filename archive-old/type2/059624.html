'71 loaf

I need to get the cap for the windshield washer fluid fill spigot that has
the little pressurizing tube/nozzle on it.  I have catalogs from RMMW,
West Coast Metric, BFY Obsolete Parts, and Mid-America, and they don't
seem to have it.  Does anyone know who might carry this replacement or
have a spare? :)

Also, I'm going to think about trying to fix the hand brake cables myself.
Do I really need a specially modified five-foot-long length of steel pipe
in order to get the rear brake drums off?
