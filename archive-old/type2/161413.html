Subject: Swiss Cheese!

I brought out the angle grinder today and my body work supplies to  
touch up a few paint bubbles at the bottom of the door.

Well, the bottom of the door looks like swiss cheese, and the lip on  
the door is thinner than aluminum foil.

So I'll be looking for a replacement front passenger door for my 77.

If you happen to have one sitting around, and are willing to let go  
of it ping me.
