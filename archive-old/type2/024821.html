Subject: Carb Problem
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 72 bus that has a Single Weber Carb on it and it back fires when I 
let off the gas completly.  My mechanic (who I decided not to use anymore 
because off things that the mailing list has told me and for personal 
reasons) told me that it was the carb and it can't be fixed because it is not 
a VW carb.  If its not to hard of a job I'd like to try and do it myself.  
Can someone please help me.  I new to this kind of work so if your replies 
can be as detailed as possible I'd appreciate it.  

Thank You,
Jon
72 Bus  Delilah

P.S. I would also like to thank all the people on the mailing list for 
helping me out. Thank You!
