Subject: FS: Very Clean 69 Bus, KC

Hi All,

Over the lunch hour I saw an extremely clean 69 for sale.  

It's a medium blue California hardtop camper, chrome bumpers, all trim was
*very* shiney. 1500 4speed, 85k miles.  It has an L-shaped cabinet inside
with a little sink, etc. Very, very clean, *no* signs of rust anywhere.
If this is your dream bus, it may be worth it (I guess):

$6900  (913)649-6404
