Subject: 76 bus help!!!

hey everyone,
need a little help. I have a 76 bus and I'm putting in 72-74 heater boxes and 
 exhaust I can only get out 4 of the 8 studs holding the old pipes in the 
heads(2 on each side)  due to alot of rotting on the nuts. They are misshapen 
and no matter what socket I use it seems to be either too large or too 
small.(metric and standard measures) If anyone has had this problem before I 
would love to hear some suggestions as to how you removed them. I would 
prefer not to drill and re-tap the holes. thanks for the help.
