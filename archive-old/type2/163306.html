Subject: Re: [T2] Electronic ignition

I have exclusively used Crane systems for the past 30+ years (back into the
days when they were known as the Allison) on any VW originally equipped with
points (and one Toyota PU too).  Installation is easy and straight forward.
I have also tried the Pertronix, Compu-Fire and Accu-Fire, but I never was
happy with their lack of reliability, so I've stuck with the Crane,
something that works and works very well.

&gt; Hi to all,
&gt; I have a 1970 Westy with a 1641 motor, stock carb, Engle 100 cam, 009
&gt; dizzy and a stock exhaust from a 1600 bug. I've seen several electronic
&gt; ignition systems advertised and was thinking about upgrading.
&gt; Is the deluxe Compufire with the coil packs for each cylinder worth the
&gt; $225 price? Would the Pertronix system work as well given my engines' state
&gt; of tune? Anyone have any experience with the Crane system sold by Bus
Depot?
&gt; This list is a great service a big &quot;THANKS&quot; to all who make it possible.
