Subject: Re: [T2] Turbo Bus update

Didn't we talk about this already?  :-)

I'm not sure I agree that the fans are not rated for continuous duty. 
Most cars run the electric fan continuously when the A/C is on, which 
can be hours on end.  That said, I agree with your suggestion to have 
two fans, and I definitely intend to do that.  The Quantum has (I 
believe) a two-stage sensor on it to control the dual fans on that car, 
with the second fan only coming on when it gets very hot.  I will try 
and re-use this system if possible.  I will also have manual overrides 
on the fans, just in case.

&gt; If you're putting the radiator in the engine bay, it might be a good idea

&gt; designed for continuous use because most of the time water-cooled cars
&gt; have sufficient frontal air to the radiator.
