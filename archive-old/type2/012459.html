Hi everyone,
Is this the type of 12 volt heating pads/ bedwarmers
that folks are thinking of getting?  I don't have a
Rocky Mountain Motorworks Catalog handy, but I found
this page in the Backwoods Solar catalog.  They are a
reputable outfit selling solar and other small scale
energy related stuff that I have done business with. I
have friends who have used these in their off-grid
home for years with satisfaction.

Hope this helps someone.
