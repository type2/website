Hiya Mick,

A little tip in installing the seals.  Place them in their grooves WITHOUT 
any adhesive.  Check for a good fit.  And drive around for a few days like 
that.  They will not fall out or cause you any other big-time problems.  In 
those few days the seals will &quot;adjust&quot; around so that there are no tight 
spots or areas in which they are all bunched up.  Then take your adhesive 
(3-M is good stuff) and glue them in without removing the entire seal from 
its groove.  Just do sections about 12 to 18 inches at a time.  Your seals 
will like you for this.  And you'll like the results.

Mike
