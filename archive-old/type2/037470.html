Hey folks..

The move happened, fairly well.  Network Solutions should have things
updated soon, as well.

Problem is though, our upstream provider has nto gotten the IP record with
Arin working, so that our IP will not reverse...

This means that most of you wont get this message, or any message from the
lists.

But i'm trying.;p  No ETA yet.  when it works, you'll know rather quickly.


later...david
