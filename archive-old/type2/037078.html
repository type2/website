Subject: Westy Post card

Hi guys.

     Today I  found something neat in the westy with 1/2 a seized engine :)
I was thumbing through the original manual and tucked in the back page is  a
neat standard size post card with a picture of a early westy with submarine
hatch. In the foreground there is a family , the child is playing with the
dog, and the parents sitting at a small table. What makes me wonder about
this post card is that on the upper left corner on the back of the card it
says P.A.R.C. Archiv-Edition copyright by VW-AG  Wolfsburg and in the middle
of the card it says made in Germany which is 90 degrees to the  rest of the
writing with a line off either end which creates a boundary between where
one would normally write and where one address the postcard. Anyone know if
this was a vw dealer type of thing or is this just another post card? I
think its real cool looking. well all for now
