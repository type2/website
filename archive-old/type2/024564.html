X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello all,
  I am looking for type 4 engine parts. This would include all 72-83.5 type
2's ,411/412's and 914's engines. I am interested in engine tin, exhaust
parts, any part of the longblock assembly, and clutch parts. I do not need
fan shrouds, FI stuff or Autotrans parts.
  I am not looking to spend a lot of money, I am just collecting parts for
upright convertions. I would love to come clean out your old junk. I do not
care if the engine is blown, trashed, seized, or rusted. Parts can be good
bad or ugly. I am mostly looking in the Wa. state area, but if you have
something I need I may pay for shipping out of my area. 
  Free is a great price, but I will pay for the right stuff. I will take
most anything.
  I will also look at other VW aircooled engine stuff, mainly fan shrouds,
pulleys, and tin. 
I am wanting to start doing type 4 upright conversions for pre 72 Buses and
Bugs and need these type of parts. 
Thanks,

Scott Solomon AKA &quot;VW addict&quot;
