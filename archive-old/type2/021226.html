Subject: Re: [T2] Rocker arm stud


Yeah, 10 ft-lbs is what it should be for a Type IV.  I was graced with a
mangled stud by following Wilson's instructions to torque the rocker arm
studs to 18 ft-lbs.  I knew I should have double-checked with Bentley,
but that's what ya learn (and it seems in the past few days some of us
have been learning lots...).

&gt; 
&gt; Advice? Replace the stud. Don't know of any way around it.  My 2.0L rebuilt
&gt; head had a stripped rocker arm stud right out of the box so I went to a
&gt; parts store that I get a lot of parts from and he let me salvage a few from
&gt; the cores he had not sent back to the rebuilder.  I now have a couple of
&gt; spares.  Replace the old nut also because it may be damaged and it will
&gt; continue to cause problems.  They only torque to like 10 lbs or something
&gt; and they are very very easy to strip.  Good luck.
