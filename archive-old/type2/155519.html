Subject: Leaving tomorrow for Cali...

Prepping the Guac:
Pertronix
Set timing (have a borrowed scale from Busted Bus until I can find my
plastic one...)
Swap some cheap summer tires for the kickarse Nokian snow tires (save those
babies)
Oil and filter change with Castrol 20w50 and a Mann filter
Install my H4's
Install the fog lights that were rusted to the old bumper
Check valves
Replace squealing front brake pads
Check heating system for leaks

Spares:
Throttle cable
Clutch cable (and bits)
Points set
Coil
Fuel filter
Fuel line
Oil
Wire and various tape
Moly grease
Gloves and hand cleaner (heh)

Misc:
Tunes
Toys for my 3 year old
PSP and DVD player for the 15 year old
Cup holders front and rear (rear one is cool and has a trash bag holder too)
12v Electric cooler for milk and drinks
Regular cooler for everything else
Blankets and pillows
Aspirin for the inevetable headaches from a squalling 3 year old

Anything I'm missing? We're leaving tomorrow after my son gets out of
school. I'll drive until 10 or 11 then find a motel. Then see how far I can
get on Saturday...

This is an emergency trip to California due to a death in the family, so my
brain isn't all here. That's why I'm asking for suggestions. Thanks!
