Subject: Re: '71 beam on '68

Britt:

Sounds like a great DC. Where are you located? I am in San Jose CA.
Did you put the '71 discs and trailing arms on the the '68 beam or did you
actually adapt the '71 beam on to the '68 chassis? If you adapted the '71
beam onto the '68 chassis please tell how!!! I have alway heard '71 and
latter beams will not bolt up to the '68-'69 chassis (different bolt
pattern or something like that).Even in the Bus Boy catalog they seperate
there beams as '68-69 and '71 and latter. I have a '68 single cab that I
would love to do this modification on and would like to hear how you did
it. I am also interested in your DC as that was what I was looking for in
the first place!
Thanks Vic

&gt;I regret to list my DC for sale but other projects take priority ( flame
&gt;suit on) . It has a 71 front disc. beam on it with matching drums at the
&gt;rear. Visually from the outside it looks like a 71. The body is freshly
&gt;painted white and this is a Calif. bus that did have rust in the passenger
&gt;rocker. I cut it out and replaced the 3&quot;X6&quot; section with good German metal
&gt;(donated by my 68 squareback) and painted the bus. It is about a 5' paint
&gt;job (looks good from 5') but if you look closely you can see some of my
&gt;poorer body work. It was a work truck and the gates I left alone so they
&gt;have many dents in them and are slightly bowed out in the middle ( about 1&quot;)
&gt;. The bus is a daily driver with current licensee. It has a rebuilt 1600 Sp
&gt;in it (universal case I think). The interior is average with the seats in
&gt;very good shape. It needs the rear door panel replaced and the vents on the
&gt;dash are broken. The steering box is shot and needs to be replaced. Tires
&gt;are about 75% left. The van comes with a spare 78 transaxle with axles,
&gt;aluminum side step and various bus parts. The exhaust is a dual
&gt;quietpack,other than that it is stock. I'm located in Calif. 50 miles south
&gt;of Sacramento.
&gt;Price is $3800 cash or $2000 and trade for a Rabbit Convert or Scirocco16V
