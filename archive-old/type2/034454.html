Subject: Carb and dizzy question

Esteemed listees:
 
I am posting to the VintagVW and type2 lists, with the hope that someone can identify this carb and dizzy set up.  It came installed on the 1700 T-4 in my 72 Bus.  The carb is a single as opposed to the stock dual set up, apparently a 2 barrel progressive.  Can't tell if it's Weber, Holley, what have you, as I don't know how to tell the difference.  The number on the base at the rear is R9877.  I searched the Type2 archives and didn't find a reference to this number under Weber or Holley.  Also searched several websites looking for a cross reference chart but didn't find one. Holley's site lists model numbers, but I didn't find a 9877. 
 
I noticed while adjusting valves that the dizzy has a single vacuum line to it, but the mark for Number 1 cyclinder is at the &quot;front&quot; (FIF) say about 11 o'clock, rather than at the back as I expected, and as the picture in Muir shows.  In fact, it looks more like the Type 3 dizzy in the Muir book.  The Bentley pictue to me is not all that clear.  The number on the distributor body is 326.  I'm not familiar with this, as my only other experence is with the 009 in my Beetle.  What I found was that if I hooked up the spark plug wires to the dizzy using the mark as number one, the engine would not run.  Change them around to where they &quot;ought&quot; to be (One at the &quot;back&quot; and Three at the &quot;front&quot;, 2 and 4 accordingly) and it runs, though the timing is off.
 
Which brings me back to the carb.  To set the timing, I tried to figure how to adjust the idle, and couldn't see where the heck to adjust anything.  Before I go looking for a manual for the carb, though, I need to figure out what I have.
 
Any help?
Mike
