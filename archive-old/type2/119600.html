&gt;     I'm curious exactly how I can remove the crank fan? I see that it's

&gt;can get enough force to undo those three crank-fan bolts? I'm hesitant to
&gt;use the center crank bolt... what have you guys done in the past to
&gt;replace a crank fan?

You can see the tool in Bentley. It's a c-shaped circular plate that goes between the hub and the case and with the screws you turn it into a puller. You can probably make up something very similar.

&gt;Also, I noticed on my GEX rebuilt motor, there is a little circular tab
&gt;with a dot in the center. All around the dot it says &quot;WARRANTY VOID IF
&gt;REMOVED&quot;. In the center of the dot, there seems to be some blob of
&gt;aluminum in there or something. I seem to recall a thread a while back
&gt;about this, that, if that turns red, it means my engine overheated. If
&gt;it's NOT red, does that mean my motor has never gotten to significantly
&gt;high temperatures???

It's a standard engine builder (not just VW) technique to protect themselves from bozos who overheat their engines. What I don't understand is why GEX puts them on in the first place since they don't honor their warranties.

Don't engines run a little hotter during the first few thousand miles anyway esuring they will fall off? :-(
