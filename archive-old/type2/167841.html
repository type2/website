Subject: Re: [T2] How embarrassing...

&gt;Please consider the purchase of a CO2 extinguisher...

	The reasons marshalled so ably by Teri justify a stronger 
conclusion than that!
	Ifyou'd seen the mess made by a powder extinguisher, you'd be 
willing to invest a few $ in the reliable, multi-use carbon dioxide 
type.
