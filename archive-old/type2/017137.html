&gt; Eventually Jewel started performing regularly at the Inner Change
&gt; coffee-bar in Pacific Beach. Word soon spread of this talented young
&gt; singer/songwriter and soon she was playing to massive crowds, people being
&gt; turned away as the place filled out. She began to get mentions in the
&gt; local press and soon the record company fat-cats were driving down to the
&gt; little coffee-bar and off to her little camper-home to try to woo her.

Gee, those hippies still livin' in VW buses out there in P.B.? They were
when I was livin' there in '67 but I thought the city fathers might be
gettin' a little tired of that by now! Two months was enough for me,
maybe I'm not as slow a learner as I thought!
