Speaking of front wheel bearings:

Does anyone know of a source for the OEM VW, amber-colored wheel bearing 
grease?  That stuff is downright amazing.  It seems to hold-up as well if 
not better than the Valvo synthetic that I'm using right now.  BTW, I agree 
about carrying a spare set while traveling.  I would just add that if you 
pack them beforehand and wrap 'em tightly in plastic-wrap, they'll be ready 
for install when you need them.  :^)

&gt;&gt;I hear this all the time and it saddens me.  Buses were made for road
&gt;&gt;trips!  If your bus is in good shape it is far less likely to give you
&gt;&gt;problems on the road than it is around town!  If you drive sensibly (keep
&gt;&gt;speeds under 60, take your time on hills) you will not be stressing your
&gt;&gt;bus as much as you do on the way to the supermarket.

&gt;The one exception to this is front wheel bearings.  Check them before
&gt;leaving on any long trips and take spares.  Other than that, I agree, get
&gt;out there and drive!
