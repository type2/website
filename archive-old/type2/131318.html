Subject: Re: [T2] Early Bay Rear Bumper - What year bus??

Hey, I just 'scored' a set of Vanagon rear window jailbars on Sunday.

Of course, the bars are too long to fit my '78 Westy, but I can think I can 
easily cut the aluminum bars to size.

Other than a pipe cutter thing or a hack saw, are there any other ideas out 
there to cut the aluminum bars (hollow tubes).

By the way, the Vanagon rear window jailbar lower tube is slightly longer 
than the upper tube.  This is also the way on the bay rear window jailbar 
tubes.  When they were on the rear hatch, there did not seem to be a 
difference, though.  I guess I am missing something.

There was also an early bay rear view mirror with the long stem.  I left 
that because the actual mirror part was dry rotted.  You can't be too 
careful, you know.
