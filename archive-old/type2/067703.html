Subject: Who needed a 1600 dp Bus case...?

I lost the original post...

        in going thru my stuff and rearranging the shop for winter...

        I came accross a 1600 dp &quot;AE&quot; case that I think came out of a bus... it
has 3 tapped holes on the Oil pump end of the case...
        one on either side of the pump housing and one on the bottom...
        
        is this in fact a bus case...

        looks in really decent shape... no crank tho... it has been split...
        
        not worth much too me as I do later Westies and Vanagons...

        $25 + shipping...?  does that seem fair...??


        might also be picking up a complete '73 camper... w/ brand new never
been installed ATK reman 1.8L type II motor sitting in the back.
        This is an Automatic.... anybody out there need a Tranny and/or an
engine...??

        The canvas is perfect, almost brand new so it's going on my '73 and the
interior is in much better shape so it will probably also be used in my
camper... but there will be some things availible...
