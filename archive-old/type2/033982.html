Subject: Fuel Pressure??

I have a 1971 Westy with a 1600cc dual port and a 31 Pict brosal carb with an 
electric fuel pump. I was wondering what the fuel pressure should be or what 
can the carb and the engine handle. Right now the fuel pump is putting out 
3.5 to 4lbs of pressure is this to much? Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks
