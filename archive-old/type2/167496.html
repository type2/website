&gt; &gt;where I get my tires (NTB) always torques all tires on all cars to spec, I
&gt; &gt;had to show them the spec for my bus in Bentley because they didn't have
&gt; &gt;the numbers in their computer.  they have special wrenches they use to
&gt; &gt;tighten all lug nuts.
&gt;
&gt; They typically set them to either 80 ft.lbs or 100 ft.lbs because their &quot;torque sticks&quot; only come in those two varieties in the sets they buy.

and I never let them use those on any of my vehicles, they use a regular
clicker type torque wrench
