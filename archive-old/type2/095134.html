Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)??

Thanks Karl...I think that was the most informative reply I've ever recieved 
on a mailing list or message board. I'll do as you suggested. :)

&gt;You really need to call around and get a price for a new one before you 
&gt;decide
&gt;to test yours...... and you need to be sitting down:)
&gt;

Oh great it's one of those kinds of parts...oh well I'm kinda used to it (I 
also have a Corrado, try getting prices on parts for it.)
