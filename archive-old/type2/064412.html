&gt;&gt;On the down side, they sent the wrong DIRTY oil cooler.  As the other 
&gt;&gt;parts appear to be first rate, they get the benefit of the doubt.  I 
&gt;&gt;expect that they will be as horified about the dirt in there as I am and 
&gt;&gt;replace it promptly.  

Yep, they are making good.  They told me to throw the dirty one away and
will UPS a new one today.  No hassal, no questions.
