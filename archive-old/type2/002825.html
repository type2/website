&gt; I can't find anything on how to adjust the idle down on a AFC injected
type4 engine- not even in my Bentley.  Seems like it might be some kind of
adjustment for this... anybody?

There is a screw in the base of the throttle housing about the size of a
dime. Use a large straight blade screwdriver. It will be at a slight up
angle and points to the rear of the bus. You can see it pictured in the
Bentley, section 10, page 14, figure 4-10.

BUT.....it you have any vacuum leaks between the throttle plate and the
intake valves, you will be getting false air and the idle speed adjusting
screw will be useless.
