Subject: Thermostats A-Z

I've been researching thermostats recently and I'm wondering if anyone knows
when the thermostats changed. This is what I know so far:

- 111-119-159 36HP Type 1 version (long time NLA)
- 111-119-159A Type 1 64-74 (65-70C)
- 043-119-159 Type 1 FI 75-up (80-85C)
- 021-119-159A Type 4 (85-90C)

What I'm not clear on is exactly when the the temperature range changed on
the bus. All the parts books I've seen say the thermostat changed in 72 but
I recently pulled a 65-70C unit from a 72 bus with VW markings and a 11/1971
production date.

I find it unlikely that such an old thermostat would have been put on this
bus later but it is possible. Perhaps it was a mid year change? The 411/914s
also used the 021-119-159A thermostat but based on the part number and
timing it would appear to be a replacement part for those models.

Has anyone seen the earlier thermostat on a 72 bus?
