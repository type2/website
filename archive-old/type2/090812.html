Subject: Re: [T2] Just ordered from Bus Depot

Courtney:  Brazilian master cylinder from Bus Depot for 29 dollars new!! 
I got one a while back and it took about 30 days, some foul up, not
exactly their fault.
Courtney:  400 bucks down the drain, as no insurance on it. Doh!!
That is one of the great thing about Credit cards, if you don't get the
merchandise you can get a credit on your bill. Check it out and some
credit cards provide various levels of insurance.
Courtney:  I never thought US Mail would actually require insurance. 
Optional.
