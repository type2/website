Subject: Re: [T2] license light - Karl?

Hiya Java,

Interesting you should be asking about these parts.  I have a question and an 
observation.

Question..........is the license plate light assembly a universal part for 
68-79?  Or does it change dimensions (or something) somewhere along the line? 
 Karl, are you out there?  Can you answer this one for us?

Observation......the two dome lights are not the same part number (in other 
words, different)  The front dome light has a three position switch, the rear 
has a two position switch.  At least, that's the case on a 70.
