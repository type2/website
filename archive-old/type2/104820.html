Subject: Re: [T2] replacing brake booster, how hard??

Hey Daniel,
I recently stripped the brake booster from my parts bus. How hard it is just 
depends. Before you can pull the booster you have to remove the master cylinder 
and resovoir, and the pushrod coming from the front, and of course the front 
belly pan. It's all pretty straightforward and spelled out in the Bentley(you 
do at least have access to one don't you?) The major stumbling block for me was 
unbolting the booster itself. Three nuts came right off no sweat. On the fourth 
I kept turning and turning and turning until I relized that the bolt had 
obviously com loose from whatever was holding it to the inside of the booster. 
My solution was to break out the air chisel and wail on the offending fastener 
for a few minutes. If not for that It wouldn't have been any harder or easier 
than any other job. If you have R&amp;R'ed the engine twice you can handle this. 
Good Luck.
PS-my own question to the list; I may someday want to have this booster rebuilt
(99.9% certain it needs it). Can the rebuilders replace the bolt/stud that came 
loose?
