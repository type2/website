Glad to see that the JC Whitney tradition continues.  20 years ago it
seemed as though half of their stuff was drop-shipped from Venus.  What
you did get was often not in good enough shape to use.  I once received an
order consisting of four H-4 headlight bulbs and a Delco alternator.  They
were placed loose in the same cardboard box with _1 sheet_ of newspaper
for padding.  After a trip through the US postal service the bulbs
consisted of two well-hammered metal bases and glass powder.  The
alternator worked fine, though!

That was my last order and I still received catalogs regularly for the
next 15 years or so.

&gt; I've found that dealing with folks like Wolfsburg Warehouse, Bus Depot,
&gt; and Aircooled_dot_net just make life a whole lot easier.

And better for your bus too.  Cheap parts are often more expensive in the
long run in terms of aggrivation and damage.
