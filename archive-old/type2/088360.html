Subject: RE: Oil Cooler


&gt; &gt;I bought the largest cooler from bus boys and have had great success
&gt; with it.
&gt; &gt;I mounted it underneath my 79 and temps have not gone over 245-250 even
&gt; on 90 degree plus days!!!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Glad you posted this. I'm heading to Baja where temps are often over
&gt; 100, and also have a 79. I have a 1.5 quart extra sump that I have to
&gt; yank because it hangs too low for off-road in Baja, so I need to add a
&gt; cooler. I've been looking at the coolers online and wondering which is
&gt; best. The BusBoys plate style cooler looks good, but they sure don't
&gt; tell you much about it. Would very much appreciate it if you could tell
&gt; me anything you can about it, like:  exactly where and how you mounted
&gt; it,
I mounted it in front of the driver side rear wheel. It is between two of
the cross
supports ( I do not know the technical name for them). The most rear of the
two
cross supports is the one that has the jack insertion point. I took some
digital photos
and will try to post to www.kazmal_dot_net/buscooler.html

&gt;and how you protect it from getting hit by stones, etc.

In terms of protection from rocks I read that this is fairly tough material
and figured I
might get a bent fin or two but .... I guess you could mount a cage along
with the cooler
to the frame??


&gt; Did you use rubber or braided lines? Did you buy the thermostat and, if
so, what are
&gt; the dimensions? How is the thing plumbed into the motor and where did
&gt; you find a protected place to mount the remote filter?

I used rubber. However, several articles I have read recommend braided. I
priced them in one place
and the were very expensive. When I have time to shop around I will
probably replace
with braided. I mounted the remote filter on the fram as well. The plumbing
for a type 4 2 liter
is as follows:
(1)Remove stock filter and spin on oil filter block off which has an in and
out marked
(2) run line from out to remote filter inlet
(3) run line from filter outlet to cooler in
(4) run from cooler back to block off inlet.

I did not buy the thermostat - I live in northern Cal. and did not think I
needed it.
The one thing I worried about was that the run was too long and I would lose
oil pressure. Since I increased the volume of oil ( a little more than a
quart) and
lowered the temp. my pressure gauge is showing nice pressure. I am running
straight
40 weight.

Oh yeah the dimensions are: 96 Plate  (Measurements: 1.5&quot; X 11&quot; X 11&quot;)  &gt;
&gt; Any help you can give would be great. Thanks,
&gt;
