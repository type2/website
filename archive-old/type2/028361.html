John,

I have visited Strictly VW in Irwindale, CA.  Basically two guys, both are
factory trained, do the work.  Shop is clean and organized.  I have never
heard anything bad about them.  The guys are very friendly and that comes
across on the phone.

I have also visited Quality German Auto Parts in Montclair.  His operation
is larger in scale because he used to bring engines in from Germany so he
has a warehouse of old engines, parts, etc.  He's been in business for about
15 years and seems to have a loyla customer base.  The day I was there a
family drove from inland of San Diego to pick up a transmission from the
guy.  Long way, right?  The customer told me he and his brother had
purchased 4 or 5 engines over the  years and wouldn't go anywhere else.
Great loyalty, huh?  The owner is a German and seems very, very
knowledgeable.

SIR is located in Costa Mesa, and I visited there as well.  It's more of an
engine rebuilding factory.  Of the ones listed here, they produce far and
away more rebuilt engines than anyone else.  As a result, they can also make
more mistakes.  There was someone, Angela?, who was having a bit of a
difficult time getting through to them to wokr out a problem with her
engine, but eventually the President called her and things got straightened
out, I think.

SIR
320 E Dyer Rd
Santa Ana, CA
714-549-8628

After visiting these and other places, I decided to have my engine rebuilt
by Elite Motors in Fullerton, CA.  Why?  Because Lenny Coop from West Coast
Classics recommended him.  It took several weeks, but he guaranteed his work
for the usual 12/12 as long as I bring it to him for service.  Quite
honestly, I was very afraid of balancing carbs and knew it was far more
complex than taking out and putting in an upright.  If I had to do over, I
would get an engine from one of the above places and install it myself - I'm
a bit less afraid now.

I would stay away from Fast German Auto.  I ordered a set of fresh air hoses
from them, and they couldn't get something realitvely simple like that right
in two tries, plus I have yet to hear anyone say anything good about them.
I have heard good things about all of the others listed here.

I sure hope this helps.

Phil

    Greetings List!  First of all I would like to thank everyone on the lis
for their help in the teardown of my t4.  Now that everything is in pieces,
however, it appears more work needs to be done than I have the time or money
for right now.  So I've begun to look at rebuilt engines for sale.  I have
looked into GEX and AVP so far.  Does anyone have experience with these
companies? I would also like to get in touch with Strictly Foreign and SIR.
Does anyone know how I could contact them?  Does anyone know any other good
places to try?  Any comments or suggestions would be great.  Thanks for
everything, Pete.
