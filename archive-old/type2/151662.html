Subject: Re: [T2] Multimeter fried?

Nemo,

Lots of &quot;how to&quot; out there

Google for                  multimeter howto use

I personally prefer the analog meters for car work.  When my last one 
died, I bought one from Radio Shack(fairly recently) for about $20.00.

The secret is to get one with the largest &quot;display&quot; for the cheapest 
amount of money.  That way, when you are laying on your back under the 
dash, it is easier to read.

I too have an expensive digital one, but hardly ever get it out of the box 
unless I want to know *exactly* how much resistance in a resistor or 
*exactly*(to four decimal places) how much voltage the battery has in it.


Ususally, when you let the smoke out, it is because you had it set on the 
&quot;resistance&quot; scale and tried to measure voltage with it.  Most have a fuse 
built in that covers that, but old cheap ones did not.



Cheers, dave
