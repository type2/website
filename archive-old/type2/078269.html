Subject: Wanted to buy: FI setup.

Hi all, I am searching for some Fuel Injection gear to suit my T4 engine,
preferably located in Australia.
I am taking part in the Megasquirt project as mentioned previously on the
list so I need some bits and pieces to convert my twin solex set-up to EFI.
Basically I need the entire set-up minus the air filter housing, airflow
meter and  ECU. at the very least I need the following:
Inlet runners
plenum chamber and throttle body
injectors and fuel rails
fuel pressure regulator
cold start valve and injector
temp sensor II
EFI wiring loom (for the connectors etc. as I will be re-wiring to suit the
Megasquirt ECU)
Hmmm, have I missed anything?
If any Aussie list members have this set-up in their shed somewhere or know
of someone that has, contact me off list and let me know at
paulnchristine_at_ozemail_dot_com.au
I will either pay cash or perhaps trade.
Thanks.
Paul
