Subject: Re: [T2] Painting wheels with POR

Beware of powdercoated rims. A Vintagebus listmember wound up getting
loose wheel lugs from the 'crunch' caused by the thickness of the
coating, and subsequently lost a rim, and a bus due to a roolover at
50-60mph speed.
This goes for POR and paint also, check the lug nut torque, and retorque
frequently after refinish.
Also consider removing the finish around the lug bolt seating area to
allow for proper torque against the rim. This would be a solution if
thick coating or powdercoast is used.

Heck, everybody check their lug torques!

Be safe.
