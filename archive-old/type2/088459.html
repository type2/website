Subject: Re: [T2] Westy front Cot

[...]

BTW, even though the bars changed in style and length from 68 to 79, the
canvas is all the same.

&gt; I have an original child's cot (56 1/4&quot;, 3 sided, galvanized = 69 - 73) that
&gt; I retrieved from the boneyard.  It's in very good shape (one tiny little rip
&gt; in the original canvas otherwise nothing else is wrong with the bar or
&gt; stiching).
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to trade it for an original &quot;2 piece, collapsible, 3 sided,
&gt; galvanized = 76 - 79&quot; set or just buy that from someone who doesn't need it.
&gt;
&gt; If no one replies and I can't find anything on eBay in the next month I'll
&gt; offer the pair I have to a listmember next time someone posts on the
&gt; subject.  A friend of mine offered to extend the bars for my 78 but I
&gt; decided it would be a shame to do this to an original cot that would be
&gt; perfect for a 69-73 owner.
