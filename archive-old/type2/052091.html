Subject: [T2] BN4 Dash Switch

I just acquired a dash timer/switch for my BN4. Its # is 311 963 107 C. The
switch is operational but its missing all the knob components:  the light,
retaining ring, black cap and green face. Does anyone out there have these
items - possibly off a non-functioning switch?
Thanks
