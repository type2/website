Subject: ebrake crossbar question

i rebuilt the brakes on the back of the 70 today, and needed some info:
 the right side ebrake works just fine, but the right has never  been good;
now it doesn't work at all :P
i believe that the problem is in the crossbar - it looks like someone has
ground out a much deeper slot than is needed where the crossbar attaches to
the front shoe.  now, this gets tricky here... i have the running gear from
a 72 bus (front disks, different rear hardware than a 70-71), so what i
need is for owners of 72s to measure their crossbars and see how deep that
slot is. alternately, anyone have a spare bar to sell me?

what is happening is that when the ebrake cable pulls on the rear shoe
lever, the lever will hit the hub before it has moved the crossbar enough
to move the opposite shoe out. also, the spring that goes between the two
shoes seems to be interfering with the crossbar.

clear as mud, eh?   if you have repaired a 72&gt; rear brake, this will all
make sense. if you haven't, ignore me :)
