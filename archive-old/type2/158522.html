&gt;&gt; then crack. When I load match-grade ammunition, I

If you quench it you are not annealing it, by definition, and I don't think you could get brass shell casings to the critical point with a common propane torch. Maybe you're tempering them. =^ ) I could be wrong.

I'm fairly sure the liquid in those thermostats is simple isopropanol; if you had enough of a leak to produce bubbles then the alcohol has probably boiled out of it already, or at least there is a lot less of it in there. If there is liquid in there it might just be condensation. If you solder it shut again, it would be interesting to know whether the thermostat expands only at a mugh higher temperature; I would expect that to be true.

Metallurgy is cool.
