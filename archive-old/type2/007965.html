&gt;
&gt;How about the original hooks that came on your bus when it was new.  These
&gt;were located on the pillars behind the coat hook (button).  Most of these 
&gt;have
&gt;long since been broken off.
&gt;
&gt;I bought new ones from Jim at Old Volks Home.  Of course I no longer need 
&gt;them
&gt;since I've installed the retractables.

then once you find or make some hooks, those seemingly useless seatbelt 
winders then have a place.

they're those cream coloured 'things' that take up about 6-8 inches of 
slack out of the seatbelt when you hang it up, and stop if from hanging 
out the door when you close it. (at least that's what I did with mine)

- it took about a year having this thing floating around my bus before I 
found out what it was for. If I hadn't started hanging my seatbelt up, 
I'd never have worked it out.
