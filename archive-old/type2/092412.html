Subject: Charging problems..

Hi,

I have a 69 bus with a 1600 engine and a 38A generator. The last couple of 
weeks it
has been driving me crazy with an electrical problem that I haven't been 
able to diagnose.
The bus was dying on me in the middle of the street and I was loosing all 
electrical
power. I traced it to a corroded battery ground cable. I changed it and the 
problems went
away for couple of days. Now the generator light comes on when I rev-up the 
engine
(accelerating or downshifting) or when I turn on the headlights, turn 
signals and radio together
(i.e. under &quot;heavy&quot; electrical load). This morning it would not start, like 
it has a dead battery.

Any idea what could be the cause?

Thanks a lot for your help.

Rogelio
