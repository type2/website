I spent my spring break driving from Illinois to Maryland, and back to 
Illinois.  On my way home I saw 3 buses.  One was Blue and white, one green 
and white, and I think the 3rd was red and white.  Made me very happy to see 
other buses on the road.  If anybody saw a green and white bus traveling on I 
70 it was probably me. 

 I had a question about my bus too.  As I was driving when I would reach 
about 60mph my bus would start jerking, or bucking I guess you could call it, 
but only when I would go 60 or faster.  Sometimes it didn't do it, but for 
the most part it did.   Any idea why?
