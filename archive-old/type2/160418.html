Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor for electronic ignition

Excellent response - thanks so much Jim! I should have included the info in
my initial email, that this is a 1983 California... so it appears that I did
indeed buy the wrong distributor.

So from your pages, I need to find either of:
VW 039-905-205C or Bosch 0237 022 009Does anyone on the list have any tips
on where to find one? Googling the part numbers doesn't bring up much
info...

I'll be selling the (unused) distributor that I bought from CB Performance
once I get it back from the mechanic. If anyone is interested in saving a
couple of bucks on one, let me know.

Cheers!
Mike.

&gt; Mike -
&gt;
&gt; It would probably easier to answer this question if I knew if your Vanagon
&gt; was:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Air Cooled or Water Cooled? This changed in mid year 1983.
&gt;
&gt; 2.  If Air Cooled, Federal or California Model?  Air Cooled Federal Models
&gt; came with Points, California models w/Factory Hall Electronic Ignition.
&gt; Water Cooled all came w/Factory Hall Electronic Ignition.
&gt;
&gt; It boils down to this.  If you have an Air Cooled Federal Vanagon, the
&gt; answer is probably.  But remember, the SVDA (Bosch 0231 170 034) currently
&gt; sold is designed for use in Upright 1600 engines, it's advance curves are
&gt; close enough, but not exactly the same as the original distributor (Bosch
&gt; 0231 170 093).  In addition the Cylinder #1 Mark on the distributor case
&gt; edging is 180 degrees opposite of the original distributor, so your true #1
&gt; mark is 180 degrees off - you have to file a new mark to reference this.
&gt; And yes, this distributor will accept the aftermarket Pertronix or
&gt; Compu-Fire Electronic Igntion Systems.
&gt;
&gt; If you have a Air Cooled California 83 or a Water Cooled 83.5, then your
&gt; distributor should already be Hall Electronic Ignition.  The SVDA will not
&gt; work in it's place because of how the Ignition System is used to provide
the
&gt; Tachometer signal to the Fuel Injection ECU (Brain).  You must use an
&gt; original distributor and it's components for this set up.  That's not to
say
&gt; that with a bit of electronics knowledge and savvy that it could probably
be
&gt; modified to be used with the points style distributor, but to me it's more
&gt; work than it's worth.
&gt;
&gt; Final note - if you do have the Factory Electronic Ignition, I don't
&gt; believe the mounting plate(s) on these distributors accept either the
&gt; Petronix or Compu-Fire as a drop-in replacement.  However, I believe the
&gt; Crane Ignition System offers such a beast (at least they did years ago when
&gt; it was known Allison before they were bought out by Crane Cams).  But the
&gt; Crane System costs about as much as the factory replacement Hall Unit Kit
&gt; for these distributors.
&gt;
&gt; See my webpages for further distributor info:

&gt; &gt; Hello!
&gt; &gt; I know very little about this... are there different distributors for
&gt; &gt; electronic ignition and for points?
&gt; &gt; Specifically, will the SVDA distributor at CB Performance (
&gt; &gt; http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=1348) work with a
&gt; &gt; 1983
&gt; &gt; Vanagon?
&gt; &gt; Bus Depot lists the same distributor for a range of buses ranging from
&gt; &gt; 1950
&gt; &gt; to 1983... but the shop my bus is at tells me that the distributor I
&gt; &gt; bought
&gt; &gt; is for points, not electronic ignition.
&gt; &gt; Would somebody mind educating me a bit?
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; Mike.
