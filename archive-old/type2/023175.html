Subject: Engine Installation Conversion Tin
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Here are some pictures of the conversion tin I picked up from Brian, a list 
member in Holland, the other week.

It will be used by my cousin to properly install his 1600 DP into his 1972 bus.

Brian really went all out to make my cousin quite happy........... Nice 
parts, some new parts, powder coating the bar, tin, etc.
We were quite overwhelmed with the hard work put forth by Brian to make 
sure all was proper and right in our swap deal.
Wow, with that Dutch precise attention to details, those Dutch should never 
ever have to worry about the dams leaking !!

Looking to swap beers with you in a few years, Brian. :-)

Here is how I packaged the stuff, after I &quot;unpackaged&quot; Brian's really good 
box in Germany so I could get the parts into our small tour car for being 
drug across the Alps and all across Northern Italy.

This is what I gave to the check-in counter as luggage. :-)
