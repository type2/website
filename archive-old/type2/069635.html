Subject: Top for a Solex 30 pict 3 and/or advice in PDX?

Greetings all--

I cleverly stripped the threads on the post that holds the fast idle cam. 
[No need to razz me; Pat Walsh already did--thanks, Pat.] The nut--the one
on the carb--is now permanently on, but the cam isn't riding right and I
can't repair/adjust it any further till I can get the nut off. 

I don't really want to buy a whole carb just to get the top assembly; any
ideas about where I can get the top, in this neck of the woods?  Or, if 
there's something I'm overlooking, any other advice? 

TIA
Bill
70 bus
Portland OR

p.s. Since I've got the Portlanders' attention: Whoever has the orange bus
with PUMPKIN licence plates, I just wanted to say I've admired it down on
23rd more than once.  And are the Portland bus people organized in any
way?
