Hi,

You are right the transmission shouldn't whine, and it 
could indicate wear. I would change the tranmission oil 
and see if that makes any difference (remember to 
remove the filler plug before the drain plug - if its 
empty and the filler plug won't come out...)

Routine maintenance may fix the surging.
As the bus is new to you it would be a good idea (if you 
havn't done so already) to replace points, condenser, 
spark plugs, leads, rotor arm, air filter, engine oil, 
petrol filter, then you know where you stand on all these
common expendables.
Of course you would combine the above with tappet 
adjustment and a tune up.
That will be a major slice of a weekend to do all that, 
but it will give you a known datum from which to work 
and will eliminate the causes of many common faults.

Good luck

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I've been lurking here for some time gathering 
knowledge and I've finally bought myself a vehicle.
&gt;I bought a '72 bus in pretty nice shape.
&gt;
&gt;I am hearing something that doesn't sound right to 
me though. When I accelerate, I hear a whining 
&gt;sound. Same sound as when I reverse in my other car. 
I don't remember that sound when I drove a 
&gt;bus a few years ago. Is this a sign of tranny trouble?
&gt;
&gt;Also, the van seems to surge a bit when I'm driving at 
a steady speed. It kind of tries to jump 
&gt;forward even though I haven't moved my foot on the 
pedal. Any ideas where to start looking?
&gt;
&gt;I'm new to this stuff, and just need a bit of help 
getting pointed in the right direction.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
&gt;
