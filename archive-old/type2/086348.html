Subject: re:cylinder spacers

sorry about the last post, hit the send button on
accident, the spacers are dependant on where you want
your compression set and are figured by a calculation
therefore you can have different numbers/thicknesses
from one to another on the same engine.  you need a
&quot;cc kit&quot; from gene berg or kymco to figure this out.

Subject: 1600DP question

Ok.. a question for the 1600 guru's... on  the bottom 
of the cylinders there
are some &quot;rings&quot; used for.... we are assuming shimming

the cylinders to the
correct height.
How many rings should there be... we have three but, 
thinking there should
be four.  And, let me know if we are correct in 
assuming the usage of these
rings...
Thanks
Gail Doles
