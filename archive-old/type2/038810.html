&gt; I'm sure that this subject has been addressed.  If there are archive strings 
&gt; could someone please tell me where to look, but...
&gt; 
&gt; I want to ensure that the aux battery system is functioning before I do some 
&gt; camping this summer.  When I took my rig to my local VW shop we determined 
&gt; that the aux battery is dead and that the charging system is not working.  
&gt; What are common problems to look for?

Easy check is to check the voltage at the aux battery with the engine
running.  If it is the same as the voltage at the starting battery, then
the aux battery is bad.

If the voltage is still zero, then you have a bad relay or the wiring is
bad.  Work backwards to figure out which.
