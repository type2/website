Kevin Cleary sends:

&gt; I decided to restore my 79 back to it's original condition and I figured
&gt; that the best way to start was with a new 2.0l engine. I purchased the
&gt; engine from the bus depot and consequently AVP who supplies them with
&gt; the engines. My installation went without a hitch and everything bolted
&gt; right up. My problem is that when the distributor is set where it's
&gt; supposed to be the engine won't start. only when the distributor is
&gt; turned way out ( like 180) will it start. My mechanic seems to think
&gt; that the crankshaft wasn't aligned properly and that is the problem. I
&gt; have left messages at AVP's # and never got a return call, I actually
&gt; spoke to a woman who said that I have to speak with Leonard and that he
&gt; wasn't in and would call back...no call. Anyway I was wondering if any
&gt; list members might be able to tell me what the problem is and how to
&gt; correct this?? Is this a common thing?? Does AVP do quality work and
&gt; this is an exception?? Is the mechanic wrong and there could be
&gt; something else?? Obviously with the distributor out almost 180 it is
&gt; impossible to set the timing so the engine will eventually have
&gt; problems?? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance

This is common. The distributor drive pinion was installed 180 degrees out
of phase (&quot;backwards&quot;). Find a distributor drive pinion puller, pull out the
pinion (if you remove your distributor and look down the hole it was in,
you'll see a piece of metal with a big slot in the top and a spring sticking
out of it. That's the pinion.), turn it around and put it back in.

Try timing it first, though; you may be able to get it set right, and if you
do, leave it alone.
