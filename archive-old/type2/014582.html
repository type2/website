Here's a couple of hints from one who lived with his ' 78 Westy in Colorado 
at 9000ft.+ during the winters ( This translates to &quot;Cold As S#%T&quot;). 1) 
Sounds weird, but chrome plated valve covers will raise your temps about 
10-12 degrees F at air temps of 20 or below. 2) I installed a push/pull choke 
cable to my T-stat flapper control lever ( disconected the T-stat cable) and 
ran it to my dash. In conjuction with an oil temp gauge, I was able to 
maintain an operating temp of 190-210 F in short order. You just had to keep 
a sharp eye on the temp gauge and adjust as needed. 3) Ran a mix of 3qt.'s 
fully Synthetic 10-30 plus  0.7 qt.'s Marvel Mystery Oil. Everything worked 
very well. Still running the original eng., at 115,000miles, although I'm now 
in warmer climes.
Good Luck,
Robb
