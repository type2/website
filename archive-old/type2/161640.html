Subject: RE: [T2] Re: 1972 Bus, work in progress

My deluxe has factory/dealer AC and it looks just like this one on the 72.
I'll try to take pics of my whole setup before I pull it all - it's missing
whatever part lives in the engine compartment and I want to loose all that
dead weight.

I'm wondering if my stuff could be of use for anyone - like for this 72 or
anyone that wants to try and get AC working - I'm running out of room for VW
junk - I mean stuff.

-Daniel


&gt; The A/C install looks really nice! What did you do in the engine
compartment&gt; in terms of A/C compressors? Did you install another pulley on
the fan?&gt; &gt; &gt; Here are some of my '72 Bus pictures.  More to follow.
