&gt; Dear List,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm hoping that someone will have a good fix to my NLA part for my '71 4
&gt; speed tranny.  It is the &quot;dust cover inner shift lever&quot; or the boot that
&gt; covers the end of the nosecone.  The part number is 211 301 289A and no one
&gt; has it that I know of.  Tried Weddle, Ron, Old Volks, Wolfsburg West and
&gt; none had it.  A guy at Wolfsburg suggested going to a 4x4 store that
&gt; carries shock boots and finding one of them that would fit.  Don't have any
&gt; around and hate hot pink ;)  Anyone tried anything else that would work?
&gt; Got to keep the dirt and dust out of my tranny and off of my shiny new
&gt; hockey stick :)

I haven't tried this yet, but years ago we used to make fork boots for
dirt bikes out of upholstery fabric and velcro.  You essentially take a
rectangle of upholstery fabric and sew velcro on opposite edges so that it
can be fastened around the shaft without disassembely.  Then you secure
the ends with plastic Zip-ties.
