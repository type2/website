Subject: Re: [T2] sliding door woes

My previous suggestions were of no value
in solving your problem. I had pictured
the rear lock mechanism incorrectly.
I took a look at a door today, and did
discover the door can be removed if in
fact the mechanism is kaput.

A &quot;ball&quot; allen wrench will remove the rear catch.
This would have allowed the door to open.
Then the rear latch hardware could be removed.

The front catch is easily accessed from inside
with a wrench. This would resolve an issue
with the front latch hardware.

&gt; Hi Dave
&gt; Thanks for the response.
&gt; I just want to make sure I have this right.
&gt; The door is shut and unable to open. It's securly latched
&gt; at the rear of the sliding door allowing no outward motion of the
&gt; door.
&gt; 
&gt; If I am to understand what you are saying I need to remove the
&gt; rear sliding runner cover exposing the hinge and stuff. As well
&gt; as removing the front channel gear.. this will allow the rear
&gt; latch to unlatch? How?
