Subject: Anti-Seize  

The 'anti seize on spark plug threads' thread has been over for a while, but
I have a new (to me) wrinkle to add. I was at my bearing supplier today and
saw &quot;Nuclear Grade&quot; Anti Seize which claimed to be good for temps up to
2600F. Now I haven't installed my Flux Capacitor yet but when I do, I'm
wondering if this stuff will hold up to the temps generated by 1.21
gigawatts of electricity.

Seriously, has anyone tried this type of anti seize on spark plugs? Does it
work or not?

Just wondering....
Dave
