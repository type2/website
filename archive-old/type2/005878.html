PLF products are of excellent quality, beyond doubt, but there are
alternatives...

For &quot;hardware&quot; you can go to any marine or RV store and get RECMAR
SLIDE-RITE curtain track kits in a variety of colors and lengths.  The
tracks and sliders are essentially identical to those used by Westfalia in
many VW campers.  Because they're nylon/plastic they won't rust or corrode,
and the price is almost ridiculously low.

Curtains are not difficult to make.  One single male member of WetWesties
[Pacific Northwest VW Camping club] fabricated a complete replacement set
for his Westy without sewing a single stitch in the process.  He used heat
set [iron on] bonding tape, etc., and the results are fantastic.  Until he
described and demonstrated his procedure none of the female members would
believe he'd done the job himself sans sewing machine.

This gentleman spends _months_ at a time traveling in his Westy, and the
curtains have held up just fine.  And doing it yourself provides the
opportunity to choose the color, pattern, type, and weight of fabric that
suits your wants/needs.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Try &quot;Peace Love &amp; Freedom&quot;.  You get a choice in fabrics &quot;over 100
colors and stripes&quot;, $160.00 for a full set.  They have nice stuff.  Good
tents too.  &lt;&lt;
