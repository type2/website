&lt;&lt; The dizzy will have it's no's stamped on it's side, usually most
inconveniently on the side you can't see. :-) It will be a long no. and
depending on whether it's Bosch or VW will be stamped with it's maker.

A flashlight and a small/compact mirror will suffice and not require
removing the dizzy...(compact mirrors are better since they usually
enlarge a bit and come in a case... 8-)
