&gt;  &gt;Are new 2L heads available?
&gt;
&gt; No.

Actually this is not quite correct.  You _can_ buy new heads from AMC Spain.
Their reputation is that they have the same tendancy to drop valve seats (or
worse, depending on who you ask; see the archives) as the original VW ones
did.  Which makes the AVP heads (which I sell) and Marc Stephens heads an
improvement over them (for less money), since they have a newer design that
minimizes this problem.
