Subject: vanagon seats into 77 Westie??

My 77 Westy seats are very very tired, the drivers side frame along the springs being cracked. No padding left, plaid pretty much threadbare. My buddy Phil's 81 Westy has gorgeous seats. Will my seats just unbolt and can I bolt more modern Vanagon seats into it? Is it as easy as that?
Thanks,
Courtney
