Subject: Removing washer nozzles
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Listees,

Thought I'd share a trick I figured out the other day
while prepping my 71
for paint. The washer nozzles needed to be removed so
I could fix some minor
pitting. Piece of cake I said. 10 minute job :)  Turns
out they're held on
by a single cross-shaped spring clip which is barely
accessible with
fingers - forget pliers.
After a lot of head scratching, I hit on the idea of
using a deep socket to
squeeze the clip; I think it was a 3/8. With the
windshield already out, I
reached under the dash with the socket and jammed it
onto the clip,
compressing the sides. With the other hand I reached
out to the nozzle and
wiggled it off in a second or 2. If the windshield had
been in, I would have
enlisted a friend to pull the nozzle off while I
worked from the inside.
Solving problem/head scratching/cursing= 1 hour.
Actually taking nozzles
off=5 min.
Hope this saves someone some frustration.

Tom
