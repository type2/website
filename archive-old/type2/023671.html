&lt;&lt; the spring loaded contacts don't push the bulb into the bayonet. i 
don't really see how these can be repaired, since it's a small 
internal part. i'm thinking at this point that maybe i just need to 
buy new tail light assemblies, which should have firmer sockets.

before i order this, does anyone know of a trick to retension the 
springs? i couldn't see how this thing would come apart to do it 
myself.

If you buy new assemblies, try and find the real Hella parts.  I bought some 
new units that I think were made in China and they are real crap.  I used a 
greenlee punch and enlarged the holes the sockets fit into.  I bought some 
USA made generic sockets at Napa and pop riveted them to the plate.  I am no 
longer able to put the back cover on, but my tail lights are now brighter 
than ever, and the bulbs fit in great.
