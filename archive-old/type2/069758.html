&gt;gears just fine, including 2nd.  The problem arises during downshifting.  If
&gt;I try to drop down to 2nd to go around a corner or just to slow down I get
&gt;this horrible &lt;gnaaakkkkkckssckhh&gt; sound and it won't go.  If I really,
&gt;really, insist it will go but it'll pop right out.  Does this sound like new
&gt;tranny time or just a long-needed adjustment?
