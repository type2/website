In an engine, burning fuel, whether it's gas, propane or diesel, is know 
as combustion, as you know. Gasoline is a highly combustable fuel, when 
mixed with air. For this reason, all the parts must function properly, 
in order to extract a reasonable amount of power from the fuel burned.

For a moment, picture what's happening on the inside of a proper engine. 
A proper fuel/air mixture has been drawn into the combustion chamber, 
both valves are closed, and the piston is moving upward, compressing the 
mixture. The fuel mix is ignited by the spark plug, and combustion 
spreads outward in an arc shape. As it burns, the volume increases 
rapidly, and it exerts pressure on the cylinder, and tries to push the 
piston downward. In this example, the piston is past top-dead-center, 
and the pressure is relieved as the piston is forced downward. This 
is sort of like swinging someone. If you push just as they begin 
their forward swing, they are propelled higher.

The spark is often fired before-top-dead-center to allow the combusted 
gases time to expand, so they reach the piston at the right time. This 
is why timing can continue to advance as engine speed increases... the 
pistons are moving much faster, but the gas burns at relatively the same 
speed. (Many factors can change the combustion speed, but this is 
generally so.)

An engine is a ballet of moving parts, and each must function in concert 
with one another. Maximum efficientcy (performance) and long engine life 
reach a trade off point. You can get a bit more power by pushing one 
design feature, but shorter engine life may be the result, but with all 
things working properly, a reasonable compromise can be reached.

Ok, let's say you bump the timing a bit. Immediately you get lots of 
&quot;free&quot; power, and an increase in fuel efficientcy, so you advance it a 
bit too far. Under a load (moderate throttle), especially at lower RPM, 
you notice a &quot;ping&quot; in the engine. What's happening here is that the 
fuel is expanding outward, but the piston cannot travel downward. Since 
the piston is not on its downward 'swing', the burning gas 'slaps' the 
piston severly. Again, this would be like pushing that swing, except you 
slam the person in the back while they are still travelling towards you. 
In an engine, this constant pounding on the pistons can cause the 
combustion chamber to &quot;ring&quot;, and can cause hot spots to develope as 
this area is now subjected to extreme temperatures for a longer period 
of time. The &quot;ringing&quot; and extreme heat can cause the metal to fatigue 
and flake from its surfaces, and can cause the valves to overheat, 
especially the exhaust valve (the intake valve is cooled by the intake 
of the next load of fuel, but the exhaust gets no such help).

Other conditions can cause similar circumstances, of course. Anything 
that makes the fuel burn quicker, can increase HP, but can lead to this 
same sort of damage, unless controlled. Fuel additives (ie nitro, etc), 
an increase in the fuel mix's temperature, or increased compression can 
all change the burning characteristics. 

Have you ever taken a hot running car up a hill and notice that it is 
now pinging, even though it normally runs fine? This is caused by the 
fuel mix temperature being increased. Hot fuel ignites more quickly. 
High performance cars use a &quot;cool can&quot;, where they precool the fuel to 
allow it to burn slower... and develope stable power.

When fuel is compressed, the atoms are shoved closer together. This 
allows greater efficientcy (this is how a diesel vehicle can get diesel 
fuel to ignite). With the atoms closer together, there is a greater 
chance the petro and oxygen atoms will combine, approaching as closely 
as possible to 100%. Unfortunately, if compression it too high, the 
mixture wants to explode, so other ingredients can be added to petroleum 
to make it burn slower (ie higher octane). One method of increasing 
compression is to mill the heads... another is to allow carbon to build 
in the combustion chambers. With heavy carbon build up, you get another 
problem... hot spots. These are basically glowing embers. When the fuel 
is compressed, these can ignite the mix. Now you get the the same 
results as if the timing was advanced, except the fuel mix can be 
ignited from multiple spots... and it's out of control. This can also 
cause &quot;run-after&quot; or &quot;dieseling&quot; of the engine when it's turned off.

Too lean a fuel mix causes its own problems, and I've never been 
completely satisfied with the answers I've read on this one. It seems 
that a proper fuel mix tends to be self-dampening. As the molecules of 
oxygen and petrol combine during the combustion process, they tend to 
get in each other's way... so the process is somewhat retarted. In an 
overly lean mix, there is an abundance of oxygen, so the process if more 
of an explosion. There's fewer hydro-carbon molecules, but they combine 
with oxygen at a greatly increased speed... and detonation occurs.

Sorry for the long winded discussion, and I'm sure I've 
overlooked/mistated a few things, but the factors concerned are the 
subject of books... and a lifetime study for those who design and/or 
race these things. In building and tuning engines, I sometimes have to 
reflect back on the raging inferno the engine is faced with. At cruising 
speeds, an engine might be turning 3000 RPM... which means each cylinder 
must be supplied with the proper fuel/air/spark mix, at the precise 
moment, 25 times every second, 3000 times a minute, 180000 times every 
hour!
