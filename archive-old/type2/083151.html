Subject: RE: [T2] Oil substance leaking at rapid rate ---UPDATE

Surely, you jest! (No I don't, and I know... your name is &quot;Troy&quot; :-) We'd
love to!

The problem as I see it is that there are three possible outcomes, only
one of which would count as a &quot;win.&quot;  In that area there are three places
from which oil can come:

the forward crank seal;
the cam plug;
a crack in the case.

If the leak is from the forward crank seal, no sweat. Pull engine,
measure end play, remove flywheel, replace seal, reset end play, button
it up.

If it is the cam plug, well, we could RTV it as a temporary fix, but to
really fix it, you have to split the case.  I suppose with as many people
as we would have there, a complete overhaul could be done if we could find
a machine shop with saturday hours.  We'd have to split into teams and
could do it as a race, but I have no doubt it could be done :-)

If it's the case, well, it's the case.  You need a new one.  Same
scenario as the cam plug, but we don't ned the machine shop, just a new
case.

It is very probable that your problem is the bad crank seal, but you
should understand that the other two possibilities exist.

&gt; This is truly amazing.  I would love to do this, but almost feel bad
&gt; about asking.  Please let me know if there is a way that this could be
&gt; done.  I really have no other option.  I would be willing to spend any
&gt; extra money I have to get tools if needed (Granted that's not much $)
&gt; Also, what seal is it that I would need to get?  Should I get other
&gt; seals to replace while I am at it?  I can't thank the list enough and
&gt; truly appreciate what you have all done.

Whee!!!  this is gonna be fun! :-)

As I see it, other than tools that will probably be on hand in droves (my
3/4&quot; socket sets lives in my bus), you will need a new seal, some shims,
and a new clutch disc.  I don't usually travel with a flywheel lock for T1
engines, but I can't imagine that 10-20 will not be on hand in various
tool boxes.  I also don't *usually* travel with the dial indicator, but I
will try to remember to drop it in the bus.
