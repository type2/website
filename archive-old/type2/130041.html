Subject: Re: Brake resevoir to mastercylinder hose/tube '71

&gt;From: JHMEARSRN_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;   I need a replacement hose/tube that runs from the brake fluid resevoir
&gt;behind the drivers seat down to the master cylinder. I tried to find info 
&gt;in the
&gt;archives but
&gt;could only find reference to the black seals/grommets that fit between the
&gt;hose and the resevoir and master cylinder.  Does anyone know a source for 
&gt;this
&gt;tube/hose
&gt;material?  I tried using some tubing from Pep Boys but can't get a good seal,
&gt;the
&gt;fluid all leaks out in one day.  Any info or tips greatly
&gt;appreciated......John

This is a special tube that has a special size and material. The 
replacement tube is a blue tubing with a cloth cover. I don't know who 
sells it now. I would always call Ron at the Bus Depot first and he can 
prob. get it.

That said, the previous stuff on mine was clear plastic tubing that looked 
like large aquarium tubing. It was on there for at least 10 years. It was 
quite a bit too small but someone, prob. my dad, had heated it and 
stretched it over the fittings to get a tight fit. When I took it off it 
was hard as nails but didn't leak.

Good luck! Use the right stuff if you can get it. But if you can't, I am 
sure you can rig something.
