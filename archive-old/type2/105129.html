Subject: Re: [T2] Bugpack valve covers

Don't listen to the naysayers. Just apply a little 21st. Century Technology. 
Instead of using a cork gasket, run down to your local FLAPS and grab a can 
of Permatex &quot;cheese whiz&quot; EPDM gasket maker. GM, Ford, D/C, BMW, AUDI and a 
host of Jap auto makers use the stuff as OE to seal their valve covers. Comes 
in a can that looks just like, you guessed it, Cheese Whiz. Costs about 13.00 
bucks. Squirt it on, slap the covers on, and drive off. No cure time 
required. Will not Leak. Forms a &quot;C&quot; channel seal. And before I get flamed, 
I've been running an ancient set of EMPI aluminum covers on my '78 2.0L FI 
for over 60k miles, with, as I said, no leaks. The '79 and '81 have newer 
aluminum covers made by Truehoffer, have racked up close to 100k between 
them, and don't leak. Can't swallow that, well then by all means, come out to 
EveryBus and have a look for yourself.
