Subject: Re: [T2] Re. Heat and Noise in a VW Bus.

&gt;I have decided to not
&gt; use cool patch or anything designed to stick permanently to the floor,
walls
&gt; or interior of the bus.  This is mostly because I imagine that someday I
may
&gt; very well end up welding again in that area or somewhere else in the van.

I have the same concerns, as well as wanting to do everything on the cheap.
I bought scraps of closed cell foam from the local foam shop and put them on
the cab roof with 3M spray adhesive.  They also sold me a 1&quot; 4x8 sheet of
styrofoam for less than $20, and I am in the process of fitting that into
the side walls.  Probably put more closed cell foam scraps under the rear
seat.

Regards, Grant
