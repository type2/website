fix the oil leaks, I have run nothing but sythetics (except during
breakin) for 25 years or more, since mobil 1 was introduced.  I and others
know that it is not that hard to keep the oil in.

my type 4 rarely uses even a quart between oil changes, I  have good luck
with 6,000 mile intervals, shown by teardown of engines.

can't beat it if you ask me.

&gt;kind of expensive.  It seems that mixing the 2 different kinds of oil

problems.

keep the oil in, it gets all the advatages of synthetic, and none of the
disadvantages of the dino

BTW the first vehicle I ran synthetic in was my 71 van, bought new from VW
got well over 100k on it 
YMMV
