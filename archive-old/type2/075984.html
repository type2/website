Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine

That procedure sounds great! ...... Do you have a motorcycle to break in?
I'd stick with the 20 minutes at 2000 rpm on the Air Cooled VW engine.
It might be entirely different on Water Cooled VWs.
You 'll get some differing opinions from the list so just pick a
procedure that you can live with.

&gt; method...
