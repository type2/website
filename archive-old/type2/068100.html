Subject: 34 PICT3 sources and prices?

        Stan,
        8.5% [CO, right?] sounds like its running too rich or burning
really lousey. What color are the spark plug tips? Spark itself? 
Did you do plugs/points/condenser/cap/rotor? Have you a buddy or
other vehicle you can borrow a coil &amp; distributor from?

If a carb can't be adjusted then either the needle valve doesn't do 
anything because its all crudy inside (A problem I sorta understand) 
or something is wrong with your jets blah blah blah, which is not an 
area I'm confident in. OR the problem isn't the carb.

        I've got a new (Brazilian) 34 PICT 3 on my '70. For your
reference, I got 7.39% CO at idle out of the box, and the guy who
does the smog-checks just adjusted it down to 4.82% using the mixture
control (needle valve), gratis :), and sent me home happy. 
        My 2500 rpm CO was 0.17%. If 8.5% CO is your 2500rpm read, I'd
check-out the spark and timing systems before laying out $$$ for a 
new carb. If you had big CO AND big HC numbers, then its running
rich and thats a carb problem. 
        At idle I was getting 351ppm HC with the high CO, and that
went down to 195ppm HC when the mix was leaned out for CO.

        If you do go for a new carb, its $199 in the RMMW catalog- sounds 
like the repair shop _at_169+ tax is a good deal. Will it guaranteed fix 
your bus? No.

        Bill
