Subject: Re: [T2] the VW problem

&gt; Before we got our busses, we bought a jetta, thinking that until we found the aircooled vehicles we wanted, we could at least drive a VW.
&gt; That was before I learned much about the current state of affairs at the company.

I found it out about VWOA before I purchased the Passat I was looking at
for my wife, instead bought a S*turn
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be letting VW know that once I unload their jetta, I won't be purchasing another new one.

I like my bus but have removed the VW emblem from the nose.
&gt; 
&gt; My main point is that list griping feels good, but doesn't get our voices heard.

I would prefer the name of the CEO and address of the headquarters in
Germany...send the message to the top, not some flunky in New York or IN
