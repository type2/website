Subject: Re: Headliner Removal ????

Yucel,

Have fun on this one.  To remove the headliner properly and entirely,
you will need to remove the windows.  Take pictures before you start to
remember how it goes back.

I myself have removed the headliner from mine and I am saving to have
this one done by someone else.  It is almost impossible to remove all
the old headliner, let alone without ripping 26 year old material. It is
glued in several places.

I wish you luck

Peace Brother,
Snoopy


&gt; 
&gt;     I was going to attempt a headliner removal and transplant this weekend.
&gt; I have never tried this before.  I have questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this even possible?
