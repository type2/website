Subject: More M-Code Confusion

I was working on the M-Code Page on the NEATO web page today at 
lunch (Tom Forhan had pointed out a glitch last week) and decided 
to update a few items.

I added a table for an example of the later version of the VIN plate, 
but can't remember offhand when the change in styles took place.  I 
seem to remember 1964, but it could have been 1963.  Anyone know for 
sure?  (I have a '62 &amp; '64 in my yard right now, but the '63 is in 
'storage')

I want to add the addtional Westy SO-42 designations as to which 
version of the interior is installed.  I know there are at least 
3 different numbers:

A42
B42
C42

What I need to know from as many late Split Westy owners as possible 
is which number you have, hardtop or poptop, and whether yours is a 
bench seat or walk-through.

I also looked at my 1960 Double Door Standard VIN plate which reads:

04 01 0
372 175 209
UP 221 GRGREEN 554195

which means produced 04 January, 1960

372 which I am assuming is an export country package
175 which is bumper overriders
209 which I am assuming is 9-seat Double Cargo Door (211 is 9-seat 
    double sliding door)

UP is the delivery port
221 is Standard LHD
GRGREEN is Seagull Grey over Mango Green

The guy I bought it from said the guy he bought it from said it was 
from Germany, Norway, or Sweden.  I believed him at the time, because 
it came with Euro blade bumpers and kh speedometer.  But after seeing 
that it originally came with overriders and the UP delivery port is a 
United States port I believe.

Are there any other Double Door passenger van model owners out there 
who can verify the 209 number?

Can anyone confirm what the 372 export model designation is?

I will try to upload the changes to the NEATO web page this evening 
and as always, you can reach the site at:

despite the address VW Trends published (although I can see how 
they could be distracted and mis-type, what with all the bikini 
babes dancing around...)   :)
