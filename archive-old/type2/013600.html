Is there an

&gt;or not? 

Mike:

The most common way to do this is to buy a Weber Progressive carb kit.  It comes with a center section that attaches between the stock end sections.  Also available, if you don't like progressive carbs, are the 2-barrel Weber kits that have one barrel feeding each side of the engine.  Again, these kits have a center section that goes between the stock end sections.
