Subject: Re: Squeak, squeak cure?

I have serious squeaking in my front end on every bump, lean, etc.
Interestingly, I don't have an anti-sway bar, or, more accurately
both of the arms on mine are broken (rusted) off at the bushing on
the A-frame (?).  I just got a new bar with intact arms from
Ken Wyatt's stripped parts beast (thanks Ken!).

I have tried spraying all kinds of stuff everywhere on the
suspension I can, and nothing has made a bit off difference.
Anyone solved this one before?

&gt;Howdy -
&gt;I have been noticing a distinct *squeak* sound from the front end of my 
&gt;'80 lately. The sound is definitely related to vertical movement of 
&gt;the front end.  I can wiggle in my seat at a stop and hear it. While
&gt;doing a front disc replacement yesterday I was able to locate a
&gt;culprit.  The anti-sway bar goes through a rubber bushing as do
&gt;other bits and pieces of the suspension system.  I can see black 
&gt;residue (rubber?) next to where the metal bar goes through the rubber 
&gt;on a small portion of the bushing.
