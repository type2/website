Brett,

if I remember correctly, there's a small vacuum hose going from the rear
left corner of the air intake distributor up to a small T, with one end of
the T going the decel valve (the gold disk) and the other to the fuel
pressure regulator.  The fuel pressure regulator is also on the firewall,
to the right; follow the fuel rail and you'll find it. 

I'll double check tonight.
