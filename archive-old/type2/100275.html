Subject: Re: Using 2000 FI stuff in a 1975 1800cc engine

I &quot;second&quot; Dr. Tim on this one, Mike. I have an all-stock 1975 w/1800 cc 
engine and have never had a problem with any of the FI gear. Why mix stuff 
from 76-79 on a 75 engine when there are so many different possible 
pitfalls: displacement, egr control (electrical vs. mechanical), temp sensor 
location, operation of the throttle position switch, 6-pin vs 7-pin plug...? 
I think you would be asking for trouble. Also, the 'mid-year correction' 
occured during the 1976 model year (Feb. to be exact), so the '75's are all 
self-consistent.
Best of luck!
Roland
