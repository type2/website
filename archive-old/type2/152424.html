Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating / timing

Hi Will,
I took your advice and tried to disconnect the vacuum retard, plug the
port on manifold and time dynamically at 5deg BTDC (and 8 BTDC on the
next ride). Warmed the beast and went for my test-hill-drive. I was
not impressed, neither by the power, nor by the &quot;flat spot&quot;.

The dizzy is a stock for a 71 bus (205Q) . According to Oldvolkshome
it has minus 11-13 degrees of vacuum retard and plus 2-5 degrees of
vacuum advance. The total range of advance/retard is about 13 to 18
degrees.

I think that by not using the vacuum retard the range of the
advance/retard is reduced from about 13-18 degrees to about 2-5
degrees. I verified the very little range of the vacuum advance by
sucking in the vacuum advance hose, with the vacuum retard port open
in the air. It barely gave 2 degrees of extra advance off idle.

That mod makes the stock dizzy behave more like a 009 than a real
vacuum advance dizzy. I come from 009 land and want to avoid returning
there.

John C. Wondering what is the vacuum advance range of the ACN SVDA ?

&gt; I advise to ditch the retard line and plug your manifold port. you don't
&gt; need retard. you can leave the retard port open on the dist.  Even Karl
&gt; who is big on emissions equipment in CA recommended this for my T1
&gt; application.  use the advance only. I assume you are using a 205 dist.
&gt; of some sort.   I set mine at 5-7 BTDC (205 E w/retard disconnected) 900
&gt; rpm idle with strobe.  if it still pings then use higher octane gas.  if
&gt; you don't want to pay for higher octane gas, back it off till it stops
&gt; pinging under load.
