&gt;I try to start the engine but it doesn't
&gt;want to start, like it's got no fuel, it begines to start and second later
&gt;*clunck...clunk...clunck....*   the engine dies slowly (not a clunck your
&gt;engines dead)  Try again, engine seems seized.&gt;

&gt;I know this is going to be something bad...so I have it towed back, and I'm
&gt;in the process of droping the engine....my questions is...does anyone have
&gt;an idea where I should begin to look for the problem?

Patrick,

Many simple things will tell you more.  Use a 13mm socket at the fan hub to
confirm whether the engine is indeed seized up,  if it is then continue with
the removal.  Check the compression to see if you have catastrophic damage
to a head or piston and cylinders.  You need the engine in the bus to check
compression so this would be a wise idea before you drop the engine.  If
compression is shot in one or more cylinders then continue with removal.
Drain the oil and look for shavings, if excessive then continue with
removal.  I'm sure there are several other things to look at before you drop
the engine, but these are the most obvious to me.  Good luck.
