Subject: Dormobiles?

I'm looking at pictures of a '70 Dormobile that's for sale that appears in 
really great shape and interests me. All I know about them is the little 
amount I found in the archives. It says that they were made in the UK, so 
they aren't Westy's obviously. Who can tell me a little about them. Are they 
rare?
