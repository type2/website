&lt;&lt; &quot;914&quot;... for some reason the Posche-people just don't seem to be
constitutionally capable of admitting the existence of a car with the
Porsche badge containting actual Volkswagen parts.
 &gt;&gt;

As far as I know, the 914 only carried the Porsche badge
exclusively in the USA...In Europe, it was VW/Porsche...
It's a marketing thing, too. Both Porsche and VW could
produce &quot;cheaper&quot; (cost-wise) cars but in Porsche's case,
that might dilute the brand name's value...There are other
products with the Porsche logo on them and the cost has
little to do with the product, but more to do with the cachet
that the high price implies...VW, on the other hand, is try-
ing to tread a fine line...It's logo implies value for money
(what the original Beetle developed) but not a cheap car...
(i.e. a Yugo or a Kia) and prices accordingly. That VW also
paid tons of Euros for the Bentley name is another attempt
to upgrade it's image...And then there's the Phaeton...And
the is-it-on-the-road-yet Bugatti...
As for SUV's...Well, there's just too much demand for them
for any manufacturer to not have one on the showroom floor
just in case a VW or Porsche customer asks for one...Just ask
GM, who put a SAAB badge on the Subaru for just that reason...:-(
