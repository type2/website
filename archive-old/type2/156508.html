Subject: Re: [T2] rebuilt 2.0 oil leak

hey phil could this also be my problem..?  i thought it might be my flywheel seal ..
   
  this seems to be the only leak i got (hope i dont jinx myself) .. i got a half dollar size or more sometimes of oil right under where the tranny and engine mate..
  i thought i  used the good flywheel seal though???  didnt start leaking till about 3k miles ago and now its getting biggfer and bigger whcih means i will soon have to pull my engine again to change it... can aleak right here also cause problems with the clutch disk etc...or flywheel in some way.. with oil being everywhere..

  Gallery plugs behind the flywheel in the case, could
