I am currently looking at a 1975 devon coversion camper but being new to
this i'm not quite sure what its worth.
    Mechanically its sound, the camping interior would have to be redone,
there are two small rusty holes either side of the front indicators, the
doorsteps in both front doors are bubbling with rust coming through, the
drivers side rear corner is quite bad but would probably to with patching
and not a whole new rear corner, the drivers side sill has been redone,
underneath it is fine, the paintwork is rough with a few other small ares
needing a rub done, the whole van would need a respray.
    The asking price is £1500 ( thats irish punts ) but i think this is to
much, i would appreciate any advice particularly from any one in Ireland or
England.
Thanks,
Brian M
