Well, 5:30 friday evening, just as I'm getting off work, heading home to
shower, pickup my friend, and leave, I call to make sure the friend is
going to be ready to go.

&quot;I thought about it last night...I cant afford to take off work&quot;

I offer to pay him, he comes up with another lame excuse.  He's had a
friggin week to think about this. *sigh*

Get home, call other folk.  No one can/will go.

So. Nogo.
