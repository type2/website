Subject: Cleanser for Int. Poptop?
Message-Id: &lt;l03110700b329759594aa_at_[207.194.197.228]&gt;

Can anyone recommend what to use for cleaning the inside (i.e. &quot;ceiling&quot;)
of a pop-top?  I just opened it up for the first time in months, and I have
some small mold growth on the soft material -- I would try bleach, but
don't know if that might damage the fuzzy stuff.

I'm going to the archives now, but I need to know right away, so in case
you have a quick answer..... TIA.
