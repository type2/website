Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming from dipstick ????

yeah i usually get phil to watch the tester and we pull the  dizzy cap and all the plugs but i wasnt sure if it would hold its compresion so i could do it by myself...
 
phil may come up and give me a hand though dont know right now...?
it cost him about 12 bucks in gas every trip he makes here and he has made more than 12 for sure....
right now my funds are really bad low... work has not only slowed down but stopped dead for me... this is a bad time for the engine to act like this....
i was in the process of finding new work/career when all the oil decided to start throwing up;...
thanks jason..
peace and love
chris

OK that was a bit vaugue. You also need to disable the ignition
(spark). I'm really not sure what the best way to is, but you can
remove the power to the coil/ remove the rotor button/ remove the
primary coil wire and ground. any of these ways should provide a way
to keep the spark from igniting any gases.
