&gt; Hey Folks,
&gt; Just got back from Costa Rica.  I was able to see  4 buses, talk to one

&gt; So I also learned the ultimate road trip.... The Pan-American highway will
&gt; take you all the way from Alaska to Costa Rica, and perhaps beyond!!!  Now
&gt; that is an adventure waiting to happen.  My wife says I would never make it
&gt; past the Bandito's of Mexico or Nicaragua.  None the less, it is fun to

have driven the entire Pan American highway in Nicaragua from the Honduran
border to the Costa Rican border (unfortunately not in my bus) saw many
many buses but the most dangerous thing I saw was the panhandlers in the
streets begging  from the drivers..  in fact drove all over Nicaragua
except East of Estellie and didn't see anything but beautiful scenery,
fantastic people and lots and lots of buses.    (was told all the
Bandito's were in the Eastern Provences and the road doesn't go there.

would love to drive from pole to pole but as has been mentioned there is
the Darrien gap in Southern Pannama/Northern Columbia to deal with.

Bob
