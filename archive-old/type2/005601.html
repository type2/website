Subject: Fw: [T2] sliding door prob.

Proper lubrication of the pivot arm will require disassembly.
The spring is already unable to compensate the increased resistance.
Left alone, it will freeze with rust to the point it will not open.

&gt;Sounds like the nylon &quot;keeper&quot; is gone.
&gt;Have the same problem with my 76 Bus

&gt;Prob. 1: the sliding door works, EXCEPT, after you
&gt;&quot;pop&quot; the latch, the big hanger (thick curved steel
&gt;rod) in the groove on the top fails to pivot far enuf
&gt;to the rear to allow the door to slide back. You can
&gt;help it the rest of the way by pushing with your
&gt;fingers, then it slides to rear and locks correctly,
&gt;and it returns and latches fine. (I hope the
&gt;description is adequate.)
&gt;
&gt;No dents or rust in the door that I can see. Lube
&gt;doesn seem to help. Cud a spring or bushing be
&gt;missing?
