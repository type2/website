Subject: money and vehicles, paint and karma

I have for the most part given the &quot;paint&quot; thread a wide berth. (posted one
comment) I have never had a car painted. My Seirra weekender could have
used it, as she was pretty pale from 20 years on the beach, but no matter.
She was a good car and did right by me. But I am a little dismayed by the
turn of the conversation. 

I disagree with Whoever said that if bread was an issue, you shouldn't have
VW, I have found them to be just about the cheapest vehicle to run around.
No I may not have a 23 window, or a 71 double door delivery (whoops, I'm
drooling...) but when I had more money then time I drove a Izusu Trooper,
and everything on that vehicle was at least $75, and every breakdown was a
grand.

I say to each his own. If you want to spend ten grand on a show-quality,
better than mint paint job- good for you. Ill oooh and ahh at it- but if
its for sale, I wont even ask the price cause I know its not in my range.
If you are like me, and do you best to keep your car clean and running
good. Thats great too. Hell if you bought your van cause its your last $700
and you hate your housemates, and it just needs to run well enough so the
cops wont tow it, godspeed and good luck brother. I see no reason to put
anyone down because they don't drive your car. YMMV, hell mine has
considerably since the first time I pried a 72 motor out of a rustbucket
and into another bus with a better body.

All I am saying is lets all take the high road and not put down others.
This thread is dead as far as I can tell and I wont read/write anymore
about it.

my .02 anyway

Duncan
