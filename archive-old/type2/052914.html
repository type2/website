Subject: '78 ca smog q's - SUCCESS SANS CAT!

hey volks,

thanks for all the great advice! got the '78 rustfalia (haven't been able to
say that since retiring the old '71 :-) pre-smogged at 'allen smog' on san
fernando in burbank, ca (great and helpful place!), got a muffler at 'the
muffler shop' on san fernando in glendale, ca ($80 for a muffler installed
plus mucho welding and repair!), got the fi set at 'big nick's precision vw'
on magnolia in burbank, ca (even tho' nick ain't big ;-), he was fast,
friendly, cheap, and very helpful), then re-smogged at allen's. NO CAT and
she's running clean and legal! luckily, all my original vw emissions
stickers were in place saying &quot;NON-CATALYST&quot; and detailing the original
emissions specs, so no sweat.

i really missed the list the last couple of years. any other old timer's
&gt;from the pre-split vanagon list still around? unca joel? hoop? crazy dave e?
et al...
