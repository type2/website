Subject: Re: Interior panels for '62 23-Window?

If you or anyone else come across decent repros I would like to check into
them myself.
I'll be needing them somewhere towards the spring. My '64 deluxe sunroof has
a 
beutifull color green with a black mesh design. To bad my panels are wheather
damaged.

isn't that a lovely colour bus, inside and out?  Its my favourite.    It also
has the one year that colour scheme only green tinted vinyl headliner. 

I have found several nice set of panels for that style bus.  Where do you
live?
