Subject: Lubing the window regulator

I was wondering is it possible to grease parts of the window regulator
system without removing them from the door?  I'm talking about the 
drive cable and drive gear mechanism. I was thinking i could use a
solvent to clean out the old grease and then regrease everything with
wheel bearing grease. The problem is I don't know what to lube, its
so difficult to see up inside the door. Any advice?
