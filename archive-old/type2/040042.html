I was pmailing this but thought maybe someone else might have felt the
same way.

mike
only one thing bugged me a bit.
Ron(depot) posted about cheap sway bar kit and then when he got lots of
response came back with a great deal and said he could do it if he made a
fair sized order. It was only then that john c. posted that he would offer
the kit for a tad more but toss the shipping. He greped in on someone
elses sale. I know they are both just vendors trying to make sales but it
just felt to me like bad etiquette. I try to remember these things when
sending my money somewhere.
