In a message dated 99-07-14 12:05:18 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I read an article that claimed in 1997 only 17% of cars sold in NA were
 standard transmission.
 It predicted 13% for 1998, and asteep decline aft &gt;&gt;

Probably because most folks commute to work in their cars, and IMHO it aint no
fun driving a standard shift in rush hour traffic. In the Washington, DC area 
you are lucky if you can even get to 2nd gear during rush hour, which around 
here is pretty much from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm. Plus, it's a PITA trying to 
shift with a cigarette in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other!    Jeff
