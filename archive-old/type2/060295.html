paint in/out,perfect upholstery&amp;canvas, new tires
and shocks.I`ve taken her to a few VW shops,and
they all agree she is 67k original,runs and drives
excellent.Engine has never even been pulled.She is

cooler,Z-bed,upperbed,child`s cot and stool.She
has all her VW paperwork,key and even touch-up
