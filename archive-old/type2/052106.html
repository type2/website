&gt; Hey Guys,
&gt;
&gt; Well, I've still had no success with finding or adapting a tow bar to my
&gt; bus.  So, I went ahead and pulled it home on a flat bed trailer (yeah, that
&gt; was a fun tow).
&gt;
&gt; I cleaned the motor, put a spotlight on it, and added a little oil.  A
&gt; little bit of oil began dripping out from above the Oil Filler Pipe.  When I
&gt; touched the Rubber Bellows (the little rubber piece that goes over where
&gt; your dipstick fits in) oil went everywhere!
&gt;
&gt; It seems that at the bottom of the Oil Filler Pipe there is a Rubber Bellows
&gt; that fits where your Oil Dipstick goes in.  (Bentley Manual; Chapter 5, Page
&gt; 25, Figure 9-1, Part #12)  Could this really drain every bit of oil out of
&gt; my Bus?  It doesn't look like this little piece of rubber is all that well
&gt; mounted on there.

Darrin:
Yes; and yes (it's not very well mounted in there).
Cheesey might be a good word. Inches downwind from 600 degree heat exchangers
and handling the lifeblood of your engine!
The dipstick bellows on my 78 once gave out when I didn't have a spare and I
replaced it with a piece of fuel hose, probably 3/8&quot; or 5/16&quot; US size, and a
couple of small worm gear drive clamps. Much more substantial and never gave any
trouble again.
Good to know that VW eventually corrected their own mistake with a redesign on
the 80 Vanagon, fully 11 years after the type 4 came out.
This is why I don't have a whole lot of reverence for the caliber of German
engineering. (Maybe it's management's call- makes little difference when your
oil is on the ground and you're walking!)
