&gt; &gt; 20/50 might be the way to go, but I've run 40wt for years in the 2 liter
&gt; &gt; with no ill effects.  In the very hot triple digit weather of Northern Cal
&gt; &gt; in August/September I even ran 50wt in my 80 Vanagon.

Keep in mind that thick oil also flows through the oil cooler slower, so
running 50W might make your engine run a bit hotter than 40W.  As long as
the oil can maintain good pressure it doesn't help to run higher numbers.

I run 10W40 year round, mostly in SoCal, but sometimes in Nevada.
