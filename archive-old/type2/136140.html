Subject: Vehicle terminology

In Chevyspeak, a &quot;rat&quot;  is a big block and a
&quot;Mouse&quot; is a small block.  The other useage, as I
often refer to many of the campers around here as
desert rat, or my paint job as a rat paint job
(applied by brush), is a sort of derogratory term
meaning far from pristine.
