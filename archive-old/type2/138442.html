Subject: Oil Light

Last week I would drive my bus and it kept almost dying out at stop lights 
and getting off the express way (oil and gen. light would both come on) give 
it gas, and it would idle rough but the lights stayed out.

This weekend new points were put in and it was re-timed and the van drives 
DRAMATICALLY better.

Today, stopping at stoplights etc. was perfect...but getting off the 
expressway, the oil light flickered (no gen. light though!) ~gave it gas, it 
idle normally....

wondering what it could be...do you think it could be carb related?~I 
beleive the timing is right on, cuz if you ask me, the bus jets out and 
drives awesome.

advice....



Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
