Subject: The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

Does anybody have experience with using the new pertronix ignitor II in the 
009 dizzy?  On their website they say:
&quot;Adjusts spark timing over the entire RPM range to compensate for the 
inherent electronic delay resulting in more stable timing&quot;
Does that mean it intelligently advances or retards the spark as needed, 
thus perhaps solving some of the 009 problems?  Forgive my ignorance if this 
is a dumb question, I know almost nothing about distributors.
