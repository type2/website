Subject: fire paranoid or practical thinking?

There's been a lot of buzz about fire prevention since the BBB fire. It
has me thinking of reasonable ways to minimize the impact from the
gavity feed. Since motorcycles are gravity fed, and this issue was
resolved on those motors through the use of a vacuum petcock (in most
cases, especially newer ones), could this concept transfer to the bus?
I understand that some early models has a manual one. A poster
indicated that s/he installed a Honda motorcycle vacuum petcock onto
their fuel tank and was having sucess with that. I did some
investigation into a solenoid (electric) valve, but I didn't have much
luck. Any input from you all would be welcomed. Is this a good idea?
Would this just introduce another thing that could fail, causing more
frequent breakdowns without substantially improving fire safety?
I haven't been able to find in the Bentley (nor have I been able to get
a good measurement myself) the size of the threading at the tank. I
know some of you have installed a valve of some kind near your tank for
maintenance reasons, could you share the measurements you took? If this
is a workable idea, sizing and gal/min is important too, I reckon.
I really appreciate any advise you have to offer--
