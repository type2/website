Subject: getting &quot;all&quot; the hot air for heating

(^:  Gee, my 62 Ghia did just that- the old style 40hp engine tin
scavenged ALL the heat that blew through the cylinders and directed it
up front when you closed the rear flaps, along with all the oil fumes! I
assume early busses had the same?
       I got 100% of that air by tapping into the visible air tubes
under the rear seat (before it blew out the rusted through rockers),
directing it through flexible ducting under the seat and along the door
channel, and then up to 1.5&quot; drain pipe drilled with holes facing the
windshield- super defrosting!!!! Discolored a bit but did not melt or
poison me. That was a true Syracuse NY winter rat, push started it many
times with only 5 feet of road to spare!  Believe it passed inspection
with tractor light buckets bolted into the rotten light wells and the
spare tire was kept from rolling onto the ground by rope wrapped between
the bumper and upper torsion tubes!   Ahh, to get 40 mpg again.....
....Quoth DS&gt; -My personal opinion is
&gt; that for any heater to work directly from a bus engine, it will
&gt; have to be fed by ........the waste heat from
&gt; the cylinders (now there's an idea - lots of clean, hot air!).
