Subject: gaskets for t2 w/t1 engine?
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks! With the help of fellow listees I,ve concluded that my '70 camper has a type 1 '71 engine. She needs all new gaskets in the engine compartment, but will type 2 ones fit? Thanks in advance for any help, and busma to you all! Peace!
