Subject: rings

re:  re-ring when removing cylinders

and why exactly did you remove the cylinders?
:
rings have to wear in to seal. they wear mountains and valleys in
the rings that correspond to mountains and valleys in the cylinder
walls. It is this super close fitting that seals against blow by.
The rings and cylinders have to break in by wearing away metal to
create these matching channels. You disturbed the perfectly worn
in orientation of the rings when you pulled off the cylinders. It
will be impossible to re-orient the rings to match these
microscopic mountains and valleys. If you do not buy new rings,
your old rings will have to wear in and cut new mountains and
valleys. You will be wasting ring material and wasting cylinder
wall material. Rings are so cheap that you should purchase new
rings.

There are various &quot;rules&quot; for breaking in rings depending on who
you believe. I always break in rings according to the instructions
in the ring package. I lubricate the cylinder wall and inbetween
the rings when I install the cylinders over the rings. I always
check the ring gap. I have never had to adjust the ring gap with
new rings and &quot;good as-new&quot; cylinders. However, I always check the
ring gap to verify the condition of the cylinder. If the ring gap
is excessive, then the cylinder is worn oversize. In some engines,
you can have the cylinders ground oversize and install oversize
pistons and matching oversize rings. I don't think VW makes
oversize pistons. You just have to buy new cylinders if they are
worn past the wear limit. If the cylinders are too large inside
diameter from wear, the the rings cannot reach out far enough to
seal. I have done the el-cheap route and put in oversized rings on
wornout pistons and wornout cylinders. In this case, you have to
grind away the ring end gap to make the ring gap large enough to
allow ring expansion. Of course, this is an el cheapo repair and
the results are not as good as doing the job correctly. Blow by
and oil burning happen pretty quickly.

It is always better to do the job correctly. There are many other
things to look for on the pistons and cylinder walls to determine
if they are worn out. So you should show the parts to an
EXPERIENCED  AIR COOLED automotive machinist. e.g. scuffing;
broken lands; worn out lands; loose pistin pin holes. so, I guess
that is a good reason to remove the cylinders on an engine of
unknown mileage and or abuse.

misc thoughts: Pistons are not round. Pistons pins are not
centered in the piston. Pistons have to be installed in the
correct orientation. There is an arrow stamped in the top of the
piston. The arrow points to the flywheel. If reusing parts, keep
the same piston with the same cylinder. clean the ring grooves in
the piston, CLEAN out the holes in the ring grooves. I like
soaking pistons in carburetor cleaner.
