&gt; Kristen gave me a hug as she was leaving. It's kinda sad to think that I
&gt; might have been the last decent person she met in this world. If you're
&gt; thinking for a minute that there's a problem with the AIRS list, just
&gt; remember that without that list, she wouldn't have even met me...nor I her.
&gt; There are, of course, a bunch of things I would do differently if I could
&gt; now, like beg her to crash here at the house...but I'm not about to blame
&gt; myself or the AIRS list or any other act of kindness. It was a cruel person
&gt; who did this...I hope they get caught.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks! Joe

   Whatever we can do to see justice done here, must be done. There are not words
in my vocabulary capable of sustaining my disgust with the person (? sorry,
shouldn't elevate the slime ball bas*ard to that level) who took this young
lady's life.

   Cripes, she's was just a nickel older than my daughter.........
