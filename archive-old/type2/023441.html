&lt;&lt; Tomorrow, I'm off to the dune buggy shop to get a 
     &quot;heavy duty&quot; fork.  &gt;&gt;

Good points on the T/O arms and where they were.  I have
recently started having my local shop fillet weld the arms
fully onto the shaft as George suggested.  The wear behind
wear the early style T/O bearing rides on the fingers is rarely
checked by most folks and can cause the problems mentioned.

Cast a sharp eye on those Mexican or Brazilian gold Zinc
plated arms.  Quality control on those range anywhere from 
great to poor.  If you can, take the old T/O shaft lever with you
and see if it fits the splines.  I've seen some that the splines
are cut fully and the lever won't go on with a 3# hammer and
I've seen splines where the lever rocks back and forth waaaaay
too much.  Also, if you can get the solid bronze T/O shaft guides
for the early 16mm shafts then do so by all means!  The aluminum
sleeve with the nylon insert and two rubber grommets are OK but
I really think that the solid bronze sleeve provides the best support.
Avoid the red urethane ones if possible!

The red urethane ones are to be avoided
