Hello List,

   Does $2000 sound high for a rebuilt type 2 engine installed? Hows about 
7- $800 for a tranny? If you think these prices are high and know what I 
should pay to have this done please let me know. Also if you know of a good 
mechanic in Delaware or that area please let me know.

Regards,

Joe
