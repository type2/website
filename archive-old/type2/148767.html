Subject: Re: [T2] 73 bus brake booster vacuum hose

Hi,

It is an automatic..  The &quot;vacuum modulator&quot; on the rear of the trans
goes to another nipple on the &quot;balance pipe&quot; that the brake booster
goes to.

I looked harder in the manual.  EGR system has a line going to the
brake booster vacuum line.  This is supposed to go to some sort of
solenoid setup, and allow vaccum to get to the diaphragms on the
intake manifold.

I cannot find this solenoid.  I can't even find where the small tube
from the brake booster went to.  The T on the vacuum hose is forward
of the 1 way valve.  Somehow the brakes control EGR?

Jenny


&gt; Is your 73 an automatic by any chance?  If it is it may go to the vacuum
&gt; modulator on the rear of the transmission
