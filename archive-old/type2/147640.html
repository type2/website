Subject: Help! - WTB 1973 Bus Auto Transmission Parts

Hola,

Where is a good place to buy parts for an Automatic Transmission out of a
1973 Westy? I have the transmission torn down and need to completely rebuild
it. I am not having much luck finding parts. Any thoughts?

 

Thank you for your help!!!

 

Wishing you many miles of smiles!

Todd Olson
