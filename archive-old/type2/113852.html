&gt;This is why I say no always to aftermarket oil coolers for VW's. Everyone ever in my shop what there for a new motor due to lubrication failure.

I've noticed that correlation also with the type IV.  However the setup in the Mustang is identical to the Ford OEM police package, except that I am using better quality hose and hardware.

&gt;Don't fear high oil temps. 

Hey, we actually agree on something.  :-)

&gt;And it really is folly to compare a water cooled V-8 Ford with an air cooled VW.

They both use oil to lubricate the crank and cam, and the temperature of that oil will have the same effect on either engine's bearings.
