Subject: Re: [T2] brakes on  a 78 bus

Can't remember exactly - either caliper is removed or the pads slide in 
with the caliper in place. You do not however split the caliper!

You'll probably need to bleed the system anyhow. Might be a good time the 
flush the system.

I'd advise you spend a bit of money and buy a good shop manual (this a good 
excuse!) - I prefer Bentley but the Haynes will certainly do the job. Even 
Muir got this part right I think (I like his book too).

&gt;It kinda looks like the calipers spilt, but when I loosen the fluid comes 
&gt;out?  Please advise.
