&gt; He said they don't make that particular shape regulater anymore, but
&gt; the same company makes the same thing but not rectangular.  Not too
&gt; expensive for a new regulater, but a lot to install it.  Is this
&gt; something I can do on my own?

Yes

Has anyone tried this before?

Yes, me.

&gt; Playing with propane has me concerned.  Is this safe or do I need
&gt; special tools?

Kyle, playing with Propane *should* have you concerned, but that is about
the right level... concerned.  Not frightened, not paniced.  This is dirt
simple if you have ever worked with your brakes, or with a toilet or sink.
The connections are very standard compression fitting and all you need to
do is:

close off the propane (that valve is separate and you will not be
  touching it),
drop the shield and tank onto a low bench/footstool,
disconnect the feeds to the appliance(s) (stove if you have a bay or
  fridge and stove if you have a vanagon),
remove the old regulator from the main valve,
attach the new regulator to the valve,
attach the appliance(s) to the new regulator,
test for leaks with soapy water,
tighten leaky fittings,
test for leaks with soapy water,
reattach tank and shield to bus,
test for leaks with soapy water,
done.
(BTW, you might want to test for leaks with soapy water after a week or
so, just in case :-)

As i remember from when John and I replaced mine, the Vanagon one was a
hair longer than the original and we had to carefully and creatively benfd
the appliance lines to get the tank back on, but it was a simpe
replacement.

&gt; Also, evertime I put a fuse in my H2O pump it blows almost
&gt; immediately.  I've tried fuses for different amps and they still blow.
&gt; Is the pump no good?

99% of the time, yes!  the other 1% it is a short in the wiring.

&gt; Also, he said that my oulet wasn't working because I need a new
&gt; breaker.  Anybody know if you can buy just the breaker?  Anyone have a
&gt; part number?

You can just buy a breaker.  They are very standard 15amp breakers and any
home depot/lowes/hardware store will have it.  Take the old one along, as
the form factors vary considerably!

On a related note, I have been thinking of installing a GFCI breaker in my
bus.  I like the idea since I may well be camping by times in the wet, but
am not exactly sure if it would work.  The worry I have is that since hte
bus ground (the body of the bus) is insullated from the earth ground (I
know, I just made a pun in Britain :) and GFCI depends on the difference
between ground and ground, will I run into problems?  Will it work at all?
