&gt;
&gt;Sounds like it might be oil starvation.  Do you have an oil pressure gauge?
&gt;
&gt;

I do and on top of that since I get such lousy mileage I refuel every 145
miles or so and top up the oil with about 4oz of precious synthetic. I don't
really loose that 4oz of oil if I'm on the highway, instead it oozes out of
those damned valve covers, vaporizes in the windstream and ends up as a fine
coat of goo all over the back of the van. Otherwise, in the current temps of
around 65* with 20/50, my pressure is 40 at 50mph. 

Thanks,

Weston
