Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Curtains-make your own

You can do your own- Note I did not split the rear side windows as they
can be pushed back from the front-nor did I split the jalousie cover on
the driver side, as it pushes back from the rear seat-  I have 7,
including a divider curtain behind the front seats- they are triple
layered to be warmer and block light.  The inner layer is a light color
to reflect interior light. See http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin
I used the stock rails to hold sewn over loops.

 I'm looking to put curtains in my 73 Westy.  I'm starting from nothing.
&gt;Do they just use snaps or are there rods also?
