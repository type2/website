Subject: Re: [T2] Delayed starting, or no starting on cold morning??

&gt;I went to start my 77 Westy this morning, and the lights etc came on 
&gt;but nothing from the starter.

...

&gt;  The battery terminals etc were all cleaned about a month ago.

	Does that 'etc' include the earthing bolt from the battery to 
the 'frame'?  If not, the grounding bolt will do   ;-)   If corrosion 
has caused a high resistance to develop there, lights etc will work 
but a hundred amp or so for the starter will not flow. At least undo 
it a half-turn and re-tighten; better, remove &amp; clean.
