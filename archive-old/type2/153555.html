Subject: SDC - Everybus T's : TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

Hey everyone,
Well, now is the time! If you were considering getting an unofficial SDC
&quot;People's Republic of Everybus&quot; T, you've got to act NOW!
As it stands, there will be NO shirts for sale (from us) at the event. SO, to
get in on the deal, you have to order by the end of this week.

For more information, styles, and ordering, visit
http://www.suburbandesigncore_dot_com/store/

If you have any questions, you can pmail me at art _at_ suburbandesigncore_dot_com

Thanks!
Adoom
