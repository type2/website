If you think you got a $100.00 bus then paint it with a brush.
If you think a little more of your bus, save your money untiul you can do
a job you'll be proud of.
My 83 Westfalia has some minor dents in the left quarter panel and a few
hail dents, I feel that it is better leaving these non-rusting dents
alone rather than using body filler or any other fix. I just have never
had any luck matching 18 year old paint and I don't care to nickname my
van pinto.
Restoring a vehicle isn't an overnight project, be patient and you can
enjoy your van as you work through the process of getting everything just
the way you want it.
I've seen a lot of vans at VW Camping and Swap meets with considerable
rust and most owners are more concerned about the safety and nechanical
reliability than the repairing the rust.
Many vans rust out from the inside from window leaks and other various
sources and all that must be addressed before you fill, paint or peform
any cosmetic bodywork. A bad paint job is a lot harder to get off than it
is to put on.

&gt; Terry, Joe:
&gt; Good point, Terry! I've painted a few cars and thought the materials 
&gt; were
&gt; pretty expensive and I was just buying Ditzler/PPG, not the 
&gt; expensive foreign
&gt; brands. but I was never tempted to use another product, cause I'd 
&gt; not EXPECT
&gt; it to work.
&gt; Joe, if you really don't CARE what color, maybe you should check at 
&gt; auto
&gt; paint suppliers for mis-tints. I'd guess they mess up sometimes and 
&gt; have
&gt; products they can't sell to the intended buyer. Keep in mind, you 
&gt; may not be
&gt; able to match it, if it's truly a mistint. At this point, it 
&gt; basically has
&gt; become hazardous waste, so you'd think they might be able to sell it 
&gt; to you
&gt; for 1/3 to 1/2 the intended price. A friend of mine used to buy 
&gt; large lots of
&gt; industrial paint from S-W for $1 per gallon!
&gt; Another source would be body shops, who also might find extra paint 
&gt; on hand.

&gt; &gt; Joe,
&gt; &gt; All paint, be it automotive, or house paint is actually oil
&gt; &gt; based.(excluding latex)
&gt; &gt; The only difference is, house paint lacks the flow 
&gt; characteristics, uv
&gt; &gt; inhibitors, and driers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you go ahead and blow this SW, house paint on your bus, the 
&gt; tack-up
&gt; &gt; time is so long, you best have a vacuum chamber to have it dry in, 
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; if you don't, the bus will be so full of bugs and dust, it will 
&gt; look
&gt; &gt; like a &quot;Chea Pet.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe K-tel, or who ever makes the Chea stuff, is missing the 
&gt; boat!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps the Chea-Bus will be a new Christmas time fad !!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cool !!----Go for it !! :&gt;)
