&gt; Why overload a single wire if you don't have to?

A better reason for two feed wires is to leave one of your lights on if
the other circuit has a problem.  Having had a headlight burn out while
riding my motorcycle on a twisting mountain road on a moonless night I can
see the value of redundancy!

BTW, the stock wiring is redundant, IIRC, from the fuse block on.  Each
headlight has its own fuse.
