I have a &quot;73 Type 2 camper with a 1700 cc with a single Weber carb,
which I want to rebuild as a 1800 cc with hydraulic lifters. I am
shopping for parts and replacement rebuild kits, and would appeciate any
recommendations (or ideas!) for parts or kits, such as: &quot;Who has the
best kit?&quot;, or &quot;Where do I go for the heads least likely to crack under
30,000 miles?&quot;
