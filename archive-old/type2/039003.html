Subject: Re: windows

I've got four '67 Westy louvered windows and frames that I don't plan on using. Would love to see them go to a happy home somewhere.

Anybody want to trade a stock fan shroud for a chrome one? And trade a couple of chrome valve covers (dolt-on) for a pair of stock covers and bail..?
