Subject: [T2] In need of interior parts ( special cargo door handle)


&gt; Hello List,
&gt;
&gt; My friend has a 71 bus and is looking for a few parts
&gt; for it. He needs the inner cargo (sliding) door
&gt; handle. He said that the one he needs is NOT the kind
&gt; with the small square fitting but one with a fitting
&gt; that is &quot;oval with 4 splines&quot;.


I hate to tell you this but...... the &quot;oval with 4 splines&quot; piece is what is
cast into the plastic handle. His plastic handle broke off and that is what is
left. It WILL come off the square shaft. Throw it out and get any handle......
