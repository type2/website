Hello all. It's been awhile since I've posted to list but I'm back.
Unfortunately it's with a problem. I have a 78 westy 2.0l with FI and it has
developed a few probs. First I noticed that the gas mileage was not near as
good as it should have been and gradually got worse. It has no power beyond
35 mph and has the symptoms of restricted gas but do to the amount of gas I
am consuming I don't think that is the problem. I spoke with Sean Bartnik
earlier and he advised that it was probably the temp II sensor so I got out
the old meter and sure enough it was reading about 480 and Bentley calls for
it to be around 2500 at 65 degrees. So my wife and I went to the only FLAPS
that was open and of course it will be tomorrow before we can get on the
road.
I have all new injectors and all cylinders are working as far as I can tell.
I was just wondering if anyone else might have anything else that I might
check since we'll be here at least till tomorrow.

Thanks Sean for the help and thanks in advance for any other input

Chris and Jessica
