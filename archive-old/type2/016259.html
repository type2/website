Subject: Auxilary heating fan for the bus
References: &lt;199810080337.UAA31810_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

I thought I'd annoyed damn near everyone with my rants on this subject.
I got my '78 up to a level of heating which at least quieted my wife's
annoyance at the loss of her '89 Honda, and at most is really quite
toasty.

Here's my gig:

1)  At night, have one person shining a powerfull flashlight around the
edges of the doors while the other is inside looking for light leaks.
Then, silicone them seals within an inch of their lives, until no more
light leaks through.  Pay a lot of attention to the sliding door, which
is a freaking sieve.  Also check the pedals in front and the e-brake,
where plenty of cold air can stream in.

2)  Crawl underneath and make sure the controls at the front are
actually hooked up to the two heater boxes.  Part of my own puzzle was
solved by one of the boxes being totally unconnected.  Doh!

3)  Take a roll of duct tape and tape the crap out of every single tube
that carries hot air.  From the aux. blower in the engine compartment to
the bottom, underneath from the boxes to the accordian tubes that go to
the Y.  Mine was leaking plenty of air around the seams.  Is duct tape
the best way to do it?  Probably not, but that's never stopped me
before.

4)  Get an Atwood 3&quot; inline bilge blower from the marine place ($25.00,
I think).  Also get a length of 3&quot; PVC tube.  Pull that cardboard piece
of crap from the center of the bus and stick the tube in, splicing the
blower into it near the front of the bus.  It's a snap to wire up to a
switch, though the amperage has to be relatively high.  Then stick the
cardboard tube back over the whole shindig and stick it in the bus.  How
do you keep it all together?  Why, duct tape, of course!

That's what I did, anyway.  As pundits may be quick to point out, the
extra blower does nothing to speed up the (leisurely) rate at which your
air heats up.  But once it does heat up, Margaret, hide the kids.  The
night after I put it in was the first that my wife asked me to turn down
the heat.

It worked like gangbusters for me, anyway.
