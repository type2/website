Subject: Front table

    I just got a table for the front of my 78 Westy(thanks Mike). I 
don't have the brackets that hook
to the dash or even know what they look like. If someone has an extra 
set let me know. I also would
like to see a picture of what they look like installed if possible. I 
also wanted to thank everyone for
there reply to my sender inquiry earlier this week.
