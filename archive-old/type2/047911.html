RULE ONE: One thing at a time.  When it don't go, you KNOW what's wrong.
&gt;diagnosed the problem as my left-side cylinders are not firing.  There's a
&gt;spark going to each of the left-side spark plugs.  I'm basically running on
&gt;only the right-side of my engine.  Since it's been raining here in NorCal
&gt;since Tuesday night, and I don't have a covered space to work on my bus, I
&gt;may not be able to pull the left-side valve cover until the weekend.

Check compression.  You may have a leak between the cylinders.  (Not likely.)
Probably the fuel.  Check gaskets on the intake manifold. What Weber?  If
it's a two bbl, check the left barrel.
