Subject: Engines Out!!

hey volks,
well i got up this morning and went determined to yank
the motor out of Lizzy.   turned out it was a lot
easier than expected.   took about 2 hours total to
have it out and sitting behind my bus.   im gonna make
a detailed write up w/ pics and post it on my site
later in the week so enough of that, down to business.
  after i pulled it out i took off the passenger side
head and took a look at the #1 piston...whoa!! looks
like it melted down on the upper right hand corner.  
looks like most of the tiny melted pieces stayed in
the combustion area as stuff is glued all ove the
inside of the head around the valves, but it looks
like it will clean up fine and no problems with the
heads(thank god! seeing there new AVP)  anyways my
question is where do i go from here, obviously the
piston and sleeve will have to be replaced, but do i
just replace that one( i doubt it?), or do all 4.
steer me in the right direction please.   all help is
appreciated.   for a better idea, i posted a couple
pics of the sleeve and piston at:
