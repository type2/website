Subject: Re: [T2] Friday-Deadheads and busses

&gt;maybe that is the problem with my bus, no stickers and owned by
&gt;someone who preferred NPR and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;


And who listens to NPR today? Can you say &quot;children of the 60s&quot;?

If you're bus's P.O. listens to NPR today, I'd say there's no problem --
should be lots of good karma coming outta them pistons ;)
