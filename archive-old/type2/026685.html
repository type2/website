Sorry I don't know the answer to your problem Chris, but your post prompted
me to share something with the list.

I didn't want to spend the big bucks for the big vacuum line.  The original
line looked good, but when I took it off, submerged it in water and blew
through it with the other end plugged, the entire hose fizzed air bubbles
like an air stone in an aquarium.  So, I cut a piece of 1/2&quot; ID copper pipe,
the bendable type, not the rigid type, and carefully bent it by hand to
perfectly fit the space where the original went.  I fed it in from the rear
to the front and did a little bending along the way.  Pretty easy.  Make
sure the pipe doesn't touch anything.  Copper pipe butts up to the
connections completely end-to-end, with a 3&quot; length of regular rubber hose
to connect the ends.  Had to make a second piece that fits between the
manifold/check valve and the fire wall.  Copper pipe goes all the way
between the manifold/valve and the brakes with no reliance on rubber hose
except for the three fittings used to hold it together.  Even if these
crack, it won't leak because I installed them with silicone rubber.
Originally thought that I would have to account for the engine movement in
relation to the body with a short piece of the vacuum hose, but since VW
wouldn't sell me just a short piece I went without it.  I found that I
didn't need it if I didn't attach the pipe anywhere to the body.  The pipe
just hangs between the two end points.  I've put almost 100K miles on this
set up without the slightest wear and no leaks.  Looks like it will last at
least another 900K miles or more.  I'll probably replace the 3&quot; fittings in
another 100K or two.
