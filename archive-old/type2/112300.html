Subject: Re: [T2] making valve cover gaskets stick to valve covers

Elijah,
I have found that Permatex &quot;High Tack&quot; on the valve cover and
gasket--let dry and stick that sucker on there--
It's a done deal--no leaking.

9 times out of 10, the cover surface is Ca-Ca--and this is where the oil
dribbles from--not between the gasket and the head.

Now if your really desperate--and have some sort of other problems--GM
gasket sealer is the ultimate best of all the best--but you have to let
it set up overnight, prior to starting the engine--nothing leaks through
this stuff., and is very easily removable, if you want to work on the
engine later on.

Later,

Terry

what is the best product to use when glueing the valve cover gaskets to
valve covers. despite taking all of the necassary precautions and having
decent covers mine seem to leak more often than i care to admit.
  so please enlighten me.
so what is the best glue, sealant, tooth paste, tar, chewing gum, or
whatever it is you use that will make them stick and keep my valve
covers from leaking oil. and if possible be specific about the product
used.
