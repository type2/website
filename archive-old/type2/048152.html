I have an 81 Westy that was a European model, thus no FI.  The motor is
recently rebuilt, and runs well.  However, I still question whether the
dizzy is correct.

Prior to rebuild, the car had a Weber progressive on it, and a dual vacuum
advance dizzy.  Motor was shot, thus no power.

After rebuild, switched to dual Weber 44's, great power to 55mph, then
really none in 4th gear.  I am running 009 dizzy now.

The car is not getting very good mileage compared to an FI vehicle.  And the
power from the 44's is not felt.  Any ideas?  I would like better MPG, and
power.
