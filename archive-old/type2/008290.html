Subject: mail order motors? whos the best not just the most?
Date: Thu, 11 Feb 1999 01:53:00 -0500

are mail order motors a good thing ? if so from who? can anyone tell me
their experiences with these companies good or bad. i have been told to
stay away from these places. i live in nj and most all of these companies
are in cal so warrienties may be a bit of a problem when it comes to
shipping it back if a problem ever came about. 
also i would like to know if anyone can reccomend a good all around vw
mech. in the southern nj or phila area? all of your comments and advice
would be very helpful. i want to thank the fellow type2ers 
who have helped me already thanks again.
if anyone is around the souht jersey area when traveling and i can be of
assistance feel free
or if any experienced type2ers would like to give a hand with my westy
lunch and beers are on me
thanks for your time rich
