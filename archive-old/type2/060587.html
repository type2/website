&gt;Since no one else answered your questions I'll give them a shot.  The
&gt;transmission changed in 1972 with the new 1700 engine and again in 1974 with
&gt;the new 1800 engine. I have always understood the gears became progressively
&gt;taller with each new transmission. I know Rocky Mountain Motorworks lists a
&gt;different transmission and part number for each engine.

The ratios did get progressively taller, with the exception of 4th gear in
the 74 trans, which stayed effectively the same between 72 and 74 because
the taller ring and pinion ratio more or less cancelled out the shorter 4th
gear ratio.
