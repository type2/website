&gt; &quot;No it doesn't.  in fact, the &quot;twist&quot; direction is the same if you swap the

&gt; folks find that swapping left-for-right quiets noisy joints, but I prefer to 
&gt; replace joints if I have the axle off.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; This has got me wondering what the thought is about swapping left for right 
&gt; when re-installing freshly greased, healthy joints. Is this thought to 
&gt; extend joint life?? or does this create other problems??

Some folks claim it extends joint life by bringing new wear surfaces into
play.  Others claim that the joints get worn in in one direction and that
switching directions will cause more wear.

Which is the truth?  Without an extended study it's hard to tell.  Ten
buses with identical maintainance for 100,000 miles should do it!

Personally, I simply try to have the least number of grease encounters!
