&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if there is such thing as a driver's side sliding
&gt; &gt; door?  I was just wondering, cause there seems to be an upper sliding
&gt; &gt; track built into mine on the drivers side, where it is on the other
&gt; &gt; side.  Was there like an option to have 2 sliding doors or one on the
&gt; &gt; opposite side, and if there was, where would I be able to obtain one?
&gt;
&gt; I think that's to accommodate right-hand drive (as in _dot_uk and .au).

There are double-sliding-door bay window buses.  Not many of them made it
to the US.
