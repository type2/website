Subject: Re: Oil capacity - perplexed 

Jason,
My oil change procedure is about the same as you. I add half quart
of oil to the filter, then fill the sump with about 3 quarts. I'm not
sure what causes the false full reading on the dipstick but it happens
on my bus and others too. Its kind of a unwritten rule I guess that
you have to start the bus up let it run for a minute or so then shut
it down. Wait a hour or so for the oil to drain back into the sump,
then recheck the oil level.  It should be between the two marks on
your dipstick.

Alex
