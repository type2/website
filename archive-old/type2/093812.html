&gt;1.  When pulling off the flexible couplings to the heat exchangers, I got a

.  I'm considering a high-end rebuild from Gary's VW in San Diego, because

There is a pair of white asbestos collars between the flexible hose and the heater flapper boxes as seen here:

Do not breathe, handle with gloves, etc.  It's evil stuff especially if it's disturbed.

If you search the archives you'll find mention that this unavailable item can be replaced with a vanagon part.  If yours is falling apart badly it may not survive putting the engine back together.
