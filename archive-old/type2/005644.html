    I have a slight problem with the recently aquired '71 westy.  The poptop
doesn't seem to come down completely in the front (FIF).  There are a couple
of &quot;p&quot; shaped clips under the front center, one attached to the poptop, and
one attached to the roof.  They just don't seem to match up!  Am I missing a
part? Do the two clips snap together?
    They line up like &quot;pd&quot;.  Should they hook together like &quot;dp&quot;?
(sorry, first attempt at ascii art)
    I was about to adjust the hinges to fix, but I'm not sure which way they
should go.
    I can't find anything in Muir, Haynes, or Bentley.  Much less the
archives.
    Are they there to keep the top from coming up while driving?

TIA
