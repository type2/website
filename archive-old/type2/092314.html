&gt; I am bringing in my 74 Camper

&gt; possible - transport and storage are already expensive enough ...


Marcus,,
you didn't mention what country you are importing the camper to,,,, but when I
imported my 1974 into CANADA, The Canadian Customs wanted Tax and Duty on
$1500.00 Canadian dollars,, a value out of their price book.

That was in 1990, to Canada from u.s.a. They wanted 6% duty on a &quot;VAN&quot; and 15%
duty on &quot;CAMPERS&quot; , so when I presented the &quot;VAN&quot; at the border,, I made sure I
called it a &quot;VAN&quot;  numerous times, so they would look in the book under &quot;VANS&quot;.

Call the Canadian border crossings and see if they have a book value.  Then get
them to fax it on a letter head, 

Hope that helps
