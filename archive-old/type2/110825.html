Subject: [T2] refinished b4 &amp; after pics.

well i sent the pics of now yesterday but didnt have the pics of before so here they are now...

when i purchased this bus it was in pretty bad shape.
Rust had eaten through it and i found over 5 rat nest inside it under the old bench seats cause it was a transporter.
\now she is cleaned insulated and also is ready to camp...
i will be fixing her up with new parts this weekend so hopefully i can finally put her on the road.
