&gt; ...(Replacement fuel filler necks from The Bus Depot) would work on

&gt; ...a perfectly good 1979 bus cannot be licensed or driven without this 
&gt; unobtanium part (#119A, not #119).

&gt; My mechanic has a 1979 bus that cannot leave. It is now in bus limbo... 
&gt; His customer is, as you would expect, not at all pleased. If it goes up 
&gt; for sale, I will get a one-day trip permit and move it out 
&gt; of state or scrap it for parts. Seems a darn shame.

I don't know what the state of CA expects. Maybe they expect that you will
sell your old car and support their well-heeled auto industry constituents by
buying an exorbitantly priced new car. But I know what is required here.

What is required is someone with the legally required restrictor who trusts
you enough to loan you theirs to pass the inspection. Or a group of people
who could share a spare one if one can ever be found. A parts-sharing coop. 
As previously noted, after 25 years old, cars are exempt from the smog 
tests, so most of us only need to pass 1-2 more tests at most. I knew 
folks in Oakland in the early 80's who were doing exactly that with some 
hard to find stock carbeurator for 1600 engines. For that matter, I know 
a smog station in San Diego that has a whole stock, smog-able 1600 engine 
sitting in the corner. They install it in VWs just long enough to pass 
smog, then remove it and put in whatever street illegal suped up thing 
their muscle engine fancy dictates. 

You would be violating the letter of the law, but well in keeping with 
the spirit of the law. In my book, that's what matters. 

Drive safely,
Surfer Bob
1978 Westfalia (that needs to pass smog this month)

PS- Seems like another tactic would be to store the bus 'til 2004, then 
register it in that year, when it is 25 years old and excempt from smog.
