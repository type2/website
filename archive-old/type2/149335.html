Subject: Re: [T2] Our tire fits what other vehicles?

Hi Mike,

If they DEMAND an aspect ratio, keep looking; they aren't interested  
in serving our market. Tell the vendor you are looking for a truck  
tire and they will stop demanding the middle number.

185R14 translates roughly to 185/82R14, but you'll never see it  
listed as such. I have also seen it put into a computer as 185/0R14.

The other way to go is with an off-road designation, which might be  
particularly useful with the wranglers: 27.5 x8x14. (that is not a  
translation though, just an example off the top of my head)_

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; My daughter slashed a Wrangler LT on some construction metal- can  
&gt; anyone tell me what other vehicles use our size (185R14C)?  Also,  
&gt; what is the actual &quot;aspect ratio&quot; as some search options ask for?
