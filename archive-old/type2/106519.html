Subject: Bolt-On Valve Covers?

I have been wrestling with the phantom valve cover leak for too long and
considering going to bolt on coversfor my 2.0 type IV engine. I have tried
a variety of fixes ranging from cork to synthetic gaskets, glue, no glue,
new stock covers, new bails, tweaking the bails so they fit tighter... Some
times they leak a little, some times they don't. Anyway I am sick of
messing with them every time I set my valves. So what I am wondering is can
anyone reccommend a good source for bolt on's. I don't want a set that
takes some hard to find special gasket either. Maybe one of you folks has a
good set they would like to sell?
