Subject: VDO tachometer problem

Dear Type2 friends,

Maybe some experienced people could help me out here!
I put in a VDO tachometer and it works.
I got a 74 2L carb.
The only thing which needs some attention is that the rmp vary a lot when
driving at a constant speed. If I drive around 60mph the tachometer shows
around 4000rpm in 4th gear! Is this correct and schould it be like this, or
is this too high?
And at this constant speed the variation can be from 3800rmp till 4200rmp..
I think that's a big variation!
How does this occur and what can I do to make it more stable?
Thanks to all of u!
