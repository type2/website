&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I want to flush the brake lines in my van and I was wondering how many 
&gt;bottles I can expect to need.  For obvious reasons I don't want to run out 
&gt;half way through the procedure, or be left with extra bottles when I am 
&gt;done.  Thanks for the imput
&gt;

No way to know before hand how much will be needed. For really dirty gunked
up systems, I flush 2 pints through, let it set for a few hours, then flush
through another 2 pints. For periodic maintenance (yearly) it takes about a
pint and a half to get clean fluid through all the bleeders.
