Subject: 34PICT4 on a 1776?

Volks,
Well, dropped off my engine case for a rebuild.  Now the machinist says
the case is no good.  He's trying to sell me a new case.  I could
probably get if for ~$175.  The caveat:
He picked up a bunch of parts from a FLAPS going out of business. Ended
up with a mixed case.  One side is new. One side has been opened up for
90.5mm cylinders.  I have given some thought to building a 1776 per
Hoover's recommendation.  The question is will a 34PICT4 be o.k. on the
larger engine.  I know it's not ideal, but I really don't want to get
into dual carbs.  I would love to have the Miller F.I. system, but just
don't have the cabbage right now.  There are 2 plusses to this case; 1.
It's a brand new AS41, 2. It's already tapped for full flow.  I've got
to figure something out if I'm going to make it to the www.type2_dot_com
campout in April!
Opinions?
TIA
