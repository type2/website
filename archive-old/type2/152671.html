Subject: Re: [T2] ign switch part question

Hi Joel

&quot;Notches&quot;......If you are speaking of the &quot;tab&quot; with the hole on one
side, this should locate where the locking grubscrew goes to hold the
switch in place in the housing.  On the opposite side there is a &quot;pin&quot;
to help locate the switch into the housing.  I have on my desk a brand
new switch, a very old used switch and they are both almost identical
in appearance.  The &quot;almost&quot; is that original switches came with three
wires and the new replacements (OE or otherwise) come with 4 wires.
You don't use the 4th wire (18 gauge Grey) as this is used on models
elsewhere in the world, it's sort of an &quot;accessory position&quot; that was
never available to the North American market (bummer, that would have
been nice).  The other three wires are Black (14-16 gauge), Red (10
gauge) and Red w/Black Stripe (12 gauge).  On a further note, there
has been an aftermarket switch available with an additional Black
w/Yellow Stripe Wire (12 gauge).  Don't need to use that either.  Why
so many different ones?  It's called production consolidation to
utilize it in more applications and keeping the cost low.  OE and
aftermarket switches have worked fine for me and I've yet to have a
problem with one. Also, the 311 905 865A switch is encased in metal,
not white plastic like the 71-Early 74 (111 905 865F).  However,
dimensions on both switches are identical (with both the tab and pin
described above), so theoretically you could swap the switches.

Now let's try something else.  When I sell a switch, I tell the
customer some neat valuable information.  The replacement switch comes
with that &quot;accessory&quot; wire (I described above) and not to use it.  But
I go further and tell the customer that the newer switch has 4
positions (the 4th being the spring-loaded start position) instead of
the 3 (the 3rd being the spring-loaded start position) the original
has.  Why do I do this?  Because if someone takes the replacement
switch and with a screwdriver sets in the in the far left position,
the switch won't go into the housing!  I take the replacement switch,
turn it all the way over the left (1st) position, then click it to the
right one position.  From Left to Right (clockwise) Position 1 on the
new switch is &quot;accessory&quot;, position 2 is OFF, Position 3 is ON and
Position 4 is START.  Be sure your Ignition Lock Cylinder/Steering
Lock/Housing is in the normal OFF position, then set your switch in
the 2nd position and it SHOULD slide right in.  Try it and see what
happens.

Problem with the later year style ignitions &amp; lock housings is that
the Housing Cover is different and it (and possibly the Steering
Column Tube) has to be changed out (someone correct me if I happen to
be wrong on this one - I know I did this on a 69 Camper when
installing a 71&amp;later assembly way back in the mid 70s).

&gt; hmmm....this is really odd. i am finding that 311 905 865 A will definitely
&gt; *not* fit the housing i have, which accoring to the numbers in this quoted
&gt; post, DO fit 68-69:
&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; there are clearly 2 'notches' on the electrical portion (aforementioned 311
&gt; 905 865 A) that do NOT line up with the 69-69 housing (211 905 889).
&gt;
&gt; are there any other ign. switch part #s out there i can try?
&gt;
&gt; thank you *very* much 'OldVolksHome' for the fishe info.
&gt;
&gt; i open to any other suggestions at this point! this has been a royal PITA.
&gt; thanks to anyone for replies/ideas. should i just maybe try to go with the
&gt; later year since it might be more readily available? if so, who has a late
&gt; model housing want to sell me one?!?!?!?!
