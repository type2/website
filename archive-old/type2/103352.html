Subject: 71 parts van for sale $500 San Diego

Hi all,renoir here in San Diego.


My 71 Wesy pop-top has to go. I have been keeping as a parts car; it is 
99percent complete with
only a few things missing. I don't think it will go make on the road, but 
one never knows, eh.


It has a siezed complete engine, with standard exhaust, and i think an 009 
dist.

The power brake booster looks practically new, steering box seems good, 
complete instrument cluster,
good tires on all four wheels, overiders on front bumper, glass is good, 
tranny seems good,
(that is why I bought it originally),
canvas in pop-top is excellent!!!!

Got to get it off the property, police are hounding me so I put in the 
paper starting this Thursday.

It is easily towable.Call me at 619-222-7374 or 619-224-8073, try both 
numbers.


Unfortunately, I am selling &quot;Monsier Vin&quot;. our daily driver, check out the 
site,

Thanks all
