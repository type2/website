Subject: Re: Not Type 2 Related but still VW

Well, really... Consumer Reports DO get their reliability information from actual owners. It's really not very accurate the way they take their ratings though.

That said, my wife has been a Volkswagen owner for a few years now. She bought a 2002 VW Jetta 1.8T (the 180hp version) back in late 2001. It was in the shop 23 times in less than 2 years. Everything you could imagine broke on it. The window regulators (nothing but a plastic clip), the battery died, the ignition coils failed, the check engine light kept coming on (multiple-cyl misfires). It finally got to the point where they actually had to significantlly de-tuned the fuel mapping for the ECM which greatly dropped the horsepower rating. (They flashed the ECM with the programming from the lesser of the Turbo 1.8T jettas offered that year). 

VWOA finally agreed to buy the car back, and they gave my wife an 04 VW Beetle Convertible for an additional $2,000 over and above the credit they gave her for the original full price of her Jetta.

The Beetle has been a pretty decent car really... it had it's own set of issues with the rear window regulators (on the convertibles), but other than that, it's been a much more solid car. 

I think VW had some major issues with their cars from early 1999 to early 2004. Since most consumer guides rate the reliability of vehicles on a 3-year basis, it's possible that the bad reliability ratings are still being affected by the early Taureg's. 


Hope that helps some...


Todd

&gt; 
&gt; Anyone out there own a Touareg? My wife told me that Consumer Reports gave it a pretty bad review for reliability, but I am more interested in the reviews from folks that actually own them and drive them.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ACTUAL owner reviews out there?
