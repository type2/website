I recently pulled a propane powered under floor warm air heater from a
crashed 81 diesel camper. It's a Trumatic 2800e and I got it  for 30 UK
quid (New price 730!!).  It has a thermostat and electronic ignition and I
have got it set up and working in my garage. It works very well and can
heat the garage in a few minutes. My question is..  can I legaly use this
thing on the road. The manufacurers web page says it can be used while
moving but I have always thought that propane tanks were supposed to be
shut off before driving.
If I am allowed I am tempted to plumb the air from my 'new' heater into my
redundant under floor air tube. What does anyone think.
