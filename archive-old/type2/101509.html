Subject: RE: [T2] BBB AZ Propane Q 

  Home Depot and all the Ameri Gas exchange stations no longer trade out old
bottles for new here in Havasu. I have had some older bottles still in date
filled with out a problem at a staion by the BBB site. I think they will
keep filling them till the date (on the bottle) expires, but don't quote me.
New bottles at Wally World or Home Depot are approx 23 dollars and propane
in Havasu is about 1.15 a gallon.

&gt; AZ Folks -
&gt; 
&gt; I have some 5-gallon propane tanks, one of which I was going to bring to
BBB 
&gt; for heat. These are &quot;older&quot; propane tanks without the new, California 
&gt; (only?) &quot;overfill prevention valves&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Does AZ have the same law that a propane tank must have the OPV for a 
&gt; propane dealer to fill the tank?
