Subject: Series Resistors versus Double Relays

From your experience, which would be the thing to go bad, the Series 
Resistor or the Double Relay.

RAtwell, in &quot;Double Relay Demistified&quot;, says bout the double relay, &quot;It's 
mounted below the series resistors [plural?? what goes...] that power the 
fuel injectors and two plugs connect to the bottom.&quot;

Reading this, and the electro-mechanical aspects of the Double Relay, I 
would expect to see a greater chance of failure [If you fry the relay . . .] 
of this series resistor.  What say you??
