Subject: Re: [T2] '73 fuel tank exhaust

good luck

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; In my '73, the fuel tank exhaust lines reconnect at the top of the engine
&gt; compartment just inside the rear hatch.  They reconnect in a rubber
&gt; T-section piece that then connects to an air filter.  Does anyone know where
&gt; I can find a replacement T-section?  Mine has rotted away and I can't seem
&gt; to find another anywhere.  I've tried catalogs and websites with no luck.
&gt; I'm also interested in the other connectors that are a part of the fuel tank
&gt; exhaust system, but the T-section is what I need the most.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Brian
&gt;
