&gt; Last question (for now), The 2 outlet at the bottom of
&gt; the fuel tank, Is the fuel pump and filter  connected
&gt; to the inlet that is pointing to the front of the bus
&gt; or the rear of the bus? I just want to get it right
&gt; before I fill up the gas tank.

??  the fuel pump and filter are connected to the outlet on the same side
of the bus as the pump (drivers side left hand drive) and the return is
the one on the passenger side in front of the presure regulator.
 looking from the top down the flow is counter clockwise from tank to
engine back to tank (anti clockwise to our UK friends)
