Subject: RE: [T2] Starter,Solenoid,Ignition??? (First post on T2)

IMHO not the right advice. Get the WR1 relay kit designed for this 7.95
from busdepot. The new relay could possibly have as high a current demand
as the one on the starter and not fix the problem. The WR1 comes with a
proper relay wiring and instructions.


&gt; Any Ford. Visit any flaps. You need one with two large lugs that were used
&gt; for the battery cables in a Ford and one little terminal for the wire that
&gt; connected to the key switch.
&gt;
&gt; Many also came with two little terminals. No harm done, leave the second
&gt; small terminal unconnected.
&gt;
&gt; Lawn Tractor relays are good.
&gt;
&gt; Motorcycle relays are good. I bought a Yamaha relay last week for $30 verus
&gt; the $120 for the Honda relay for my Honda motorcycle.
