Subject: Breaking in engine advice

If they stay on schedule, my new engine will be installed and I can pick my 
bus up on Friday. I want some advice on how to break it in. I only found one 
article at the Type 2 library. The shop doing the work is about 75 miles 
away. On my return trip, if I take the quickest and straightest route, it 
would be about 8-10 miles of stop and go city traffic, 55 miles of 
interstate, then about 7 miles of stop and go again. Should I just drive it 
normally? Should I drive normally but just not push it past 55 or so on the 
interstate? I also have the option of taking a longer route that's more rural 
which would allow me to take my time and go nice and slow. Is this needed? 
The mechanic told me I should drive it like I normally would, just be sure 
and do the oil changes on time  and make sure I have valves set at 600 miles. 
This approach seems too easy.
Looking forward to some responses.
