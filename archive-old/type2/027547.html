Heres the deal
I have a 1977 fuel injected 2.0 liter Deluxe Camper.  Upon maintanace of the 
vehicle, a friend and I found there to be no power eminating from cylinder 3 
and little comming from number 4.  We determined this by pulling the plug 
wires off the distributer cap.  Fearing the worst, a compression test was 
performed.  Compression is ok.  Then we checked to see if number 3 was 
getting a spark.  It was.  Therefore, we figured the fault had to lie with 
the fuel injection.  After pulling injector 3 off, we saw that it was 
spraying fuel.  The plug off of 3 had a small amount of carbon on it, but 
not what you would expect to see.  We determined that the cylinder was 
firing occasionally, depositing carbon and then washing it off with the fuel 
that wasnt burned.  I have only been getting about 10 miles to the gallon, 
so this seems to be a possible culprit.  I was planning on pulling off all 
four of my injectors and hooking the! m indiviually up to the fuel pump, 
running the injectors and measuring each amount of fuel to see if some are 
running rich.  Does any of this sound right?  Have we done anything wrong 
and where do I go from here?  I would appreciate any comments any of you 
might have.  Thanks in advance.
