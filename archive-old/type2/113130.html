Hey all,

I have always wondered why people have bothered to install these kinds
of locks or locking gas caps. It would be much easier for a criminal to
crawl under the bus, and cut the fuel line running to the fuel filter
then to try to siphon gas from the tank. (At least on my '77.) If they
wanted to be nice they could even use a screw driver to remove one of
the hose clamps on the filter, and then put it back when they where
done. What's more they don't have to start the siphon thanks to gravity.

I might understand it as a deterrent from people pouring something bad
into the gas tank because they hate you. If they are willing to go that
far it would be just as easy to do many other things much worse such as
damage a break line, or nick a fuel line at the firewall in the hopes it
will start a fire, wire a bomb to the starter, etc.

Now a locking engine lid I can understand. When I thought about the
number of parts worth more than $100 that I could remove in under a
minute I installed a locking engine lid.

Just my two cents.
