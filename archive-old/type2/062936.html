Subject: Brazilian buses...

     &gt;I've written to Brazilian importers of Beetles, and I din't think the 
     &gt;bus is being produced any more. Beetles can be imported and made 
     &gt;&quot;legal&quot; by pulling the ID from an old bug.
     &gt;--
     
     The Brazilian bus is still produced, but not with the coooool 
     23-window corner windows alas. Although they only stopped production 
     of the cool ones in the early 90's so there must be loads of them 
     around in Brazil. About the new one, well those Brazilians are now 
     producing bay windows, with slightly extended roofs and watercooled 
     rear engines apparently out of a golf (rabbit) or something similar. 
     They have a radiator mounted on the front panel. I've seen an official 
     flyer with one of these suckers on.
     
     If you want to check out the coooolest BrazBus check out the one on my 
     web server http://146.87.136.48/bays.htm
     
     Lee.
