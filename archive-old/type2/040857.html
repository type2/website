Thanks for the info fellas!  I think I'll switch over to pointless at my
next tune-up, if I can afford it then! Same old story... :)

I'm curious about your opinions about dual carbs.  The stock dual solex's I
have are working fine, but I've been jostled by odd whisperings and faint
rumors of the joys of new progressive carbs.  Thoughts, feelings, dirty
anecdotes?
