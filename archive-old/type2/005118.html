Bar oil is specifically a chain saw bar lubricant.
I buy it at the farm store, it is also available wherever chain saws
are sold or repaired. Sears, Home depot, the lumber yard, etc.
I pay around $8 for a gallon, and use it for it's original purpose.
It has about the viscosity of manual transmission gear oil.
To us this oil for an undercoat means annual treatment,
including power washing road dirt.

&gt;I wouldn't doubt that it's out there somewhere lurking at an oil field
&gt;supply, steel distributor or metal stamping plant.
&gt;I think I'd look for it at a farm and ranch supply, farmers lubricate a
&gt;lot of things others of us can't even name and the fact that it is touted
&gt;as a rust preventitive sort of makes me think it's used by farmers for
&gt;equipment that must store outside for extended time cycles.
