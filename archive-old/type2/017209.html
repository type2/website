Subject: WTB: Westy in KY

Hey, I've convinced a long time jealous friend that its time for him to
buy his own bus.  He's in and around the Lexington, KY area.  If you
have a bus or know of any in the area, let me know and I'll get the info
to him.  I'll start paying more attn. to the general posts as well.
Here's what he'll be looking for:

Westfalia or other camper conversion
Preferably a 78-79 with a 2.0 F.I. engine reliable for daily driving but
will consider others

Thanks In Advance!!!

Alabama Pete and Kate the '78 in Colorado
