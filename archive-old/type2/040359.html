Subject: When its hot its hot.

I thought air not blowen past the heater boxes would then be available to
pass the motor and extract heat from it on the way past?
So I have always checked heaters shut in hot conditions.
Different for watercooled motors who may appreciate the extra cooling of the
cabinheater and fan.
Omigod may be with heater shut the extra heat emanating from the &quot;uncooled&quot;
heater boxes will add to the engines troubles but then again...
