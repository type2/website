Mike, you gotta realize that you're asking 67 air-cooled hp to move a 3500lb+ 
vehicle. Kinda pushes the Laws of Physics to the breaking point! If you 
manage to pass the 20mpg threshold, you're just golden. I get 24mpg hiway( 
much modified ' 78 Westy Delux), and that's with a fresh eng, CDI ign. 
(w/Pertronix ignitor) Bosch plat. 4 tip plugs and some very expensive eng. 
work. (counter weighted crank, zero ballanced, 8.2-1 comp. ratio, tweaked 
heads, and a lot of trial and error FI experimentation. BTW, I've found that 
97hp/ 139ftlbs tourque is all you can safely build a stock displacement 2.0L 
eng. to. And I've spent a butt load of money finding that out...How many 
eng.'s now? 3, no 5...) Anyway don't sweat the mpg too muck. Just remember 
what you're asking you're eng. to do!
