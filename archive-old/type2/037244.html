Hey guys
                    I got great service on steel key cutting from
Steve Sandlin,
www.steveslockshop_dot_com  or by email at  ssandlin_at_LCC.NET .  The steel
key he cut for me works perfectly, the price was very reasonable, and
his turnaround time was quite quick.  I concur with Karl Bloss --
Highly recommended!
