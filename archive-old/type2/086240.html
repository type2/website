Subject: Re: [T2] Re:Slider sun roof

&gt;Come to think of it, anyone have experience with a
&gt;sunroof?  This one (1977) has the handle removed and
&gt;the seam siliconed shut - presumably because it
&gt;neither worked nor was leak free.
&gt;Joe

&gt;Mine is the same way. I am anxious to see the responses. If you figure 
&gt;anything out can you post it or let me know?

     My sunroof was caulked shut by the DPO with latex bathroom caulk.  I 
decided I would see if I could free it, and fix it.  After over a week of 
fighting with it (Gaining about three inches of caulk free sunroof), I 
stumbled on a product called &quot;Caulk Be Gone&quot; by DAP, it works pretty well 
but only on latex caulk.  Maybe there is something similar for silicone? It 
didn't make the removal trouble free, but it did soften the old hard caulk 
so it could be cut.  I then used a flat-headed screw driver that I ground to 
a somewhat sharp edge on one side of the blade to cut the caulk.  I inserted 
it in the gap between the sunroof and the body, and tapped the dull end with 
a hammer gently (but pretty hard) working it all the way around through the 
softened caulk.  If you keep the screwdriver at the right angle, it goes 
pretty smoothly.  To my surprise, the sunroof worked flawlessly!!  The drain 
tubes for the tray surrounding it had clogged and therefore the sunroof 
leaked, it was mechanically perfect though!  If you need a description of 
how to remove the sunroof from that point, I will write down what I did.

Hope that helps,
