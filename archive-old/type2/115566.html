Subject: Adaptor for AFM wire harness

I was doing some searching around on the archives and read about something
called the &quot;westy syndrome&quot; relating to VWs sputtering and stalling etc.. Then
it went on saying that there is some adaptor that is placed between the AFM
and it's harness. First, does anybody know what I am talking about? AND Do you
know where I can find this adaptor?
