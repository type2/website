Subject: Re: Looking into VWs/dreams/fantasy VW/bad husband

I must be the luckiest man in the world. My wife and kids point out every
bus they see. When I was recently sick and my wife was driving me back from
the doctor's office, she even detoured to drive around a nice little blue
'68/69. I was too sick to get out and oogle.

My kids look in every barn as we roadtrip, searching for the ultimate bus.
Of course, I've told my kids that whoever finds the nicest, oldest bus gets
to go to college. The others will go to trade school to learn welding and
body work. (Is that a strategy or what?)

And Ken can attest: my wife doesn't think I'm crazy. She considers this a
healthy outlet for creative genius.

Right Ken?

&gt;&gt;aah-ing? My kids are about ready to disown me and claim I am an
&gt;&gt;embarrassment to them.
&gt;
&gt;(?) That's what people put their busses in parking lots for, so we will
&gt;find them and talk to them.
&gt;
&gt;My kids act like that, I point out that hard work is a sure cure for
&gt;pretentiousness and they find themselves cleaning something.
