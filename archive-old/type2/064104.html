&gt; Hi ya'll, needless to say, I am from the south.  And I am very happy to make this groups aquaintance.
&gt; 
&gt; I have just joined this list and it looks like just what I need.  I was
&gt; doing the newsgroup thing and there were more questions than answers.  Not enough VW folks to go around.  Hopefully I will be one soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I have just aquired a 1970 VW BUS, for $35.00, I might add.  The
&gt; major problem with said bus is not the rust, but the fact that it has no
&gt; engine.  Which as most of you would agree, is something of a delimna, and
&gt; when your southern and no very little about VW's, that further compounds the
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, to top it all off, today my everyday car (the bus is a hobby)
&gt; decided to have a transmission tantrum.  In other words &quot;the damn thing
&gt; broke&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; So, here I sit in my underwear with very little money, a broken trans in a 93 mustang, and
&gt; a VW with no motor.  I would ask for donations but that would not be kosher.  Of course if anyone has an engine 1600 DP they would like to 
rid themselves of at
&gt; 
&gt; All in all, I would like to speak with some volksfolks in regards to rebuilding
&gt; the 1600 motor.  I am honestly thinking about pouring a few hundred (not many) into a
&gt; self done rebuild (with expert advice available of course) and just fix
&gt; the mustang when I can.
&gt; 
&gt; Come on wise ones of the VW world, gimme your opinions or advice.  I am a
&gt; country fellow living in Atlanta with no one to talk to about my options.
&gt; Feel sorry for me yet?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

&gt; 
&gt; PS:  I don't have much of anything left except the internet and my hair, and it's falling out pretty damned fast.

Cheer up, my southern compadre. If all you need is an engine, there is 
no cheaper car in the world. I've seen engines, in running condition, 
selling for $200-$300... and sometimes they come with a battered bug to 
boot. The same engine fits in the beetle, so there are quite a few 
around. A friend of mine at work had his son-in-law's engine rebuilt. 
The engine had been run w/o oil, and threw a rod through the block. 
Since the trade-in was unbuildable, the whole sheebang cost him $875, 
and included installation (it would have been $825 w/ a rebuildable 
core).

I'm willing to bet that there are a couple folks here that have a spare 
engine or two lying around. With a bit of luck, you'll find one w/ all 
the sheet metal still attached. 

One bit of advice. Be sure you seal the engine when you put it in. Lots 
of folks plop a VW engine into the chasis, but scrimp on the extra 
time/money needed to put the tin and seals back into place. Your van was 
designed to create a positive pressure in the engine compartment. This 
is extremely valuable in keeping the engine cool.
