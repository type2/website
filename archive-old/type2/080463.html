&gt; I've  studied how the rear trans mount on the 72 up type 2 is constructed, and I

?????  my 78 is &quot;Hung&quot; from a yoke at the rear of the tranny.  Two rather
beefy bolts are all that holds it up. pull the bolts and the weight is on
the tranny nose and rear moustace bar.   never had a bolt there fail but
it certainly is not in compression and if it broke it would not support
weight
