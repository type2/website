Subject: Carburator Overhaul

I am rebuilding a set over carbs for my '73 bus.  I am curious about what
to use to clean them.  Someone told me to buy carb cleaner in a gallon can
and soak the carb in it for 2 or 3 days.  I have easy access to gallons of
paint thinner, would this work just as well?  What about the brass
fixtures, does carb cleaner or thinner harm these?  Any suggestions or
wisdom.  
Also, I need a good carb kit.  I rebuilt my carbs last year with a kit
from Bus Depot.  These kits, although of good quality, have very few parts
and are made to work on several different carbs.  I want a high quality
overhaul kit, not just a gasket kit.  Any one know where I can get one for
32/34 PDSIT-2 dual carb from a '73?

thanks all
