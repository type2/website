Subject: Re: [VB] FW: Come join us at VWaddicts !


Grrrrr.

Admin contact for the site (and the presumed mastermind behind the spam) is
Mr. Jesus Rodriguez de Vera of Miami &lt;ssd_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;.

vwaddicts_dot_com is downstream from indyserv_dot_net, which has no functional web
page, and fictitious administrative contact information, and is listed in
several spam blacklists. Complain to &lt;abuse_at_verio_dot_com&gt; quoting the entire
spam INCLUDING FULL HEADERS or they can't help.

If anybody else got this I'd be interested in knowing; in particular, if
this spammer harvested addresses from the lists I will make it my mission in
life to staple him to the wall.

&gt; Anybody else get this spam?  I trimmed it down some so as to not provide
&gt; free advertising for them.  I like their disclaimer at the bottom.  I guess
&gt; they just don't understand that spam is unsolicited e-mail.
