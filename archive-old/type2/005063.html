Our 1970 Westfalia has the cutout in the rear hatch plywood panel, and the
inside latch knob is a plain round black knob.  Looks to be about 2/3 the
size of the dash knobs.

I'm pretty sure this is the original part

Our old 1968 Westfalia had no such knob, and no provision for installing
one.  What it did have was a simple brass barrel bolt at the lower left-hand
corner inside the hatch.  The mounting screws matched others in the Westy
interior, so I've always assumed the part was factory installed [by
Westfalia].  I have seen the same part on some other early bay Westfalias.

&gt;&gt;  Others in this thread have suggested the lever to unlock the hatch from
inside exists but is hidden by the paneling.  I suspect the original tug
knob was a plastic &quot;T&quot; affair which was easily broken and that restorations
by POH-folk merely covered the access.  &lt;&lt;
