Subject: Re: Clutch Rumbles

Hi volks,

&gt;This is on a '72 westy with a 2 liter
&gt; 
&gt; about 75% of the time when I am stopped and have the clutch pushed in,

 If you hold the clutch in when stopped the throwout 
bearing has to take the strain. It's not designed for this,
as VW expect you to put the car in neutral and let the 
clutch out again, and so it wears prematurely.
 Resting your foot on the clutch when in neutral can also
cause this problem.

&gt; after a few seconds, it begins to rumble. starts quiet and gets louder
&gt; and then quite then stops and repeats the sequence -

 Sounds like a worn throwout bearing to me.

&gt; History- Put in new clutch plate a couple months ago.  Didn't really
&gt; need it but the engine was out.

 Did you replace the T-O bearing? If so, perhaps it was a 
dud?

&gt; Not much to go on, but if anyone has any idea please share I'm baffled.

 Any other ideas?

Cheers,
        W.
