Subject: Re: [T2] *Closer to Brakes*

You need front brake shoes, not pads.
If one cylinder is leaking, remove the seals from
the rest of them and inspect for rust pitting.
Can you find rebuild kits for the OG cylinders?
Also a good time to repaint the backing plates.
Got rubber gloves? Wheel bearing grease?
Did you find the source of the grinding noise?
Drums not scored? Star adjusters good?

the replacement.  Anything else that I need to consider?
