Subject: Cost of owning a bus

Preventive maintenance is one of the best to keep machinery running a 
long time.  I have no idea how many miles are on my bus, the odometer 
rolls over too soon. Change the oil, tune it up and give it a good 
look over.

My '84 Nissan pickup has 260,000 miles on it and wifey drives it 
every day now that her Explorer was totaled 
(http://www.dronick_dot_com/wreck). My '72 Datsun pickup had over 500,000 
miles before I sold it about 9 years ago and I am pretty sure I 
spotted it driving down the road a few weeks ago.

&gt;But the best part is that I LOVE to drive the bus! Its just fun. Don't know
&gt;why, not even a clue. I just get this fun feeling when I drive. Leaning
&gt;forward resting my arms on the steering wheel tapping my fingers on the dash
&gt;to music from the radio. Maybe because I'm thinking of all the fun I'm gonna
&gt;have camping next summer in my bus. Maybe looking forward to when me and 5
&gt;co-workers pile in it to go to lunch and have a blast, such a simple
&gt;activity. I don't know, but its great fun. I can also carry large items in
&gt;it so I don't have to bug friends for their trucks all the time.

I too love my bus. I like sitting in the back and having a cup of 
coffee during class breaks. I like camping in it. I like the feel of 
the elements when driving it. It is fun to drive, not fast, but it is 
fun.

&gt;
&gt;I'm happy with the bus that I *own*. Any money I dump into it directly
&gt;improves it. Its fun to drive and more functional (for me at least). If I
&gt;had $15,000 or whatever to spend on a car, I would buy a cherry bus, not a
&gt;new car.

Good point.
