&gt;How to jack up &lt;snip&gt; tow a bus:

Be VERY careful when jacking up the rear according to this image...

You would be better off jacking at the reinforcement where the cross 
member &amp; outrigger meets the longitudinal frame member about 6 inches 
forward of where they are supporting it in the image.

Notice there are 2 small tubes an inch or two outboard of where they 
are lifting in the image...  those house the hand brake cable and the 
clutch cable.

A PO of my 68 jacked there &amp; bent the clutch cable housing which now 
puts too much pressure on the cable resulting in a very heavy clutch 
pedal action and I will have a hell of a time replacing the clutch 
cable when it breaks.
