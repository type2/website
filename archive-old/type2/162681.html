Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Suspension differences '74 vs '79

&gt; As far as I know there are no 74-79 differences. However, throughout
&gt; production two different rear torsion bars were available. A soft version -
&gt; mostly used on passenger vans - and a stiffer version for trucks and
&gt; delivery vans. Campers may have the stiff version, but I am not sure. You
&gt; could also order the stiffer version for delivery with regular vans. To find
&gt; out which one you have, check the M-codes of your bus: if it says something
&gt; like increased payload than you have the stiffer version. Alternatively,
&gt; take apart your rear suspension and check the color of our torsion bars. One
&gt; is green, the other is brown - but I am not sure which is which ...
&gt;
Brown is heavy duty. I have a set to replace the ones in my van but still
haven't gotten the &quot;ye olde round tuit&quot;
