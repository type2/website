&gt; &gt; would like anybody else's thoughts on Services Diversified.
&gt; 

I've been to Services Diversified in Zearing, IA about 4 times in the
past year. They were very helpful - let me go out in the yard and pull
my own parts - not many Vanagon parts, but I did find a front table with
support for my 81 Westy. They have alot of vehicles, but you have to
pick around quite a bit to find good specimens for parts, and IMHO, not
very many vehicles for restoration, unless you're up for a full bore.
        I've heard the going out of business rumors around here to. At the
beginning of the summer there were ads in the Des Moines classifieds
that the business was for sale- and another ad that everything must go
soon.
        They did a decent job fixing up a front end bash-in on my friends 62
Beetle but put the wrong hood on the front for the year (without the
crest).
        A fun place to look around though. They have many projects going on at
the same time. Standard Disclaimers from a four time consumer.
