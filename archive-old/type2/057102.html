Subject: 72-74 Clutch

List-
I am going to put a '74 1.8L engine in a '72 Bus which would normally have
a 1.7L engine. Since there are differences in clutch diameter and spring
pressure I want to be sure it will fit. Do I need to switch parts around of
will the 1.8L clutch/flywheel etc. fit on the '72 trans. as it is?
Thanks,
John I.
