Subject: [T2] Fitting Heat Exchangers to new heads?

&gt; I am getting ready to fit the heat exchangers to the AMC heads on my new
&gt; engine 2.0L type IV. Of course the holes on the old heat exchangers do
&gt; not line up with the studs on the new heads. Other than reaming out the
&gt; mounting holes in the heat exchangers, any other suggestions for dealing
&gt; with this problem?

Yes, mount the exchangers to the heads *without* reaming on the holes.  I'd
guess it's almost always possible to fit the exchangers to the head without
resorting to such drastic measures.  I know I've never yet had an exchanger
just &quot;slide&quot; on to a head.  You have to jiggle and tease; just *barely* get
one set of studs/holes started and then push/shove the other side on.  This
is a case where having someone to help would probably be beneficial, yet
I've managed to get probably a dozen or so heads on various engines
single-handed.
