Subject: Re: [T2] Serious &amp; Simple Vacuum Leak Findin

As a result of running out of gas, I DID find another vacuum leak (or
a prime location for a vacuum leak anyway) - at the bottom of the
elbow on the aux air regulator.  There was a split in the elbow that
may have been able to hold vacuum until I disturbed it but, no longer
for sure.  The soapy spray bottle technique would not have likely ever
found it as it was on the very bottom.  As odd as it it, I am lucky
that the fuel gauge is about a half a tank wrong or I wouldn't have
found it.  I thought I had it all sealed up but, assumed that I bumped
something.

Thanks for the smoke tip, though, I like my cancer sticks as well as
NO vacuum leaks.

take care,
ken
