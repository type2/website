Subject: Re: [T2] Plastic plugs (valance)

Naw - I think they were just holes for pop in plastic plugs like were found 
behind the front wheels.

They would be useful for flushing out the frame rails or oiling the frame 
rails down.

&gt;These holes threaded??  If so these are the holes where options you dont 
&gt;have got attached.  could be standard bus, commercial bus, or westy, or 
&gt;weekender.  sometimes vw is nice enough to put them in places where i find 
&gt;uses for them.  the one under my  bench seat came in handy for a wire 
&gt;entry location.  this would have mounted rear heat on the water cooled diesel.
