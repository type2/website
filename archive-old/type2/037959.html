Subject: Holy dashboard

I am planning to fit an Oil Temperature guage in my '70 camper - and so I
want to cut a circular hole in the dashboard.  (I wouldn't do this if it was
a good dashboard, but it already has a bigger hole hacked in it for a stereo
- not very good at all.)

Anyone, know the best way to do this ?  (I want a nice neat *Round* hole)
I'll also want to fit a lighter-socket in a similar manner.

Alternatively, has anyone got any better ideas of where/how to fit these
items ?
