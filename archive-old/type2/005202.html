&gt; Sean and Al your comments are interesting about the valve size but since
&gt; 79 to 83 heads have the same part No. how would one tell the difference
&gt; especially when shopping by mail
&gt; Greetings Karl

According to John Anderson's post on 5/22, the part #'s and heads are
different on a 79 bus and 80-93.5 Vanagons. Here is his post:

&gt; ''I have a handful of heads from various Type IV engines that I have
broken
&gt;down along the way. I read in my Bentley that some of the early Type IV
&gt;heads came with larger valves than the later heads (presumably along with
&gt;carbs vs. fuel injection).
&gt;
&gt;All other things constant - will the larger valve heads make more power
&gt;that the small valve heads with dual carbs (such as Dellorto 36mm)?
&gt;
&gt;All other things constant more power with a CIS injection conversion?
&gt;
&gt;With stock L-Jet fuel injection?

Well god said there would be 1700 heads with 39.3 x 33 valves, then he
said those weren't flowing as well as he liked and before he decided upon
sodium exhausts the 33s seemed to drop heads so for the 1800 there
were 41 x 34 valves.  However with the advent of that high tech L-jet stuff
to keep port velocity up he decided to step on back to tiny little 37.5 x
33.
But that was only temporary for in '79 he redesigned the head with square
exhaust ports and kept it 37.5 x 33 with an 029 pn (a rare head to see BTW)
but deciding L-jet was better than he first thought in '80 he went to 071 pn
heads bearing the good old 39.3 x 33 valves coming full circle back to the
size of the original 1700 head of ten years before.  Satan later bought the
tooling and started making heads in Spain and as I've afore mentioned they
mostly have 39.3 x 33 valves regardless of what they are to be put on.

What does all this mean, any of these heads runs just fine on stock
L-jet injection with darn near any size T4 engine.  The 1800 head may show
very modest improvements with stock L-jet but nothing you'd ever feel in the
seat of the pants.  If you got a 1800 set by all means use them.  The only
real stand out peformer is the 914 2.0 head with 42 x 35.5 valves but that
is
also due to reconfigured combustion chamber design, and that head is as
rare as proverbial whatever.  If you are running carbs and a warmed over
stock size engine however the 1800 or even larger sizes as long as they
are ported to match will show improvement.  Intake ports on 2.0 heads are
1-2mm larger diameter than 1700s and have little lead ins into the intake
guide to split the flow.  Bob Donalds will install the 1800 seats and
valves in
1700 or 2000 heads as will many other people, some will install the 914 2.0
size valves but the porting gets pricey.

Having said all this my opinions, use the nicest set you got irrespective of
what they are.  Those may likely end up a set of 1700 heads so have them
flycut for the larger barrels and go ahead and have 1800 seats and valves
installed.  Regardless use a perfect set without any critical or any if at
all
possible cracks and only very minor pitting or pounding in the chamber and
mating surface so it can be cut as little as possible.  The key to
performance
is displacement and there is only so much everything else will do within the
limits of keeping a bus reliable and cool running.  Carbs, an agressive cam,
flat top German pistons, and a CR in excess of 8.5:1 is a real nice choice
in
a 914, and depending on where you are and how long you want it to last,
maybe useable in a bus.

As I've said before if the sky is the limit, turn to FAT and get a set of
new
German 1700s worked over with the 2.0 914 valve sizes or larger.

FWIW when it comes time to rebuild for the '77 I'm using all German parts
with an NOS set of 1700s I picked up off ebay merely polished out but
keeping
German seats, German guides, etc.  I'm going to put em on top of a custom
95.6mm P&amp;C set I've had made (so the pistons aren't German) and I expect
a real nice combo for a bus that will run fine under L-jet.''
