&gt; People with lowered front ends on other vehicles have reported difficulty
&gt; getting up on ramps to perform inspections and maintenance. This is a
&gt; universal problem with modern cars that are already built with front
&gt; fairings low to the ground, such as a Mercedes E Class, etc.   Owners use
&gt; adaptations like long low slope heavy boards to get up onto portable
&gt; commercial ramps in their driveways.  One guy uses 2 x 4's.   Consider
&gt; being able to get your lowered vehicle up onto a portable ramp as  a factor
&gt; in &quot;how low can I go...&quot;

Funny you should say that...I was motivatin' over the road the other day
and was passed by a Honda with the Full-Tilt Boy Racer package...Lowered,
wiiide wheels with rubberband tires, enough scoops, dams, and wings to em-
barrass an F-16, and the obligatory 3 lb. coffee can exhaust...He was doin'
alright 'til he hit a dip in the road, bottomed out and proceeded to drive
over his own front air dam... ;-(
