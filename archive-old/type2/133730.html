Subject: RE: [T2] A Weber carb question...

Hey John Michael here, I don't know if this is correct but this is how it 
was on my engine:


****Anyway, what do you all do for connecting the accelerator cable ****


The accelerator cable connected to the adapter that was screwed on the 
linkage. The Sping went fom the linkage to the crankcase breater. The little 
black box has two 10mm bolts that is where the spring attached on the other 
side.


*****where is the idle adjustment screw on a Weber Progressive??*****

This site should give you all of the information on setting up the Weber.

I got the package by the way. Thanks again.

TravelOn,

Michael Knight
