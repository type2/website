Subject: update: stuck in chico

well the 1600SP engine got rebuilt in a driveway. the last engine had two
sets of rod bearings burn and toasted the rods enough so not to reuse.
everything else was salvaged.

i didn't take off so fast because i'm running hot. it appears the diz
drive shft is in backwierds, typical under stress rebuild. however it is
running. on a test run of about two miles. however, i found the apron,
generator, dipstick, generator -- basically all the metal was hotter than
hell. possibly not timed/advancing properly, i'm w/o dwell, timing
equipment at the moment. any advice what to look for? the dizzy drive gear
shouldn't affect it that much if i adjusted the valves correctly? chime in
now fellas.  - steve
