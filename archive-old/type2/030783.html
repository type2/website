&gt;will a 914/6 fit into a bus any easier then a 911?

The 911 I tried to put in my van wouldn't go through the door.  Probably
that Westy cabinet in the way.  

I suspect either one would be helped along by the use of a cutting torch,
but re-assembly upon delivery would be cumbersome.

I suggest renting a tow dolly.
