Subject: fuel neck rubber clogging fuel lines

Here's a crazy story for ya... You may want to check your fuel filler neck
after reading this! 


This summer, while travelling in my 79 Westy through Washington, I
experienced an intermittant loss of power.  Eventually, the problem became
constant and I couldn't get the bus over 50mph.  I suspected a fuel line
problem, maybe even gunk in the tank (the PO kept the bus sitting in a
garage for years.)

By some luck, I found a VW shop called &quot;Denny's&quot; nearby and asked for some
help.  Denny had an extra fuel filter, but that didn't do the trick.
After a few other checks and some discussion, Denny came to the conclusion
that there was something in the tank clogging the fuel lines.  He
suggessted that the tank be removed and cleaned!

Denny was kind enough to let me use his driveway and I was able to do the
work myself.  It took two days to do the entire job (what a royal PITA),
but here's what I found:

Once the tank was removed and allowed to dry, a big chunk of rubber fell
out.  It turns out that a piece of rubber eroded from the fuel filler
neck, fell into the tank, and once in a while it would settle to the
bottom and cover the holes leading to the fuel lines!  

This piece of rubber is the part of the filler neck that looks like a bird
beak (I'm assuming it prevents one from using the leaded gas nozzles).
The weird thing is, it looks like some PO actually replaced this filler
neck since it had the same &quot;bird beak&quot; which exactly matched what i found
in the tank. The part was badly eroded and looked like it was about to
fall into the tank as well!  Needless to say, I just cut the damned beak
off.

After I put the tank back, the problem disappeared.  I still keep the
chunk of rubber on the dash to illustrate my stories ;^)


Does anyone know exactly what this bird beak in the filler neck is for?
Whatever the reason, it ain't worth it!  If you got one, cut it off!
