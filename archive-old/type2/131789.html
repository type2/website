Subject: Hard Starts, Strange Idle - FIXED!

Hi Folks,

Well, as we all suspect when a 2.0 FI Bus is idling strange, it was a vacuum 
leak.  The hose from the S-hose to the Decel Valve had split at the end and 
was leaking, despite the fact that it was pushed on tightly.  A 99-cent hose 
clamp and 2 minutes later, my engine idles fine and starts just like it's 
supposed to.

Thanks to all who DIDN'T post -- I should have gotten this on my own if I 
had been more thorough in my checking.  Moral of the story: double-check ALL 
your vacuum hoses, even if you're &quot;sure&quot; they're all fine.

Best,

Hi

In my opinion, even if your timing is off it
would not be effecting the idle problem you're
having. The manual I have will do you a lot
of good in no time. Later
