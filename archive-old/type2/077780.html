Subject: New Engine for a 78 Westy

------=_NextPart_000_0747_01C196DB.4604ABC0
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I haven't done much with lists before, so I hope this is the right way =
to post a new topic.

I have a 78 Westy that I bought in the fall of 1977.  I picked it up at =
Bielefeld (I think that was it) and drove it in Europe for the next 3 =
years. I now have 160k on it, and don't really need it any more, but for =
sentimental reasons, I can't bring myself to part with it, so I've =
decided to restore it for use as a spare bedroom/toad with my motorhome. =
The engine runs, but it is tired and needs a bit of a tuneup. I've =
located a couple vendors on the net who will supply rebuilt engines a =
surprisingly reasonable prices in the neighborhood of eleven or twelve =
hundred bucks. I don't know what the cost will be after shipping.

My question is: what is the quality of these engines, or would it be =
worth my while to do the rebuild myself for some reason such as to =
insure the quality of the work? I haven't worked on VW engines much =
before (haven't needed to), but I am a fairly competent mechanic. I'm =
retired and spend most of my time rebuilding muscle cars in a vain =
attempt to remember the joys of my youth. I have a very complete shop =
that I built myself last summer (www.ohran_dot_com/eastshop), so rebuilding =
the engine myself would probably not be inconvenient. However, it the =
quality of the rebuilt engines available is adequate, then I'd probably =
rather spend my time on other projects. (BTW, has anyone ever seen a =
Pontiac 455 in one of these buses?  Ok, that a joke... don't anyone take =
me seriously). =20

So, to summarize... I am looking for reports from satisfied customers =
who have bought a rebuilt engine from some company. I would also =
appreciate any reports from unsatisfied customers, as well.=20
