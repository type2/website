Subject: re: new t/s switch

craig wrote
&gt; now, two things; one, notice that my spare switch (with broken
headlight wires) has MUCH shorter wires. The crimps appear to be
factory, so i'm not sure what's up with that!

craig, i'd say w/o doubt your NOS switch was made to fit 68 and 69 buses. in
those years wires ran directly from the switch to the front signals - no
connecters. i asked yogi berra about this and he said if you can cut dem and
make it work, it probably will.  if not i may have a spare 70 switch used.
