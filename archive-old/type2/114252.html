Subject: RE: [T2] Yokohama Y356D Tires

I've liked the tires so far.  I have driven in a driving rain at 65 mph for
over 100 miles and they were great.  I haven't had a chance to use them in
the snow, but so far everything has been most excellent.

&gt;I thought that I would give everyone
&gt;some feedback on how good they are.

How do they do in the rain???

I will seriously be considering a set next time.
