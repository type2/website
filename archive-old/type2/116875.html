Subject: bus stalls out, longish, please help...

Listees.

My 82 Westy has had a problem where when you come to a stop it dies since 
I've had it. First Alex helped me out and he concluded it wasn't a vacuum 
leak and he increased the idle, then it seemed to get worse and worse over 
time.

Then I had my mechanic take a look and he suspected AFM but I replaced the 
AFM with a spare (from Alex, thanks) and it sill had the same problem. Then 
he replaced an injector wiring harness thingy ? and it did really good for 
quite a while, and now it's back.

One thing tonight that I'm wondering is that the plug thingy for where you 
put the oil in had come out, and it's pretty torn up, would that cause a 
vacuum leak?

What else could it be, I have the idle set really high and it still does it. 
What questions do you have so we can troubleshoot this?

Please help, this is my daily driver right now and it gets really annoying 
and I don't have the money right now for a mechanic.

Thanks,
Daniel
