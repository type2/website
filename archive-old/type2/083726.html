&gt; &gt;   Robin and Peter stayed here (and visited Austin via Greyhound) while
&gt; &gt;their engine was rebuilt. A curious thing about his temp sending unit is
&gt; &gt;that is was mounted in the bypass valve instead of the usual sump or
&gt; &gt;dipstick location. I have never seen or heard of this location being
&gt; &gt;used. Comments? Anybody experienced this unit. VDO sender and gauge, but
&gt; &gt;the location seems strange. Wouldn't things be hotter there with all
&gt; &gt;that metal surrounding the passage rather than sending temp from the
&gt; &gt;middle of the oil in the sump?

I wonder how closely the surface of the sump or case follows the
temperature of the oil inside.  It seems to me that one could epoxy a
thermocouple to the ourside of the main oil gallery and get the
temperature of the oil without punching any holes.

Failing that, the oil gallery plug that faces aft on the engine looks like
a prime candidate for a temperature sensor.  I wonder why I've never seen
one there.
