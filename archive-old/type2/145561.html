Subject: electrical problem - HELP!

So I've been lurking on this list for a while..... but I think this is the first time I've ever posted.
  I'm having some sort of electrical problem with my '71 Westy. The  engine runs fine off of the generator, however, the battery is not  charging at all and nothing else electrical works (radio, headlights,  etc.... all dead). 
  My common sense would tell me that it is probably the voltage regulator  but I would like to get a second opinion and see if anyone else has ran  into this problem. 
  I have a spare regulator that I found under the seat shortly after I  bought the bus. Is there a way to test this regulator to see if it's  any good before I try to put it in?
  Also.... If I need to buy a new regulator... would be worth my time and  money to just convert to an alternator with an internal regulator?  (motorworks has the kit for around $150)
  
  Any input would be greatly appreciated.
  
  Thanks!
