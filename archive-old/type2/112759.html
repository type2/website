Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

Tom Young wrote:
 Your post uses the word &quot;resistance&quot; in a way that it's not clear
exactly
 what you're talking about.  There's the (mechanical) resistance of the
 spring to the opening of the air vane, and then there's the
(electrical)
 resistance of the strip inside the AFM to current flow, which
resistance is
 dependent on the position of the air vane and the corresponding point
of
 contact between the wiper arm and the track. 

I meant the actual electrical resistance of the distance between the
wiper at rest and when being moved by the vane.  Obviously how far it
moves is constantly being affected by the spring resistance.  Since it
moves further when tired, I'd think that a resistor placed either across
the ends or in series with the outlet wire Depends if more resistance
means more gas output)-would provide the same result as fiddling with
the spring?
