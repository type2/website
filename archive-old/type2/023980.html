This is very sad.  I know when the wife and I traveled 9000 miles around the 
US in '98 we were a little nervous about sleeping at rest stops, even the 
well lit busy ones. Sometimes we were so tired we couldn't help it, but them 
I'm a 40 year old 250 pound male, not a 25 year old lady alone.

I think more people traveling should take the little extra time to seek out a 
listee that can spare a spot in their driveway overnight for a little 
camping.  If I had stayed at someone's house I would not have wanted to 
bother them by using the shower or eating breakfast, this can be done at a 
camp or Burger King. I know I would have felt much better sleeping outside 
someone's house rather than at a rest stop.

If anyone is traveling through Fort Lauderdale, Florida and needs a safe 
place to sleep in their bus overnight they are more than welcome to my 
driveway. I'm sure I could supply a little 110 as well.  We all need to do 
our bit to try and prevent this from happening again. 

IMHO a 25 year old lady should not be traveling alone that far . . . .

Sadly,

Marty Roker,
Hollywood, Fl.
