Howdy,

I have a rear end tent made by Eureka.  It is made for SUV's, but works just 
fine on Lurch (I can't wait to get him back -- still getting a nose job).  I 
bought it at LL Bean when I was traveling through Maine (in Lurch) several 
years ago.  I think it was around $300.  I seem to remember seeing it in the 
Campmor catalog, too.  It is freestanding and attaches onto the back by way 
of a cowl (to keep out the weather).
