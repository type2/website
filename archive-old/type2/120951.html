Subject: Motor Size

Greetings,

What is the largest motor that will not over-heat in a 1971 Westy?  For
example, will a 2332 stay cool with an external oil cooler/fan combo?
How about a 2110?  Should I stay with 90.5mm cylinders?  I know the
92mm's are famous for running hot.  Are the 94mm's any better?  I want
something that will be reliable at 75mph and a freeway flyer
transmission.  I have been reading about the 1800 (78x85.5) bus in Hot
VW's which sounds like a nice setup but I think I should have something
larger with my heavy bus.  What motors have you run and how did they
hold up?  What is the best combination of gas mileage and power?

Thanks,

Doug
