Subject: re: [T2] rusty wheels

Hi Paul,

Take them to your local Cemetery Monument place and have 'em 
sandblasted. It's a cheap trip back to smooth bare metal. After that 
you can repaint with enamel (brush, spray or rattlecan) or have them 
powdercoated. You will need to remove the tires if you're 
powdercoating.

Note: Don't get paint or powdercoat on the contact surfaces of the 
wheel. These will heat up under stress and soften, which will loosen 
the wheel. If these areas are coated, be sure to sand them clean before 
re-installing the wheel.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; This is probably a basic question:

&gt; My wheels on my 72 are pretty rusted over.  Not in the sense that they 
&gt; are in
&gt; danger of falling apart but just &quot;surfaced&quot; over with a fine rust 
&gt; coating(nice
&gt; way of saying: gross)  Anyhow, what would be everybody's suggestion for
&gt; cleaning these things up for painting?
