Eddie,

Do you want ot mess around with this thing and have it come out on you or do
you want it fixed once and for all?  Pull the heads and insert case savers
all the way around.  You will NEVER have to worry about these studs pulling
out or loosening.

Eddie, You said bolt, I assume this is a double ended stud with one left
hand thread. In that case if the threads are intact, then you might be able
to get it back in this way.... Get 2 head nuds and put them on the top of
the stud together. then with 2 spanners hold the lower one and tighten the
topone. They bind together real tight. put the stud in and do it up using
the top nut to tension and use 2 spanners to separate the nuts, if there is
not enough exposed thread to use the 2 nuts you can cut one(or both) down
until its (they are) quite thin and it will all still work.

&gt; ..went to retourque the heads today and noticed that the lower right
&gt; stud on #2 was very loose....went to tighten but turning the bolt only
&gt; threaded the stud out of the case...along with little metal
&gt; filings....D'OH!!! The engine (1600DP Type 3) does not have case savers
&gt; installed. My question #1 is: what are my options? Should I install a case
&gt; saver on this stud, or get a bigger &quot;self-tapping&quot; stud? Question #2, do I
&gt; Have to tear the engine down to install the case saver?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Eddie
