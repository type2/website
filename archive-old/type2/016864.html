&gt; it's been really cold here lately.  I know I've whined a little already but it's true!
&gt; here's my latest problem, at -14 to 0* F the throttle has been taking 3-5 seconds to return, makes driving a little exciting sometimes.  I think the grease in the cable tube is gelling.  What techniques should I consider to clean that out and how much grease or other lubricant should really be in there?
&gt; thanks
&gt;

       Yeah I used to get that all the time in N. Minn. Also the clutch cable. I'd go out some morning to find both frozen solid. What happens is you drive thru puddles (we had a 2 mile dirt road maintained by yours truly with just all sorts of puddles ) and water gets in the housing the cable runs thru,
then later it freezes. I'd have to crawl under with a propane torch and thaw it out.
        The only solution is to pull the cables and grease them with silicon or teflon grease. If you can get one of those &quot;grease needles&quot; that they use to inject grease in a wheel bearing thru the seal, you might be able to pump the cable housing with teflon grease or silicon grease.
