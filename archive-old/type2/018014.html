   Heck, I ran my '73 for two years in Wisconsin with a Wever -- that's
majorally more cold than NC ever got even back in the Ice Age. I never
had a problem with my Weber icing up, even at 25 below zero. I always
warmed the engine up a bit before driving off tho, which probably made a
difference. I recall my '69 used to have problems with icing -- but I
never saw it on my Weber and the 2.0L it ran on. And there wasn't any
added on heat to the carb either. Of course, I was also running without
the engine seal and a good bit of the tin, so probably the engine
compartment was warmer.
