hi everybody!

I was wondering if anyone ever figured out what to
look for in barrel nuts to mount the spare tire on the front
backwards so that the hupcap could be mounted to cover up the ends.
I really like the way that looks, and was wondering after we discussed it 
the last time around if anyone got it figured out or not.

Thanks!
