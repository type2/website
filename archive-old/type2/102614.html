The RPM at which the torque is delivered makes a huge difference in what
you perceive as power.

As an example, I recently test-drove a Honda CRV and Element one right
after the other.  They have the same engine, but the CRV is tuned to
deliver its 162ft-lb of torque at 3600RPM.  The Element is tuned to
deliver 161ft-lb at 4500RPM.  The Element is slightly heavier (150 lb).

The CRV was noticably &quot;quicker&quot; than the Element.  Since the engine spends
most of its time in the 2000-4000RPM range, putting the torque peak there
means that there is more &quot;push&quot; available.  You can get greater power by
putting the torque at higher RPM, but then you must really spin the engine
to get it out.
