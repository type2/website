Subject: Re: [T2] Synthetic gear oil okay?

&gt; My main question is it okay to use Valvoline 80/90 synthetic gear oil?
&gt; What are GL#'s I see mentioned in the archive posts? Are there pros or
&gt; cons to synthetic gear oil?

I only use gl4 because I know it is correct.
Some of the synthetics may be ok (redline makes one specifically) some of
the later gl5-mt1 may be ok. But I dont really like maybe so I stick with
old gl4.

One thing. Make sure you can get the fill plug out before you pull the
drain plug.
