Subject: Thanks For the Welcome! (was Re: Just bought a '80 vanagon)

Hello All!
    I'd like to thank everyone who replied to my post.  Once again, it's a 
reminder (as if one were needed!) that VW people are the nicest folks there 
are.
    I've found a few faults with my new van, of course -- thanks to some 
&quot;fixing&quot; that the dealer did, without a complete understanding of Westy 
wiring...     
    The sink (pump) is wired to a new switch above the 120v outlet 
(convenient, eh? -- NOT!), and it only works when the engine is running.  
Also, the refrigerator doesn't work on 12 volt power.  You guessed it -- the 
sink is now hooked up to the fridge circuit, instead of the fridge!  Any tips 
on removing the icebox from the cabinet to get to the wiring?  
    The (aftermarket) tape player is hooked up incorrectly, too, but I have 
its owner's manual.  It's nice that removing the ashtray leaves a perfect 
access hole to the back of the radio.
    At least I have something to do this weekend...  :-)
