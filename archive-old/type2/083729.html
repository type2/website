Subject: cheap oil temp guage?

--=====================_889472414==_

hi all...i'm lookin to invest in an oil temp guage, now that my 1500mile west&gt;midwest summer travels are gettin ready to happen. i read in the library, the post about taken a digital candy/meat thermometer and riggin it up to your dipstick. but i've yet to find a thermometer in my small town that i can work with. i've also been reading through the archives, trying to find a post that i had read several weeks ago. where the person had mentioned a dipstick oil temp guage with an idiot warning light, that ran around 20$. but i can't seem to find this post again. 
if you have any ideas on how i can go about gettin a cheap oil temp reading, please share. i'd prefer not to spend the 50+$ for a HQ guage, but i guess that's actually pretty cheap compared to over heating, somewhere down the road. 
thanks for all the help, peace, -Chris 70'westie
