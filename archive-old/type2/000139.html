Subject: Bad regulator
Message-ID: &lt;0.b799f78d.25291817_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Dana and all..
- I had a bad regulator in my alternator- took me a time to realise that the 
bad regulator was causing a change in voltage and flickering headlights. 
Anyway, when I measured the voltage during the switching with a voltmeter, I 
could see the change - can't remember the figures but I think it was up to 16 
Volts. When I replaced the regulator, there was no immediate problem  and the 
electrics returned to normal. However, on my next trip, I travelled about 400 
miles, camped overnight and the battery was dead in the morning ( no 
overnight use of electrics). This was a surprise cos the battery was about a 
year old... well got a jump start and off again but when a refuelled some 50 
miles down the road, guess what-- exactly the same thing. Battery was dead. 
Got another start- this time from a tow from a local tractor and decided that 
the next time I stopped it would be to get another battery. So did that, and 
there were no further problems. When I reached my destination, I put the 
&quot;old&quot; battery on charge and left overnight. Next morning the voltage was 
around 10 volts, so there was the cause of the starting problem - 1 cell dead 
!!
--- I wondered whether the voltage surges from the dud regulator had caused 
the battery problem. Who knows ? ... just my experience. BTW - 2 years hence 
and no battery or regulator problems.
