Subject: Respirator use with beard

OK.... one last thing before ending the thread.

Beard owners might want to think about buying a pound of Crisco Shortening
and saturating the hair on their faces with it before putting a respirator
mask on. Crisco is hypoallergenic and nontoxic and it washes out easily
with soap and water in the shower. This thick stuff should allow a proper
seal between the face and the mask. Sure, it's messy, but it will allow a
good seal and is safe.
