Subject: So Cal body/paint shops

Hi there,

Anyone have any comments about either Convertible World in Signal Hill, 
California or ISP West in Carson, California?  I am getting estimates from 
each of them to restore my 72 bus.  Paint, some interior, seals, rust etc.  
They both seem OK, but just wanted to know if anyone has prior knowledge or 
experience with either of them.

thanks in advance,
Rob, 72 blue bus
