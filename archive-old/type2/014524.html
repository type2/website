My engine is almost identical.  My CHT never goes over 350 and I sometimes 
drive 70, but only with a tail wind.  Driving into the wind my CHT runs 
around 350, my limit, at 60 MPH.  
I'm running a 140 main jet.  Stock, I believe, is 125.
What CR are you running?  It's very important that you don't run over 8:1 and 
7.3:1 is probably optimum.
Do you have the engine compartment to engine seal installed?  And is it in 
good shape?  Where is the sender for your CHT gauge located?  Did you check 
the accuracy of your gauge before you installed it?  I've seen them as much 
as 50 degrees off both too hot and too cold.  Did you break your cam in 
properly?  (2500 RPM for the first 20 min.'s of operation) There has been a 
reformulation of engine oil in the last few years and it's causing lots of 
cams to go flat during the first few minutes of operation.  A flat cam will 
cause overheating.  You will need a dial indicator to check your cam.
There is a small almost square sheet metal piece that closes the big hole in 
the head fins between the cylinders.  Is this installed?  The rod that goes 
from the thermostat to the flaps goes through one.
Are your cooling flaps installed and operating correctly?
Do you have ALL of the sheet metal installed correctly, including the correct 
front (front of bus) piece?
That's all I can think of right now.  Good Luck

PS If at all possible use the stock distributor.  You will get better mileage 
and performance.  Set your timing at 33 to 35 degrees total advance.
