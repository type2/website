For those of you thinking about a Transvair...All three of you....
&lt;grin&gt; 
For those of you following my snail's pace saga of a Corvair transplant
into my '78 Westy while life keeps me busy, here's another chapter. 
http://corvairpitstop_dot_com/ 
I don't know them, never done business with them, don't know anyone who
has done business with them. 
I don't even suggest that you SHOULD do business with them, only that
you COULD. 
What I find interesting about their site is that they list WHOLE engines
for sale. That should give anyone who feels like the Corvair and their
parts are in short supply an idea of costs, and an idea of what any
engine you might find should sell for (should you find one locally). Why
pay $750 locally when you know you could buy one from an online vendor
for $500? Heck I bought a 110 HP engine and transaxle COMPLETE with
spare 1/2 engine, ALL the shop manuals from ALL the Corvair years for
$100. Made several great friends as well. They are out there and cheap. 
Update: dipped and cleaned Corvair carbs. Bought new harmonic balancer
from 
friend. Retrieved a pile of shop manuals (mentioned) above for all the
Corvair years and models. Brought my transaxle home from the family barn
for cleaning. Bolted flywheel, inspected pressure plate. Hopefully will
build carbs and clean and paint transaxle this weekend. 
See ya!
