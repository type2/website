Wow!!  back the hubcap dent up with some sand, and tap lightly around the 
dent!!

What a great idea!!

I have a significant dent at the bottom edge of my left rear wheel well.  I 
will fill a heavy sock with sand, and have my daughter hold it against the 
dent, on the outside, while I wail away with a hammer from the inside.

And if this doesn't work, we'll use dry ice  :^}
