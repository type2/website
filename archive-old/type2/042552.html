Subject: Re: Calculated CR's.  Excel Spreadsheet

I have a nifty little excel spreadsheet that will compute any variable
in the equation.
I cc'd my heads and then adjusted the shims to get the same CR on both
sides of the motor.

If you want it, pmail me and I'll send it right back at you.

Thanks!

Subject: Calculated CR's. Whats good??


&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; Installed the 26mm oil pump along with the Berg pressure relief full
&gt; flow cover.  I also took out the old 8mm studs and put in new ones.
&gt; The new studs were coated with case sealant and seem to go in
tighter.
&gt; The washers and nuts were also coated with sealant, so hopefully no
oil
&gt; leaks.
&gt; I was also able to measure deck height on all 4 cylinders yesterday.
&gt; #1   .053
&gt; #2   .051
&gt; #3   .047
&gt; #4   .049
&gt;
&gt; I used the tool with the heavy metal plate and screw and some dial
&gt; calipers.  Along with my chamber vol. of #1 (48.8 cc)
#2(48.9),#3(49.1)
&gt; #4(48.8) I computed CR at 8.00:1 (#1 &amp; #2)  and  8.1:1 (#3 &amp; #4).
&gt;
&gt; With .060 shims that comes out to a nice 7.1:1 all around.  I can
live
&gt; with that.  Anybody think it should be lower?  .080 shims would drop
it
&gt; to about 6.8:1.  .070 would be somewhere in between.
&gt;
&gt; I can get .060's on Monday,  anything else will have to be a special
&gt; order.  If I  go custom, maybe .080's on 3 &amp; 4 and .070's on 1 &amp; 2.
&gt;
&gt; By the way, my end play had a final measurement of .002 just .001
under
&gt; spec.  Is that cool??
&gt; Received some advice to use high temp silicone on the case to
cylinder
&gt; base surface.  Very thin bead.  Sounds right to me.
&gt; Well, the rest of today I'll work on the interior panels. Mine are
in
&gt; decent shape.  I was going to put some Thompsons on the backsides
and
&gt; clear urathane semigloss on the front.
&gt;
&gt; Have a great Sunday afternoon.
