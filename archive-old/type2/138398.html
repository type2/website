&gt; Obviously it's up to you. Personally, I'd let the guy put the starter

&gt; figured out the stupid half moon bolt..heh I didn't even have to jack
&gt; up the bus!) and then order the relay from BD. You get the best of
&gt; both worlds that way.

If it were me, I'd just clean up the terminals and install the relay.  
Go with the least expensive fix first.
