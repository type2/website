Forsman/Harris sends:

&gt; Listees will tell you to go with oil pressure, voltmeter, and oil temperature,
&gt; in that order, I'd guess.  Oil pressure especially is critical info to have,
&gt; and if the temp goes up, the pressure will go down.  A 16 year old boy will
&gt; want a tach, probably.  :  )

Also cylinder head temperature and a clock.

The clock's to tell him when to get off the road and find somewhere to
sleep. And NOT in a rest area!
