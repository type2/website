Subject: Re: Shipping parts from to UK to US?

Anyone know of a cheap way to ship crankcases from the UK to the US? I
found a new type IV case, but the cost of shipping UPS is half the cost
of the case.

Any ideas?

Regards,

Jeff-

You'll need to get the packed dimensions and weight, obviously.  My most 
recent international parcel went via BAX.  They had the best rates of anyone 
going from the US to Australia. $150 for a 49lb dimensional weight package. 
On the whole, shipping from the UK to the US is typically far cheaper than 
going down under, so you might get lucky with them.  UPS is usually my last 
choice for international shipments.
