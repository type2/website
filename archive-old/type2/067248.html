Subject: Anyone use TREMCO paint

Anybody have experiece with TREMCO (by BFGoodrich) paint products.
I need to repaint my uncles truck before winter (Dodge, late 80's,
profound, even Ford like paint failure) and am being lured by their
primers available at a local bargain surplus place that happens to
stock great quantities of new body work stuff.  Ever strong supporter
of PPG that I am, upon pricing DP40 (now DP40LF) I was aghast at about
$160 for a 1 gallon mix.  Thing is the Tremco 2K epoxy primer is
only $90 for paint and catalyst and they have an etching epoxy
primer/surfacer for only $75, plus both are 1:1 mixes meaning more 
coverage than the 2:1 Ditzler.  As the truck is bad now anyway and a 
work vehicle besides I'm figuring this is the perfect time to experiment 
with the cheaper stuff.  I will likely topcoat with hardened Delstar, 
tempting fate even further by mixing systems.  Same place also sells a 
&quot;Western automotive finishes&quot; acryllic and synthetic enamels but only 
have premixed colors and only have an appropriate color in the synthetic
which I will not do without a booth.  Any comments on this stuff is
also appreciated, the acryllic is really appealing compared to PPG,
about $35 the gallon paint, $10 reducer, $20 hardener.
I'm also admittedly behind the times with the new PPG systems, only
recently realizing you can't buy laquer no more.  My old enamel friends
are still there as well as the origional Delglo urethane I have used
for clearcoat but any comments on their new low end sytems are
appreciated, my boss uses the new high end stuff (NCT? maybe) and loves
it but we are talking like $800 in material alone to paint his vette,
a bit more than my average bus job.
