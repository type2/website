Talk with Bob Donalds of Boston Engine Exchange.
http://www.bostonengine_dot_com

I'm in CA (60 minutes from MSHP) and for the cost of local tax,
I shipped my heads back to Bob for work.  He did an impeccable job on
them.
Guarantee on dropped seats? hmmmm.....  I wonder if I smell a
contributing factor to the demise of a business?
Advertise something so much that everyone believes that it your seats
just don't drop.
Funny thing about guarantees.  In researching who was going to do my
engine, I believe the MSHP guarantee was in effect as long as the engine
was a stock beastie.  Any deviations and all bets were off.  Now, with
all the MSHP ads for larger than stock engines, how many of their
engines went out as stock?  I wanted larger valves in my head, nothing
more, but .... no longer stock.  Bob does all the right things to insure
dropped valve seats.

Like I said, Bob did some great work for me and I do not hesitate to
recommend him.  My '60 double cab is just as happy as a pig in slop with
that nice 2L in it.  When you talk to Bob, tell him Scott Fraser says
hello!

Good Luck,

Scott
