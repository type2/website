Subject: return of the newbie

well,
    i took my 73 standard all over texas to visit family this past week and
man did it run great... hauled down the highway maxing out at about 85 if i
wasnt paying attention and staying 75 comfortably and doing 65 on smaller 2
lanes in the sticks...  no overheating... but only about 17-18 mpg..... i
must have drove it 1500 miles last week. to dallas and back and to conroe
and then to san marcos.. it just floats down the road..
    only mechanical worry is the sticky solenoid as my tranny seems to be
working itself out nicely.. not much grinding or popping anymore!  can i buy
a new solenoid seperate from a starter?
    anyway... my window seals are a problem... underneath the vent wing
seals they are rusting pretty bad... to the point where the seals have
raised up off their tracks and no longer stay in... on the middle two im
thinking of bypassing the whole ordeal and putting in some louvered windows
&gt;from a junkyard(i guess i just cut out the vent wing support?).... but that
doesnt cover the drivers rear... could i retrofit a louvered window there
too?  HOW ARE LOUVERED WINDOWS ON THE HIGHWAY? LOUD? DO THEY WISTLE IF YOU
OPEN THEM? ARE THEY BETTER FOR THE PASSENGERS THAN VENT WINGS?  I was almost
thinking of doing them all the way around... i think itd be nice for
camping.. i could probably get them for 25 a piece....
    otherwise, im about to get it painted... any suggestions as to where i
should go? i have two small spots that need bondoing and the whole thing
needs to be sanded down pretty good... my buddy paid 400 to have his jeep
painted at maaco 4 yrs ago and it still looks great.... any wisdom to impart
on paint? its red-orange now, should i stick to that color or go with
something different(ie would it cost more to cover the insides of the engine
compartment, doors, etc..)
    oh and two of my cv boots are cracked.... ergh. how involved is that
going to be?

    im off to dallas next week to custom install a westy pop top on my
standard bus, lots of cutting and welding to come...im getting 3 window
canvas from bus depot and their seals too.... how dat?

thanks dudes.
ryan
