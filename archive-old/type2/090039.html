Subject: Aftermarket air filter on 74 dual solexes

I have the stock dual solexes on my bus. 
However, whatever is supposed to hold down the
air filter contraption is not on the carbs.  (I
assume it should be a hold down clamp.)  I
decided I'd better get something on the carbs to
keep the dirt out of my carbs and off the cyl
walls, so I bought a set of the aftermarket air
cleaners for single barrel carbs.  

This is a temporary setup until I can find a
stock system (or switch to dual ICT's maybe).  I
have no source locally for the needed parts.  (In
fact, I have never seen another late bus with
original FI or dual sollies--they have all had
progressive webers.)  To complete this setup, I
need help with three issues.  

First is the breather hose.  Where should I put
it?  

Second is that hose coming off the top of the
left carb.  It has a vacuum all the time.  If you
cap it off, the engine dies.  I don't have a clue
what it is, where it went in the stock setup, or
what I should do with it now.  

Third, there is large vent on the crankcase in
front right (front means front).  What do I do
with this?  

Surely you guyw with dual Webers have resolved at
least the first and third problem.
