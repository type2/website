Subject: Bus Depot baywindow sliding windows

Jeff, you said, &quot;I am actually working on a webpage with reviews too.&quot;

This sounds like a great idea to me.  I just trailered my 69 Bay to South 
Carolina, where it is now stored indoors.  Hope to get to a complete resto in 
the next coupla years, so knowing where to source window seals (and other items 
that suffer with the years) would be very useful.  Of course I read good things 
about Bus Depot as well.  Wish I had been paying attention to Ron's offer on 
jalousie window kits :-((

The best window seals I found were from Wolfsburg West. They are really good
quality, and worth the extra money.  I picked up a front windshield seal and
the complete kits for the louvered side windows. They went in like a glove
and they don't get hard and brittle in a few months like the cheapo seals. 

Over the last six months I have ordered a LOT of stuff from several online
vendors (I am actually working on a webpage with reviews too). I can tell
you, Wolfsburg West is my favorite - always ship quick, quality product, and
I have never had to send anything back. (The worst online vendor experience
goes to jbugs_dot_com - 6 weeks later jbugs shipped my order after I called the
credit card company).....
