There are articulated lever arms on the heater boxes, near where the
cables just hang out in space.  At the end of each lever farthest from
the heater box is a kind of cage-like arrangement.  A barrel nut just
like what connects your throttle cable to the carburetor fits in
there, and holds the heater cable in a similar manner.

It's a little awkward to connect this, because everything swivels
around.  Probably your best bet is to adjust the cables to the fully
closed position, pull on them firmly at the engine end to make sure
they're really as far out as they'll go, then attach them to the
levers such that there's just the least bit of tension.  That way,
when you go to turn on the heat, as soon as you start moving the
cables the flaps will start opening.
