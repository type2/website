Hi All,

I've got a 1980 Westy that has lap belts for the bench
seat.  Sonce rear passengers are not likely to hit
anything moving forward during a frontal crash
(assumes no table deployed in front), I think lap
belts would be OK.  The other crash problem likely
with VWs is rear end crashes.  For these you would
need a head rest to avoid whiplash.  Any ideas on how
to add a head rest to the bench seat?

Rob
