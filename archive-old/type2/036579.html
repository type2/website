along this note George....

I siezed an engine once (MY OWN).

Turns out the clutch adjustment was too tight. When this was coupled with a
HD pressure plate, the thrust bearing had no lubrication, and the crank and
flywheel grabbed the thrust main, and wasted the crank and the NEW $600
case.

A piece of advice, make sure your clutch isn't adjusted too tight. You may
get away with it, but you may not.

&gt; &gt; I recommend that you never keep your clutch pressed in for more than
15-30
&gt; &gt; seconds at a time. You are riding on your throwout bearing, and on your
&gt; &gt; needle bearings (that's why they fried). Run in neutral, foot off
clutch.
&gt;
&gt; Add to that the wear on the thrust bearing behind the flywheel.
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if the practice of starting the engine with the clutch depressed
&gt; accelerates the wear on the thrust bearing?  Seems like a bad thing to do
&gt; to preload a plain bearing with several hundred pounds of load, force what
&gt; residual lubricating oil there was from the bearing, and then run the
&gt; whole thing at low speed until the oil pressure finally comes up.
&gt;
&gt; Something to think about.
