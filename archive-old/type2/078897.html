&gt; If you want to IRC, the most common (of hundreds of available) clients
&gt; are:
&gt; 
&gt; for M$:     Mirc   (http://www.mirc_dot_com/)
&gt; for Mac:    Ircle  (http://www.ircle_dot_com/)
&gt; for Unix:   BitchX (http://www.bitchx_dot_org/)
&gt; 
&gt; Most unix shell accounts have irc present by default, I dunno about any of
&gt; the others... 

for Linux users you have a variety of choices, at least one is usually
included in every version of Linux

most operate in Xwindows, KDE, or Gnome

for Xwindows  try.  xirc
KED                 Kvic or Ksirc
Gnome               Irssi, X-Chat, yaggIRC

more info at http://xchat.linuxpower_dot_org

&gt; once you have a client installed, the server is irc.mit_dot_edu
&gt; and the channel to join is #buslist.  No one there now (and I am headed
&gt; for bed), but show up between 0100 and 0400 UCT and someone will be along
&gt; within 30 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; I am a bit of a techno-luddite (see the .sig :-)... still use a unix
&gt; shell, still read mail in pine, still have not gotten a virus/worm! I rest
&gt; my case :-)

amen, ! same here... and add in the sane operating system, Linux
