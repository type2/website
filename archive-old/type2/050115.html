Subject: [T2] 1972 Westfalia Paint Code

Hi Folks,

Glad to announce I am the new owner of a 1972 Westfalia.  Bought myself
a nice Christmas gift.  I am what has been refered to in other arenas as
a Newbie.  Was wondering if someone knows the paint codes for this
model.  It is a burnt orange.

Thanks
