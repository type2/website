Subject: Stockton/Tracey, CA area VW Parts?  30 Pict-3 in 1600DP?


A couple of quick questions:

First off:  Does anyone have a line on german 34 Pict-3/4 Carbs,
either rebuilt or new german-mad replacements, irregardless of cost?

I'm just interested in what's out there and at what cost, please P-Mail
me as appropriate.


Secondly:  Does anyone know where someone might be able to get a 
	german or spare 34-Pict 3/4 or a 30Pict-3 with an adaptor for
	the 34 PICT intake pedestal in the Stockton/Tracey/Sacremento, CA
	area on a sunday?  A loner would be *fine* and I could post it 
	back ASAP on Monday -- i just need to get home tomorrow.

Third:  What are people's experiences with 30 Pict-3's in 1600DPs
	and/or what jet size would you recommend (and where does one
	get new jets?)

Thanks,
	tom
