        The VW Transporter Anthem
        -------------------------

To the tune of 'On top of Old Smokey'


Chorus  VW Transporter, you are my Type2.
        My portable homestead, a room with a view

v1      Be it Aircooled or water, a split or a bay,
        a brick or a Euro, you can motor our way.

v2      What ever you run on, Diesel, Petrol or Gas,
        12 Volt or 6 volt, be it a Boy or a Lass.

Chorus

v3      Wherever you take me, I'll be yours through, &amp; through.
        From the borders of Scotland, even Kal-a-ma-zoo.

v4      From Devizes to Bromsgrove, to Portsmouth and Looe,
        be it Goring or Yorkshire, your my V-double-U.

Chorus

v5      We polish and spruce you, your carpets we beat,
        and fiddle with cables, in the hope of some heat.

v6      When you are gleaming, and look at your best,
        it's the high road to Malvern, to be seen at VANFEST.

Chorus

v7      The Judges annoy you, Pointing out rusty bits,
        Insulting your baby, will give you a fit.

v8      She's perfection in our eyes, so don't criticize,
        another use for this tent pole, could mat-er-ialize.

Chorus

v9      I admit her choke comes on, sometimes by itself,
        with her Toc H headlamps, she's a law to herself.

v10     Some colours are two-toned, and some are just plain,
        and some are so flashy, they give you eyestrain.

Chorus

v11     The Pop-Top is leaking, the rain's coming through,
        My sleeping bags soaking, but I love my Type 2.

v12     We've all had our problems, with good times and bad,
        but we've one thing in common, it's the best van we've had.

Chorus

v13     Oh before dawn has broken, and the hours are 'wee',
        There's a calling of nature that just had to be.

v14     Sliding doors love to echo, being true to Sod's Law,
        broadcasting your movements, to the whole camp and more.

Chorus

v15     When on your travells, and you see one like mine,
        if your're a true member, then give us the sign.

v16     If you think we're all crazy, to belong to this club,
        then why don't you join as and buy a V-DUB.

Chorus
Chorus

        Dub Dub Dub Dub Dub Dub, Dub Dub Dub Dub Dub 
        Dub Dub Dub Dub Dub Dub, with our V-Dub club
