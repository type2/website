Hi Jack,
I've had very good service from a K-D tool #730 thread chaser. This one has 
a chaser on each end, 14mm and 18mm. The great thing about it is that when 
you fit the 18mm end into the wheel lug end of the VW socket that comes with 
the vehicle tool kit (actually you carefully screw it into that socket and 
it cuts a very superficial 18mm thread that holds it firmly in the socket) 
then you have made a long-handled rigid 14mm thread chaser that is perfect 
for the long reach necessary to get to the threads on the spark plug holes 
on the VW engine, on the axis of the hole. One of the main hazards of a 
chaser is if you don't go in on axis you can take out all the threads, 
effectively.  K-D tools are sold at many serious FLAPS. Use as directed.
Roland
