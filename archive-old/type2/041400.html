Subject: 80 Vanagon Westfalia Aux. Battery

I am attempting to install an auxiliary battery using the Hella kit from Bus 
Depot. I was checking the existing wires in the compartment under the 
driver's seat in the compartment for the battery and need some help. The 
fused (red) wire is hot on the vehicle side as expected. The other wire is 
white on the camper side and blue on the vehicle side. The interesting thing 
is that when I checked the blue wire for ground it had continuity to ground 
with the ignition off but when the ignition was turned on, it disconnected 
from ground. I do not know the reason for it interrupting ground. The camper 
had power at all times off the vehicle battery prior to this project. I 
assumed (I know! ) that the non-fused wire would be ground. I can't trace 
this wire as it goes through a grommet in the compartment and is probably 
hidden by the gas tank underneath the vehicle. I have looked in Bentley and 
so far haven't been able to figure out their wiring diagrams. If someone 
knows these wires I would appreciate the advice. TIA
Dana
