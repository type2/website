I've been considering the Subaru as well.  I like the idea of building a
T4 to keep the VW-ness of it all but right now, nothing is definite.  In
order to get a 2L subby engine, I'd have to go the computer/FI route.  I
don't want to.  The biggest and simplest engine subby made was the 1800
pushrod engine.
