Environmental degradation??  What kind of environmental degradation do
you think manufacturing a NEW car for everyone every three years produces? 
How much more ore needs to be refined (or old metal re-smeltered), plastics
produced, and power/electricity generated, to manufacture and assemble a
NEW car.  How much pollution is generated by all of this?  Personally, I think
that keeping an old car on the road instead of buying a new one more than
makes up for slightly more fuel consumption, and slightly more exhaust
emissions.  Of ALL the pollution attributable to cars, only a little comes
out of 
the exhaust pipe!

Drive that bus with your head held high.
