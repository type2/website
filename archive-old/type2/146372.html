Subject: Re: [T2] runs now but won't idle

Time get out your multimeter and your Bentley and check every component of the EFI. Make sure it tests out good. By the time you finish you will be certain all is well and you won't need to take it back to the shop where they don't seem to be able to fix a VW. 

Also check you timing, check the timing advance, check the dwell, and check the idle speed per Bentley. 

None of this is hard but you will learn some valuable skills. 

1st rule of old cars is either you have to be rich or you have to learn to work on it yourself. Fortunately the VW is an easy critter to work on with normal tools. 

Also check the cold idle valve (make the engine run fast when it is cold). 

Lastly check the EGR valve for leakage (block it off if you have to) and replace all the injector seals and all the vacuum lines. ($25)

And unrelated topic: replace all those fuel lines asap.
