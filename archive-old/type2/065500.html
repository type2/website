Subject: Old heater box Reuseable? Anyone want (Md, DC, Northern 

After installing my Monza muffler (Thank you H. Steve) I realized it would
be a good idea to have a piece of sheet metal welded over where the
EGR valve connected.  So I took it to Peek Performance in Maryland
where I bought the Monza, and after the work was done they indicated
to me that my heater box front flange was ready to go and that they
would replace it if I would pay for it.  I figured what the heck and spent
my bonus I just recieved. Easy come easy go.  Before I pick my bus up
tonight I was wondering if any part of the old heater box would be of
use to a near by list member.  H. Steve you have seen this so your first
in line if it is of any use to you.  Also I need the piece of metal that
connects the metal housing over the heater box at the back near where
it connects to the muffler. It is a small 6 to 12 inch piece that is connected
by two bolts.  Please contact me soon (by 3:00pm) if the heater box is of
use because I'm picking my bus up tonight and don't want to haul the old
heater box back if it is crap.

Thank you
