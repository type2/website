&gt; Whole dumpster of other stuff, several fair bay heater boxes, and 
&gt; somewhat sadly about 50 T1, and T4 cranks, all greased carefully, in 
&gt; cloth wrapped around them, had been sitting in plastic containers, set 
&gt; out about two weeks ago, now all under water.

Such a sad story...

Still, I bet you you could clear $40-50/per on the heater boxes if you 
cared...

Speaking of VW places being auctioned: Does anyone know anything about the 
VW place just outside of Morgantown, WV on Route 119 (just before you hit 
Point Marion, PA)?

I stopped in there about 2.5 years ago to buy an alternator belt (I had 
shredded mine LITERALLY 3 miles previous and was running on a junky spare 
when I happened to pass an Air-cooled VW place in the middle of nowhere) 
but the place seems to have since closed and I was curious what (if 
anything) was going on with their parts/vehicle stash...
