Subject: Re: [T2] 78' Westy Fridge Question

&gt;The light
&gt;was still on and the coils were still hot but no go on the cold. I am
&gt;certain the unit has not been run in many years. Is it likely that it it
&gt;toast from sitting or does the amonia or what ever just take a day or so to
&gt;come back to life? I am sort of guessing the amonia is gone or this unit it
&gt;shot for some other reason, but besides the snipped wires in the relay area
&gt;everything looked pristine. Did not look like the coils had been messed
&gt;with and all the insulation was intact. Any ideas here???

Take the coil out, lay it flat and allow hot sun (hair dryer) to warm all 
of the coils. As it was explained to me (and as I remember it) by Karl - 
there is ammonia and paraffin inside the coils and the paraffin solidifies 
after years of non-use.

It is blocking flow someplace the heater element is not warming.

Mine has the exact same problem. I did get mine to flow without removing it 
from the cabinet and it did get COLD but then quit again - as I assume a 
blockage reoccurred.

So gently warm the whole coil - and you should be in business.

Question to the list: what about 200 degrees in the oven for a short while? 
Would it cause a pressure buildup and rupture?

These ammonia absorption refrigerators are pretty neat stuff and could be 
quite useful in a house in a larger scale if a heat source was easy (pilot 
light?). Would be a lot quieter and less power consumption I'd guess.

If you feel sure that your coil is junk and plan to toss it - could I pay 
you shipping to send it to me? I'd like to have a second one to play with...
