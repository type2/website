Subject: Bricks, Vandels, and a Clutch...

Listees,

For the first time with the 10 or so VWs I have owned I encountered body 
damage to one of my VWs while under my watch.

http://daniel.atiba_dot_com/pics/brickdamage.jpg

Some punk kids threw a brick against my poor helpless 82 Westy with orginal 
paint in good shape. People keep saying it's good they didn't get a window, 
but I wish they did get a window instead, that would be an easy cheap fix, 
now I have to figure out how to save my paint and such. What's the best 
thing to do with it now, I want to stop the orginal paint from flaking 
anymore. Can a body man pop this out or do I only have the bondo *shudders* 
option. My westy isn't pristine or anything but it's all orginal metal and 
paint and there are only 3 microscopic rust spots on the body.

Next, I'm going to have my mechanic fix my engine problems. (Yea I know I 
could do it myself but I don't really have the time or know how to drop a 
Type 4 engine and I'm a Type 1 sissy). First I'm going to do a compression 
check and hopefully that is good and then I'm going to replace the oil 
cooler, oil cooler seal, push rod tube seals, rear seal. What else can I do 
at the same time.

I think the clutch is on it's way out, the magical friction point is really 
high up, there's only maybe an inch left.  Is there any adjustment to the 
clutch? I know it's hydro and I've replace the clutch master cylinder last 
year. How do I know if the clutch is going out and does anyone have like a 
new clutch they never used they could sell me?

I really want to save the money up to fix everything it needs when I drop 
the engine even though I plan on selling it. I want to do it right and 
welcome any suggestions on what needs to be done. I really don't want to 
shell out bucks for rebuilt heads though if I don't have to.

Thanks so much in advance,

Daniel

PS: Thanks to all that helped with my injector questions, I will have them 
rebuilt as soon as I get the engine 100%.
