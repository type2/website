Subject: Camping Anyone?

 Hey Folks,
      There used to a VW bus camp out at Point Lookout State Park in =
southern Maryland. It was a LiMBO sponsored event, and I confirmed with =
LiMBO it is no longer being held. I'd like to try to revive it. It is a =
very nice camp ground, with some waterfront sites. There is a lot to =
do/see in the area, including a flea market, boat tours and more. If =
anyone is interested, follow the link below to my page, then follow the =
link at the bottom for more info. The dates are September 28, 29 &amp;30th. =
I understand this conflicts with a LiMBO event that weekend, but I =
figure there are folks like me that can't travel that far for a weekend =
event, and this is fairly close for those in the Washington, DC area. =
Email me if you have any questions. Thanks, hope to see you there! Jeff
