&gt; Not assuming at all  :)
&gt; Just going by the TITLE of his ad:
&gt; 914 Thermostat - $35 

And by the picture. I would assume he was selling what is shown in the
picture and simply used the same poor punctuation that most use in
advertisements. 

People have become accustomed to traditional print advertising over the
years. Limited space and word counts. Punctuation has gone away.
