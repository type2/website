	You've heard about this sad tale as it unfolded. I stored my '71 Camper w/1600SP for three weeks and when I started driving it again I couldn't come to a stop without stalling it. I checked the brake booster first and moved on to new points, condenser, cap and rotor. Changed the fuel and air filters. Adjusted the brakes. Adjusted the clutch. Pulled the carb and cleaned it out some. Topped up the gear oil. Killed a chicken on the roof at midnight on the full moon. Begged it. Cried. No change.
	Last weekend I faced my fear of carburetors. I pulled the 30/31 again and did a Q&amp;D (quick and dirty) rebuild. Removed each jet and blasted some gumout through it backwards and forwards a few times with the little straw. Same for the pathways for each jet. Replaced the accelerator pump diaphgram and the throttle positioner diaphgram. Replaced the float valve. Replaced the gaskets. Sprayed out all of the nooks and crannies, again with the little straw. That thing focuses some good pressure! Took off the choke (marked the position first) and cleaned it. All of it was cleaner when I was finished but nothing looked dirty enough to have been the problem. I put it back together with great trepidation. Fired it up. It takes some cranking to refill the float bowl but it started right up in time.
	No change. Still idled moderately badly and still died when I came to a stop. Life sucks.
	It occurred to me that I hadn't removed the airflow adjustment screws and blasted those pathways. I went to remove them and for a hoot tried resetting them first. Backed the big puppy out for the highest idle as per Bentley and the idle picked up and smoothed out. Backed it off a little from highest idle. Reset the idle at the little puppy. It sounded great. Took it for a spin. Problem gone.
	I set those puppies a year ago and it ran fine ever since. Why would they suddenly need resetting? It's kind of a pisser that I spent a month sweating this out when I could have fixed it wtih a screwdriver in the first five minutes. On the other hand, the beast now runs better than ever and we've spent some quality time together. It's a joy to be able to pull up to a stop sign with no need for the old Mario Andretti heel-toe action.
