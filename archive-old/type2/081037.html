Subject: Winter Campout Trip Report and Pictures

Hey Folks,
      Got back home around 4 PM from a winter bus campout in the =
Poconos-great trip! First, many thanks to Drew Allwein for putting it =
all together. Took Friday off from work, left around 1:00PM for the 250 =
mile drive, made pretty good time, got there around 5:30. Drew and a few =
other folks were already there. More buses rolled in through out Friday =
evening. Saturday, after a  breakfast of coffee and Tastycake pies =
(courtesy of Dave Parsons) some folks went off to ski while others went =
out to a flea market, auction, and just general sightseeing. I went for =
the latter, having awakened Saturday morning with a killer headache =
(maybe the Heinekins I had Friday night caused that?). We all got back =
to the campground around 4:00 PM to find many more folks had arrived.I =
forgot to get a total count, but I'm guessing 12-15 buses, plus one =
Corvair van! Had a good dinner Saturday night, talked with a few folks =
I'd met before, and met some new ones as well. Turned in around 10:00PM, =
with my trusty 1500 watt heater keeping my Westy VERY comfortable. Got =
up early this morning, more coffee, another Tastycake blueberry pie and =
conversation around the campfire. Packed up and headed out around 10:30, =
but missed a turn somewhere and ended up going home a different route =
than I had come-big mistake. Somehow I got on I-80 west, missed PA route =
33 down to I-78. I-80 cuts through the mountains, very steep =
upgrades/downgrades, 18 wheelers blowing past _at_75-80 MPH. Then I finally =
got to I-81 south to Harrisburg. It was no better, steep mountains all  =
the way. It wouldn't have been so bad except that it started to rain, =
and at times sounded like sleet coming down and was very windy as well. =
A white knuckle trip the whole way to Harrisburg-then it got very foggy =
and rained even harder. What a relief to pull into Leesburg, Virginia! =
My '77 Westy, which I named &quot;Alice Cooper&quot; when I bought her( &quot;Welcome =
to My Nightmare&quot;), performed flawlessly the entire trip. Never a =
hiccup,wheeze, sputter-it ran strong the whole way up and back. Hell, =
even the heat worked great! I just may have to drop the &quot;Cooper&quot; and =
just call her &quot;Alice&quot; from now on, she was no nightmare this trip. She =
better run this well on the way to Everybus 2002! Click on the link =
below to see the pictures I took- the link is at the bottom of the page. =
