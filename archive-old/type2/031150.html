As far as replacing the seals on the pop, you can cover them in silicon or
liquid nails. I live in sunny but yet very rainy south florida. After a
recent purchase of a 73 Campmobile I discovered the leak quickly. The
rubber seals that are under the washer should be word out... If you cover
all the bolts in the amazing silicon/ liquid nails that will help for a
short time fix.  But I suggest eventually replacing all the bolts and
rubber seals. (I hope you meant what I am talking about)

And as far as a good paint job.. I had several estimates and they are
all in the range of 1100 to 1500
