Subject: Re: [T2] trouble first engine pull

I was looking at ads in the paper once and thought a goog idea for a 
jack to remove vw engines would be a motorcycle jack like this craftsman 
(so many times when I see a motorcycle a vw takes it's place)-

http://www.motorcyclecruiser_dot_com/accessoriesandgear/craftsmanjack1/

maybe somebaody has already thought of this... if so speak up.  it makes 
sense though.  it has a wide base and stays low to the ground... you 
could even cart the sucker around on that thing.  it's four wheel 
casters would make it a little more stable than tranny or other jacks. 
 these also show up on certain online auctions.
