Subject: Re: [T2] 74 Rust Free Bus in CA for $80?

That's unfortunate that they're so strict over there. I wonder if the guy you were talking to was just trying to be all fancy pants and make himself sound cool. 

If it is true, then that kind of sucks for me. I went through all teh effort of drilling out the rivets on my original VIN plate, got rid of the old dash panel, got a new one from Busted Bus, sanded and painted it, and then attached my original vin plate to my new dash with regular rivets. But, that wasn't before I stripped the paint off the vin plate, and painted it a nice bright aluminum color.

&gt;I was told that it is illegal to tamper with a VIN
&gt;number in any way. They and only they can attach a VIN
&gt;number and if there is a question about what the VIN
&gt;number actually is, and the vehicle passes muster as
&gt;far as legality issues, they assign a generic VIN
&gt;number to the vehicle.
