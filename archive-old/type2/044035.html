Subject: [T2] Kewl Find 

While I was rummaging through the 68 Deluxe parts bus I noticed some sort of
mechanical contraption/hinge under the rear seat. Upon further searching I
found that this allows the rear seat and seatback to fold down into a bed
while the middle seat is in place. Is this common? I never have had a Deluxe
Bay, just Westies and Kombi's.
