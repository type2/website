Subject: Midvale, UT this Friday night ???

Hi Volks,

Apparently I will have some time to kill in Salt Lake City after work  
on Friday.  Anyone here able to get together for a brew and talk  
buses? Or recommend some other worthy past-time?

My course will be over around 4:30 PM and my flight is booked for  
10AM Saturday.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
