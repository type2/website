CC:ing this to List, if anyone else has any comments.

Glen, I assume that your 1500 is an upright? If so, I have no idea as I have
never worked on an upright. In the pancake, the crankshaft mounted fan moves
air for both engine cooling and passenger heating. Attachment to the heater
boxes is at the bottom of that fan shroud. So long as the flappers are
'open' lots of air rush forth, RPM dependent of course. The aux fan (mounted
ABOVE the pancake engine) has 2 flex tubes running thru the engine tin to
metal tubes to a port on top of the heater boxes, about 1-2 inches in front
of the main fan input. I don't use my aux fan much (doesn't do much except
at idle, no difference at speed), and have these tubes blocked where they
meet the engine tin. Otherwise you end up heating your engine compartment.
great.

The VW heating system seems far from perfect, as many have out outlined on
the list. There are too many discrepencies in the flow, small diameter tubes
running into large diameter one, running into small diameter ones, etc. Add
the total lack of stock insulation, and yer just blowing cold.

I sure any insulation you choose to use will probably help. I was SO hot
most of the weekend that I needed to crack a window. Outside temps were low
30's, and we were about 70 inside even at extended IDLE, w/o the AUX fan!
There is a lot more insulation I can do, and I expect to work on it all
winter.

Make sure whatever you use to insulate can hold up in high temps. If you get
all working right, I believe you will get temps off the heater boxes in the
upper 100's, maybe higher.

Good luck,
Chris

TNX. Ur just the guy i need to correspond with!
Is your heat propelled by the holes in the doghouse?
My plan is to tape those closed and use the aux
blowers to move the heating air. That way, when the
blowers are off, i shouldn't have anything moving the
heat.

I was going to wrap my ductwork in that alumized
bubble wrap stuff that they sell at Sutherlands. My
main goal is to get a little defrosting action, i
figured anything on the feet is icing--so to speek

Pictures would be great if you could email them.

 I guess
&gt; every little bit helps.
&gt;
&gt; I can pass on any pictures that might help.
&gt;
&gt; Off to camp in the cold mountains of Colorado. Wish
&gt; me luck!
