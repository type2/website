Subject: RE: [T2] Vehicle terminology

It's a fad of sorts....well maybe a permanent fad. OG paint, nice and faded 
and rusted up, lowered with rims, that sort of thing. Basically the older 
and more beat up looking the better.

Do a thesamba_dot_com gallery search on &quot;rat look&quot; and you'll see tons of 
examples.

&gt;Several months back I was surfing around and found an advertisement for an
&gt;early bay panel van that somebody with some very bad customizing sense had
&gt;tweaked and welded on.  They claimed that it was a good 'rat'.
