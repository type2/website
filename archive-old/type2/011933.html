X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Volks,
  A while ago I posted a problem I am haven with
my 74. Here is a reader's digest version of my post and
the responses. My thanks to all those who took the time to
respond. This gives me some start points to fixing
this thing! I may have missed a response or two. Not
intentional!

            Many Thanks! Dan_at_Seattle

My 74 dual carb bus has developed a interesting thing.
Now and then, after a mile or 2, it will produce a 
copious amount of white smoke for about 30 seconds then
quit
(smoking). It doesnt normally smoke (burn oil) and seems 
to
be running OK except for this little pop pop thing that
happens at idle now an then.
I did run some fuel system cleaner through it. The next day
was the first time it did this. It didnt do it for a week
then once again... etc etc It only does it (so far) pretty
soon after start up. I
have heard no &quot;funny&quot; noises before , during or after this
smoke screen occurs... scares the hell out of the people
behind me though! Any thoughts?

White smoke may indicate ingestion of brake fluid through
a leaky servo diaphragm.  Worth checking servo assistance
if you have
one fitted.  You should retain enough air for three or more
power assists
when the engine is off and you push the pedal immediately. 
If there are
less it could be the diaphragm.

Pop out the exhaust may be a leaking connection in the 
exhaust system. Excess fuel usually burns pretty black.

My guess is that brake fluid is getting into your intake 
through the vacuum line that is connected to your booster. 
I bet it happens 
when your bus is going uphill or accelerating hard (well,
*relatively* hard 
:-).  This is caused by a seal going out in the master
cylinder and the 
booster filling up with brake fluid - it's very common in
older vehicles.

Dan, I've got a suggestion for a rear bumper sticker:&quot;If 
you can read this, I'm going to flick a booger on your
windshield!&quot;. The 
front bumper sticker will remain&quot;Don't laugh, it could be
your daughter!&quot;.

White smoke is, rule of thumb, excess raw fuel. If your 
carburated, look for a sunken float or stuck float valve or
a jet that has 
come loose. If your fuel injected, look for leaking
injectors. Pull a 
spark plug. Heavy carbon or wetness will confirm. Also
check for a sticking 
choke on carbs. That's just a guess from the info given. Do
submit to the 
list for other ideas.
