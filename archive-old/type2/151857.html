Subject: Re: [T2] who sells the cheapest TMI headliner

Richard,

Not so on my 78 CE restore, unlike my headliner, the panels all seemed to 
go on prefectly.

The holes for the retaining nuts on the door panels were a little small, 
but worked ok.

I had to do cut out for the ash tray in the back tho.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Actually Richard, my TMI interior for my 70 bug went on flawlessly  
&gt; &gt; and looks
&gt; &gt; great!! I didn't even use the Hog Ring plier kit that I bought, it  
&gt; &gt; fit so
&gt; &gt; well and snug that it wasn't needed. I can send you pics if you'd  
&gt; &gt; like.
&gt; 
&gt; I always hear complaints about the fit of TMI panels for bus interiors.
