Subject: RE: wiring question

&gt;under the main cupboard under the sink, a wire had been cut. It's a main
wire that
&gt;runs from the fuse box, under the front carpets, through the drivers seat,
&gt;and out through the back and underneath the cupboard. The wire was just cut
&gt;and hanging there,

I had the same thing in my bus, after some research I found that it was
connected to the fuse box in a location called the &quot;Aux Heater Circuit.&quot;
(even though it wasn't connected to my BN4) I think I found this out via the
Bentley or Haynes manual...  I removed the wire from the spade connector on
the back of the fuse box and just took it out of my bus.
