Subject: Re: [T2] A-Arm Bushing Replacement???




&gt;Has anyone replaced the A-Arm bushing before?  I assume they press in?
&gt;I'm looking for a way to get the old out and the new ones in without
&gt;having to take them to a shop to be pressed out and new in.
&gt;
&gt;Dave

Dave,
	I take it you mean the front beam/control arm bushings?  Are these things 
even available anymore?  I thought I saw a note on a retailers' site that 
they were NLA.  If you find a source for them, please let us all know.  
Thanks.
