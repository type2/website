Subject: Fuel sender - gas tank seal?

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone knew where I could get the fuel sender seal/gasket
for my '68? I'd like to clean out the gas tank and maybe treat it but all I
see available are seals for the later busses!  Can anyone tell me about
these seals? I would think it would need to be replaced, no?

Thanks,
Jen :-)
