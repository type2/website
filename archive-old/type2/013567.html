I might make mention of this also. Get a Bentley or Hayes that covers all
years of your particular van series. Chances are that you're the third or
fourth owner and I'd suspect that your van has parts from both earlier
and later model vans. I've run across a lot of engines that are either
pre or post the year model of the van they're living on. This will be a
big help in securing interchangeable parts and keeping your van operating
economically.
I've found that my 83 Aircooled has the potential of about six different
transmissions and four or five oil-pumps.
