Subject: HCBF Pot Luck and Wing Cookoff...

--part1_fe.1b169ee8.2a6dfd9c_boundary

High Country Bus Fest is THIS WEEKEND!!!  I just wanted to remind everyone of 
the Pot Luck Dinner and Wing Cookoff that we will be having Saturday night. 
So fix up your winning recipie wings and try to knock the judges' socks off! 
Make 'em hot, make 'em not, just make 'em and make 'em good!! 

For the Pot Luck, please bring any dish or bring any dish that will 
compliment the wings  - celery, chips, bread, veggies, etc. There will be a 
lot of people so we'll all need to pitch in to feed the masses.

I still need one more judge to step up to the plate and help out! P-mail me 
if you are interested.
