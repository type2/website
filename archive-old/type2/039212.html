Subject: re:110 city power and new ?

A big thank you to all of you who responded to my 110 outlet problems.  
System seems to be working fine and now the fridge just may keep those
beverages cold.  I still haven't gotten around to testing out that propane
stove but it's nice to know that there is no power needed for that system to
run properly.
My new question (sorry about the newbie questions):
On my way to work tonight the rear end of the bus started making a horrible
grinding/and cranking noise as I turn corners and drive down hills.  I
suspected CV joints as it was probably time to have those repacked anyway
but after some minimal inspection (during my 15 smoke break) and consulting
Muir, their doesn't seem to be any unusual play in the driveshaft/cv boot
area.  I have eliminated the possibility that the engine or tranny is
causing this noise because it seems to idle just fine and the transmission
still appears to be shifting smoothly.  It could be a brake issue but I
don't know because it is raining and I just don't have the time (or the
tools) while I'm at work to check it out closely.  I would like to check the
archives but at this point I don't even know what I would be looking for.
if any one could just point me in the right direction this would be greatly
appreciated.  I intend to drive this bus to Alaska in two weeks granted it
is in ship shape and ready for the extreme driving conditions but I would
hope this isn't a huge set back.  Thank you sooooo much in advance.  This
list is one of a bus owners greatest assets.   (I just hope I don't drive
you all nuts and get kicked off for asking stupid questions.)
Thanks again,
Dave
