&lt;&lt; Makes since. I have seen many a split bus gas flap bent by a thief who was

to dumb to know he could stick his screw driver in the &quot;key hole&quot; and open

it a lot more easily than he could rip the flap back. They aren't apposed to

doing body damage to your vehicle.

No they're not...Years ago I had a K-G convertible and drove it and parked it 
a lot in NYC. I fabbed a removable radio for it and left it unlocked with 
noth-
ing in it when parked. Some thief ripped the sh*t out of the top to get to
the inside handle of the unlocked door...
