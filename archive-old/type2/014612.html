Don't you bypass the rheostat by rotating the knob fully clockwise or
counter clockwise?  If that doesn't work, just power the dash lights
from the parking lights terminal.  Should work for 68 and later buses.

By the way,  has anybody ever had the problem of having dashboard
lights that were too bright?  Can't say that it ever happened in
either of my 71 buses.

&gt;the secret to these suckers is just ripping out the rheostat, and 
&gt;bridging
&gt;the circuit with a resistor... i can't remember what value my 
&gt;electronics
&gt;friend used, but it gave a brightness roughly halfway between off 
&gt;and full.
&gt;not adjustable, of course, but you could try different resistors 
&gt;till you
&gt;find a brightness you like.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;i took 4 switches apart to make 1 working one, rheostat and all. 
&gt;when it
&gt;goes, i put in another resistor :P
