Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

Oh,
I just remembered that on a couple of engines I took in that had dual
diaphram distributors, that's where the intake manifold vacum port went to.
Also, the Bosch SVDA distributor uses that port on the DP 34 PICT-3 center
sections on the 71 Bus., I know, I had one on my old 71 westy which I wish I
had never sold.

Hey Doc Ric,
in answer to your question on type one 1500 vacume ports, I have several
single port intakes on the shelf with and without vacume ports. Since I do
engines mostly, I couldn't tell you what years or types of cars these came
from. Most applications, I just dead end the vacume port on the intake if
there is one on the carb. Maybe Eric and Barb know where the intended place
the intake manifold vacume port was designed to go.

Ric (and the rest of you, too :),

I am (until my forehead colides with the keyboard from exhaustion :)
going to try to cover &quot;lessons learned&quot; for three of the four buses I
worked on at everybus, starting with Ric's.  Won't cover bus #2 because
(a) it needed nothing and (b) I forget whose van it was :-)

Ric's bus was bus #1.  It is a 68-70 bus with a type1 engine, ?1600? SP,
no disc brakes.  Ric has just rebuilt the engine and it is running hot, by
his standards (and mine) as he describes in his post.

When I opened the engine compartment I wanted to check three things,
dwell, timing, and vacuum.  His dwell was not spot on, but was well within
adjustment limits (my standards are 45-55 degrees dwell for a type1 engine
and 48-52 for a type4 engine)  His was ~53 and fine.

His destributor was a single vacuum advance with mechanical advance,
source unknown.  His timing...  When I first looked at it, it was 15
degrees BTDC, advancing to 44 BTDC at ~2500-3000.  IMNSHO, this is *WAY*
too advanced!!! I reset it to 7.5 BTDC, which brought his max advance down
to ~38 BTDC.  I was still not too happy, because I don't like to see a T1
engine advancing to more than 35 degrees.  I went over to Jamie Rivewrs
and did a bit of a consult with him and he was strong on 30 degrees max
advance.  I left it as it was, tho I tend to agree with Jamie (plus he
knows a heck of a lot more about T1 than I do!)

When I went to check the vacuum, I made an amazing discovery!  As far as I
can tell, on an early single port manifold, there is *noplace* to check
manifold vacuum!!!!  Am I wrong?????  Did I miss a port on the front of
the dist????

Anyhow, I followed Ric and Chris Slaymaker home to Rics place...  His bus
was still running hot :-(  So at one of the gas breaks, I dropped his
timing another notch to a max advance of 33 degrees, which put his initial
advance at 3 BTDC.  I knew he would have idle problems there, but I wanted
to see if the engine temps dropped.  No good, no drop :-(

At this point, I am stumped.  The only thing I can think of is that his
mix is lean either becasue of (a) a vacuum leak I could not check for
becasue of the lack of a port or (b) a clogged or too small main jet.

My suggestion to him is that he take it to a shop and ask them to plug in
an EGA and see what his mixture was.

On what dist he has.... I should have pulled it out and had a look, but
didn't (my bad), but I believe that he has a distributor for a '76-79 bus
on there, because of the combination vacuum/mechanical advance and becasue
of the range.  A 30/1 degree advance range is simply too much for a T1
motor, and I believe Ric has the opposite of the 009 &quot;not enough advance&quot;
problem with his current distributor.  As an amusing side note, we walked
around a bit to find a T1 with a vacuum advance dist, and FAILED!!!!  We
checked ~10 busses and every one of them had an 009!!!!

I would dearly love to hear any comments on what I did wrong/could have
done in addition to what I did.  I am a bit upset at failing to correct
Ric's problem :-(

&gt; The Big Question: What makes a distributor correct for a certain year? Is
it
&gt; the case? Is it the number of ports? Is it the crank? What changes on the
&gt; 1600 engine occurred over the years to require a different distributor???
&gt;
&gt; History:
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the help at Everybus to everyone that had input on my hot
engine
&gt; problem. The ride there was long as I could not go over 50 mph and keep
the
&gt; oil temp (VDO dip stick sender) below 250 degrees. I radioed the
carabussers
&gt; and told them to pass me, but my buddies from the TN Mechanized and my
best
&gt; friend Chris Slaymaker refused to leave me.
&gt;
&gt; One initial comment: If you ask 20 bus owners about oil temp reading, you
&gt; will get 20 different answers. I had one guy nervous about his high
&gt; temperature getting to 190 and one guy with worlds more VW experience than
&gt; me running at 280 and not concerned in the least.  My gut tells me to cool
&gt; off at 240, but I had just put in 20-50 synthetic so I figured I would not
&gt; go past 250 and stay safe.
&gt;
&gt; I had retarded the timing a bit with no help and no power so I advanced
the
&gt; timing just before the trip. I had much better power, and stayed at
&gt; comfortable temps in the mountains, but the Interstate driving nearly
killed
&gt; me (literally as if that outraged redneck truck driver had had a gun, I
&gt; would have been shot for slowing him down- another story for another day).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, Steve Dolan putzed with the timing at EB and said it was too far
&gt; advanced, and anyway, that was the wrong distributor for that year. He
&gt; retarded it a bit but that did not help and did lead to a loss of power
&gt; coming back of the mountain.
&gt;
&gt; I ask The Big Question because this engine is a bit of a Frankenstein as I
&gt; built it on the case from the 71 DP. The case was stamped &quot;Mexico&quot; so all
I
&gt; know is that it was in the bus when I bought it in 1983. It was DP when I
&gt; tore it down, but I put on SP heads. The crank was also from the 71, but I
&gt; have no idea if it was the original one. So when I look at distributor
&gt; charts, what year engine do I have?
&gt;
&gt; Dolan was right. I found out today that this distributor is from a 1972 MT
&gt; Beetle, and as confused as I am, I am sure I do not have one of those. :-)
&gt;
&gt; I have four distributors in front of me and none look close to what I
need.
&gt; Dolan and I went butt sniffing (engine lid lifting) at EB, and found all
the
&gt; early bays that we looked at were running 009s. I have one of those but a
&gt; friend was messing with it and broke the return spring. We found a spring
&gt; that would fit, but I assume that it is important to put the exactly
correct
&gt; one back in for it to advance correctly. How can I get this one fixed?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to all for any input.
&gt;
&gt; PS: One good thing happened. Many listened to the engine and thought it
&gt; sounded great. I guess the vibration thing is not as bad a I perceived it
to
&gt; be.
