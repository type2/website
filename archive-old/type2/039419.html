Subject: New rear brakes - update

I re-adjusted my new brakes this weekend after about 200 miles of running.
SO EASY when they are new and not seized up :-).  They must have bedded in
well because I was able to turn each adjuster 4-5 clicks more before the
drums lock than when I first put the brakes on.  It makes a LOT of
difference to have them adjusted properly - I didn't think the rear brakes
had as much effect on braking.  And I won't roll back on hills either.  Next
job on the list - change tranny oil :( (I will make sure to get GL4 spec).
