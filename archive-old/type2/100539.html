Subject: dizzy questions

I have 2 quick questions.
1.  I need a replacement distributor for my 1970 Westy.  It has a stock 1600 
with a
Solex 30/31 Carb.  The original dizzy is a 205T vaccum advance.  I know 
Philbin rebuilders
in Portland and Aircooled_dot_net have replacement units.  Are there others that 
do good work?

2.  I have been loaned a near new 009 until I can find a vaccum advance 
dizzy.  I know
about the problems with these, but I need to drive my bus for the next few 
weeks.  It is a
very temporary thing.  Can someone tell me where to time my engine with the 
009?
The 205T was at 0 degrees tdc.  I've seen 7 1/2 and 10 degrees btdc 
mentioned.  I drive freeways
and city streets.  Advice and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
