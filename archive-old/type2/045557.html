Karl kindly pointed out that I forgot to mention the distributor:-)

I *will* need that too!!!
It is a dual vacuum type. Karl also offered another addendum to the wish 
list, see below:

&gt;Try to get the distributor and harness from the same vehicle. The 3 wire
&gt;plug and plug socket on the dist. comes in 2 versions. The guide lug is
&gt;different between the 2 and they won't go together if mismatched.

TIA and cheers/Don Carron
