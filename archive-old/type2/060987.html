&gt;Hi Volks!
can't find my engine # anywhere.I think it may be a bug engine, can anyone
help?
&gt;engine # AH216757
I have an almost identical engine about to get rebuilt for the Turtle.  I
think I got this info from the Muir book (gotta have it).  It's a 1600 DP
from 1974 for Type 1, with emission controls.  Look at the top of the
flywheel housing (engine out). You will see the never mentioned (except by
Clymer manuals) TDC sensor, a little button with a wire coming out, a 1974
only pre FI weirdness.  Hope that helps.
