Subject: type 1 and type 4 oil pumps

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I got an E-mail from listee Jeff Martin, he had run across a old post from
Bob Hoover, in this message he stated in passing that the oil pumps from a
type 1 motor will fit into a type 4 motor. He said this due to the fact that
the t4 pumps are very expensive and the t1's are cheap. He said to use the
t1 high volume type. I pondered this for a while and could not wait to get
home, where I have both a t1 and t4 apart. I pulled the t1 pump out and test
fit it into the t4, sure enough it fit. All holes lined up, studs are right,
the depth was right on, the center line of the drive shaft was right on. So
I took the type 4 pump and put it into a type 1 case half with a cam in it
to see how it fit. Everything was right on here too. I took apart the two
pumps and compared them. They look radically different, but dimensionally
the same. Only difference is in the gear width. The t1 is narrower than the
t4. So you can buy a high volume t1 pump and put it in a t4. Or if you
happen on a t4 pump, it will fit in a t1. 
So has anyone ever done this? I spent a long time looking them both over
very closely and could find nothing to say it could not be done. Anyone know
of any reason why it can not be done? As long as the high volume replacement
has gears the same width as the stock t4, it should work. Right?
