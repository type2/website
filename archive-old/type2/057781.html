On 8/27/98 11:05 AM, soundex_at_eden_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;I don't know about other states, but this reminds me of a real problem some
&gt;Texans have had - including me.
&gt;We have a weird little ant (native, less-stingy fireant I think) that LOVES
&gt;to nest up under the headliners, or behind the birch panels in westies,
&gt;etc. I've taken apart a bus that must've weighed 500 extra pounds in ant.
&gt;

     Never had ants, but I've had wasps setup little hives around my 
accel. cable, just above the tranny. This is a daily driver, too. Not fun 
to work down there when the wasps are going in and out of the hive. 
Haven't been stung yet, but if you watch me working on the bus you'll 
occasionally see me jump up and run like hell...   ;-) A good can of Raid 
seems to take care of it. They come back every year though...


Peace,
