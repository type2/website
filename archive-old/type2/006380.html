Hi All,
    In continuation of the fumes in cab thing, my 78 has ducts from the side
of the heater control flaps.  Or it does now.  When I bought the bus it was
missing the flex tubing from the heater control flaps to the &quot;optional&quot;
tailpipes.  The theory behind it is this.  When the heater is turned off in
the summer, spring or fall air is still directed through the heat exchangers
to the heater control flaps.  Apparrently this helps to cool the exhaust
down a tad before hitting the muffler.  If your heat exchangers have
develped small pin hole leaks inside the box, where it is near impossible to
find, exhaust fumes could get mixed into the air being pushed through the
exchangers.  Couple that with missing flex and you have exhaust fumes
exiting the bus directly underneath the bus in front of the engine.  Add a
couple of bad seals and woila! fumes in the cab.  A local VW shop told me
that these flex tubes were not necessary to proper functioning of the
vehicle and even suggested I remove the tailpipes that exit just in front of
the rear wheels... 10 minutes later I walked out of AutoZone with some of
that silver flex duct stuff and four hose clamps.  I like to think that
German Engineers have some reason for adding this feature.  BTW does anyone
know what year VW started this heater bypass exhaust thing??

    I'm still new at this whole advice thing, but I hope that experiences
that I have had with my 78 can help others not show up to work in a
non-rolled state of delusion.

&quot;Its easy. There are just four simple machines to alter force: the lever,
the pulley, the inclined plane, and, um, the internal combustion engine.&quot;
