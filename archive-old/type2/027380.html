Just a follow-up to some earlier discussion on emission woes and the merits 
of RV registration.  Like a lot of states, Missouri has instituted a new, 
more strict state-run emission test that my '77 Westy with custom exhaust 
pipes and Weber progressive would have never passed (and leaves no room for 
the garage to look the other way, not that I would condone that...)

I recently got in the mail my renewal notice and it only asked for safety 
inspection!  My understanding is that since it is registered as an 
RV/Motorhome it is exempt from emissions!  Don't know if it works in all 
states or if my case is just a fluke, but I'd look into it.  I think 
technically, in Missouri it is vehicle weight not class that exempts them 
from emissions.  Maybe I found a loophole.  Regardless, it saved my bus from 
turning into a giant yellow flowerpot.

YMMV
