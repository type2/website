Water or ping pong balls or something else...

Suggestion:  Get a 2 gallon gas can, fill it.  Then let the tank run dry...
change your fuel filter after this!  May even want to put 2 fuel filters in
before you run the tank dry; the rust and crud at bottom of tank...

The gas can is so you don't get stranded :)

My first suspect would be water in the gas tank.
