Subject: Gas lines - a cautionary tale

My see-thru pyrex gas filter (indispensible for figuring out the idle
problem was rust from the gas tank) isn't filtering fine enough to get all
the stuff, so I just added another, typical filter, to the line.  While
rummaging around back there, my fuel line slipped right off the pipe with
almost no pull at all.  A fire, or at least an empty tank, waiting to
happen.  I feel VERY lucky.

My mistakes probably include:  using US std fuel line, not the VW spec I
knew I should have used when I put the engine back in;  not checking the
worm gear band clamps (I found another that was not what you'd call real
tight) periodically for vibration looseness; having a copper line inside the
rubber where it passes through the fire wall (that was supposed to be a
safety thing, I though the tougher copper inside the rubber would help
prevent rattling (the grommet is gone) from abbrading the fuel line).  In
short, most of what you can do wrong in replacing a fuel line I managed to
do.

Learn from me, my friends.  But hey -  I got lucky:  no leak, no fire, cheap
lesson.

Hey Ron - have you got firewall grommets and VW spec fuel line?
