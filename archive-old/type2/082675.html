Subject: ADMIN:  Viruses, not from us.


Michael sent this to me in a private email voicing his concerns. I'm
responding to the list to perhaps help to deter future questions.

Actually, no, this isnt from us.

A quick look at the headers of the message would show that it has no
Received: line that shows it coming through our mailserver.

http://www.sophos_dot_com/virusinfo/analyses/w32kleze.html

This is actually the W32/Klez-E worm.

Pretty much any copy of this you get will have a From: line that is
actually chosen from an address list built up from your address book as
well as your inbox....that is, it makes it LOOK like the message came from
someone else. It does a good job of it, too. (makes it rather hard to
figure out who to warn that they have the virus..)


You CAN tell, though, that it didnt come from us. (I've seen these now
showing as having come from various type2_dot_com addresses, including my
own...and also many completely invalid type2_dot_com addresses.)

In Outlook, and Outlook Express,  if you right-click the message, choose
&quot;Properties&quot;

Now click on the next Tab, I dont recall the name..but you only have two
to choose from.

This tab will show you the full headers of the email in question.

IF you see a line that looks like the following:

Received: from (12.129.13.30) by ....

OR:

Received: from pon.type2_dot_com (12.129.13.30) by ....

or similar, then it is possible that the message came by way of us.  If
you DONT see either 12.129.13.30 or pon.type2_dot_com in the received headers
anywhere, (or our old IP address, 128.241.76.29) then the message DID NOT
come from us.

There is very little chance you'll see such an infected email come through
our mailserver.  If you do, though, feel free to email me, or any of the
other admins, OFF LIST, with your concerns.
