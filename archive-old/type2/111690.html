Subject: Re: [T2] Custom Wheels

&gt; &lt;&lt; Has anybody had any success recently in finding custom
&gt; alloy wheels to
&gt; fit their bus? My bus is a '79 Riviera with a 5-112 bolt
&gt; pattern and I
&gt; can't find any wheels other than the stock ones. I'm
&gt; looking for a 15,
&gt; 16, or 17 inch wheel with a mid offset.  I've tried the
&gt; American Racing
&gt; Aero, but the dust cover on the axle hub protrudes too
&gt; far. Who makes a
&gt; wheel that fits out of the box?
none that I know of, but.....have been thinking of swapping
brake drums/discs for ones with the old wide-five pattern
and gete the polished empi-5-lug style. They really look
good on the buses(not as good as on a splittie, but still
better than anything else that exhists...but as noted
below, the bolt pattern is the same for teh Mercedes(and
Audi!! My friend and I ahve been hourding the audi ones and
AI will be finding out shourtly what needs to be machined
out. regarding hogging out the holes for teh acorn nuts?  I
say stay away from that, get the nuts/studs that are
designed for the wheels(mercedes/audi and life will be
easier(AND SAFER!!!)

Paul(hoping to end up with the chrome 14&quot; mercedes on my
'78 westy, b ut may end up with one of the 15 or 16&quot; audi
sets instead...we'll see!)


&gt; I've got Mercedes-Benz alloys on my Bus (79), but you've
&gt; got to hog the
&gt; bolt holes out by 1/16 to fit the VW studs and use a ball
&gt; grinder to dish
&gt; the steel inserts to accept the VW acorn lug nuts. At the
&gt; back a slight
&gt; relief is needed to clear the 10 MM bolt heads that hold
&gt; the drums in
&gt; place. The offset is close to the stock wheel. I would
&gt; guess that the
&gt; wheels that fit the M-B pattern should fit the VW, but an
&gt; offset might
&gt; scrape at the rear... ??
