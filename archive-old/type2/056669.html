Subject: Stub axle for Dan Burgos (dburgos_at_acsu.buffalo_dot_edu)

Volks,

I asked about whether a loaf rear stub axle would intercghange with a
vanagon because I know where there is one, but I will not be able to get
to it before this weekend.  I think the list wisdom is that any loaf or
vanagon axle will fit, so if anyone has one and can get it to him before
then, please get in touch with him!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
