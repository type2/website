&gt; Has anyone installed the VDO vacuum gauge? I know it's a mechanical gauges but is it partly electrical or does a really long length of tubing have to run all the way to the gauge from the vacuum port?

I have it installed in my dash.  The only electrical hookup is for the lighting.  It is possible to run a length of vacuum hose all the way from the rear - I chose to relocate my oneway valve for the brake booster to just behind the booster and install a Tee just behind that.  This allowed me to run a much shorter length of vacuum hose up to the gauge.  If I had it to do over again, I would just run the longer hose.
