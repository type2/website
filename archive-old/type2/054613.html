Subject: Fules Filter &amp; Trans.

Volks,

I need to put a fuel filter in my bus before I get it all  back together and 
was wondering what everyone else was using? Also I got the engine back in 
and everything assembled except the fuel line and a few wires. I was 
shifting through the gearbox with my foot on the clutch and noticed some 
resistance when going into gears, but if I move it around a few times it 
will eventually be fine. I am wondering if I need to change my tranny oil, 
it seems to be quite loud (you can hear the gears inside the case) when you 
shift. It almost like something isn't lining up right but if you wiggle it 
enough it will. I just put in a new clutch and pressure plate and I 
wondering if this could be caused by the clutch not lined up perfectly with 
the trans shaft?? I don't think so cause the engine isn't even running, but 
it just dosn't seem to be the same as before I put in the new clutch. Maybe 
I just need to drive it a few miles to break in the new clutch.

cheers....
