Subject: Re: BN2 Gas Heater Q's and A's (long).

&gt;&quot;The BN2 model gas heater is a 12 volt system. It mounted on the drivers'
&gt;side of the car (bug/ghia), and is turned on by a lever in the passenger
&gt;compartment (near the hood release). When the lever is pulled, the gas
&gt;heater is turned on. The gas heater uses a low volume, low pressure electric
&gt;fuel pump to deliver the fuel from the car's gas tank to a jet in the gas
&gt;heater, which restricts how much fuel is delivered to the combustion
&gt;chamber. Any excess fuel is rerouted to the car's gas tank. 

This describes a B 2 heater, not a BN 2.  Both are also available in 6 volt.

The ignition
&gt;source is a 12 volt glow plug. 

actually, it is  4 volt.  It is hooked up to a series resistance.

&gt;heat), and blown into the car - it is a recirculating heater.

Most are non-recirculating. I think (but can't yet prove) that '70 was the
only year for a recirculating B 2.



&gt;airports), as you can gas yourself if the gas heaters combustion chamber is
&gt;cracked or rusted
 
Not with an Eberspacher.  Not only are the heat exchangers stainless steel,
but &quot;Since the static pressure on the fresh air side is higher than on the
gas mixture side, exhaust gas cannot blend with the fresh air, even if the
heat exchanger is not hermetic, and any danger that such gasses may enter
the passenger cabin is excluded.&quot;  This is quoted from a B 2 manual and is
true for all Eberspachers.
