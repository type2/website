Subject: RE: [T2] Westfalia Wood Stain- Solved!

Slightyly Off topic but.. I just used about 5.5 gals. of that stuff on some 
oak floors I refinished. Loved it. Works great easy application no sanding 
required between coats, dried fast. Low odor. $30/gal. at Lowes.

'77 Westy Deluxe, &quot;el Verde&quot;





&gt;From: Paul Deatherage &lt;
&gt;I have been redoing the inside of my 73 westy for a while now. I just cut 
&gt;out new panelling from new 3mm baltic birch. I've been buying half-pint 
&gt;cans of stain, trying each one out and was growing very frustrated. I tried 
&gt;the following: Minwax Fast-Drying Polyurethane Clear Satin, Clear Semigloss 
&gt;and Clear Gloss. These stains took the fleshy colors out of the wood. It 
&gt;changed it to a gold/brown color which looked good, but wouldn't match my 
&gt;original headliner. I tried Minwax White Pine, which looked good, but 
&gt;obscured the grain. I tried pickled white wash and it looked like a dirty, 
&gt;dingy grey. Today, I finally found something that looks pretty darn close 
&gt;to, if not just like the original. It is Olympic Interior Water Based 
&gt;Polyurethane Crystal Clear Satin finish. This brought out the sort of 
&gt;fleshy pink color that the original had and that other stains obscured. 
&gt;I'll have pictures up as soon as I get them all stained and installed. For 
&gt;now you can see the original headliner color I
&gt;  was trying to match near the bottom of page 9 at 
&gt;www_dot_cardomain_dot_com/id/deathead777 I hope this information is helpful to 
&gt;someone.
