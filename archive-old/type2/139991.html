Subject: Re: [T2] Engine balance - (warning, heresy included!)

&gt; forces and the design of the crank cause the crank to have a natural
&gt; frequency of one.  As a result, the number two main bearing saddle is
&gt; subject to a *lot* of side-to-side force and will eventually pound out.
&gt; This pounding is what results in the old rule about &quot;if you can read the
&gt; bearing numbers in the saddle, it's time for an align bore.&quot;  This is a
&gt; built-in flaw and the only cure is to redesign the engine; all the static
&gt; and rotaional balancing in the world will reduce but will not cure it.
&gt; In the type 4 engine Volkswagen did strengthen the # 2 saddle and changed
&gt; the alloy which reduced this problem.  As a result type 4 cases rarely
&gt; need align boring.  For the type 1 engine, however, there is a design
&gt; limit to how long the engine will last no matter how good the static and
&gt; rotaional balance are.
&gt; 
&gt; I bring this up because I believe that while one gram is a worthy aim for
&gt; pistons and rods, .1 gram for street use on a type 1 engine is excessive.
&gt; Nice if your rebuilder will go that &quot;extra mile&quot;, and maybe worth doing on
&gt; a type 4 engine but even there perhaps excessive.  What point is there to
&gt; balancing the pistons and rods to last 500,000 miles if the mains are
&gt; going to go at 60-100,000 miles because of the engine design?
&gt; 

Hello Steve    While this is mostly true Vw did improve the later type 1 
cases using a harder alloy so that the bearings saddles were stronger ./ If you 
ever talk to Boston Bob Mcdonald(Bosto Engines) He is always looking for late FI 
bug cases for building motors in Zambowias (SP)  the things that smooth ice 
rinks , which are very hard on motors. Some of these use the VW diesel motor . 
Balancing the rotating parts on a motor will only help it last longer . only 
cost about $75.00 down here   .   later and have fun Mark Dearing   PS  Bring 
what it is that you need an architect for with you and I can help you out  .
