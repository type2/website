Subject: Oil gallery plug shavings averted

	So after panicking and calling everyone I knew, turns out the diagram I
drew was correct. The lower gallery plug does lead from the screw-in oil
filter down to the oil pump. I popped the pump cover off and saw a few
shavings that had wandered down that way and cleaned them out with a Q-tip
and aerosol carb cleaner.

	Things I learned:

	1) If you do this, you may not be able to tap all the way in for the new
plug to become flush. I wound up using a &quot;shorty&quot; tap, e.g., a plumbing one
that gets narrower at the tip. Likewise, the plugs, bought from local boys
in Austin, have the same sort of thread. Inside at least one of the plug
holes there's a little lip that prevents the tap from going in more than,
say, allows for half of the new plug.

	2) Grease on the tap does work, but clean it maybe every 180 or 360 deg
max. Shavings build up quick.

	3) Bust out Q-tips, sometimes a blob of grease on the end will trap
shavings.

	4) Open up both ends of the passage if you can, to catch loose shavings.
Plug the holes with a sponge, too, while you tap. I could shoot carb cleaner
straight from the gallery hole down through to the oil pump and flushed
things out good. Felt much, much better. No plugged journals for me!

	5) Even though it looks that way, the oil pressure release valve under the
case does NOT run into these passages. Ask me how I know.

	I'll be using gasgacinch on the plugs to seal it up. Even though aluminum
can be pretty soft, don't crank on those things too hard - you might crack
the case!

	Thanks for y'all's patience,

	Ian
