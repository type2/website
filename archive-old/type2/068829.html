Subject: 2-Stroke v. 4-Stroke

I imagine, I *know* I ought to RTFM but if anybody feels like elucidating
there are some questions I've had for years. I'm not sure about overlap, my
remembry is that more overlap makes for smoother idle and better burn but
lower torque. I don't know where that came from and it could be wrong . My
remembry also is that there's more overlap in the average street engine
than you might expect, like 30 degrees.

Anyway WRT 2-stroke: begs the question, two strokes per what? Revolution?
Fire? I cannot get straight in my head how a 2-stroke would work. Clearly
the exhast valve can't be open on the compression stroke.

I'm talking about chainsaws and weed whackers and certain awesome
motorcycles. If you want to stop a YZ, you'd better chain it to a tree.
Maybe I have the sematics wrong. I know the valves are different, they're
essentially flaps, but beyond that I know naught.

And another thing. Howcome they can run upside down where we can't? They
put their oil in their gas, but how does it get to the bearings and all? If
we ran upside down our oil wouldn't fall into the sump so we'd lose
pressure, but could a 4-cycle run upside down if we put several jiggers of
oil in the gas tank? Surely not...

I have to change out a well-thrashed Japanese automatic transmission for a
less thrashed used one this weekend. And try as I might I cannot find
anything interesting about that. I forsee some frustration and much
crampedness of space, that's about it. If it bolts up and works I still
won't have the faintest idea *why* it works. But my wife will not be
carless anymore.

Busses are better. Better than outboard motors and better than Honda cars.
I don't completely understand how my VW trans works either but they're
still better. ;)
