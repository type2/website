Subject: Re: [T2] Where are all the busses?

&gt;  Hey all,
       Finally something I have some knowledge and exposure to. Prior to 
moving to southeastern Connecticut
I lived in Stanwood, Washington. Half way between Seattle and Canada. It 
must be the Bus capital of the
country from my experience. Not so much Stanwood, but the area in 
general. There are even bus shops
and sales offices,etc. You can get anything done in the area. Buses and 
bugs all over the place. I had previously
lived in San Diego and there are alot there also. I was in for a culture 
shock once we relocated to CT.
I have seen a grand total of six buses and a few bugs in five years. I 
know it probably has alot to do with
the weather. I drive mine about seven months a year here.  I get alot of 
attention with my bus here. On the
West coast it was ho hum. I miss the PNW area. More ways than one too. 
Life doesnt get much better
than Northern CA and up. All you listees have a great weekend regardless 
where your travels may take you.
Butch
Run for the sun!!!
