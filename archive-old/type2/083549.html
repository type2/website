Subject: Tail Light Troubles

--=====================_889472414==_

alright..here comes my second question (one of many probs that i'm still tryin to figure out;(. 
i've been workin on gettin my TAIL LIGHTS in order. but i'm still stuck. 
so here it is: they work PERFECT, now, when my headlights are OFF. but when i turn my headlights ON....one of my brake lights comes on, on my passanger side taillight, without my brakes applied. and also when my headlights are ON, my turn signals don't work. everything works fine with my hdlights OFF. but w/them ON i have these problems.
any ideas? is my problem in my dimmer relay, or in my wiring? i've messed with switching my wires around on my tail lights. checked to make sure my bulbs are in right. and i've replaced my wire connectors and cleaned up the terminals on the taillights. BUT, i'm still havin problems. which leads me to believe it's in my relay.
thanks again for sharen the knowledge and ideas, they're much appreciated. *shine on* -Chris (newbie w/a 70westie)
