heh, heh, heh,

What did you all put for the 'extra credit essay' at the end, entitled
'how do you like your car?' ?

Here's mine --
&quot;My bus is like my best friend.
You could not name a single car in the world that I would swap it for,
other than to sell that car in order to buy back my bus plus a hundred
other buses (and maybe a couple Porsche 356's if I had some money
left over :-)&quot;

Do you think they'll send round the little men in white coats?
