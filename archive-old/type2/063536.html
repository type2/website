The first two digits signify the type: 23 ...bus...????camper???. The
third digit signifies the year: 1966. The rest of the number signifies
where your bus falls in the production run.

Not only is it a '66, but it's a very early '66. Note the 712, which I
would ****ASSUME**** signifies that yours was the 712th bus made for that
year model...and they made hundreds of thousands of them. It's probably
one of the earliest 10 or 20 '66 buses still in existence. At least, it's
nice to believe that!

One thing about being early or late in a production run: you may find
subtle differences between your bus and others of that year. For example,
some of your wiring may be a different color, or you may be missing some
features that came out later in the year.

Smile; be happy!
