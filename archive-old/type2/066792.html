Subject: compression test, safety

- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hello all again.

I hope these newbie questions are not too annyoing.

My question now is about the compression test.
I've neglected this on all my cars, and never done it.  Next time I 
look at the bus, it's on the list to do.

My concern is about safety.  Since you take off all the plugs, and lay the 
plug wires around, won't gasoline be coming out of the sparkplug holes?
Won't those wires be getting a current?  Isn't this a dangerous combination?
Muir didn't mention this factor, so I'm asking you, who's done it a thousand
times.

regards,
