Not a hard one- put it in the garage to protect it from the elements and let
everything else sit outside under a car cover ;)
Seriously, if all it needs is rockers, get one of those costco shelters with
sides and work on it when you get time. If its sat all this time its no
surprise it smokes at startup, just needs to be driven.

&gt; John,
&gt;
&gt; &lt;Big sigh here&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Based on your daughter's comment, it's time to go check out the storage
&gt; rental places.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It isn't the money, it's the space.&lt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Buy some space....and time.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
&gt;

&gt; &gt; All this talk about unrestored buses is hitting home.  I have a '71
Westy
&gt; &gt; with an honest 59K on it.  The body is badly rusted along the rockers
and
&gt; &gt; corners, the interior is beautiful (PO had it for 27 years, no kids,
used it
&gt; &gt; two weeks a year).  I've had the brakes completely redone (new drums,
&gt; &gt; slaves, calipers, etc.), and the engine ran perfectly until just before
I
&gt; &gt; garaged it almost two years ago.  It starts right up and runs around
like an
&gt; &gt; old friend when I run it occassionally, but smokes after it warms up.  I
&gt; &gt; haven't run that one down yet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My point is that it pains me to have it sit there.  I'm a year behind on
a
&gt; &gt; house restoration job, and I just can't pay any attention to it.  It's
not
&gt; &gt; even registered at the moment.  The new house has a nasty little one car
&gt; &gt; garage, and the second car is going to sit off to the side on the
driveway
&gt; &gt; as it is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe it's time to just say goodbye, and get another when I have room.
It
&gt; &gt; cheers me up just sitting in it, and as my daughter once said, you just
&gt; &gt; can't be angry when you're driving the bus.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can't be the only listee who's had to face this one, and it's Friday.
It
&gt; &gt; isn't the money, it's the space.  What do you say:  I don't want to
store it
&gt; &gt; way out elsewhere, but I feel stuck and the clock is ticking.  Thoughts?
