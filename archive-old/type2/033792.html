Subject: PLFVW/todd hill/???

Perhaps in the volkswagen community a new e-business model has come to the
fore?

(the following is hypothetical, no description of actual businesses 
is expresed or implied)

1) decide to start an internet based VW business based on charging higher
prices for a better quality product/skill.
2) Do good work for a few vocal people so that one gets a &quot;quickie&quot;
reputation for a quality product on various net lists/groups. (word
spreads like wildfire online)  
3) continue to do good work until you get so many advance orders you can't
seem to fill em
4) stop working but continue collecting orders and make excuses to people
whose orders you have taken but not filled.  Try to make the reasons
believable enough that these people dont publicly flame you and cut off
your supply of cash from new orders.
5) dissapear with peoples cores/money/orders etc. before/immediately after
the sh*t hits the fan.

The moral:

Shooting stars burn very brightly, but fade away just as quickly.

peas,

Steve
