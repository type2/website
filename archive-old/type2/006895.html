Subject: CV joints, shifter kit
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com (list)

Hi everybody!  (Hi Dr. Nick!)

having trouble reinstalling my CV joints on the driver's side; both are 
attached with boots to the driveshaft but can't wedge back in.  Passengers' 
side had no oval washers - is this the difference?

Also having hard time with shifter kit - empi style with plate and longer 
bolts.  Need tips on that spring pin.  Help!   thanks - RY
