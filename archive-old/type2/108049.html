Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

Whenever I camp in a place with electric, I still run off my aux battery
with an invertor.. But I run an ext cord to a battery charger that is hooked
to my aux  :)  My bus doesn't have the plug in for shore power as Westy's do
and this works for me.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
