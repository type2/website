Subject: Re: [T2] Windshield-some data

&gt; I still maintain the reality here that is if your bus is that rusted in
this location it is rusted elsewhere beyond the value of actual metal work.
Now I'll agree with John there are odd exceptions, like AZ or FL buses where
the rubber dried or the salt settled from being on the coast, so I qualify,
for the bulk of the US north of St Louis where the
&gt; rust is indicative of rust elsewhere on the body I still say bondo it
folks.

This may indeed be so, ie., that the cost of having the metal work done
would be prohibitive.  But there are other solutions.

My 72 Riviera, which obviously came from the Pacific NW and spent some time
in Canada, but which has mostly lived in LA, had small hole swiss cheese
under the windshield, and almost no rust anywhere else.

Similar situation for list member Mark Durrant.  Last summer he posted that
he needed some help with the situation, and we got together and did both of
our busses together with my  mig welder and our joint labor.

End result was that we fixed our rust problems, and had a lot of fun working
together on our busses which are both in much better shape than 6 months
ago.  So in the true DIY spirit of bus ownership,  I would like to gently
advocate creative solutions which don't involve big time cash layouts.

Regards,

Grant
