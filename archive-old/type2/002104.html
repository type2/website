Hi all,
I read the list a lot, but this is only my second post,
so pardon mois if i screw up.

Here's the problem:
Bought a 69 Westy about a month ago, had a few minor problems, such as I had
to replace
the fuel pump, &amp; new points, set timing etc...so far no problem...
Now for the problem..The PO had an external oil cooler.  The oil lines tied
into an adaptor
where the factory unit went.  The lines also passed through an external
bracket
mounted oil filter.  (I plead ignorance.  This is my first VW)
So I check the oil, drive it home, wash it, wax it, putter around a bit, and
do all that a proud owner
would do with his new toy...then I am cleaing the engine bay,a
and notice oil on everthing...I mean bummer.  So I check the
oil...and pooof...wooooaaa!!!!  Where's the oil?  Very little in the
crankcase, and tons all over everything.  So I get some ND 30w,
and pour a quart in, and watch it happily run out the rear main
and I assume the front main seal, and make two lovely puddles.
Well I do a little investigating, and find out the PO does not have a bypass
type filter,
just an el cheapo external oil filter, and just did an oil a few weeks
prior.
 Now the case is a 41 type, and the engine tin looks like crap, so I pulled
the engine today,
and tore it down partially (got tired, and will go again tomorrow)
Here's what I found:   There is no ridge in the cyls, the heads look
beautiful,. (single port heads),
(I plan on going all the way down scratch, and am going back with a 6 circle
DMS crank, with
74mm stroke)
Now the question (geees its about time!)  Whats with the oil thing? ( I used
shop air, and verified
that the external cooler is flowing...no problem)
Was it the no bypass filter? Could the PO have screwed up when he installed
the dual reliefs?
Both?  To make matters worse, the seam in the crankcase had signs of
silicone...yuk.
Once I got the engine on the stand, and got the tin off, it was obvious that
oil was happily
pouring out around where the adapter bolted up to where the factory cooler
was, as well as the main seals.
Should I go back with the factory cooler, drill and tap for full flow, and
keep the external cooler
and filter setup?  Trash it?  I need some experienced input.
I need help...I'm an anal-retentive clean freak who loves a fine looking,
fine running motor...
this oil gusher aint the kind I'm a hopin' fer, and I am clueless.
