&gt;On Star Trek Voyager tonight there was a baby blue '74 or '75 (maybe)
&gt;hardtop westi that was used as a getaway vehicle. &lt;snip&gt; But anyway, has
anyone else seen a westi as a getaway van. 
&gt;And yes you have a trekie on your hands (just kidding).

  Remember the getaway vw van in the Chuck Norris movie?

 They're in Beiruit or so and the Army is hot on their ass and there
are 30 cal machine gun bullets eating up the back of that van.

 Don't try this at home ladies.  :-)     west
