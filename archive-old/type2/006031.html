Subject: Timing help with '71 Westy

I need some help with my '71Westy.  I recently tuned it up, adjusted the point dwell to 48 degrees, and adjusted the carburetor.  I am confused about how to set the timing.  It is a 1600cc engine, with a single carb, and a B5 engine number.  It also has a -009 disty on it.  There is a single notch on the pulley.  The engine was recently rebuilt, and the timing was set to the right of the notch, which implies to me that it was set to 5 deg. BTDC.  From what I read in Muir and Bentley, it should be set to 5 deg. ATDC--i.e., to the left of the notch in the pulley.  I currently have it set at the notch, since Muir implies that the notch might actually be at 5 ATDC, but it seems to run a little worse, hesitating from a stop.

Can you help me out here?  Thanks.  Please respond off-line, as I am in digest mode.
