Subject: help with brake shoes

Oh great list!

I have a weird one.

I am replacing the rear brake shoes on my 71 type 2.  The ones I 
ordered from bus depot were slightly longer and had a tapered end 
where they sit in the adjusting star slot.  They were also a bit 
narrower.  It looked like small differences so I went ahead and put 
them on.  With my adjusting stars backed in all the way, the brakes 
are too big, ie the drum will just barely fit, and is rubbing too 
strongly to fit.  I went to a local vw parts supply, and got the ones 
for the 71 bus.  They are as wide as the original old ones, but still 
longer (although a bit shorter than the ones from BusDepot) and still 
tapered on the end that goes in the adjusting star slot.

I checked the brake cylinder and it is contracted completely,  and am 
now officially stumped.  Do I have the brake plate from a different 
year bus?  My adjusting star set up is in the shape of a
&quot;V&quot; not straight, if that gives a clue.

HELP!  Jerome is coming and I was trying to leave tomorrow night after work!

Please pmail me, as I am on digest.
