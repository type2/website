Subject: Re: Right Rear Emergency Brake Arm

Bentley, and I believe Haynes, have an illustration of the components of the rear brakes on a 1971 and later bus.  This illustration shows that the parking brake lever is attached to the rear shoe just as it is on my 1972 Westy.  All you need to do is take off the two bolts that hold the drum on, 11mm wrench, remove the drum, may be difficult with the rust, remove the rear brake shoe and disconnect the parking brake cable and take it home.  The lever is held on by a larger diameter pin and circle clip.  Take the lever off and put in on the new brake shoe.

Hope this helps.  If ytou need more info, let me know.

&gt;     A friend of mine has a 72 Dormobile and she is missing the right Rear
&gt; Emergency Brake arm that is under the hub.  Anybody have one at a =
&gt; decent price?
&gt; The local used Import Auto parts has busses and I was quoted a price of $20
&gt; bucks over the phone but when I got there he says &quot;Have you ever had to pull
&gt; one of those hubs?&quot;  I raised the Left Rear piece to show him I had.  Then
&gt; he says&quot;You know those VW's have been sitting in the dirt for over 5 years?&quot;
&gt; I said all I want is the part not the life history of your VW's.  He says&quot;
&gt; I'll have to charge you $100 if I send my guy out there to pull the hub&quot; I
&gt; said I called and you quoted me $20 for the part  No it will have to be $100
&gt; As I walked out as I thought of the list.  I know that one of you has a bus
&gt; that you are parting out and I need the Right Rear emergency brake arm that
&gt; is inside of the hub so that the bus will have emergency brakes.
&gt; Thanks for your help
