Hi John,

I actually meant the hatch located above the engine hatch. I don't know
how to call it in English, sorry. From the outside the hatches look
exactly the same, but it seems that somewhere in the early seventies
they changed the hinges. I also encountered this problem when I tried to
fit a 1969 Westy interrior into my 1978 Kombi. I had to cut out a piece
of the closet, otherwise I wouldn't be able to close the rear hatch
anymore.

Still I don't know the exact year when the hinges were changed, so if
anyone can tell, let me know.
