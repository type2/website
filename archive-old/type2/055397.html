Subject: 77 into a 78

The motor in my 78 bus is toast and I am looking into the possible option of
putting a donor motor from a 77 into place.

Aside from the fact that the 77 has solid lifters, is the fuel injection
system/components  all the same..in other words will it be straight bolt
in/hook up  or will I have to jury rig some elec connections?

And trannys should be same as well?? Yes??

Glen
