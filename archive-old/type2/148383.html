&gt; Remember that the wheels were hardly smooth from the factory!  :)

I have a spare on a never used factory rim that's been in the spare  
tire cabinet of my westy since it was purchased. When I compared it  
to the other wheels I mainly noticed that brake dust had really  
pitted the wheels.

I'm not sure how the factory finished them but they always look great  
to me.
