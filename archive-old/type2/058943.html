&gt; Hi All!
&gt; I reread the archive on the asbestos thing with some alarm.  I had to drop off
&gt; this list for a year and I had not heard that vwoa is no longer  performing the
&gt; asbestos clean up on our busses.  Don't mean to start a flame war so I withhold
&gt; my opinion on this.  The question: My 74 has the original &quot;factory jacket&quot;
&gt; around the heater tube that extends the length of the bus.  Does anyone know if
&gt; this is asbestos (it is white where the outer cover has eroded)?  There is a lot
&gt; 
&gt; of it (about 5 feet long) and it's going to be a real hassle to have it tested,
&gt; and remove/dispose of it properly.

Well, what's to stop you from tearing it off yourself and 
tossing it?  

This isn't nerve gas we're talking about.  The whole 
&quot;EEEEEEEEEK!  Asbestos!!! BOOGABOOGA!&quot; scare got 
started when people who worked around the stuff all
their lives developed respiratory problems.  The threat
posed by a five-foot by five-inch sheet of the stuff is,
as far as I'm concerned, about the same as that posed
by an errant meteorite.  Wear a dust mask.  Be careful
cutting the straps which hold it on.  Put it in a 
garbage bag, tie it up securely, take a shower, do your
laundry. 

If you want to be *really* safe, douse it with water to 
help prevent dust from flying before removing it. 

End of problem.
