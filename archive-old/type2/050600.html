&gt; Now I'm all messed up. My question was what do you do if you measure your

&gt; two of the answers I got back made reference to leveling the bus on jack
&gt; stands BEFORE measuring the spring plate angle. Doesn't that defeat the
&gt; purpose? Aren't we trying to tell how much the bus deviates from level as it
&gt; sits attached to Mother Earth on its own four wheels? Or am I totally
&gt; missing the point here?

Well, if you are measuring the bus itself on its wheels, remember to
measure it on a level surface with 180 pounds or so in the driver's seat.
I measure the floor just inside the sliding door.

One mistake folks make is to think that because they can't see the horizon
in the inside rear view mirror that their rear end is sagged.  Not true!

The procedure you refer to above where the bus is leveled first on
jackstands is the first step to adjusting the spring plates.  To do this,
the bearing carriers must be removed from the spring plates, the torsion
housing caps removed, and the spring plates released from their lower
stops.  Then you can measure the spring plate angle relative to the
horizontal to be sure that it meets the spec for your year and model bus.
You adjust both ends of the splines alternately to get this angle to spec.

You _can_ do this without leveling the bus, but then you have to measure
the deck angle of the bus and then add or subtract this value from the
spring plate angles.  I prefer to level the bus first and remove a
variable from the equation.
