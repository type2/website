Subject: Cylinder Heads

The 1976 Westie started making a bad noise on the way back from Baja.  It was
Saturday, no mechanics on duty, so I left it at a mechanics shop in Yuma.  I
live in Tucson.  So now the bus is there and I am here.  The mechanic works at
Off Road Buggy Supply.  I know nearly nothing about him; he seems to know his
stuff well enough.  He tells me that the head of the intake valve on the #1
valve is broken.  He says a new head is needed.  It's a 1976 Westie with a 2.0L
FI engine.

I have three questions:

1) Would it be wisest to have both heads replaced?  The heads came from an
engine rebuild about 25,000 miles ago, I have no idea of the source of the
rebuilt engine or of the heads.  Soon after the engine rebuild, I was told that
the valves were hydraulic and as such didn't have to be adjusted, so they went
the first 5,000 miles or so without adjustment, until the #1 valve was so closed
down that it was making noise and I took it to a mechanic (in Salt Lake City)
and found out that the valves were not hydraulic.

2) The mechanic says that he generally uses IAP or WAWD heads.  The list folks
seem to prefer Mark Stephens and AVP heads.  Does anyone have experience with
IAP or WAWD?  Are they as good as AVP and Stephens heads?  Should I tell the
mechanic that I want AVP (or Stephens) heads instead and order them myself?

3) Does anyone on the list live in Yuma who can tell me about
experience/knowledge with Off Road Buggy Supply?

Thanks,
Jeannie
