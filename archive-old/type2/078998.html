Subject: Re: [T2] 1.7-2.0 MPG?

&gt; Just wondering what city/highway MPG you type 4
&gt; engined guys and gals get.  Please identify year,
&gt; engine, fuel system type, and any pertinent mods
&gt; (ignition etc).

78 westy standard 23-25  mpg stock FI pertronix ignitor ignition module flame thrower coil and wires - i credit this with a 1-2 mpg increase at least and dramatic increase in power.  72-74 heat exchangers and VERY crappy pacesetter muffler, would like to try and retrofit cat and also considering going to CIS because
i am in love with its simplicity (GF has a 90 fox that i am the unofficial mechanic for)
that is mixed mpg, about 50 50 highway and city.  lowest mpg i have gotten is about 22 and best was a tad better than 25
