&gt; graffiti all over it. She asked how many owners my Bus
&gt; had, I said I don't know, it just got here from Cali

I know but purely by co incidence, I accidently met the guy who the person
I bought it from had bought it from when he saw me sitting on the side of
the road (GEX engine failure) and he told me about the guy he bought it
from who was oringinal owner.. so I am fourth owner but I only know this
by chance.

&gt; air-cooled engines dont last that long. She asked how
&gt; many engines my Bus has had? I said I don't know, it

again for the same reason I know I had heard from the previous owners.

&gt; could be the original one. She said again, I should
&gt; know these things, I lost it at that point and told
&gt; her nobody would know these things unless you owned it
&gt; from day one. Am I nuts?

well you probably are nuts, your selling a beautiful 77 Westy.  but then
isn't being just a little nuts a requirment for owning one of these
things.

hang in there.

maybe more than just a little nuts, I've had the same bus 15 years.
