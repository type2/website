You're in for some fun.  Give yourself extra time and bring a friend.  The
type IV setup is heavier than the type I.

&gt;My question is do I have to support the tranny.

No.

&gt;Also is there any way I can tell if an engine it the original engine or
&gt;not.

Not easily.  Maybe by the serial number.
