Subject: Re: [T2] My rebuilt engine started &quot;Clanking&quot; today!!!!! :o(

Hello List,

Well, I went outside today and pulled the valve covers
off my engine to see if somthing had come loose in
there. Unfortunately, nothing had. I reinstalled the
valve covers, did another visual inspection of the
engine and found nothing. I cranked the engine back
up. At first, the engine ran perfectly. Once it warmed
up, I was getting 17-18 inches of vacuum at idle and
it was running strong! The engine was ticking like it
always had and then it started. It was not lifter
noise. The engine started to knock. I used a length of
fuel line like a stethascope and tried to figure out
where the noise was comming from. I heard it the
loudest when I placed it in the middle of the crank
case twards the front of the engine (front means
front). The knocking became louder and louder so I
killed the switch. My guess is that one of the rods is
comming apart or a bearing has sliped out or somthing.
While the engine knocked, the engine vacuum did not
change and it did not mis. 

&quot;&quot;&quot;QUESTION&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

Why would the engine only start knocking when it has
completely warmed up? The knock started on me the
other day but when I first cranked it up today, the
knock was gone. Do you think it is logical to expect
that if the engine is torn apart, only the offending
nut, stud, bearing, whatever, can just be replaced
with out doing a complete over haul? This was sold to
me as a rebuilt engine so I assume (dangerous) that it
has new pistons, rings, cylinders, cam, bearings,
seals, ect. This 0 mile engine runs strong when not
knocking. My free time is limited lately so I would
probably have to send the engine out to be rebuilt.
Would Boston Bob do this? Thanks for all the help!!!

Regards,

David Kelly

&gt; This is not a happy day. I went outside to tinker
&gt; with
&gt; my rebuilt 914 engine. I started to notice
&gt; that
&gt; the engine noise became louder.  Within a
&gt; matter of 5 seconds, the noise became louder and
&gt; turned into a loud clanking noise!!! I turned the
&gt; engine off immediately and did a visual inspection
&gt; of
&gt; the motor to make sure that a screw driver or
&gt; something had not become caught in the fan belt. I
&gt; turned the engine over a few more times and the
&gt; noise
&gt; was there, louder than before. I turned off
&gt; everything
&gt; and came back inside.
