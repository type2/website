Jeff Tickner bloviated:
Air conditioning a little VW bus is about the silliest excess-baggage idea
 I've seen cross this list since I subscribed. There. I said it and I'm
glad.

Dear Jeff,

Here in Philadelphia, I might agree with you. Or in most Northern states or
California (which is too cold for me).
But in Texas, dude, you better have air, or the bus is left at the starting
gate from May to October. That is a long, long
time to let it rest for no reason, when a little aire acondicionado is all
that it takes to let it run.

I have one A/Ced 72 Transporter. It gets used year round (it also has a
gasoline heater salvaged from a Thing, which makes it usable in winter as
well. Oh, that's right. It's too dang cold to drive the bus in Texas between
December and February, with temperatures fluctuating between zero F and 50 F
nighttime. I'll never forget the hour of driving in 28 degrees with nothing
but the standard heating on my Westy!!!!! Yow. I almost gave it away.

So let's see with March, April and October and November, that is 4 months
out of 12 we can enjoy bussing  in Texas, without auxiliary heat and air.

Wow. Why do we live here?

As my wife so gently puts it, &quot;Because we can't live anywhere else.&quot;
And A/C makes it a really cool place to live.

Chuck
75 Westy - El Armadillo (no durn a/c)
72 BayWindow - The IceBox (plenty of refrigerated air!)
79 Transporter - Sheba (no a/c but living in Pennsylvania)
