Subject: Re: Westy Upholstery

&gt;Hello Bus People,
&gt;Can anyone recommend any reasonably priced auto upholstery
&gt;shops in the San Diego County or Tijuana area.  I was
&gt;going to try this myself, but now I think I'll get
&gt;estimates from a pro. Both of my front seats and the
&gt;rear folding z-bed are shredded.  Thanks for any input.
&gt;
&gt;Tom Riis
&gt;70 Westy

for some reason my driver's seat was broken in two places midway up that
back rest. tomas had the fellers weld those breaks back together; they
padded, and covered both front seats; and reused the original orange westy
vinyl on the flip side. he also padded the back rest with &quot;ribs&quot; for extra
comfort at no extra charge. 75 bucks. 6/7/93. it took an hour and a half in
the middle of the day...before siesta. good, safe neighborhood. next time
down, i'm bringing my stockpile of original orange fabric.
