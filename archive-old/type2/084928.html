Subject: RE: [T2] exhaust questions.

Um - then why does my '78 2.0 with '73 heat exchangers and tin works so 
good....

Not poking at you - just that your statement is 180 degrees out from 
everything I've read and heard which says if you have all the old '72-'74 
parts and tin that it is a bolt on conversion...

At 08:58 PM 5/9/02 -0400, you wrote:
&gt;if your engine is a 78, then its a 2L, and the heat exchanger wont fit, the
&gt;flange are not the same.   If you have an engine from 1700-1800cc then it
&gt;will be okay
&gt;
&gt; From 76 to 83 they made 2 liter engine with different exhaust than 72-75,
&gt;the 2 liter flange are flat and before that they were embossed!
&gt;
&gt;Other option is to switch head from a 1700-1800cc but im not sure as many
&gt;thing are different like hydraulic lifeter ....

Also the heads don't dictate the lifter style used - it's a pushrod length 
thing. The heads don't know or care about the lifters. I think the pushrods 
are a different length for hydraulic and solid lifters. It's a drop in 
conversion except that the camp ought to be renewed at the same time and 
for that you have to split the block.

Anyone want to set me straight if I'm wrong?
