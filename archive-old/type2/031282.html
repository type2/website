&gt; easily (I discovered this when I bumped it once).  I don't know if that means
&gt; somebody has been in there tinkering with it already, or if the silicon

the AFM covers from Bosch are real dogs to get off, so if yours came off
easy I would bet someone has been putzing with it and that could throw
your emissions off
