    Ok, I'm splitting hairs here, but don't forget some special =
applications
such as racing cams may be installed in an advanced or retarded =
position.
Also some cams have split lobe center-line timing between the intake and
exhaust. Now just for laughs don't forget engines with an odd number of
cylinders, such as the Audi five cylinder.
    Just bored and trying to start trouble on a hot afternoon. :-)
