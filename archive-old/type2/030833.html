Subject: Adjusting hydraulic lifters?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.HPP.3.95.981120225813.28531A-100000_at_snake.cs.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;

I know, I know.  Everyone says you don't need to adjust hydraulic lifters,
but I want to check 'em anyway.  I know how to do it on a solid lifter
beastie, but how are those hyrdaulics adjusted. 

I am doing this because I think that I am hearing lifter noise.  its a '73
bus, but it has been retrofitted with a 2000cc hydraulic with lifters,
engine.
