Hi Everyone,
Well just 2 weeks away till I move into my new rental house which may
make not want to use the westy only 200 yards from the lake but I have a
3 car garage so I'm going to go through the westifaction process turning
my 1981 vanagon into a westy. My dad is a welding rep so I can have any
welder I want to use. So to the people who have do this what is the best
and easiest to use. The person who will do the welding has been welding
for like 10 years and my dad said SHE is one of the best welders in the
area but she just go laid off so she has no equipment but that can be
easily solved. So what should I have him get me? He has his recommended
ones but I thought some of you may know better with this bus stuff even
though metal is metal. Can't wait to start even the new land lord is
going to help :) Thanks
Kevin
80 Westy
81 Vanagon soon to be westy
