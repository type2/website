&gt; &gt; Well, it can't be closer than two feet to the exhaust port and also

&gt; &gt; be close to the tip of the exhaust.
&gt;
&gt; Why not? I've read the Bosch LSU sensors can withstand 800F and mine
&gt; is mounted less than 2 ft. from the exhaust port where it's 500F.

I was thinking of a type 1 exhaust where there isn't any pipe 2 feet long!

The numbers I stated were from the SDS website.  I figured that they knew
of what they spoke.
