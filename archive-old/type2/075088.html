Subject: Re: [T2] Insulation Ideas

Try a product called Reflectix.  I'm living in Alberta, Canada &amp; it's
freezing here.  Not like the pussy Tenessee/Southern US freezing (you'd all
perish here).  My whole bus is fitted with this product which is amazing as
its totally flexible, never rots and can be cut &amp; made into any shape with
simple sissors.
Product is available at any Home Depot (yukkk)

Caio &amp; good luck

Subject: [T2] Insulation Ideas


&gt; Greetings All,
&gt;
&gt; The Duck is going in to get a paint job next month and I am in the process
of
&gt; removing most everything from the shell.  I pulled out the tarboards from
the
&gt; engine compartment and I got to wondering..................surely there
must
&gt; be a better insulator than these *%^&amp;$#_at_ tarboards.
&gt;
&gt; Recently when I was down in San Francisco I met a fellow Busser.  He had
&gt; removed the tarboard and placed some sort of foil faced solid insulation
in
&gt; its place.  The pieces were sealed on the edge and the whole effect was
that
&gt; of a professional job.  The metal tabs used to hold the tarboards were
bent a
&gt; little lower to hold this new insulation.  Pretty spiffy.  Clod that I am,
I
&gt; didn't ask him about that at the time.
&gt;
&gt; Basically I'm looking for something rigid (I don't think I want to do the
&gt; floppy NASA stuff like Matt Bulley did), non flammable, and resistant to
&gt; chemicals which will insulate both for heat and sound.  I know others must
&gt; have conquered this little problem in the past.  Suggestions for materials
or
&gt; resources?
&gt;
&gt; TIA,  Mike
&gt;
