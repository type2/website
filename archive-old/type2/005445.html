    I am posting to both lists because my bus falls into both categories. I
have a 70 with a 1600cc dual port engine. This morning when I cranked him
up, there was a funny, almost 'rubbing' sound. (It sounds very much like the
sound my 68 made when its generator died.)
    I have an alternator that was out in, brand-new, 2 years ago this month.
The sound is definitely coming from the engine compartment, and you can hear
it and out of gear, but it is very faint. In fact, unless you drove him
everyday like I do, you would probably not even notice the sound.
    I know it is a longshot to get any advice on a sound that none of you
can hear, but I thought I would give it a try anyway.

Thanks for the time,
