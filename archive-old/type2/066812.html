&gt; the heat exchangers, and a boost blower up front.
&gt; I will prob start with the front blower, just to get some
&gt; defrostability. I dont need heat, but I do need volume.
&gt; I dont like to PULL air in a heat exchanger setup, though.

Sounds pretty much exactly like what I have planned... 

&gt; BTW, are you going to switch the power or use a variable
&gt; resistor. Those fans are LOUD at full speed.

Interesting - I was going to switch it, but using a variable resistor
might be a nice option - of course, I can't remember ever wanting
anything but MORE heat out of my bus... :)

I'll keep you posted - please do the same!
