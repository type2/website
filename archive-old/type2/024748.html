Hello,

Is the seal out?  If not, then you will not be able to see the oil
slinger tube which extends back into the differential section
of the gearbox.  Sometimes these slinger tubes can come 
loose and ride on the input shaft.  Since they are just a press
fit into the bellhousing you can take a long piece of water pipe
and rap them back into place.  If still loose then some good 
ol' JB Weld should secure it.  After securing the slinger tube
then install a new input shaft seal and, in the post-71's with
the later throw out bearings, reinstall the T/O bearing support
tube.
