Subject: Re: [T2] Hagerty Insurance

Shaggy,

Been discussed many times.  Check the archives....
Find a different insurance company.

Farmers Insurance(been there 30+ years)  insures all my cars(don't ask, 
too many).  Last bill showed my status as &quot;ultra preferred&quot;...

I have agreed value $12,000 full coverage on my bus and $7,000 on another 
antique vehicle.  Basically, I had to provide a professional appraisal 
and then was done.  My agent and I worked out the details and I went on my 
way.  No mileage limitations...doesn't matter if they are in a heated 
garage or not, but they *are* *in* a garage.  No restrictions on when I 
drive it....Sure was fun the last two years getting the Christmas tree in 
the bus!  Made me feel like a Norman Rockwell drawing

You can get comprehensive insurance, you just need to call around.  My 
agent was hesitant at first but after calling the home office, he 
understood what was required.  And the home office had to ok the policy
even after he sent it in.

You might also check your home owners insurance agent and ask if it is 
covered while it sits in the garage.

I asked the same sort of question about what if a tree fell on it while it 
sat in the drive way...IIRC, homeowners covers it....as long as the tree 
was not dead and I knew it.

Oh, BTW, be sure and ask you agent to define what comprehensive 
means...pretty much an &quot;act of God(or nature)&quot;....covers deer, dogs, etc.

Oh, and be sure and add the ultra cheap full glass coverage...$10.00/year 
for $100 deductible on any glass breakage.

Cheers, dave
