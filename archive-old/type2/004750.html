Hi all!

I'm new to the list and could use some advice.  This Sunday I will be
checking out (and possibly buying!) a 1971 Pop-Top Camper.  I am told it's
in great shape.  Can anyone tell me what things I should look for
(good/bad/otherwise), beyond the obvious?  I have ALWAYS wanted a bus, but
admittedly know little about them.  Any and all help would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg.
