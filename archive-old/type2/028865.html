I put hose clamps on ALL of my hoses.

Hi everyone,
So, I hop in the '78 Riviera bus yesterday a.m. to go to the airport and she
fires up, then promptly dies.  I tried a couple of more times, and it sounds
like it is being choked out.  I look in back and all the hoses had become
disconnected!  Wierd!  And I was just driving it the previous night, albeit
fast (70mph).  I reconnected the hoses and all is well.
