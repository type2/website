Subject: My Kingdom for a Lug Wrench...

Hey man, where would I find a simple lug wrench that
would fit my lugs? I feel stupid even asking this, but
I don't know what size lugs I have.

I really don't want a 4 way as I have one and just
want a simple &quot;L&quot; shaped one that I can use my hub cap
remover with.

Thanks!

-J
