Subject: '79 3/4 exhaust manifold - free to listee in need
Message-Id: &lt;199903291146.DAA21672_at_helix.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

I have a '79 manifold for the 3/4 head. Thought I could use it with the 
'79 head I installed on my '76 engine -- until I saw that the studs were 
assymetrical and I couldn't turn it around (I modified my '76 manifold 
with a hacksaw and some grinding).

So I have a leftover manifold to give away, if someone needs it. The tin 
wrapped around it is there, though not in pristine condition.

First reply gets it. Please do not reply just to horde the part. I would 
prefer to give it to someone to keep their bus on the road. If nobody 
responds, I will repost and horders will be welcome.
