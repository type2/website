Subject: RE: GL4, Redline?

Hi Tom,

Todd Hill, when he was active here in the past, recommend the Redline
synthetic... and he was also big on using GL4 (and not using GL5).  This was
with the two transaxles I had him build for me (1967 and earlier style).

Anyway, from what I understand, it is sulfur that is of concern... GL5 has
it... sulfur and brass (the synchro sliders).

I also have found other VW Transaxle rebuilders to endorse Redline... here
is a message from the Archives that might be of interest:

I say go for it on the Redline... especially if you can afford it :)  Me, I
went with the Sta-Lube GL4 stuff... cheaper... I like more frequent changes
to check condition of transaxle (shavings, gear teeth, and so forth on
magnet).  Barb&amp;Eric made this point very well in this Archive message:
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\vintagebus_at_type2\Y1999\March\1360

Hope this helps.

Subject: GL4, Redline?


Hi Bussers,
I have a question regarding GL4 tranny oil and compatibility with with 
Redline synthetic oil.  A couple of years ago a mechanic did nose cone work 
on my 70 Westy transmission and changed the gear oil.  He used Redline 
synthetic and said it was great stuff.  Now I wonder if it is ok for my 
tranny.  Does anyone know if this oil is compatible with GL4?  I'm assuming 
it's a 90 weight.  I can't located a parts store that carries it to check.  
The shop that did the work is not around any more.  Thanks for any feedback.

Thanks,
Tom Riis
