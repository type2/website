&gt; Hey guys,

&gt; 	I was told that some of you here are lock smiths and that you would
&gt; be able to (for a fee) re-key my sliding and hatch door of my bus with the
&gt; same keys that I now have for my front door handles. I just ordered a NEW
&gt; set of door handles with matching keys for the front.

Rekeying isn't all that much of a trick.  All you have to do is remove the
cylinders and swap the wafers around to match the key you have.  Work on a
clean smooth surface (you don't want to find those little springs in shag
carpet!) and keep a key in the lock while disassembling to keep the wafers
in place
