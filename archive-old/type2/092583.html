&gt;A 912 and a 356 engine are essentially the same as VW engines with some

Boy are you off the mark. The 912/356 motors are nothing like either the 
Beattle or T-IV motors, other than being horizontally opposed and air 
cooled. By 1955, the Porsche motor used but a few bits of hardware that was 
the same as VW. Everything of consequence is different. The later 
iterations put out 50% more horsepower in stock trim than any VW T-IV. The 
biggest obstacle with fitting these motors in a T-II has to do with the 
custom tinwork needed to seal the motor compartment along with custom 
engine/tranny mounts and adapting bigger CV's/axles for the extra torque. 
Then you will really have some fun swapping gears to get the torque band to 
work well pushing twice as much weight. The Porsche motor has a much longer 
stroke and wider power band, but to find a good harmony of gears for the 
Porshce engine and tranny to work well with the Bus load will add to the 
cost in time/money for the experiment.
