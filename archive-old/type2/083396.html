Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pump on 1800 

The fuel injestion pump is high pressure a pump for carbs would only be a
few psi. So if you still have the FI pump in there without some sort of
pressure regulator it would be a problem.

&gt; My '75 has an 1800 pancake motor in it that was fuel injection once upon a
&gt; time, but was converted to dual carbs by one of my predecessors.  I am having
&gt; a problem with flooding, and am wondering if it is the fuel pump.  Should it
&gt; still be electric?  Or should I replace it with something else?  Gee, can you
&gt; guess my knowledge is limited?
