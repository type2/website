Subject: can't figure out where this hose goes!

HI everybody,
 
While trying to get through some stuff to make my 76 bus pass smog I ran
across a small hose underneath my bus that had been cut and had a screw
stuck in it.
From what I can tell it has something to do with the fuel injection, but
I am unable to determine where it should connect.  When I take the screw
out it sucks air.  Also it is a side shoot of a larger hose that goes
into what I think is the fuel injection part of the engine.  When I pull
this hose out of the socket the engine dies.  Does anyone know what this
hose is or have any suggestions how I can figure out what it is.  I have
3 VW manuals and even using these I am unable to determine what the hose
is.  If anyone can help me I sure would appreciate it. 
 
Thanks,
 
Phillip B. Rose
