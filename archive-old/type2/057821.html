I sent this message list week but I think it got lost in the server problems
so I am sending it again. Sorry if you have already seen it.

I just uploaded a new page on combatting rust and repairing a rusty window
frame.

I had do an emergy repair because the window broke and that revealed some
rust. I did not really want to start on such a job with the very limited
welding
experience that I have but under the circumstances I thought I would give it
a try.

Have a look at my website  if you are interested.
