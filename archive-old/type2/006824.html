Subject:      If it ain't air-cooled...

  I would like to thank Ken for not killing this thread before it had run it's
course. I would also like to thank my producer and the members of the
Academy....
  But seriously volks,  I would like to thank all of you who responded to my
little diatribe against the water-cooled VW's. It has been gray and rainy
around here lately and I was getting very bored with the uninspired content of
the postings lately. Mike West's contributions have been the only ray of
sunshine in the ether for sometime now, so I thought I might spice up the
activities with a little divisive dissertation. I was not disappointed! For the
most part, the responses indicated a level of awareness and insight that might
not be expected from a bunch of motor-heads, but then these are VW motor-heads,
and computer geeks to boot. There was a little bit of name calling, but then I
expected more than I got. There was none of the &quot;Air-cooleds rule, dude!&quot; ,
indicating a surprising lack of adolescents (of whatever age) in this group. In
particular I appreciated those who defended my right to express an opinion,
whether they agreed or not.
  I must admit that this whole line originated from an atavistic corner of my
brain that rebels against the fact that we have come to live in a world were a
simple, basic little vehicle like the VW can no longer be produced and
marketed. It is an analogy for all of the other things in our lives upon which
we depend, but can no longer understand or control. Living in California, I
find that we are faced with the prospect of government legislating our vehicles
off the road. So, to those of you who questioned which world I live in, it's
the same one as the rest of you, but I don't have to like it.
   Regarding my stand on maintaining the &quot;stockness&quot; of VW's, I regard them as
vehicles to be preserved as well as used. My '63 Crew-cab has a freeway geared
transaxle, 12 v system with alternator, full instrumentation, and halogen
headlamps, a 2110 hydraulic motor with dual Weber 40IDF's (I am looking
seriously at CB's fuel injection) and Pertronix Ignitor. The heater system has
been upgraded with dual blowers from Barney's (and works very well, thank-you).
The bed has been lined with polished aluminum diamond plate all around and a
rubber mat on the bottom to make it practical to actually carry stuff in it. At
the same time, I have gone to great lengths to maintain the stock appearance.
It is stock height, with the correct 15 in. bus wheels and hubcaps. The bumpers
are stock and complete. All of the exterior and interior features are as stock
as is practical for a daily driver. My Karmann Ghia is a slightly different
story, after 18 years pursuing a similar approach (stock appearance with
whatever improvements current technology will permit) I think I am going to
take a major detour and convert it to an electric vehicle. I am an old,
unrepentant hippie with a long suppressed desire to do something ecologically
correct, practicality be damned!
  Well, I have rambled on long enough. I hope I didn't offend anyone to
severely and I trust you all will allow me to continue to participate in this
great group.
Thanks again and thanks to Ken for the bandwidth.
