&gt; I've got a pair of heat exchangers off an 83 Air cooled and also have the
&gt; crossover pipe in good shape with a good catalytic converter on it. You'd
&gt; need to purchase a new muffler and the short tail pipe.
&gt; P-mail  me for details.
&gt; It would ship from Dallas TX 75220 and both heat exchangers and the
&gt; crossover would weigh in at about 70 Pounds and pack in two cartons.
&gt; Go here to get your UPS charges

&gt;
&gt; *switch to either a '72-74 or '79-83 system (best solution, solves the
&gt; problem for good, but requires replacement of the heat exchangers).*


The heat exchangers won't work on a '75-78.  The exhaust will, but the heat
exchangers he needs are the '72-74 ones.
