Subject: RV &amp; Marine Battery?

I want to buy a battery tomorrow for my Westy for a second battery when
camped, I could use advice on what to buy and where to buy it.

I looked at the Optima Blue top and Yellow top, both close to $200.00, I can
do this if it really is the best option, but it sure is a lot of money, the
Baxter Auto Parts by my house also sells an Exide knock-off of the Optima Blue
top for 20 bucks less.

Could I use something totally different and considerably cheaper of do I just
go pay $200.00 for an Optima?

Thanks,
James in Portland, Oregon
