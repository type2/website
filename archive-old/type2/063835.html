Subject: New Zealand List Meet!

All,
        CCCs eat your hearts out.  Yes, the entire New Zealand list 
gathered in Christchurch this evening.  Both William Warburton and 
myself(Gary Gibson) met.  We are the NZ list.  We met with his partner Judy 
and her sister  Sally at the Dux de Lux for the Dux's own brew, good 
local jazz and Type 2 talk.  Interestingly enough, none of us are Kiwis and 
we are all leaving New Zealand for otherplaces soon.  William showed me 
his wheels, a '68 Doormobile that he bought in Wellington.  The 
Doormobile is a brilliant camper!  My '66 Westy has no camping class 
compared to the Door.  I mean my '66 is a good '66, but have you all 
checked out the Doormobiles?  British luxury liners!
Gary Gibson
