&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont think you could use a chassis punch to cut through the composite

&gt; &gt; hmmmm, mine is sharp enough to cut me, but I would put the cutter part
&gt; &gt; (and mine is designed that way) on the inside and pull through the steel

&gt; 
&gt; Well, I think that if you do it this way you would really crush/crack the
&gt; foam with the larger diameter base part of the punch.  Better to carefully
&gt; cut the hole through the foam first and then to punch the hole with the
&gt; cutter from the outside.

yeah your probably right, haven't done it and didn't think it through,
these things are expensive and I have em for other things haven't used em
on my dash, have all my guages on top and extra switches in the ash tray
space with matching plastic filler.  (don't smoke and discourages the
smokers)
