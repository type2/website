Subject: Re: [T2] Couple Questions (doors, cold engine)

&gt;My first question is about cold starting. It starts alright, but idles
&gt;terribly when first started. Will idle for 10 secs and die. Also, if you put
&gt;it in gear, and try to take off, or even just rev the engine with the gas
&gt;pedal, it will die instantly. As soon as you touch the gas pedal, the only
&gt;luck I've had is if I put it in gear before I start it, start it a couple
&gt;times and just go, let the cluch out and floor it. It will chug for a
&gt;second, etc.

Have you followed the starting instructions? They explain when to press the pedal and how to activate the fast idle linkage which often make a big difference to an otherwise perfectly tuned carb:
