&gt; &gt; &gt; Which brings up a question. I never ever have had to

&gt; &gt; Most chains come in a bag or box that has a list of tire sizes printed on
&gt; &gt; it.  The proof of the pudding is whether it fits or not in your driveway!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I say driveway becuase this is the first plsce you should try them.  Don't
&gt; &gt; leave it to when you are trying to mount them in a blizzard with wet slush
&gt; &gt; tricking down your arms and onto your pants!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you really want to do it right, get an extra spare tire and carry the
&gt; &gt; chains already mounted on the spares.  It's a lot easier to swap wheels
&gt; &gt; than it is to put chains on.
&gt; 
&gt; has anyone tried the &quot;automatic chains&quot;?  around here the fire dept uses
&gt; em. I have looked at em to fit my van. not cheap but flip a switch on the
&gt; dashboard and you have chains, flip it back and they are gone
