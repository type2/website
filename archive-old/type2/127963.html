&gt;     The oil pressure switch has a special kind of thread called  &quot;pipe

&gt; peaks of the threads do not reach all the way to the bottoms of the valleys
&gt; of the female pipe threads. However, as you get to the other end of the pipe
&gt; threads, they get &quot;longer&quot; or &quot;taller&quot; . 

This isn't exactly correct either. NPT has all threads cut the same
depth. The difference is that they are cut on (or into) the piece at a
taper. A very exagerated view of this is a pencil point when
sharpened. It was cut at a taper. The threads just follow this taper.
