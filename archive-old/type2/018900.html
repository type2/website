&gt; We need to replace the clutch in our '72 Bus.  It slips
&gt; after it gets hot, but otherwise is fine.  We have a parts
&gt; '72 Bus, but it appears to have a Type IV car engine, not a
&gt; proper Bus engine.  Would the clutches and pressure plates
&gt; be the same between these two engines?

Dave:
VERY few 411's and 412's had manual transmissions, so it's likely that
the 72 parts bus has a bus clutch anyhow. However, new discs are so
cheap (and that IS the main part that wears out), that I'd seriously
just consider a new disc. Unless the clutch is worn to the point where
it's REALLY slipping a lot, the pressure plate is probably not worn
much.
