Subject: Re: Evaporative engine cooling

Use the canvas bags that water cooled cars used to hang in front of their
radiators.  Hang one on each side of the engine compartment where the air
comes down from the external intakes.  It wouldn't be optimal, but it would
be a cheap way to check out evaporative cooling on your engine.  If you try
the bags, remember:  Saturate before using.

Another take on this idea would be to use the existing airflow.  The airflow
through the channels below the external air intakes might be enough to
create a vacuum.  Imagine the air channel as a very large carb throat.  A
fitting placed inside the channel could be piped to a water chamber.  The
water chamber would have two openings.  An inlet with an extension that went
to the bottom of the water chamber, and the other one at the top of the
chamber that ran to the engine air intake channels.  The vacuum would suck
air through the intake into the water chamber, it would bubble up, creating
a mist, said mist would be pulled through the piping into the engine
compartment.  A system like this would have no moving parts and would use
water at a fairly consistent and reasonable rate.  It also might work on the
engine itself, piping into the air cleaner.  What diameter fittings and
pipes to be effective?  I have no idea.

&gt; 
&gt; This question strictly concerns the arid southwest and other parts of the
&gt; world where the air temperature rises over 100F and the relative humidity
&gt; is well below 50%.
&gt; 
&gt; If you put a misting system in the air intakes for the engine
&gt; compartment, that should result in the equivalent of a 20F drop in
&gt; ambient temperature from the perspective of the engine's cooling system.
&gt; And that might just be enough to keep the driver's blood pressure at
&gt; reasonable levels while driving through the desert and monitoring the oil
&gt; temps.
&gt; 
&gt; The trick is to optimize the system. There would be a water tank
&gt; (installed under the floor), a water pump, connecting hoses, and the
&gt; misting loops inside the intakes. To keep water consumption at a
&gt; manageable level, though, it would be necessary to optimize the mist by
&gt; controlling the output. One way to do that would be to have an
&gt; intermitant switch to the pump. Another would be to emulate the FI
&gt; system by running the pump constantly and installing an &quot;injector&quot; that
&gt; would pulse at some determined rate. And finally, one could simply
&gt; optimize the &quot;jets&quot; that put out the mist, while running the system
&gt; constantly.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
