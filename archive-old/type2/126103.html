Bolt on improvements seldom are. Everything he suggests is possible but only if the engine is completely reconfigured.

The Vanagon has a pretty low deck. Will dual carbs even fit inside the engine compartment?

&gt;Why would VW change over to FI if it isn't as efficient?

FI is the best system for a stock bus engine. You are entering a world of hurt if you throw away a working FI system.
