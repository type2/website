Subject: Door panels

Hey all!
As I was going through my various catalogs pricing items
we would like to add to our '74 bus, I came to realize
that $415 seems like a lot to change the panels from
brown to black. So I am asking, does anyone have GOOD
black door panels for a '74 bus for sale? (pretty sure 
'68-79 will work) 

We are also looking for the sliding door handle and mechanism as
well as the passenger door handle.
        I also found out that my body work and paint connection
is closing and will only accept insurance work from now until
they close. :( Oh well, I already have several other leads on
guys with good reps and reasonable prices.

That's all for now folks...........Chip
