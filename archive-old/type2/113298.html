Subject: Rear Hatch?

Has anybody ever replaced the copper bushings in the rear hatch hinges? I have 
mine apart and was wondering where one might get these bushings? I've seen 
copper bushings (generic) at the local parts houses but never compared them to 
the ones in my hinges because I've never had my bushings out and I really just 
discovered the bushings the other day.

Also has any body ever found any beefeier hatch springs?
