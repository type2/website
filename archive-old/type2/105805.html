&gt; Has anyone on the list dealt with this Bluebird company out of England? They

I have heard only good reports about Bluebird, no bad.  You might like to
visit the Just Kampers forums at
http://www.justkampers.co_dot_uk/interactive/kamperchat/index.php and do a
search on &quot;bluebird&quot; - there are plenty of comments.

I am hoping to buy one of their stainless exhausts soon to go on my new
engine.
