Subject: Re: [T2] Right hand conversion

The opinions of the folks who know more than I is to stay away from Teflon products in your engine. Teflon they say belongs on your frying pan, not in your oil. LOTS to read about this on the web. Just search for &quot;Oil additives&quot;+FAQ on Google. Dupont (who invented Teflon) says do not use Teflon in your engine. 

As for the RHD conversion, I looked seriously into it about 10 years ago on my Beetle. Basically you need a parts van. Requires - among others - the pedals, the front beam (or front been modified with brackets reversed), dash, and the windshield wipers reversed. In our case the nose SKIN might need to be replaced if the wipers come out of raised sheet metal nubs.

Next comes the wiring harness if the fuse box is reversed on RHD drive vehicles or at least the dash wiring extended to match up to the stock harness. Also the stock harness on my '78 comes down the passenger side and might interfere with the steering or pedals on a RHD vehicle. Also does the floor pan have specific stampings for RHD vehicles? 

Hope this points you in the right direction. 

Take care!
