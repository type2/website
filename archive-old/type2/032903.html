Subject: Looking for pristine '76-'79 Westy

A friend from Montreal would like to enter the Westy world, but is looking
for a particularly nice and reliable vehicle that will not require further
investments for a while. Body, engine, and other mechanics should be in top
condition. Ideally, the Westy should be from '78 because of the hydraulic
lifters, but any model with the '76-'79 interior layout will be considered.
He is willing to travel and is willing to pay the premium for an exceptional
vehicle.

Thank you,

Sami
