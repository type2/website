Hang in there. I think we need to start a list of people to no longer trust 
in business deals.

I just sent $90 to Orlando hoping the fellow will do me right. I feel good 
about the deal, but how do you ever know???

In my own dealings, the people I have met from the list and others (the 914 
and Corvair lists) have been top notch people.

I think the best thing we can all do is publish when we have good dealings 
and bad. It will eventually identify the good guys and bad.

Offer one more chance for the individual and then embarrass the hell out of 
the guy.

Maybe our gracious List Admin could bar these bad guys from the list? Of 
course how could you verify the accusations? Or when possible, use a 
trusted contact local to one of transaction parties to hold the parts or 
the money until the transaction was completed...

Ship COD?









&gt;I just spent $7000 resurrecting my '76 Type two. I still need many
&gt;parts, and have some extra around. Recently I talked with a member of
&gt;this list, and sent him a brake vaccuum unit I had to go tear off of a
&gt;junked car. I spent 1.5 hours taking it off, and $9.50 to send it to
&gt;him. So far I have gotten squat back except thank yous and promises of
&gt;the shipping costs in the mail.
&gt;
&gt;I sent it with hopes of 'good karma' and being part of the 'bus
&gt;brotherhood' but have only received feeling like a used idiot in return.
&gt;I know this is probably only an isolated incident, but it shapes my
&gt;future actions. Hell, I got my bus from a past list member, and he had
&gt;no problem concealing the problems with this bus so he could sell it.
