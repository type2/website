Subject: Southern Busses Fer Sale?

Howdy-do, Volks!

A friend of mine is a big-time wannabusser.  On top of this, 
his present car is for sale, and he will soon be sans transport
.  We are trying to hunt him a bus, ANY variety, preferably
in good shape (he wants it to at least get him back and forth 
to work...)  We were thinking early V-gon, but I think he'd
pounce on any reasonable deal.  Oh, yeah... We're in Knoxville, 
Tennessee.  Has to be reasonable drive time from here.

TIA,

Blake, owner of the '69 Westy, named 'Edith Ann' just recently
