Subject: A special thanks

Hi Volks -list treasurer here. I would like to thank Troy Wical for his
generosity in funding the list. As you all know, the list is funded solely
by your generous contributions. Well, Troy has, on numerous occasions, sold
parts and for payment requested that the money be donated to the
Type/Vintagebus lists. I know that times are tough and donations have
tapered off in this past year, this is a great way to fund the list. If
anyone else wants to do this, it'll be great.

The only thing that I ask is that you let me know who get what and I will
let you know when the donation gets here so that you can ship the part.....

Again, thank you all for your support... Ted Finesman (the cherry guy), list
treasurer.

Don't take life to seriously -- you'll never live throught it....
