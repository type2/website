Subject: Re: [T2] New headliner vs. old headliner, the measurments

David,

If the measurements on the one that I got from TMI had been that close
I probably would have been ok with it.  My headliner was so far off that 
the ribs where the dome lights actually showed when the headliner was 
stretched.

I suspect that the rear on yours  may be just fine.  Test fit yours first 
without doing any gluing.  I found that the wide &quot;welding&quot; vice grips with some 
vinyl glued on them were perfect for holding each end before gluing.  Also
the wooden woodworking clamps worked great also.  You *need* two people!

I think I explained how to test fit in one of those posts you looked at so 
that you start at the rear and work forward.

Cheers, dave
