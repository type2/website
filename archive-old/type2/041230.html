Subject: Re: Break, Brake, Broke.

Oh had I only seen this message Friday.  I spent all weekend in the Seattle
rain banging, prodding pulling, bleeding, cussing and fussing with my
brakes.  I spent almost as much time going to different shops for parts as
the ones I kept getting were not the right ones.  Apparently 1972 buses are
a one of a kind year for brakes shoes.  Cotter pins were too short, c clamps
were missing/rusted too or the wrong size, the breaker bar broke, etc. etc.
ex nauseating cetera.

I managed to round out the bleeder valves on my new wheel cylinders a bit,
might need to go through and redo all the bearings and seals on both axles,
and after all the adjusting sputtering and such.  The frickin breaks still
don't work right.  I think the master cylinder is shot.  The brakes still
need to be pumped in order to get them to work and the e-brake couldn't stop
a square from rolling around a perfectly flat mesa.   Aarrghh!!!

Anyway, aside from being discouraged, whiny and tired, it was a good
experience.  I worked on my old bug's rear brakes back in '87.  Does anyone
have any good tips on checking/removing/fixing the master cylinder?  How
about adjusting the stars to make the pads fit right?  I can't tell if only
one side is contacting the drums or if both are poorly.  Any thoughts?  I
think the reason the e-brake doesn't work for a darn is because the pads
aren't contacting the drum equally.

I still can't believe that there are NO VW bus owners on this list in the
Seattle area that will trade some advice and knowledge for some help with
their bus.  Oh well.

Discouraged in Seattle.

&gt;&gt; Thanks!  Midas quoted me a ~$500 repair job on the brakes.  They wanted to
&gt;&gt; replace both my rear drums at a meager $99 apiece as well as both wheel
&gt;&gt; cylnders for $60 each.  Of course the shoes were bad too, etc. etc.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Needless to say, I took the quote with the parts list down to my local
&gt;&gt; junkyard and got 2 freshly turned drums, 2 wheel cylnders, 4 new shoes,
&gt;&gt; cotter pins, castle nut removal tool, and a few odds and ends for $100.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'm going to redo my brakes this weekend. I've never fussed with wheel
&gt;&gt; cynders before so it ought to be fun and worrisome!
&gt; 
&gt; Apply your favorite Liquid Wrench analog to all fittings for a couple of
&gt; days before you take it apart.  Be sure to use the correct brake line
&gt; wrenches on the brake lines.  Regular open end wrenches will tend to round
&gt; them off.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that you kept an eye on the fun folks at Midas.  It isn't unknown
&gt; for vehicles to leave Midas with more problems than they came in with.
