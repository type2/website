Subject: RE: [T2] westy options

&gt;I have also heard talk of &quot;weekenders&quot; and &quot;hard top&quot; Westphalia
conversions 
&gt;without the upper loft.  I have also seen what appear to be authentic 
&gt;conversions without the upper rear cabinet.  Are these formal models
offered 
&gt;by Westphalia?  Could you ever order varying degrees of options or are
these 
&gt;simply owner modified/created campers using campers and buses and mixing
and 
&gt;matching standard and deluxe equipment?

All the &quot;weekenders&quot; or &quot;hard top&quot; Westphalias I have seen were early bay
window busses (pre-74) or split window busses.  I have never seen a 74-79
hard top Westphalia camper, although there may be some out there.  The upper
rear cabinet didn't come along until the 76-79 Westphalia.  I have seen many
upper rear cabinets removed from the 76-79 and installed into the 74-75, but
it was standard in 76-79 for all Westphalias.  I can't say for certain, but
I doubt it was even available on the 74-75.  As for ordering varying degress
of options I have never seen a 74-79 Westphalia that appeared to have
anything other than the original standard or original deluxe equipment.
