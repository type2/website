&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'm familiar with the 14mm thermo sensor for cylinder head
&gt;&gt;temperature which fastens (ususally cylinder #3) via spark plug,
&gt;&gt;but I'm wondering if there is any list wisdom/experience on going
&gt;&gt;to the 12mm sensor which would fasten to a head stud instead?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Jim,
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, I installed the 12 mm  head stud sender on my '72 rebuilt and it
&gt;works fine.  The only trick I did was to slightly bend the tang where the
&gt;wire comes off the sender ring so I could direct it through the hole in
&gt;the tin nicely.
&gt;
&gt;I don't have any experience with the spark plug type, but I'm glad for the
&gt;head stud one because it will avoid the slight nuisance of handling the
&gt;sender at tune up time.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck
&gt;
