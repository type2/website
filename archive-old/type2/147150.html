Figured it out, I'm in Canada, and they only certify it for outdoor use.
Different owners manual. The webpage of Mr. Heater, clearly states it is ok
to use indoors. Typical Canadian baloney.

good luck heating your open field at 4000 and 9000 BTUs. The thing looks

identical to the &quot;Handi Heater&quot; thing I have. Mine only requires a small

opening for fresh air venting, which my leaky bus has plenty of. The one

thing that did strike me about yours was that it says it isn't to be used

above 5000 feet in elevation. what the heck is up with that? most of my

camping places are higher than 7500 feet in elevation. Anyway here's

...safe heat for chilly garages, tents, patios, porches, cabins, fishing

shanties (shanties? heh), truck caps (caps? cabs perhaps) and barns and

so on.

 

just provide a little vent for it and you should be fine i would think.

i've not managed to gas my family using mine yet, but i am still trying.

please don't hold me accountable should you be successful in gassing

yours!
