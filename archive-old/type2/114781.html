Subject: Dilemma: To Part or Not To Part...

 I need to sell my 73 Bus with a customized engine because I am moving in
less than two months. 

I am pondering if I should strip it for parts and bring them to a show and
sell them?

Or bring the Bus to the show and try to sell it whole?

Or Drive the Bus to a show and sell parts off of it and then get rid of the
remainder?

Is the value of the parts greater separate Vs Or as a whole Bus?

Robert
