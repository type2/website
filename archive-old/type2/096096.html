&gt; I'm looking for feedback, bouquets or brickbats, on T2 Automatic 
&gt; Transmission. I found a cherry little &quot;weekender&quot;, a  '74 for sale. I 
&gt; was all excited, until I saw the automatic shifter on the floorboard.

having driven and worked on my auto tranny for ten years I guess I can
share what I feel is the good/bad/ugly

&gt; I dont know anything about these. Are they any good? Should I avoid like 
&gt; the plaque? Or are they pretty decent units?

they can be good units, and they do have some advantages
&gt; 
&gt;  I'd appreciate any and all candid opinions from those who may currently 
&gt; have, have had, swear by them or swear at them.

first there are two types of auto tranny and 74 is on the cusp so check to
see what kind you have, the older is the vacuum shift tranny and this will
have a vacuum line from you intake system to a can on the bottom side of
the tranny.  the second newer type is a govenor shift version and it does
not have the vacuum line...the later type with govenor shift is much
better and as the guts of it is the same as the rabbit tranny parts are
somewhat still avaliable.

the good.
. great in city traffic
. next to impossible to lug em or overrev em
. you can put a newer tranny (if you can find one) into the older tranny
spot with very few mods

the bad
. harder to find parts for
. tough but not as tough as the manual

the ugly
. actually lowers the value of the bus
. some folks will turn up thier noses at you 

&gt; At first guestt, and knowing about the hassels of  trying to convert 
&gt; auto-stick to manual in ghias, I assume a conversion is totally out of 
&gt; the question. Correct?

it's been done but it makes the ghia conversion look easy.

personally I like mine and don't mind the little quirks

can you drive it?
any other questions?
