Subject: '76 FI &quot;hiccup&quot; - what the heck?!

Changed oil and filter, used a Fram filter from the FLAPS, 
experienced a series of &quot;hiccups&quot; on the road, momentary loss of 
power, just for half a second, but it got my attention. Maybe a 
dozen of 'em at varying times during a 200-mile roundtrip today to 
LA and back home to San Diego -- is this a dirty injector? ANY 
guesses appreciated, as Mr. Spock used to say, &quot;I have not 
encountered this phenomenon before&quot; and it's bugging me... THANKS!
