Subject: Manifold to exhaust nuts &amp; bolts

Hi Type 2ers,

I still need to install my exhaust to the engine before I put it in my
bus. I misplaced these nuts though, everything was in little plastic
bags except these nuts and bolts. I have looked through the archives but
came up with only information for Type 4 manifold/exhaust systems. I
have a ' 71 dual port. What size nuts and bolts are used for attaching
the manifold to the exhaust, and what size nuts are used to attach the
exhaust to the the heads?

Thanks,

Max Bronsema
