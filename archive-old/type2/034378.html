Subject: re bike shop as heatercable source.

In regards to bike shop as a source for cable to control heater flaps
-for the cable from the thermostat:  Brake cable is too fat- use SHIFTER
cable with the teardrop end suaged on the end- you must cut it to length
AFTER you snake it through that _at_^_at_$#%$ hard to see/reach hole in the
tin above the thermostat!  I alway solder the cut end so it won't fray.
(Biked across country when I had a life before VW busses!)
