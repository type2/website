Subject: Converting a Westy Icebox 
Message-ID: &lt;38020775.6742_at_bellatlantic_dot_net&gt;

I have a 1974 Westy whose Dometic gave up the ghost a few years ago. It
was replaced with an icebox from a wrecked Westy in a salvage yard.

There are different models (such as Coolatron, Coleman etc.) of portable
coolers that use a thermoelectric module (heat sink) type of cooling
mechanism that are relatively inexpensive when compared to a new
Dometic. Has any one found a module cooling unit that could be mounted
in a Westy icebox? The result would be a dual source unit with 12v
supplying cooling while traveling and thereby extending the life of the
ice block and then while camping the ice block would continue to cool
while the engine is off. When in a campground hooked to 110v the adapter
that is sometimes supplied with the cooler would continue electrical
operation. There appears to be sufficient space at the rear of the
icebox for the module robbed from a cooler,fan,and necessary air flow.

Thanks,

Sam
