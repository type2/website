Subject: Anyone going to King Biscuit Blues Festival?

--part1_44.267d052e.2ac10fa9_boundary

Hey there... just wondering if anyone else is planning to go the the King 
Biscuit Blues Festival in Helena, Arkansas (about 50 miles south of 
Memphis)... It's the biggest FREE blues festival in the South... Three days 
of music October 10-12...

You can check the lineup at 

http://www.kingbiscuitfest_dot_org/

This is the festival's 17th year - it will be my 7th year to go... It's 
always been a great time... I did mention that it's FREE?  Camping is also 
available for a reasonable charge within walking distance of all the stages 
(the fire department runs the campground as a fundraiser)... last year I 
think it was something like $40-45 per vehicle for the full three nights...

Just wondering if anyone else is going... I'd love to meet some of you... 
(and no, I don't have any personal connection with the festival)...
