Brazil Kombi:
http://www.vw_dot_com.br/4545.asp

Based on several reports, they are using a fuel injected 1600 AS41 case
engine.  I am trying to get a price on one of the engines.

For reference, Brazil has taken some hard financial hits of late -- but
there currency hasn't changed radically.  The BR 18,044 comes out to
US$15,000 at today's  exchange rate.

Anyone have ideas as to what they are using for a transxale?  I presume a 4
speed, but which one (gearing and so forth)?

Wonder if the inside is similar to our 1972 - 1979?  Middle seat, etc.
