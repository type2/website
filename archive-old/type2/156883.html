&gt; The Guac has been feeling like it's misfiring at all

&gt; especially when not at
&gt; full throttle it's just rough.

&gt; Checked the dwell. 90*. I thought, &quot;Ah ha!&quot; But it
&gt; was not to be. I pulled
&gt; the distributor and reset the points. I set at 18*
&gt; just do see what dwell
&gt; I'd get and adjust from there. Rubbing block was
&gt; fine. But when I put it
&gt; back together and fired it up, I still got 90*. I
&gt; revved the engine to see

Condensor? Tach? Sometimes internal short in the
points assembly. Sometimes the wires inside the
distributor that have to flex as the base plate
rotates (advance) sometimes those wires work harden
and the insulation fails - usually very intermittant
though. Did you bring an extra coil with you?:o)
