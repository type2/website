Subject: [T2]Best  AIRS Rescue ever! (long)

I have to tell you about the best AIRS rescue ever! On the way to Everybus 2002 I had noticed a little &quot;thump thump&quot; noise from one of my rear tires. I thought that I had a lump or &quot;mud in my tires&quot;. Got to EB02 and had an awesome time. Left northbound with the Jeff Stewart/Canadian carabus. All is well until just south of Lynchburg when I notice that the thump is now big vibrations at lower speeds. We stop to take a look at it and decide that if I baby it and keep at higher speeds I should make it to Round Hill where we can all take a look at her.
The Loveboat decides otherwise. 10 miles later, just north of Lynchburg, I realize that I have to pull over NOW. Took next exit and into a church parking lot with the left rear tire having a very pronounced wobble. Bearings are shot. Pulled out the AIRS list that I had printed just before my trip south and found that Jeff Burks was the closest (at over an hour away). I left him a message and he returned my call in less than 5 minutes. He had a brother within 15 minutes! Better yet, his brother has a fully loaded garage and is a parts supplier!!! 
We take a quick poll of what to do and some of the other drivers offer to stay with me. Then Jeff's brother Ron comes pulling up in his Westy! We all feel relieved that I am in good hands and the carabus leaves. I hobble at less than 10 miles an hour to Ron's shop (about 5 miles away).  Take her apart with Ron's awesome air tools. Inner/outer bearings, seals and a new wheel hub are in order. I have a set. The Canadians had given me a set of bearings that turned out to be for a front wheel,dammit. Jeff shows up and we sit down to a wonderful dinner and decide what to do. Ron worked the phones to his distributor buddies and we found that nobody stocks the outer bearings. Plan B - Make calls in the morning after we sleep on it. Jeff and his wife drove me the 1 hour plus trip to Roanoke where they put me up for the night in his Westy. Slept like a baby. Came in for a cup of coffee and started making calls. Jeff took the day off to help me! No bearings in all of Virginia it appea!
rs. Made a call to Salem Imports where Mark said he had the whole assembly, used. Back in business. Had lunch and went to check out Mark's shop. This was awesome in it's own right! I wanted to move in on the spot. If you ever need any part for any classic VW this is the place to go. Knowlegeable, friendly, fair and tons of parts. We struck our very fair deal and headed back to Lynchburg. Pulled off the old assy and discover a problem. I got the wrong part. It didn't occur to any of us to make sure I got a left assy. Oops. Back to Salem Import. Part is waiting. Back to Lynchburg. Keep in mind that it is an hour plus each way and I am relying on the kindness of a stranger that shares an interest. The brotherhood of busses! Got the part installed well into the night and I was back up and running.
Jeff and his brother went waaaay out of their way to help a busted brother. I cannot tell you the gratitude I feel for he and his families southern hospitality they have shown. If there is an award for the best AIRS rescue ever I would like to nominate Jeff Burks for all the help he has given to me.

Thanks AIRS!
