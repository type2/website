Sounds like the typical problem of not starting that has been resolved time and
again with an auxiliary starter relay, such as the Bosch WR-1 low voltage relay
kit.  Of course, it could be that all the resistance that is preventing you
starter from working properly is in the ignition switch.  I wouldn't worry about
the coil, as it has nothing to do with whether your starter works or not, and if
the bus starts and runs reliably whenever you do get the starter to work, then
the coil is probably fine.

All the suggestions Ken made are very good points and should be checked out
anyway.  On my '64, I replaced the ignition switch, (a very easy job on a
Splittie) and it solved my intermittent cranking problem for a couple years, but
I live in the Redwoods, which is inherently a very damp place for 3 to 9 months
of the year and after a while the intermittency came back.  When the starter was
being stubborn, I couldn't get it to work by hot-wiring at the ignition switch,
but it always cranked if I swung underneath with my trusty screwdriver and
shorted across the battery and solenoid terminals on the starter.  That
screwdriver took the place of my church key in the holder and I got real good at
swinging under the bus and finding the two terminals by feel (light, I don't
need no steenking light to start my bus from underneath).

I did the screwdriver at the starter thing for about six months, when finally, I
happened across the low voltage relay kit at DONSCO, installed it in about half
an hour, and my starter now cranks every time I turn the ignition switch.  When
I first got the relible cranking back, it was always sweet to merely climb into
Sunshine and turn the key to get her to start.  By now the novelty has worn off,
but I will always swear by that auxiliary starter relay.

BTW, I still would condidered replacing/repairing your ignition switch, as it
sounds faulty in any case, and you'll never know what dark and stormy night,
just after the batteries have died in your flashlight and you still haven't
fixed the dome lights, that the switch finally gives up the ghost and fails to
operate at all.

Have fun, 
terry
