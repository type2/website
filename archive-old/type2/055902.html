&gt;There are four suggestions, as fars as I know:
&gt;Don't do anything to the valves - one of my manuals says that.
&gt;Set them to zero clearance - remembering having read this on the list.
&gt;Set them to zero clearance and 1 turn in - remembering having read this 
&gt;on the list.
&gt;Set them to zero clearance and 2 turns in - my other manual says that.

I vote for the last one, 2 turns in.  But, is this a new engine that you
are putting in and trying to initially set up, or are you having problems
like noisy valves?  If not, then I'd go with the first suggestion and do
nothing.  That's the main advantage of hydraulic lifters:  not having to
adjust them.
