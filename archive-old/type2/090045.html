Jeremy,

As westydriver_at_mac_dot_com said, the lower one is there as a drain, for when
you are flushing the system.  If you pull fluid from the top only, the
fluid in the lower part does get replaced.  I was also told (possible old
mechanics tale coming) that the lower bleeder was for priming new
calipers.  Take your choice, it does not matter, you only have to bleed
thru the top bleeder.

&gt; Aslo, the sears vaccuum hand pump i bought says i should start with the
&gt; bleeder valve closest to the master cyl (left front), but the idiot book
&gt; says start with the one furthest from the master cyl (Right Rear). Which is
&gt; correct?

I've seen this and I don't believe it.  Maybe it is a suction vs. pressure
thing, but I am an old fart and very traditiion bound :-)  I always start,
as Muir does, at the wheel furthest from the MC and work my way back to
it.  Always worked for me.

Now... the real reason for the post...  the one thing that no one tells
you is that to successfully bleed brakes, at least by the pumping the
pedal method, you need to adjust the rear shoes hard against the drums!
This is true whether you are bleeding the rears or the fronts.  The MC
piston moves a grand total of maybe 1 cc in a stroke.  If the rear shoes
have motion, then 90% of that cc will go to moving the rear shoes against
the drums, then the remaining pittance will push air out.  It goes 10x as
fast if you use the whole stroke to push air out!  (and, face it, rear
brake shoes *always* need adjusting :-)

I have never used a vacuum bleeder, even tho I own and love my mity-vac,
because I have never been able to overcome the leaking bleeder thread
problem.  If there were something stiff that would seal the threads and
also said on the label &quot;this product is compatible with brake fluid, sue
us if we're wrong&quot;, then I would use it, but most brake fluids are
alcohols and most greases are petroleum products.  Are the compatible?  I
don't know.  Would I bet my life that they were?  No way!
