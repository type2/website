Subject: Jammed starter?

Our 78 Westy has had problems with the starter. It was rebuilt about 20,000 
km ago, and had given us no trouble until a couple weeks ago.

The bus would run great - we'd stop to get gas, and then it wouldn't start 
up again. Turning the key produced an obvious current draw (dash lights 
would flicker a little, door buzzer would change pitch slightly when 
driver's door was open). It's happened two times out of five starts 
recently. We diagnosed the problem as being with the starter gear getting 
hung up on teeth of the flywheel (as per the Muir Idiot Book)- the first 
time it happened we were able to get it running again by:

1. Putting it into 3rd gear.
2. Pushing it back a few feet - this spins the flywheel backwards to 
disentangle the starter pinion
3. Started up fine!

The second time it happened the above trick didn't work initially. After 
some rocking back and forth in all the gears (at least the ones which we 
could physically push against - we're weak) it came back to life. The third 
time we got a push start from a friendly guy in a service station parking lot.

While the behavior indeed sounds like it could have been the hot-start 
solenoid problem, we have noticed one piece of contrary evidence: whenever 
we pushed the bus (in any gear) there was a repetitive &quot;clunking&quot; (and 
correspondingly a repetitive &quot;resistance&quot; of the car to being pushed). This 
seems to be good evidence for the starter being jammed against the teeth of 
the flywheel, rather than having anything to do with the solenoid. Muir 
suggests that this has to do with the mounting of the starter motor itself.

Has anyone else had this specific problem? What's the recommended fix? Can 
the starter be removed without dropping the motor?
