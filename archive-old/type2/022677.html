Subject: Lack of Cooling Flaps

&gt;In conclusion, GET GAUGES!  With oil temp and cylinder head temp gauges 
&gt;you can drive around without the flaps and not worry too much because 
&gt;you will be able to monitor the temperature of the oil and cylinders and 
&gt;shut the engine down before it becomes a problem. 

Hmmm, I think I would prefer having the flaps to having the gauges~

&gt;Of course as Bill mentioned you should really get the flaps and a 
&gt;working thermostat so that your engine will warm up faster.

Yes, I had to relearn to put the flaps back in the motors I had taken them 
out of. I think I remember Wilson being ambivalent about them, particularly 
on the upright motor. After 8 winters in New York, I've gone full circle and 
now try to get the flaps &amp; thermostat system working as best I can. No flaps 
or some flaps may be more suited for southern california, but in the North 
East, the flaps shouldn't be overlooked for warming up the motor the 
effecient german way.
