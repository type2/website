Subject: [T2]Coil short - Found possible culprit

Hi All,

I think I found the cause of coil shorting out. The problems start only after the engine is warm/hot. (1972 westy with 2ltr &amp; FI) So this got me to thinking, the wiring harness for the fuel injection is an old one from the junk yard.  Sure enough: I found that when the engine heats up the insilation gets soft on the wire from the FI harness that conects to the coil. This is not good. I did a quick fix with electrical tape wrapped around it from end to end.  My next question is what gage wire is this (I know nothing about this stuff!) and is it any special type of wire that can handle the high heat or can I just go to any hardware store and get what they've got there?  I haven't road tested my quick fix yet, but I'm not so sure it's gona do much good.

Thanks so much,

Rae Borough
