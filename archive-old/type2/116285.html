Subject: Guage Questions!

Hey guys, I've got more of a general question here.. what is the third guage
cluster hole for? You know the one that's to the right of the speedometer?
Of all the VW Busses I've seen in the junkyard, it's been completely empty
with vents or something on the inside.. but still behind the clear plastic
glass.
