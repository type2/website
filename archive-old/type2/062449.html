Subject: Can someone help this guy out?

Volks,

Can anyone find out the name of the place in San Diego that restores
Westfalias?  I remember that there was such a place that advertised
frequently in the classifieds of the San Diego Union, but I can't find
their address or phone number.  I already replied and told him I thought a
fully restored Westy would run from $4000 - $5000.  Please help if you can!

&gt;Howdy David,
&gt;
&gt;I always see your homepage. :-))
&gt;This email from Japan.
&gt;I thinks that I will purchase Air cooled VW Westy.
&gt;But, few Westys in Japan.
&gt;Westy may be purchased in America.
&gt;Will Westy that Grand up full restolation was done be the price?
&gt;Westy must repaired thoroughly.
&gt;I wish it the final version of carb tipe in the makes(year).
&gt;Please tell me if knowing the approximate price of westy.
&gt;Do you know the store which sells such a Westy?
&gt;And, Do you know the store which sells the part of Westy?
&gt;It is a store in America which mail order(parts only) is prepared in
&gt;from Japan.
&gt;
&gt;I'm waiting for your reply.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your help,
&gt;
