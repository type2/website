Subject: Re: [T2] doophed up friday question

Dont know if it was the same on type two versions but on my type one 
engines there was a spring between the shroud and the carb. I believe 
there was another tube also.  I modified mine so the tube stayed in.  
flared the other end slightly and put a clip on it.
