Subject: Re: [T2] synthetic oil

Scott:

Some people will tell you not to use synth oil, others will tell you it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  If you have an engine with some mileage on it, and is prone to leaks, then leaking synth oil gets pretty expensive.  If your engine doesn't leak, then I'd say use synth.  I just built a new engine for my 71 Bus, and as soon as I have 1500 miles on it, I'm switching to Redline.  However, I wouldn't use synth unless your engine has an external filter.  Redline in particular is very resistant to thermal breakdown, and also keeps aircooled engines about 5-10% cooler than dino oil.
