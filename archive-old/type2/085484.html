&gt; hi everybody
&gt; can anybody tel me if a aircooled ingene van een 1978 t2b 2liter duble
&gt; caburator had manual or hydralic valve adjustment , and what are the right
&gt; clearences for this valves , are they sodium filled ore normal , and how can
&gt; you see the differents ?  al info very welcome
&gt; thanks co

North America = fuel injection, hydraulic lifters
Rest of World = carbs, solid lifters

If it's a CJ engine they will be solid unless someone has replaced them with
hydraulic at some point.  Clearances are 0.006 (0.15mm) all round.  The
valves are not normally sodium filled, but I think you would have to look at
the heads to know for sure.
