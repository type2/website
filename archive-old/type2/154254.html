As far as I know the Europeans are still only exporting a subset
 the models they build in Europe. It appears to be a mentality.

Not really a mentality. More of a money matter.

Each model brought in has to be certified to be able to pass emissions for x number of years, has to be crash
certified, has to have all USA spec parts on it: headlights, taillights, bumpers, crash bars in doors,
key-left-ignition-when-you-open-the-door buzzer etc. It runs somewhere over $100,000 to certify a model for
that model year. Then if they want to put a different engine/another option in it, that means it is another
model and the car needs to be certified again...... ka-ching, another $100K. That $$ has to averaged out over
the amount of each model they expect to sell for the year and added to the base price. And then there is the
gas guzzler tax....

A good example is Mercedes cars in the USA. They are not sold here by DCAG, Daimler-Chrysler. They are sold to
the US authorized dealers by MBUSA. MBUSA buys them from DCAG in Germany. A Mercedes in Europe comes with a 2
yr/unlimited mile warranty to the 1st buyer only!
Here in the USA, the car comes with a 4yr/50K bumper to bumper warranty that stays with the car. That warranty
is supported and funded by MBUSA only. Along with that, they also back the 7/70 Calif and 8/80 Fed emission
warranty. When parts fail they have to go back to the part manufacturer for a refund. With the price of a MB,
you gotta wonder how much MBUSA is paying for them from DCAG and then be self-supporting to meet the payroll
of MBUSA [it is huge!] and support the warranty. Yes, they do have problems......  The difference between MSRP
and invoice is 6%.
