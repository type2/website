Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Oil Cooler

The type 4 engine is really well suited for hot climates if everything is
working correctly.  I for one have off roaded VW's since the early 70's and
have found the only time a person has a problem is when they start adding
the extra stuff!!  Oil lines can (and do VERY often) rupture, split at the
ends, get ripped off by sticks and collapse internal causing the filter to
rupture.

Keep in mind, type 4's are AIR cooled, not OIL cooled, what you really need
to worry about is if your heads are running cool enough, the rest of the
engine will follow suit.

Your best money spent is to check all sheet metal to make sure it is tight,
make sure your engine compartment seal is in good shape and have your engine
tuned up with new parts.  Put some good 50 weight racing oil in and a bottle
of Lucas oil treatment.  Then make sure you are DRIVING your bus correctly,
no lugging or excessive RPM's, keep it as close to 3800 RPM as you can.

Invest your money in the engine, not the add ons and it will bring you home.

&gt; Jack,
&gt; 
&gt; Just a personal opinion, but if I had the money, and was going to Baja.
&gt; I would dry sump the engine and add a large oil cooler and fan combo,
&gt; that way not only do you have a cooler, but you have a larger oil
&gt; capacity so that the oil has further time to cool before it is dropped
&gt; right back into the hot engine case. Again, this is just a personal
&gt; opinion, and im sure there are some reasons out there why you would not
&gt; want to do this.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Glad you posted this. I'm heading to Baja where temps are often over
&gt; 100, and also have a 79. I have a 1.5 quart extra sump that I have to
&gt; yank because it hangs too low for off-road in Baja, so I need to add a
&gt; cooler. .......
