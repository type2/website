Subject: Re: [T2] how long will my motor likely last  then?

Connie,

Hmmm....maybe think of it this way...

A pretty bus the won't move on it's own power, or an ugly bus that can go 
anywhere.....

My wife and I have had this discussion...cosmetics generally comes last 
for me!

This is one ofthose situation where I *would* baby the engine...no 70mph 
in that one, just cruise along where it sounds and feels right(and you 
feel comfortable).


Cheers, dave

&gt; Since the milage talk I've been wondering when I would
&gt; have to pop for a new motor.  I have a 79 automatic
&gt; Champagn Westy from California which had an engine
&gt; rebuild about 121,000 miles ago.  I've since put a ton
&gt; of money into new ball joints, starter, gear shift
&gt; innards, fuel lines (of course), tranny rebuild,
&gt; shocks, throttle cable, etc. etc.  all done by my
&gt; local mechanics.  It's my daily driver and I travel up
&gt; and down Vancouver Island every two weeks over a
&gt; couple of minor mountains keeping speeds between 50
&gt; and 60 mph (except on the Alberni Mountain where I
&gt; can't get above 20mph).  
&gt; 
&gt; I need a paint job and a new tent top but am afraid to
&gt; go for it in case I'm going to need a motor rebuild
&gt; instead.  
&gt; 
&gt; I would welcome any information/wisdom re how much I
&gt; can expect from this motor.  I've only owned &quot;Muriel&quot;
&gt; for  a year and a half so I can't say if it's the
&gt; original motor.  
&gt; Thanks and I love everyone here!
