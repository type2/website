Subject: Bouncing messages, reports thereof...

 
Please quit posting accounts of bounced messages (and quotes of headers 
from bounced messages, and quotes of quotes of such headers). If you have 
a mail problem, report it to me at this address:

bighouse_at_socomm_dot_net

It's not something 360 people need to be bothered with over and over.
