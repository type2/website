Subject: Re: [T2] That old ignition switch problem

Hi Mark,

We're doing fine up here. We had a meeting of the group at a west-of- 
Toronto restaurant last night and everyone had a fine time. One of  
the highlights of the night was watching the video footage from  
&quot;Project Yellow Ribbon&quot; on DVD... I should have it online at  
busesofthecorn_dot_com later today.

The bullet fuse was indeed shown on mythbusters, and the bullet  
exploded when it was plugged into a shorted circuit. (one headlight  
was shorting to ground)

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
