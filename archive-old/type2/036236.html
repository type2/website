Hi,
 
&gt;  I use my camper to tow car trailers (up to 1.6 tons) and at times
the stock &gt; brakes seem to be insufficient for that.

 I agree with the assertion that you are exceeding the rated capacity of
the vehicle. I would think that you would need to uprate more than just
the brakes to tow this load &quot;safely&quot;.

 Take it easy....

Cheers,
	W.
