Subject: Re: [T2] Tow dolly around Washington, DC

I take the tires off of mine when i lock it down.


&gt;I just came home from a friend's place to pick up a tow dolly that I
&gt;wanted to borrow from him. When we came out of the house to unlock it
&gt;from a nearby telephone pole, the only thing that was there was a lock
&gt;cut into pieces but no tow dolly ...
&gt;
&gt;Folks, it seems as my Thanksgiving plans have been shattered. I wanted
&gt;to tow my buddy's Civic (dead engine) with my Camper (VW content) to
&gt;Phoenix where he has an engine waiting and pick up a 58 Opel Kapitaen in
&gt;Albuquerque on the way back.

When I needed a tow dolly way back when in 1995 I decided to buy a 
collapsible tow bar. Worked quite well. Bought it from Tomken Machine in 
CO. Pulled pickups and 4 banger cars...
