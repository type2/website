Subject: RE: [T2] Fix fogging around edge of winshield

Mine does that too... It's a lot more than a couple inches though. :(

My windshield has a crack on the passenger side anyway, and rust in the 
sill, so I have to do it all at once. Might as well put a new windshield in 
when I'm working on the rust anyway.

Of course, this is all moot until I get it running...
