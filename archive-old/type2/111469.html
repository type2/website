Subject: fuel pump &amp; endplay?

well, work is comming along quite well on the engine,
i needed 4 shims to set the endplay and that is a
little funny to me so any encouragement that this is
still ok please send it my way.

the fuel pump off the bad engine that is going on the
good engine has a 3rd line comming off of it running
into a little hole in the tin at the bottom.  where
does it end up at or does it just vent in their for
some reason?
