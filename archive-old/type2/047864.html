    I am posting to both lists because my bus falls into both =
categories. I have a 70 with a 1600cc dual port engine. This morning =
when I cranked him up, there was a funny, almost 'rubbing' sound. (It =
sounds very much like the sound my 68 made when its generator died.)
    I have an alternator that was out in, brand-new, 2 years ago this =
month. The sound is definitely coming from the engine compartment, and =
you can hear it and out of gear, but it is very faint. In fact, unless =
you drove him everyday like I do, you would probably not even notice the =
sound.
    I know it is a longshot to get any advice on a sound that none of =
you can hear, but I thought I would give it a try anyway.

Thanks for the time,
