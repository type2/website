&gt; Having made the mistake of watching my father arc weld once - he usually
&gt; shooed me away and I sneaked a look, I can tell you, don't do it. Took
&gt; quite a while (hours) for my eyes to &quot;come back&quot; to normal after an
&gt; extended look-see. Now I'm the Dad and away I shoo the children, dogs,
&gt; cats, and other critters... Eyes are non-replacement items... Take care

I saved a big box from an appliance delivery cut one corner and set it up
around my working area to keep curious eyes protected..
