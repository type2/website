Subject: Continuing Saga of Blocked fuel pump

Hey George, care to comment on the physics of a fuel pump trying to keep 
over 40 psi while working against a fuel tank or filter blockage?  Also, 
using a Bosch Ford 250 truck (89) pump designed for a 4 liter engine?
      Usually if blocked they run OK at idle or on the flats, begin to 
allow fuel starvation when one is under load (uphill).  This replacement 
will stall if one takes off to fast. I had a FIC that ran OK on the 
highway (did for over 700 mi on trip to Indiana from NJ, then died 
(would not restart at the rest area -current draw is like almost a 
direct short)- but ran when cooled down!  As I said before, We switched 
this pump to a Ford F250 truck one and after 5 hrs of ok driving and 
then a gas fill it ran with lots of hesitation-could have been water in 
gas as the drain to a pot looked like it had a layer of brown stuff in 
bottom. We got home (slowly) and did drain all the gas- looked clean and 
flowed OK!  The doubling up of the larger line wqith a smmler diameter 
piece under it to fit a VW filter to smaller inlet of replacement pump 
looked like it might have pinched the inner tube beyond pump nipple and 
caused starvation. The filter allowed easy blowing through. I blew air 
up the line and used proper metal filter, ran pump, sounded OK and drove 
4 mi before it got noisy and again hesitated!  Am getting another pump 
today as it may have gone bad (still noisy when cold, gauge jumps all 
over). It was quite a sight to have daughter leaning over the rear seat 
and watching the pressure gauge when we test drove.  Even popped the AFM 
cap to check pump contact; easy way to test pump BTW.


quoth G. Lyle re water pump
I don't think that the pump will be overstressed as long as the lines are
  large enough.  Remember that the pump normally works in a partially
  restricted environment when the thermostat is closed.
