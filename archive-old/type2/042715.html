&gt; Hi gang
&gt; 
&gt;    I acquired some bench seats from a friend for a type2.  One of them is a 
&gt; full length middle seat with the folding  back rest  (&quot;bucket&quot;) on the far 
&gt; right that we've all seen on countless buses. But the other one has me 
&gt; wondering. It is also a full width middle seat, but it has the folding back 
&gt; rest buckets on BOTH ends, with a solid center section only. Has anyone ever 
&gt; seen one of these? Could it be from a model with dual side doors? I'm curious 
&gt; as to what exactly I have stumbled onto.....
&gt;    Replies would be greatly appreciatted, maybe I can help out a person who 
&gt; needs something like this......
yep,

You guessed right, its a seat from a bus with doors on both sides.

If its for a baywindow bus i've no idea what its worth, the ones for
splitwindow busses are pulling in $1000 plus on the west coast.

take care,

Steve
