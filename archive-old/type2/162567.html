not a bus but best &quot;dumb luck&quot; happened a number of years ago, was zipping
along the NJturnpike way down in south Jersey near exit 2 or so. pretty
empty territory back them.  was in an Audi 100 when there is the sound
like an explosion and it stops we drift to side of road under an
underpass.  Pop hood and find the dist cap rotor etc is all &quot;gone&quot;just the
wires hanging there, all plastic pieces vanished.   we climbed up the
embankment to the road above to call help (no cell phones in them days)
and there is a nearby junkyard.  we walk over to usee his phone but on the
off chance he could help, he says he has one audi way in the back of his
yard.  we walk back there and open the hood and there is just the remains
of the block sitting on the ground, roll it over and a perfect distributor
is on the block, only part remaining on that engine..  gave the guy what
he wanted put it in and we were on our way, delay maybe half hour tops..
what are the odds!!
