Subject: More balancing

All this talk the last couple days about balancing has got me thinking and wondering. 
First a little back story: I Read here on the list that if you are removing pressure plate and clutch disc and intend to reuse them, you should make reference marks to facilitate rejoing pp and flywheel exactly as they were. 
Of course I read this AFTER I had taken the flywheel off of my engine (1.7 from 72) without making any such marks. The post said that this was necesary (or at least desirable) to maintain overall balance, or keep the parts happy by putting them back together as they were. It was also said that if installing new clutch components, one could bolt the pp on any old way with no ill effect.
After digeting that (and smacking my self on forehead a few times); I thougt that having flywheel and clutch components balanced should go on THE TO DO list. However, in this recent thread, it has been said at least once that balancing of flywheel and clutch components are the last step after balancing of everything inside the engine has been done.
I have no intention of doing a rebuild at this time. The engine was running good when I decomissioned the &quot;old&quot; bus and a rebuild would dealy this project until the next ice age.
My two part question: is there anything to the assertion that the PP and flyweel must be rejoined exactly as they were? Is it unaccepetably half-a***d or unecesary to have flywheel and clutch balanced.
Thanks for reading, any insight is appreciated
