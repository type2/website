Subject: New NWVW club site (Seattle)
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

FYI,
  The Northwest VW club site has moved to....

http://www.northwestvwclub_dot_org/index.htm

These Volks put on a couple of the big shows here.
The site is a good source for some of the local events
in the Seattle-Tacoma region.

Dan (close to Seattle)

May your heart always be joyful,
May your song always be sung,
May you stay forever young,
