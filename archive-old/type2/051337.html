Subject: &gt;   [T2] gas heater question              

I've been rebuilding BN4 heaters intensively for more than 2 years.  Maybee
15 units so far.  Last year I came across 3 bn2 to play with.  One of them
had the metering pump, just like our late BN4 style.  It's realy a nice
little furnace. The only way
to ignit it was by bypassing 12V to the 4volts glow plug for a shot blast.
about one second long. Once i got it running, the bn2 heater gives a realy
good heat,  I gave it back to the owner telling him to pay for a new plug
before installing the heater in a bug.

Later in the spring, I got 2 new plugs from England.  I traded bn4 parts for
the bn2 plugs and some dormobile stuff that isn't avalable here in québec.
So I work a bit on a not-so-bad-bn2 to get the diaphragm pump working and
every thing set for a little test.  I had 4 volts at the new plug and it
never ignit.  As it was a &quot;is-this-heater-fireable test&quot; so I decided to
blast the glowplug at 12 volts to finaly test it.

I haven't solve the 4volts glowplug mystery yet.  Out of the 4 bn2 I ran in
the last 2 years, no one never fire without the 12v blast.  But one they are
on, they keep the fire running.

I plan to work on the fuel mix to solve this.

&gt; &gt;doesn't get hot enough to ignite the gas.  As soon as
&gt; &gt;I  jumper 12 volts to the plug, it fires right off,
&gt; &gt;but with the normal 4 volts it only glows a dull
&gt; &gt;orange and won't ignite the gas.  Any ideas?
