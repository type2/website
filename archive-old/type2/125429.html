Subject: RE: [T2] Continental Vanco-8 tires

&gt; Just because you have done it doesnt make it smart, safe or 
&gt; sensible. It has nothing to do with personal ride preferance 
&gt; it has to do with safety and engineering. 


My opinion is that you should go with VW's recommendation. VW's
specifications were not just randomly chosen and I have seen no data
that would lead me to question their validity. For those are using
passenger car tires which are not rated to handle this pressure, inflate
to the maximum pressure listed on the sidewall and this will get you to
your nearest tire store so you can buy the correct tires for your bus.
Properly inflated tires are one way to prevent avoidable accidents. To
be frank, a Bus is not the safest vehicle around compared to today's
modern vehicles with airbags, antilock brakes, stability control, all
wheel drive, etc.. (Yes, I know, it was safe for its time, but standards
have improved.)  Why increase the risk by failing to maximize the
handling that the Bus was designed for?
