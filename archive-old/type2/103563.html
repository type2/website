&gt; The Bus obviously has more clearance.  It also seems to have better

The traction is comparable, but not as good as a bug.  It's the weight
distribution that determines traction.

  It also appears to care
&gt; less about bumps than the Subarus do -- which I find impressive, since
&gt; your average SUV will bounce around when it hits something that a Subaru
&gt; will just ignore.

The VW suspension was designed in the mid '30s, when normal driving
involved roads that would cause a current SUV pilot to pale.  Most
non-primary roads were dirt, usually not smooth.  Some complain about the
roughness of VW suspension on paved roads (transmitting small
irregularities, etc) but that was the least of the suspension designer's
problem in the '30s.

&gt; Can a carefully driven Bus negotiate such terrain, or am I foolish to
&gt; even have such thoughts?  Are there frame/suspension parts that, given
&gt; proper maintenance and absent rust, still can't handle a rough road?

Not really.  It's a tough beast.  Be careful of the loose stuff and it
will get you there.

&gt; How far do you have to tip a Bus before it decides to roll over?

Quite a way, but keep in mind the bus was designed before Consumer Reports
started fixing their lane-change tests.  I wouldn't take it more than 30
degrees from upright.

&gt; How
&gt; easy is it to get a Bus hopelessly stuck?

Very easy, if the surface is loose.  Be prepared, walk the tough spots,
and don't be afraid to say &quot;enough!&quot;
