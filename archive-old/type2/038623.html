I sympathise with your predicament, I too have brought busses with dead
engines &amp; body panels made of old cardboard. However you do have to allow
for wear'n'tear &amp; even over hear in the UK all receipts are &quot;as is&quot;. I hope
you have been the victim of no more than a bad case of &quot;Murphy's law&quot; &amp; not
foul play. Emotions can run high when you place a finite sum on a dream of
any kind. Take our latest van 'Mrwhipy', In the 3 years we have owned him
2.5 have been spent in the workshop due to a lazy mechanic &amp; my own failure
to chase the S.O.B! Your dealing with a list member _at_ I think anyone
deserves the benefit of the doubt, if not then they can be chalked up with
the Todd hill's of this world. Stay cool &amp; let the Busma flow.

Andrew
