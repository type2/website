Subject: '77 Westy Questions..Brace yourself

hey now,

well, after years of wishing for one, i finally have a westy. now i've got
questions for ya....:-)

a) on a '77, does it have hydraulic lifters? or do i check the valves?
b) will a '74 transaxle (with both cv joints attatched) fit a '77?
c) what kinda dohickey do i need to plug into the 12volt thingy under
the glove box?
d) what is egr?
e) what kind of cord do i need to hook power up to the van? how safe is it?
can i run any small apliance off of this?
f) i assume 20w50 oil is okay to run on in the summer in a '77? i need to
change the oil first thing.
g) i have ac but it don't work. would it be a smart idea to complete remove
the ac unit so i have less weight? should i leave it alone?
h) what other goodies do i have now and not know about? :-)
