&gt; Regardless how it has occured, the DM is dead, at least in the case of the

I noticed this first with BMW motorcycles, not being interested in current
VW automobiles.  For years BMW made a big deal out of their excellent
longevity records and easy maintainance.  100K miles was nothing on a BMW
when the best of Japan's motorcycles were lucky to see half that.

With the introduction of the R1100 model a few years ago, there was little
mention of the motorcycle being long-lasting or easy to maintain.
Instead, the BMW literature crowed about how most of the parts of the
motorcycle were labeled for easy recycling.

I think that, with the accelerating rate of technological advancement, the
general public isn't all that interested in longevity.  They don't want to
be stuck with an &quot;obsolete&quot; 5-year-old vehicle when they can have the
latest whiz-bang toy.  That 100K mile $2000 head job is just the excuse
they need to head for the new-car showroom.  Whatever shame might be
generated by wasting the remaining useful life of the 5-year-old car will
be salved by the knowledge that some parts of it can be recycled.

Being a bit older and raised by depression-era parents, I derive pleasure
from keeping my bus on the road.  I suppose that you need to be a bit odd
to want to look at the same dashboard for several decades.  Anyway, nobody
says &quot;Gee, that's a _great_ Dodge Caravan!&quot;
