I run my Mac SE off of the inverter without any troubles at all.  I start
and stop the engine while it's running, too, but it's a $100 computer.  I
would think twice about voltage spikes if I were using an expensive
computer.

If you can run your computer directly from DC, then do it - It's WAY more
efficient.  Look at the Toshiba cable real closely then make one just like
it for 1/10 the cost.
