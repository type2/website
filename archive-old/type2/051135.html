Subject: Re: [T2] eingine rebuild and compression ratio

Marcusu240_at_gateway_dot_net sends:

&gt; Hello all, It's never easy.  I'm in the early stages of a 1800 rebuild,
&gt; initially I was just going to do the top end but now I've decided to split
&gt; the case and take a look at the bottom.  My goal is to make this a 2l FI.
&gt; So, I talked to the machine shop and they said they could offset grind the
&gt; crank to accept 2L rods.  Then I just happened to talk to an Older guy (age
&gt; 75), not that it matters, at work whom I never would have imagined knew
&gt; anything about air-cooled vws but apparently he does used to drive them for
&gt; years.  He told me that today's unleaded fuel is going to destroy my fresh
&gt; rebuilt motor unless I have someone &quot;a professional&quot; build the motor and get
&gt; the compression ratio decreased so that I can use today's fuel.  He was sort
&gt; of discouraging me from doing the job my self, and didn't offer any info on
&gt; lowering the compression ratio but told me to go figure it out.

&gt; So that's what I'm planning on doing but I need some direction.  First
&gt; question how much truth is there in this gentleman's statements.  Second
&gt; question does anyone have any good links to sources that will help me
&gt; understand this.  I've read Tom Wilson's book but I didn't remember anything
&gt; about decreasing compression ratio.  This guy only works on weekends so I've
&gt; got this week to figure all this out and then I'm going to explain it to him
&gt; and show him that I know what the hell is up.  If the stock set up is OK then
&gt; that's great and please let me know but I still want to have a &quot;basic&quot;
&gt; understanding of the calculations that go into engine building.  As always
&gt; you feedback is greatly appreciated.

Marcus, the first thing you should do is go to Home Depot and buy a 50-lb
bag of Sterilized Cow Manure from the garden center. That way you will have
something that's less full of crap than your co-worker. People on this very
list run self-built motors all the time. Most of us are not professional VW
mechanics.

Here's the deal: old, old VW engines needed leaded fuel to lubricate the
valve seats; without it the seats would get little pits in them. VW started
installing hardened valve seats (IIRC they are made from Stellite, a very
hard metal) in their engines before the Type 4 engine was released. So
you're fine.

Compression ratio (CR), the ratio of cylinder volume with the piston all the
way down to volume with it all the way up, is a different matter. The
Volkswagen engine was designed for regular gas, research octane 91. Current
regular is (research + motor / 2) 87; midgrade is 89, premium is 93. You can
go two ways: leave the CR alone and burn high-octane gas, or lower the CR
and burn regular. You lower the CR by putting metal spacers on the cylinder
barrels (they go between the bottom of the cylinder insert and the case) to
increase the &quot;deck height.&quot; Instructions for doing this are in John Muir's
Idiot Book, and so is the CR formula. (Someone who's dropped the CR in a VW
engine would know how far to go--I just leave it alone and run premium.) If
you do your rebuild correctly you will measure all four cylinders anyway, so
setting the CR is not difficult.
