Or - you could figure out a way to drain off about a
quart+ and put in a quart of Power Punch or Hilton Hy
Per Lube or even a quart of straight SAE60 oil and see
if there's a significant change with slightly thicker
oil. If so, it pretty much indicates rebuild time...
but I got by running straight 50 or 60 for a couple
years! I always use the HyPerLube or Power Punch (same
product / different labels.) -BaH

BTW - a turkey baster works really well for sucking
out oil, but you'll prolly have to add a short hose
extension to it. (available at Safeways everywhere!)

&gt; Yeah, it leaks about a quart every two weeks of
&gt; daily driving.   Never have figured out where.  Just
&gt; changed the oil.  No  help.  I'm thinking it's the
&gt; sender because it tends to go off at  low RPM as
&gt; often as at medium RPM.  That wouldn't make sense if
&gt; I  really had a pressure problem, right?  &lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
