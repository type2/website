Subject: Re: [T2] Gene Berg

Gene Berg is a fellow famous for his HIGH PERFORMANCE (read HIGH COST) VW 
engines. They were very high quality and he made a real name for himself 
producing very nice good fast goodies.

He passed away a few years ago and his son has continued the business. They 
have a website and if you like to read he has a few books - that he calls 
technical articles.

Do you have a Gene Berg engine? I dunno but I bet you have Gene Berg valve 
covers or Gene Berg heads.

&gt;Who is Gene Berg, and why is his name stamped inside my engine under the
&gt;valve cover?
&gt;
&gt;My other question, what would all the black &quot;burned&quot; stuff be around the
&gt;valve cover gasket, inside on the engine etc?  Smelled burnt when I took it
&gt;off, and I have much dirt (or probably engine particles) if I was to guess.

The burnt stuff is probably dirt and baked grease (used to be oil).

Don't let any of the outside engine dirt get into your engine. It will ruin 
it in short order especially b/c it doesn't have an oil filter.
