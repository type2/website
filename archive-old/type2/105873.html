Those standards are pretty strict. My limits were 2.5% and 3% and no NOx test.

&gt;
&gt;2. Thermostatic air cleaner missing
&gt;
&gt;I understand per Karl, that these were never installed on buses, but I looked in the &quot;mitchell&quot; book with the guy, and they are shown.

It's wrong, hence our eternal struggle. Smog referee...take your Bentley. It shows the serial numbers affected.

&gt;3. EGR missing.
&gt;
&gt;I have a 79cal engine which did not come with EGR, I will bring this up to the referee this week.
&gt;
&gt;5. o2 sensor present, not required
&gt;
&gt;Another 79 addition

Did he read it right?

1979 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, 16 EVAP, OC, FR, 13 EGR, 2 O2S, 2 CEC

13 - Federal only
2 - CA only

How did he fail you on both 3 and 5 if he was reading the Mitchell correctly?

&gt;My main question is how to get the CO down, the other stuff is referee mayhem I'll have to fight over.

I turned the idle mixture screw in the AFM a full turn at the %CO went from 3.5% to 2.5%. I'd like to know the answer to this question also.

Question to the list: are clogged injectors or greater than normal misfiring the liekly culprit?
