Subject: Re: [T2] The full report (long)

No. For most things, it's far more cost-effective to order by internet. 
Figure average shipping is $9.95. My time is expensive, and when I give 
it away, I do so on things I enjoy. Driving around buying stuff isn't 
one of those things.

Even a &quot;quick trip&quot; to Harbor Freight seems to end up taking me two 
hours.
