&gt; All I have is a cheap Radio Shack digital voltmeter/ohm-meter. Removing all
&gt; fuses from the fuse box and testing the tension at each circuit separately,
&gt; I find that 7 out of 12 show no tension (I guess that's good). The other 5,
&gt; however, give me a fluctuating reading with a 15-second cycle climbing from
&gt; 0 to 400 mV, a sudden peak at 4V and sudden drop back to 0.
&gt; I have no idea what this means
&gt; 
&gt; As I tested this last night, the battery was already down to 8 volts. It's a
&gt; relatively new battery, too.

Sami:
I'd guess it's a bad battery. Maybe try another known good used one?
Easy for me to say as I have about 5 laying around that'll fit in!
(most US car batteries don't fit so well!)
