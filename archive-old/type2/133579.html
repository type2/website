Subject: Please help start my cold van (fwd)

All,

Please reply directly to Jeff and not to me.  Yes, this is a rather late
forward; it came in to the type2_dot_com Library address.

Subject: Please help start my cold van

Hello,
I recently drove across the country back to the east
coast. My van is not liking the cold winter we are
having up here in NY and it's only December. I have a
79 Westfalia with a fairly new 2.0 FI engine in it. It
starts fine on warm days but after sitting at 15
degrees all night the mornings are not friendly. I've
tried a magnetic engine heater block to warm it up and
I've also had the trickle battery charger going all
night to warm up the battery. I've heard of some kind
of cold start adjustment that I may be able to do to
the fuel system, but I need some details. The starter
cranks and cranks and cranks and some times I get a
little put-put from the muffler like it really wants
to start, but no go. Any advice you might have with
getting this baby to fire when it's cold sure would be
a great help.
Thanks for your time and your love of Vdubs.
Take care, Jeff
