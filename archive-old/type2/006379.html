What you need are RECMAR Slide-Rite Curtain Track slides.  These slides fit
perfectly in every Westfalia curtain track I've tried, splitties and
baywindows.

The original Westfalia curtains used sliders that were factory-sewn to a
cloth tape about an inch wide.  The cloth tape was then sewn to the top edge
of the curtain material.  In 10+ years of searching I haven't found a source
for this tape with the correct sliders sewn in.

The RECMAR slides have a small eye which you attach to the curtain with
several loops of stout thread.  It's a very simple job - even I can do it
reasonably well and I'm both old and clumsy.

The RECMAR Slide-Rite materials only come in 1 [one] size - associated part
numbers refer to a particular combination of track pieces, lengths, and
colors [white or brown], packaged in kits with an appropriate number of
slides, mounting screws, and stops for the track ends.

The kit in front of me is #3171.  It has 2 white 36&quot; pieces of track, a
couple of dozen white slides, and the necessary stainless steel hardware to
complete the installation.  The price at Boater's World a couple of years
ago was $6.99.

In years past the slides have been available separately, with a couple of
dozen slides per bag, but my local sources no longer stock anything but the
complete kits.

When I went through this same inquiry/exchange last September I found the
RECMAR curtain hardware in the online catalogs of Boater's World, West
Marine, and Camping World.  Try searching for &quot;RECMAR&quot;.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  I found RECMAR.

They do not deal with the public directly, but they sent me a catalog today.
When I get it, I will match the right product to my (69 Westy) ccurtain
rails in the cab and I'll post the product serial number to the list as well
as a list of places to get it. I'll also scan in a pic from the catalog,
since no website I've found has a pic.  &lt;&lt;
