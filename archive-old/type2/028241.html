Well, looks like I won't be much help about AFM since I don't know what that 
is. In the other hand you know.....so, do you mind teaching me this?

Hi all,

      I finally took my 82 Westy to a mechanic.  He changed my head temp
sensor &amp; told me that he could not adjust the CO lower then 2.5%.  He says
that is a likely bad AFM.  Is there anything else that would cause that
before I plunk down the money for a AFM?  It is definitely driving better
since the head temp sensor was changed.  Any insights or ideas?  Thanks.
