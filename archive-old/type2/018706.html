1982 Volkeswanen Camping bus-Classic, air cooled engine, gd cond, blue,
$1,800. near Ft. belvoir. 703 690 6327.  Lv mssg

I called.  The lady said they had it since 1989. Prviously her husband
had an older model.  Said refrigerator.  no rust (What, did I hear 'no
rust'?!?!)  Was from Florida.  Powder Blue. about 130k miles.  Four
speed.   Just 2 miles from my home.

Think I will stop by, on the way home. Check it out....   This is
probably going to be gone, soon.  Eric F, don't you need a brick?!?!?!
Mike Benthin, aren't you always looking for another rust free
whatever?!?!?

BTW, the '80 camper that I saw with the nice cabinets is probably going
to be made road worthy soon and then sold.  I won't go back for this,
but it would make someone a nice project.  Canvas is tacky, though.

Barry sends from the good old USA (happy 4th, every one!!)
