This would make a terrific cottage industry for somebody on the list -- 
reweaving FI harnesses. The only core that would be required, I think, 
would be the four big plugs: ECU, AFM, resistor block, and dual relay. 
There must be a source for the small female connectors and the small 
plugs. It would be nice to work out a way to put the red numbers on the 
new white wires, but maybe not essential.

With a 4X8 plywood board and some hooks, the process could be 
streamlined. I would certainly pay up to $100 for a fresh harness. With 
some wise purchasing, the material costs shouldn't run more than $20-25.
