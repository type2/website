For those who might be interested there is a chat room for VW fans at
http://www.vwmagazine_dot_com/chat/

so far I've only run across aircooled folks.  If you get bored or just feel
the need to chat with others of the VW persuasion you might consider
dropping by.  Not many bus folks yet but you could change that.

Posted chat times are 8-11 p.m. PST, but probably would change if the
traffic increased.
