Subject: Re: [T2] Hankook Tires are back!

Ron,
Thanks for these explanations. As a foreigner I never quite understood how
this tire rating was working in the US. The hankook RA08 would definately be
called a summer tire where I come from. &quot;All-season&quot; works as long as all
the seasons are spent in SoCal excluding Idyllwild, Big Bear and so on.
Where I come from 95% of the car owners have 8 tires per car, 4 summer tires
and 4 winter tires. Those who install winter tires only on the wheels driven
by the engine are called fool. The number of days spent with the winter
tires before the first snow comes on depends on the driver, but is
proportional to the driver's wisdom and price of the car.
Where I come from being Switzerland. :-)
- Arnaud


That said, superior does not mean optimal. Neither the Hankooks nor most
&gt; &quot;all-season&quot; tires are any match for an actual snow tire.  I spoke at
&gt; length
&gt; to an engineer at Vredestein about this very issue a couple of years ago
&gt; when I first started carrying their tires.
