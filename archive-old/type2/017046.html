&gt; Like so many others we made the &quot;too much stuff&quot; mistake also. It's

&gt; The real solution is an adjustment of mind. It's surprising how few
&gt; things are needed for comfortable living in the VW bus once one
&gt; has broken loose from the illusion things = safety, comfort etc
&gt; that a lifetime of advertizing has pounded into us.


      Well, a lot of my space is filled with the clothes I need to wear
to work everyday -- a job, I might add, where jeans are verboten. What I
miss most (other than my wife and my dog) are my books, but those along
would fill my bus. OTOH, I have had a life-long wish to live the simple
life of a forest monk. I see these guys here with the giant packs
wandering the highways, living a very minimalist existence, and wonder
how that would be. 
      My wife and I, our two children, and a dog and a cat all lived in
our '69 bus (a non-westy) and a tent for 3 months, traveling the US and
Canada the summer of '71, I think it was. We seemed to have things much
better organized than what I have right now. 
      What I probably should have is a top carrier -- I've got a long
one that fits on my Yakima racks, that I use for my sails, booms, and
related sailboard stuff, but I left that all at home because I can't
windsurf right now due to some recent surgery -- but anyway, a nice
square top carrier that would fit right on the &quot;luggage rack&quot; area, and
still let you pop the top. A lot of the stuff filling up the built-in
Westy storage spaces could really go in that.
