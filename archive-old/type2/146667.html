Closer than the real ones.

But Scarborough is cool.  Greg, do you know the folk song (and 
Simon &amp; Garfunkel tune) &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;?  I wish there were
something like it about my place of birth.  But &quot;Are you going
to Dinslaken Fair?&quot; isn't really something I expect to hear 
anyone sing anytime soon :-)

SCNR, TGIF, airhowlingly yours:
