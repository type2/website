Tom,

The free play in the pedal should not deviate beyond what the book says -
typically 1 or so inches (if memory serves). Assuming this is what the
current adjustment is, the different idle speeds might be a sign of a
throw-out bearing going south.

Good luck -

When the clutch is out (pedal
&gt; not depressed) the engine idles at a lower speed than when the clutch is
in
&gt; (pedal depressed).
