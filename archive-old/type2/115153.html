Subject: RE: [T2] I've had it up to my fuel filler neck with gas
  smell....

Corbett wrote:&gt;&gt;&gt;If you remove the firewall, you can get to
all the rubber connectors on the top of the tank. The other one is behind 
the
spare tire. You cannot see it, but you can feel it. Replace all of these and
then look into replacing the charcoal filter and the rubber connecters
associated with it. I replaced all of these and the smell is completely 
gone.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Thanks for all the info. Assuming I need to, what specifically did you 
replace the rubber (breather?) connectors with? Is it fuel line, breather 
line, rubber line...how many inches/feet total? When you pop them off, I 
assume fuel is going to come out, so I'd better be prepared to clamp or plug 
the lines while I put new connectors in, correct? I'm trying to get my 
mental picture as complete as possible.
