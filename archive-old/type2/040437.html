Subject: BN4 Heat???

Hi all,
As I am ready to depart for Alaska tomorrow I wanted to thank you all for
the previous answers to my questions which helped my bussy bus get ready for
the big trip.  One last question though.....
It's a shot in the dark but where on earth will I find heating ducts and
such for my BN4 heater so I can eventually hook it up?
It will be darn cold in Alaska.
thanks
Dave
