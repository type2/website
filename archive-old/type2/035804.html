Subject: Can't find a Vacuum Leak

Hello All,

While travelling BBBIV, I acquired what was originally deemed to be a vacuum 
leak on my 76 FI Westy.

The engnine will start after some effort and some very obvious PFFFT, PFFFT 
from the passenger side.  It will idle and the PFFT is less obvious but still 
there.  After about 20 minutes of driving/running, it will then stall out at 
idle whenever I stop and get more and more difficult to restart after every 
stall.

However, I have not been able to find any hoses that seem to be loose/cracked.
 I sprayed generous amounts of WD-40 on all the hoses and connections and 
didn't get any reaction from the engine.  That's why I think it something 
other than a vaccuum leak from a hose.  Can I get a vaccuum leak somewhere 
else?

I adjusted the valves back in early/middle December, and it was running fine  
(40 miles to work and back each day, a few errands weekly) until this &quot;long&quot; 
trip.

Any ideas would be helpful....
