Subject: Bench testing a FI system
Message-ID: &lt;C51ED84B6F47D211917A0000F8BCBD11015500DA_at_zcard00g_dot_ca.nortel_dot_com&gt;

	 Someone wrote 
&gt; Setting up the FI system on a test stand very much intrigues me. I'm
&gt; wondering how much of this could be done without an engine...  ? 
	[Crick, Bill ]  This shouldn't be too tough to do without an engine
- Iff your goal is to study the electrical outputs
	which is the width of the injector pulses, cold start valve signal.
This won't alow you to diagnose air handling issues
	with the system when it is in the vehicle such as vaccuum leaks, aux
air reg...    
	Of course this is easy for me to say with my limited knowledge;-)
	The only thing you need to make a FI go is: 
	12V; 
	Something to jiggle the wire going to the points you could even
drive a distibutor 
	with a variable speed drill if you want to go real low tech and use
the actual points; 
	and maybe a few resistors to replace the head temp  sensor if you
want to be able to simulate varying temperatures, or
	you cold just heat the thing up with a heat gun, or hot plate.
	Aux air regulator does not affect the, thermo time switch should
shut itself off.
	I'd rccomend having injectors hooked up so the ECU has proper load
to avoid potential damage, but they can survive
	bad wiring, etc that can unhook the injectors in a vehicle so this
may not be necessary.

	So in summary: 
	rip the entire sucker out by its roots
	give it 12v
	toggle the points wire
	Cook the head temp sensor to taste.

	What am I missing?
