if you havent priced foam yet it aint cheap. after much research i found 
fabricsbyous_dot_com.
I bought better quality foam, much cheaper (even with delivery) and they
even cut the pieces for no charge.
They also have naugahyde cheaper than Ive found elsewhere. The closest to
the yellow bus color is Spirit Millenium US324. Although mine seems to be
more brown and has a slightly mottled graining.
Dont worry about the listed prices, the naugahyde says 26.50 on the
website but they charge like 1/2 the listed price.
