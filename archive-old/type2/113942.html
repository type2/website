TDC sensor.  You can remove it and leave the hole open, or just leave it there.  I've never seen a functioning TDC sensor on a type IV, they are pretty rare.  Even ol 'n bust'd ones are pretty rare.

&gt;                     also, when taking off my carbs i noticed one engine
&gt;                      had a spacer between the manifolds and the heads and
&gt;                      the other didn't

Typically the spacers were for fuel injected engines only.

&gt;                     one engine had big bolts on either side of the head
&gt;                      just to the outside of where the manifolds bolt down
&gt;                      and my other engine only has one on the drivers
&gt;                      side????

Air injection ports.  1973 had one per cylinder (four total) and 1974 only had one on the drivers side (three total).  I've never been able to figure out why this is.  If there are really bolts there, then someone has plugged the ports with bolts.  If they are original they would actually be threaded, hollow tubes with a fitting at the top to attach to a pipe assembly that straddled the engine.  Many people cut these tubes and pinch them off when they remove the crosspipe assembly.
