Subject: Valve adjust. w/ hydraulic lifters

I know i need to adjust these valves differently since i have hydraulic 
lifters.  I know i am supposed to take the adjustment screw down until it 
hits the valve spring.. but then how much farther??? i'm thinking like 1.5 
turns or something. but i can't remember and can't find it in the muir book. 
thanx soo much

cheers,
