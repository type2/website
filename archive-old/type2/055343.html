Subject: leaky carb

List
Avoid a fire! I have a 71 with a Weber pic34 that runs great. Lately I've noticed that, when I drive for a while and then shut down, the carb drips gasoline. I can't tell yet where it's coming out but it appears to be fairly high up on the carb, up at least as high as the butterfly valve. You can tell I don't know carbs well but would this be expected in hot weather? Could the float bowl be overflowing or what.
 
Please respond. I don't want the bus to burn up!
