&gt;This a very time consuming and expensive project to do it correctly.  You
&gt;would be many hours, dollars and headaches ahead if you just sold the
&gt;Vanagon and bought a type 4 engine.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have a 1980 Vanagon engine I'd like to install a in my 1979 Westy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Questions I have are,  Can this easily be done? Are there any problems or
&gt;&gt;things I should look out for?

I think rick thought this was a water cooled engine.

The '80 into a '79 is a wonderful drop in.  Got to exchange the fan shroud
all bus exhaust, drill out the mounting holes in the motor mounts for the
12mm bolts, and use the vanagon breather and dipstick (using the bus
fill and dipstick as well.)

Works great.

John
