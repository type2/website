Subject: Re: [T2] over heating

I was strongly invloved we had the bentley out,  everything seemed (at
lest to me ) to go back together right, I was wondering about the
condition of the oil cooler though    it looked kinda old and grungy,
could that have a part? how would I tell?  i'm not sure how they work
specifically, oh the engine is also running rich. and we can't seem to
iron it out.

&gt; Don't want to sound snobbish....but was it done correctly?? When I first got my 1973, it was supposedly to have been &quot;freshly rebuilt&quot; 6 months ago. Suddendly one of the valve seats came loose and damaged the head/and the piston!!!
&gt;

&gt; well, we just replaced the rings and had the heads machined and what
&gt; not, is there anything else you can think of?

&gt; &gt; You seem to loose oil pressure, maybe?? I had the same thing happen to my 1982 Vanagon. It would start clicking/loosing power at higher speeds. It turned out that it needed a head job!! On both heads!! While the heads are off the car, you can also check the pistons for wear. That whole adventure cost me a healthy $1.800US.

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; got an issue today I can't figure out nor my mechanic.
&gt; &gt; on highway travel my engine heats up and then the valves start to click,
&gt; &gt; power is lost a little-not  to much. Eric says my engine sounds like it
&gt; &gt; is eating itself. I'm going ove rto the shop today to change the oil
&gt; &gt; start to weld a custom exhust and figure out this over heating thing.
&gt; &gt; any help would be so great. Thanx ya'll
&gt; &gt;
