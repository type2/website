My latest container from Europe has arrived and there are a few new items,
as well as new supplies of items previously posted but long since sold out.
This rundown is a bit long, so please proceed directly to the &quot;delete&quot; key
if you're not interested. These are special Listmember deals, so you MUST
specify that you are a listmember when ordering.

The genuine VW German heat exchangers that I mentioned on the list are now
in!  I have pairs of '72-74 German heat exchangers at $399.95/pair (part #
021 256 092PR), or left side only at $129.95 (021 256 091M). Match these
with the Stainless exhaust system further down for a killer setup. (Sorry,
right side not sold separately in German.)  I have pairs of Vanagon German
heat exchangers for $349.95/pair (part #  071 256 091PR).  I have right side
'68-71 German heat exchangers at $99.95 (part # 043 255 108HG).  While I do
not have the left-side '67-71 in German, I got a closeout on left side
Danish ones (the heavy duty ones, not the flimsy ones sold by other vendors)
at $79.95 (part # 043 255 107H) so you can make a pair.

The &quot;German&quot; 1600 dual port heads are also in, as posted to the list. These
are genuine VW (Brazil) heads with all German components (valves etc)
installed.  Closest to a brand new German head you can get.  $99.95 each,
which is an absolute steal. Part number 043 101 355CK

I found a small supply (6 pair) of genuine GERMAN front door seals for
'68-79.  These have been discontinued for several years.  The ones I usually
ship (for $19.95 each) are Brazilian VW, and while they're better than the
aftermarket ones everyone else sells they do not match the fit and quality
of the old German ones.  However, the German ones are not cheap.  Last price
was $120 each when you could get them.  These are $179.95/pair.  When they
are gone I do not expect to see them again, so this could be your last shot
at this quality ever. Part # 211 898 721D

I got a fresh supply of body rubber, all genuine VW or European aftermarket.
This includes virtually all window and door seals.  So when you order rubber
from me you will get these, at the posted prices, as opposed to the
aftermarket knockoffs that everybody else is shipping for the same price.
Nobody else in the U.S. has these but me.

I got genuine Hella rear taillight assemblies for '72-79.  Normally I only
can get aftermarket.  These are $36.95 each and include lenses and housings
(which is only a few bucks more than the aftermarket ones usually go for).
Best quality available, while they last.  Part #

After a year of unavailability, I have what will probably be my last shot at
the Genuine Hella Chrome Hubcaps that sold out so quickly last year.  These
are the smaller chrome metal ones that leave the edges of the wheel exposed
(also used on Busses), not the big plastic ones found on the later Vanagons
in the U.S. (although they will fit all years).  What makes these unusual
compared to the aftermarket Mexican and Taiwanese ones usually sold is that
they are much heavier duty, primered on the inside, and less prone to rust
out in two weeks than the knockoffs are.  At $49.95 for a set of 4 (  ) they
are only a couple of bucks more than the knockoffs usually sell for.

I got some Genuine VW sheet metal.  I have complete rear corners, top to
bottom including vent area, for '72-79 (big tail light), for $89.95 each
(left # 84131, right 84132).  Also genuine VW battery trays for '73-79 for
$26.50 each (left 95 56 691, right 95 56 690).  And complete front wheel
arches for '73-79 for $89.95 (left 95 56 311, right 95 56 312).  Again,
these are genuine VW, not aftermarket, and nobody else in the U.S. has them.

I got my last shot of genuine Boge shocks for busses, at $16.95 each (about
40% off). These are made in the same Boge factory in Mexico that makes the
Boge branded ones, and are identical to them, but carry the Technum by Boge
name. This is a trade name that Boge used for overseas markets and is
discontinuing; the shocks are identical.  Part numbers 211 413 031P (front),
211 513 031R (rear).

I got more of the Stainless Steel o.e. replacement '72-74 mufflers. Best you
can put on your bus, bar none. These also fit '79-83 (but with no provision
for cat or egr filter), or '75-78 if you use '72-74 heat exchangers (on sale
in N.O.S.; see above). Price is $159.95 for the muffler only (071 251 053ES)
or $179.95 for a whole system (including installation parts and
non-stainless tailpipe; 071 251 053EKS).

I finally have the Hella Dual Battery Relay Kits back in stock.  These are
very similar to the optional relay setup found on Westfalias that came with
2 batteries, and work on any '67-91 bus or Vanagon.  Price is $18.95, part
number 1738.

I have received more of the German Side-Tents, at $379.95, part A0022.  I
posted these to the list a while back but they sold out very quickly.  There
is a jpg at   .  These attach to the side of your bus without any drilling
or modification of your bus, or can be used free-standing.  No floor.

I got one last retracting sliding door step, N.O.S. Volkswagen. No more when
it's sold. This step slides out when you open the door.  Genuine VW box, no
instructions so you'll have to wing it. Optional in Europe, never offered in
the U.S. to my knowledge. $249.95 (221 898 062A).

I got genuine German VW oil coolers (part 021 117 021B) for $99.95
I got seals for the air flap rod, long unavailable, genuine VW, $2.50 each
(9285).
I got 4 Genuine VW (Brazil) 30 pict carbs for single-port eng, manual choke,
$99.95 each (113 129 027K)
I got 3 lower sliding door brackets, genuine VW, part number 211 843 406E,
normally $120, now $79.95.
I got N.O.S. winshield washer nozzles (with gasket), regularly $6.95 each,
now $2.50 each (211 955 993).
I got 6 chrome headlight trim rings -.Genuine VW ones with the correct drain
holes for a Bus, not the aftermarket ones.  $19.95 each, part # 211 941 175.
I got aftermarket drivers side mirrors for $13.95 (211 837 513FOR).  Not
German quality (which I do have for $24.95), but cheap.


Again, be sure to specify your list membership&quot; to get these prices. You can
order toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT, or via the website.  (Any items not yet
on the website will be added tomorrow.)  This is first come, first serve,
and prices may go up as quantities near depletion.
