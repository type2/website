&gt;Well it seem like billv2_at_prodigy_dot_net was posting about manual transmission
&gt;oil and not engine oil.
&gt;
&gt;I was hoping on finding info about the stuff you put in your engine.
&gt;
&gt;Archives were not much help.

That suprises me.  Lots has been posted on this subject in the past.

&gt;  I was wondering if synthetic oil is an option for my bus.

Sure.  I use Mobil-1 15W50 in summer and 10W30 in winter.  It is superior
oil and works well in aircooleds despite what some may say.

&gt;  And what about additives, like Dura-lube or Slick 50?

Not necessary, but probably wouldn't hurt.  I don't use them.

From ZR72_at_aol_dot_com:
&gt;i hate to exploite something, but this is an excellent opportunity,  so
&gt;without mentioning brand names and getting into a * my brand is better than
&gt;your brand * FART then i will just say that if you are interested in an
&gt;extremely top of the line synthetic oil, that has never been beaten in any
&gt;independent lab, or road test EVER  then email me and i ll send you a catalog
&gt;for FREE  and you can order it yourself  warehouse direct at a better than
&gt;redline price for a twice as good product.  interested???????

Probably Royal Purple - am I right?  RP is good oil, maybe better than
Mobil 1 but you can't buy it at any Wal Mart while you're on a
cross-country trip.  What's more, to get a good price on it from an
&quot;independent distributor&quot; you need to buy in quantity, and in large
containers.  I tried it, found it was more trouble than it was worth.
Coolness factor of purple motor oil was up there though.  Mobil 1 is more
than adequate for a VW engine - if it died with Mobil 1, Royal Purple would
not have saved it either.  So there.
