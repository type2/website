Subject: locating panel holes

Something to note when doing your own panels.
  If you use the original (old beater panels you
removed) as a template and you locate the fastner
holes
with the original pattern.... insure that you have the
orignal style clips as they are offset. In other
words,
the holes drilled in the panel doesnt line up with the
holes in the bus body.
  If you want to use straight through fastners that
are
more commonly available you need to make sure the
panel holes line up with the bus body holes (holes in
the metal)

  hole location in panel

          hole location in bus body.
Note the offset locationing of the holes.

hope this makes sense.
