Subject: Re: [T2] where's little buddy?

I bought a Mr. Buddy portable heater today and tried it out on the back
porch.  Bought at Lowe's formerly Eagle out here.  It lights right up and
seems really warm.  I was a bit alarmed by the bold notice &quot;DO NOT EVER USE
WHILE SLEEPING&quot;  and the frequent reminders that it is not vented and
requires 3&quot;x3&quot; open window space or death may occur.  I'm going to use it
tomorrow night IF I get my CO/CO2/Propane gas alarm installed during the
day.  Otherwise I'll be colder but will probably sleep better.
Still sorting through the recent postings about safety etc, myself.
