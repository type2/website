&gt; installing a dry plug in the head?

I've taken spark plugs out of my heads and found a considerable amount of
aluminum in the spark plug threads before I started using anit seize.
When I saw that aluminum I nearly went into a blind frenzy and had a
terrible attack of &quot;Paranoid Maintenance Syndrome&quot;.
This only happened after I got about 90 K on my heads and the spark plugs
were the unplanted type.
If anti-sieze isn't the solution, then we need to find one.
If just sparing use of anti-sieze (I always do) is the solution then I've
qualified with my recent policy of just a little dab and them wipe it
off.
Could the plating on the spark plugs previously installed make any
difference?
I'd sure rather have spark plugs that overheated and burned out than
spark plug holes without threads.
