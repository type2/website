well we're back. we drove 8905 miles through 25 states in 29 days. no problems
at all. camped in bus every night except when we stayed at someones house
(maybe 5 nights). slept in temps from 29(yellowstone)-100(las vegas).
synthetic oil worked the best. i think everyone should use it. i will write a
full report when i get a chance. hope everyone is well.

love
marty :)
