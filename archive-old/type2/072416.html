OK - I give... Help! I have a 2.0 liter Mark Stephens Statge I engine with 50k on it. Ignition is Crane Cams HI-6 and MSD Blaster 2 coil with solid 8mm Accel plug wires. About three weeks ago I replaced the alternator. Ever since, the engine started to develop a kind hesitation/surge at road speed and has progressively worked it's way down to idle. I replaced the air filter, fuel filter, points, plugs, cap, rotor (no condensor with Crane system). I replaced all the vacumn lines with new. checked for vacumn leaks all over the place with a can of starting fluid, all to no avail. Checked compression 1-120, 2-115, 3-110, 4-125, so I don't think I have burned valves. Plugs look picture perfect. Spark appears to be very hot. Fuel pressure registers at 32-34 lbs, fairly steady as I pressed accelerator. Dual relay checks out correctly. Checked polarity of coil connections. Checked ground connections for injectors. Cleaned and reinstalled positive leads at starter. Interesting note; wh!
en the car is idling, and it idles very rough, the voltage will fluctuate from time to time and lights will brighten slightly. The fluctuation is between 12.35 and 12.70 volts. The exhaust note has changed slowly as well. The engine still runs well at road speed with the exception of the noted hesitation/surge and no incredibly perceptatble loss of power. PLEASE RESPOND, EVEN IF YOU CAN'T HELP DO YOU KNOW A LINK WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT BE ABLE TO???
