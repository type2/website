Subject: SS muffler live and learn

found this interesting info

Second  Branch:

CHROMIUM  CONTAINING
The second branch also contain 12 to 18% chromium BUT
has a LOWER carbon level (less than 0.2%). Since the
carbon is low, these grades have a different
metallurgical structure and are called &quot;Ferritic&quot;
stainless steels. They have the following
characteristics:

 Are magnetic
 CANNOT be hardened by &quot;heat treatment&quot; (always
 used in the annealed or softened condition)
 Weldability is still poor



Common Uses:

  Automotive exhaust and fuel lines   ****BINGO****
  Architectural trim
  Cooking utensils
  Bank vaults
