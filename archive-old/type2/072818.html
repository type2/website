Tom:

Look at your oil pressure sender which is just in front of the distributor
(front is front) on top of the engine.  There should be a rubber boot
forming a little well.  If this area is filled with oil, your oil pressure
sender unit is leaking, which is an easy fix.  If you don't have the rubber
boot,check the area around the sender for oil, then make sure you replace
the boot when you replace the sender.
