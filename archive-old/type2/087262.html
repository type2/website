Subject: Engine Rebuild complete. a few post-rebuild questions


Hello list, 

Last weekend marked the end of my engine rebuild. This is a '75 Fuel
injected 1800cc in my '74 westy. complete as per the '75 (all FI
components are there except the EGR pump).

I got it all hooked up last week and She fired up on the first attempt (I
was shocked). I just have a few questions, this is the first time Ive done
this and I don't really know what to expect. I've been working on my
bus(es) for about 5 years, and now have done just about everything there
is to do (minus a transaxle rebuild). This is my first complete Type 4
rebuild.


I started it up and let it ran for 2- 4 minute periods. I wanted to
make sure
the timing was good and the valves were in spec. I really didn't think it 
would start so I hadn't made proper arrangements for the break-in process,
but that will take place next.

There was a bit of smoke coming out of the muffler, very subtle. I
didn'trealize it until I turned it off and looked around, there was
a very thin smoke. A tint of blue would suggest burning oil. 
I would expect there to be a bit right after the rebuild. 
the thing that worried me is that there was a little smoke coming out
of the fan shroud after i stopped it. Could be paint burnoff? I don't know
I painted everything with the correct paint, just seemd kinda quick for 
burnoff... the smoke did diminsh and was very thin. What could that be?
There is an exhaust leak between the muffler and left heat exchanger. a
bad one... Im waiting for a new one, but i don't think that has anything
to do with it. 

Could this be a mixture problem in the FI? where else could an exhaust
leak get into the fan shroud (the excahgers are not the problem)



Another thing.... this is, I used a different case that was machined. And
I had to reset the Pressure Relif. That said, each time I started the
engine, the oil light on the dash would stay on for about 3
seconds...flicker for 3 more and then turn off.... Again, I would expect
this... BUT it did it again the second time I started it the next da... Is
that right? Is the pressure relif not set correctly... or is it just oil
settling? This weekend I will be installing oil temp and presuure sender
to get a better picture. But i don't remember the light coming on every
time I started it up before the rebuild... but then again i don't know if
it even worked then...


Aside for the above everything sounded good. The engine ran real strong.
Heres a list of the parts that were replaced
Case (2.0 Case Machined)
Rings
All bearings
all case seals/gaskets
heads were rebuilt w/ new valves
shims

original parts used were
crank
cam
pushrods
lifters
pistons/cyls/pins
rods

this is by all means an abbreviated list.

I followed Bently and Haynes procedures for the rebuild. also read as much
as I could in the archive, and followed many list procedures.


Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I will start the breakin process
this weekend.


thanks
Eddie
'74 Westy - alive again.


P.S. Does anyone have a bracket for the Air cleaner in a FI bus that they
are willing to sell/donate. I need to weld one in, my bus didn't come FI.
