So this weekend I am planning to finally work on my bus after about a 
year without even spending more than an hour at a time under her 'hood'. 
Except for oil changes trying to fit those oil filter wrenches into the 
tiny space allowed for the filter, much less any wrech, in my bus.  
Anyway, I am going to insulate the pipe underneath and also the doors 
and such.  Now what am I supposed to use for this insulation?  When I 
first took the panels off in late '93 there were scraps of yellowish 
stuff in there, but I think that was more for sound reduction than 
anything else.  The regular pink panther itchy junk?  Is that thin 
enough to fit in the sliding door cavity?  Does it come in different 
thicknesses?  I haven't ever wandered the insulation isles at Menards...
