Subject: Dwell Creep

Drove my bus out from Albany NY to Ithaca this weekend to go camping.
Largely an uneventful trip - a good time camping and the bus ran great
- except....

Well the exhaust still chirps. Thanks for all the suggestions but I've
yet to locate the cause.

I noticed once or twice on the trip out the engine seemed to miss. I
really had a hard time figuring out if it really happened or if it was
just my imagination, as it only happened 2 or 3 times - only missing
for a split second - then continuing to run just fine.

So I stop in Binghamton on my way back to check things out.

First thing to check is the ignition. I check the dwell, ok around 42,
so I decide to regap my points. Get the dwell set around 48. Then I go
to do the timing - hmm, that's odd, I can't get a constant reading.
Timing seems to be jumping all over the place from 20-30deg BTDC.

Check the dwell again. Still fine 48. Throttle the engine - at 3000
RPM the dwell creeps up to 60!

This make it completely impossible to set my timing.

Luckily I have a spare distributor, drop in the 009, check the dwell,
set the timing, drive off into the sunset - no problems on the way
home. Actually the bus seems to run better with the 009 - something
I'll attribute to the fact that the other distributor is probably just
a piece of junk - not that the 009 is an ideal distributor.

The distributor I pulled was one of those junky Bruck models with the
good Bosch points (black and white wire).

What specifically would account for drifting dwell?

thanks
