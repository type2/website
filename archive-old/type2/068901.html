Subject: Engine won't Idle (71 Westy)

Hi there,
Well I have been trying to fix up the ole Westy for a trip in August. 
I recently redid most of the brake system. Replacing the vacume line 
to the brake booster fixed most of the idle problems, but she still 
won't keep an idle. I know the carb needs to be adjusted, but I am 
not really sure on the procedure. I have a 34 pict 3.... one problem 
is that all the vacume lines coming out of the carb have been screwed 
up, so I am not sure what plugs in where. 
Well that is my question, hope that you can be of help... I know that 
the most wise of vdubbers live on the other end of this list so I 
figure I can't miss.. :-)
Thanks 
Jay
