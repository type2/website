List,

i was just wondering what exactly is the cv.  My bus just recently started
making a loud clunking noise after traveling at higher speeds for a while.
Espeacially while accelerating.  Maybe i am having a similiar problem if
anyone can help me deterimine the culprit of my noise i would appreciate it.

&gt; Lately my right outer(I think) cv has been knocking loudly while driving,
&gt; happens mostly while decelerating. Is it harmful to the transaxle to drive
&gt; it like this? I got 4 days left till school is done before I have time to
&gt; fix it and I was kinda hoping I'd be able to make it to my final exams...
