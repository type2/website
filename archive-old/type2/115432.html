Subject: Re: [T2] looking for T2-microfiches

Seems like a bad idea akin to removing the copyright information and 
publishing it.

I tend to subscribe to the view that 'fair use' falls just short of making a 
profit from reselling.  I can loan a CD to my friends, can I not then loan a 
book to a select group of friends as well, especially one long out of print, 
and one never meant to be sold for publication in the first place?
