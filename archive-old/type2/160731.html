Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Temp Gauge Query

&gt; I have a VDO oil temp gauge here that I am interested in installing  
&gt; before I go to EveryBus.  There are three wires going into the  
&gt; gauge; one is marked as ground, one with a &quot;+&quot; and  one with a G.

It can't be much different than the aftermarket gauge:

&gt; Am I correct in assuming this is a powered gauge? I kinda expected  
&gt; it would have had a self-powered thermistor like the CHT does.

Yes. The resistance changes with temperature. Usually the NTC  
thermistor variety.

&gt; And finally: Does this gauge care how much wire is between it and  
&gt; the sender?

Nope, the resistance of the sender far exceeds the resistance of the  
wiring.
