On the same thread, how about the Stout Scarab, a bus like vehicle with a
rear mounted flathead ford and a wicker headliner?

&gt; 
&gt; OK, it's Friday and I figured maybe nobody would mind if I brought up a
&gt; low-VW-content topic. Besides, after this weeks long philosophical
&gt; questions about the dimples on golf balls, I thought I could be
&gt; forgiven.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my question for you VW historians out there: where did VW come up
&gt; with the idea for the VW transporter? I can't seem to remember seeing
&gt; any vehicles that were anything like it but earlier. Except for...
&gt; 
&gt; Buckminster Fuller's dymaxion car. This has become my automotive
&gt; obsession. Back in the early thirties, the guy who gave us the geodesic
&gt; dome designed a car that could carry eight adults, cruise at 140 mph,
&gt; and get 30 miles per gallon. He actually built several working
&gt; prototypes. The dymaxion car looks like a cross between a VW and a DC-3.
&gt; Imagine stretching out a split-window bus into more a teardrop shape.
&gt; The engine was in the back, where it drove a single, large wheel (It was
&gt; a three wheeler.). The rear wheel also was the steering wheel; it could
&gt; actually turn completely sideways, allowing the car to spin in circles
&gt; while the nose stayed in the same place.
&gt; 
&gt; I've only seen pictures of the dymaxion car, though there are a few in
&gt; museums around the country. I'm dying to see the interior of one.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I bring this up is because the dymaxion car was totally
&gt; unlike any car that existed at the time. Is it possible that the VW
&gt; engineers were tyring to achieve a slightly more conservative
&gt; interpretation of the dymaxion car? I thought maybe some folks on the
&gt; list might have seen info on VW's inspiration for the transporter.
