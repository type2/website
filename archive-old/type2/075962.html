&gt;Hey gang,

&gt;
&gt;       Does anybody know if a '73 1700cc dual carb bus
&gt;should have an air injection pump. The person who had
&gt;my bus before did some pretty sketchy work on it and
&gt;there wasn't one on there when he gave it to me. Could
&gt;this be real bad?

Yes, you should have one.  No, it's not really bad if it's missing - I took 
mine off over ten years ago.  Just make sure the holes are all plugged.
