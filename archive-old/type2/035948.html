Gentlepersons-
                     I tried the 800 # for the Airlift suspension package for 
VW. They weren't
in the office, but the computer took my # and Airlift left a message on my 
phone. So
far the package is for 60 to 65 beetles. That's the extent so far according 
to their
message. Has anyone else tried them? Offhand, it looks similar to other 
systems I've
seen advertised...in the two grand neighborhood.
