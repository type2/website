&lt;&lt;     From what I hear, 1974 had 1700 engines. I have a dual carbed 1700 
engine with an automatic tranny. This setup is completely bone stock!!!  &gt;&gt;

'74 Was a transition year with the early models having a 1700, midyear with 
1800 (both with dual carbs) and then there are a few rare 1974 fuel injected 
1800s, which I've only heard of and never seen.

The 1800 dual carbed engine seems to be the most common.
