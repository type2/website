&gt; VW Dealerships do not all come from the same mold. Black VW, the 
&gt; local dealer in Greensboro, does not have any air-cooled VWs for sale 
&gt; on the lot but none do :)

wanna cry, one of the oldest dealerships in Baltimore that actually had
air cooled parts recently had a major fire, what burned,  service dept and
storerooms  ;8*{

what started the fire,,, a Mercedes in the service dept having it's fuel
tank changed caught fire........

&gt; 
&gt; The VW parts manager, Steve Rogers, grew up in a 71 Westfalia and can 
&gt; even pronounce it correctly. Steve has all the old air-cooled parts 
&gt; books still on the shelf for reference and will gladly hunt through 
&gt; the VW nationwide online inventory searching for parts. Steve has 
&gt; even scrounged up odds and ends for my 67 bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I pulled up in front of the sales office one day and was greeted by 
&gt; an older salesman who immediately started telling me stories about 
&gt; his days driving a 1965 21 window. Meanwhile in the parts department, 
&gt; Steve quietly waits for someone to drop by so he show them his stash 
&gt; of NOS 6 volt type III gauges.
&gt; 
&gt; The service department really cannot do anything with your air-cooled 
&gt; vw but will happily keep your Vanagon running.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, this is not what you are likely to experience at a lot of VW 
&gt; dealers but I am glad that there is at least one left that has a 
&gt; local level that still respects its roots.
