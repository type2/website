YIKES&gt;....boy does that sound familiar ! Except noone flaged me down :(  I
had looked inside the bus and say the rubber latches were down, but it flew
off anyways.   Maybe they are fine as long as you dont have it on a
trailer....has anyone else had theirs fly off while just driving it ?

David, and to the others that remember his Westy pop top that became
missing in action...I made jokes with Stephen Gutknecht about that story
as he and I headed out for Clara's place to pick up her '66 Westy she was
selling.
We tie the top down before we leave to ensure we don't suffer the same
fate.
About 15 miles down the hiway...a guy flags us that the top is up on the
Bus!  After pulling over to a stop...sure enough...the top is up and the
tie down is gone.  Stephen and I both thought that was pretty damn funny!
Oh yea, we were towing the bus on a large flatbed trailer.
later
