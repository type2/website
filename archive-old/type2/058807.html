Subject: Re: Sender Wiring: Over or Under?

I ran mine under the crankcase and over to the driver's side,
putting it up over the top of any frame pieces as much as possible.
Reason I chose this route is that I alread had the cyl.head temp gauge
wire going that route (no other choice for it given the unchangeable
length of that wire).
     I tightened my bolts on the sump snugged up. Also had to put some
RTV silicon gasket goop on the threaded portion of the sender and the
nut on the other side, otherwise it leaked.
