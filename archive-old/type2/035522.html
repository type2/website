Subject: Re: [Re: Heater duct]

Gentlepersons-
                       ...a good plumbing supply house should have an 
adhesive backed, foil
faced insulation usually used to wrap heating ducts. The stuff is really 
tacky (sorry),
and as long as the metal is clean (no grease or oil)...even rusty, the stuff 
sticks and can be doubled over to increase insulating values. I hadn't 
thought about truck sized
flexible ducting...thanks for the tip. Mine is patched with stove pipe, pop 
riveted together to get the right size diameter. But I could use a better set 
of flexible bellows-
from the heat exchangers to the back of the &quot;Y&quot;, the plastic ribbed devices - 
for a '79
bus. Anybody got any extras?
