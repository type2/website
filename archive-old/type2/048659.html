Subject: [T2] Stock is cool

We did a s*baru 1800cc conversion and it is a lot of work to get it &quot;really

Most unexpected finding; the type 2 rolling chassis has very definite limits
and anything significantly over stock power will let you explore this
exciting domain , sometimes when you least expect it!
