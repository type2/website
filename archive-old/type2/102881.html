&gt; Hey there.
&gt;
&gt; Im trying to identify this bus.  I just bought it, more or less sight
&gt; unseen.  All i have are these pics.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the best I can tell, it's a '67 (the yard boss thinks).  I think
&gt; its a westy from pic 2 and pic 3.  you can see the short pop up
&gt; housing and the roof rack.  he also thinks it runs, but he does have
&gt; all of the 5 lug wheels and the engine appears to be complete.

'68  (pushbutton door handles..)

I suspect the poptop was grafted on, since the roof rack and roof vent are
aftermarket additions as well.  Interior looks like a normal passenger
bus.

&gt; i paid $500.  did i get robbed?

Not at all.

You may want to take this to type2_at_type2_dot_com though, before some of the
vintage naz..er..nuts here go crazy. :)
