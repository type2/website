&gt; What is another option for me to free rusty bolts?

Hi Paul!
I will recommend LPS #1, the equivalent to WD40. LPS
comes in different grades the higher the # the higher
the viscosity. LPS #3 I use to coat parts in airplanes
to prevent corrosion. You can find it in a auto parts
stores. If you have any problems getting it let me
know I can get you some from the store.
