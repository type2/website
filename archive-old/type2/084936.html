&gt;Okay, I've purchased the &quot;Headlight Conversion Kit, H4 Halogen, Set, incl.
&gt;12 v bulbs, 63-79 Bus, 80-85 Vanagon&quot;
&gt;http://199.217.241.240/partsimages/HQ6014.JPG from the bus depot. I plan on
&gt;wiring the relay system myself instead of shelling out $60 for a kit. Where
&gt;locally or online can I find:
&gt;
&gt;1. The male socket adaptor that will fit into the bus's existing headlight
&gt;socket ( this will trigger the new relays)
&gt;2. The connectors for the H4 headlights.

Just tap into the wiring between the existing relay and existing fuses... 
Then you can use insultaed male and female spade terminals. No wires cut, 
only one spade changed to insulated.
Just find the fuses for the headlights. When you turn the fusepanel over 
you will see that two of the fuses are connected by a &quot;bridge&quot; of copper. 
Electrically they come from the same source.

One will have a white wire and one will have a yellow wire. Just pull that 
wire off and use it to connect to the relay - you may have to create a 
small jumper wire as an extension. Use these wires to toggle the new relays 
and use the output of the new relays to connect to the fuse terminals that 
you took the yellow and white wires off of. This way the headlights are 
still fused in the normal way.

I can provide more detail if you like.

The new H4 headlights would then simply plug into the existing OEM sockets.

&gt;Is it true that the connectors are the same between the existing sealed beam
&gt;headlights and my new lights, so a person could just do a simple swap? I'm
&gt;not planning on doing this, I'm just asking the question.


Yes, and I did. Works fine.

&gt;Are there any advantages to running both the high and low beams during high
&gt;beam operation?


Yes - more light but I hear that this overheats the bulb and will shorten 
the bulb's lifespan.

Anyone else have an opinion or experience on this method?
