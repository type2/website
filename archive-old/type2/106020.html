Subject: Re: [T2] Broken into again. (fed up)

Hello All    There are a couple of things  they make a lock for the vents 
that can't be gotten into except by breaking the glass, detacting sound 
system is a good idea, I put all my goodies in the engine compartment that 
has a locking latch. nobody would know that they are there. The best was my 
90lb german shepherd  she was real!! later and have fun  see ya at EB2003
