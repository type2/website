Subject: Two questions---Keys &amp; Fuses

hello there
and thanks for taking the time to read this and lend a
hand...i am very new to VWs

first, someone posted about the fuses...i went
yesterday to the local auto parts store and bought the
same ones....the bently book says there are 2 types of
fuses(i have a 74 bus by the way) an 8 and 16 amp...

but it then says to replace the blues with blue ones
and the white with white ones....if they are both 8
amp why does the color matter?


second question: (and a two part one at that)
where do you suggest i get keys cut? my bus has one
key and i am having a hard time finding someone with a
blank to cut me a new one.....also, is the ignition
key the same as the door key? or where there 2 back
then....?

thanks in advance
