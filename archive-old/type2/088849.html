the repairs that everyone does, I decided to tackle something simple =
like changing the leaky valve cover gaskets on my 77 Riviera.  It went =
so easy that I decided to change out the gaskets on my bug, then take a =
really close look at both engines.  I cleaned off all the oil drippings, =
reattached a loose heater hose, and changed out a few dim bulbs.  I =
forgot how much fun it is to work on your own car.
