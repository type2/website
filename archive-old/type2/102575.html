 &gt; What I mean is you may not get a part that looks the same. You may get
 &gt; the right part but not the part you expected. I base this on eight years
 &gt; as a counter person.

 &gt; Ted :
 &gt; I respect your cautions on this acquisition.
 &gt; Some parts are just hard to get right because they are not &quot;most popular&quot;
 &gt; and can't be ordered from Vendors Web Sites. It takes at least a one on
 &gt; one telephone conversation to get the right parts. Historically it takes
 &gt; me 30 minutes on line to order this type parts order.
 &gt; My parts list is posted below:
 &gt; Here is what I need
 &gt; ---------------- #1 78 1800cc Type IV Bus Fuel Injection Engine

 Part of your problem in not getting the correct parts may be because you are not asking for the correct
application.
There is NO such thing as a factory installed 78 1800cc bus engine. A 1978 USA bus came with a GE engine which
is a 2.0L engine.
