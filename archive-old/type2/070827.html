Subject: 79 Westy w/ no automatic
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hey all- 
   Trying this again. first try came through blank?

   Went on a road trip to look at that 79 Westy today- the one that I was 
asking about the automatic. Turned out that it is NOT an automatic- was 
listed on Ebay incorrectly. I was quite surprised to see a clutch pedal!!
     I ended up being the high bidder- so I get to pick up the bus on Tuesday.
    I sure appreciate all of the automatic info- I feel like a shmoe that it 
wasn't needed though. Only thing I have to do to this bus is exhaust work- 
muffler really shot. 
   Also I will eventually need  child's cot &quot;poles&quot; - he has the cot itself, 
but lost the poles. 
   So- Anybody have any correct child's cot poles FS?  I will consider buying 
the whole cot setup if I have to.
     Lemme know please
   Brian
