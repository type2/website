Yes.  I actually removed a lot more than just a plug.

When I bought my '66 bus, the timing was set around 25 degrees btdc, there
was a paper towel stuck in the fan and the main jet was partially
obstructed with crud.  It had been running incredibly hot for quite some
time and the damage was already done.  Nevertheless, I decided to take it
on an 800 mi road trip.  You see, I was stuck in Georgia in the army at the
time and hadn't seen my girfriend (now my wife) in quite a while.  When she
came out to North Carolina to visit her brother, I wasn't going to let
something as simple as a trashed engine keep me from visiting.  

At around mile 100 the engine started ticking then squealing and finally
sort of a hammering.  Still making good power though.  I pulled over in a
rest area to investigate.  It was about 11:00 pm but dammit, I was on a
mission.  I slid a milk crate under the engine, flattened the tires
slightly to lower the bus and slid the engine out.  Upon teardown, I found
the problem.  #4 rod bearing had disinteragrated.  And no spare.  What to
do?  I removed that rod, piston,and two pushrods, hammered two bolts from a
muffler clamp into the oil holes in the crank, bolted it back together, and
grounded that plug wire.  Voila, a three cylinder. I topped the engine off
with 90 weight gear oil (only oil I had) and turned the key.  It ran! 

By this time it was about 4am. I continued down the road with a top speed
of about 35 mph.  The engine was laughably out of balance.  It felt like
the back of the bus was going to hop off the ground with each revolution. 
I made it to Waltherville (?) SC and temporarly abandoned my bus in favor
of Greyhound.  

The next weekend, I went to fetch my van.  I drove it 120+ miles back to Georgia
without incident.  And I continued to putt around town like that for
several months before I could afford a new long block.
