Subject: Installing an auxiliary blower in a '72 bus

Greetings all,
     Tonight, I plan to install my Attwood inline blower into the heating
system.  I plan to use the rear window defrost switch to operate the fan.
Any problem in doing this?  Should I install an aux. relay or just wire
directly to the switch?
Also, what is the recommended way to connect the fan to the stock heat tube.
I do plan to replace the tube in the future, but not tonight.  The stock
tube (the long one that runs the length of the bus) is in OK shape.  Any
pointers or insight will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
