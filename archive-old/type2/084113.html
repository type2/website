Subject: Bus visitors...

Hello to all;
   We had bus visitors this week, Ghislain and Marie-Josee from
Montreal, who are in the middle of a year long &quot;lap around America.&quot;
They are absolutely delightful company.

   They arrived Tuesday afternoon and about 7:30 p.m., while we were
finishing up supper, we got nailed by a monstrous South Texas
thunderstorm, complete with high winds (over 70 mph), assorted
tornadoes, hail and all the other bits that accompany such weather.

   We took refuge in the new part of our home, the part that is timber
framed (8x8 Douglas fir is tough stuff) just as the lights went out. Out
come the candles, oil lamps and conversation over bottles of Shiner
Bock. The storm raged on.

   Ghislain and Marie, natives of Montreal, had never experienced such
violent weather.

   The phones went out too and the water pressure dropped to next to
nothing. After the wind died down Ghislain assisted me in assessing the
damage. The roof of my shop was gone, the fence around the goat pen was
broken in places and the yard was a sea of broken limbs. We patched up
the fence, tossed a tarp over my soggy desk in the shop and went back to
the house for more beer. Yakked away for several hours and then went to
bed. We had them stay in the house because we didn't know if any further
violent weather was coming (didn't snap to getting the old battery
powered radio out until later).

   So the next morning, operating with no coffee, I wandered out to get
a clear picture of just how fooked up things were. Jeez, what a mess!
There was a branch stuck through the sliding door handle of Ghislain &amp;
Marie's bus.

   While Kathy went to town to find hot coffee and breakfast items,
Ghislain, Marie and I started cleaning up the trashed yard (mostly
mesquite limbs infested with thorns). They were enthusiastic volunteers
and in a few short hours the yard was mostly cleared of thorny stuff.

   Then we toured the area to check out the damages. Ouch. Neighbors'
houses were completely trashed, huge trees were ripped out of the
ground, barns flipped over, dozens of power poles snapped off at the
base. One neighbor lost a bunch of new barns, several high $$$ horses
and foals, another neighbor had goats missing, as well as a tractor that
had been moved 100 feet, 1500 lb round bales of hay blown up against the
back of the house after moving 100+ feet.

   In general, this neck of the woods was trashed. The water came back
Wednesday afternoon after the water company got a humongous generator
for the well pump. Didn't get phone and electricity back until after
Ghislain and Marie left. Booted up the 'puter and, man, you guys are a
busy bunch! 240+ from the Type2 list.

   Ghislain and Marie left yesterday headed for Corpus Christi and Padre
Island after which they plan to head west, Del Rio, Amistad, Big Bend,
New Mexico and onward, eventually, to the west coast and upward toward
Canada.

   If any of you along the way want a couple of visitors for a night or
two, let me know and I'll pass the word along to them. They are mostly
sticking to national parks and forests, Walmart parking lots and the
occasional motel for a break. They have a loose itinerary with a few
planned stops and no real schedule except getting back to Montreal by
September. Their native language is French, but they are doing pretty
good with English. We had fun with the differences between South Texas
pronunciation and their take on things.

   Through storm, cleanup, no lights, cold showers and all, they never
stopped smiling, always pleasant to be around, good conversation on a
variety of subjects...in short great company. They are vegetarians, but
aren't militant about it...you know, spaghetti without the meatballs.
They didn't care when I had to get a bit of fish in my system Wednesday
night.
