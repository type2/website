ent to pick up a set of softer pads that the anti-noise shims (which were 
missing when I bought the bus) never really worked.... softer pads was the 
solution.... well it's not in this case. Last week my son knew I was coming 
home cause he could hear the brake squeal about a quarter mile away. Stealth 
Vanagon it isn't.... 
In the archive I read about some goop to put on the pads. Name brand? Does 
the stuff really work? Is there another solution? Till whenever if you hear 
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, it's me coming.

Perhaps we could get together sometime and play harmony coming off a
mountain.........

My 81 is the same way and I do have the anti-squeal shims. The goop is by Napa
or any number of others, pretty stand ard flaps fare. In my case it only
worked for a few weeks. Joel Walker recommended filing/rounding off the edges
of the pads but I haven't tried it for lack of interest.

BTW, I do find that when it squeals, if I pump the pedal once it stops.
Something reorients itself I guess.
