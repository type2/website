Jake Vincent,
There was a split featured in Volksworld, July issue, which looked beautiful. 
The lower half was 'rainbow blue' which is like that deep sky colour you get
when it's clear and dry.  The upper half was bright white (like clouds in
above sky with sun shining on them).  That was be a cool colour scheme IMHO. 
I think bluish green (turqoise?) is a great colour for buses also, again with
a white top half.
