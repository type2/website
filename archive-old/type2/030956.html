I don't have the cross reference for the numbers but sounds like you got a
BN-6  great little heater, hang on to it with your life.  I don't have
specs for it, I have the wimpy little 4 and it will heat me out.  there
are a number of members of the list that have the manuals for that heater
and will have you like toast by Sept.
