Subject: Engine Seal Replacement

Howdy All --
After seeing all this talk about hot engines, missing tin and engine
compartment seals, that brought up a question that's been bouncing around
in tmy head for awhile.  My engine compartment seal is pretty much intact
for the most part -- I say &quot;for the most part&quot; because there is one section
on the left side where my aux. battery dumped over a couple of years back
and spilled battery acid, causing some gradual deterioration of the foam
seal; the seal is still there, but a small section of it is now at the
point where it's got some holes and is getting thinner; there is not a
complete seal in this one 4-6 inch area.  I'm just wondering if this small
patch of bad engine compartment seal could yet be affecting the coolness of
my engine (I haven't detected that it's running any hotter than usual), and
I also want to install a new seal ASAP anyway -- is this a very difficult
procedure?  Seems like it would be -- since the seal seems to wrap all the
way around the back of the engine where things are hard to get at -- but I
just thought I'd ask the experts.  Thanks for any help you can provide!
