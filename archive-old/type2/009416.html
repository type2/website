Jan:

We looked at a Bus sitting out back to see how to reach that hose.  If you
can remove the firewall panel or get it out of the way you may be able to
get to it without removing the engine.  The Bentley book says that you do
have to remove the engine.

Once you get to it, you can remove the three bolts that hold the filler to
the body, loosen the hose clamps on the hose in the engine compartment and
then pull the filler from the body from the outside.  You should then be
able to remove the hose from the tank inside the engine compartment.

Safety warning:  Make sure the tank is only about half full or less and NO
SMOKING!

Thank you!

 OK, next question. How do I get to it to see if it is not cracked or
 leaking? I suppose the hose is more or less straight and not bend like on
 later ones (that have the round inspection lid in the engine compartment).
 
 BTW, A lot of bad things have been said about Bus Boys in the past. Until
 recently they never posted anything to the list. However over the last
 several weeks I have seen several useful responses to various questions. I
 would say that's an encouraging sign. Keep up the good work!
