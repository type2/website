&gt;I'm wondering, cause by what I see when I remove the
&gt;cover for the oil strainer is well, no sign of an oil
&gt;stainer!  The engine is newly rebuilt from Bus Depot
&gt;(AVI I think).  It's a great engine.  It's my first
&gt;2000 with FI (76 drive train).  Is the strainer
&gt;missing if it doesn't come right out when I remove the
&gt;cover?  Does anyone have drawings of the this engine
&gt;area so I see what it SHOULD look like? Or is it in
&gt;the Bently Manual and I've really just blind? LOL

The strainer is behind the plate with the one bolt and is between the plate and the oil pickup tube.  This is the plate with the bolt that requires the magic 9 ft.lbs. of and not an inch more!

In my picture you can see a new strainer, two new gaskets, and a new aluminum crush washer.  The old crush washer is on the bolt to the right and the old gaskets (black) are in the background of the picture.

The other plate, as mentioned in the other reply, has two small 10mm bolts.  Nothing is behind this plate except a $6 O-ring. Although it can be used for inspection purposes this other plate is usually used as a mount for an oil temp sender (you have to shorten the length of the stock oil dipstick a little I'm told).
