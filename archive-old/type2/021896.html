Subject: Rear Bench Seat Install?


Afternoon everybody:

I just acquired a rear bench seat from what I think was a '76 bus, and am looking to put it in my 69

Transporter.  I'm no expert on rear seats (never having had one before)...Looks to me like the
bottom will fit fine, but the backrest half is a bit different in that it folds down (whereas the
original 69 seat did not?)  The backrest has two little hooks on the top rear that would keep it
upright.

Question: Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do) with regards to attaching something to the
interior frame which these hooks could grab onto?  I can't even find a mid-model bay around here
so's I can look and see what's what...

I'm thinking just hold out for the proper-year rear seat, but these things are tough to find and my
bus
looks really happy with an (unbolted) rear seat in it...
