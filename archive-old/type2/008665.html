Hello Everybody!

The caterpillar  has  not become a butterfly yet but I am working on it!

The interior is a from a 1969 Westfalia and was generously  donated by
listee DocRic. The recipient  is our beater 72 microbus. There only real
computability  issue arises with the closet floor clearing the filler neck
bumpout  and that issue will be resolved with a jigsaw.

 Since our last installment  a lot of progress has been made. The first step
was to strip the 72 passenger interior out. That was easily  accomplished
but  revealed the horror of the next step. The floor was a mess. I was a
mish mash of surface rust, spilt motor  oil, hay, and good old fashioned
dirt. Yuck!!!!! I had to wait for some nice weather  to arrive to tackle
this monster.

After a lot of head scratching I went to work with soap and water to clean
the mess up. It took hours of scrubbing with rags, sponges and Q-tips. but 
it was amazing how  nice  it looked when it was finished. Of course there
were still the rust spots to deal with.

Rust was dealt  with by some 100 grit paper and everyone¹s best friend,
POR15. It was always my intention to paint  the whole cargo floor with POR15
because  I am gonna put a some manner of camper floor in there. It was a
hell of a lot of work to be covered up but if you are gonna do it you might
as well...........

The next phase was to replace the stock passenger bus interior  panels with
something a little more yachty. I went  with1/8² birch ply  in the 4x8¹
sheets. This is available just about anywhere but quality  varies. The old
panels  were used as template  for the new birch and it was a simple  matter
of tracing them out and enlisting the aid of Chad and his table saw to
finish up this phase.

The newly cut panels  rattled around in the back of the bus for a week or so
until more time and good weather were on hand. Today  was the day. It was a
royal pain in the ass to drill holes to match the existing fastener holes
and I will spare you all the details  but measure 300 times and drill once 
is the rule of thumb :) With a hour or two of daylight  left I went ahead
and applied some of good old Homer Formby¹s Tung oil to the panels  and I
gotta say that I like the look. Tomorrow  I will hit it with some 0000 steel
wool and apply another  coat.

In other interior  news, I finally found some groovy fabric for the bed and
jumpseat . This was purchased at  the Fabric Center in Walkertown, NC. TFC
is a crazy  place that buys out old outdated stuff and crams  the shelves
with it. There is some  really  cool old stuff in there and I went thru
every bolt looking  for Westy  vinyl and curtain material l but no luck. 

I am gonna get this thing done  in time for EveryBus
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~vw69bus/everybus/everybus.html
where I will pick up some Jals and a child cot for Stella to sleep in. I
hope to have it  finished and looking Bristol  for that crown jewel of
camping: High Country Bus Festival. http://members.aol_dot_com/docric/highc.html
