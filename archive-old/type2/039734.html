if rational is the important thing then your daily commute would be on the
local public transit authority.  In the Fatherland Public transit is king,
because of the auto tax system and high fuel costs (I lived there and
owned a VW, and my insurance was unbelievable, not to mention the safety
inspections and the vehicle registration costs and the gas taxes etc, etc,
etc
&gt; 
&gt; It's reason=value for me, not money=reason. 
reason=value rules against ANY privately owned motor vehicle in almost
every case.

&gt; I know I'm in the minority in
&gt; this view. It doesn't follow that I will shut up 'cause the majority may
&gt; not appreciate my method. 

don't want you to shut up, but realize that we have a capitalistic system
of government and manufacturers try to meet the demands of the &quot;customer&quot;
and this is the key the &quot;Customer&quot;  

all design is a compromise, trying to get, value, low price, safety,
appeal, reliability, ease of repair, compliance with regulations, etc,
etc, etc.

the customer ALWAYS wants it yesterday for less than cost and perfect
performance.  an engineer is always trying to stuff 10 lbs of S**t into a
5lb bag.  it is the nature of the beast, and any parent will tell you, 47
cup holders are mandatory..

then throw in non standard uses, for example I drive with hand controls.
this is a severe modification of the system...changes the whole equation,
and VW actively courts this market (including a $1500 rebate over and
above what you can get from the dealer).

&gt; If a client comes to me and says, &quot;Make this wizbang work, damn the
&gt; cost!!&quot;, I give them the following condition of my employment. I will

the difference, as an engineer I get the project rather as &quot;Make this
work&quot;  and it is up to me (us) to figure out &quot;how&quot; not if..(remember the
customer pays the freight)  I don't design cars, thank god, but rather the
public transport systems.  Take the project in the North East (BTW I was
one of the folks that worked on the TALGO, operating in your neck of the
woods) the high speed ACELA train that will go into service this
summer...I started working on that project in 1979, and finally seeing it
come to fruition this summer.  The train will operate at 135MPH, the track
that we put it on was not capable of running this train at this speed, THE
folks in the Fatherland told us so, along with the Japanese, and French
and British, but our orders were &quot;make it so&quot; and I think the team did a
pretty fair job.  The American bullet train will be the best there is, bar
none.  What does this have to do with VWs, well it is a few minutes before
midnight on Friday and I wanted to explain a little bit about &quot;Design and
engineering&quot; from the Engineers perspective.  since I build railways
rather than automobiles I had to use examples I know. but building 135MPH
12,000 hp trains is pretty much the same concept as building a 65hp VW
bus.

if it were not for customer demands we wouldn't have many of the advances
in auto engineering.  the automatic transmission was designed so that cars
could be sold to women, seems in those days they didn't think women could
drive a stick shift. well the premise was wrong but the product was
competent...and so on and so forth, some products are frivilous, but they
are different for different people, my frivolous is your &quot;must have&quot; 

opps the clock just struck midnight so I will roll down off the soapbox
for now.
