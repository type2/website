Subject: Disc brake servo vacuum


&gt;
&gt; The brake servo only affects the disc brakes.  Technical references tell
me that
&gt; the line the runs from the port off of the servo goes to the vacuum pipe
off of one
&gt; intake manifold on the engine.  There is supposed to be a check valve that
goes
&gt; between intake manifold and the vacuum line.  The purpose of the check
valve is to
&gt; prevent pressure caused by potential backfires from reducing the vacuum
&gt; efficiency.

The check valve holds vacuum in the booster circuit. When you accelerate,
manifold vacuum drops to near zero. Without the check valve, booster vacuum
would go to near zero and you would loose boost. Also without the valve, you
would have to wait too long for the vacuum to recover after one use of the
brakes. With the valve and 15-18&quot; of vacuum, you would have about 3
applications of the boost after the engine is off. Without the valve, you
loose vacuum immediately when the engine stops.


&gt; What I'm alittle confused about is why there are intake manifolds without
that
&gt; vacuum pipe (there also sold with the vacuum pipe), unless there are
alternate
&gt; vacuum sources that can be used such as the fan shroud..

Type1 engines use the same intake, but they don't have power brakes. So they
don't need that vacuum pipe. The bug with auto-stick shift used the intake
with the vacuum pipe. Type 2's in the US only had power disc brakes and an
upright engine for one year. Dual port intakes in bugs were used for 4
years? [I think 71 to 74?]

&gt; My fan shroud has several
&gt; extra openings.  One opening has a round nipple that appears to match the
I.D. of
&gt; (my) the vacuum hose.  That diameter is about twice that of the vacuum
pipe from
&gt; the intake manifold.  I would think that the vacuum produced within the
shroud
&gt; should always remain constant (when running) and would not require that
check
&gt; valve.

Vacuum in your fan shroud???  No, maybe a 'low pressure area' but not
vacuum.
