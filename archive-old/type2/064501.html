Subject: Latest Mothership Trip Report

        Well, since the Mother an I made our aquaintance we have been on many short journey's together.  The latest being a trip down to Southern Georgia.

        I am a consultant for National Service and other non-profit programs.  I had a gig to do in Americus, Georgia for Habitat for Humanity.  In doing some research on the area I found that Andersonville, Georgia was close by.  This community was the location of the infamous POW camp during the Civil War.  

        The city is located on the &quot;blue highways&quot; of rural southern Georgia, and in all reality is nothing more than a spot in the road.  But, since the Federal Parks Service came in and started renovations on the camp, and Ted Turner saw it in his heart to make a movie about the event, they seem to be economically proud these days.

        Hey it's not all communities that have something so terrible to be proud of and at the same time create solid economic growth.  

        Anyway, I left Atlanta on Friday afternoon, I took I-75 down to state road #36, cut over to Barnesville and proceeded south on Highway 19.  This route takes you through the clay hills of west Georgia.  The land changes when you get below Thomaston.  The clay hills gradually metamorphisise into long flat stretches that not only lets you listen to the comforting humm of a clean operating pancake, but also to the wind.  I say this not because this is so peaceful, but because they ain't a damn radio station down there worth talking about!

        I arrived in Andersonville on Friday evening.  There is a city-owned campground in the community so that is what I found first.  The park was already closed for the day, and since it was getting dark fast, I figured I would be best to set up.

        The resuraunt beside the camground had an all you can eat catfish special going, so I decided not to cook, and gorge myself on the whiskered delight.  If you have never tried this &quot;delicacy of the common man&quot; you should.  It is just plain good eatin'.  

        Through dinner I sat at the waitress table, that way you always get some conversation if you are traveling alone (usually honest and plain, although 9 times out of 10 not very learned).  We talked of Habitat and whether it was a good organization or not.  They were of the opinion that if it didn't do anything for them then it wasn't worth it's salt.  We talked about Friday nites in Andersonville and how little there is to do.  

        She spoke of her three ex-husbands and the fact that they were all scum and she despised them all becuase they let her down.  We talked about how she had four kids, lived in a house trailor, and drove a 72 Nova that she bought brand new, and how it had one time taken her to California to find a new life that she never really found, so she came back home to live with her mother who had alos recently become divorced. 

        I am of the different opinion, but to each his/her own. 

        The POW camp is amazing.  This camp was designed for 10,000 prisoners, and ended up housing 21,000.  You can read more about this atrocity of war in John Ransom's Diary.  he was a POW that kept a daily account of his experience.  

        In one part of the book he describes where his lean-to was.  I found what I believe is this spot and sat down.  I saw the creek named Sweetwater, yet during this time it was so polluted with human waste that if you drank from it it would mean almost sure death.

        There was something to learn from this place, something that is still there.  I sat and listened to the silence that was once a hustle of conversation created by captive men.  I could imagine the grassy field I sat in as nothing but trampled muck.  I know what it feels like to be in south Georgia in the summer, and for these men it must have been awful.  No shade to be found.

        The camp didn't have a fence around it, there were posts, Two rows of them.  The first was the warning row.  The second was called the Dealine.  In the book it is said that many of the men would become lethargic in the heat, and through there confusion wander over into the deadline.  They never came back.  Ransoms describes it as a relief, rather than a pity. 

        From where the men were encamped, you could look out across a vast expanse of meadow, at that time it was nothing but fields, some farmed some not.  I believe if I would have been there, the thing most dificult to fight would be the fact that there were no hard touchable boundaries.  Yet at the same time I would be a captive.

        The Mothership ran like a charm.  On the way back, I stopped at a &quot;Flying  J&quot; truckstop and spent the nite.  I was only forty miles from home, but what the hell.  In a few months I will be living out of my bus anyway, and needed the practice.

Well thats my story, thanks for reading it.

        I know sometimes my stray a bit off the beaten VW path, but I am not the cartalk type yet.  I kinda think that it relates mainly because a 1979 VW Bus w/ custom camp interior, takes me to these places.  But then I have always been the kind that goes around my elbow to get to my hand.  : )  

Thanks, 
Charlie Ford
