&gt;&gt;On the same heads?
&gt;
&gt;No, roughly 20k on 1 set, 15k on another set, and 55k on the latest set.

Hmmmm.

&gt;Come to think of it, the very first set of heads I had on the
&gt;bus experienced a catastrophic failure (exhaust valve snapped in two) but I
&gt;had the EGR *connected* when that happened.  Go figure?

I guess. Your cooling fan was running as well, we can blame the fan if we
want to. 8) It's impossible to prove this stuff, at least with obsolete
cars, all you can get is theory on the one hand and anecdotes on the other.
But we spend so much effort trying to run cooler, then somebody invents a
device that lowers combustion temps substantially AND reduces emissions AND
improves mileage, with no side effects, and everybody thinks it doesn't
matter if you disconnect it.

But woe be unto him who doesn't have an engine compartment seal.

Did I tell you about my chrome power pulley? =^ )
