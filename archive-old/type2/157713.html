&gt; Hi all,

There is lots of data about tires in the archives, and it is a bit of a
religious subject.  Availability is also an issue, with different brands
coming and going.  The current &quot;hot&quot; tire is the Hankook, but there are
also offerings from Bridgestone, Michelin, etc.  I'm using some
cheap-but-correctly-rated Chinese tires labeled &quot;Westlake&quot; that are
working well for me.

White walls?  Not likely!
