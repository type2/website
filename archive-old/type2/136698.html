Subject: Re: [T2]toggle radio question

A single pole dual throw (spdt) switch should do what you need. Draw
power via the key switch for one side and off the fuse panel directly
for the other side. The shared pole goes to your radio. I can't think of
a good reason to run the ground through the toggle, but then I'm a
dilettante with things electric. For the headphone amplifiers I build, I
run both through the switches, using dual pole versions.

Two other options spring to mind:

Bypass the key switch and wire the radio in classic VW fashion. Turn it
on and off as you wish.

Get a late model Blaupunkt. The one I currently have turns on spurious
of the key, but also turns on with the key -- providing the radio's power 
switch is on. It runs for an hour and shuts itself off to help prevent
you from running your battery down.
