Subject: Re: [T2] Wire Disconnected from Fuse Box



Steven,

Thanks for your reply.

Are you saying that the solid brown wire will connect to either 5 or 31 in
the fuse box?

This clarifies things a bit for the headlights, but I still do not know how
to read this from the Bentley book.  As I explained, there is a solid brown
wire just dangling down near the fuse box, which I think should be
connected somewhere.  Does Bentley's wiring diagram show where to put this?
If so, where do I find it and how do I read it?

A few details which may help:
- The lights currently work only on high beam, but used to work perfectly.
- I currently have no click, but can get it when I touch the brown wire
directly to the fuse #4 or 5 or so.  Still no light flicker, however.
- There is a dis-connected brown wire dangling near the fuse box, waiting
to be plugged somewhere

* There is a 2nd wire disconnected, which is either White/Grey with Black
lines, which splits and appears to run into the Yellow emergency flashers.
This still work, and I didn't begin to look at this wire yet.  It *might*
be related to headlights, but I doubt it.  For now I will fix the
headlights first.
* P.S. the right reverse light is buggy, but didn't get to it either.
Perhaps a bulb or disconnected wire in back.  Other than that all is good.
I will check this after the headlights are fixed.

All help is appreciated, Thank you.
