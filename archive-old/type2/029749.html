&gt; &gt;    I just put the leads of my multimeter into a blob of copper based 
&gt; &gt; antisieze and did not get a continuity reading.  I guess it's not conductive 
&gt; &gt; after all.
&gt; 
&gt; right, the solids are &quot;encapsulated&quot; in a nonconductive carrier
&gt; 
&gt; I have been testing GB Ox-Gard on some of my connectors (one side with one
&gt; side without) so far the jury is still out

Conduction is ensured through good metal-to-metal contact.  The purpose of
whatever goop you put on the connection is to exclude air and water, which
will corrode the metals.

Truly conductive greases and sealants are few and far between.  Most are
graphite-based and quite messy.  You really don't want to use them except
in specific applications!
