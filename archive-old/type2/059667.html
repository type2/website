i have a 72 sunroof, but no seal at all....i have tried the archives and the
bus depot but couldnt find anything on the subject, (or a seal) can someone
explain to me how the thing seals up?and where i can find whatever it is

(the PO just duct taped it shut) whatever works for them, but not on the new
paintjob...
