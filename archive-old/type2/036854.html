Subject: CO too high with dual carbs

To the gurus of the list:
I just failed my emissions inspection because the carbon monoxide 
was a few tenths of a percentage point too high. 

I have a type IV engine with dual PDSITs. I am not familiar with
these carbs. Which adjustment should I make to lower the CO?
Should I go through the entire tune up procedure, or will a simple
slight adjustment lower the readings?
