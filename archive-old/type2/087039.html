hmmmm, I have a BA-4 in my van (from a 412) but I removed the regular heat
and rely on the BA-4 for all my heat....does that now make it a BN-4????

&gt; &gt; I took a load of pictures at Stanford Hall this year and have posted a
&gt; &gt; couple of pages with the better ones on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Visit: http://www.pagenumberone.co_dot_uk/veedubs/index.htm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; to have a look. Warning: lots of pictures so slow downloads expected.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One of the pictures shows a couple of heaters (BA2 &amp; 6). Question: what
&gt; &gt; would I need to add to the BA2 to make it work and will it heat my bus ?
&gt; 
&gt; Philip,
&gt; 
&gt; The picture, heaters.jpg, shows a BN-4 and another heater.  This second
&gt; heater is one I have not seen before, but from its design, it could well
&gt; be a BA-2.  The &quot;secret decoder ring&quot; for Eberspacher heaters is, as I
&gt; understand it, as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 1st character B or D = benzin (gasoline) or diesel
&gt; 2nd character N or A = New or Assist (In German, of course :-)
&gt; 3rd character = heat output in thousands of Btu/hr
&gt; 
&gt; New vs. assist has to do with whether the heater sits in the  existing
&gt; heater pipe and adds its heat output to the existing heater system or
&gt; whether it sits outside the existing heater system.  Looking at that
&gt; second heater it looks as tho it is designed to sit inline with the main
&gt; heater tube that runs under your bus, so it would be an &quot;A&quot; and given the
&gt; small physical dimensions, 2K Btu looks right to me (the BA-6 is *much*
&gt; larger!)
&gt; 
&gt; The main limit on installation is whether all the control cables and
&gt; wiring are present.  If they are not, making them up can be trying.  With
&gt; the BN-4, be aware that you will need to cut the cover over the gas tank
&gt; and cut a hole in the body under the rear bench seat.  For occasional
&gt; extra heat, the BA-2 will probably be easier to install and will provide
&gt; plenty of heat.
