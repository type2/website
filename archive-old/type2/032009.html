My goodness! You intend to install the motor and tranny already bolted 
together as one unit? Why?

Since each one weighs quite a bit and together they weigh QUITE a bit, I 
recommend installing them one at a time.

Bolt the auto tranny in first. Alone, it is light enough that you should 
be able to perch it on the circular lift part of a modest sized (not the 
smallest size) floor jack. You could probably design some kind of clever 
cradle for the thing, but I found that with only one extra person to 
help me I could get mine in pretty easily. One person operates the jack 
while the other stabilizes the tranny on the jack. Once it's high enough, 
the other person stabilizes while you bolt in. I took one out and put it 
back in this way. It's pretty straightforward and no one busted any 
knuckles doing it.

Similarly with the engine. Both lift it onto the jack. One stabilizes it 
and goes under the bus with it while the other rolls the jack and jacks 
up when needed. Then the other person stabilizes while you fish around 
to  get the rear mount bolts in and the front mount bolts in. It takes 
ten minutes and not an awful amount of grunting and groaning. I've done 
this several times.

John Muir describes a more elaborate method with two jacks and lumber 
between them to make a cradle, but that's twice as many jacks to control. 
I see no reason to do it.

Once the engine and tranny are in, you have to bolt the torque converter 
to the engine (you put the torque converter in place on the tranny after 
the tranny was in and before the engine went in, right? Right? :-). Many 
have described this procedure as a PITA and I suppose it is, but only a 
small one. Again you need two people. Ten minutes will do it. You lie 
inside the bus facing rear, looking into the top of the engine 
compartment. Your asistant slowly turns the engine with a wrench on the 
alternator bolt while you stick your finger in the access hole in the 
bell housing, top, driver's side. Carefully (so no one pinches a finger) 
you feel when the holes in the flywheel come around. And you insert the 3 
bolts that hold one to the other, tighten 'em with a socket wrench on an 
extension, and you're done. 

The only reason I can imagine to bolt tranny and engine together before 
going into the bus is to save you this last step. But it's not a hard 
step and you make every other step considerably harder if you bolt engine 
and tranny together before installing. It's like going to an awful lot of 
trouble to spare yourself one minor task.

However you go about it, good luck and be sure about your jackstands 
before you get under that bus.

Drive safely,
