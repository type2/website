&lt;&lt;  a good troubleshooting guide to Type IV oil leaks. Especially if it
 had a good, complete decision tree. If someone on the list has the
 experience to work this out, and it is reviewed by a couple of our list
 gurus, I would gladly pay about $10 to have it sent as an attached file. I
 bet other people would, too. 
 
 Quick cash for somebody!

 now tuned for operating his '76, but it's piddling all its oil!

There's really not a lot to leak under the type 4 engines.  Places to check.
Valve covers
Oil strainer and drain plug
Oil filter
Mechanical fuel pump if it has one
Dip stick tube

That extra little plate under the engine with two bolts that the name escapes
me.
Here's the stuff that's a little harder to get to and some parts may need to
be removed to fix it.
Push rod tubes (just a couple of pieces of tin, valve covers, and rockers)
Crank seal (gotta pull the blower)
Fly wheel seal (gotta pull the engine-bummer huh?)
Oil cooler seals (left intake (might as well do them both Left and right
intakes), left cylinder tin

One of the best ways I've found to track down oil leaks is to power wash your
engine and place a large piece of cardboard under it.  You can even use a
piece of string to help pin point things.  Hold the string in the middle of
your oil spot and pull the string until it's going straight up.  This is where
your oil is dripping, but no necessarily leaking, follow it from there.
  Peace, Love, and your monies no good here-spend it on gaskets,
