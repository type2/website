Subject: Melling oil pumps and type IV motors

&quot;I called Melling and spoke them. I received a Melling catalogue #33103-1
today, and there is no listing for an oil pump for any type IV motor. They
list 8 pumps for various type 1 motors, covering pretty much every model,
6mm studs, 8mm studs, and several pump volumes.&quot;


Thats pretty much what I found out myself in my whole oil pump debacle.
Though in speaking with Bus Depot they assured me that the Melling they
sell is a direct replacement with no need for modifications. I ended up
getting a Schadek from Aircooled. net mostly because I have heard a lot of
praise for those pumps and it was aluminum like the original whereas the
Melling is cast iron. I have not yet installed the pump and am planning on
renting/buying the tool from Aircooled_dot_net to resurface my oil pressure
relief bores along with replacing the pump and adding a cooler. I would be
interested to hear from folks who have bought the Melling pump from BD,
especially to know if it really was plug and play.
