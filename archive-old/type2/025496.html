&gt; I'm going to rebuild my 1600dp as a 1776cc with a warm cam (Engle 110),
&gt; stock heads. I intend to fit twin Kadrons &amp; a 'Empi Monza' 4 tip exhaust
&gt; that I got _at_ vanfest last week. I would VERY much like to get an CIS FI
&gt; system set up from a Golf (rabbit) etc....
&gt; 
&gt; Any tips on building this type of engine would be great, I only want to do
&gt; this once! Advice on components etc is cool too!

Lessee...

1. Use a new case. Accept no substitutes...
2. Find a machinist that's done the case and head clearancing before, get
references, ask them if they were satisfied.
3. If you can't find a machinist in the local area, send the case and heads
to either Rimco or Painter's Grinding.
4. John Connolly advises that Web-Cam camshafts are very fine.
5. People advise you to have new exhaust valves installed. I figure that as
long as you're in there, replace all eight valves. The upcharge isn't that
great.
6. Pay special attention to your oil system. Your Type 1 engine holds 2500ml
of oil the way it sits. That's enough oil for a 1600. For a 1776 it's not.
Add a 1.5-quart sump to this engine. Also have the case drilled &amp; tapped for
full-flow oiling.
