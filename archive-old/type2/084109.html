Subject: CV joint troubles and history lesson...


Been reading the recent posts on replacing CV joints with interest as I've spent the last 4 weekends
battling a loud click that is now a louder clunk.

I'm now a pro at this job as I've pulled, regreased and reinstalled all four joints.  The first one
took me about 10 hours (no, really - it took several hours for it to dawn on me that if I put the
car in neutral and took off the parking brake, I could spin the joint around enough to get at the
rest of the bolts...I can be REALLY slow sometimes...) but by the fourth one I had it down to an
hour.

So my drivers side outer joint was really chewed to bits.  I went out and bought two more (one for
road backup, as the list advises...), replaced the offending joint, and man, if that clunk didn't
get LOUDER.  Now I've removed and reinstalled the joint twice to no avail.

This weekend I'm gonna do some serious thinking about it.  What could be loose?  Dirty?  Could a bad
CV joint mess up some other nearby component like brakes or wheel bearings?

It's getting to the point where people on the street say &quot;Hey, how are you?&quot; and I start in with,
&quot;Well, there's this clunk...&quot;

HISTORICAL ANECDOTE:  I'm currently rereading Dava Sobel's book &quot;Longitude&quot;, which is the story of
the Englishman John Harrison's attempts to make a seagoing clock in the mid-1700's.  In the midst of
my CV joint misery I read the following:

&quot;A novel antifriction device that Harrison developed also survives to the present day - in the caged
ball bearings that smooth the operation of almost every machine with moving parts now in use.&quot;

Maybe I should ask him about that clunk...
