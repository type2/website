Subject: Re: [T2] Catalytic converter flow only one way?

I would have to say that the manufacture of that converter probably has
built a few of them and more than likely knows much more on where or why
the insides are the way they are , and for what reason.

Now--if I had any second or third thoughts on how it was built, and if
in fact that arrow meant anything, I'd be on the phone right this second
talking with who built it--or the guy that sold it to me getting the
right answer to your question's.

I can't really think of the last time I tried analyze the interior of an
exhaust component looking into the inlet or outlet of it.

The directional arrow points that way---this is the way it gets hung.
