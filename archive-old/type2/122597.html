Subject: Re: [T2] Experience with aircooled_dot_net Oil Pressure Relief 
  Valve Resurfacing Tool

&gt; Hi Scott:
&gt; 
&gt; How much did your idle pressure improve (i.e. what was it before/after
&gt; and at what engine temperature)? Did you use the tool with the engine
&gt; assembled? Did it leave any shavings that were hard to clean out before
&gt; reassembly?

i did the procedure with the engine apart, during the rebuild process. idle
pressure improved perhaps 6-8 psi.

if the engine is together you can prevent debris from entering the galleries
by pressurizing the oil system with compressed air during machining. first
drain the oil, then attach an air hose to the oil sender port. the debris
will be blown out of the hole as it is being machined. i have never done it
this way, but i believe it is the accepted method.
