Question...

I've been searching the archives, but haven't found anything on this yet...

If the engine is set to TDC with the distributor out, can the distributor be
installed incorrectly?  Or is there only one way it can go at that point (my
hunch)?

And if the distributor is installed incorrectly, is it possible that the
engine could idle and run smoothly, but run very hot (provided timing,
dwell, etc. are ok, but set to the incorrect distributor alignment)?

Although I have a dual vacuum advance distributor, I liken this to Tom's 009
learning curve.. We are experiencing the flat spot..

Cheers,

Tom
