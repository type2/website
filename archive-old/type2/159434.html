Hey Ken,
Try cleaning it out w/ some brake cleaner.  That's what I did a while 
ago and that seemed to free it up nicely.  Maybe then spray some 
silicone spray or other lube in there and get it to soak into the axis 
where it rotates.  If you stick a screwdriver in there, you can actuate 
the flap and probably free it up.  Then you can adjust the little bolt 
for how much you want it to open up.  After you've cleaned it, stick it 
in the freezer to see if it closes all the way.

later,
Mike
