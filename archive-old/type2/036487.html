&gt; My opinion on the metal gaskets is that they will not make a perfect seal

&gt; the engine almost die from carb cleaner leaking past the gaskets.

This was my feeling, but I wanted some verification.  I used to spread a
thin layer of permatex on the metal gaskets, but the marks left on the
heads still led me to suspect that leakage was occuring.  I had some nice
thick paper gaskets handy the last time I put an engine in so I used them.
Perfect gasket surface aren't all that common.

The exhaust gaskets are indeed metal, but they also have a fiber layer
sandwiched between the metal layers.

For exhaust donuts, Ronnie supplied me with some 1-piece clamps with
donuts made from thin wire mesh.  They worked wonderfully compared to the
2-piece clamps and pseudo-asbestos donuts.
