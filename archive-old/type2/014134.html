Subject: Re: [T2] Mountain passes in NC

Been there two years ago in a brand new (to me) 78. 
Started shredding a 15 year old &quot;Made in West Germany&quot;
tire on the way down.  One of my more stupid moments. 
At least the jack worked.  Replaced it with an even
worse tire and lived to tell the story.

&gt; 2 weeks ago I conquered Old Fort Mountain on I-40 in
&gt; NC in my 81
&gt; vanagon............looked for a t-shirt stand at the
&gt; top and definitely felt
&gt; like some sort of gold star should now be worn on my
&gt; cap!  Took at at 45 MPH
&gt; in 3rd gear...........7 mile 6 % grade.............
&gt; 
&gt; I thought Saluda grade was bad on I-26 ( about a 3
&gt; mile 6 % grade) but Old
&gt; Fort puts it to shame!!!
