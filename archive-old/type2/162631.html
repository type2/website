others have given you good basic advice.

&gt; So, do I need to find a body that is made for the auto shifter or are
&gt; all of the bodies built the same?  Will my shifter fit into the same
&gt; place as the clutch?  If so, is it worth trying to find an auto body?
&gt; They seem pretty rare...

as to the Auto tranny, the bodies are indeed different and are not
interchangable without significant work including some welding of parts.

the auto tranny if good is worth a fair amount (I would make an offer if I
were closer to Texas)  also you would have to swap the flex plate for a
flywheel to use the engine in a manual and would also need to reset the
end play.

&gt; Should I strip off all of the good parts and trash the bus?  I really
&gt; believe that the engine and transmission are still good.  I never heard
&gt; any nasty sounds from the transmission...  All of the camper parts are

a good 010 auto tranny is worth a few bucks.

&gt; I want to stay with a camper...
&gt;
&gt; Whatever I end up doing, I only have 2000 to spend right now.  Am I
&gt; dreaming?

well selling some things like the auto tranny could increase the amount of
money you have.

auto tranny buses were 5-10% of buses sold in the USA
