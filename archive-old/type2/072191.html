Subject: jolly good list

all is improving. a few days ago i wacked the fuel pump against the
concrete, and it dribbled some gas and a lot of sediment. enough to choke a
cow. primed and wacked 4-5 times more and left the experience wondering why
in the name of sao paulo are the fuel pumps sealed units. fuel is
happening, so i guess i didn't destroy the diaphram.

on the other front, reverse has come alive. thanks to ZOLAN and HOWARD, and
the archives i changed out the shift rod coupler. normally a 5 minute job,
it took nearly a half hour with limited  tools and binding rust. but it was
so worth it, and if you have somewhat sloppy shifting, i very highly
recommend changing the coupler and feel the precision. in my case the
bushing wasn't too bad, b ut the cage was bent leaving me the impression
that the engine was once removed, and the tranny wasn't propped. hoping the
shift rod and hockey stick survived...

one remaining hurdle though, and that is a big bad battery drain. something
in the charging system is foul. overnight the battery dies. been through
the dash looking, but everything there seems perfect according to bentley's
wiring diagram. red gen light is on only while driving - at all revs.
question: what is the life span of a regulator? local repairman - not a
guru - suggested they go in about 10 years. i'm up in the air, and look to
your advise.  - steve
