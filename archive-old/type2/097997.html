Subject: Re: [T2] Reattaching the panel vinyl.

&gt; Since it is a 78, I only have one more year in California until the bus is
&gt; 25 years old, then I will not have to smog it again.

Bad news.  It's 30 years now.  Actually, they changed the year to 73, and
the rolling exemption will be 30 years starting in 2004, if they don't
change it again.
