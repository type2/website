&gt; Hi,
&gt; 	VW changed the calipers in '72- the later ones can use thicker pads,

&gt; The changeover date was August '72 ('73 Model year?).

&gt;  I *think* that you can use both the '77 calipers on a '72 axle.

Nope.  The spindle, caliper, and disk were a set.  You can either use all
'71-72 parts or all 73-up parts but not a combination of both.  I tried
it, and the dimensions are tantalizingly close, but it won't work.
Changing the pad thickness forced all the parts to change.
