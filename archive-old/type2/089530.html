Subject: Re: [T2] Sythetics, and air cooled engines

there's a lot more to oil then pressure.

The VW's oiling system is based on pressure, NOT TEMPERATURE. if you run a
too-heavy oil in there, pressure will be fantastic, but the engine will
&quot;think&quot; the oil is too cold and will bypass the oil cooler. Guess what
happens to your oil temps?

You are best off sticking to a multigrade oil, and as long as idle pressure
is between 5-10psi, you are fine. This will result in the coolest running
oil and best lubricated engine. After all, if you run 0 clearance on your
bearings, the oil pressure will be incredible, until the journal burns from
overheating (oil removes the heat too, it's not just a lubricant).

Most  (not all) VW owners are ignorant about the way the VW engine TRULY
operates, and if someone tells you to run straight weights, they better have
a real good reason. The FACTORY recommends multigrades on the newest
aircooleds (why?). I think it's crazy to run a synthetic that's a straight
weight. i can understand for a compressor or another low RPM device, but an
automotive engine?????? run a 5 or 10-50 and enjoy it.
