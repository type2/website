Subject: '69 engine into a '67 splity - advice sought

I just picked up a complete '69 engine that I would like to prepare for a 
'67.  I want a running engine, turnkey installation.

1-  Advice sought - is this a good or reasonable decision??

2-  The bearer bar on the '69  is basically worthless.  Do I need the bearer 
bar from a '67 - what else would fit, like bug bearer bars??

3-  The heat exchangers look pretty bad, and the muffler is totally rusted.  
Does anyone in the Washington DC area + 100 miles have a used and good setup 
they would like to let go?? [[ I have an excellent/primo stove top cover 
from a '79 Westy I could trade.]]

4-  On heat exchangers, is the&quot;Made by JP Group of Denmark.&quot; a good or 
indifferent product.

5-  On new, does anyone have any recommendations from the mufflers sold by 
Bus Depot??  I am confused.  This is the first upright engine I have seen up 
close.

Lots more questions coming, I am sure.

PS. I have a bell housing for the '69 engine. I left the trans and took the 
engine and bell housing.   left the starter, too..
