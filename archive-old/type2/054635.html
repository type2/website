Subject: Oil Cooler removal

Volks:

The oil cooler  on my 71 Westy is leaking. I ordered some from Rocky Mountain 
and plan to replace the old ones this weekend. My question is: Is this 
something that can be done without pulling the engine? I checked the archives 
but didn't find an answer to my question. Thanks in advance for your help
