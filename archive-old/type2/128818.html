Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

&gt; very few changes on the trannys, the 010 tranny has the shift linkage on
&gt; the other side, and the detents are Inside the tranny rather than on the
&gt; shift linkage, and there is no vacuum lines or adjustments.
&gt;
Basically I am just wondering about the servicing - it's unclear as to
whether there is a replacable filter screen, or a cleanable one. It's an
early '77 (made 11/76) I don't want to have to take it apart before going
to the FLAPS if possible. Want to get the correct gasket as well, and also
I didn't see a fill plug for the gearbox.
thanks,
