Subject: Re: [T2] stuck 2 liter

Sounds like a burned rod bearing, or piston seizure, see if the oil smells
burned.....

If the engine has been sitting for a long period of time, or if it has been
around alot of moisture, it may have rusty cylinders..

&gt; Okay, I'm lazy, I'll admit it. The 2L 77 I bought has a stuck motor. Can
&gt; turn the engine over a quarter turn in each direction before it sticks
&gt; solid. Now if it were a 1600, I'd suspect a broken flywheel or something
&gt; lodged in the dist gear, but this was a running type 4 before this
happened
&gt; and the engine appears too clean to have suffered lack of maintenance. As
&gt; this is my first type 4 I'm looking for the most common things or things
&gt; peculiar to type 4's, dropped valves,jammed flywheels, etc
&gt; thanks all
