Subject: Re: [T2] Type IV fan came loose.

Thanks for this info.  I agree that I am lucky.

The three 12-point bolts did not come loose, it was the 13 mm bolt that
bolts the hub to the crank shaft.  I assume that this is positioned using
the woodruff key, which I am sure is missing, lost, or is somehow otherwise
out of position, which means that the crankshaft can spin, but not the fan
(bad) and/or the key can find itself in a position to damage other
components (also bad).  I am taking this all apart to fix it.  The 13 mm
bolt seemed to just come loose.  The thread were fine, it tightened back OK.
I think that that fan may be a bit dinged up, but it spins.  I should
replace it.

The bus engine does seem fine.  Plenty of power, runs and sounds great.  I
had just changed the oil and it is still amber.  After driving some 20 miles
at 40-60 mph.  I pulled off and the engine seemed quite cool.  The dipstick
was barely warm, all cooling tin was touchable.

&gt;&gt; where it blonged, by feel.  I just twisted it until it seemed secure and
&gt;&gt; rebolted into position.  The engine started and ran fine.  I was almost
&gt;&gt; tempted to go to the beach anyway, but I opted for the pool instead.  It
&gt;&gt; seems to be running fine, thank goodness.  But how do I reposition this
&gt; fan?
&gt;&gt; Are there other issues that are being overlooked by me.  I was very glad
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; be able to fix it and continue on.  It is running very nice and cool.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You are very lucky you didn't destroy the engine.  But now you have found
&gt; out that even with a Type 4 engine you still have to stop immediately and
&gt; check when the gen light comes on, as several people on this list have had
&gt; the fan bolts shear or the fan otherwise come loose as you experienced.
&gt; 
&gt; The fan doesn't have to be in any particular position for engine operation,
&gt; but for timing it is important.  The fan should only seat fully one way.
&gt; Behind the fan there is a fan hub which should have a little pin sticking
&gt; out of it which seats in a hole on the back of the fan (or the fan has the
&gt; pin and the hub has the hole, I can't remember).  Once you get that seated
&gt; you're good to go.  If this pin has sheared off (seems likely if the fan
&gt; loosened up) then it's anyone's guess.  You would have to find TDC manually
&gt; (by removing spark plug for #1 and inserting a dowel to identify when the
&gt; piston reaches TDC) and then you could reattach the fan based on that.
