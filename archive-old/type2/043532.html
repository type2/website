Subject: (f) What do you call a group of VW's?

Volks,

Last week I asked for suggestions of what to call a group of VW's.  Below
are the responses I recieved (with footnotes! :-)  Thank you, one and all
for the suggestions!

(1) (hey, it works for rhinoceri) -- Nikki Elko

(2) I call a group of busses a &quot;boggle&quot; for some reason.
    There is always some one in the group that totally boggles my mind, or
    I boggle theirs. -- Charlie Ford

(3) How about a Jerry of VW's?  Allusions to both the country of origin
    and the stereotype of the deadhead owner. -- Alistair Collum

(4) Seeing as this list is so acronym  prone I say we call a group of
    busses a GOB (group of busses).  A group of VW enthusiasts we could
    call a LOVE (Lots of volkswagen enthusiasts).  And a group of VWs in
    general will be a BOGOV (Big Ole Group Of Volkswagens OR Bunch Of Good
    Old Volkswagens) or, in the case of my front yard, a GOVNR (Group of
    Volkswagens Needing Repair) of Vws -- Jed Thompson
