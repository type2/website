Subject: Double Relay Lessons Learned


Lessons I learned from Billy's tussle with the fuel pump problem on his 79 
Bus.

Lesson 1

In the 79 Bus, unlike earlier FI buses, the double relay solenoid ground 
return (pin 85) passes through the ECU and then to the hidden engine ground 
under the air manifold.

(This means the relay will not pull in and the fuel pump will not run ( even 
in start mode) if the ECU connector is disconnected on a 79 Bus. This is not 
true of 75 through 78 buses as pin 85 is more directly grounded on these 
models.)


Lesson 2

A poor ground return to the double relay, on any model, can cause this relay 
to chatter and chop the 12 volts power to the pump relay. Since the pump 
only runs in bursts, the fuel pressure falls.

If you measure the the pump input voltage (during the chopping) with a DC 
voltage meter the meter reading will be a function of the chop frequency and 
the type of meter used (digital or analog).  The meter could tend to average 
the voltage bursts and be lower than 12 volts or try to jump between zero 
and 12 Volts and all in between. A oscilloscope would be the best instrument 
to view the chopped waveform but just feeling the relay vibrating should be 
the trouble shooting tip-off.
