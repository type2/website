Subject: Questions about buying a 71 bus/camper

I am looking at buying a 71 type2 bus, its got 20k on a rebuilt, new
brakes,clutch, rebuilt generator, repacked CV joints, and 2 year old
windshield/seal.  Only two problems:

1-Small oil leak, he was unable to detect where it was when he rebuilt
the engine. He claims its either in the front seal or the seals in the
oil cooler.

2-Rust: Small amounts of surface rust but the worst is in the floor, i
hear this is common.  He recommends that I grind it out and weld a new
floor board in.

The price is 1100 bucks. 
My big questions are whether or not the two repairs, the oil leak and
rust, are going to be very expensive and necessary repairs or what?
Any help you could dish out to this exteremly inexpierenced bus lover
would be greatly appreciated....
