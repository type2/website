Harry,

The primary source of air for your cabin heat is from the cooling
(crankshaft) fan. The electric fan is only engaged when the heater
settings are set to high and even at that, it doesn't build up enough
pressure to blow the dead bugs out of your defroster. There should be
two sets of one-way flapper doors; plastic ones in the auxiliary
(electric) fan and aluminum ones on the fan shroud where the heater
boxes hook up to it.

When the electric fan is providing most of the heating air, its plastic
flappers will open and its air pressure will force the aluminum flappers
closed, which redirects the air up front instead of out the fan shroud.
At higher RPMs or when the electric fan is off, the cooling fan blows
the aluminum flappers open and the plastic flappers closed to keep the
heating air moving forward instead of out the electric fan's intake.

This raises another consideration in my pea-brain: If you are missing
the heater control boxes and/or the tubes going up to the electric fan,
I'm wondering if this would reduce the volume of air and air pressure
available to cool the engine. :?(

On duct tape... wonderful stuff, is it possible all those busses are in
the junk yard because of the duct tape? :) Seriously, though, I think
there's a lot of heat on most of the heat exchanger that would cause the
duct tape to fail in short order. I would only use duct tape as a
temporary measure, not a permanent fix.

I just reworked this system on the 1800 that's about ready to go back
into the '73 (YIPEE!). Driving kids to the ski resorts in Utah, I want
good heat (VW stds!). One of the aluminum doors on the fan shroud was
damaged &amp; repaired beyond usability, so I fashioned a replacement from
aluminum flashing material (available at home improvement stores). The
flashing material is thicker than a beer can, which the PO tried to use,
so it's easier to get it to lay flat. I paid careful attention to the
original shape, especially the bottom corners and top tabs that form the
hinge. It needs to move freely without binding inside the heat
exchanger. And I stretched it into the fan shroud opening, a little like
the original, to help it lay flat.

There are also nifty little caps that go on the top of the heat
exchanger/fan shroud junction. The gaskets on these were a little
chewed, so I bought some weather strip that looked like it would hold up
to the heat and replaced the gaskets (anyone know if those gaskets are 
available?). You could make some out of thick, pseudo-asbestos gasket
mat'l.

Also, my original fan had the plastic flappers missing so I've replaced
it with a junkyard unit.

Sorry for the long post, hope this is useful.

&gt; Paul,
&gt; In reading this, you touched on a question I have been trying to figure
&gt; out.  The back of the heater box connects to the bottom of the cooling fan,
&gt; Why?  Also, from reading another email, there used to be one way doors
&gt; (that I do not have nor are they available) that would let air out but not
&gt; in, how would air travel the opposite direction if the cooling fan is
&gt; constantly blowing air out?  Last, in junk yards, a popular fix seems to be
&gt; putting duct tape around this area, does this help anything? (looked pretty
&gt; rigged, there must be a better way)
