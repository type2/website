Subject: pics! was: great speaker location...

Hola,

http://www.sfbaywindows_dot_com//speakerpics/

I did mount speakers under the dash, actually just before this project,
but that didn't sound good either. 

I'm pretty picky I guess. 

As I put my bus back together before the bus campout (see site listed
above), I'll try and post pics of the dual battery setup and dual
subwoofer/amp power supply whatchamacallit....

Best,
Christopher

I have also kicked around the idea of trying to mount two small speakers

under the dash, but not in the front kick plates.  Space is limited....
