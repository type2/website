Subject: Re: [T2] CA DMV Requirments

You were lucky!

&quot;The AAA person told me that I could continue to operate the vehicle 
until  it
passed smog and that if it took longer than the time allowed they would 
give
me as many extensions as was necessary.&quot;

Ayup.  In the meantime, if your vehicle had a smog problem, you could 
easily have spent thousands and many hours and some hair attempting to 
get it to pass.  And back to the story that started this discussion. 
That's why I want to see it before I buy, and hope it's not just from 
his buddy at the gas station.  ;-)  If it'll pass smog, it's gotta be in 
fairly good condition, right?

Trust.  I am saddened every day by how eager folks are to totally rip 
each other off.  One of the worst was getting royally screwed over a 
deal I did with a (former to T2) listmember.  Ultimately cost me about 
$2500 because I figured I could trust a T2 oldtimer.

On the other hand, you've got a few folks like Karl, who I have to 
badger to send money for things already on my doorstep.

Oops, it's not friday.  I'll quit sniveling now.
