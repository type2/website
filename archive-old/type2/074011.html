&gt; &gt; How do you remove the taillight housings on a 72?
&gt;
&gt; I probably shouldn't oughta be answering this, as I have never owned a '72
&gt; and these days, I make it a rule not to answer questions on buses I have
&gt; nto personnally owned, but....
&gt;
&gt; &quot;72 is a transition year, I am not sure which taillight system it has (and
&gt; for all I know, it changes in mid-year) but here is the way to remove
&gt; either...
&gt;
&gt; '68-71 have the oval lights and to remove them, you remove the two screws
&gt; holding the lens on then gently push the gasket thru to pop the bucket
&gt; into the body, then unplug it and remove the fixture from the inside.
&gt; OK, maybe you could pop it *out* instead, but that's how I've always done
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; '73-79 have the rectangular lights and the bucket is fastened with 4
&gt; skinny studs and (?) M6 nuts (?) that you can not see, but can only feel
&gt; on the inside (about 1&quot; down and up from the corners on either side).
&gt; Get a 6mm deep socket on a nut driver and they will come off, then the
&gt; bucket comes out to the outside.  Oh... take the lens off first :-)
