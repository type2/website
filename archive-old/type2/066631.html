&gt; Here is what I have been considering, and would like
&gt; opinions on it. At SAMS, they sell a 5200 btu 1500 watt
&gt; ceramic heater for about $25. It pulls ~15 amps.

Um thats 15 amps at 120V AC, not quite the same, to
run your 1500 watt heater you would need a 1500 watt
inverter and a quick look at the prices of such things
and their current draw will show the error in your ways.

Unfortunately as I've said, electricity is not a valid
options, ie

Power = Voltage * Current

so the max a homely little 50 amp alternator can put out at say
even 14 VDC (common for charging system) is about a whoppin
700 Watts which actually might not be too bad, but that would
be if you used the entire output for heat IE NO LIGHTS, NO
CHARGING, HECK NO IGNITION AFTER A TIME.  Electricity is
not your best energy value here.  Think

1. Gas Heater (if available)
2. Layered Clothing
3. Recirculation through your existing system.

The problem with air cooled cars is that they suck the air
continuously to be heated from the outside, so even if your
boxes are giving you a 30-40 degree rise in temp, on a 10
degree day all you get is 40-50 degree air.  On late buses
and vanagons an easy way to help the system is to cut a
bitty hole in the body back on the side above the engine
compartment (watch them fuel vent lines Bus owners) for a piece
of 3&quot; or so hose and plumb this to the intake of the stock electric
or alternator mounted squirrel cage fan.  Now you are sucking
air back out of the Bus and reheating it so air temp rises
progressively.  Now for those worried about O2 depletion on
Buses DON'T, the electric fan supplies less than 50% of your
air at full tilt anyway, most of it coming from the engine
cooling fan.  On vans I still wouldn't worry but haven't tried
it on vans yet.  
Make sure your stock system is in tip top shape too, the Y
pipe and center distribution boxes rust worse than the heater
boxes as do the flapper controls.  And the cables to the flappers
stretch and allow heated air to be wasted, adjust the cables if
you still can or wire the flappers full open for winter.
And permanently seal the cold air intakes up front for winter,
as in TAPE THEM OFF or something similar, closing them is seldom
enough on Buses with aged seals.
The recirculation system can really improve the system, drove the
'78 all last winter with such in place and experienced a better
than 20F improvement after the mods.  With a partition it should
be quite comfortable up front.
