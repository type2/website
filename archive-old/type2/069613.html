Subject: The best junkyard ever(was: Seattle shops, a few questions, too.)

I just posted about a shop I like, University Foreign Car. near the UW.

As far as junk yards go, you can't beat Bry's.  When you walk in, they
have tools out for customers to pick up and bring out into the yard.  I
could spend hours there.  Just grab a wrench and go to town.  When you
bring in your loot, they look at it and pretty much as what you think it's
worth.  They are in West Seattle.

I went there a couple days ago looking for an alternator bracket.  They
told me where to look (&quot;just don't take one off a good motor&quot;) and handed
me the appropriate sized socket.  Yippee!
