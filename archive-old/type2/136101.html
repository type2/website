Subject: an extra hose.

I'm trouble shooting my running, but beyond reparable cancer ridden,
76's engine. It starts pretty easily, to include at 35 degrees this
morning, idles well, and will go in first with no problems. As soon as I
shift or allow the rpms to drop, the engine dies. 

A compression check is on my list for today, but I noted a hose which is 
not connected on one end. It is about a half inch hose which attaches to 
a disc on the side of the aircleaner. There is also a small vacuum hose 
which goes from the center of this disc to the decel valve. Is this disc 
my Fuel Pressure Regulator? Does anyone know where the loose end of the 
larger hose should terminate?

I've got both of the vacuum diagrams from Richard's site.  The layout 
does not currently match up (surprise!) with either diagram.

Thanks much for any advice in advance,

jack
