All the solid black face bus clocks are quartz. From about 73 up. The early
bays gauges with the center silver disc, 68 to about early 73, had a matching
analog clock.

&gt; &gt; Analog or quartz?  I can run either one and get you a figure. The analog
has a
&gt; &gt; capaciter run winder, so it draws a bunch, winds, stops drawing, winds
down,
&gt; &gt; draws again, winds, etc. The quartz is a constant draw.
&gt;
&gt; analog,   didn't know the bay had a quartz

&gt; &gt; &gt; just out of curiosity do you know how much the VW dash clock draws??
