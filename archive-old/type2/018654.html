I saw a couple of posts this week that I meant to respond to, but I'm a
little behind at work and never got around to
it.  Here goes:

Stewart - Warner Southwind heaters
    I have a couple of these things, and yes, the fuel pump diaphrams
(valves) get hard after sitting without gas in them
for a while.  Sometimes just letting the plate soak in a tin of gas will
bring them back, sometimes not.  $65 seems
awful high; they put these in the cabs of semi trucks, so that's where I
go for spare parts.  The local truck stop on
I-94 sells the fuel pump diaphrams for about $14 last time I bought one.

Engine stand
  I bought the cheap $20 bench style engine stand from Ron at Bus Depot
and it fit my 2.0L type 4 engine.  I put a
new stub on it to fit my rollaround and it worked great.  The fit and
finish isn't exactly Snapon, but for $20 it saved a
bunch of welding and bending.

AVP
    I ordered an AVP engine through Ron also, and I have had a very
positive experience so far.  The phone support
has been great, the engine is very nicely detailed, and it seems to run
well so far.  They went above and beyond on
little things like replacing all of the oil galley plugs with tapped
plugs.  It doesn't leak (they told me it wouldn't).  They
gave me a new fan coupler so I wouldn't have to buy a puller to remove
the old one from the core.  It has a 12,000
mile/12 month warranty.  Did I mention the phone support?
I have 600 miles on the breakin so far and it purrs nicely.
