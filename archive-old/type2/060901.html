Subject: RE: Type I in a late model bus?

&gt;was written:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;There are a lot of reasons not to change to the type 1 engine. In my
&gt;&gt; opinion a type 1 engine in a loaf used in the US under normal
&gt;&gt; circumstances is only good for 100,000 km (61k miles). A good stock
&gt;&gt; 17-18-2000cc type 4 engine should last close to twice that. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would argue that a change to a type one is ok for saving money!
&gt;A lot more bugs have been on the road, and the parts are cheap. A
&gt;well built 1600 will not cost as much to repair or change.
&gt;And I think 61,000 miles is a very low number. I have two friends who
&gt;have clocked 200,000 miles on their Type 1's in busses. At that point
&gt;they needed rebuilding, but they lasted that long. I usually will
&gt;be conservative and give the type 1 about 100,000 in a bus. I've done
&gt;it. By the way, one of the busses is a 74 with european conversion. Why
&gt;did he do it? Cheap, cheap, cheap. New heads, new case, whatever, it is
&gt;much cheaper than a type IV.
&gt;
&gt;On another note...I purchased a 70 westy a year ago. Decided to pull 
&gt;engine to replace the main seal. Good idea, but of course that led to 
&gt;replacing all seals, the pushrod tubes, converting to a doghouse, 
&gt;installing
&gt;electronic ignition and temp sensor, and now I am thinking about new 
&gt;rings!
&gt;Once they are out you just can't stop! By the way, to tie this to the 
&gt;above
&gt;message, removal took all of about 15 minutes, a seal kit is about $10,
&gt;new pushrod tubes about $12. Installation back into the bus will take 
&gt;about half an hour at most. Now could this be why I like the 1600 Type 
&gt;I?

Well,
  I have to add my $0.02 here. I have a 70 Bus with the upright and 
would not concider changing for anything, I love it. They say they don't 
last as long, but I would rather buy 2 type 1's  than 1 type 4. Even if 
they last half as long they also cost less than half as much. So your 
still money ahead. And your custom speed stuff is cheaper and more 
available. If we could just get the engine tin for a late model 
convertions imported at a decent pricee we would be in good shape. I'm 
sure that the type 4's are very good motors but I would never try to 
talk someone out of an upright. I pulled 2 tranaxles and removed and 
replaced my engine after swaping transaxles in less than 3 hours. tyr 
that on a type 4 Bus.
But what ever you decide it will be great because its a VW!
