Subject: rear disk brakes and emergency brakes

There have been well documented cases over here in England of cars fitted
with disk brakes all round rolling away with the emergency/hand brake on!

This is due to the disk getting hot and expanding under braking then 'self 
releasing' the brake due to the disk cooling and contracting. When a drum 
contracts it will cause the brake to be applied harder.

Some cars have separate drum brakes for the hand brake which would seem to be 
the way to go if possible. 
Otherwise pull the hand brake on hard and don't park on hills:-)
