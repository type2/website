Subject: disposable CO detector

Hi all
Tonight when I was at my local Wal-Mart drooling over all the power tools
I came upon a small disposable CO detector. The detector was on a little
card and was supposed to last about 3 months. The cost was ~$4 ea.
I some people have seen similar ones in aircraft supply houses,
but there is not exactly one of those on every corner. :)

So if you really want one of these and can't find it, drop me a line
and I'll pick one up for you.

For those of you who remember the exaust in cab thread, I found
my exaust leak. After fixing it I ran the bus w/heater on and put
my house CO detector on the dash. After 10 min, no alarm. :)

I got a great deal tonight. I have been looking for a bench vise for
about a month. Hoping to find one used I have been holding off.
Well I went into the local SEARS, which is mostly just a catalog
store, and they had one 4 1/2 &quot;  vise for $14.99. I was stoked!!
So I took it to the counter to pay and it turns out the computer
has it listed at 11.99!!!!:) It was a good night....
