Went to heavy, in the way bypass pipes that lets the air from the heater
box exit to the outside rear.  The theory is that it diverts the hot air
away from the heads- but I removed them as being in the way for valve
adjustments- and the replacement flapper boxes simple exit the air from
the box anyway.  I did try to block the outlet for the air once on the
assumption that it allowed more air to the engine cooling, but then the
oil sitting on the heater box will smoke- so Deutscher mechaniker
realised you gotta keep the boxes cool enough!  You can put flexible
pipe (the stuff earlier busses use to send air from upright fan housing)
ojn the connector and tape/wire it to the rear. MB 78 Westy

&gt; Quick question:
&gt; One outlet port from the heater box goes to the hot air intake for the cab.....Where is the other one supposed to exit?  On mine, there is nothing...but it appears as if the flange was made to attach to something....What gives
&gt; Thanks in advance
