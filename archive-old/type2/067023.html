Subject: Bus Points

Does anyone have problems with their points in a type IV motor. 
I am changing points about ever couple months now and wonder if this is
normal. I just moved about four months ago and now live in a very hilly
area of town that has a lot of stop and go traffic. Could this be the
problem. I used to live out in the country were it is flat and nonstop
roads except that stop sign that I missed. 
I don't think this is the problem though. I thought that maybe it was not
timed right, took it to a good mechanic and had it timed and the points
adjusted. But it is still going through those points. Since summer I have
replaced them at least three times.
Thanks
