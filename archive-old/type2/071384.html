Subject: Re: [T2] Coating a Exhaust Manifold
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

A lot of the rust in an exhaust system starts from the inside out. Wait
for a damp day and watch the exhaust pipe at start up...Lots of conden-
sation being blown out until the system gets hot enough to burn off the
water. It's this internal rusting that wipes out the system. 
The ceramic coatings prevent this rusting, but at a price...Another list
I'm on reports that the inside and outside ceramic coating retained enough
heat to destroy cast headers in a year...YMMV, of course.
