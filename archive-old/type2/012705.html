Subject: gas pump on a 74

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Well a while ago I determined that my gas pump was kaput as
it was dripping from the vent tube. So off I go to the yard
and get a new/used one. Came home pulled the old one, got a
gas shower.. was fun! put the new one in along with all new
hoses. Now when you replace the hose from the tank to the
pump you have to use an in line filter as the outlet for
the tank and the inlet to the pump are different sizes. The
in line filter effectivly acts as a splice for the two size
hoses... I was unable to find the hose originally intended
for this purpose so this was the route I had to go.
  Wellllll the new/used pump didnt work so I had to pull it
and go back to the yard and get another one.... this time I
checked the operation of the pump before leaving (duh)... I
pulled the first one apart to see if maybe there was some
crud in it or something and it seems as though someone had
gutted it to rebuild another pump? who knows! Anyhew I now
am pretty quick at changing fool er fuel pumps on a 74. As
a matter of fact I enjoyed it sooo much I would only charge
$500.00 to do it for someone else!;-)
Lessons learned:
The fuel line from the tank to the pump is a different size
at each end.
Check out the operation of a recycled pump BEFORE
installing it.
Run as much gas out of the tank before messing around with
this system... if you can that is.
This is the best time to replace all your fuel lines!
