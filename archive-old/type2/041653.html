Subject: Re: Exhaust mounting question

[...]


&gt; Simple question:
&gt; After reassembling exhaust and getting ready to start Frances ('76 T4), it
&gt; seems odd that there isn't a hanger of some kind to support the left rear
&gt; section of exhaust.  With my current assembly, all the weight of that side
&gt; of the exhaust is being supported by where the heater box clamps to the
fan
&gt; housing.  What am I missing?  Is there something that bolts to the fan
&gt; housing to support the elbow or what?  I can't find any pictures that show
&gt; this area to know what I am missing.

There is a support. It is about 1/2&quot; wide and 4&quot; long. It goes from the
upper bolt where the crossover pipe connects to the U pipe that goes to the
converter and muffler. The other end gets bolted to the end of the fan
housing. You should see an empty 8mm stud. It has a slight S shape and the
holes are 3 1/2&quot; center-to-center. The Bentley does not show the bracket in
the exhaust picture in section 5 page 15. They should have put it with the
bolt they picture on the left end of the tranverse pipe. But on page 21,
they show the stud!  It is between the lines for 23 + 24.

If you can't find or make the bracket....give me a holler, I have one.
