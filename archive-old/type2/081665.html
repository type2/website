Subject: '78 Deluxe Westy-$16000- Worth it?

------=_NextPart_000_0090_01C1E636.1C0C11A0

I have a buddy who has located a '78 Deluxe Westy, Dakota Beige, 14500 =
miles, all original, no wear whatsoever, and is contemplating buying it. =
 I have seen this vehicle and it is in almost showroom condition.  =
However, the price is $16000 firm.  The camper has been kept in a =
climate controlled garage and I have no doubt this is one of the nicest =
campers in the US.

I feel $16000 is a really high price for something like this, even =
considering the condition.  What is the consensus on something like =
this?  Is he nuts to pay that much for it? He is really thinking about =
forking over the cash for it, but I'm wondering if buying something in =
lesser condition for $10000 less wouldn't be a better investment.

Brad
