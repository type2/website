Lack of pulse could be symptomatic of incorrect j-o-b or the wires were 
crossed and when you answered your calling it was actually meant for someone 
else.  ;)

So, it *probably* (I'm guessing asterisks serve to italicize?) is your 
exchangers baking around 20 mo. worth of stuff out (make sure there's no 
oil, in addition).  Unhook the connecting ducts if you're in no hurry.

Yes, this bus sat for the last 18 months...inside a shop. It was freshly 
painted about 20 months ago. I am in Southern California, so a heater is not 
a necessity for the winter. Yes, and I already checked and there is no pulse 
:-)
