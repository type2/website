Subject: RE: [T2] pulley/spacer behind fan/and more

Okay Dave I'll be over to your house later this summer so you can explain where all these pieces go - I've got a '78 Westy with a factory air system I bought from a friend in NC... Complete, but apart. 

Oh never mind I forgot - we are looking at houses with second bathrooms and garages so I maybe busy and poor...

Saw an interesting Corvair Greenbrier van a fellow had installed a rear a/c system in. Has a stock system up front and then in back he has spliced into the refridgerant lines a temp control solenoid that controls refridgerant flow into a second blower, and a second set of coils all added into a unit he built into the wall on one side. Has independent fan control and temp control for the rear, 1 compressor, etc. Got pics or you can join &quot;AirVairs&quot;, a Yahoo group.
