&gt;All it does is convert 120V AC to 12V DC to run the fridge and charge the aux battery when you connect to a
&gt;land line. The 120V outlets only are hot when you connect to a land line. It does NOT invert 12V DC up to 120V
&gt;AC.

Speaking of inverters, when I was at BYOB a couple of weeks ago, Gabriel Garcia was cutting keys using power from a Honda generator:
