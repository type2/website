&gt; Straw example again: cap end of straw with finger either completely or
halfway. You are the fan, your finger represents the restrictions in the
heater system (bends, flappers, etc.). Suck on straw. Notice that you die...

[lol]

I haven't seen a bilge blower yet (will after I get &quot;G&quot; back on the road),
but it it's the size that I expect, I'll be installing it in the tire well.
I plan on designing a bracket that will cradle the blower in RTV silicone
bushings (sound-proofing), with a split adapter on the end facing the rear
of the bus to route the output into the engine compartment and divide the
output to the two hoses, and an adapter on the intake end that will allow
the intake to be routed up out of the tire well (will probably add a
cleanable filter to the intake).

The tentative design includes being able to remove the blower by simply
removing a plate at one end and lifting the blower up out of the cradle.
The tire well will be lined with sound insulation and (if the blower
installation leaves room), a sound-insulated lid will be added to complete
the setup.  Hmm... let's call it the &quot;Blow 'ard&quot; (TM!).

Ideally, I'll be able to reproduce the cradle and adapters in resin, and
then be able to retail them; but I'm tied up with current projects and with
the weather changing (sunny Georgia), I might be working on it as time
permits through the summer.
