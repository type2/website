Subject: Re: [T2] Another Vacuum Can question:

&gt; have a can #113 905 271 F with 851 stamped on the arm.  Anyone know what
this is from?  Does it have the same advance/retard range as an 853?

Are you sure about these numbers?

851 does not appear on any lists I have, I have always wondered about it.. I
found one of these on a 113 905 205AJ distributor. The AJ fits a 71 bug manual
trans and it should have a 07 223 vacuum unit on it. I cannot find a cross
reference to this 07 223. If it is a 851, then no, it has too much vac
advance:
Advance/Retard Range: Vacuum: 9-12deg Adv, 11-13deg Ret

I am not sure about your 113 905 271 F number. If this came from the body of
the dizzy, it should be 205 not 271. But the F does not appear.....
