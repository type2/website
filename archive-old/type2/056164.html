&gt; but haven't heard or seen anything about VW powered two-wheel
&gt; transportation since.  Do any of you listees out there have your spare
&gt; bus engine sitting between two wheels?

Don't have one, but I have seen one or two BMW bikes converted to VW 
motors. After all, the BMW &quot;boxer&quot; is half a flat four. How about  going 
the other way: two boxers, one engine and tranny 
for each rear wheel on a bus?  Hmmmm....
