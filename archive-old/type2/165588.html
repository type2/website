&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; Is there an easy to fix leaky push tubes without dropping  engine and
&gt; removing the head?

&gt; It is a 69 with the original type 1 engine.

I managed to stop a pushrod tube leak once by just turning the tube. It was on 
a new rebuild and the o-ring must not have seated correctly...
