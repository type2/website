Subject: RE: [T2] vdo oil pressure gauge/sender

Oil pressure senders vary resistance.  That is why the gauge needs it's own
12V power source, to measure the resistance.

I went to the trouble of trimming the tin to install the VDO pressure
sensor.  It looks nice, but I was only able to trim enough so the tin could
fit on over the sender. I can't unscrew the sender without removing the tin
first. If it fails or leaks, It will be a major PITA to replace.  Also it's
in the way of the dizzy. Next time I think I'll use the extension and plug
up the hole in the tin. YMMV

Can someone verify for me that this sender is the type that the
resistance changes with oil pressure change?...not like the CHT stuff
that requires special extension wire?
