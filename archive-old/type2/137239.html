Hi Anyone,

I just bought a vanagon 1983 camper which need engine (rebuild/replacement)
I spent hours over internet trying to obtain info about it and the more 
I read , the more I get confused. :-(

I am basicaly looking for a good shop to buy a rebuild aircool 2000 cc 
engine.
I would like to buy a rebuilded one or get a kit to rebuild it myself.  
I can buy over internet , but I would appreciate a nice vendor around 
San francisco I can talk with and ask advises.

I would be glad to have any kind of info

Thank you very much.

Chris
