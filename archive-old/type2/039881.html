Subject: Re: definition?

I know it's trivial, but I'm curious. After all these years, I've got
two different styles of fasteners holding my tin on -- phillips and
slotted. Which is which? I've heard the term &quot;cheesehead tin screws&quot; --
which style does that apply to? Is it the same as the fillister, or the
other one?

Inquiring minds want to know.

&gt; &gt; Browsing my Bentley, soaking up knowledge, and I run across this term:
&gt; &gt; What *is* a fillister head screw? &lt;baffled look&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Easiest definition = it is the style of the head, should be the same as the
&gt; heads of the screws holding the engine tin on.
