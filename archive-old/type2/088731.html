   Hi Listees

  I have been monitoring fuel consumption on my bus for 4 years and was =
pleasantly surprised to see the mileage has risen from 18-20mpg to 22 to =
24.5mpg ever since
the top end rebuild on my engine this spring.(1700cc dual Solex). I =
drive a 40/60
ratio between city and highway so it's not just freeway driving. When I =
rebuilt the carbs I found the original main jets to be 127.5 as per =
Bentley.
The engine doesn't run hot.(205F during 90+ weather last week)
Should I run 130s or larger to help keep the heads cool? The last set of =
rebuilt heads lasted 25K miles and I don't want to replace these in that =
short of time.

Thanks
