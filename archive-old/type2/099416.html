&gt;
&gt;This brings up a question I've been meaning to ask fro some time.  Does
&gt;anyone have a solid info, or informed opinions on what the effect of
&gt;removing the dividers behind the front seats would have on the integrity
&gt;of the van?

  Bob,
  The busses of '78 &amp; '79 came that way.The dividers of earlier busses were
  done away with and a triangular gusset plate was welded into the corner
  instead.
  The gusset plate from memory was approx 150mm (6') long on the
  hypotenuse.As long as a suitable plate is welded back in,in lieu of the
  dividers it is OK to change this arrangement.I evenly vaguely recall a VW
  statement to this end many moons ago....

  A friend of mine once cut the dividers out of a '74 VW but never welded in
  the plates to compensate.Some time later he hit a loaded dump truck
  partially head-on on a narrow dirt road.He survived with relatively minor
  injuries but the force of the impact sprung the driver's door open and he
  was thrown from the van.
  Naturally the van was a write-off and would have been regardless of
  whether the dividers were there or not but if the VW body's integrity had not
  been tampered with,(and not compensated for) I can't help wondering if
  the door would have sprung and chucked him out...
