Subject: Re: [VB] [T2]Hemp, Hippies, and back to the seat covers

I agree Thom, hemp is not nearly as cool or trendy as painting an old work
van bright yellow, starting a _dot_com , throwing on some european headlights
and a roof rack (that will never be used) and driving down to the beach to
play volleyball and surf,

Does anyone know what the cutoff date is for being a hippie? I think 79
would be the cutoff for vw people , or is that you had to be a liscensed
driver before 79?

But back to the bus content as this is a bus list and not a come down tent
for some yuppie having a bad trip,  The point of having the seat covers is
that you can slip them on and off and throw them in the washer. It protects
your new vinyl and covers old.
The ones i have right now are hemp cotton denim for walkthrough 64-67 front
seats, but they could be made from any fabric that you can throw in the
washing machine.  The hemp cotton denim i have is a very nice fabric and can
be dyed any color, or tie dyed. It is very durable and it is 55%hemp.
I can make them from any fabric you choose. You can  pick the fabric and
send me 5 yards and i will send you nice tight slip on seatcovers. Several
people on the list have them and love them.  the pic is at
www.kinddeals_dot_com/hempcovers.jpg . pmail me for details.

&gt; The only &quot;advantage&quot; of hemp seat covers is the bragging rights to tell
all your pictuli-oiled friends that you have hemp seat covers, while you're
sitting around banging disrythmically on your bong (oops, &quot;bongo&quot;) drums
late into the night while everyone else at the show is trying to sleep.
