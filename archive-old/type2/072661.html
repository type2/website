Subject: air control flaps question


Hi, I know there was talk about the air control flaps about a week or two
ago.  I'm going to install them on my engine this summer.  I have a couple
questions I'm hoping some of you might know.  I have a '71 dp engine, I
just received my connecting rod (rod that opens the flaps), but took flaps
of of a single port '69 (I believe) engine.  The single port engine
connecting rod has 4 holes ( 2 on each end) to open the flaps.  The 'new'
rod I got for my '71 dp engine only has 1 hole on each end.  What I'm
wondering is: can I make those '69 flaps work, or do I have to buy new
flaps that fit a '71 engine?

thanks in advance,
Keri
