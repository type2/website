Don't waste your time with the JB Weld. that was my first attempt at fixing
mine. All it did was waste a few hours waiting on it to dry. I WILL not
work. Just too much oil pressure there. Sounds like you had the same
situation as I did. We left Virginia the day before and had nice warm
weather. But that night it got very cold and we had snow. Started it up to
warm up before we headed on our way and that's when it happened.
Take my advice. the only fix that will ho.do it to tap the hole and thread
some  kind of bolt or plug in there. I have heard of some people using JB
weld over the plugs that are already in place as a precaution. But it will
not hold a plug once it has popped out. Speaking from experience here

Good Luck
