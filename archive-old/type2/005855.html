Subject: Re: [T2] 75 westy table




 [...]

I took a few pics of the 74/75 table I have. Unfortunately, it is missing the
leg. One of these days I may find the leg. 68 to 73 will not work [I have a
bunch of those] and 76 to 79 will definitely not work.
If any one wants me to pmail pics, let me know.

&gt; Gowesty is wrong! That table they picture is for 76 to 69, NOT 74/75.
&gt;
&gt; 74/75 mounts to the wall, is wood grain, has a swing out leg, and the leaf
&gt; slides out. [almost the same as 68 to 73, but they were white or white w/faint
&gt; black lines and no leaf]
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; hey rich.
