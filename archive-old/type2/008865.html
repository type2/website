X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Rollin' your own  . . rubber parts . .

This is more notes to self on a project I have to pursue .

I got rubber boots on my CV's that suck . . I got a couple
rubber elbows in small caliber they say I can't get . .

There are some of the big ducts that you cannot get . . like
the fan to the heater boxes . . like 3&quot; round to some over-size
rectangle . .

They quoted me $18 for 2 little boots that cover the connectors
on the brake master cylinder . .

How about that gas fill neck for almost all these v-dubs . . ?

Let's start by patching up those boots on the M.C. . . .

A fairly good bet is this stuff called &quot;Shoe Goop&quot;  . .
hey, that is the brand name . . :-)

There are several kinds now, I see . . one, &quot;Electrician Goop&quot;
is clear . . may have better electrical properties but may just
be clear . . there's a &quot;Marine&quot; version . .

My brother uses the regular &quot;shoe&quot; stuff and patches his air
raft . . or the water hose, or smears it on a tarp . . seems
to stick . .

So you take your booty and make a mandrel of some nature to 
hold it . .  I was thinking of a small wax candle that would 
fit down in it . . if you use metal or plastic, you'll want  to 
use some &quot;release agent&quot; on the mandrel .  to keep it from 
sticking . .

The boot has cracks in it . . cut those back to good rubber. .
Abrade the areas around the cracks . . .

We used to patch tubes in tires . . tell you . . :-)

Had these &quot;hot patches&quot; . . a rubber patch was stuck to a small
metal frame that was filled with a kind of &quot;punk&quot; . .

Get a patch that fitss your tear, clean and abrade the area around,
swab it down with this rubber cement, peel the cover off the 
rubber patch and position it . . then you screw this clamp down
on the metal frame and set the &quot;pumk&quot; filler on fire . .

It burns up in less than a minute and applies a given amount of 
heat to the raw rubber patch . . this was a real good vulcanizing
job . .

Some tubes would have a blow out . . big rip . .
Many had patches on their patches . . .

So you clean it up the same way, cut a big piece of raw rubber
patch and put it inside the tube . . position and dope . .

Now you start putting a row of hot patches down the length of the
rip like zipper teeth . . then you lap all the patches you just
put down with another row in between . . 

Now you need a boot for your tire . . got a six inch rip in the 
side-wall . .  

If you took one of your old tires and cut off the bead and ground 
all the tread off the outside, you'd have a purchased boot . .
About 18&quot; long . .

You get inside your tire and clean it up good and swab it down 
with that rubber cement . . you don't want that boot slipping 
around in there . .  slam that boot in, get the tube in there 
and remount on the rim while keeping track of that boot . .

I don't think we knew about &quot;balancing&quot; back then . .

Somebody gets  in your car and after a few minutes he asks
&quot;you got a boot in one of your tires?&quot; easy call . . :-)

A purchased boot had feathered edges so it blended with the walls
of the tire and the tube . . a home-made one . . like you found
this tire there alongside the road and cut a chunk out of it .

None of those fancy &quot;feathered&quot; edges on this baby . .

When it goes flat you will have a perfect cut along the edges of 
that boot, in the tube . . .

If your tire had any integrity left at all, you used a piece of 
inner tube for a boot . . just a flat piece over the area involved.

So while you turkies are all caught up in nostalgia, the goop has 
run down your wrist and is on your pants . . :-)

The second best way to patch a tube is do like above and swab
down with the rubber cement, now set the rubber cement on fire. . .
 Just as the flames go out you slap your cold patch on and clamp
or weight it . .

Lastly you got a straight cold patch which is our bag . .

Get a solvent  . . clean and maybe soften these edges you're 
going to patch, abrade before you soften . . rubber cement solvent
works on most things . . N-heptane I think . . MEK is a likely . .

So you want to put a boot in there to make it stronger ?

Scrape away an area in the wax that matches your cracks when 
mounted on your mandrel . . now fill your depression with  goop
and let it dry . .  now just before you slip the boot on the 
mandrel, wet that material already on the mandrel with a little
goop . .  slide your boot down over this . . you got your patch
on the inside . .

So we got a patch on the inside, we fill the cracks and mound it
up like a grave and feather out on the adjacent areas . .

You want Belt and Suspenders, you fill the crack and coat the 
adjacent areas . . now press a piece of gauze down on the whole
thing . . now put another coat over the top of that . .

You want a fiber-glass gauze ? go look in the roofing department.
Or the Door screen stuff . .

Let this mess dry and it should slip off your mandrel . .

Slip out the back and bury your  first attempt down deep in the 
trash barrel . . . :-)  go back in house and start again . . :-)

What if you want to make your own . . ? 

Head down to your Hobby shop and pick up a can of liquid latex . .
Pick up a candle too . . you're now in the condom making business.

They also have some &quot;castable rubber&quot; . . both of these are used 
for making &quot;rubber molds&quot; . . .

I think they have wax rods too, for casting . . .

I need some about 8mm for this rubber elbow I need . .

The post is running on it's own so  if we get seperated . . .

So my rubber elbow . . I take the rod and break in two . .
Now I heat the ends and melt them together at right angles . .
I'm making an elbow  . . so then I build it up at the bend
a little and carve it back down to a good curve aound 
the corner . . 

Now I start coating it all with my rubber stuff . . several
coats till I think it's heavy enough . .

You can speed up your drying with a heat lamp or box . . 

Once big enough . . maybe with some cloth filler in there . 
I break the wax in the elbow and extract it from the rubber. 

The rubber will shrink . . how much can even be controlled with
the fabric you embed . . . 

I'm using moldable rubber here as a coating . . painted or dipped
or troweled with a butter knife . .

If you want to &quot;mold&quot; you have to have a bell glass vacuum 
chamber at least . . suck the air out of your mold . .

That latex you guys are still holding the candle over is used
to dip a figure into . . so  open it up and dip your candle in.

Pull it out, letting drain over the can, then let dry as directed
and re-dip . . keep this up till you get the proper thickness.

You roll it off  the candle . .

This condom shape is similar to what's needed over the end of 
the emergency brake cable tube . . it just needs a hole in 
the end for the cable . . you could even embed a steel washer for
that purpose . .

You want bellows ? just carve them in the wax . .

As long as the rubber will stretch over it . . fabric ? no . .

Keep in mind through-out that You've spent $20 to make any of
these simple forms . . 


As long as we're on patches  . . a hot melt gun works fair . .
Get the softest stuff tho . . not for tires . . :-)

Throw in a hair dryer . .  

Enough of this miniature shit . . let's do a grill . .!

Well . . how about the air duct I spoke of up top . . round
on one end and square on the other . . 

The Hoover did a post on making duct-work out of fiberglass.

Make your forms in his article from styrofoam and like the 
&quot;lost-wax&quot; method, you melt the form out after with gasoline .

On the other hand, it would be nice to use paper and melt it out 
with water . . .
Paper Mache ain't too round . . get some tubes and then wrap with
newsprint till you get the diameter you want . .

They have &quot;kraft&quot; tubes, I think at the hobbyshop . .
Various sizes and 48&quot; long . . ? these peel out from the end .

The rectangular part . . styrofoam . . or  wood or plaster
whatever you can get out  of there . .

One trick is make your form and then cut a wedge in it with 
a band-saw . . such that when the wedge is removed from the 
center, the sides are free to clear walls and lift out . .

Since we are making one of these, clay might be cool . .

Just a shell that you  reach in the end and break out . .

Never forget balsa  wood and doped paper . . :-)

Getting back to makin this pig . .  

You have some dry form you want to make into fiberglass or rubber
Need some release agent . . spray wax . . a coat of shellac . 
There are actual release agents sold at the hobby . .

Now you have that dried on, you slather on a layer of your resin
or rubber . . your resin is definitely 2 part epoxy and so are
many of the elastomers . . (rubber etc)

This fiberglass being epoxy, has a pot life so you put on your
resin and then lay your cloth or mat on over it and start coatiung
with a second coat of resin right away . . mat, which is just 
unwoven fibers, works best in sharp corners . .

I think with the rubber I would try to build up a couple layers
of the rubber  before embedding a fabric . .

Once again, you build it up layer by layer until you have what 
you want . .

With the rubber, where you are fitting over the other part,
leave the fabric out, or arrange the stranding so it can shrink
more around the mating part and hold better . .

On this fiberglass duct, it shouldn't be rigid all the way . .
You need to put some rubber in between to handle vibration . .
Get a stock round rubber hose that runs over to the general
area of the other end . . have the fiberglass come up and meet
that . .

This kind of form . . the pretty side is inside . .
So we want the outside pretty . .

That's another story . . 

One way is to make your mold such that the inside of the mold is 
the outside of your part . . now you just pour a thick slurry of your
rubber in the mold and roll it around till it finally quits moving . .

You build up layers by doing this over and over letting it dry between
applications . . 

When it cures up, it shrinks and will pull away from the wall and you 
can slip it out of your mold . .

You increase your ability to  slide it out by putting a &quot;draft angle&quot;
on your straight sections . . ie. . . the outer end of a tube is bigger
than the end down in the mold . . pulling it out actually moves the part
farther away from the wall . . a wedge . . 5 degrees draft . .

If your part has a big enough shape, you can reach inside and lay up
fabric as you go . .

The other way is to split the mold in two, making up two halves of this
chingadero and then bond  them together . . say a 3&quot; tube . .

You can carve this mold out of solid wood if you want but let's look at
something less perfect . .

Say a 3&quot; tube and we want a bulge on the side for another flange coming
right out of the side of the tube . .

Make up a couple boxes 1-1/2&quot; deep . . each half of the 3&quot; dia. . . 

Cut knotches where your tube comes out of the box form . . the box that
get's the flange bulge, gets a hole right out the bottom too . .

Get some sawdust and some of that dry wood glue . . Elmers . .
Mix this up per instructions on the can and make up a real thick, almost
dry oatmeal mix and fill the box . . one at a time . .

Put your tube shape in your box and pack the sawdust/glue mix down around
it . . in the casting business, they would use sand here and shake it 
down in a vibrator thingy . . 

Let that set up and remove your form . . the tube . . no release agent?
Well another mess for the dumpster . . :-)

Now you got a crude mold half with all kinds of voids in the form . .
Need to fill those with the oatmeal or some type of plastic wood . .

Smooth and sand till you have  what you want . .

Now you can lay up fiberglass or rubber as you like . . with fabric . 

When cured, the two halves lift right out of the mold . . trim your
edges and bond together . . you remembered the release agent this time?

If you run your layup up over the edge of the mold, you can make a flange
that can be bolted together if you like . .

This last mold . . you could use  that Elmers glue/sawdust to make your
part if you like . . just pack it in your mold and let it dry . .

I use paper and epoxy glue to build new handles on tools . .

Materials: I've mentioned a couple . . it's possible that the RTV silicone
we all use for caulking . .  a tube of silicone and a butter knife might
do the chore . . there are also Butyl rubbers . . and latexes . . 
There are roofing materials that are rubber and highly UV stabilized . .

A company named &quot;Devcon&quot; . . they make a product called &quot;Flexane&quot; . .
People use it in the bottom of gravel hoppers . . I've made engine mounts
amd rubber molds out of it . . use it as an adhesive and it is almost
a weld . . 

They have a castable ceramic and a castable titanium too . .

For fabric, I've about covered all that . . the heavy drive belts are made
of many kinds of rubber but  they usually  use a linen fabric . .

How about the pantyhose again .? use that nylon as a guaze fabric in 
your booty . . a paper with a good rag content . . kevlar . .

For a plain vinyl plastic, try that stuff you dip tool handles in . .

The Hoover also  makes a duct out of that spray-can insulating foam  . .
Pat it down with your hands . . 

Possible that rubberized undercoating might work .  . . 

I've had enough . . :-)
