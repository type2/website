Subject: Westy found! and SF-Seattle trip report (very long plus some plea
	s for advice at the end)

So I've only been on the list for only a couple of months. Some members have
been very helpful with advice/wisdom/encouragement. I'm glad to say that my
search is over and I want to thank everyone that helped. I have a couple of
outstanding questions at the end and I fully expect lots of people to skip
over the admittedly verbose trip description :)

Backstory
I've been looking around most of the summer for a good condition 70's westy.
When I was a kid my family went all over Europe (pop in the military) in a
74 yellow/orange westphalia. That left me with a sentimental attraction for
the &quot;merino yellow&quot; color but otherwise just pragmatism (eventually) about
finding a straight bodied 2.0 FI. I've looked at ~9 buses, called on ~25,
and paid for 2 buyers inspections without finding the 'right' bus. I
eventually found out that I was looking I'm glad I was patient. There is  a
lot of garbage out there! whew -- glad I got that off my chest, looking for
a bus these days can be stressful. through all of that I did figure out that
I wanted something reliable, reasonably powerful, and the westy conversion
(as opposed to the more common (imo) ASI up here in the PNW) at a reasonable
price. i settled on a 76-79 westy and have been looking looking looking.
I'll spare you those experiences because I'm sure all of you can already
empathize with the getting your hopes up about he &quot;clean, low miles, rebuilt
motor 1977 westphalia, perfect $2800&quot; ad to find the
rusty-sat-for-3years-bent nose-rebuilt by the owners cousin Lou with some
aftermarket Napa replacements...

Needless to say there were some disappointments.

&quot;the&quot; bus
Early last week I called a woman in California about a bus she had
advertised locally (I had been casting my net in increasingly large circles
thanks to frustration in Seattle and the power of the internet). She had a
76 Merino yellow westphalia that she was asking $3000 for... She was the 2nd
owner and had maintenance records from 1976. The bus had 110,000 miles
total. No rebuild. I spoke to her for about 30 minutes and after thinking
about it called her the next night and we talked for an hour. I had her
crawling around with the cordless, checking under the rugs for rust, etc.
She mostly gave me useful and accurate answers. The bus had a recent front
brake job, new muffler, working heat, little-no rust, all original parts
except childscot, no bondo, but &quot;needed new rear brake shoes.&quot; The total
miles were pretty low compared to the other buses I'd seen but I was worried
about the engine. Because it had oil changes and valve adjustments every
3-5k I was encouraged things might look okay -- I was half right
(foreshadowing)
 

As I was supposed to be on vacation last week anyway I starting feeling
tempted to fly down to the bay area -- at $100 that wasn't much more than
the amount it cost for a local buyer's inspection. After the second
conversation I was so tempted I actually just did it -- Last Wed had me
getting up early for some work, scrambling to the airport stopping only long
enough to pick up a new compression tester and some rear shoes. I took
minimal clothing and the tools I thought I would need and got on the plane.

The owner's partner picked me up at the airport in Oakland and we went to a
hotel parking lot where I started pulling it apart -- well, it must have
looked like that. I really liked the standard interior layout. I didn't want
to deal with a refrigerator and I loved the &quot;well&quot; icebox configuration. I
like the economy of space (any ideas on how to get more seating using the
space behind the passenger seat?) I was immediately impressed with the
interior quality -- no rips or tears, the orginal carpeting was in place,
all the upholstery was there, the cabinet veneer wasn't cracked.  A couple
of handles had the common splitting/electrical tape issue but were otherwise
functional.The exterior was almost as good. The only issues were the
occasional scratch, &quot;freckles&quot; on the nose where tiny rock chips had given
rise to rust under the paint (all spots smaller than a pencil eraser) and a
little bit of rust on the inside seam of the lower lip of the rear hatch. I
hadn't seen an unrestored bus with this little total body rust.

The engine
Fortunately I had made friends with the owner that had picked me up and even
enlisted her help in the compression check so she would know I wasn't trying
to pull the wool. I pulled the plugs and tested cylinder #3 -- my heart sank
when it read 90 lbs. Crusher. I needed to buy a bus that could make it home
to Seattle and this didn't bode well. I ended up looking at 85/135/85/130.
This suggested to me a bus that had been driven without a good understanding
of what California heat can do to an engine -- since #1 and #3 are the
further &quot;inboard&quot; I infer they suffer most when it gets hot but this is wild
speculation on my part. I tried a little oil in these cylinders and #1 went
up 10 lbs and #3 stayed the same. I think that basically spells burnt
exhaust valves with new rings in my future(?) Overall the ~40 lbs of
difference scared me pretty badly but I was pretty lovestruck already.
damn.. 

I drove it at that point and noticed it felt pretty tight, someone had put
in Monroe shocks. It pulled a little to the right at speed and there was a
high pitched whistle under heavy braking. There was also a lot pedal
pumping. When I rear wheels there was plenty of lining left and no obvious
leakage. There was a lot of scale built up though. I figured either the
drums were out of round or the scale was doing it. mental note. The
whistling was from the brake booster -- I still haven't ascertained if I
have a hose off or if the booster is 4 hooves to the moon. It explains why
the car was dying when I braked with the clutch in though. I bumped the idle
up a hair and it's okay for now.

I spoke with the 'managing' owner on the phone and she said she would come
to the parking lot to talk with me but was committed to not going under
$2500. I was thinking &quot;that seems like a lot change for something that is
rebuild-ready!&quot; When the owner showed up we had some protracted discussion
and I went through the list of issues (bad top seal, etc.) In the end I gave
her 22 Ben Franklins and drove away. wow.

the trip
I got immediately lost in SF (all because I had some childish desire to
drive my new bus across the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset). By the time I got
there it was dark and foggy, oh well. That first night I made it up 101 to
Petaluma and slept in a big parking lot. I loved being able to draw those
funky orange curtains and turn on the light and read for a while -- not
quite rustic camping but definitely satisfying. I awoke early and got on the
road (I was driving 101 because I figured it to be less taxing on the motor
and hopefully prettier). I stopped in Hopland and had a great Breakfast and
the Bluebird Diner. At this point I was going through the beautiful Humboldt
area. I picked up a hitcher here named &quot;Moon&quot; who warned me about all of the
cops and otherwise gave me some good chuckles. I've never picked up
hitchhikers before but for some reason it's really hard to drive by them
with an empty bus. I don't know how else to explain it. I eventually picked
up 3 more on my way north, each riding for a 2-20 miles and then getting out
only to be replaced eventually. In nocal I can vividly recall the emerald
trees over the golden grass. Those two colors sort of sum up that part of
the drive. As it got hotter I tried to stay at 50 mph but the engine started
to miss on hills. At one point it got so bad I pulled over to let things
cool off. 45 minutes later and I just *barely* got it started. In Eureka I
pulled off and starting asking for VW mechanics. By late Friday afternoon I
found a guy in Arcata willing to talk to me. He was awesome -- spent about
40 minutes going over everything, ground wires, etc. He advanced the timing
a hair and told me to test drive it and return with &quot;a cold 6pack of good
beer if it ran better.&quot; I brought back a 12 pack and said thanks. An hour
later it started to miss again but not as bad. As it got cooler the missing
went away altogether. At sunset I pulled off at Gold Bluff beach. What an
amazing place! There were roosevelt elk all over the place, just hanging out
at this remote beach. I got back on the road and made it to Oregon (just
past Gold Beach) before pulling over again to sleep. Many places on the
Oregon coast are clearly posted no camping but the overlooks weren't and I
didn't get hassled. The next morning I started back up 101. The road is very
twisty but very beautful. It was hard to not have a surfboard with me and
the time to liesurely pull off and use it but seeing the waves was pretty
good alone. By Newport the reaffic was so intense I had to pull off again
and take Hwy 20 to Corvallis. HOT -- the engine never got as bad as the day
before but the missing worried me and I hated to think about a rod going
through the case because of a sucked valve :(

Finally I made I5 north and promptly hit Friday afternoon traffic in
Portland. A little word of advice -- STAY AWAY FROM PORTLAND ON FRIDAY
AFTERNOONS IN AUGUST. It must have been well over 100 degrees on the
asphault in stop/go traffic. I was really worried about the bus but made it
to the bridge into Washington and pulled off. Aside from a wasted 1.5 hours
I can't recall being so personally overheated in my life. It was that hot. I
waited until almost dark to get back on the road. I stopped again in Olympia
for a lovely burger at  a Denny's clone and took a nap (the driving started
to take its toll on me). When I woke up I got back on I5 and made it to
Seattle around 3am and breathed a huge sight of relief. What a trip --even
if it was my first. I hope to make it again but next time with more time and
more confidence in the engine.

whew. A few outstanding questions..

*	I am staring at a potential rebuild. With 2 good cylinders and a bus
that seems to run great around town (it will easily do 65 on the highway but
I don't push it) it is hard to justify the cash outlay but it seems prudent.
Do I have any *good*  alterntatives?

*	The boost pump -- how can I get to this and how much does it cost to
rebuild?

*	tires -- the front tires look pretty old but have plenty of tread --
any PNW recommendations for 76 westy?

TIA for your help (and if you read this long, just thanks for your
interest!)
