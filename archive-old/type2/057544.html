&gt;Hey all,
&gt;Just a question regarding the ECU, I am guessing that the ECU has no
&gt;computer memory or chip components and is a simple system of on/off
&gt;switches based on receiving electrical current or not. If that is the
&gt;case then Y2K is not an issue. So I am not concerned about it. Can
&gt;someone verify this, or alert us to possible Y2K problems. Not that it
&gt;will really matter much when the power grid fails, but in case the grid
&gt;doesn't fail and such would like to be prepared when I return to the US.

I believe it is mostly transistorized components but even if this is not
the case, since there is no provision for ever setting the date on it in
the first place, it would have no idea when the year 2000 rolls around
anyway.

&gt;BTW if you are at all interested in Y2K or you have not given it much
&gt;thought get the August issue of Wired mag. It is an eye opener to be
&gt;sure. Thanks,

No thanks; this whole Y2K thing is WAY overhyped as it is, IMO.  :-)
