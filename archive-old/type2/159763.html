&gt; So we take care of it and hope that maybe one day if the time comes to
&gt; have to part with it (dire necesity only) we may get most of our 'investment'
&gt; back.  For us, the 'investment' is free accommodation when we travel,  the
&gt; freedom to camp where &amp; when we wish (within legal bounds), the room
&gt; to sleep the 3 of us and enjoy the time on the road as a family.

Bravo!  You had me scared there for a minute!

I don't understand it when people say they want to preserve the resale 
value of their bus.  I could care less about resale value because I will 
not be selling my bus... ever.  Do some people really think of a bus as 
temporary transportation?

I only care about keeping my bus roadworthy so that it can be used for 
its intended purpose - putting smiles on people's faces (mostly my own).
