&gt;I haven't seen or heard anything of Steve Dolan's whereabouts since being
&gt;told
&gt;he'd left Seattle headed for Missoula.  Anyone have any clues as to his
&gt;location and welfare?

As of Tuedsay afternoon he was in Madison, Wisconsin. He said he was headed
east and was looking for Jeff Marek's address in Chicago.
