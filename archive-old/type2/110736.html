Subject: Re: [T2] Re: where to find GL4 80W90 gear oil

seth the GL-% and combo GL-3,4,5  and GL-3 are no good they will eat your tranny gears up from what i have heard and read.
I finally found the GL-4 85W90 oil at napa auto parts 
3.99 a quart.
Cha



Why not just use some Castrol 80W90 Hypoy C gear oil which says on the 
&gt;back &quot;exceeds GL5 standards&quot;. I've run it before and not had any problems. I 
&gt;honestly couldn't tell you what GL3,4,5 means so I might be missing something 
&gt;here.
