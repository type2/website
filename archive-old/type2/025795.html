Hi Eric,

Here in the Canadian rust belt where they salt the roads 5 months of the
year we have a lot of shops that offer under-body oil spray rust prevention.
I know a lot of people who would send their car religiously every fall for a
respray. IMHO it never made a noticable improvement -- these people already
was their car regularly and trade it before it gets rusty anyway.

A much better, modern solution is a product like Mar-Hyde's &quot;One-step&quot;. It's
similiar to POR-15 as far as I've been told. It's available in a spray or
liquid, once applied it bonds with the rust to form an inert compound which
is much harder than rust, and it coats that metal with a sealer so it can't
rust any further. One-Step isn't as cheap as 10-W-30, but it's less than
$10.

I used one-step on my bus last spring and it stopped the rust dead in its
tracks. 11 months later the rust has not yet resurfaced through any of the
areas I treated with one-step.

Check out the link to JC Whitney:

I don't work for these guys, I don't make a penny either way.


Happy trails,

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; rust is slowly attacking my rocker panels ,wheel arches and various other
&gt;&gt; places. what is a good preventative maintenence job i could do to stop the
&gt;&gt; process until i can go ahead and get the job done right.. How do
&gt;&gt; I slow down
&gt;&gt; the process of surface rust.
&gt; 
&gt; A real quick cheap one is to paint oil on the surface.. it soaks nicely in
&gt; and provides a barrier to air and water. reapply as necessary. Wash it off
&gt; later with petrol.
