I need to locate a master cylinder and vaccum booster
 for a 71 VW Single Cab
T2 Truck.
Anyone have them or know where to get them?
&lt;&lt;

the MC should be fairly easy to find from any of the vendors.

try bustedbus_dot_com for the booster. or a salvage yard.

also, there's a place in TX that rebuilds boosters. quite
a few listees have posted positive feedback.

good luck,
