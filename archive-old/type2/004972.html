The spill about previous rebuilds is so common...Most of those rebuilds make
the engine worse thatn it was before...

&gt; &lt;&lt; did you see the paperwork for that rebuild?? could have just been a top
&gt; end rebuild, which may or may not have been done right &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I read and hear over and over again, &quot;previous owner said it was rebuilt
&gt; [insert value that sounds low, but high enough to show oil leaks] miles
ago&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;rant mode: on&gt;
&gt; Does NO ONE keep receipts for this sort of thing?  Should I honestly
believe
&gt; that someone will spend spend between $1000 and $3000 on rebuilds knowing
&gt; that it will add to the value of the car and keep NO records of it?  Hey,
you
&gt; have the title and insurance info, where's the rest off the papework?
&gt;
&gt; Am I unrealistic to maintain that no dated records to the contrary can
ONLY
&gt; indicate a running used engine/trans that at worst could be the original
and
&gt; may sieze next week?
&gt; &lt;rant mode: off&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What do all of you do?  Do you typically toss all receipts for repairs
over
&gt; $500 because a mumbled reference to them occuring over the last 2
&gt; years/25,000 miles is a more effective way to sell the car?  Is this
&gt; phenomenon unique to the VW world?
&gt;
&gt; I realize careful pre-purchase analysis could indicate otherwise, and yes,
it
&gt; can help establish a fair vehicle price.
