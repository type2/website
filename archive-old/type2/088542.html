Subject: carb question on 1970 T2

------=_NextPart_000_0031_01C26390.81463E60
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a 1970 bus.  I bought a Brosol replacement carb for it, and it =
seemed to me that it ran pretty rich judging by the tailpipe and spark =
plugs.  I pulled that main jet and found that it came with a 120.  The =
stock jet for a 1970 is a 112.5.  The info in the library says that the =
1968-1969 30 pict 2 came with a 125 main and a smaller pilot jet (55 vs. =
65 on the 1970).  When I search the archive people are talking about =
running 130 and larger!!  I have the stock single port 1600cc with =
compression set to 7:1 (cc'd and rebuilt the motor last week).  What do =
you recommend for jets and why?  Why is the 1970 setup so much different =
from other years, and the jet size people say they are running?  One =
more question:  I get a poppity popitty pop when I lift the throttle and =
ride the motor on compression.  What causes this?  A few things to =
consider:  I ditched the vacuum assembly emission control thing that =
holds the throttle open when you lift up because it wasn't working right =
and was annoying.  I have the stock (but rebuilt) vacuum advance =
distributer set to 30 degrees at full advance.

Thanks,

Jarred
