Jaime,
Check your flasher relay....Mine was doing the same odd things and then some.
Sometimes it would work fine then a brake light would be out, throw in a turn
signal not working once in a while... What it meant for me was blinker fluid
in the relay. (rainwater)  I took the flasher relay out and shook it, sure
enough full of water.

You can try drying them out but they don't seem to work quite right.  Ask me
how I know.

The relays go for &gt;15 US.  Worth a try.  Worked for me.

Peace Brother,
