&gt; I know one Virginia Type 4 rebuilder who would love to
&gt; buy a line bore rig.  Anyone know of any shops ready
&gt; to get rid of theirs.

Why not try Mark Stephens.  It seems that there are rumors of his company's
demise and they might have a tool or two for sale.
His web site is still down and last month there were reports of no one being
home out there.
