Subject: Re: [T2] Cookin' the hub - it's done, anyone want a bite?

&gt; My point being, to have the tools *in advance* of the immediate need, since
&gt; one knows (Muir and Bentley) that they will be needed eventually.  The same
&gt; goes for replacement parts.

Does this mean I need to go out and drop $$$ on every possible tool I might
need to handle a breakdown? Part of life is learning to make due with what
you've got. I also used a brick (just a plain-old-red-brick) on my floor jack
to give myself an extra lift. That's not a standard tool, but it works. And
yes, I did put my jack stands under the frame too. I may be crazy, but I'm not
too stupid...

&gt;&gt; store where I bought the bearing, not the VW garage I tried to get to do it
&gt;&gt; but they were slammed...
&gt;
&gt; Try looking in the books that deal with the topic (Muir and Bentley) and
&gt; the Type2 Library.

Hmmm...

Muir - page 180 - no specific mention of doing both. But he's using a chisel
to remove the races. Shame on him for not having the right tools ahead of
time...

Bentley - Section 2, page 8 - no mention that bearings need to be replaced
together. But it says you should use a dial indicator to measure the axial
play in the wheel. Darn, I didn't get one of those.

Haynes - Chapter 11, P. 175 - Again, no mention that bearings are to be
replaced together...

Sorry to be such a stickler...

BTW, I went to three different 'convenience' FLAPS today - Pep Boys, AutoZone
and Advance. Pep Boys carries el-cheapo bearings and a pretty rigid inner
seal. AutoZone, according to their website, has the Beck/Arnley inner seal and
a choice between good bearings and el cheapos (a difference of about
$5/bearing), but the store has the bearings and the seals are actually
mislabled bearings. Advance had cheap bearings also, but no seals. I ended up
going back to Pep boys for their seal... The woes of using a bus as a daily
driver.

On the positive side, I can now replace the bearings in about an hour per
wheel. And I did by a set of drifts.

&gt; the opinions of Parts Monkeys are not usually.........._dot_useful.

Hmmm... This parts monkey was, I believe, the owner of the VW parts store. I
think it may be a matter of opinion.

-Eric
