Subject: 79 motor oil leak found but need help!

I may have found the source of the oil leak in the '79 type4 motor 
but I need some help because I do have a Bentley Manual available.

Early today I posted about a leak at the rear of the motor that I 
though might be from the area of the fan housing. I was just outside 
looking of the clean parking place that I put the bus in the see 
where the first drops were coming from. It was to the right and 
slightly forward of the fan. Since it was dark I decided to feel 
around under the bus for a fresh oily spot.

BINGO. the filler neck tube that connects to the case was the 
oiliest. I wiggled the tube and could feel a bit a looseness. I felt 
around for the bolts. First I found the bottom one. There was not 
bolt in to top - just a hole where I suspect a bolt should be. I do 
not have a Bentley handy to see how the setup is supposed to be. Can 
anyone confirm that there should be two bolts holding the metal 
portion of the neck to the case? What size is the bolt -length, 
diameter and thread size?

I would take out the lower one and check but the engine carrier is in 
the way. It looks like the top one (which is missing) can be replaced 
without removing everything.

Thanks
