Subject: Re: [T2] muffler heat shield

&gt;You know that asbestos-laden rectangular heat shield that goes just above
&gt;the muffler and is held in place by connections to a couple of rear tin
&gt;screws? Mine is so rusty that the connectors have failed and it is
&gt;falling off. It rattles terribly up there at idle, but I don't think it
&gt;can actually fall out of there.

Mine cracked at the attachment points and came loose on the way to Havasu
earlier this year. Makes a gawd-awful racket -- sounds expensive. David
took mine out by removing the three rear pieces of engine tin and angling
it up and out. When I asked the Almighty List, it turns out most of these
items are long gone on a lot of buses -- some people didn't even know there
was originally a heat shield on their bus.

Fortunately, I found a replacement at a junkyard. Unfortunately, I forgot
to install it when I replaced my muffler. I had to practically bend a few
basic laws of physics to get it into place without removing and
reinstalling the muffler, but I did it -- so, yes, it could actually fall
out of there.

&gt;It's intended to insulate the rear tin from intense radiant heating from
&gt;the blazing hot muffler. So it's part of the cooling system.
&gt;Anyone else run for extended periods without this part? Does bus run
&gt;hotter? Do rear tin seals get crisped or melted?

It may not *officially* be part of the actual cooling system. That could
(and probably will) be argued. :-) But most buses seem to do just fine
without it -- mine did for about three months, and think of all those
people who've been going along just fine for ages without knowing it was
even supposed to be there.

&gt;I want to
&gt;replace mine, but no one seems to sell them. I was just advised by one VW
&gt;shop to get some kind of insulating muffler tape made for racers and wrap
&gt;my muffler in the stuff. That could work, I guess.

My understand is they're NLA. Unless you have the Junkyard Goddess smiling
down on you and find one lying in the dirt. :-)

&gt;Anyone else ever replace this part? I was hoping to find some kind of
&gt;non-asbestos, after market replacement.

I remember a conversation in the chat room where we brainstormed designs
for home-made versions, and an &lt;insert metal of choice here&gt; sheet of the
proper dimensions, bent at the proper points, drilled out and bolted on
sounded like the most elegant solution. You could feasibly wrap *that* in
muffler tape, eh? Someone with better physics knowledge than I suggested
painting the top/bottom black/white (don't remember which) to further
enhance heat reflection/absorption.

P.S. I sent my old heat shield to a list member on the off-chance he might
be willing to fabricate replacements, but my guess is he's too busy with
real money-making work to devote much energy to the project. :-)
