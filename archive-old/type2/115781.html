&gt; It occurs to me that whenever the Cuban embargo ends, there is

If you did find one probably only part of the body would be original anyway.
Cuba has an underground mechanics business that keeps those old cars going.
Remember the chicken wire jokes?

They fabricate parts because they've never been available and often swap in
parts like brakes from Russian cars especially items like pistons from
foreign cars with similar bore and stroke. They look good for the
frankensteins that they are.
