Subject: Cleaning the padded dash board
Date: Sat, 7 Oct 2000 21:14:45 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

what would be the best way to clean the padded *material* part of the
dashboard?

the bus *71* was in one of those *shifting sands of New Mexico* paint shops
recently and we got the 10 foot special, spray job.  The windshield was
removed to do some front skin welding under it,  and when they did the
priming &amp; painting they didn't bother to cover the dash.  I have tried
simple green, but it still has this grayish white film over it when it's
dry.

would acetone on a terrycloth towel work?  Don't want to use the wrong
stuff,  and destroy the padding.
It's actually in good condition with no cracks or damage, except for the
over spray.

TIA

Bob
