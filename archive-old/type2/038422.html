Subject: Planning My First Engine Pull

Rob Weisel  ----

Don't make the mistake I made [some years ago] during a hurried
mid-70s Westy engine removal.  I had done lotsa Bugs and earlier Type
2s, of course..... but failed to read up on the then-current
engine/trans mounting system.

SUPPORT THE TRANS at the bellhousing end..... otherwise when you pull
the engine, the trans will drop and you will trash your CV joints.
