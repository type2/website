Subject: BeetleMex Engine?

I'm thinking of getting a new BeetleMex engine to put in my '71 bus because
I'm going to be in Arizona in December.

One thing that kinda bothers me though is that on the BeetleMex site there
is a note that says. . .

	(Distributor drive gear not included)

Doesn't this mean that I will have to bust the engine apart to press the
drive gear onto the crankshaft?

Wouldn't this void the warranty?

Has anyone on the list got a BeetleMex engine? Any tips? . .  Comments?
