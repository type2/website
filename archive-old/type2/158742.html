Subject: Timing off by 180??

Hi Volks,

I can't figure out why my timing is off so far.  I
have a 2ltr with FI (76 drivetrain in a 72 bus). It
has a stock vacuum advance distributor. I replaced a
vacuum hose and no change. I'm just a backyard tune-up
machanic with just a parking lot to work on my bus in.
 I'm thinking somehow the distriputor is off my 1800
degrees. But how can this be? When I turn the
distributor as far as it will go to the right I am
still off by at least 3 degrees to the left of the
correct timing mark.  I'm not sure how to fix this or 
where esle to look. Could a vacuum leek cause this?
Any other ideas?

Thanks,

Rae
