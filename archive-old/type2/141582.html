Subject: RE: [T2] Hankook Tires are back!

&gt;&gt;  After I spoke to Vredestein, they managed
&gt;&gt;  to find me 8 sets in Holland, which supposedly are
&gt;&gt;  on their way now (to arrive in about a month).

&gt;    What would the original production run have been... ?-(


A lot more than eight sets, I'm sure!  I'd guess that the rest were already
sold to tire retailers within Europe (which is where Vredestein does most of
their business).
