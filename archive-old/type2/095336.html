Subject: Re: [T2] Metal brake lines



&gt;I'm having a hard time finding metal brake lines that go from the hoses to
&gt;the calipers/wheel-cylinders.

I redid all the metal lines on my friends bus, a 71. I measured the old ones 
and just went down to napa and bought all I needed. The longest line font to 
back I just used 2 and joined them with a coupler that I bought there also. 
You just carefully bend them into the same curves. Sure some are a little 
longer or a little shorter then the others, but with a little creative 
curving they look near stock. Also I took the time to paint them before they 
went on, they looked real nice.

Jason
