&gt;one of the guys on the vanagon list got this message and wanted
&gt;it forwarded to the type2 list members.

&gt;&gt;     Two friends and I just bought the contents of a vw yard in Fort
&gt;&gt; Pierce, FL.  There are 22 bay window buses about half of which are
&gt;&gt; campers.  Although the buses themselves are all very rusted, alot of the interiors are in good shape.  Let me know where to post this most effectively.  I'll further check out your site, we've been swamped with work on this project as we've been given 90
&gt;days to clear this place out.  We're selling complete cars for $75 and everything is cheap!  We would like to help out as many vw heads like us before it's all scrapped.

&gt;Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Dave Walgrave
