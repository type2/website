Subject: &quot;Golde&quot; sliding metal sunroofs to fit 1968-1972 VW Westfalia
  busses   

I see a lot of people are looking for these units and related hardware.
Does this company still exist? Has anyone ( Golde or aftermarket )
considered making reproduction units? Sure seems like somebody could
fill a hole in the market, literally and figuratively, and make some
money to boot! Alternativly,has anyone produced a vinyl sliding or
removable one that FITS the hole without cutting the body?  Any input on
this would be much appreciated.                            mahalo, tim
