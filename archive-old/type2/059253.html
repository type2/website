     I sure never had a problem starting my bus with a Weber progressive even
in the coldest WI winter. You just have to take the time to warm it up
afterwards before driving away -- which is actually a plus. Driving off
without a proper warmup with *any* car, especially in cold weather, is a
no-no.

&gt; In my humble fuel injected mind the best thing you can do is either get
&gt; another set of carbs (preferebly solex) or change the thing back to FI,
&gt; which was probably what it was designed to be in the first place.
&gt;

      Well, I went back to FI, which is indeed much superior, but Solex sure
as heck aren't superior to Webers. It's the other way around. Interestingly, I
just bought a new toy -- a '73 Opel GT. The GT came with a Solex carb, but the
big thing for GT users is putting a Weber on them. Or Bosch FI -- and it's
essentially the exact FI system I've got on my bus. Hope I can find a later
Opel donor to snatch the FI from, but until then I've got a good use for my
old Weber.
