&gt; .....Water got inside the crank case when I cleaned it..... 
 
I don't want to put a downer on this but I'd be very wary of getting 
water in the crank case while cleaning it.  I don't think the moisture 
content would be such a problem, rather any grit or dirt it may be 
carrying with it.

Just a thought.
