Hi Barry, sorry about the earlier misfire...

I have heard the same results with the bosch multifire plugs, as well as 
other similar designs (multiple electrodes)... I have never tried them to 
check the validity of the statement, tho.

&gt; Years ago I had a mate who reckoned with the efficiency of CD ignition in
&gt;  his van he could run it a lot leaner becase all the petrol in the chamber
&gt;  burned instead of 2/3. He claimed terrific mileage per gall. Does this 
sound
&gt;  right??
