Subject: Re: [T2]child seats and child comfort

Since nobody else has responded...

My little girl will turn 1 on Wednesday. So she's not ready for the booster
yet...

But WalMart has lapbelt boosters for under $20. They have an arm that holds
the child in place like a roller coaster ride and the belt goes around the
arm.

Another option for the very back seat would be to mount a 3 point
seatbelt... Bottom 2 attach points stock and the shoulder point to the top
of the engine box. Takes some metal modification but you get a shoulder belt
in the back that way... May want to get a corner seat guide for the shoulder
belt, like many new vehicles use to position the seat belt at shoulder
height while the mounting point is lower.

Let us know what you do (with pics!)

&gt; just curious on all those that have children and how you accomidate them
in the back seats with car seats?
&gt;
&gt; i know it is diffrent for each state on the laws of how many pounds for
certain seats and such to booster seats and all..?
&gt;
&gt; ok my thing is my child is big enough for a booster seat which is just the
bottom part of a child seat  but is suppose to get a arm belt pulled over
and snapped...~!~(like the front seat belts)
&gt;
&gt; being the back seat it is not able to use the booster cause there is only
lap belts...
&gt; being only lap belts she is haveing to ride in the car seat which runs the
lap belt in behind the seat always keeping the car seat strapped in .....
&gt; the car seat it's self has buckles for her to buckle with....
&gt;
&gt; surely the other bus parents can help me figure out how to get her booster
seat in there....
&gt; will i need to install somehow the front kind of belts in back ??????
wouldnt know where to start or is there another way you all have done this
legally and safe..?
&gt;
&gt; Safety is my number one concern here of course... ~!~
&gt; thanks for all or any help..
&gt; peace
&gt; Cha
&gt; ps down in my state ( SC) the cops take seat belts very seriously... not
to mention as well in North Carolina which we visit alot...
&gt; want her to be safe but also need her to be able to be comfortable to
enjoy the ride also.... the seat looks so uncomfortable.. the car seat shes
in right now..~!~
