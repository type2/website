Subject: Homemade car bra

I decided to make my own car bra for the hell of it because the material is
only $7/yard. Unfortunately the old bra that came with the bus rotted and
was thrown away a few years ago. So, I don't have a pattern but that's not
going to stop me.

Does anyone have any tips for attaching the bra? I was thinking of using a
combination of things including some strong magnets. I can't seem to find
those flexible clips that most bras use for attachment. Any ideas?
