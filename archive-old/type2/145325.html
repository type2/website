&gt; I have a suggestion: Parked trucks over here in Germany
&gt; often have huge reflective signs on them (I'm not sure
&gt; if they're required or anything).  Almost a metre square
&gt; in size.  Hard to overlook, even on purpose.  If you
&gt; can't find something like that, maybe a traffic sign
&gt; or similar?  Anything big, reflective, and bright in
&gt; colour.

OTOH, if you attract the eye of the drunk toward your bus, he might just
swing his steering wheel that way

One might take an idea from the utility companies.  Often their trucks
come equipped with a traffic cone that the worker puts out a few feet away
from the vehicle.  Sometimes it is attached with a cord to prevent its
walking away.  When in motion, the cone lives on a peg under the vehicle
or on its bumper.

Putting the cone a few feet away from the vehicle gives the drunk
something to aim at.
