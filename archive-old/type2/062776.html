&gt;I did learn that it would be nice to have a second exit from a bus 
&gt;that's crashed onto it's right side.  Previous post details exit 
&gt;handle location for a Vanagon rear hatch.

This reminds of the time I was following Bay Window Westy onto the freeway via a
cloverleaf.  Somehow she just kind of spontaneously tipped over, never figured
out why, since my '65 Splittie was handling just fine.  Anyway, the driver and
passenger got out via the back door which I opened from the outside.  They were
dazed and a little confused, but not as bad for wear and tear and the Westy was.
 I could see the water tank dripping steadily from one side of the sideways bus
to the other, and imagined the battery doing the same thing in the engine
compartment.  Since it was at an angle favorable to uprighting, I suggested a
little muscle effort might put things at a correct angle, but they wanted to
wait for a tow truck.

Ah well the thing was probably totalled anyway, as it had slid quite a ways on
its side.

peace,
terry
