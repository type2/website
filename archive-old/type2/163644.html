Subject: Re: [T2] Foldable Spare

Now what i have been looking for would be a &quot;spare replacement&quot; where the
rim would still have the 5 x 112 but the backspacing and overall width of
the tire would be smaller so that i can mount it UNDER the bus. I was
thinking of rerouting the heater tubes (when i replaced anyways, maybe
adding another aux fan) and that would be plenty of room to mount the spare
tire under the passenger side in the middle - kinda just under the sliding
door.

I already have the mount for it - I just have not been able to find that
rim....

any ideas?
