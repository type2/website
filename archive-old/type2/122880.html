Subject: Re: Loose shifter

&gt;I have a problem with my 1971 bus shifter.  It became loose and started
&gt;to rotate around and would not shift gears.  I replaced the shifter, this
&gt;seemed to help for a little while.  Then the new shifter became loose and
&gt;would rotate and not shift.  I believe that the shift rod?, the place
(snip)

check out the illustration on http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/shifter79.html you
can't see very well there is a pin in at the bottom end of the shift lever
that keeps it from rotating, and also a spring in there.  It sounds like
yours wore through, but it is strange that your replacement did not have one
either (or worked for a short time then did not).  You may have to clean off
some heavily caked old gunk to see how this really works, I sure did.

As you may know, this pin rides in a slot in the &quot;front shift rod&quot; which is
illustrated next to the &quot;front shift rod bushing&quot; (E); check the condition
of this slot to make sure it is not too buggered and observe how it must
work.  You might as well replace bushing (E) while you are in there, and
check your stop plate (D) which will also require alignment, consult the
Bentley manual or the type2_dot_com library.

If you still need a new pin/spring, check with a used parts supplier such as
BustedBus, I dunno if this is available new.  Maybe another friendly listee
has one laying around. . . be sure to lube it up packed full of with grease
when you put it together (I use white lithium grease but any all-purpose
grease will suffice).

Hope that helps.
