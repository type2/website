&gt; On Wednesday morning I found what appears to be a transmission input
&gt; shaft wrapped in plastic grocery bags jammed into my driver's door
&gt; handle.  I hope it was wrapped in plastic bags to avoid scratching the
&gt; paint.  I think it was in the door handle so I would notice it.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any theories?  I can't believe that one of my neighbors
&gt; had this lying around the house, noticed I had a bus and then decided
&gt; to donate it anonymously.  Of all the VW parts you might have lying
&gt; around, why this one?  Is this the first clue in a mystery I'm
&gt; supposed to solve?  Has anyone had something like this happen to them
&gt; before?

just a thought, having not seen what they stuck in your door handle, but
the tranny pump shaft in an auto tranny has a bad habit of falling out.
there is the possibility that someone was towing an auto tranny bus
without it's engine and this fell out on the street (heck it could be the
one I lost during a tow a few years back)  someone saw it and said &quot;Hey he
has a bus maybe he can use it.&quot;

the auto tranny pump shaft is about as big around as a little finger and
maybe a foot and a half long....FWIW
