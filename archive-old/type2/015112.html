Hi all,

I'm having problems with my '81 Westy (automatic).  The starter won't spin.
 It simply clicks.  I was able to get the bottom bolt out but I am puzzled
as to how to get the top bolt out.  I can't seem to find a socket or wrench
to fit over the bolt head because the bolt is so close to the housing it is
attached to.  Any suggestions as to how I can get it out??

Also, I was wondering if the starter that fits a '80 Westy with a Manual
Transmission could be used to fit my '81 Westy with an automatic
transmission.  (can I take the two starters and make one??)

Any help will be GREATLY Appreciated:-)

Thanks,

Keith
