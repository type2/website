Subject: Re: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

Jacques in Yakima-

If you think you can fix this bus, do it.
Since you took the time  to have it inspected
by a frame specialist and he suggested you
replace the wheel assembly components,
then is is repairable, so do it.
Replace the whole wheel assembly and go for an alignment.
This will show any additional work to be done.
And then you will no longer claim beginner status.

Subject: [T2] newbie repairing totaled bus

&gt;My '78 Campmobile is totaled according to our insurance company.  I took it
&gt;to the frame and axel place in town.  He said the driver's side rear arm,
&gt;spring plate, and probably the spindle are bent.  He recommended I try to
&gt;pull the whole unit of a junkyard bus (if I can find one). Here's my
&gt;questions:
&gt;1. What year busses would have these units that would work in a '78?
&gt;2. Are regular bus and westy bus rear ends the same?
&gt;3. Is this a job a beginner should tackle?
&gt;4. What years rear bumpers would work for my '78?
&gt;I really would like to resurect this bus.  Although we only had it for a
&gt;year, we had some great times in it, and it's a great runner.  I'll worry
&gt;about the body and interior damage later but would like to get it up to
&gt;passing our state (Washington) state patrol inspection in order to get our
&gt;title back.
