sorry typo it should say

&gt;  keeping the bus running and drivable while working on it means cutting
&gt; every job down to very small managable units. so you can finish and get
&gt; back on the road.  so if someone else tells you the job will take x number

&gt; of hours. if that X is more than &gt;HALF&lt; what you have on any given day

&gt; triple the time it will take to get it done in setup and cleanup time.

sorry bout that
