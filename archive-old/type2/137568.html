&gt;Anyone know whether anybody has tried to provide &quot;refurbished&quot; buses (or 
&gt;any vehicle, for that matter)? It would be nice to go to a refurbisher -- 
&gt;not a restorer -- and buy a baywindow for, say, $6000 to $10000 with maybe 
&gt;a two-year parts and labor guarantee.

You find me a market and I will contract that service within such a budget 
as an actual inspection of the proposed candidate will show. Very much I 
have done this with several Porsches and Mercedes. I have talked to many 
with Busses about this but they never show up with the candidate and 
earnest money.
