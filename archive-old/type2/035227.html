Subject: Re: Cost of Owning a Bus

&gt; Ive been watching and thinking as this thread unravels and...
&gt; Even at 5000$ and maybe anothe 500-1000 annually for maintaining there
&gt; arent many other vehicles cheaper to operate.
&gt; Any 20-30 (or even 40-50) YO vehicle is not going to be as reliable as a
&gt; brend new one but I still see new cars broken down all the time on the
&gt; side of the xway so nothing is foolproof.
&gt; Look around at the cars on the road? How many are as old as your bus? It
&gt; says quite a bit about the design that we have these out there.
&gt; I like not being in the disposable car loop.
&gt; I love the feeling of busses and if I look at the cars on the road there
&gt; are few which I see myself driving happily down the road.
&gt; And (to paraphrase the beer commercial) 'I love you guys' weep weep

I have a 1994 dodge intrepid and bought an old 73 bus (rust, ran poorly,
$1200) to replace it. Why? Cause the intrepid has broken down twice on me
for no reason! Its never been in an accident, never even has hit a curb, yet
it has broken down twice. The first time the repair bill was $590, had to
have the throttle body removed and cleaned due to some misfiring from bad
plug wires that still had almost 10,000 miles before scheduled to be
replaced. The second time cost $950 to get new tie rods because the bushings
in them squished out and was metal to metal which ruined the rods. This is
not to mention the new brake rotors I had to put on it after it was only 2
years old. Did I mention how much it costs for everyday items like new brake
pads and tires? Did I mention I was paying $206 a month in car payments? I
could have put a new engine in a bus for those kind of repair bills. Save my
car payments 3 months and I could get a new trany for a bus, installed.

Take my bus. It ran like crap and cost me about $250 for a whole NEW carb
and various intake manifold gaskets. Now it runs like a champ. I was able to
replace it myself with a few basic tools. Labor wouldn't have been much more
if I had to have a shop do it. I do expect that the bus will consume more of
my time, but I carry a small box full of misc small parts like light bulbs,
belts, hoses, duck tape, flashlight, clamps, a rag, etc for roadside
emergencies. So far the only thing I have had to do on the road was replace
a fan belt.

But the best part is that I LOVE to drive the bus! Its just fun. Don't know
why, not even a clue. I just get this fun feeling when I drive. Leaning
forward resting my arms on the steering wheel tapping my fingers on the dash
to music from the radio. Maybe because I'm thinking of all the fun I'm gonna
have camping next summer in my bus. Maybe looking forward to when me and 5
co-workers pile in it to go to lunch and have a blast, such a simple
activity. I don't know, but its great fun. I can also carry large items in
it so I don't have to bug friends for their trucks all the time.

I'm happy with the bus that I *own*. Any money I dump into it directly
improves it. Its fun to drive and more functional (for me at least). If I
had $15,000 or whatever to spend on a car, I would buy a cherry bus, not a
new car.
