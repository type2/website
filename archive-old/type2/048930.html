Subject: [T2] Pictures of buses

About 2 years ago I started a website for our VW busclub in Holland. One of
the pages was a 'photo album'. This has grown into a large scale project
with pictures of well over a hundred buses (from split to Eurovan). The
captions are in Dutch but you'll figure it out.

So if all you can do today after eating too much turkey (and I hear in
Florida they are even eating ballots) is sit on chair and watch the screen
here is a nice collection of buses : http://www.vwbusclub.nl/Fotoboek.htm to
look at. You can even download a screensaver with most of the pictures.
