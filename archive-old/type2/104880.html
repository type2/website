Subject: Fiamma awning install help

I bought a Fiamma F35 awning for my 78 Westy. I am having a problem with 
the mounting brackets.
I can't get them to so they will clear the poptop when opening or 
closeing it. Plus the front bracket it to wide for the b-pillar.  That I 
can grind down. Anyonelse install one of these on their baybus?

Thanks,
