	I had installed an underdash bezel for the oil pressure, oil temperature and voltage gauges and was tired of mashing my knuckles into it every time I needed first gear (I've since moved the gauges to the dash under the stereo). I dropped $60 at JC Whipme's for the Empi shifter. It shifts fine but it doesn't play with the parking brake very nicely; to put it in neutral with the brake on I need to weasel the knob under the handle. In retrospect I wish I'd just gone for the $3.00 shift spacer. I've installed one of these in a bug with no trouble.
