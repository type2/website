Subject: RE: Spiral Bound your Bently's (or even better..)

Hey Folks,
  If the pages of your Bently's don't look like they would stand up to a 
spiral binding, think about going the hardcover route.  It's a much more 
permanent measure.   Wow, a 'forever bus' and a 'forever book'! 

Seriously, I am the 'bindery guru' here at Draughon Library, and we can 
bind any book under three inches in width for seven bucks.  While they're 
not quite as flexible as a spiral binding, the binding methods nowadays 
do allow for a book to lay open without the help of a greasy hand (or 
tool).  I've bound a few of my most beloved softcover books, and they 
look nice.  Heck, I even got my initials placed on the spine.     

If anyone is interested, drop me an e-mail.
