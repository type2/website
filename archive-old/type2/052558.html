Subject: [T2] Ohio listee w bus for sale!

Hey all!  Are we back yet??  A couple of weeks ago a listee in Worthington?? Ohio listed a 65 and a 67 bus for sale (marriage sale).  If you are out there, please let me know if you still have these.  I have some money in my pocket and my wife's permission to get another bus and any one of these could disappear at a moment's notice so I am very anxious to get into a pre-68 bus!


Peace, John Baker
