Subject: Re: [T2] tail light probs

Im not a big jiggling fan. I bought a bus with some scary wiring which
included an ammeter in the dash. I was lucky to put out the fire in the
foam part of the dash before anything bad happened.


&gt; Darn, I jus love these electrical short questions. It takes all day working
&gt; on a bus to trace one using a multimeter, trial and error etc. ... but long
&gt; distance diagnosis is easy ...
&gt;
&gt; The short under the dash may be related to the brakes. I would suggest
&gt; turning the headlights on and then jiggling the wires under the dash around
&gt; to see if the brake lights flicker. If they do try tracing the wire from the
&gt; headlight switch -- it should be black and white -- to the dimmer relay to
&gt; make certain it is clean.
