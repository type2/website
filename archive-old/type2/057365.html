Subject: '79 Engine in an '81

(warning, bus content involved.  Caution, Author is in a good mood)

Okay folks,
  Say I have a '79 2.0L Engine and I want to chuck it into a lonely
engineless '81, are there any significant modifications that will be
necessary? Can I use the '79 tin?  I'm not too sure about the awkward
transition from Baywindow to Vanagon and the potential changes in the 
engine compartment.  Info from web searches seem to point this out as a
do-able thing (which would be good for marital bliss, as I may live in the
doghouse for awhile if I bring home another fixer-upper that ain't quickly
fixed up)
