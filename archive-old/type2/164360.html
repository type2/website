-----Original Message-----
From: Abraham Palmer 
I'm located in Chicago/Milwaukee and in need of a rebuilt 2.0 L long block
engine. 


Like so many others before me I'm going to recommend Bob Donalds of Boston
Engine fame.
I purchased a 1600 from him which has been nothing but reliable.  When I
drove to his shop to pick it up he treated me like a long lost friend, not
just a customer.
