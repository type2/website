&gt; Yes, this is true. It is especially problematic if
&gt; you have the later
&gt; type with a PCV valve in it. I replaced mine with an
&gt; earlier model
&gt; that is the free flowing type. Even then, my
&gt; mechanic said the nipple
&gt; at the air cleaner was too contrictive, and that I
&gt; would experience
&gt; less oil leakage caused by crankcase pressure if I
&gt; would just take the
&gt; hose from the breather and hang it from somewhere up
&gt; high in the
&gt; engine compartment. This actually helped. In my case
&gt; it was mostly due
&gt; to blowby from a worn engine. Since yours is newly
&gt; rebuilt, you may
&gt; experience blowby until your engine is broken in.

thanks john and phil and list members

well after a short weekend i readjusted the timing and
 have bought some putty type jb weld.

and cleaned the oil breather now that was way overdue
...
when engine was rebuilt i didnt clean the oil breather
so why not now when trouble shows its self and reminds
me harshly of my neglect and slipping mind,.(grins)

well the timing was off by 7 degrees..
could it have changed that bad from the duals to the
weber....?
the timing was right when the duals were on and then
when i put the weber on it dropped that bad..?
was almost on TDC at running!

adjusted the idle and timing and she has power again
or did at least on saturday when i went to the grocery
store power again on start offs and gearing up
expecially where she didnt before so must of been
timing issue power wise?

there is still oil under the bottom of the bus same
place but not as much as was and thats what the putty
like jb weld is for.
i will take the fan back off and see if i can get back
in there again on that dipstick tube except this time
with putty so i can make sure i can reach and patch it
all hopefully if in deed thats where the oil is coming
from?
if not at least i will know for sure then that it isnt
for sure coming from there.

thanks you all keep you posted on the progress
throughout the week while out job hunting.
so now its down to stil a fairly nice oil leak? from
somewhere.
doesnt sem to be dropping the level now on the
dipstick though so hoping its mostly all runoff but
dont think so think that its still leaking a small
bit?
peace and love
chris
