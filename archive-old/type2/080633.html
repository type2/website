Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch slowly going- WHY?

I lost my clutch cable under similar conditions.  The cable did not break,
the connector on the pedal end wore through.  The hole had elongated quite a
bit prior to finally breaking, causing the clutch to inadequately disengage.

&gt; I've been having to push the clutch pedal lower and lower to the
&gt; floor for it to disengage. I have adjusted the cable twice now, and
&gt; it's good after that, but after a couple days, it's back to being
&gt; bad. This all happened after my accelerator cable broke while I was
&gt; downtown, so I had to use a rubber band to keep the carb open, about
&gt; 3k at idle. I was able to drive home, but I had to eat alot of
&gt; clutch. Then the clutch problems started. I originally thought that
&gt; it is my clutch wearing thin, but the more I think about it, it seems
&gt; like it's only the cable that needs replacing. It DOES NOT slip when
&gt; in gear, it's just hard to get it into gear and it feels like I need
&gt; to push the pedal farther than it can go to get the clutch to
&gt; disengage. Any thoughts?
&gt; Thanks
