Subject:  bus  buying question 

Hello all,

i'm new to the list and i have been reading about
everyone's adventures in restoration. well, i think i
have come upon an opportunity to get my very first
bus. it's a 68 and it doesn't have a title, engine,
tranny, or rear seats. but has a good front bumper,
nose, and  misc parts. it's being offered for a really
good price because of the missing stuff. i guess my
question are how much foes anyone estimate that it
would take for me to get this car up and running??
also, what does the no title mean for me as the
buyer?? any other suggestions/ advice will be greatly
appreciated. thanks.

Moonbreeze
