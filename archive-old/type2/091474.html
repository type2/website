Subject: Electrical checks

In the Bently for an air cooled Cal. Edition (Hall sender) it boldy
states (Pg 28.8) Do not connect any test instrument on terminal 15 (+) of
igniton coil, this could damage electronic parts.&quot;

Then 28.10 has resistance checks between terminals 1 + 15 (+ &amp; - ) on the
coil.  OK, well it says to disconnect all wires so it makes sense that
you would not damage any &quot;eceltronic&quot; items.  BUT then on page28.14, it
instructs yu to take a volt reading to terminal 15 with everthing hooked
up to the coil - what gives??  

Will I damage the said &quot;Electronic parts&quot; if I take the volt reading per
the hall control check on page 28.14 - is it OK since the idle stabilizer
is disconnected?

Please p-mail, I in lurking mode.
