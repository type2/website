Subject: mods, more mods, well essentially a tire question

http://www.drivetheplanet_dot_com/index.asp?Inc=Bus

i'm liking their rear facing, ambulance style seat. i'd like to fab that
for my 69 bus. in place of the cabinetry behind the seat as shown, i'd
rather stuff in the spare tire so as to remove it from the nose of the bus.
anyone know what is the smallest diameter that'll fit on a stock 14&quot; rim?
