Subject: Parts Interchangability question

Hi Folks,
    The back end of our '71 bus is a little saggy so I thought I would
adjust the torsion bars back there.  Then I got to thinking that I
don't know the history of the rear bearings and maybe I would change
them at the same time.  All of which leads me to this question, are
the spring plates, bearing housings, stub axle shafts, and hubs from a
'77 interchangeable with the same parts from our '71?    I have parts
from a 77 available that I thought I'd get all ready and then just
swap them over.  I'd love to hear from anyone with knowledge or
experience in this area.
