Subject: No Generator Light

I recently noticed my generator light has never came on (since I've owned
my bus).  Not even when I turn the ignition on.  I checked the wire &amp;
there's a good connection from the engine compartment to the dash.  The
regulator is putting out the correct voltage to the battery &amp; the
(generator) light works when I hook it up to a connection, other than the
regulator (like the + battery post).  So, I'm stumped.  The only thing I
can think is my regulator is faulty.  Has anybody had this sort of problem?
Should I get a new regulator?

thanks in advance,
