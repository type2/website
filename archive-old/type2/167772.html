Subject: Re: [T2] Removing engine with A/C, 1978 

Eric,

Yes, the bolts you mentioned ...Don't forget to take the belt off(if you 
still have one on).  Also, at that point you should be able to lift it up 
and to your left and set it on the sheet metal where a spare battery would 
go.

Don't forget to watch for the electirical connections!

A/C instructions on Richard's site.  www.ratwell_dot_com

Cheers, dave

&gt; Any pointers for removing an engine on a 1978 bus that has a big a/c
&gt; compressor on the left side?  It looks like I just take out the bolts on the
&gt; bottom of the bracket and the one on the side.That compressor looks heavy.
&gt; It has the under dash type of a/c with a blower on each side.  Is there
&gt; anywhere that you know of that has the installation instructions for these a/c
&gt; systems, it would be appreciated, which would include the belt size?
&gt;
&gt; Also any suggestions on which pistons and cylinder sets to avoid , in the 94mm
&gt; size, would be appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; Thanks
