&gt;  My problems are as follows:
&gt; 1 When I put the bus in reverse it dies?
the reverse light is powered in the engine compartment usually with a
fused lead from power(at the coil) thru the fuse thru the lamps and to the
switch in the tranny nosecone. sounds like a short there somewhere
&gt; 2 PO had oil and psi gauge installed and neither works. but the oil psi light 
&gt; works coming off a dbl sender
the other side of the dual sender feeds the pressure gauge G term
you didnt mention the type of temp sender there is

Gauges as follows
+12v to gauge (gauge has ground and lamp leads as well usually)
 sender lead to gauge. 
the lamp lead for the gauge can come from the dimmed power for the
instruments
