Subject: Re: sun roof leak

&lt;snip&gt;

My sunroof is leaking? Does anyone know if there is a seal 
that belongs on the outside of the bus.  Also, if I need to

adjust the sunroof can anyone tell me how to do that?  
Thanks Mike.

&lt;/snip&gt;


Mike,
The seals on a sunroof are not really &quot;seals&quot;. In other
words the material in there is designed to keep the wind
out  and large volumes of water... but it does allow water
in... the Germans put in a drip rail, so to speak, with
drains at all four corners of the sun roof. The two in the
back actually drip into the engine compartment. If you look
up in the vent area(s) you will see a pipe sticking out
waaay at the top. the front ones drain down the door
columns. I would advise check these drains to see if they
are stopped up. If you cant &quot;see&quot; if they are then find a
spot where you can park on a incline an run water on the
top... with the back higher then the front if it leaks then
your front drain(s) are plugged and vice versa. Use caution
when cleaning them. Use a fairly thin/stiff wire and drop
it down into the drains to see if they are clear...wont go?
then go a bit larger to clear the drains..... dont force
the wire as it is rumored that there is a tube in there you
can damage... I clean now and them from the bottom up. look
for the rubber grommet with about an 1/8&quot; hole in the
middle... this end can get plugged with crude coming up off
the road... the other end tends to get plugged with pine
needles an such from haven open whilst camping. My
experince has been that the front ones plug up more often
then the back ones.
