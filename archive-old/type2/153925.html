Subject: Re: [T2] Best Door Rubber (not way expensive though)

Mark said:)


 I am getting one of my vans completely redone body and inside.  I already
have new door rubbers, but I do not like them.  Here's why:
 
The rubbers on the doors now, has what appears to be an additional corner
molded in at the corners.  It looks like this design seals better than
what they econo rubbers that I have which have no corners.
 
I would like to get rubbers that have these corners molded in, and not the
the econo ones that are the same piece and mold of rubber all the way
around except for the area around the door limiter.
 
I have found new rubbers from no less than four vendors, and I am hoping
for some feedback as to the best that are still yet affordable.
 
 Do the Brazillian VW rubbers have the molded corners?  Or just the OEM
german ones (at VERY HIGH dollar too)(and besides, Brazil and Mexico is
where these busses have been produced in the last 20+ years, not Germany).
 
Anybody care to help and offer advice and guidance?
