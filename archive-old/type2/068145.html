&gt; &gt; In the next year or so I'll need to do some extensive travelling and I'm
&gt; &gt; curious to hear from list members if anyone has spent an extended time living
&gt; &gt; out of their bus.  I would imagine this is easier to do in a Westy but I'd
&gt; &gt; like to know of your experiences in any bus.  
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; How long did you live out of your bus?

Once four of us for two months travelling in Mexico.  Another time I lived
out of it for two months in Cambridge MA, the Blue Ridge Parkway and
Chapel Hill NC in february.

&gt; &gt; What camping equipment did you use?

My 66 camper had the fold out bed, fold-up table, seat behind drivers seat
facing backwards, and icebox with water spigot, no sink, behind passenger.
I used a single burner propane backpacking stove when alone, coleman white
gas other times.  Because I parked on city streets most of the time, I had
to practice stealth camping.  No lights after dark.  I have always written
and would put my typewriter (1974) on my lap and type away until time to
go to sleep.  I was glad there was no poptop because it was cold anyway.
My ceiling had insulation behind the woodgrain paneling.  

&gt; &gt; What about showers and calls of nature?

I peed in a bottle I'd put in a bag and empty in the gas station down on
the corner, where I'd wash and poop.  Urban camping is quite an
experience, especially when there is 18&quot; of snow on the ground.
