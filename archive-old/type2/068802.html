I  might have found a 72 bus as a daily driver round the corner in Cupertino,
Ca

What will happen if I retrofit a 1600cc 70 engine into a 72??
I really do not like the idea of a pancake engine and Clara says that the
72's were offered in the UK with the standard 1600 engine and the pancake as
an option.
