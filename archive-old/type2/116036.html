Subject: Re: [T2] westy sliding door handle

&gt; Is there a source for the interior sliding door handles? I was hauling a bunch
&gt; of kids around for a church thing a few months back and when one of them went
&gt; to open the door, it broke in half. I could drill for some pins and JB Weld it
&gt; together I guess, but I was wondering if new ones were around. From my
&gt; understanding, the Westy handle is different than the passenger bus handle

Same as a bus handle. Typically $20-30 or more new for a Genuine VW brazil
handle at the online vendors.  Everyone you'll find in the junkyard will
already have cracks.

CIP1_dot_com has a handle for $13 but I don't know anything about it.
