Subject: too hot heater fan

Problem solved...well, sort of.

Folks, I was reading the front page of the &quot;food&quot; section of the newspaper 
last week and they were doing an article on how convection ovens are 
really great for cooking faster.

Had a pic of the inside of the oven with...wait for it...a *fan* inside 
the oven, cause that's what it does.....move oven temperature air around 
without melting.

Bingo!  Might not be 5 billion cfm, but might help and certainly wouldn't 
melt from the temps our heaters put out.

Only one problem....finding one that runs on 12 volts.


Cheers, dave
