Subject: RE: [T2] '71 1600DP intake manifold

There was a time in California when drivers of certain vehicles were
required to retrofit smog devices.  Most of these retrofits took the form
of some sort of crude EGR system.  Our beetle came with the remnents of
one such system.  A hole was drilled in the heat riser and a special hose
nipple clamped on.  A hose went to some sort of mystery diaphragm valve
and thence to another hole cut in the top of the air cleaner.  The only
control of gas flow seemed to come from the valve and there was no
connection to manifold vacuum as in a conventional egr system.

Fortuntately, the smog czars quickly found out that the stock engine was
usually cleaner than the retrofit junk and the requirement to retrofit
went away.

&gt; This all sounds like a variation of what came with the 74 Beetle. 
&gt; The 74 Beetle (Federal) had an EGR system.  The muffler had an
&gt; additional tap that went to a external filter ($$$ to replace).  The
&gt; output of the filter went to a vacuum operated valve that was
&gt; connected to the manifold just below the carb.  Unless you lived in
&gt; California you probably got rid of the filter and went back to the
&gt; standard muffler when any of this stuff needed repair.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;my heat riser had a threaded hole in it. that's the way it came from 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;previous owner. it was a california vehicle.  for cali emissions, a 
&gt; &gt;tube
&gt; &gt;was installed from the riser to the manifold. actually, there was a 
&gt; &gt;nifty
&gt; &gt;gadget that was placed between the carb and the manifold to recieve 
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;tube neatly. if yours spent time in california, the thing that comes 
&gt; &gt;to my
&gt; &gt;mind is emissions.  - steve
