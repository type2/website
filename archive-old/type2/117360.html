Subject: Re: [T2] Sunroof idea's for 71 bus

&gt; I'm thinking of removing the pop-top of my 78 westfalia and instead
&gt; installing a sliding ragtop over the whole length of the pop-up hole (behind
&gt; drivers seat to the back). I saw this conversion once, and it was very
&gt; decent work. Must be great to sleep in the bus in summer with the whole roof
&gt; open to the stars... Unfortunately I could not talk to the owner to get some
&gt; information about this.

I had an older 1960 with the long canvas top that slide back

&gt; But I think there are some proplems to solve:
&gt; Is the bus still structural stable? For the ragtop to be curved like the
&gt; roof, there need to be some plastic/metal stripes sewed into the canvas.

my bus was still stable, yes there were metal frames sewn into the
material (still not real sure what it was made of, not pure canvas and not
plastic)

&gt; What about the front end of the ragtop? There should be some windshield and
&gt; a very strong connection bus&lt;-&gt;ragtop. What happens if you drive with both
&gt; front windows open (lots of air pressure in the bus), will the ragtop just
&gt; pop off?

the front of the sliding roof section was very ridged.  it did not come
all the way up to the windshield the front section of the bus was intact

never had any problems with the thing coming open although others said it
got a little like a balloon expanding if I went sort of fast (60mph was
fast)

&gt; Right now, this is just an interesting idea for me, but please feel free to
&gt; comment. And if the owner of the bus with the mentioned conversion is on the
&gt; list (british 76 ex-westfalia, color blue and white) please email me.

I'm sure mine is not what you are talking about but I have yet to see one
of these that didn't leak without a heck of a lot of work on em
