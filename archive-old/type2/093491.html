&gt;I read in the type 2 library ( http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/relay.html )that in

David,
That diagram that I put together showed how to use a fuel pump relay from a 
Rabbit or Audi as a safety circuit when installing an electric pump into a 
vehicle that used to have a mechanical pump.  In looking at the diagram for 
your year bus, the relays are quite different.  In your circuit, the signal 
from the points closing goes directly to the electronic control unit which 
in turn has a hand in the control of the fuel pump relay.

&gt;I'm looking at the wiring diagram for 76 model Westy's in the Bently
&gt;manual... but can't seem to find exactly where in the diagram you are
&gt;talking about...

In my Bentley, I am looking in diagram I page 5 of 5.  The double relay is 
marked J40 and it looks like the heavy black wire you are talking about is 
on terminal 86c of the relay


&gt;Now for the interesting part... just went out to my bus to trace those
&gt;wires...  Can't really tell if it's a red w/blue strip or red w/black
&gt;strip... (with a flashlight) the brown is definitely brown w/black strip,
&gt;both of these wires go out through the lower right corner of the firewall...
&gt;every wire in that group, (that's going through the hole in the firewall) is
&gt;butt connected ( I think that's what they're called... small tube, put one
&gt;wire in one end, one wire in the other end, crimp the wires in...)  SO if
&gt;they've all been replaced from the firewall on... what color they are
&gt;doesn't even matter right?  AND the black wire connected to that relay, goes
&gt;to the coil...

If you look at the diagram in the Bentley (diagram I page 5 of 5), the 
wires will be identified with color and wire size.

Now that we are in the neighborhood, I have a question for you.
This circuit that you have identified as causing the current drain, should 
NOT be hot with the key switch OFF.  Have you checked terminal 15 on your 
ignition switch to verify that it turns off when the key is off?  If the 
voltmeter says that it's still hot, then remove the wire from that terminal 
and test again.  If still hot, bad switch, if it goes cold, then you have 
an &quot;extra&quot; wire somewhere providing the feed.

[...]


Let me know what happens,

Scott
