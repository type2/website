&gt;These are EGR ports to the exhaust, and if they are still the original tubes,

&gt;can't go.

I think they could probably be welded from the inside, but the easiest way 
is to plug them like Dave said, or get different heads (what I did because 
plugs can fail, BTDT and I don't want it to happen 1,000 miles from home).
