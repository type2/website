Subject: RE: [T2] strange noise-78 Bus

&gt;It's coming from the rear and sounds EXACTLY like when  the rear
&gt;hatch is not closed tightly (not the case) - a loud  annoying rattling 
&gt;when I hit a bump. I had my wife drive while I climbed in the back - 
&gt;still couldn't isolate sound. This started about a month ago.

Check your rear shock mounting bolts (top and bottom).  Last Winter I had an 
odd thump that would come anytime I hit a bump or a sizeable crack in the 
road.  Drove me crazy for a couple of days.  I finally found the left rear 
lower shock mount bolt very loose.
