&gt;       I think a lot of us (myself for one and maybe you)
&gt; expected the Bus Boy's Catalog to be a big production full
&gt; of interesting bits for VWs, similar to the RMMW, West Coast
&gt; Metric or Wolfsburg West productions. Ain't so.

&gt; If you got something that lists their safaris and
&gt; lowered spindles, you've got the catalog, cos you can bet
&gt; there are NO specials on those items.

Not sure. I was talking to Jim once, and we were talking about him putting
his catalog on the web, and he allowed that it was a nightmare to even
think about because he had over a hundred megs of stuff including oodles
of pictures that constituted *stuff* for the catalog (if not *the* 
catalog, which may be entirely apocryphal ;). He also said that he had put
together the catalog for WCM (I think that was it) when he worked there,
before he started BusBoys. I think he knows exactly what we mean when we
say &quot;catalog&quot;.

The drop spindles might be in that flyer because they're high-markup or
&lt;retch&gt; high-demand? I do hope he isn't charging five dollars for six
photocopied pages! Maybe they are really in the catalog business and only
sell VW parts as loss leaders. ;) Just kidding.
