74-75 was rectangular, wood grain covered, and mounted to the wall. It
pivoted up and was supported by a round leg. It has a sliding extension leaf
under it.

&gt; I'm trying to determine if the table arm and mounting that is on my bus is
&gt; original or was taken from a new bus by the PO.
&gt;
&gt; I have one of those L-shaped arms bolted to the side of the sink unit.
The
&gt; table top isn't original (round w/ shelf paper...yuk!)

No, this is wrong.

&gt; Anyway, I was looking at this picture of the interior
&gt; (http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/westpics.htm)
&gt; and I was wondering, which table came with the deluxe westy.

The 74/75 table pictured is correct but I am not sure about that leg.....it
appears to be square.
