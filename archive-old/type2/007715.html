Subject: Chrome bumper rubber strip
Date: Sat, 14 Nov 1998 15:33:51 PST

I found a rear bumper from a Champagne edition [77]. The bumper wasn't 
in brand new condition but the rubber strip was so I got it [the 
rubber,NOT the bumper]. If I remember correctly Sami [sorry, I don't 
have your address since you moved to Canada] was looking for one about a 
year ago?? Also another listee wanted one....
In any case, whoever wants it for $10 + ups can have it.
