Subject: Re: [T2] VW ads site

Yep, know that one- lotta beetle stuff.  for busses, search on
&quot;bulli&quot;-stresses splitties.   I got a bunch of their postcards and a few
posters (ordered on line, had them delivered to my sister, picked  them
up in person).  Woulda visited them last July, but they are in
Handewitt, a fer piece to the northwest.  Westyfalia_at_aol_dot_com should be
able to get them in bulk for listees?  He's in Heidelberg.  Prices are
good, considering what they ask for such at VW shows.
