Subject: Re: Tires and rims (Bay / Vanagon)

&gt;My Riviera came with 215/70R14s on it, and needs five new ones. Any
&gt;recommendations at that size?

I ran that size (Michelin) briefly.  They are a little wide for the stock
rims, and I have only seen them in passenger tire ratings (never C or D).
Because of that, I wouldn't recommend them as ideal tires though they are
better than some.   Load ratings aside, I would go with a 205/75 instead of
215/70.
