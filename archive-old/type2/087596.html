Subject: Re: [T2] I have lights..THANKS STEVE!!!

&gt;All,
&gt;
&gt;I just wanted to post a big thanks to Steve Dolan who so graciously came
&gt;out to my place last night and hung out to fix my lack of brake lights and
&gt;turn signals problem. What a prince.
&gt;
&gt;I'm going to spend this evening cleaning up some corroded connections (we
&gt;found a lot of those) and getting her cleaned up for our first camping
&gt;trip together.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, thanks Steve!
&gt;
&gt;Melissa
&gt;71 westy
&gt;
Melissa:  Congratulations.  You are now a member of a growing club of
people that Steve Dolan has helped.

Several years ago, after spending a week trying to extract the ignition
lock from the steering column of my '71 Westy and burdening the list with
my saga,  Steve asked if I would mind having him pay a visit. Uh, no, not
at all, says I.

He arrived early in a weeknight evening and must have spent three hours in
my garage, bent into the shape of a pretzel,  teaching me the art of making
the special tool needed to push the plunger through the tiny hole in the
housing.

Had he not shown me in person, there is not a chance in a million that I
would have found that hole by myself.

What a prince, indeed!!!

Regards, Jack
