I'd recommend a 68 or 69 for simplicity, inexpensive parts that apply in the 
case of the 
upright engine. Nice Single port motor with a simple carb.

But my overall recommendation would be the 77, Nice strong 2.0 liter engine, 
hopefully 
with intact fuel injection, good power, smooth ride, and a solid valve train 
system, which
I prefer over hydraulics.
