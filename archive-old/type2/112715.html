&gt;
&gt; The 71 body used by westfalia is a sunroof bus. But to convert this to
&gt; an operational sunroof would require a sunroof, cabling, drains, and
&gt; the sunroof drive mechanism. These parts will probably be difficult to
&gt; acquire and install..

Since that first is a true statement I would have to assume the drains are already installed as
they are an integral part of the body.
