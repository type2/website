&gt; Hiya Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; With the pronounced knock on right hand turns at low speeds it is most likely 
&gt; that your CV joints need attention.  This was my situation just a couple of 
&gt; weeks ago.  Same exact symptoms.  It turned out that all four of my CV joints 
&gt; were shot.  It is a fairly easy replacement which runs about $45 a joint if 
&gt; you have to replace or $5 a joint if you only have to service (regrease and a 
&gt; new boot).  An excellent tech article on servicing CV joints can be found in 
&gt; the Type2 Library.

All four?!  That would be a very rare occurance, seeing as how typical CV
life can vary from 50K to what seems like infinity.  CVs usually fail from
contamination in my experience.
