Hmmm, there's a few spots in California that might
also be in the running:

1) Berkeley (cliche but true)
2) Venice (see above)
3) Joshua Tree on any given day - majority Vanagons
4) Highway 1/Central Coast - mostly Vanagons

My little artsy/hipster-cum-yuppie :-( neighborhood in
Echo Park (LA) has about 8 busses within a several
block area.  There are some common personality factors
that draw people to these areas, I think, that while
not causal, at least seem to correlate.  Factors such
as love for road travel, remnants of (or perhaps an
evolved) beat or hippie outlook (though obviously not
everyone), art, camping/outdoors, etc. 

Just some fun speculation on a Friday, ur, Saturday.

&gt;I drove my bus down to Ocean Beach in San Diego to
&gt;join some buddies 
&gt;for
&gt;beer this evening. The bus was definitely at home
&gt;down there...they 
&gt;must
&gt;have the highest per capita bus concentration in the
&gt;world! At least 
&gt;two on
&gt;every block...but lots of rust.
