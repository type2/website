Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal question.

I not only claim to have done it, it is the only way I have EVER removed a
T-4 from a bus, probably a half a dozen times all told. The most recent was
a year ago when I installed the new AVP engine in my 74.  I'm not saying
it's easy or anything like that, but it can be done in a reasonable amount
of time on a gravel driveway with only ordinary tools and equipment.

That being said, next time I will be lowering the tranny to make it easier.
(I never said I LIKED doing it with the tranny in place.)

Regards,
Dave

&gt; Yes!!  I've always wondered how some people can claim they removed/
&gt; installed their type4 engine with the tranny in place and fan housing
&gt; attached.  I've NEVER been able to do that.  Back before I started
&gt; dropping engine/tranny together, I used to install the engine as
&gt; a long block (with cylinder covers, minus rear tin, fan housing,
&gt; alternator, exhaust, etc.) to get the clearance I needed.  Even then
&gt; it was a struggle.
