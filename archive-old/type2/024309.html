&gt;  Is this the only way to correct my problem? 

I pulled the firewall out of my 74 &amp; replaced the sender. It wasn't the worst automotive experience I've had. When I inspected my old sender I saw why it wasn't looking. There are a series of parallel contacts that the sensor slides over as the float rises and falls. About half of the contacts were worn completely away.

My notes aren't in the archives yet, so here's my experience:

#1) As mentioned earlier, watch for two sheet metal screws accessible under the bus that hold the lower part of the firewall in place.

#2) With all of the screws removed, pry the firewall out from the bottom. Once it clears the engine tin (a squeeze &amp; bend operation), you can free the top of the firewall by applying downward pressure with a tire iron or pry bar. There's a 1/4'' lip that goes straight up into a slot.

#3) It's a pretty tight maneuver to remove the old sender, but I did it with the tank in place. I removed the tank to put the new one in...but wouldn't necessarily recommend that. (Be careful loosening the hold-downs if you do. They're mild steel &amp; break easily.)

#4) Reinstalling the firewall was pretty simple. The hardest part is getting the bottom to clear the tin. I used several wide-blade taping knives, wedged between the frame &amp; the tin and the firewall slipped right over them.


&gt; I think the vent hose(s) are leaking.  

Or the filler hose. I don't think you can access any of this stuff *without* pulling the firewall. There's some good info in the archives on faking a filler hose (no longer available--well,not for a 74. Check with Bus Depot, I think they have 75-79 or something.)
