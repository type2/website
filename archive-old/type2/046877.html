Subject: [T2] I give up -- '78 Champagne edition for sale - $1000.

Volks,

Well, it is like this.  If you look at the signature block, you will see
that I am up to four buses.  Now there are those that would say that this
is more than any sane person needs.  I am not sure this is true (I am also
not so sure of my sanity :-), but I know that it is more than *I* need.

This bus is the bus that Mark Kaylor bought and had some vacuum trouble
with.  Eventually he got it running, went on a ride around the block, it
died, and he gave up.  I bought it from him.  After diagnosing the
problem, which took three trips from Virginia to Lancaster, PA (dead
battery) I got it running.  The next step would be to find and fix the oil
leaks, replace the fuel lines, replace the muffler, drive it back to
Virginia, get it past safety and emissions here in Virginia and start
driving it.  What I have forgotten is that on unknown buses, the &quot;breaking
in&quot; process generally take me about 6 months to a year and involves twice
as many repairs as I anticipated :-)

Now, at the moment, my priority is getting the '67 down to Kelly for metal
work.  I just finally got the engine running today, still have to figure
out what is wrong with the clutch and install a temporary plate to hold
the hinge of the gas pedal (the front floor in the '67 is truly a poster
child for oxidation :-( Sooo.....

I don't have time, I don't have energy, and I don't have the money to give
this bus what it deserves.  It is a good restorable bus, It is a Champgne
Edition, and I believe it could be a nice runner.  I also believe it will
take more than a bit of fiddly work and a fair amount of rust repair to
get in really nice shape.

I want out.  I want someone who has more time and energy than I to take
this on.  It is a good bus and deserves a good home.  Most of all, having
bought it from Mark for $500 and expended another $200 getting it running 
(you would think that charging a battery would cost less... you would be
*wrong*! :-), and wanting *something* for my time and trips to Lancaster,
I want $1000 for this bus.

The good:

Champagne Edition 1978 Passenger bus;
135K miles;
compressions are good (even and 120 psi, per Mark);
upholstery is in good condition (pads are toast);
Engine starts and runs;
straight body;
ignition has been tuned up *very* recently :-)

The bad:
Rocker and dogleg rust in typical amounts for the East Coast;
muffler is toast (one-piece replacent);
needs new brake booster (good used unit included in price of purchase);
needs drivers door handle replaced (gad, this was annoying!)
There are some oil leaks (pushrod tube seals, I think).

Asking: $1000. Offers below $700 will be ignored.

Let me know if you are interested.
