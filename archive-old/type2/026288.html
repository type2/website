This is my first posting to this message board, and after reading the very
scarey instructions about what to post and what not to, I've been waiting
for something I thought I might be able to contribute on.

I had a problem similiar to this, atlthough I think mine was just that my
flywheel was &quot;sticking&quot;. Sometimes (I figured out it was when I killed the
engine and didn't leave the clutch in till the verrrrryyyyyy last engine
revolution) I would hop in my 76 and it would just click a little.
Everything appeared just peachy, electricaly and otherwise. My fix was (this
worked several dozen times) was to open the door, put it in reverse, place
my right foot on the clutch, and I would hop backwards pushing the bus with
my left foot on the ashpalt. Once I had enough juice, I would pop the
clutch, and let the engine make one revolution. 

Now that I think about it, it worked when I did it in first as well. My
reason for reverse was that I had heard that reverse is a lower gear than
first, so from a pushing prospective it's easier to get it to turn the
engine.

So yeah....


Eric

Hopefully you have your ignition wire (terminal 15) hooked up to your coil
and not the starter. Terminal 30 (fat and Red) is always hot at the starter,
while solenoid terminal 50 is switched hot (Red/White) from the
ignition/starter switch. (In other words I'm just teasin' you about your
having ignition going to a place it doesn't go).  Have any of the starters
you've put in been genuine new Bosch rebuilts?  Could 5 *used* starters be
the problem? What shape is the starter bushing in?  If you jumper terminal
30 via starter or battery to terminal 50 (solenoid) and the starter doesn't
work, she most likely be a baaaaaad starter.  Quit messin' with crappy used
starters and get a genuine Bosch rebuilt...which in many cases is brand new
stuff.  I have seen a bad fuel pump dump so much fuel into an engine it
wouldn't crank, but not on a 78 Westy ;-)

OK.

After work, in the parking lot, the starter/solenoid would NOT kick over.

I ran a wire from the battery, outside, to the ignition wire spade on the
solenoid (I took the ignition wire off the solenoid).

Nothing...

I put a voltmeter in line with wire, from the battery to the ignition wire
spade on the solenoid.  The wire actually was a remote starter switch, from
the battery to the volt meter, and the volt meter to the ignition wire spade
on the solenoid.  I could push the remote starter button and watch the volt
meter (digital)
