Subject: re: espar manual

In response to someones post about calling Espar in order to get information
about the BN4 heater, I was told that they no longer have any information to
give out and have never actually sold the BN4 heater to begin with.  This
was the Canadian number which I called so I'm not too sure what is going on
here.  By the way they also asked if I was referred to them through VW or
how did I manage to get their number.

For a free manual covering the later model BN4 (has a metering inline fuel
pump and plastic cover over the electricals) call Espar (Eberspacher's
operating name North America) and ask for a manual--they send them out
gratis.   You'll get 3 manuals: technical, installation, parts.  Their
number is: 1-800-387-4800 (calling from the U.S.).  If you're calling from
Canada it's 1-800-668-5676).

They no longer sell parts for the BN4 heater, nor do they have manuals for
the BA6 (and probably not the BN2 either--not 100% sure about that one though).

Good luck,
