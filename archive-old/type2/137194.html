&gt;David,

&gt;I've never heard of a satisfied Maaco paint customer: when I researched paint,
&gt;everyone who had anything to say about Maaco said stay away.  (Of course, if
&gt;there are any satisfied Maaco customers here, you should say something now!)

You have now.  I had a ' 72 Ford 3/4 ton pick-em-up painted by the Maaco 
in El Cajon, CA 20 years ago.  Paid something over $300 for their 
&quot;deluxe&quot; job. (Cheap price was $69.95 at the time.) Minimal bodywork 
done.  Truck still looks great.  Maaco did all right by me.  If it had 
lasted five years it would have been fine.  Here it is twenty years 
later, it's spend the majority of its life uncovered and it still looks 
like a nice stock paint job.  (Pics available should you desire.)
