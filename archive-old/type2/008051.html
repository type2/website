	When I rebuilt my amp, a couple of years ago, I ended up with  a lot of
excess closed cell foam.  When I got my bus I noticed the same problem
with noise, so I laid down the closed cell foam under the floor mats and
ever since I've noticed a great amount of noise reduction, and it hardly
cost me anything!  I got the foam at my local music store for a couple of
bucks for a nice sized sheet (this was a couple of years ago, so I don't
remember any exact prices, or sizes) and it has worked fairly well, both
in the van and in the amp.
