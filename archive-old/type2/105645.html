Subject: Leaky CV boot

Hi volks,

One of my inner cv boots is leaking grease between the boot and the shaft. It looks like it oozes out and then gets &quot;flung&quot; around the underside. The boot is in very good shape, so it just seems like it is not snug enough around the shaft. I read in Bently that these later type boots do not use hose clamps like the ones earlier. Has anyone had this problem before? Does anyone see a reason not to put a hose clamp on?

Thanks for the input!
