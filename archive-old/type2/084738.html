I think 71 and 72 are the same.  Sounds like the hose might be plugged.

&gt;To the list,
&gt;
&gt;Just drop off my 71 Westy the right front brake is pulling and locking up.
&gt;He had swooped the caliper from my 72 that had been work good with no
&gt;pulling. The master cylinder and hose have been replaced.
&gt;
&gt;Chris,
&gt; &gt;From what I have been told 71 is one year only calipers.  72 should not
&gt;work.. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.
