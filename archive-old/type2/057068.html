Subject: THANKS!

Thanks everyone for the words of encouragement and help in finding the
shifting information I was looking for.  I had a great time figuring out
the stick shift, and learning to drive Gretel (my brown/white '77 Campmobile)
to (and up) Mt Hebo in Tillamook county, Oregon.  The foam seals that complete
the engine seal (between the frame and the tin) were missing and I couldn't
get any on short notice so I took lots of breaks to make sure the engine wasn't
overheating.  One question I had: I've heard mention of 'the dipstick test'..
at no point was the TOP (the circle part) of the dipstick 'too hot to touch'
but the actual oil was on numerous occassions.  What exactly IS the 'dipstick
test' and how do you perform it?   The only problems I detected from Gretel
were some whitish/blue smoke from the fan and right of the fan when I reached
the summit of the mountain (and a very small amount of the same when I came
back down off the mountain) and a small sortof well.. 'puttering' noise when
going downhill and not pressing the accelerator.  Other than that she seems to
like me just fine and we're getting alone well :)  I plan to have her in for
a tuneup, as well as getting the engine compartment sealed up nice and tight.

Again, thanks to everyone who mailed me helping me out, it's a good feeling
to be a part of the VW bus community.  I got waved at 6 times this weekend, 
and made a friend up on the mountain!  Keep up the good work!
