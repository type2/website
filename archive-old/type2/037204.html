Subject: towing in Boston area

Boston listees: 

If in need of towing on 128 or 495, these guys are really pretty good.

   Interstate Wrecker Service, Inc.
   2740 Washingotn Street
   Canton, Mass 02021
   781-326-3400

That address is on 138 North 200 yards from 128/93 -- the first
exit on 128E/93N from where 93N and 95N split (95N doing that
270 degree right turn onto 128 known as Dead Mans Curve)

They are what you get if the State Police call you a tow and
are open 24x7.  AAA accepted, naturally.
