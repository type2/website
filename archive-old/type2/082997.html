Subject: Re: [T2] Sacrilidge, Subaru Ea-81 into 78 VW Bus

Hey Karl,

Thanks for the reply.  I originally wrote this for my
subaru forum, hence the dodging of the real isuue. 
Which is the impending head job, lack of power,
obsolete motor, propensity for overheating, dropped
valves, etc.

I have had to repair solder joints in the ECU already
too. and my air sensor is gonna go any day.

I know e-81's; they are bulletproof, easy to work on,
strong, and all around a good motor.  And, I have
plenty as I have been an older subaru freak for
several years.

Oh Yeah, they also use ea-81's in experimental
aircraft, you won't see our beloved type 4 in those.

The Kennedy adpator is about $500, and radiator
routing hoses will put me back another $150.  A custom
radiator (to fit in a fake spare tire looking thing)
would set me back about $500 too.  I am sure there are
several other incidentals, but worth it in my opinion.

Thanks and Kindest Regards,

Mark

&gt; &gt; OK, I am ready for the flack, bring it on :)  I am
&gt; &gt; seriously thinking about putting an Ea-81 into my
&gt; 78
&gt; &gt; van as I am tired of the analog computer always
&gt; &gt; fubaring the fuel injection in it.
&gt; 
&gt; Please explain, I have found the fuel computer to be
&gt; almost bullet proof. 99%
&gt; of any failure I have seen has been because water
&gt; got in them, usually after
&gt; someone thought they were doing a good thing by
&gt; having their engine
&gt; compartment steam cleaned.
&gt; The other 1% failure was on my 77 Westy. I developed
&gt; a cold running problem
&gt; that had me buffaloed for over 3 months. If I
&gt; started the bus on a cold
&gt; morning and immediately took off, I had lack of
&gt; power and no acceleration for
&gt; about 2 blocks, then it ran normal. If I let it warm
&gt; up for 5 minutes, it ran
&gt; normal. Tested and retested everything. Nothing out
&gt; of spec or out of range.
&gt; Finally, on a SWAG*, I put another ECU in it. That
&gt; corrected the cold running
&gt; problem. The bus never showed any other symptoms,
&gt; ran the same warm with
&gt; either ECU.
&gt; If you are having a high failure rate of ECU's, you
&gt; either have something else
&gt; taking them out or a ground problem.
&gt; 
&gt; * Scientific Wild Ass Guess
