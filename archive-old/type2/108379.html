Subject: Re: [T2] Children in a T2 camper ?

Oscar,

    You said......&quot;Darren (or anyone), can you mail me a few pics of
the inside of a T2 ? I see a lot of pics on the web, but I'm not sure
what an 'original' camper has to look like.&quot;....................

    How many beds and the interior set up of a VW camper will depend
on which company converted the bus to a camper.  Here in the USA there
was more than one company and I bet the same is true there in Europe
too.  Best to find someone who is familiar with the European campers.
