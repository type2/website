Usually it's the opposite problem...

&gt;The far right port had no black &quot;soot&quot; in it like the
&gt;other three ports did.
&gt;
&gt;Is this indicative of a bad mixture? or not firing at
&gt;all?

It could be too lean (that pipe could be really really hot as a result). You could verify where the cylinder if firing by pulling the plug with and detecting any major change in RPM (no change, no fire in that cylinder).

&gt;Which cylinder is that far right port for? The #1 or
&gt;the #2?

#1.

&gt;Can this be a clue to what's going on? I was about to
&gt;get a new carb, but maybe something's going on in the
&gt;engine/head?

Agreed.
