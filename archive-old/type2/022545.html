Hey folks,
    Well, no pictures this weekend since I gave AOL the boot and switched
to EarthLink. Anyway, I finished stripping the Westy yesterday, EVERYTHING
but the drivers seat has been removed. It has no glass, no door seals, no
doors! It is just shell at this point. Once I peeled up what was left of
the seat stand rubber I applied adhesive remover to remove the foam padding
that is quite securely glued to the base. I left it too long and it even
removed the paint as well! Next I have to use the adhesive remover to get
the weatherstrip cement out of the channels where the seals go-yeah, I am
going a little crazy here. I couldn't resist mixing up a little paint and
spraying a small section of the interior. After sanding and cleaning the
area with Prep Sol, I painted a small section in the right rear of the
interior-it looks great. The color I choose is Lapis Blue, a Chrysler-Jeep
color. I remember a couple of years ago looking at the web pages of a guy
on the list ( Fly Boy) and his pictures of his Westy stripped down to be
painted just like mine is now and thinking &quot;this guy is nuts!&quot; Well, here I
am doing the same thing. &lt;sigh&gt; Hopefully it will be worth it in the long
run.    Jeff S.
