&gt;all 914s were FI engines..

Except for the 914-6, which had two triple Weber carburetors.
The FI 914 has the casting mark for the mechanical fuel pump,
but it is vestigial, as in not used; it is also found on later bus cases.

&gt;&gt;If you have a 914 engine case,
&gt;&gt; there will be a vertical dipstick at the breather box,
&gt;&gt; the casting for the bus oil filler tube will be casted
&gt;&gt; but not opened, as well as the location for a mechanical
&gt;&gt; fuel pump ( carb engine ).
