Subject: Exhaust studs 8x9mm and 8x10mm

Hello List,

For a while now I've been getting a popping noise from my dual Weber 
34ICT carbs on acceleration. I figured this was a result of the heater 
boxes not sealing up to the engine and boy was I right. When I got under 
there there were 2 exhaust studs missing off the heads, one on #3, one 
on #1. Some of the others were *very* loose.

I know german supply sells the 8x9mm studs for like 8 bucks or so. kinda 
pricey for a stud..  I know some of  mine are already tapped to 10mm, 
I'll find out which ones when I tear the things off this weekend. Where 
can I get 8x10mm stepped studs? I was thinking of making my own by 
cutting up some 10mm 1600cc head studs or lower engine/tranny studs and 
welding them to  cut  8mm exhaust studs to create a 8x10. Anyone tried 
this?  How hard is it to go with helicoils in this instance?... and how 
well will they work? I fear that some of the 10mm threads might be crap 
and helicoils will be the only option. Looking at a head on the bench 
anything bigger than 10mm doesn't look like a good idea... whoever did 
those heads did a terrible job on the exhaust studs. I'm really hoping I 
can get in there and take care of this without having to pull the heads off.

I would greatly appreciate any advice.

thanks,
Eddie
