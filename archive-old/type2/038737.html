Subject: Re: Distributors

I'm running an 1800 (1776 with 1 mm offset grind on crank); Elgin 6408-18 
cam; 7.5:1 compression; bug pack single muffler exhaust; 34 PICT 3 with 145 
main jet; a little head work and the stock duel vacuum distributor in my '71 
Westie.  I'm getting fantastic bottom end power and superb drivability.  I 
can't tell you about top end yet as I only have 400 Mi's. on it so far. You 
failed to mention whether you have a counter weighed crank or what your 
compression ratio is.  Right off I would suggest using the stock distr. 
(single vacuum I believe) set it up with 22-25 degrees total advance.  The 
reason I'd use the stock distr. is to get the fast advance that you get with 
a vacuum distr.  A word of warning witch I probably don't need to give you 
but here goes. If your not running a counter weighted crank I'd limit RPM to 
4K.
