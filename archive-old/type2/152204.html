&gt; While completing the trip (the last 45 miles of a 300 mile round trip)
&gt; in a rollback truck, Jamie and I sat in the back of Lurch watching
&gt; where we had been through the windshield while playing Backgammon.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for hanging in so far.  What to do?
&gt;
&gt; Option 1:  buy a complete new engine (about $2500)
&gt;
&gt; Option 2:  buy a new long block only (about $1500) (everything I have
&gt; top-end wise is in pretty good shape)
&gt;
&gt; Option 3:  get yet another rebuild with a spare case I have in my
&gt; garage (about $1000) (I figured with the oil leak, I have a hole in the
&gt; case)
&gt;
&gt; Lurch is my daily driver and I don't have the luxury of time.
&gt;
&gt; This engine lasted about 40,000 miles, so I REALLY don't want go back
&gt; to the same rebuilder.

option 4:  try to find a Mexican new engine......

time is money, maybe the $2,500 option is the best. IF you have the money
and don't have the time.

you have my condolences....

Bob
