Subject: Re: timing, wrong year engine

&gt; So what I am trying to figure out now is what is the CORRECT timing.
&gt; Do I time it as 7.5o BTDC or 5 ATDC for california???
&gt; Or time it as a 78 engine acording to muir's which is 7.5o BTDC

Set it according to the dist you have WITH a timing light.

If you have a single vacuum unit: set it at 7.5 Before at idle.

If you have a dual vacuum unit AND you have vacuum at idle connected to the
inboard nipple: set it at 5 After at idle.
If you do not have vacuum, for whatever reason, set it to 7.5 before. When
you do get vacuum to it, it will go to 5 after. [you can verify this by
disconnecting a working retard vacuum line and the timing will go from 5
after to 7.5 before]
