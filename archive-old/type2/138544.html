Subject: Semi-Metallic front pads from bus-boys

Anyone uses these ? I'd like to get opinions.
211-698-151FM Bus/Pickup 71-72 (Semi-Metallic)  $40.00 set

Is the almost 2.5 X price increase worth it compared to these ? Is a set 
four or two pads ? I want 4 of course...
211-698-151F Bus/Pickup 71-72 (Organic)  $15.00 set

I never got semi-metallic on my motorcycle because i've been told that they 
always squeak and wear the disc way faster. Is that also true in the 
enchanted bus world ?

My bus brake update:
Front right caliper is shot and gets out of the way: the outer piston is 
definitely stuck in there. The part that received the upper retainer pin 
broke off. Right pads are totally shot. Left ones look OK. Brake hoses are 
cracked.

I'm debating wether I want to buy a rebuilt caliper or get one at the 
junkyard and rebuild it.
