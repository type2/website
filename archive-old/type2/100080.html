&gt; Could the list memeber who posted the part number for the throttle body seal
&gt; send it to me again?  I've had a hard disk wipeout and lost the information.

Here it is:

&gt;Hi All:
&gt;
&gt;I found and ordered the seal for the throttle body. ETKA had the part
&gt;number listed. It is 022-133-069. VW still stocked the item, though I am
&gt;not sure for how long. Ouch it was $6.27. Anybody know if this is
&gt;available out of the VW system?

Some more info I collected...

ETKA location:

&gt; The Maingroup (for the 82 Vanagon) is 1, subgroup 33, Illustration 26-00.

What the part does:

&gt; This seals the butterfly valve shaft for the throttle on the throttle body.
&gt; The seal
&gt; becomes very brittle with age. Mine was leaking about 1 inHg. After I knew
&gt; what I was
&gt; listening for, I could hear the air whistle into the opening through here.
