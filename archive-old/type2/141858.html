Subject: VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon 

I have my A/C sitting in my Utility Room waiting for me to do the necessary
repairs to the Window Frames and then getting a new Headliner installed.
Then I can start installing the A/C.  In looking at the installation
pictures on http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/78busac/, I do have a few
questions.  I assume that a Sanden SD508 was used?  If so, what adapter did
you get for the hoses?

I have another problem with my Bus that I was planning on fixing later, but
it has been moved up because the condenser straddles the middle of the Bus.
The Heat Transfer Tube from the back to the front has some rust through
places in it.  I have not been able to find a replacement for this.  The
tube for the earlier Buses is too small.  I have a 1972, built in Feb. of
'72.  If no one has this, I plan to cut the old one out and try to locate a
suitable replacement at a muffler shop or maybe an electrical shop that has
large conduit.
