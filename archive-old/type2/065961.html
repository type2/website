Subject: Floor replacement question

This winter will be the time to replace the front floor of the crew cab.  To
all of you who have replaced the front floor, how hard is it to get out?  I
assume the steering column, parking brake, shifter, and all pedals need to
be removed.  How many welds need to be broken?

I also have a nose dent by the floor that needs to be pounded out - would it
be better to do this with the floor out or in?

And one more simple question - what's a &quot;dogleg&quot;?  Is it the inner fender
piece that the '68-'72 bumper step is bolted to?

Thanks,
Dean
