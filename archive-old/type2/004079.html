&gt;That means lost power.


My mechanic deliberately adjusted my cable/linkage so that I would not over
exert my engine (after he had repaired it). He had it set for 80% travel
which left me a little short of 'get up and go' when I was preparing myself
(and von Kermit) for some serious hills.

Didn't work, though. Engine still collapsed! About to go for rebuild # 3.
