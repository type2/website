Subject: Numbers on Carb and Dizzy
Message-ID: &lt;3703b36fNumbers on Carb and Dizzy*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt;These are the numbers on the distributor 0 231 178 009  9 52 

This sounds like an '009' distributor.


&gt;These are the numbers on the carb, its a two barrel Weber. 32 360 FA 23A SL 
&gt;Have no idea on the carb, those are the only numbers I could find. Thanks 
for any help.

This sounds like a 2 barrel weber. 

I don't know what size engine you have, but I've been sucessful timing a type 
4 motor (1700) with a two barrel holley in conjunction
with an 009, by timing the motor to about 6 degrees BTDC (at idle), then test 
riding it for smoothness until I find an amount of degrees
between 5 and 10 btdc that feels best. Before locking in the timing, you must 
check the total advance to make sure the timing
is not too advanced, which can be done with a good advance timing gun with 
adjustable knob. Also engine pinging under load at
highway speeds a a good indication the total advance is too high, I think the 
limit is about 32 degrees at 3,000 rpm. good luck.
