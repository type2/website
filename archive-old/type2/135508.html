&gt;Not entirely, at 100,000km VW usta give out free medallions...

And they stopped giving them out when the car proved too sturdy and too many people were claiming them. Both are nice bits of trivia but it doesn't mean their marketing department wanted you to drive your car forever.

They expected you to buy a new VW rather than supply PCV valves for 20-50 years after production ended.
