I've been having problems for a long time now, where belts that are
supposedly the right size require all the shims be out to be anywhere
close to tight enough.  A little stretch later, and they're too big.
It could be that I have a 6 volt pulley on the generator, and a 12
volt pulley on the crankshaft.  Would this be likely to cause such a
problem?  What are the sizes of the four pulleys involved?

Thanks.
