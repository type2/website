Subject: mark this...torsion tweakers

&gt; please, please, please, please.....mark the torsion arms with a cold chisel.
&gt; this way you can re-assemble them in a relatively short period of time. 
&gt; otherwise you will be real good with a protractor and ruler after you are
***
i'm going to have to go the blessed route.
the only parts i saw instruction to mark were parts that 
weren't going back on.  I&quot;m swapping suspension from '71 to '68.

the trial and error methode insists on installing/removing/installing/
removing the hub et cetera? this is bypassed by the elusive Torsion
Arm Adjustment Tool, or perhaps the cool looking protractor tool with
the pearl pistol grip? any other sugesstions from the list gurus?
how about a location on the body/frame to use as measurement referance?
like 3&quot; from top of arm to stop, or 12&quot; to top shock bolt hole...yah.

i digress,
please let me know what tool i should purchase or which methode i should
use. what did they use at the factory? a big burly german who knew the 
angle of the dangle by heart no doubt.

i still have to take the susupension out of the '71, but it wont stop 
raining... way to wet out there. so... back to the garage, under the '68 to
diesel toothbrush the rear underbelly. then detergent scrub and drying 
[dirt floor except scrap linoleum, carpet, conveyor belt, and old moldy
interior panels]. while it's drying i'll pull the '71 parts and clean/prep.

whew, now all i have  to do is wait for my work pants to dry...
