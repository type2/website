Hi Thomas,

If your bus has the on-board VW diagnostic plug, the brown(tan)/green stripe wire
goes to the negative (Terminal 1) of the coil to provide a tach signal to VW's
diagnostic computer.  I have removed all of the wires which were part of the
diagnostic system in the quest for simplification.  I don't have the computer and I
won't go to the dealer.  No problems encountered.  Brown is generally a ground wire
in German vehicles, try to trace the loom back and find the other end.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt; &gt; a brown wire with a green stripe (not connected),
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; any ideas as to what the other two wires should attach to?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks,
&gt; &gt;         t
