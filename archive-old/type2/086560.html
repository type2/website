Subject: Re: [T2] battery/city power?

In addition to replacing that hidden fuse, if that does not solve the
problem, the fuse holder might not be fitting as tight as it should. I had
the same problem and replaced the fuse and it would work for a while and
then quit, only the fuse wasn't blown but appeared to have melted. I then
discovered the intermittent nature of the fuse holder. If I continue to have
problems I am going to put an inline fuse holder in to replace the clip.

Subject: [T2] battery/city power?


I took Elvis out for 'our' shakedown camping cruise this past weekend and
had a little problem with the city power (I think). The fridge would work
when on battery power but would not on city power. However, the receptacle
below the rear seat did work fine as I ran a portable electric heater all
night long. Kind of a bummer to not be able to use the fridge though. I put
a new auxilliary battery in before I left and I was wondering if maybe I did
something wrong? Another thing, how do I fill the water tank? Is it through
that pvc thing next to the sink or do I hook a hose up to the outside?
Thanks,
Richard
