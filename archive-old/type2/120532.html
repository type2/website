Subject: Friday-Actually there IS such a thing as a cheap bus

I guess i am one of the lucky ones, here's my story:
bought my first bus in 1998, a 75 Riviera for $1500
put a Maaco paint job on for $300 and drove it for 2
years without putting any other money into it. After
driving for 2 years, sold it for $2500.
Took $1100 of that $2500 and bought a 66 camper, put
another $1000 into it just on interior and cosmetic
stuff.  After driving it for less than a year, I
decided I missed the &quot;luxuries&quot; of bay window driving
and traded it even for my current 71 westy.  In the
past 2 years I have travelled all over the eastern
U.S. in the 71, and other than routine maintenace
stuff, I haven't had to put any additional $$ into it.
(i did buy a new carb, mistakenly thought the carb was
bad, turned out to be a clogged fuel breather line)
So final cost for my Very solid, dependable 71 westy
follows:
Intitial $1800 expense for first bus, then add icome
of $2500 I got for selling it.  Subtract the $1100
plus the $1000 I spent on the 66, which I traded even
for the 71, and I have spent approximately $1400 on
having a daily driver bus for the past 6 years! Not
bad, eh?!
