Subject: Safare Poptop camper

This is my first attempt at posting to this list so I hope it works.
I have the opprotunity to buy, very cheaply, a 1974 bus that was 
converted to a poptop camper by Safare in Hayward, Ca. I searched the 
archives but can't find anything on a poptop Safare camper. The back 2/3 
of the top pops straight up and has four tent sides with windows on 
three sides. There's a full size bed up there and one folds down in the 
back. This camper has an electric refrig and a propane stove behind the 
front passenger seat and a sink and closets behind the driver. There's a 
dinette where the back seat normally is with the seats on each side 
facing in. All of the camper part of the interior is in pretty good 
shape, the bus itself has been sitting for almost nine ! years and I 
fear the worst for the entire driveline. The body is fair with some rust 
on the front by the windshield and a couple minor dings in the side. Is 
this beast worth saving? I have never owned a pancake engine before and 
am kind of leery of tackling this one.I'd love to hear any suggestions
