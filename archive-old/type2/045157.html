Subject: [T2] leaky oil pump I think

Hello all ,

Thanks again for the help up till now. 
I've got a serious oil leak coming from dead center in the rear (rear is 
rear) of my engine.It only leaks after the engine has run for several 
minutes and not after it has been shut down. I've looked up at the oil 
cooler and I don't think that is it. I suspect the oil pump. I'm screwed 
on getting a new one till labor day weekend ends. After looking at it for 
a while the only way I can see to access it for assesment and possible 
replacement is to put a floor jack under the motor and remove the motor 
mounting bar. Does anyone know a better way?? This won't be to bad but I 
figured I put it out there to the collective wisdom of the list.
