&gt; &gt; I'm currently looking at the Subaru SVX 6-cylinder.  I am trying to figure
&gt; &gt; out if the Subaru tranny can have its ring gear flipped like a VW's for
&gt; &gt; bus use.  This would give a nice 5-speed transmission with the ratios to
&gt; &gt; match the power!
&gt; 
&gt; --&gt; I've heard it claimed that flipping the ring gear in a VW transmission
&gt; (for example, to use it with a Corvair engine) makes it last about 5,000
&gt; miles instead of 500,000, due to everything turning the wrong direction
&gt; inside.  Might want to think twice about doing that to a Subaru tranny.

the difference here is that the VW transmission was being turned backwards
whereas the Subaru I'm considering would be turned correctly.  flipping
the ring gear would only change the output shaft direction, not the toot
contact .

VW did this themselves when they went to the reduction-box transmissionin
the bus.

I still have no definitive word on whether the design of the Subaru
transmission allows flopping.
