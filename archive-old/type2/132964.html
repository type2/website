Subject: Re: [T2] Long block web site?

Tom,

www.shockwaverider_dot_com/avp/

http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newengine/

www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/

About 1,000 miles so far, runs better and gets better gas mileage with 
every fill up.

I had to redo one side with a new valve cover gasket at the very 
beginning....that's all so far!


Cheers, dave

&gt; Some time ago, someone posted the list about purchasing and installing a 
&gt; long block from Bus Depot (AVP). I don't remember who it was but I think 
&gt; they said they were going to take some pics and post them on there web 
&gt; site. Does anyone know who this was or if the site was posted. I am 
&gt; thinking of doing the same thing and I would like to learn from someone 
&gt; else's experience before I shell out the bucks for the long block.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for letting me ramble. As always, I really appreciate your advice
