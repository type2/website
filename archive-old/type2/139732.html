&gt; My research indicates that the VW Bus calls for a Group Type 41 battery. . .
&gt; I'd like to get a Costco branded battery (cost &amp; warranty) - but it appears
&gt; as thought they don't sell a type 41.  They do sell a group type 47 (I have
&gt; that in my BMW Bavaria - a six cylinder - so far a great battery at a good
&gt; price) - it is smaller than the type 41 though.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts on group size, CCA, ah, brand, etc.?

I stick the biggest battery that will fit in the space safely

I currently have a 950CCA Exide in there and it has been working great.
don't know the price since I can get em wholesale.

(actually I have two of em, dual battery setup)
