Buy a new Blaupunkt to put in there. 

When I was at JBB last month I was sitting in the truck listening to the
radio. Turned off the key and the radio went off like it should. I have NO
idea why, but I reached over and pushed the power button. ~~ The radio came
on.

I turned the key on then back off and the radio went off again. I turned it
on and off a couple of times with the key out, worked fine.

So, I left the key out and sat there listening to the radio. After about an
hour, it went off on it's own. I turned it back on ~~ and it went off again
an hour later.

When I got home I pulled up the manual online and discovered it's a feature
I didn't know about. This is a Blaupunkt &quot;Alaska&quot; from about 2000 or so,
and &quot;older&quot; model CD deck. I've had this same radio in my Beetle, the '74
bus, and now in the Ch*vy truck. I'm planning to buy an MP3 model for the
Rivi at some point (the satellite radio and a set of 12volt computer
speakers is OK for now).

I have an alarm/remote start/keyless that will go in the Rivi after it's
running. I think I'll use the remote start feature to turn on the BN4 after
I get it working rather than to start the engine. I'll have to convert the
BN4 timer from the original mechanical to an electronic though.
