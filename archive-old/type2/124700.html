Subject: Re: [T2] wolfsburg west seat pads, 68-74 

It SOUNDS like maybe you received a back pad for a later Westy. The late
westy pad was thinner and a bit taller than the older buses. I would check
the part number on the package, etc. and call Wolfsburg West and confirm you
received the right pad for your application.

The bottom of the seats is pretty similar.

The original plaid material is rather durable and should not have &quot;shrunk&quot;
on you.

Good luck!!
