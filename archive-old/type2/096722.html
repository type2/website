&lt;&lt; Anyone who doesn't have the money for a shop manual, doesn't have money
for gas either--until they've saved up the whopping twenty-six bucks, or so,
for the _at_#$!! Bentley.  C'mon folks, if you don't have one, get one!
 &gt;&gt;

Easy now...If it's a choice between $26 for gas to get me to work and a
manual, well. Lotsa folks on this list bought a VW for all the reasons that
VW usta be famous for...Cheap, dependable wheels...They may not be all
that anymore, but that's what got 'em where they are today. Lotsa folk
on this list are tryin' to keep a 25+ year vehicle alive with a bicycle bud-
get...a little support goes a long way.

BTW, for cheep books try:

New or used, cheapest, including shipping...Try it!
