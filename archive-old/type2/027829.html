Do you mean the center rear-view mirror inside, above the windshield?

and if so, do you mean removing the stem from the bus, or the stem from the 
morror back.

On my 69, at least, you turn the stem to one side. A motion similar to a 
pendulum swing. It does take some force. And even more to put it back in, 
but you have to make sure the base of the stem is as flush with the header 
as possible, and try starting it on one side versus the other.

Like, the mirror body hanging to the left of center, twist to right. Or 
mirror hanging right of center, twist to left.

For me, at least, one way went in easier than the other.  I can't remember 
which way it was, but I do remember trying it from the other side and it 
went in easier. Try putting a tiny dab of grease on the metal surface of the 
mounting bracket.

&gt;I removed the stem to my rear view mirror (from my 1980) with brute force
&gt;and can (now) not figure out how to best put a new one back in without 
&gt;brute
&gt;force. Anybody done this before???
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
