Subject: sealing treasure chest leaks on pickups

--=====================_12655016==.ALT

hey folks, does anyone know how the wood slats are supposed to be mounted 
on pickup beds?  My 74 SC simply has screws going through the wood slats 
into the metal floor and when I'm driving in the rain, the treasure chest 
gets very wet inside.  I would assume there should be some type of rubber 
washer thingy under there but can't find any literature on the 
subject.  tia, Greg
