Subject: vented,slotted,drilled??

it seems to me so far in researching the subject that nearly all cars today
come with a vented disc.  only in high performance apps are they drilled and
slotted.  

so the next question is where to get a standard size vented rotor??  i have
checked a few performance shops and they are looking into it.  anyone with
other ideas?

as to the reason for this thread...my 73 bus is used in the summer months as
one of my daily driven work vehicles.  i have a small landscaping/lawn
service and the bus is used for the fertilizing part of the business.  it is
also used to make my pick-ups of 40-50 50# bags regularly thru the summer. 
and is driven in the city with stop and go traffic.  the bus continues to
perform great, but am pondering the ease of making the brake system more
heavy duty.

one down side of having vented discs is that you are unable to have them
turned as many times as a solid disc.  thus if you go to a shop that has no
clue what to do, they will turn it to much and this is where the warping
occurs.
