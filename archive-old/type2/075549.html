Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78


I can personally attest to the part that says

 Vw fuel pumps are push pumps,
&gt; they don't pull fuel very well at all, so any obstruction upstream of
the
&gt; fuel pump would make it seem like the pump was faulty.


Very recent personal expierience.&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers ,dave

&gt; This is going to sound strange but I've done it myself and I know it works.
&gt; F*rd trucks model years 85 to 88 have external bosch fuel pumps that are
&gt; identical to vw bus external fuel pumps for fuel injected vehicles.   Used
&gt; ones go quite cheaply, much cheaper then used vw pumps.  
&gt; 
&gt; However, before I coughed up the dough for a new pump I would check that
&gt; your fuel filter or fuel line wasn't plugged.  Vw fuel pumps are push pumps,

&gt; hope that helps, Jason.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Fellow Bus owners:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up or
&gt; &gt; something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will not
&gt; &gt; pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying $127~
&gt; &gt; for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now.  I
&gt; &gt; have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
&gt; &gt; higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale for
&gt; &gt; cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
&gt; &gt; obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld it
&gt; &gt; back together?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any Ideas? Any Help?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;
