I really agonized over this. Really. I lost sleep over it!

What to put on the floor of the Guacamole Bus?!?!?!

heh

The way I built the Westy bed, I ended up with an area a nearly
perfect 4' x 5' rectangle. Talk about making life easy!

I picked up a sheet of HDF (&quot;hardboard&quot;) at Lowe's for $5. This stuff
seems to absorb sound a lot better than plywood. And it's so darn
cheap, I could replace it annually and wouldn't sweat it. An area rug
8' x 5' from Wally World ran $20. I cut the 4' wide hardboard at 60&quot;.
I cut the 5' wide carpet at 48&quot;.

A match made in heaven!

I have some rubber flappy stuff that will go on the carpet to fill the
edges. I think it's supposed to be for tile/carpet borders. Whatever.
It suits MY needs. I'll finish that Monday.
