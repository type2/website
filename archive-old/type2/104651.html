Subject: Re: [T2] Clocks in Buses

Clock?  When I bought my '79 bus it had an ammunition
counter in the dash!  It came off a WWII British
Spitfire and apparently the second owner bought it
while he was in England. I am now in the process of
restoring the van and when I pulled the dash I took it
out. Three of the four previous owners of this van
(all military) are still in the local area and one
told me that his wife works in the same building that
I do so when I met her for the first time I inquired
about the counter.  She smiled and said that her
husband had hot glued it in and had tears in his eyes
when he parted with van cause he couldn't get it out. 
She asked if I would consider selling it and I said
&quot;Sorry but it's not mine to sell&quot; and I gave it back
to her.  Once I get it restored, I'm going to have a
barbeque listen to the stories, learn its history and
let them all drive it one more time.

Stan
