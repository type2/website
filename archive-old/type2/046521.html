&gt; &gt; Michelin need the individual  axle weights front and rear to give accurate
&gt; &gt; pressure recommendations.

&gt; the bottom margin of this VIN sticker and you'll find
&gt; something that looks like this:
&gt;
&gt; GVWR  LB.  4961
&gt; GAWR  LB.  FRONT 2227 / REAR 2800

Hi there,

GVWR = Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
GAWR = Gross Axle Weight Rating

The GVWR is the maximum loaded capacity of the bus, based upon structural and
suspension design.  The GAWR is the maximum loaded capacity of each axle based
upon the stock equipment tires installed by VW at time of manufacture, the axle
bearings, and the suspension.  The correct tire has a size designation of 185 SR
14 Reinforced on 72 and newer Campmobiles.  Or 185 R 14 C on mid 72 and newer
delivery vans and station wagons.  These two descriptors indicate a heavier
construction tire than the passenger car tires without the Reinforced or  C
immediately after the number 14.  I have seen many Westys out there running
passenger rated tires.

The reason for the above explanation is to lead into this:

The GAWR for the front and rear axles add up to 5028 pounds, VW rates the bus for
a maximum GVWR of 4961.  My C rated tires are rated at 1710 pounds each at 55
PSI.  I would reach the tire load limit at a weight of 6840 pounds, no doubt
causing stress on the axle bearings, suspension, and vehicle structure.  My guess
is that I am not overloading my tires at 30 PSI and 40 PSI, front and rear,  If I
am on a long trip, and want to reduce the rolling resistance of the tires, I can
pump them up to 55 PSI, and gain a little in fuel economy.  The road noise and
rough ride is a little tough at 55 PSI.  Passenger car tires may be max rated at
32 or 35 PSI.  This is probably why VW calls for the heavier tires.

My bottom line is do not over load the bus beyond the GVWR of 4961 pounds, or
whatever your federal certification label states.

Any help?

Mike D.
