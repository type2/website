Subject: [T2] Carbs or FI?

HI!

I've got a question I've been fighting with...and couldn't find enough
information on the web to make a desicion.

Which is better?  A carborated engine or one with Fuel Injection?

I've seen plenty of rebuild kits that are Carborated...but no FI's.  Is this
due to cost? Or are Carborated engins that much better?(performance or ease
of repair?)

I have a running '79 Stock FI engine and I'm trying to decide what to do
when I rebuild the engine, I would like something larger (it's a 1800) but
can only find them Carborated.

Thanks for your info!
