Isaiah,

These guys are right down the street from my house (abt 2 miles) and I just
happened to stop by there today looking for a part.  They are first a bug
supplier, second a sand rail and way down there on the list is bus parts.
Typically the parts in common with a bug fine, but  it gets iffy from there.
The counter staff is always busy and I have never walked in there without at
least two customers ahead of me.  The building is fairly new and looks to be
well stocked.  No worries here about fly by night.  Since I am local, I
cannot vouch for their shipping policy, promptness and return policy. FWIW, I
happened asked for a catalog one day and they pointed to the ad in the back
of the latest mag.

For my parts acquisitions, I have
Foreign Unlimited - 1.5 miles.
So Cal Imports - 2 miles
Bill &amp; Steves - 5 miles
Bus Depot - my keyboard
Aircooled_dot_net - my keyboard

I've used all of these and keep going back for more.

Scott
