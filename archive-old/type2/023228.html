Well, then here's another one for you all....

In the picture in the link below, I do not see the side bench seat that 
creates an &quot;L&quot; with the rear bench.  So, where there different tables with 
different options?

I have all of the assembly that looks similar to the arm/hardware of the 
table I had with my '78.

&gt;74-75 was rectangular, wood grain covered, and mounted to the wall. It

&gt; &gt; I'm trying to determine if the table arm and mounting that is on my bus is
&gt; &gt; original or was taken from a new bus by the PO.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have one of those L-shaped arms bolted to the side of the sink unit.
&gt;The
&gt; &gt; table top isn't original (round w/ shelf paper...yuk!)
&gt;
&gt;No, this is wrong.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I was looking at this picture of the interior
&gt; &gt; (http://www.type2_dot_com/library/camper/westpics.htm)
&gt; &gt; and I was wondering, which table came with the deluxe westy.
