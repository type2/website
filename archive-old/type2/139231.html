&gt; And you did take pics of everything inside to prove to yourself 
&gt; later(when
&gt; you hear funny noises) that you really did have the timing marks lined 
&gt; up,
&gt; etc?&lt;grin&gt;

Does this answer your question?

Yeah, but you know what I can't take a picture of? The sealant spread 
on the case parting line once the halves are torqued together. Guess 
what I'm sweating about this morning.

&gt; Looks gorgeous!

Thanks.

&gt;
&gt; And, you can buy a *new* Bosch vac can at autozone for $11.00.
&gt; See the archives.

Cool! I'll do a search.
