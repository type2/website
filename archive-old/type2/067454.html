Volks, 

A quick answer, without the book in font of me, so excuse any year
incompatibility.  The T4 engine/tranny years do not *need* the tranny
support.  The tranny is supported at the front by the &quot;U&quot; thang and at the
rear by a pair of bolts into the hanger bracket.  If you are careful not
to try to hang the engine off the input shaft, you will not damage the
tranny.  OTOH, if you *do* manage to fail to clear the tranny input shaft
before you drop the engine, you will save the case by having supported the
tranny (you will still kill the tranny, however). 

I have always found it easier to drop the engine and tranny as a unit. 
Disconnect the wires, fuel, clutch cable, drive shafts (inboard end, wire
'em up) put a 2x12 under the unit and a hydraulic jack under the 2x12.  A
stroke or two on the jack and take out the tranny carrier bolts.  Take out
the engine carrier bolts.  lower the rear of the unit ~4&quot; to clear the
engine bearer and release the front tranny bolts.  Lower away.  Raise the
body *after* the engine/tranny unit is down and pull it out the back.  Let
me know if you require more details.
