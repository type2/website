&gt; The battery is having a harder  time in that weather for sure but if

I'll go check it out and follow-up.

&gt; First try to clean all of the connections (battery terminals, starter 
&gt; terminals, both ground straps). That can make a bigger difference than 
&gt; most people realize.

Yah, I'll go ahead and do this today or tomorrow.  But, like I said, 
the starter is spinning when this happens ... I can hear it whirring!  
But the shaft is not popping forward to engage the flywheel.  Is this a 
symptom of insufficient juice?

&gt; When you bought your bus didn't you remove a solenoid type hard start 
&gt; relay from it?

No, that is still in the circuit.  I have a WR1 kit that the PO bought, 
sitting in my parts cabinet at home.
