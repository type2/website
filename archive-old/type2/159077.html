Subject: M-Plate Question

   Hello all,

   My name is Greg Smith -- I've been on list list for a while with the 
address rnrkeys_at_hotmail_dot_com. Troy Wical saved me in Colorado last fall 
with help from Don &quot;DurocShark&quot; Tuleja.

   I've been trying to find out some info on my '69 westy and found this 
on the type2 website: http://www.type2_dot_com/m-codes/index.html which has 
been a huge help. It's cool to finally know the original color was pearl 
white (she's primer gray and white now) and the she was originally a 
pop-top (wasn't sure), but I am wondering if anyone might be able to 
help me with a couple unknowns? You can see my M-Plate here: 
http://www.geocities_dot_com/gregorypjsmith/M-Plate1.jpg .

   I am mostly curious about the TR export destination (just out of 
curiosity) and I don't fully understand the explanation of TT and XXXX 
(http://www.type2_dot_com/m-codes/t2models.html). My plate says 21 and 2310, 
but I can't figure out how to read those.

   Thanks!
   Greg Smith
   1969 Westy &quot;Patience&quot;
