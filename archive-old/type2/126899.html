Subject: How do i get off?

I may get hurt for asking this, but how do I get off
this list?  I have lost the &quot;vw bug&quot; and have moved on
to the econoline bug.  Sorry for any agitation this
may likely cause, but I have lost all interest and
don't want the messages clogging up my e-mail.  Thanks.
