Subject: Re: Removing the dividers - was: [T2] New dude on the block

was writ

 This brings up a question I've been meaning to ask fro some time.  Does
 anyone have a solid info, or informed opinions on what the effect of
 removing the dividers behind the front seats would have on the integrity
 of the van?

I know they removed them in some later westys so the seats could swivel, but
I don't know if they reinforced it somewhere else. Myself, I don't like it,
stiff is better.
