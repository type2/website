Subject: price on a '72 hard top camper?
Message-ID: &lt;19990625071103.7996.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hey volks,

One of our local autowreckers has a sweet '72 hard top camper sitting in 
their yard, i was wondering what a resonable price for it may be?

specs:
-totally rust free body
-intact runnable engine
-most of the interior
-no wheels
-needs new brake system.
-straight body
-anything else i should be looking for???

and also a couple weeks ago i was looking through a site and i came across a 
picture of a splitty convertable, it was brownish yellow, had role bars and 
had two surfer looking dudes in it. if anyone would be consiterate enough to 
direct me to this site, i would be very thankful, that is if you know it's 
where abouts.thanks
