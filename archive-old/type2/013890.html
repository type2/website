Subject: Re: [T2] VW show in Knoxville, TN

I am going... That is, if the new paint job gets done
in time! What a close call! I'll be in a '73 Westy.
The bottom half will be a freshly painted Indigo Blue.
The top half will be White. Do you know when
registration starts &amp; How to register? I've never been
to a show...
                                    Thanks,
                                    Paul Deatherage

&gt; Greetings all!
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if anyone was planning on attending
&gt; the Bug Jam in
&gt; Knoxville, TN this weekend?  It's a pretty nice two
&gt; day show.
