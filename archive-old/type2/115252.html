Subject: 73 Westy, won't idle, backfires after oil change, new coil, new
  plugs

Hi-

I am thoroughly stumped.

The other day, I changed my oil, replaced my spark plugs, and put in a new
coil. It ran reasonably well afterwards, but had gotten progressively worse.
After about 90 minutes of driving, it will not idle, backfires, and has no
power when revved-up.

I have tried my known good spark plugs, condenser, coil, and replaced the
points. When I remove the spark plug wires from the plugs while the engine is
running, there is no clear cylinder that is not firing. I have removed the
valve covers to take a look, and cannot see anything amiss.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Cheers,
Matthew
