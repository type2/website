 Arrived around 5:00pm Saturday. The only campers there were
in those HUGE R.V.'s that cast long shadows so we went over
to the the other side of the field where there arent any hookups.
Parked under the only tree there. Put up the tarp and got the
heat going and settled in to watch the Yanks beat the Padres.
  About 9:00 heard a commotion outside and found we were 
surrounded by 6 Busses (an one f*rd Tauris). Got out, said hi
but it was cold and raining so retreated to &quot;Gunter&quot;. Fell asleep
about 10:30. 
  6:30 AM I wake up to the pagan rumble of dozens an dozens
an dozens of V-Dubs. All of the traders/show Volks are lined up to
get in about 30 yards away from where our little circle is camped.
  Wow! Was pretty cool as the fog was kinda heavy and they looked
like they were floating out in the field.
   Got up, made coffee for me and hot choc. for my son Andy. Dined
on frosted flakes and Andy watched some early morning fishing show.
Packed up and moved to the main parking lot an in we went.
      Was a huge event! Met up with Fred Stoermer while looking
at the most well preserved camper I had ever come across!  Fred is
actually a handsome devil. I suspect he spreads this dis-information
to avoid building a base of groupies. Who knows. 
    Stopped an said hi to Dawn Smyth, she is still fun to talk with and
her stuff is still great and her kid is moven real fast now!
  BUS CONTENT: Before you cut the deck to get to your fuel sender,
go to a good marine supply house and buy a flushmount bulkhead. They
come in many sizes and are usually kinda oval shaped with a &quot;O&quot; ring
seal. They are designed to be water/vapor proof and easy to remove for
access to storage areas on a boat. Buy it first then cut the hole per the
template that &quot;should&quot; come with it.
