I just opened my brand new Haynes manual ($13 BTW) and the first 
picture I found is of a carburated Vanagon.  I have a '80 and the 
book covers the air cooled Vanagons.  So they were available on a 
Vanagon.  Never seen one though, but then again I live in California.

&gt; I think he's asking until which year was a westfalia offered with a
&gt; carburated engine.
