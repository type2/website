Subject: learn from my flywheel mistake
Message-Id: &lt;v01510100b34ac9c498ea_at_[207.172.119.145]&gt;

After the second rebuild of my 1776 in thirteen months,  I ran it on a
stand in the garage for probably an hour balancing the carbs, checking for
oil leaks, and squirting alcohol around the throttle shafts to uncover any
air leaks. I ran it on the road for maybe ten miles.  Then two
&quot;unpleasantries&quot;:  Every time I depressed the clutch pedal, I heard the rpm
shoot up and then back down. At idle,  there was a clunking coming, I
thought, from inside the case.

I pulled the engine, and proceeded to strip the entire top end down to, but
not including the heads. I grabbed the pulley and flywheel to rotate the
crank and try to reproduce the clunk.  The flywheel was loose in my hand.
The gland nut was probably half way out.

I checked my notes and find that I did a really stupid thing. I didn't use
Loctite on the threads. I was so anxious to make it easy to remove the
gland nut for the inevitable next rebuild that I greased the thread
instead.  Big mistake. Every how-to-rebuild-it manual agrees that Loctite
is necessary. Now I am a believer.  Don't make this mistake.

Secondly,  check the easy things first.  If I had only thumped the flywheel
before stripping the top end, I sure would have saved myself a lot of time
in reassembly.
