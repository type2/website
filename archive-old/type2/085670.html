Subject: ariel group shot


Hi,

If you want to get an ariel picture of the campsite for cheap there is a 
model rocket made by estes:

http://www.estesrockets_dot_com/products/product114.html

What it does is it has a tiny camera in the nose cone so when it reaches 
altitude it tips over and starts taking a series of pictures (not sure how 
many) of whatever is below.  This kit appears to come with everything you 
need except the film but I am sure any decent hobby store would either carry 
the film, or know where to get it.  The only real problem is that you have 
to find the rocket after which shouldn't be hard with everybody out there to 
help you look.

I hope this works out.  Unfortunately much to my chagrin I can't go to EB :( 
  but the worst part isn't having to miss it, its hearing everybody yack 
about how great it was, and then seeing all the pics..... *sigh* maybe next 
year.
