&gt; Okay, I'm back here on Vancouver Is and life is great, if not wet. 'Course 
&gt; I
&gt; go to get gear oil for the trans and everyone I ask for GL-4 looks at me
&gt; like I have 2 heads. Two questions, only thing I could fine with a GL4
&gt; rateing is something for tractors called TDH- trans, diff, hyd but no 
&gt; weight
&gt; rateing. Will this stuff work? Second, does anyone on the Island know where
&gt; I can find Sta-lube? I know they still make GL4 80-95 wt.
&gt; 
&gt; Drove the 68westy for the first time since I got it two years ago, almost
&gt; forgot how many grins per mile it could be.
&gt; thanks

Chuck,

I get my GL4 at Sears in the automotive section.  I know that Sears is big in 
Canada, so give it a look see.

Good Luck
