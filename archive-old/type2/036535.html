Subject: Westy interioe help.

Hi Volks,
Just started to breakdown my '70 westy for a good cleaning and some
interior repair. I need to make some panel sides to replace a very poor
job from the PO.  How are the original panel attached to the bus?  Also
what is the molding around the closet door called?  Not the t-molding
but the other.  Mine has shrunk and wrinkled.  Any help is appreciated.
Anyone done a custom interior and have pics up on the net somewhere?

Jamie
