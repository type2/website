Howdy,

Ok, I got the diagrams labeled, thanks again to Jim Bryant, and I even
included sizes, so you know what you're getting yourself into.  I also have
chassis numbers on them, thanks again to Jim.

I'm still looking for pre-'62 diagrams, to complete the collection.  The
current crop goes from '62-'67.  I would _love_ to have barndoor diagrams as
well!

You'll find the diagrams at: http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/techinfo.html
