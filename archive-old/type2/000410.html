	About two and a half years ago I coughed up $900 for a complete job from Tom Noble Engines in Ballard. He only did air-cooleds, he only did complete rebuilds and he only did &quot;stock.&quot; His shop was spotless. I had a Bosch oil pressure sensor in the case which he left in, but he insisted on giving me a new stock switch along with some other aftermarket parts he'd removed. He told me it was included in the flat rate. The flat rate was $855 and I paid a core charge for one unusable head. I did this after pricing around rebuilts in Northern California and realizing that it was going to mean a 24 hour roadtrip in a borrowed pickup if I didn't want to mess with a fortune in shipping (both North AND South with the core). I also didn't want to mess with any warranty issues from two states away.
	That engine is ticking away like a champ. Best $900 I ever spent. The pisser is that Tom has since sold the company and it's now called &quot;German Engine Exchange&quot; or something like that. I haven't done any business with them but I did call them a few months ago in a pinch looking for a gland nut on the fly. They said they didn't have any new on hand but they did have a big box of used I could pick one from. I asked if they didn't stock new ones for rebuilds. I was told that they reuse the gland nuts when they rebuild. Interesting. Slightly scary. So I guess I'm not able to offer a recommendation but instead a caveat.
	I don't deal with paid mechanics much. Sending the Beloved Beast to a shop is like my firstborn's first day in daycare. I do it as rarely as possible and usually grumble about the results when I do. But I try to be aware when a job is outside of my abilities or my resources (space, tools, time, etc). Doug's in West Seattle has been well recommended to me recently. If they don't actually do the rebuild I imagine they farm it out to someone they trust.
	I'd be curious to see what other recommendations people make; my time is such lately that I need to hook up with a reasonable and reliable shop.
