Subject: from mechanical to hydraulic?

I've just acquired a 77 Westy Deluxe and of course it is mechanical valves.
What is entailed in making it hydraulic? I always hear the arguements that
the cams are different etc, but it is not a sure thing. Can I pull out the
mech. tappets with a magnet and slide in hydraulic and live happily ever
after. Somehow I think I'm fooling myself it's that easy. :-)



Thanks

Courtney
