&gt;Hi all,

&gt;     I was looking at a another westy today &amp; found something odd.
&gt;Underneith between the frame rails was some kind of protective plate.
&gt;Coming out the side of the van in front of the drivers side rear wheel was
&gt;what looked like a exhaust pipe.  I can not see anything because of this
&gt;plate.  Any ideas?  I probably will not buy the bus as it needs a transaxle.

This is a troll, right?  :-)  Sounds like the bus is equipped with a gas
heater.  Might be worth finding a new transaxle for it if the price is
right.  Much easier to install a transaxle than a gas heater.
