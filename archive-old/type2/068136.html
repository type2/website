Subject: Re: Very Original 1971 WEsty Worth?

&gt;Over the weekend I got a call from an Old &quot;Cherman Man, 
&gt;about a Westy he has had since 1972.
&gt;
&gt;Here is the poop...
&gt;
&gt;*80,000 original miles
&gt;*original paint, mechanicals all in excellent condition 
&gt;(from a cursory glance no hint of rusting!)
&gt;*complete original unhacked interior
&gt;*all bills, recepeits etc. for last 20+ years
&gt;*only driven in the summer
&gt;*meticulous maintenance
&gt;*has owned the bus since 1972 (bought from original owner)

I would like to hear people's 
&gt;thoughts on what they think this bus is worth. I realize 
&gt;that value of a bus is somewhat attributable to scarcity, 
&gt;and rust free busses are mighty scarce up here!
&gt;
Around here (Phila. Pa. area), I'd value such a bus at somewhere between  
US $3000 and $4000, if it's really in the nearly flawless condition you 
describe. '71 is the more desirable of the early breadloaf years (the only 
Bug-engined bus to have a dual port motor and front disc brakes), and 
you're right, rust-free ones are getting hard to find.
