THE WEEKLY GUIDE TO TYPE2 / VINTAGEBUS RESOURCES

Ok, folks, here's some sites that will be invaluable to the Type 2
newbie and oldtimer.  It was created to help reduce traffic on the
lists by providing a quicker way to get that crucial piece of
information that you need to fix your bus.  Always try to check these
sites before posting to the list.

For the folks who are &quot;frameless&quot; the new frameless home page is up! 
See below for details!

Also, there is a new URL for the archives, and the default entry point
is the &quot;complex&quot; search.

Don’t fret if some of these sites don’t work yet.  Lotsa dust is
flying at the website!

TYPE2 LIST SITES:

The Volkswagen Bus Mailing List.  
This is the web site of the Type2 and Vintagebus lists.  If you go to
this site, all the sites below can be easily selected.
http://www.type2_dot_com

Or for those folks who don't do frames:
http://www.type2_dot_com/noframes_index.html

The Type 2 list homepage
http://www.type2_dot_com/type2.html

The Vintagebus list homepage
http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebus.html

The Type2 Archive.  
This lets you search everything that has been posted to Type2 and
Vintagebus since the Jurassic (almost) 
http://vw.i405_dot_com/
Note that it takes some time (months) for posts to find their way to
the Archive. To find newer posts, go to the type2 or vintagebus
homepages and select &quot;read.&quot;

The Type2 Library.  
This has links to hundreds of web pages dedicated to our favorite
vehicle.  It is nicely indexed, so you can go straight to the topic
you want to investigate.

LIST ETIQUETTE GUIDE:

Here is the short version:  

1. Be Nice.  We're just talking about VW buses here.  Keep it light!
2. Write about technical bus stuff.
3. Other Bus stuff on Fridays only.
4. Never post server commands (like &quot;unsubscribe&quot;) to the list.  The
server doesn't pay any attention to the list and it annoys the heck
out of the admins!

WHO’S RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THIS?

Well, this posting, and any errors in it, can be blamed on:
George Lyle,
physicshelp_at_rocketmail_dot_com

The administrator of the www.type2_dot_com website is:
Ken Hooper

The administrator of the Type2 list is:
Steve Dolan
dworkin_at_type2_dot_com
dworkin_at_ari_dot_net

The administrator of the Vintagebus list is:
Thom Fitzpatrick
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com

It’s not such a good idea to pmail the administrators with messages
such as &quot;the list is down&quot;, since there may be 1000+ people in the
same boat.  How would you like to get a couple of hundred pmails in
your box all telling you something you already knew?

Also, for reasons that become obvious if you think about it, you don't
want to post messages to the lists with questions such as &quot;Is the list
down?&quot;.

The best way to go is to see if you can read the list via the
Type2_dot_com website.  If no posts get delivered there, it’s a good bet
that nobody on the lists are getting them either!  On the other hand,
if the list seems to be going merrily on without you for a day or two,
a nice email to the appropriate admin might be in order.  

It’s always appropriate to send pmail to the admins telling them about
the great job they are doing.  Remember, they don’t get paid for their
considerable labors, so your kind words are a major part of their
remuneration.
