Subject: Re: [T2] Semi-Metallic front pads from bus-boys

I buy the $15 ones myself due to budget reasons. When I had my new
Vanagon, the VW dealer told me VW calls for the metallic for safety
reasons due to improved stopping ability on a heavy vehicle.

 Anyone uses these ? I'd like to get opinions.

 Is the almost 2.5 X price increase worth it compared to these ? Is a set
 four or two pads ? I want 4 of course...

 I never got semi-metallic on my motorcycle because i've been told that they
 always squeak and wear the disc way faster. Is that also true in the
 enchanted bus world ?
