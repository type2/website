Subject: Gas Mileage woes...part ??

Hello everyone,

Well, for the past year I have been trying to figure out why my 82 Westy was
getting crappy gas mileage. This past weekend I finally figured it out!!

To recap, I bought this bus running on only 3 cylinders, got a new head from
AVP, got it installed and went on a trip. To my dismay, I got what I figured
out was only 10 MPG. At the time, the odometer didn't work so it was pretty
much a guess. I replaced the fuel pressure regulator, the aux air valve,
points, condenser, wires, plugs, and temp II sensor, adjusted the CO (air
bypass screw) and still got 10 MPG.

Out of desperation, I finally started fiddling with the AFM, specifically,
the little wheel with the numbers on it. The cap had already taken off by
the PO, so I figured, and it was suggested, that it had been messed with. I
first turned it counter clockwise, and the motor ran rough at idle, then
went clockwise until it ran rough again, then put it in the middle. Took it
on another roadtrip, got 15.2 MPG!!! Not great but a heck of alot better
than 10 MPG. I realize that this was a little long, but I wanted everyone to
know that persistence does indeed pay off!!!
