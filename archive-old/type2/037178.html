Subject: 30/31 Carb Problems

Just replaced my old 30 PICT 3 carb w/ a brand new
30/31 PICT carb at the advice of the guys who rebuilt
my 1641cc engine.  The engine only has 2700 miles on
it and was tuned about 500 miles ago.  With the 30/31
I'm getting lots of carbon in and around my tailpipe,
even on the bumper above the pipe and puffs of
visibile smoke on warm-up and with hard acceleration. 
I've adjusted the carb per the instructions and the
Muir book twice.  

Is this a jetting problem?  Is the carb running too
rich? Can this be adjusted out using the air bypass
and mixture screws or do I need to rejet?  And, if I
need to rejet can I just reduce the size of the main
jet or does the air correction jet need to be changed
as well?  Or is there omething completely different
going on here?

The bus is running great (no more hesitiation like I
got w/ the 30 PICT 3), but the visible smoke bothers
me.  It passed emissions w/ the 30 PICT 3.

Any advice is welcome.
