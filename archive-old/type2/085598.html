Subject: Vacuum servo, rusty inside

Hey Folks,

I am doing some brake work (adjust rears, replace front calipers, rotors,
m/c, rear flex hoses) and I have removed the vacuum servo on my 1972 7
seater.  It was kinda rusty outside, especially where, apparently, brake
fluid leaked at some point (maybe recently) and took off the paint.  I have
sanded the outside and plan to paint it, that is no big deal.

On the inside there was about 100-200 ml of some kind of fluid.  My best
guess of what it was is a mixture of water and brake fluid.  I plan to wash
it with rubbing alcohol and 100% methanol to complete remove the water.

The problem is, the inside is really rusty.  What should I do about that?  I
could try to POR -15 the rust in there, but it would be difficult to do, the
opening where the master cylinder goes is small, and the diaphragm spring
would be an obstruction.  I also fear of any paint solvent damaging the
diaphragm.
