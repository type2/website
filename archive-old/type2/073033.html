Subject: Re: Some words from burnaby joe


&gt;	i just bought a 71 westy and was just wondering about some things.  i'm
&gt;pretty new to the whole vw thing so any help would be appreciated.  first
&gt;off, does the 71 have any know problems with it ?

Understand that in the opinion of many knowledgable people the 71 was the
best bus ever made in the entire 33-year US-spec production run. There are
some problems, but they should be viewed in that context:

--You have a one-year-only vacuum brake booster that has either failed, or
will fail. It is very rare and expensive to replace. Most people choose to
drive without it.

--You have one-year-only disk brakes--later brakes were larger. The
calipers are getting hard to find if you need to replace them so maintain
them.

&gt;also, should i be
&gt;changing anything right away ?  someone told me i should change all the
&gt;fuel lines immediately which i thought made sense, anything else ?

That was excellent advice. Replace and clamp all fuel lines NOW, including
the short ones that connect the vent tubes behind the firewall. Do not put
this off and become another burning-bus story, we have heard far too many.
When magnesium burns, nothing your local fire department has can put it out
again.
