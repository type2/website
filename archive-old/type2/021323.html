Why not?  I think they call it sharing ideas!  Isn't that what this list
is
all about? Sharing ideas, and helping others with knowledge/power. Oh,
sorry
maybe someone out there has a patent on wrenching.&gt;&gt;

Jeeeeeeze. You really expect Jake to give up all he knows free of
charge? For Gods sake amn, the doood has got to make a living. Isn't it
enough that he is willing to share some of his expertise? I suspect you
are one of the ones that think all music should be free to via Napster.
And that all art should be in the public domain.

Don't look a gift horse in the moth: just say thank you.
