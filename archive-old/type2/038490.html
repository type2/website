Subject: Poptop color Q.

    I should be old enough to remember this, but what did our Westy tops look 
like when they were new?  There are a some nice restorations in my area, but 
the tops are always done in a bright glossy white that just doesn't look 
right to me.  Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing grungy gray ones.  I'm 
imagining a non-glossy eggshell sort of thing---anybody know for sure?
