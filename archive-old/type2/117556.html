Subject: Re: [T2] BA-6 Gas Heater Part numbers?

&gt; Does anyone know where I can locate partnumbers for the BA-6? I was
&gt; thinking ETKA or whatever that source is called, but I don't know anything
&gt; about it or where to find it? I want to try to get some stuff from my
&gt; dealer but would like to try and get numbers first. I specifically need:
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a new coil?

I have found that a regular VW coil will work, I've been using one for
several years now after the heater coil failed.  (this is on a BA-4 so
there might be some differences YMMV)
