Subject: Re: [T2] Questions about timing

Thanks for info below. I will check to see where TDC is on #1.

If I find TDC on #1 corresponds with the TDC according to the piston, then
as you say, I must also have TDC on #3. Is there any reason why firing #3
instead of #1 is a problem ? Apart from convention, as long as the
cylinders
fire in order the first one surely doesn't matter. This probably sounds
like
a really basic question to everyone but if I don't ask I won't know. The
only thing I can think of is that we are on the wrong part of the stroke,
but if that is the case the engine shouldn't fire.

Anyway, I don't think I was clear about what I am trying to do. I'm testing
the timing statically. The timing strobe stays in the box until I
understand
static timing.

The confusion comes for me when I read in Muir &quot;Get out your
static timing light, test the bulb, then clip the clip to the connection on
the coil where the thin wire from the coil to the distributor is
connected&quot;.
I don't have a thin wire - I have two and they both go to the Petronix.
Once
I find this wire I understand that I connect one end of the light to this,
the other to a ground and then turn the engine. When the &quot;points&quot; close the
light should come on and this should co-respond to TDC or when the notch
passes the line on the case. With Petronix, what do I connect the light to
?
(I did try both coil terminals but the light just stayed on but then I
expected that as my reversing lights also feed of this and if the power
switched on and off they would pulse instead of being constant)

The one thing I know is that this is a nicely running van - everything
works OK I'm doing this because I want to move on from the bolt
on jobs I can do (starter motor off in five minutes, no problem) to the
adjusting jobs I've shied away from and paid to have done.

.....
&gt; I've got some questions about engine timing on Ashleys 1600 - Type 1
&gt; engine - proper vacuum advance distributor with Petronix.
&gt;
&gt; 1) At TDC, according to the mark on the flywheel, the rotor is pointing
&gt; away
&gt; from the no.1 cylinder mark on the dizzy body. Looking at the wires, the
&gt; rotor is on no.3 at  TDC. I guess this means the dizzy is at 180 degrees
to
&gt; where it should be since the engine is new (Remtec). Does this matter ?
If
&gt; it does, do I just rotate the body 180 degrees ? I did try &quot;correcting&quot;
the
&gt; order of the wires to the plugs, but then couldn't get the engine to fire
&gt; so
&gt; I put them back again.

Check TDC by pulling the #1 spark plug, use a thin metal screwdriver,
and feel the piston gently push upward as you turn to TDC. IF THE PULLEY
AND PISTON AGREE ON TDC, then you have a dizzy 180 out. Only then.

You remedy this NOT by turning the dizzy body, but by removing the dizzy
and checking drive shaft orientation, which is described well in iodiot
guide and Bentley, Hanes, etc. The dizzy drive might be in wrong.

Actually, re locating the wires should make it run, but isn't the best
way to address this.

Since moving them made it not run, I BET YOU WERE AT TDC FOR NUMBER 3!
Bascially, that pulley makes its way from TDC at #1 BDC at #2 TDC at 3,
and BDC at 4. This assumes hand rotation counterclockwise when you set
you valves for instance, and when in running order (clockwise), results
in teh firing order 1-4-3-2.

I imagine everything is ok, you can prove this by checking out TDC as
above for #1. then feel better.

&gt;
&gt; 2) I though I'd check the timing anyway using the idiot guide. Is it the
&gt; big
&gt; fat central wire the test light is attached to ? Won't this blow up my
test
&gt; light ? Assuming the position of the dizzy above, will my test be valid ?

NO! Timing light pickup if from CYL #1 wire never from Coil wire! Make
sure you are timing the engine to the right dizzy model. If it is around
TDC at idle, and advances though vacuum to 28-32(sometimes 34), as
RPM/Vac increases, you should be fine. Some Vac dizzys can go above the
magic 32 deg advance limit, which I imagine is the point of them in one
way under part load throttles, but that's another subject.

&gt;
&gt;  3) The engine runs smoothly but takes around 5 seconds to start. As the
&gt; engine runs in I've noticed that this has changed. Idle is excellent so
am
&gt; I
&gt; looking at the right thing ? Does timing alter as an engine runs in ?

No, timing is related to RPM, well in your case vaccuum, unless you have
a dual advance dizzy. If this is breaking in, yes they get better
usually.

&gt;
&gt; Most of this is me trying to understand my van better. I could leave well
&gt; alone as running is so smooth, but if I can look and learn now I know
&gt; better for the future.

Good idea. Just be careful. Learn what the valves feel like when they
are set right, firing order, dizzy, and know your carb(s), and hunt and
kill all vacuum leaks.
then tripple check that fuel line you just replaced and enjoy.
