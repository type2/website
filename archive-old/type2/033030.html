Jeff, I'm not certain, but if I had temps of -40 below, I'd be wondering
what to do about that usually thick, now possibly hard tranny fluid. I'll
bet that's your culprit--temperature. Like I've said on this list many
times before, I'm no expert, but that's what my farm sense tells me.

I'd love to hear from others on this!

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Hi everyone,
&gt;    Thanks for the responses to my previous post. When we last left my
&gt;69 camper it was making a loud, clacking noise in reverse. The noise was
&gt;not evident in other gears, but in neutral there would appear a quiet
&gt;clicky-rumbly sound. The sounds seem to be coming from the differential
&gt;area. Here are some more clues: the engine is a 1600 dp, the
&gt;transmission is a '71 or later (I could get the # if anyone suspects an
&gt;engine/tranny compatibility issue) the clutch, pressure plate &amp; release
&gt;bearing are all new. The noise appeared during a week of -40 weather in
&gt;Minnesota. The noise sounds louder inside the bus than it is outside. It
&gt;is hard to get into 1st and 2nd gear. It does not pop out of any gear.
&gt;If anyone has had similar problems or has any suspicions as to what may
&gt;be the problem and or cure, let me know!
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Jefner
