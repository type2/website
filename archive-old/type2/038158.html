Subject: upcoming VW Show.. April 22nd Louisville Ky

Hi volks,

If this sort of thing is not allowed then woops..  but I figured it's VW 
related so..  slap me on the wrist if it makes the admins mad.

The Kentucky Area VolksWage Club is hosting a show-n-shine in Louisville Ky. 
We are also having a campout in Jefferson Memorial Forest afterwards. This 
will be our second club show and from the responses we've gotten so far it 
looks like it will be a biggie.

We have quite a few bus members.. I'm one in spirit.. just a bug driver for 
now..  but I want a camper real bad.. ;)

Also.. for those of you who are familiar with the book &quot;BugTales&quot; by Paul 
Klehbahn and Gabriella Jacobs.. they have graciously agreed to do a book 
signing at the show..

any questions on how to get to the show site..  email me privatly at 
kavw_at_mail_dot_com or at the address in the &quot;From&quot; box.

Hope to see some of you there.. ;)
