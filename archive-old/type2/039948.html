Subject: Re: Bike Rack / 2&quot; receiver on 77 Westy

I took my bus to a local hitch guy, and had him manufacture me a 1&quot; receiver 
with a specially designed hitch that had a flange to bolt a bike carrier 
several inches above the ball.This allows me to carry our bikes and pull our 
pop-top at the same time. Also, it keeps the bike wheels well above the 
ground, so they don't scrape when going thru a dip. Total cost was less than 
$175.00  Any good welding shop can do this for you, or many U-Haul places do 
hitches also. I can get to my engine lid without trouble, but hafta lower the 
rack to open the back door. Hitch works great, 'cept I'm not too happy with 
the way they secured it to the bus, and am going to take it back and have 
another couple of bolts and brackets added to spread the load.
