&gt; I got to about Marana(approx.50 miles)it
&gt; quit.I fought with GEX, next engine made it to Phoenix.
&gt; third Engine made it to the AZ/CA border. At this point
&gt; GEX toldme to piss off, I canceled payment
&gt; (one good thing about AMEX)



My personal (pre-Bus-Depot) experience with GEX engines in my '77 Westy was
also extremely negative, and also required withholding payment on my credit
card in order to get GEX to stand behind their product.
