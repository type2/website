Subject: new email address for stafford

Sorry about all the bouncing email.

They've changed my email address again without my knowledge.
One of these days they'll figure out how to make the &quot;reply to&quot;
address the same as the one that receives mail.  That's what
outsourcing your sys admin will do for your network.

In case anyone wondered, I haven't dropped off the face of the
earth or ignoring y'all.  (If you didn't wonder...  Relax, don't
worry and have a homebrew.)  A couple times a week I catch up via
the www archive page that Skip M. has graciously hosted. Thanks.
Eventually I will susbcribe to the list again.


Anyway, I took the bus out to the Mojave Desert last weekend.
There's a dry lakebed at Giant Rock which is near Landers, CA.
A group of us went out there to fly R/C model airplanes.
In the '50s there was a huge UFO flap and apparently commuter
planes were not the only aircraft landing there.   &lt;*&gt;

The Camper is running good and I found an orange '74 in a junkyard.
I'm slowly grabbing all the goodies off it and putting them on my 
own '73.

Take care,

Jack  '73 Westfalia
