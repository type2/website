Ok,

I'm going try a little here....some of your descriptions leave a lot out.

model westy. it seems to run
&gt; with no fuel pressure


Scuse me?  No fuel pressure?  How do you know?
What does your fuel pressure gauge show when it is running...zero?
Does it ever go above zero?  Is the fuel pressure gauge any good?
Have you tested the fuel pressure gauge on compressed air on anything 
else?

#3  its' running and then you unplug the afm?
    then? the fuel pump shuts off?...hmmmmm, if the fuel pump is off
    then you should lose pressure in the lines if it's trying to run
    but you said it ran with no pressure in the fuel ring....I don't get 
    it.

#4  if you unplug the brake booster line it should die unless it
    is running incredibly rich....probably should die when you do that
    no matter what.

Overall, I would say that you have some injectors that are stuck
wide open, along with the cold start valve(if that model has one).

Otherwise, some condition with the pressure regulator.

You *have* to get a fuel pressure reading somewhere along the way.

Cheers, dave

&gt; ok, I still need help! I've got an 81' cal. model westy. it seems to run
&gt; with no fuel pressure                                                                          
&gt; the original prob was it(I) would be puttin' along just fine then it would just lose power and die! pumping gas had no effect
&gt; #1) 3 of the 4 injectors can be unplugged and it still runs 
&gt; #2) it runs better on 2 than 4 injectors
&gt; #3) will run with AFM unplugged, fuel pump shuts off, no pressure in lines for 30-40 minutes
&gt; #4) unplug vac. booster and it revs to 3000 and stays
&gt; #5) bypass cold start-runs 10-15 min. or more
&gt; #6) checks valves are good
&gt; #7) fuel will still run thru it, pressure test is good
&gt; all of the usual has been tested or replaced and tested again!(AFM, double relay, O2 sensor, cyl temp sensor, etc. per Bently . even swaped ecu's w/no effect!
&gt; is there a &quot;zen mechanic&quot; out there that might fathom this situation?  the analytical approach does not seem to be working for me OR my usually very competent support group
&gt; p.s. email answers/suggestions/prayers to me direct
&gt;          thanks in adv.,  a. hoffmann
