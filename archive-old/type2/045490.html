Subject: [T2] Is this list great or what?  was &quot;Nuts&quot; (and bolts)

I'm sure glad I'm a member of these lists.  A couple of thousand brains are
sure better than my aging gray matter.  If this had been on one of my Fords
I would have bothered to question whether it was sae or metric, but on a VW
I've never come across a sae threaded bolt.  Go Figure.  I took this bolt
into two nut &amp; bolt specialty shops and they both told me they didn't carry
11mm and didn't even question whether it was 7/16&quot;.

Thanks again to all

&gt;I know seat belt bolts are 7/16&quot; fine thread on all cars. Perhaps this size
&gt;would work?
&gt;


&gt;&gt; This is my problem.  The original 11mm x 35 mm bolts that fasten the seat
&gt;&gt; to the frame are now to short.  Evidently, the new body tool worked a
&gt;&gt; little too well and I'm now 20mm wider.  No problem, just order a bolt
&gt;11mm
&gt;&gt; x 55 mm, right.  That's the problem.  No place I can find carries 11 mm
&gt;&gt; bolts with fine threads.  Why does VW use bolts with a bastard dimension?
&gt;&gt; Anyone have any suggestions?
