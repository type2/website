Subject: Hot Running 73 Westy

My 73 Westy has been running hot since buying it two
years ago.  I have been on this list for a year and a half and have 
read all the discussions regarding high engine temps.  I still have 
not found my source of extra heat.  This weekend, coming home from 
Maine, I was hitting my usual 250 temps on the highway.  This is what 
I have:  Twin Solex carbs, 87 Octane, Speed 60-63 mph, 10w-30 oil, 
70F outside temp, 36-40 degree BTDC _at_ 3000 RPM's, 115 psi in all four 
cylinders.  40-45 psi oil pressure at 60 mph/250F. 

Other things:  I have never analyzed my exhaust for fuel 
mixture. (the local VW guru says it &quot;sounds&quot; fine), no pinging etc... 
The temps did not change by replacing the oil cooler.  VDO dipstick 
oil sender (checked accuracy by placing in boiling water).  Engine 
tins and seals are all present and tight.   

Last night I replaced my VDO sender with the original dipstick. It 
passed the Muir temp test no problem.  What's up with that?  I 
constantly worry about the high temps, should I?  I will be doing my 
annual trip down the the Outerbanks of NC in a couple of weeks (sail 
boarding) and would like to get the temp thing under control.  Thanks 
in advance for any of your suggestions.
