Here's a scary thought: Nitromethane was originally invented for use as dry
cleaning solvent. And since its ignition point is higher than gasoline's,
it's probably a safer alternative to gasoline if you've still got a death
wish. (What's preventing more people from washing parts in it than already
do, all none of 'em, is that it's really, really expensive.)

It's mineral spirits for me...reasonably cheap and very effective.

Well, in his defense, he raced a '32 Altered on nitromethane.  Crazy guy,
his daily driver was a '57 Chevy Nomad with a big block 454.  Knew his
stuff, but I think that saying was more anectodal than anything.  I think he
drank the gas and the alcohol mixed, with some kerosene thrown in for good
measure.

I mostly use simple green or a pressure washer.  The powerwasher works
particularly good in empty engine bays!
