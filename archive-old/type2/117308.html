&gt; &gt;69 Bus which Bosch Starter, the SR15X ($96.00) or SR17X ($135.00). Whats the
&gt; &gt;difference if they both fit and have the same warranty?
&gt; 
&gt; The SR17X is mucho heavy duty. It also is stock for the early 911/912 
&gt; Porsche. The SR15X requires the bushing for the end of the shaft in the 
&gt; bellhousing is in good order, but will come with a new one. The SR17X has a 
&gt; much more robust shaft and doesn't use or need this bushing support. Note 

the SR17X is required for an auto tranny bus
