&gt; &gt; It's illegal to transport refilled disposable bottles...
&gt;
&gt; In some states, they're mighty strong on not transporting refilled bottles
&gt; through road tunnels, too.

Not just refilled, but all propane bottles.  Imagine a 5-gallon bottle
getting loose in heavy traffic and rupturing.  Google on &quot;Fuel-Air
Explosive&quot; to get an idea of what could happen.  FAE is basically a
quick-empty propane tank with a timed igniter.  The military uses these
things to make instant helicopter landing zones in the jungle, and that is
not nearly as confining as a tunnel!
