Volks, My heat exchangers are looking a little shabby, and that old, hey
is that a harley? noise is chugging out of the back of the bus. Its Fairly
Warm down here in OZ most of the time and given that my last Bus had 0
heating fixture (removed by PO). I was wondering if I really want to spend
the money on new heat exchangers *BUT* is there an alternative ???? Or any
suggested repair techniques much appreciated (they are a bit rusty around
the header which attaches to the muffler.
