Subject: Re: [T2] Welder Questions?

&gt; My dad is a welding rep so I can have any welder I
&gt; want to use.  So to the people who have do this what is the best and easiest
&gt; to use.  

If you're getting this welder for someone else to weld with and they have
been properly trained, it may be best to ask them what they're preference
is.  Every welder that has some &quot;burn time&quot; will have a favorite welder and
feel most comfortable using that brand and model.

My personal preference is the Miller Matic's they are built for professional
use and will hold up.  The Millers have a long duty cycle and a quality wire
feed system.  With a change of rollers and wire I can go from light sheet
metal work to heavy steel (of course most professional brands will do this).
If you want to add a stitch gun, it will be easier for someone with low time
to weld sheet metal.
