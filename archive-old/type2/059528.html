Subject: Help w/1979 calif. westy...fuel injection

Hello all...this is my first message here. I own a 1979 cal. westfalia.  The only thing wrong with it is it will not run longer than 2 seconds+/-. It used to run just fine, then one day no spark.  Replaced coil--still no spark--replaced ignition module--spark. Now I have a strong spark from the coil as well as to the plugs.  There is fuel in the tank and when the ignition is in start mode the fuel pump is working. I believe it has something to do with the wiring from the ECU to the injectors, but I'm not quite sure what.  I tested for continuity--all wires check out O.K.  This is driving me batty...sugestions would be greatly appreciated My e-mail is stanton_at_rightathome_dot_com.  Please if anyone knows anything, help.
