Subject: Re: [T2] Paint code/name for bumpers and wheels

From Lee Griffiths:

 I've been through all the archives and have not been able to find what 
colour I should be painting the wheels and bumpers on my '71 westy. 
Anyone know ?
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bumpers:
68-70 bay, they were L581 Cloud white. 
Starting Aug 70 [71 model] they were L90D pastell white.
Except on the 68-70 271-274 ambulance bumpers being L567 Ivory. But they are so few and far between.

Wheels:
68-70 L 581 cloud white exc 241-251 which is L 41 black. 
Starting Aug 70 [71 model] L 91 chrome color.
