 Hi all!!.
 
 I do have the same problem.  I have just arrived from a 1,700 Km. trip 
 Sat.13 05:00 Hrs.   till  yesterday 23:50 Hrs.  and my bus came home
smoking.
   
 Last week I saw that the oil was coming down just from the oil filter
 but now its all under the heaters making a lot of smoke.  I gues it could 
 also be the oil cooler or perhaps the oil filter stand. 
 
 Thanks,
 Pedro/
 73 Transporter (Made in Venezuela)
