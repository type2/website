&gt; Hi, All.
&gt; I'm looking for a bra for my loaf. Preferably something in black, 
&gt; straps in
&gt; back, holes in all the right places, maybe a little lace in the front.

Ouch!  I'm a single, middle-aged, normal guy (as normal as a 
middle-aged guy can be who owns a '76 Westy as his only motorized 
vehicle).  I was doing just fine (or at least I've been telling myself 
so) without a female in my life when you had go and start talking about 
bras and straps and lace and the &quot;right places&quot;....
