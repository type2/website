Howdy Folks!
I have a 75 Westy (PO says it has burnt valve) that I am offering FREE to a good home.  The PO (Greg Bouton from Columbus) gave it to me for free, thanks greg, so after I have gotten what I can use off of it, I think it only fair to offer it free to someone else on the list.  Here's the scoop: It DOES HAVE engine and transmission (Greg said it had a burnt valve), all wheels\axles in place so it is able to be towed, I took off the top and luggage rack and rigged them onto my 73 Westy but the top and rack that came off the 73 can be included, the body has your typical midwest rust but I have seen alot worse buses driving down the street, I am using all the camper interior parts for the 73 so these are NOT included (the only interior things included are 2 non-original front bucket seats).  I got the bus for the camper interior, which I am using, and I am not mechanically ready to attempt an interior engine repair, so IT'S yours or it goes to the scrap yard.  I'd rather someone wh!
!
o can use it take it for free, than to take it the scrapper and get maybe $50 for the iron.  I have a GOOD Ohio title and the objective is to get it out of my driveway AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, wife pressure, you all understand ;)  So, it goes to the person person who can get it out of my driveway the soonest!!(after this Saturday, May 12).  Let me know who's interested. 


Peace, John Baker
