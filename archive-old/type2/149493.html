Subject: RE: [T2] Odd noises from beneath...

Hello there
If you can figure out the thump on the passenger side let me know.
My 74 is doing the same thing and I can't figure it out.
I have Koni's which are fine,
wheel nuts are fine
bearings are adjusted and fine,
front end play etc has been adjusted and is fine
Just not sure what it is.
It occurs when I hit potholes or road dips etc.
The shock works fine and does the job so it has to be something
else.
Strange

First off, there's an intermittent &quot;thump&quot;
from the vicinity of the passenger-side front wheel over rough
surfaces (and only heard at low speeds), as if something might be
loose. I don't feel anything strange in the steering; should I be
looking for something like a bad shock mount or something more
serious?
