Subject: Scooby doo bus still a mystery..

hey folks..

happened to walk through the living room a few minutes ago, and my little
brother was watching scooby doo...

The aptly named &quot;Mystery Machine&quot; decided to overheat.  They next showed a
shot of them all staring into the engine compartment.....hmm, says I!
Looks like a barndoor engine bay!!  Huge upward swinging door, and all...

Rear mounted rear engine.  with a radiator, sitting just inside the
barndoor!  Big chrome jobbie of an aircleaner also able to be seen.

How odd.
