&gt; My mechanic refuses to work on them.  I cannot make the passenger side

how true

&gt; OK.  I give up.  I want something good.
&gt; 
&gt; I am contemplating going with dual weber 40 IDF's or dual 34 ICT's.

hit the junk yards and find a 1971/74 411/412 VW,  strip the fuel
injection from one of these, don't pay more than about $50 this is the
same engine that you have in the bus and I have used em in the past works
pretty good too.

you neeed to get the entire intake system including runners.
