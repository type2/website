Salut amateurs de Dormobiles

if you visit our type2 library, you'll find some interesting stories about
Dormobiles.

The Dormobile (not doormobile) conversion is not usual in america.  they
were probably never sold in USA, only in Canada.  All others went over the
sea from Europe with millitary staf comming back home after duty...who
knows?  Anyway, what you describe is a standard setup of the very nice
Volkswagen Dormobile D4/6 motor caravan made by the Martin Walter &amp; co.  in
England.  the stove is a standard equipement as the 2 top bunks.  The child
cot or bunk was an option on this model.  If you have the chance to visit my
website, you see that my bus is equiped with a variety of westfalia interior
cabinets and other units.  bed from a 1970 west,  table and sink from a 75,
roof rack home made etc.  The original equipment is unfortunately gone

If you can put a hand on your camera, can you take a special serie of the
stove so I can be able to reproduce the missig parts as the broiler, and to
understand how to manage the folding shelf.  This will be very appreciate.

Now, for the roof vent: both of mine are gone.  one of the previous owner
replaced them by two standard american car sunroof.  it is very nice but
that wont be neccessary because I now where you can look for a new one.
There is a dormobile mailing list,
http://www.dcn.davis_dot_ca_dot_us/~jfhess/DORlist.html with a lot of landroover
dormobile owners and few Vw ones.  Here's what they said lately:

&quot;Sue still has a stack of vent covers.  The
only contact I have for her is snailmail.  I got 1 of the vent covers
and it is of EXCELLENT quality.  I recommend her product.
Her address is
Sue Dolvin
3720 Hwy 38
Drain, Or 97435
Good luck!&quot;

OK it's in Oregon but if ever your are in an other country, I reccommand you
to get in toutch with the JUSTKAMPER store in england, they got them for
32.90 $UK.  www.justkampers.co_dot_uk
