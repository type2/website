Subject: 1.8L heads for a 2.0L engine
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.21.0103241735580.16179-100000_at_defiant.bie.ispi_dot_net&gt;

I have the opportunity to buy some heads that have been bead blasted, new
guides installed with new exhaust valves, machined intake valves, machined
seats from a 1.8L T4 engine for $100.  They look good in the pictures and
the guy (a non-listee AFAIK) assures me that I won't be disappointed.  Is
this a buyer beware situation?  And will 1.8L heads work on a 2.0L P/C
set?

I'm trying to come up with the parts I need to do a T4 conversion on a
budget and am always looking for deals.  If anyone has a set of heads that
would work for me, I'd sure be interested in knowing what you have
available.  I also am looking for 2.0 crank and rods in useable shape
or as use as cores.

If anyone is close around the Beatrice, NE area - I have a BRAND NEW T4
adjustable Albatross beam that could be used in the trade.  It just sits
in the shop not being used as I was told it wouldn't work in my split
window (something about a bracket is 74 and later?)  I dunno.

Anyway, email me with info at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com
