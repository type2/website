&gt;3-angle valve job and glass-beading, they will cost me about $110.00 per
head,
&gt;until I get my own Souix grinder! Then, $78.00/head! I refuse to pay the
really

Around me, it will go about the same, but ask yourself how many miles
you are likely to really get out of a set of &quot;rebuilt&quot; 1700 heads.  50k-75k
or so at best without seat replacement if they had 75k or so on them.  The
1700's had a terrible rep for running exhausts ridiculously hot when new,
and were the smallest engine to push an otherwise same weight bus.  Yeah
beside that I have about 3 very nice appearing sets of 1700 heads, but do
I honestly think they'd go more than 75k miles in a '78 Westy,  nope.  In
a '67 split, hell yeah maybe, maybe not.

&gt;aren't mant machinists out here who sprechen VW, anymore.I will re-use a good
&gt;std crank, micced out, and a cam and lifters that shows little wear, as the

I had one useable 2.0 crank left out of the 6 I have sitting around to put in
the '82.  Useable to my specs at least.  I have 2 like new 1700/1800
cranks, but we were talking 2.0 initially.  But really having the crank ground
would only have been $60 or so anyway.  Cam and lifters showing &quot;little wear&quot;
on a T4 cam????  You either have lucked into the biggest lode of 20k mile
used core engine or aren't being realistic.  50-75k and the T4 cam will start
showing it's characteristic wear on the intakes.  The wear will progress real
rapidly after that.  Lifters basically considered unusable unless proven
low mile, particularly to run em on a worn cam as the sharp edges and
concave surface will wear it even faster.

&gt;three I now have from scrap engines. The oil pump I usually re4place with a
&gt;Mellinng cast-iron unit, as they last longer and can be sealed to the
&gt;duraluminum case easily

Uh huh, sealed easily.  Funny thing that I had a BP3034 Melling pump to
put in this engine, new for $20 years ago at a swap and even though I
despise using an iron pump in an aluminum case I figured, what the hell.
When I dropped it in the case, it DROPPED in the case.  0.004&quot; smaller than
a used T4 pump, and 0.002&quot; smaller than the hole in the case.  The cast
iron pump, even making the monstrous assumption that it was machined
correctly to begin with will NEVER seal well over time.  It expands at less
than 1/2 the rate of the aluminum part.  Sure you goob it up with silicone
it will get out the door and 30k miles, then it will leak and keep leaking.
Stick to a regular '71 3 bolt aluminum case 26 or 30mm gear bug pump folks
from a good OEM Shadek or the like.

Honestly my cost on the '82 engine was as follows, and I think most people
on the list would be pressed to do it this cheap anywhere.

new P&amp;C's $250 from Manassas 5-6 years ago
2 NICE rebuilt heads, the best cores I had (1 known 8k mile, both no crack
(way rare) square port cores with nice step fly cut, 3 angle valve job, new
ex. guides even though they didn't need it, all new quality valves) $120 each
not including the cores which I don't recall what I paid/swapped for.
crank, had it like I said.
bearings $80 SK and MetalLeve from Bus Depot and local
rods, bushings from Bus Depot $1.50 each, local sized $5 each, big
ends were perfect as is from a recently reconditioned core motor.
cam $75 grind from D. Elgin
Lifters $80, had em 5-6 years, $100 today
everything else the best of the 6-7 engines worth of parts I had.

That's about $700 in parts for me today, drawing from quite a stock
of cores and spares.  Yeah you can scrounge and try to do a &quot;cheap
T4&quot; but realistically it doesn't happen IMHO.  This is as cheap as
it gets and STILL doesn't consider the realistic likelihood of having
to purchase a fully rebuilt, reseated, set of heads from AVP, Bob
Donalds, whoever to the tune of $400-$500.

So I retract my previous statement regarding it costing $1000, if you
skimp, save, find a nice set of rods, crank, and use a set of rebuilt heads
that are going to take you a questionable distance, but admittedly further
than you are likely to own the van.  Maybe $700 or so.  If you go real
cheap and go for used P&amp;C's (there's a nice set of 1700 high compression
going for $1 right now on ebay, lathe honed with new rings) you might
get down around $500 or so.  And it's still going to cost you $500 or
so to gather heater boxes, muffler, intake/carb, flywheel, whatever the
original guy needed to put it into a split or '68-'71 Bus.  I've been
collecting core T4 engines since I was about 16, 14 years now, if
you want to build one on a budget tomorrow, good luck and happy
yard hunting.  It is quite possible, but probable in a timely manner, not
likely.  I love this engine to death, I own no T1 engined buses, and to
tell the truth would probably put a T4 in one if I had one as soon as
I could.  And Scott's point yesterday about doing it on a budget
scrounging parts is well taken.  It doesn't happen fast folks, if you
got the time, by all mean, but as much I can't believe I'm saying this
otherwise, keep it stock and build the T1 well.
