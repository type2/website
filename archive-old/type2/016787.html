Subject: Temp Vanagon List home

Vanagon is off-line until Gerry (the server) makes the journey from San Diego
to B.C.  If you are also a Vanagon list member and you just can't live without
that resource, I set up a temp list on onelist_dot_com.  Unfortunately I didn't
get the post about it out before Chris pulled the plug on Gerry.  So, if you
all would pass the word, there is a temp server out there for Vanagon.  I
didn't get a subscriber list so you will have to subscribe to it.  The direct
subscription address is:

http://www.onelist_dot_com/subscribe.cgi/vanagon

Note:  This list will exist only until Gerry is back on line.
