Subject: Re: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump on T1 engine?

At 07:18 AM 3/12/2003 -0800, John asked:
&gt;I have recently seen a couple of vendors selling
&gt;electric fuel pumps that can mount in the same spot as
&gt;my stock mechanical fuel pump on my 1600 DP engine.
&gt;Anyone have experience with doing this?

People do this when they have to--like when replacing a fuel
pump on a FI engine case.

&gt;Do they work well? Are they really just a scam?

The stock mechanical pump works well.  So I really don't understand
why you would want a noisy electric one.  Which do you think would
be more reliable, a non-rebuildable pump with its own electric powered
pumping mechanism, or a rebuildable pump powered by your engine?

&gt;I have noticed that my fuel filter seems to run empty
&gt;a lot. Even after installing a new mechanical fuel pump.

Of what sort is this new mechanical fuel pump?
Is it one of those cheap-o disposable ones that cannot
be opened (or rebuilt), or a quality pump of the sort
that might have come on the vehicle from the factory?

Does it work?  Is the filter sleeve in the fuel tank, the fuel lines
and hoses, and filters (if any) in good condition?  When you
remove the fuel filler cap, does air rush in to the tank?

No electric pump is going to make up for problems elsewhere
in the fuel system.  Inspect and fix this first, then test your
mechanical pump's pressure and delivery volume, per the
Bentley Manual.  Check the length of the pump pushrod.
Everything in spec?
