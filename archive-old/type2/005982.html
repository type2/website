&gt;This particular shop's style is the &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; overhaul, with new
&gt;case.  He says it'll run about $3400.  Way out of my budget.  And there
&gt;are places around town, he guessed, that would start with the original
&gt;case, etc., and do the job for perhaps $2000, although with a
&gt;corresponding reduction in total quality and lifespan of the job.  A
&gt;devil's choice.

Bill,

I'd say that the shop's style is also a high profit margin:

A rebuilt engine for your bus from AVP (http://www.sacbiz_dot_com/avp/) is $820 
outright, plus about $100 for shipping. Installation for the upright engine 
is a snap (compared to almost any other engine in any other car). If I 
recall, I've seen posts from folks who were quoted about $500 for 
installation.

IMHO a good rebuild is as good as a new engine.

If I were you, I'd get my bus out of *that* shop before they suck you dry.

Regards,
Ed
