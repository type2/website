&gt; &lt;&lt; Well, I just thought I would share the news with you all that its
&gt; snowing like it means business here in Calgary,  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I can only wish that you could send that snow to California...Everybody
&gt; there could use the help... ;-(

Yeah, my school has been closed for two days because of all the ash
blowing around from the Val Verde/Pico Canyon/Simi Valley fires.  While we
in SoCal aren't strangers to poor air quality, having visible chunks in
the air is a new experience.

A nice snowstorm would be quite welcome.

BTW, if you value the finish on your bus, hose the ash off.  It isn't good
for paint, chemically speakiing.
