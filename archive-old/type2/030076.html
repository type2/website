Bullfrogs.  Every byhand toe setting i've done (either using the
tapemeasure method on fwd wassers, or my nice sliding rod set i made that
works on buses) has been dead on once I could get someone to put it on a
rack.

Camber IS harder, but there are a few good tools designed to help you with
this.  Also, there should be an excellent writeup that Bob Hoover did in
the archives.  

jwwhippedme sells a drive-over alignment tool for around 100$ that
surprisingly actually comes damned close.  Its a bit of a tweek to figure
out how to use, and requires a decent sized level paved area..but a
wallyworld parking lot usually is available.;)  Its not as accurate as i
might like, and reading camber is pretty hard. (only shows /as/ you drive
over it.)

Automotion (a porsche related mailorder co) sells a /nice/ looking
digital camber gauge. www.automotion_dot_com part #TL-2500  Of course, its not
cheap.  239.98 in the catalog i have here.

JCW has a few other options as well, as i recall, though i dont have a
catalog around to reference.


read the hoover bit, and some of these tools will begin to make more
sense.  or fab your own.

later....david
