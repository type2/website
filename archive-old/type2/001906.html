&gt;While it may be true that Cofaps are made by Mahle/Brazil, this would
&gt;surprise me somewhat.  I have at various times obtained p&amp;c sets from Cofap
&gt;and from Mahle/Brazil.  They did not look the same.  The Mahle/Brazil ones
&gt;looked _identical_ to the German Mahles.  You couldn't tell them apart. The
&gt;Cofaps looked just slightly different.  Not notably worse but different
from
&gt;the Brazilian Mahles in small details, as though they were coming from a
&gt;different factory or production run, or made to slightly different specs.


Cofap Brazil parts are Kolbenschmidt Brazil.  However I had heard that they
and
Mahle are one and the same.  Regardless the Cofap are cast in the origional
KS
molds and are done differently than the Mahle just as Ron mentions, but same
as
KS always have been.  KS and Mahle differ as in the way and amount of steel
insert to prevent oblongation of the skirt.  I have no idea which is
superior, the KS
(even the Brazilian) look like better castings, but the Mahle insert design
seems
more sensible.  I was speaking pistons there BTW, the Mahle barrels do seem
cast in finer sand.  Having extensively micced my set of Cofap's they appear
quite
nicely sized, very uniform, etc.  The price on them from NOPI was better
than I
could do anywhwere and I like the 1 piece oil control ring KS uses much,
MUCH,
more than the Mahle 3 piece parts.  Not to slight BD in any way, all the
other
engine parts came from there and prices and quality for all German bearings
(I note even Ron's &quot;cheap&quot; rod bearings appear to be German) were great.

Bottom line don't shy from the Cofap P&amp;C's.  As to German vs South American,
well people will argue it forever, frankly I put the prowess and technical
and
precision might of Germany on even keel with that of say Ford or GM today,
read in that what you will.  Unless current German Mahle are simply leftover
from
a 25 year old production run (which might well be possible) I'd find it hard
to pop
the extra $200, if I got a deal, sure but otherwise, well your T4 cam is
going to be
going by 125k, so why seek out a 200k set of pistons and liners.

Now on the other hand, what I'd easily pay $600 for would be a set of
genuine
old stock German 2nd oversize 95mm liners, or hell maybe even for the
94.5's.
I mean you got to figure they made a pile of those in even a small
production run
and how many really could have ever been sold?  Probably collecting dust and
rust in a warehouse somewhere in the fatherland.
