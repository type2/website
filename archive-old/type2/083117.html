&gt; My take on lifting a bus and keeping off the ground is as follows:

&gt; Ramps - They are nice IF the bus is running.  pushing a dead bus onto
&gt; ramps is the sort of thing I would not wish on my worst enemy (OK, well...
&gt; maybe my *worst* enenmy :-)
&gt;
&gt; Jack stands - I have used  them for years.  Never had a problem with those
&gt; that have *cast* supports.  The ones with a tube-in-tube design with a
&gt; sheet metal saddle are *JUNK* and should be banned!  At the same time,
&gt; John Anderson has had the saddle on a set with cast supports crack on him,
&gt; so the final answer is probably...

I've used the welded sheet metal variety for years with no problems.  They
hold up a full-size Chevy pickup now and then, so a bus is well within
their range

&gt; BUY HIGH QUALITY!  Whatever style you choose, do not scrimp on this, as
&gt; you will be trusting your life to it.  A &quot;lifetime warrantee&quot; does you
&gt; damn all good when it fails and drops the bus on your chest.

Also, never get under a vehicle supported only by one thing (the only
exception being its own wheels).  The finest stands in the world can fail.
If I put one end of my bus up, I'll leave the jack in place as a safety
backup as well as sliding the loose tire under the bus &quot;just in case&quot;
