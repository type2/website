Subject: Re: [T2] whats the easiest way to check if I have a california
  model?

[...]


&gt; I suspect I may have a California model 83 aircooled
&gt; vanagon.  What is the easiest way to check, and also,
&gt; I know the PO put a new engine in there, so how can I
&gt; check to make sure if the smog equipement is
&gt; california then the engine is also?  How hard would it
&gt; be to convert if it is california and what are the
&gt; advantages.  Obviously the parts are easier to find
&gt; for the federal

At a quick glance:
Catalytic converter on a Fed model will be in-line with the muffler. Cal
model, it is in-line with the left heater box.
Fed model has an 11 pin double relay, Cal has a 9 pin.
Fed has resister pack on left side of firewall.
Fed has points in distributor.
Cal has electronic ignition.
Fed has an AFM that ends in part # 025
Cal AFM ends in 030.
