&gt;&gt;Here is a friday question.  When you sleep in your camper, do you find it
&gt;&gt;more comfortable with your head to the front or to the rear?
&gt;&gt;(Forgive me, it's a slow day at work!)

Head pointing rearward, cause I am tall and my bed is short.  With my head at the rear I can hang my feet over the edge.  The other way around, no such luck.  As others have mentioned, it's also very pleasant with the hatch open and the screen in place.
