List,
I have a bite on the tank, but i'm getting a little short of cash and wanted
to see if i can get any more offers in case he backs out.
Don't worry mike - i won't sell without talking to you -i'm just covering my
assests. ;p

I can send pics of this tank. it is removed from the bus and was holding a
full charge of propane.

here is the original post.  Thanks!

List,
The propane tank under my 71 adventurewagen is still holding propane.

The stove, etc was all gone when i got it, so i won't need it.
Not sure if it will fit exactly on later campers - probly wouldn't be much of
a mod if it didn't...just bolts to the floor...

Closest price i can find new is for the 80-91 vanagons and its $285 (!) but i
don't want anywhere near that for this part.
Prior to 1980, i think they're NLA. This was a california bus originally. 
Might have spent the last 10-15 years in the IN area - at least the last five
off the road.

Not looking to 'gouge' anybody, but i am financing a resto (term used
loosely)
on this bus - http://www.angelfire_dot_com/ky/fecesdiary/71.html
No engine, brakes need work, water damage to interior, tranny rebuild...

Just think about the breakfasts you could have...

Hows a hundred bucks sound?
