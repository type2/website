Subject: Re: [T2] Re: auxiliary battery

After going through two deep cycle batteries in 4 years in my boat,I spoke
to a guy at a service station that I went to all the time.He said the key to
battery life is to charge it  after each use and to store it charged.When
you store a battery in a poorly chaged state,sulfates build up on the plates
in the battery leading to an early death.About 5 years ago I found something
called the battery minder.In my opinion this is one of the best things for
battery life I know of.My current trolling motor battery is six years old
and ran my trolling motor and fishfinder almost nonstop for eight hours
tuesday and still was at 12.35 volts.A trolling motor pulls some pretty
serious current(although mine was on the lowest speed most of the time)
Anyway I like this Battery minder so much I bought one for my bus.One of the
things I like most about it is that you hook it up plug it in and forget
about it.It wont fry your battery or overcharge it and boil all the water
out of it.It brings it to a full charge and then maintains it for as long as
its hooked up.Anyway just two cents from someone who didnt like replacing an
80 dollar deepcycle battery every two years....
