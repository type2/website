Subject: JCW Engine Stands?

Now that peer/list pressure made me go public with my age, you can
understand why I don't want to spend another minute in a damp, chilly
basement hunched over an engine sitting on cinderblocks!

So few days ago I was happy to see a request for the catalog number of
the JC Whitney engine stand that bolts to a bench.  But I never saw a
reply and presume it was handled off the list.

My current (?) &quot;Summer Sale&quot; JCW catalog does not list the
engine stand either. Actually, I believe they offer two stands, one
free standing the other bench mounted. I'd be interested in price,
catalog #, and opinions of each. Maybe other listmembers would be
interested as well.

Thanks,

Tom F.
