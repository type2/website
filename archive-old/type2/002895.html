&gt; Sound like ball bearings bouncing around inside the engine?  There are no
ball
&gt; bearings to bounce around but ping, detonation, or mechanical problems
could
&gt; sound like that.

It really doesn't sound like pinging.  Like I said, it sounds like valves
clattering, I assume from a delayed spark at high RPMs, if that's possible.
I can't remember if this was happening with the 009 that was there when I
got the van or not. Besides, if it was pinging, my pistons would be a blob
of molten metal, as many miles as I've driven it like this.  Compression is
as good as the day I got it (~128-130 all the way around) and my oil temps
run a consistent 220 on a normal Florida day around town and never above 250
on the highway.  (except that time the ground for the gauge came off and the
needle was buried past 300, but of course that doesn't count.  Scared the
heck out of me for a minute though :).

&gt;Is the vacuum port on the Weber ported or manifold vacuum?

I'm not sure on that one.  The port is on the bottom of the carb, not on the
manifold, so I assume it is ported vacuum.  Would there be more vacuum at
the manifold?
