Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Steel fuel line connection

Hi Todd,

Wouldn't it be a better idea to put the filter upstream of the pump?

I have two reasons to prefer this:
1.  the filter protects the pump from fuel contamination.
2. A contaminated filter will increase the pressure in the line  
between it and the pump. This increases the chance of a blow-out and  
a nasty fuel leak.

YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; Anyway, I fixed the steel line directly to the bottom of the tank.  
&gt; I don't know how all Busses are, since this is my first Bus. But on  
&gt; the bottom of my tank, there was a fitting. This fitting was made  
&gt; of brass and simply unscrewed. I then had a long length of metal  
&gt; tubing that I got from Discount Auto Parts. It already came with  
&gt; the fittings at both ends. I was able to screw this directly into  
&gt; the bottom of the fuel tank. I then bent the lines using my $5  
&gt; dollar tube bender. I used steel lines all the way from the tank,  
&gt; to the &quot;2nd battery tray area&quot; or whatever you call it. The side  
&gt; opposide of where the battery goes. I bolted my electric fuel pump  
&gt; (a Bug Pak / Purolator 4PSI pump) directly to the floor of the  
&gt; engine compartment, and hooked the steel fuel line directly to  
&gt; that. I THEN took another steel fuel line (shorter, and hooked up  
&gt; the steel line directly from the pump to this glass fuel filter  
&gt; that I have. The glass filter has a steel cap on both ends with one  
&gt; end having threads and the other with a nossle (that you hook a  
&gt; rubber line to).
