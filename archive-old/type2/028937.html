Ok list folks, we'll run a special on '71-'79 axle front axle beams (this
item number 1 on the Front Axle-Axle beam illustration, includes torsion
arms). This will be a used quality (not rusted) beam. Let's do $175 and free
shipping anywhere cont. USA, 30 day guarantee. This is for all type2 list
folks except for Dustin Fitch he gets one for $135 . '68-'70 please call.
Limited to stock on hand. I'm not going to rip into my parked buses, so give
us a call if you have any questions comments or concerns.

I've been looking for a good clean 78 front beam..where are you located,
what would it cost to ship one to Maryland???

&gt; We have several rust free used ones. I haven't sold one in a while. They
&gt; will ship UPS reasonably. They sell for more locally but considering
&gt; shipping and the nature of the situation we'll do $100 plus shipping
(about
&gt; $35) to Mass. Give me a call next payday and take the municiple bus for a
&gt; while.

&gt; 	Tell me that story scares the excrement out of somebody other than
&gt; me!  With the sheer weight of the vehicle over that beam, after the first
&gt; look I'd 've parked it.  What's the best way to avoid this in the future?
&gt; Powder coating?  POR? Eastwood rust preventative(header coating)?  I'm in
&gt; California, but you never know when you might R&amp;R the thing anyway.

&gt;   I was backing out of my driveway, a day
&gt; after this started, and as I went from the dirt part of my driveway up the
&gt; ridge and onto the road, I had my foot gently on the brake pedal as I
rolled
&gt; out...and as the front tires went up over the little curb to back out onto
&gt; the road, I felt the brake pedal come *up* also as the tires rolled over
the
&gt; curb.
