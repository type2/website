&gt; &gt;This 2.0 case should be true, but I will have it checked, and align-bored,
&gt; &gt;if need be. I hear that over-sized bearings for the type 2/4 mains are few
&gt; &gt;and far between. Thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; Why bother?  The mains are way over-engineered as-is.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I will start with a counter-weighted crank, and have all of the
&gt; &gt;rotating/reciprocating mass in the motor absolute-zero balanced. I will
&gt; &gt;have the flywheel lightened, as the added mass in the crank counter-weights
&gt; &gt;will more than offset any harmonic wobble, and create adequate mass for a
&gt; &gt;smooth idle. Thoughts on how much to have shaved off the flywheel?
&gt; 
&gt; None.  There is no reason to lighten the flywheel.  First of all, the mass
&gt; added to your crank has a very short radius, and is not going to have much
&gt; effect on anything.  Second, the flywheel mass is not there for a smooth
&gt; idle, it's there to help you pull away from a light without killing the
&gt; engine.  In the case of a bus, more is better, within reason.  More mass
&gt; will slow your rate of acceleration slightly but based on my experience I
&gt; can tell you that it will not be noticable.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Next, I would like to go with a set of NPR 96mm flat-top pistons. I built a
&gt; &gt;couple sets in a 914's (one of which was mine), and loved them. I am a
&gt; &gt;little concerned about their ability to shed the heat that pushing the
&gt; &gt;Westy could create. Thoughts? Anybody run a set of these in a 1976-1983 Van
&gt; &gt;or Westy? Any problems? Anyone have a set of NOS NPR 96's for a 2.0 for
&gt; &gt;less than $300? Will probably have the pistons polished. Is this worth it?
&gt; &gt;Does this reduce friction, reduce predetonation? By the way, the pistons
&gt; &gt;that are coming out of the motor have less than 20k on them. They are
&gt; &gt;genuine VW. Are they worth anything?
&gt; 
&gt; My only experience with 96mm pistons is that there was a set in my bus when
&gt; I bought it, and one of them had a hole in it.  From a reliability
&gt; standpoint I would say stay away from them - they can't be more reliable
&gt; than 94mm ones.  However if you still want to pursue them, I got an e-mail
&gt; from a guy recently telling me about a coating you can have applied to the
&gt; outside of the cylinders to increase heat dissipation.  Sounded really
&gt; interesting.  If that person would like to comment, that would be great,
&gt; otherwise let me know if you're interested and I'll dig out the e-mail.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the flat top pistons, without that 15cc dish you will need to be
&gt; careful of your compression ratio.  If you are really going to drive as you
&gt; describe I would stay under 7.5.
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose of polishing the pistons and combustion chamber is 1) to resist
&gt; the buildup of deposits, and 2) to eliminate sharp edges which can cause
&gt; detonation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I would like to have some bigger valves in the heads, and have the
&gt; &gt;combustion spaces polished. How much bigger can the valves be without
&gt; &gt;swapping RELIABLY for performance? Is it too risky? Seems like respiration
&gt; &gt;is a rich lode of improvement for the type 2/4, but I don't want problems,
&gt; &gt;either.
&gt; 
&gt; You can easily go to 41mm intake valves, and (I think) 34mm exhausts.
&gt; Those are the &quot;1800&quot; or 1974 sizes.  Of course, the larger the valve, the
&gt; more problem you have with shrouding.  There's a question of how big a
&gt; valve you actually need - there is a point of diminishing returns, and my
&gt; *opinion* at this point is that it's a lot smaller than most people
&gt; believe.  I have 41's in my engine now, and I didn't notice any increase in
&gt; performance versus the smaller valves I had before that.  But then I have
&gt; tiny carbs.  VW chose to go really small on their FI 2-liter engine's
&gt; valves - can't remember but it's something like 37 or 38mm.  I'm sure they
&gt; had a reason for doing this - it was probably for increased velocity which
&gt; improves low-end torque.  My next set of heads (already got them from MSHP)
&gt; have the 1700 sized valves, which are a step down in size, and I expect
&gt; improved performance.  The bottom line is that unless you are going to
&gt; install some big carbs and manifolds on your engine and have the ports
&gt; seriously worked over, I wouldn't bother with bigger valves.  From a
&gt; reliability standpoint I don't think there is any difference, but
&gt; increasing the valve size without working over the rest of the intake will
&gt; just hurt power production.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The motor will have a oil-pressure boost springs, a Melling high-capacity
&gt; &gt;oil pump, an oil thermostat, and an auxiliary oil cooler mounted up front
&gt; &gt;behind the stock grill.
&gt; 
&gt; I had the Mellling pump, didn't notice a huge improvement, but I guess it
&gt; didn't hurt anything either.  Might have helped a little, and it was cheap.
&gt;  You will need the aux. oil cooler.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Finally, assuming that I have done all of the above, is it worth it to add
&gt; &gt;higher-ratio rocker arms? Seems like it would be. I can't think of any
&gt; &gt;reliability issues that those could influence. Thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; The rocker arm studs are not that strong, and higher ratio rockers would
&gt; just put more stress on them.  It also puts more stress on the cam, which
&gt; already has a problem with wear.  It also lowers your maximum rpm before
&gt; valve float, but that may or may not be a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want more power with no hit to reliability, I would stay away from
&gt; gimmicky things like high ratio rocker arms and go for a 2.2l stroker engine.

David:
I agree with most everything you said, but a few remarks:
1. I agree that lightening a flywheel will make you need to be more
careful letting out the clutch, however, once that clutch is out
(provided the engine is still running) a lighter flywheel will help a
lot. I installed an aluminum wheel on my 1960 Corvette-283, Rochester
FI, 10/1 pistons, mild H-268 degree cam- higher, quicker lift. The cam
and the wheel were the only substantive changes. WOW, what a difference!
I can remember driving this thing in 1969 and having a lot of trouble
passing people on 2-lane roads- no more! I think the lighter wheel was
the biggest change.
HOWEVER! Is this Westy a sports car or a truck? Right now it's set up
like a truck. I think Matthew could be quite happy taking something off
the flywheel. I don't think he could accomplish the percentage reduction 
that I did with my Corvette(stock probably was 24 lbs, now maybe 12
lbs), nor would he be happy with that light of a wheel.(Ever drive a 2.0
911s with carbs? Pretty glorious AFTER you got the clutch out)
2. Stroker: good idea, no downside except expense.
3. High ratio rockers, not too bad, I'm sure they will reduce cam life
some, but is this a BIG problem in stock setup? I've seen many cams that
I wouldn't reuse, but many that were just fine.
4. 96mm NPR's If you can find them, I'd go for it. My experience was all
good. Be careful of overall c/r though. 7.5 or 7.6 MAX!!
5. I think I'd go with 41 and 34mm valves. Original equipment type
valves are much better in my estimation than any stainless steel types.
6. I'd NOT want any larger oil pump, higher pressure springs. If you're
driving through the desert, then maybe auxilliary oil cooler, but must
be temp controlled. I built a lot of street driven Chevys with big oil
pumps that leaked oil before I came to appreciate how good the factory
ones were: Had small pumps, didn't leak oil, still stayed alive okay.
7. I think to get much more HP you're going to need a bigger induction
system. Maybe modify 2.1 Vanagon parts to work. They are 90-100 HP
range.
