&gt;1. can you get away with using the 1700 carb system on an 1800 block, not
&gt;driving to california, just to maybe get through the inspection;

Yes.

&gt;3. are there clutch compatability issues between the 1700 and 1800? In other
&gt;words, should I stick the 72 clutch on the 74 block when using it in a 72 bus?

The flywheel, clutch, and pressure plate are different, but interchangeable 
as a set between the 72 and 74 engines and transaxles.  I would use the 74 
parts as they are a little larger.  Don't forget to check endplay.
