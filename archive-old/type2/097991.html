Subject: faulty new condensor?

After replacing points and condensor (bosch), my bus
is barely running.
I set the dwell and timed it statically. And for the
first 10 miles, it was running *very* well.

Suddenly, it started missing and lost power. I can get
it to run, but it dies.

I've checked and the dwell still is right on and the
timing is where I timed it. (I just got a timing
light, but i can't use it until i get the bus running
again.)

Is it possible I got a defective condensor? I'll pull
the distributor and put the old condensor back in if
necessary to find the problem.
