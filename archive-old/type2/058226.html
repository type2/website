First, what type of temp. sender are you using and where is it located?  I
used to use a lame t-adapter on the pressure switch hole that would give a
very accurate temperature reading of the engine case and the air passing
around it, but not the oil.  It would be wildly effected by outside air
temperature.

Second, I would expect the oil to cool off a bit when you stop for gas.  If
you were driving gently, it might even take 20 minutes to get back up to
temperature.  This is normal.

If the temperature reading really went up 20 degrees in sixty seconds after
the engine compartment was closed, as you say it did, you might have
something completely blocking the air flow from the vents up top.  I'd take
a look if I were you.

&gt;Was driving back from BBTA yesterday and after a stop for gas I had
&gt;inadvertently left my rear engine door open.  Oil temp gauge read 20
&gt;degrees cooler for about 20 minutes and then went over a bump, engine door
&gt;shuts, and within a minute gauge reads 20 degrees higher.
