Subject: Re: [T2] 27x8.5x14 BFGoodrich tires

I have them on my '78 Westy, and they fit fine and look great.  I still have 
suspension problems somewhere, so I can't be a good source on how well they 
handle, but they kick butt in the snow.  They increase your gear ratios, so 
hills are harder to go up, but they do well on the highway, and have been 
very quiet so far.  Hope this helps!

&gt;I have a question about 27x8.5x14 BFGoodrich AllTerrain tires. Will they 
&gt;fit
&gt;to 1975 Westy without any body or suspension modificaton? I just &quot;checked&quot;
&gt;clearance and it looks they will fit but I need confirmation before I spend
&gt;$...
&gt;Thanks
