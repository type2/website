Subject: Progressive weber and vacuum booster
Date: Mon, 27 Nov 2000 16:30:22 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I posted this q a while back but got no response, so here goes again:  I
have a single progressive Weber with a vacuum port in the manifold, but when
I connect the booster it sucks the brake pedal to the floor and jams on all
the brakes.  Anyone got a clue what's causing this and how to remedy it?

TIA

&gt; &gt; Somebody must know of a way to add a vacuum port to one of the manifolds

&gt; And somebody replied:
&gt; &gt; Just go to the hardware store, buy a hose barb ...
&gt; &gt; ...attach the booster hose, and you are set.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Okay, what about all of us poor slobs with progressive setups? It seems
&gt; that one of the main drawbacks of the progressive is the lack of vaccum
&gt; ports.  Where would be a good place to put the tap for the booster hose on
&gt; this particular setup's manifold... or does it matter?  IIRC, fluid
&gt; dynamics tells us that closed system pressure (or vaccum) is uniform
&gt; throughout the fluid system.  When there's vaccum happening, the system
&gt; should be closed.
&gt;
&gt; Also, could the manifold be tapped to hook up a vaccum advance for a
&gt; dizzy?  Everything I've read says that if you use a progressive, you're
&gt; cursed with the 009. Where'd be a good place for that kinda vaccum tap?
