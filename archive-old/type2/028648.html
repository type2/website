If you go to the type2 library.
Read the &quot;tires for our buses.&quot;

I also read some where around there
that a 50 psi tire led to a nasty accident.

If you visualize it, the tire becomes less
forgiving. I have a 79, and there's only 2200 lbs
on the front tires. The shock from Cracks, bumps
and pot holes will be multiplied. If you really
want them put some 205/70 r14's on the back at 50
psi for the extra load. That'll be cool.
And in the front, do the 195/75 r14.
It'll look a little Porsche like except for the
van part.

Volks,
   I know we have talked about this before, but I
would like for you to
reply to me as I am in the market for new tires
for my '79 bus. I am looking
the best brand to buy. I am looking at 195/75 R14,
Lt truck tire with a &quot;D&quot;
rating and  can handle at least up to 50 psi. I
would like feedback on what
you feel is the best manufacture and any pro and
cons. Any information will
be greatly appreciated.
