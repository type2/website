Anyone got a rpm limiting rotor? 
Looking for a 5400 or 5800 rev limiting rotor. Does anyone have one
they'd like to sell? 
These are truely hard to find. As far as I know they are NLA. The
trouble is that it is a part that wears out, so there are even fewer of
these than anything else. 
I found one on *-bay some time ago for about $30 bucks. I haven't seen
one lately though. I put it on when my wife drives the bus, as she is
not very good with a stick yet, but is learning. I am unfortunately for
you, not interested in parting with it. 
Good luck finding one. If you find a reliable source, I am sure that
many of us would love to know about it. THough you may want to order
yourself a bunch before telling us. ;)
