Subject: Re:  [T2] Bus broken into last night

Unfortunately my first posting to the group will be to chime in with a
similar story.
They broke into my 78 Transporter (as well as a few other cars) three weeks
ago.  They forced the passengers vent window, tore a hole through the
cardboard glove box and stole the two year old Pioneer cd player.  They
stole my tool bag which had a set of KC HiLites and a set of Bosch Fog
lights that were waiting to be installed. I had fortunately already taken my
OBD reader out of the tool bag before I put it in the bus.
It really put a damper on my new VW project but I am already looking for a
roof rack as a future project after I get the next stereo installed.

I call her the &quot;Sweet Potato&quot; on account of her being brown on the bottom
half and orange on the top half.  I got her as a wedding gift from a very
nice neighbour. She needed a battery and has been running strong ever since.
Well after I sorted out some vacuum lines and the constant gasoline leak
from the fuel lines.  No joke, there was a puddle under it when I first
added a jug of gas.
