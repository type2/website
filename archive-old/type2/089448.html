Hi Richard,

    About the last thing you will have to worry about would be point =
bounce. Unless your spinning your engine up to about 10,000 RPM'S.  The =
reason being, point bounce occurs when the engine reaches a high enough =
RPM that the spring on the points arm can't keep the rubbing block in =
contact with the distributor cam.
    I guess it could happen, but unlikely. By the way about a hundred =
years ago when I used to do some Chevro** let drag racing (before Excel =
High Performance points and the like) we used to install an extra spring =
on our points to prevent this from happening.
    See ya.
