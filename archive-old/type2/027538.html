I agree with William on the tire pressure issue. If you run at 30/40 with no 
extra gear on board that adds weight, you'll find the center of the tread 
wears much faster than the edges. On the trade-off, I'd take even wear/ride 
comfort-control to fuel economy. The cost of replacing unevenly worn tires 
is not insignificant; and the carcasses are an environmental pollutant too. 
So I run Michelin R's at 26/34, unless I'm loaded for travel.
