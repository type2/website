Hi All,

Just a quick update on my 74.  Got an engine in it last
summer, got it thru CA Smog, a bit of a hassle.  Been
learning more about painting than I ever wanted to learn.
Bought a hvlp gun (high volume low pressure) from jcwhipme,
borrowed my dad compresser and went for it.  Lesson
learned (after much wet sanding to remove my mistakes!) for me in last few months has been that I was
shooting it too thick.  Thinned it way down 3:1:1 and
that solved about 90 percent of my problems. Been use POR-15
sparingly for any surface rust, pretty satisfied with it. Brakes, shocks next money/time permitting.

Happy bussin.

David.
