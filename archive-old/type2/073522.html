Subject: Eberspacher heater for sale
Message-Id: &lt;v04210109b443fa63e046_at_[216.64.6.66]&gt;

Hey folks,

I bought a heater for my bus a few years ago, then decided to store 
my bus in winters, and have never put it in.  I can't remember if it 
is a BA4 or a BA6, but if anyone is interested, I will dig it out.  I 
sent away to Eberspacher for the manual and have it for anyone who is 
interested.  I can't vouch for the heater, I have never plugged it 
in, but it looks good and is very clean, no rust or anything.  I 
would have sent it away to someone (do I remember correctly the name 
of Ark Marvin in NJ?) if I was going to use it.  I have no idea how 
much these are worth, I'm thinking $350, tell me if I have used too 
many solvents in my life.
