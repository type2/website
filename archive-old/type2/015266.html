hey gang.
I have been running an 009 in my 1600DP for a while (other than that, the
engine is stock)( I have given up my Pertronix/Compufire quest)  my question:

Went to my FLAPS in dire need of a point set. He gave me part number 01
011, said he uses it all the time in 009's (he is an import mechanic) The
number didn't sound right, so I looked up in RMMW catalog and Mid America
catalog they both said the part number for a point set for a 009 is 01 030.
Called the guy at FLAPS back, told him of my brillant discovery, he said
don't worry 01 011 would work. I live in hickville USA and he is the only
guy for 50 miles that carries ANY Bosch ignition parts. 

Will this point set work at all?
Is my FLAPS guy a close friend of rasdave? (suuure it will work dude.. one
love man.)
;-0~

Thanks everyone. Happy Friday.
