I bought a new starter for my 79 Bus.  It's fuel injected and the old 
starter has 2 push on prongs on it. (the one for the ignition and the one 
for the FI).....My question is, the new starter only has one push on 
terminal, can I just connect both the ignition and FI wires to this one post 
(with some 1-&gt;2 prong type adaptor).....or is the starter completely 
wrong.....On the old starter these two posts seem to be connected 
anyway......I couldn't really find anything in the archives,
only for teh opposite, when there is an extra prong.

thanks
