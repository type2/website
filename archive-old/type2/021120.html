For you finger shakers out there, consider Ron's own last words in a
post to the list on how he got the money to start the Bus Depot by
buying Ca busses from want ads and shipping them east- not once was he
ripped off.
....&quot;The experience gave me a real respect for the overall honesty and
enthusiasm of the VW bus community (a
respect which has only been reinforced by my dealings with customers of
The Bus Depot).  I found that I really enjoyed dealing with VW owners,
and that generally they were good people, and of a kindred spirit so to
speak.
That positive experience was what made me decide that I could be very
happy dealing with people like that from then on, and encouraged me to
start The Bus Depot.&quot;
