&gt; Just got back from tire shopping. Was all set to order Yokohama
370's when
&gt; the salesman, who seemed to know what he was talking about,
suggested I
&gt; consider the Cooper Model SRM11. The tire specifications are 185R14,
load
&gt; range D, max load 1875, inflation pressure 65. As I have not seen
this tire
&gt; mentioned on the list, has anyone ever used or have an opinion about
it. The
&gt; salesperson said it has a slightly softer ride and better traction
in wet
&gt; weather than the Yoko's (meaning he may get a higher commission as I
doubt
&gt; he has ever used either)

I agree with your thought here.  You might be able to feel a
difference, but unless you drive a bus regularly you won't be able to
predict it very well.

Cooper has a nice website with lots of info:

It's interesting that they also list a 195R14, a size I haven't seen
before in a tall height/width ratio.  This might be an option for
those attempting to get back to the rolling radius of the original
bias-ply tires.
