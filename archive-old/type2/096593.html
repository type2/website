Subject: Re: Broken Easy Out

Further to this, I have used carbide Dremel bits ground (diamond grinding
wheel) into a spade drill shape (flat with a wide angle between the
cutting edges-look at a concrete drill)  Used in a RIGID drill press (mill
is better) with HEAVY CONSTANT pressure these will go through taps/easy
outs and most fubars. Usually surprisingly easily.  Buy a few as they are
inexpensive and somewhat brittle.  Shown to me by a very knowledgeable
machinist/teacher after I had broken a tap at the end of a long and
complex machining operation.  Much better than slitting your wrists and
lots cheaper than EDM.

ps 99% of the time the tap/easy out is not broken with torque but with
leverage  i.e. bending strain. j

snip)
I, too broke off a screw extractor in a 6mm tin screw in 
a cylinder head.  I tried the same thing you did, only 
succeeded in ruining the cobalt drill bit.  My wonderful 
wife suggested a fine point diamond dremel bit.  I did 
that (the diamond bit wasn't cheap) and ground out the 
tip of the screw extractor and finally removed the 
broken off screw with a left-hand twist drill bit like 
Steve Dolan suggested.  Learned a lesson on that one...

Hope this works.
