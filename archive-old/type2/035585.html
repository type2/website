Uh oh, CaptainCliff!

You may have stripped the little gears (plastic!!!) in the wiper motor box.
I had a problem which sounds similar to this one and wound up having to
replace the wiper motor :-( . The wipers moved okay as long as there was no
resistance but the minute they were back on the windshield they wouldn't
budge. That was no fun. I hope this isn't the case but you really ought to
pull the little motor and check to see if this hasn't happened.
