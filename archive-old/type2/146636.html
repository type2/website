Subject: Chaos theory and air cooled engines

AT last, the mysterious loss of power on hills/high speed after fitting 
a new fuel pump explained. Silly me. And I thought it was buying the 
wrong pump, or a worn rod, or just plain stupidity putting it back 
together. No, here's what happened..  To make access easier I removed 
the distributor. Which was a bit stiff. So I persuaded it with a rubber 
mallet. Which caused the problem, because......the vibrations knocked 
loose my pertronix ignitor. Which then worked very nicely at idle, but 
under high load jiggled about so much all spark was lost.

So after 3 days head scratching, does anyone else have any similar 
examples of the butterfly effect to tell? I'm particularly interested in 
the new parts/bits that were fitted, and seemed to kill your bus until 
you realised what had happened.
