&gt; Is there an easy way to VISUALLY tell the difference between a 78 and
&gt; 79?  I know they have different exhausts, but is it an apparent
&gt; difference?  There is a bus I'm purchasing and it's a 78 and I just want
&gt; to make sure it's not a 79 engine.

You can see the exhaust ports by lying underneath the engine with a
flathead screwdriver and a flashlight. Remove 2 screws on the piece of tin
concealing the cylinders on one side or the other. Look up to where the
exhaust manifolds attach to the heads. They will be clearly visible then.
Put the tin back and rescrew. 5 minutes will do it.

Isn't there also a date inscribed on a little plate on the driver's side
door post, or on the outside of the driver's side door where the little
Westfalia factory plaque is?

I had a '78 and a '79 in CA and as I recall, my '78 had an EGR
recirculation syustem, and my '79 did not. So looking into the engine bay,
I would see a prominent silver colored 14&quot; long exhaust recirc pipe
attaching to a boxy looking recirc valve on the plenum on the driver's
side in the '78 and would see no such thing in the '79.

You actual mileage may vary. Looking at the exhaust ports might be your
best way to confirm.
