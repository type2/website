Subject: Tow Bar

Help!  Someone on the list a couple of weeks ago, talked about getting a bus
tow-bar from All-Bug in Az.  I ordered one and have it in my driveway
under my camper bus but there seems to be problems with it.  (1) the verticle
upright angle bars that should slip around the axel beam, will not, because
the brake booster is within about 1/2&quot; of the axel on the driver's side and
is mounted to a bracket that is welded to that axel.  (2) on the passenger 
side, it may slip over the axel beam, but it is a very tight fit.  So tight
that I cannot push it on, but perhaps could force it on with a hammer.  Even
then, it looks like it might hit the steering damper shock absorber.
Am I doing something wrong??  I tried to get info from the archives but they
must be 'down' because could not link to them.  I am ready to tow this bus to
the painter and am looking for some help perhaps who posted the info about
the tow bar.  Thanks.
                                               Bill &amp; Janyce
