Subject: Oil leaks

I am brand new to this list and am hoping to tap into your expertise.  I am 
the new(6 months) owner of an 82 Westy...I love it!!
I just replaced the valve cover gaskets and the driver's side is leaking.  I 
have another gasket but was wondering if anyone knows of any tricks for 
preventing a repeat leak.
It also appears that my oil cooler is leaking.  I have the two gasket for 
that but am not sure if that is a simple fix or not...any thoughts?
Thanks,
Coop
