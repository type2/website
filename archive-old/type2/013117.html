Stan Wilder needs the cover for a rear removable cushion in an 80-87
Westfalia Camper.
I just need the OEM cover for the loose cushion that has the long zipper.
Prefer something that will match the gold/houndstooth interior in GL
models.
Also need OEM matching fabric for the fold down rear seat or the actual
covers that staple to the wood frames.
Fading and removable stains are acceptable.

Please skip the list when responding.
