Subject: RE: [T2] fuel filter / pressure regulator placement

The best change I've made to my '71, besides electronic pointless
ignition, was the addition of an electronic fuel pump and all metal fuel
line from the carb thru the front tin.

I soldered a pipe fitting, using high strength silver solder, on to the
brass tube coming out of the carb (did this while the tube was removed)
and added a clamp arrangement to hold the brass tube in carburetor top.
Then I shaped some metal gas line to the engine while it was out of the
car so there was no chance of it rubbing. Routed it up by the the coil
and down the front side of the motor through the regular fuel line hole
in the front tin. Then I install the fuel filter and electronic fuel
pump under the car in front of the engine away from the heat and now I
no longer worry about gas leaks and the bus going up in flames.

Even the best stock fuel line is not good for very long before it
cracks. I replaced mine often but still found one time after messing
with the distributor I had developed a small gas leak (like there's such
thing as a small gas leak on a VW) and decided that the stock lines had
to go. This mod is going on 8yrs/60K miles without a hitch.
