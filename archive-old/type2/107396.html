Subject: [T2] T2 - 1982 Vanagon 1588cc Air Cooled - Air Filter System -

Richard,

Most of the people on the list are in the U.S. and they have never seen the
1600cc Vanagon engine ... I have once owned a double cab with that engine
but only for a few weeks and I do not think that I even touched the air
filter housing during that time. Now, the references to Haynes will not help
much either as they are European and U.S. editions of the Haynes manual.

Do you have all the parts you need? I seem to remember that you complained
about not having the correct upper housing earlier. I will be in Europe at
the end of May and I may be able to get you the right housing from a friend
in Germany if you can supply me with a part number. However, you should be
able to find these in abundance in the local scrap yards and I am sure that
the air filters outlive these lousy engines.

From: &quot;Thewlis, Richard   N&quot;

There is also the small matter of the vacuum hose from the throttle damper
to the carb' not having a delay valve (if this is indeed, a small matter).
Can I do without this delay valve or can I devise my own invention.  As I
say the engine sounds fine but I am sure that my set up, which detracts
considerably from the set up shown in the Haynes manual, (pg 63) will result
in poor efficiency.  Can anyone shed more light?
