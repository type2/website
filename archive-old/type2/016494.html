Subject: WTB: Spring Plate Alignment Gauge

Want to buy alignment/level/angle gauge similar to item shown in
Bentley's guide.

I do not want to pay a lot for that-a muffler (Opps, alignemnt tool)

Pleeeeeese, no Sears carpenter's gauge/level need apply.

Background: I went to -3- very respectable VW repair shops in northern
Virginia.  I saw one home made gauge, and one Sears gauge, and one
unknown.

Prices (and comments) for the spring plate alignment ran from (worse to
better) - 

     $200 - and you have to leave the VW for two days.  It may not take
two days to do the job, but I may need to do other jobs before you.

    $145 - I can do it in a day.  This is the top price, it may be lower
depending on the work.

    $125 - $150 - (price was mumbled)  It usallly takes about 3 hours,
but I never did one on a model as new (1978 Westy) as yours.  Bring it
over at your convenience and I will look at the VW and better be able to
price it out. 

So, if I can get a good gauge (even a loaner!!), I will tahe the '78 to
the auto hobby shop, loosen &amp; retignten the 4x2 rear wheel bearing
housing bolts with an impact wrench, take it home, and have only one
major problem to work on.

TIA
