I just purchased a 1978 VW Automatic Transporter. The thing is in pretty
good shape with only 129,000 miles. I have a small tranny leak that I'll be
having repaired here later this week.

My question is regarding general maintainance. What the best type of oil to
us in the 2000cc engine? What other things should be looked at on a regular
basis? Any information would be helpful. Thanks!

Oh, btw, my sunroof is leaking as well. Where's the best place to get a seal
for that? And how tough is it to install?

Rollin' On...
