Subject: Gas tank venting

I have a 72 with 1800/FI from a 75.
I recently replaced fuel pump.
This fixed my power loss at high rpm but I have had a sneaking suspicion =
that there was a more basic reason for the old fuel pump failing.
When I put the  new pump in and fired it up it was doing the same thing =
the old one was so I pulled all my lines and made sure they were clear, =
also drained tank.
I put lines back on and voila, new pump sounds and acts new until =
today(2 weeks after job) when my &amp;^%$#$%$_at_ problem returned. This is my =
suspicion.
When I put the 75 fuel tank in , the filler tube vent on the 72 had no =
place to hook up so I mistakenly assumed it would be OK to plug it with =
silicone, to keep spillage from flowing into tank cavity on hard left =
turns.
When I checked the silicone a few weeks later I saw that it was swelling =
out of the tube and ready to fall into the tank.I removed it as best I =
could and asked around for a good product to plug this and was told =
Sealall would work so I used it with apparent success. Now that my tank =
is exibiting symptoms of having a chunky in it that intermittenty  =
obstructs my inlet, I looked at my vent and found no Sealall on it but =
more silicone sticking out.
I think the remaining silicone forced my Sealall &quot;plug&quot; out into filler =
tube.
Needless to say I am in process of removing tank for inspection and =
cleaning .
My question is: Can anyone suggest an acceptable way to plug this vent?
I thought I would try a dust plug glued in but I wonder about the =
vaccuum effect of the fuel level dropping  pulling the plug out and =
putting back where I started.
Exasperating!!!!!!
Thank you in advance=20
