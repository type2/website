Subject: Re: [T2] Removing the rear axle nut

I haunt the local Harbor Freight and do not recommend the 21 PC. 3/4'' DRIVE
HEAVY DUTY METRIC SOCKET SET for removing the rear axle nut on a bus. The
3/4&quot; drive &quot;T&quot; slide bar sold by Sears is much stronger (larger diameter
shaft). The Harbor Freight set may be worth the price just for the sockets
alone but the slide bar is not particularly sturdy.

Also, 1-7/16&quot; and 1-13/16&quot; sockets are so close to the metric 36 and 46 mm
sizes you will never notice a difference.

Anyone considering a hydraulic press might consider the 20 ton ($159 on
sale) rather than the 12 ton. I have the 20 ton and it was barely able to
press the steering link off the ball joint shaft when I replaced the ball
joint boots. I don't believe even the 20 ton would remove ball joints.

Also, similar to Sears, Harbor Freight has always replaced or refunded for
anything I was unhappy with.

&gt; &gt;large metric sockets:
&gt; &gt;http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=5494
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;hydraulic press:
&gt; &gt;http://www.harborfreight_dot_com/cpi/ctaf/Displayitem.taf?itemnumber=1667
&gt;
&gt; And then there is the Sears SAE equivalent that seems to fit pretty good.
1
&gt; &amp; 13/16&quot; = $20. Remember you pay shipping sometimes with mail
&gt; order.  Metric would be better of course. I do think my Sears socket came
&gt; with the lifetime warranty. Much easier to use when it is over-the-counter
&gt; vs. mail order.
