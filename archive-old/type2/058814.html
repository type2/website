Hi All,
	I recently got what I hope was a great deal on a complete 1800 engine. I'm
looking to beg or borrow an approrriate clutch housing to start it before I
even think about switching out my strong but very leaky 1700 (weber prog/009).
Any one in the East TN, SW VA, W NC got a dead small IRS trans? All I need is
a way to mount the starter. Also if anyone has any words of wisdom on starting
a disenbodied engine I'd sure appreciate hearing from you. I tried the
Archive, but really wasn't sure how to word my search. Does anyone remember a
thread on this?			
								TIA, Rob, '73 Westy
