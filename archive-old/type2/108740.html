Subject: gas tank sending unit

Thanks for the continued support on my project.  I appreciate all of your
responses to my questions!

I have the gas tank out. '78 westy.  When I brought the bus home the gauge did
not work. the PO just wrote down the mileage.  However the sending unit looks
to be brand new.  There is a hole cut above it in the body which permits
access, I am assuming that someone has already replace it.

so before I install the tank, how do I test the sending unit?  I have tired
the recommendations from the manuals. (T1 whatever that means)and get the same
reading whether the tank is right side up or upside down( I can hear the float
flop up and down when I turn it over to test)  I don't want to do this twice!
tank looks to be in excellent condition also.

thanks in advance!
