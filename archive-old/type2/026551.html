Subject: 5sp tranny conversion - status report

Well, like most of my projects these days, this one is taking a lot longer
than expected.  Everything looks fairly straight forward with installing the
901 5sp transmission in my 73 Westy.  The tranny mounts will be easy to
design and should supply more than enough support and the engine bolts right
up to it.  The shift rod will need to be significantly modified, but I've
got some notes from an old article on what needs to be done.

But I did run into a snag that set me back a week.  The tranny I had was
&gt;from a 1970 Porsche 911.  Bad move.  Porsche switched to a different style
clutch for the 1970 - 197? years.  And they are NOT compatible with the 914
style clutch, shiftfork, TO bearing, and flywheel that must be used for the
conversion.  I couldn't locate a pre-70 tranny on short notice so I did the
next best thing.  I got a trashed 914 tranny and swapped the gear cluster
and differential from the 911 tranny into it.  Now I've got a tranny I can
use.  Anyone planning to do this should look for a 5-speed 901 tranny from a
1965 - 1969 911 and save yourself the headache that I had to deal with.

Hopefully this next weekend will see the engine/tranny installed in the bus
so I can work on the shift rod modifications.  Then I still have to sort out
the Bosch d-Jet FI and I'll be on the road again.  Just in time for BBtA!

I'll keep ya'll posted...
