The first pair of #s is lower paint (in 1968 to 1970 transpoters the 
dividing line is the rain gutter i.e. only the roof would be painted 
another color and it would always be 61 which is L581 , Wolkenweiﬂ 
	(cloud white) 1971 model started the beltline as the 
divinging line for two tone paint. Ususally Pastelweis was the upper 
color.On kombis upper and lower were usually the same.

The last pair of #s is the interior code. 68 to 70 had some 
interesting interiors. As time went on passenger buses were usually 
saddled with simple black interiors .

4747..	L50K	neptunblau	(neptune blue)
35	leatherette	dunkelblau	dark blu

&gt;Hiya All
&gt;
&gt;I'm trying to find out the original colour of my 1968 bay, but I can't seem
&gt;to find the paint codes referenced anywhere.
