ok...here goes..
I replaced the condenser (with a bit of encouragement and a razor blade)
the ignition coil (Wells liquid filled) the spark plugs ( Bosch non
resistor) and cleaned up the distributor and rotor, put gas in, checked
all of my connections...and still no go..
I can't get the old points out cause the screw head is stripped... they
look kinda crusty though...could this be the problem?? I have new points
ready to go but...
Everything seems like its ready to go....but it really doesn't have that
strong of a spark... enough to start though...
I do smell gas when I try to start it though...in the engine compartment
that is.. but no go... it sounds like its about to start...but it just
won't run..
Whats my problem???  I'm thinking about replacing the spark plug wires
cause I get paid today...

I got the emblem off... it was half off already... I just need the
little plastic things that go over the metal knobs on the emblem so that
I can stick it back in place....anybody have any of these mounts?? know
what they're called?? or where I can get them??  I know its not really
important...but a bus neeeeeeeds the emblem...gives it character...
without it... she has no face...no expression..you know what I mean.

ok...so any help is greatly appreciated!
