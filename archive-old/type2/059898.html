Subject: Re: Type I Engine Pull, frozen pilot bearing?

&gt;Be careful with prying the engine off of the tranny.  The input shaft
&gt;of the transmission isn't all that strongly attached, and if you
&gt;manage to pull it out of the tranmission it'll compound your headache!

I understand there's nothing but a circlip holding it? Is that right?
Tonight that circlip withstood me and Joe prying on the moustache bar,
wedging against the frame members, me with a 5-foot pipe and him with a
crowbar. Nothing gave though.

I don't think the engine is coming out. 8) Bear in mind that I am cluless,
it looks like there are two choices:

	-- dismantle the engine from around the crank, ending up with a
transaxle with a flywheel, gland nut and crankshaft welded to the end of
it. I don't know what I would do with such a thing, it won't even burn. 8)

	-- try to take the differential out of the trans, detach the shaft,
and end up with an engine with a trans shaft welded to it. Start cutting
the clutch off then? I dunno. From Joe's Bentley it looks as if this
approach is do-able but even if it is, it probably won't be obvious what is
stuck to what.

I am able to get something over 1/2&quot; of separation between then engine and
trans now. Intelligent people have discouraged me from prying with metal
tools. I have tried hammering long, thin wedges of white oak between the
engine case and the bell housing but there's not enough purchase. I can't
wedge up into the bellhousing because the flywheel is in the way.

If I can get another body here tomorrow we'll try your way of moving the
crank but I am not optimistic. Any other opinions before I try opening the
trans?
