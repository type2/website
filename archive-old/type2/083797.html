Subject: Re: [T2] What IS this stuff?

&gt;1) Not a clue....not bus related
&gt;2) Goes behind the window crank handle
&gt;3) A new injecter
&gt;4) An American car flasher
&gt;5) Radio knob
&gt;6) Wire end cover for the rear side marker lights
&gt;7) Inspection hole plugs for the rear brakes
&gt;8) ??? The 1st pic sorta looks like part of the connecter on the aux air valve
&gt;wire plug but the 2nd one kills that idea.
&gt;9) ???
&gt;10) petcock for a radiator!
&gt;11) 'choke' for your radio input wire, to cut down on ignition static, it
&gt;works best where you found it :)

9) Looks like the plastic air seal that goes behind the alternator tin.  If 
you've got one laying there, you may not have one in place.

10) Petcock alright, but could be for draining the water tank on a Westy.  
Looks just like the one under my 73.

73 Westy
