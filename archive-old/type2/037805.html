Subject: Re: Transmission rebuilding service offered

Since Doc Ric has so generously offered to rebuild trannys I will start
casting brand aluminum new upright cases in my carport. Just send me 1000
beer cans and 17.50 for shipping and Ill have them right out to you as
soon as I work out the kinks.
