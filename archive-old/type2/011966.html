Hi Volks,

On my 1980 Westy,  the HC and CO came down
dramatically when I added a catalytic converter.  I
don't think I would have passed without it.  Luckily,
Virginia doesn't check NOx on 1980 Westies.  I believe
NOx is almost totally controlled by the EGR.

It was totally amazing to me how little difference the
air box mixture screw makes on HC and CO.  Does anyone
know if this screw affects gas mileage much?  If so,
which position gives maximum gas mileage?

Rob
