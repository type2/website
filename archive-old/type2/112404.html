&gt;  Like David and Susan, we have few regulations felt by
&gt; most of the rest of America.  In my town a junker in
&gt; the yard only adds to the property value, a full tank
&gt; of gas is a plus!  It is not an uncommon sight to see
&gt; a car tooling down the road with no plate at all.

Actually, Tennessee is pretty much the same. As long as the car has the better
part of four wheels and stays out of the way of the cops on the way to get
donuts, you can drive it. Unfortunately, Tennessee is a stickler on titles. I
had to spend $139 with a company in Birmingham to get my '74 retitled.

But Tennessee is generally lawless. No income tax. No auto inspections. Of
course the schools are ranked 49th in the country...
