Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] Awkward Gears on a 1976 T2



I have a '79 tranny in my 70, and have the same problem.  I don't think it 
is the bushings, since I replaced mine recently and this didn't solve the 
problem.  1st and 2nd are a real pain, 3rd and 4th are smooth as silk.  I 
think it might be the selector forks in the nosecone, but I'm not sure.  
Anyone know much about troubleshooting the 091?

&gt;sounds like you need to
&gt;replace the shift linkage bushings
&gt;they're not too expensive
&gt;but the rear is a real bitch to get on/off
&gt;you should replace both front and rear wile you have the shifter 
&gt;disconnected
&gt;have fun!!!!!!!!
