Subject: Re: [T2] Samba Effect  /RANT/

&gt;Guy says he's seen similar busses for $8000 on
&gt;Samba, so its a bargain at around $3000.
&gt;
&gt;Geesh.  Makes me think I should snap up one of
&gt;those old Explorers, Monteros or Troopers (still
&gt;get 20 mpg just like a bus) and carry my tent.

There is a '78 baywindow Westy here in town that has been sitting for a 
couple of month without a sliding door on in all weather OUTSIDE (wet 
interior) with a trashed interior, etc. with a for sale sign in the window 
for $3K. I know this bus and it was used for a couple years as a work 
vehicle so the camper stuff has been trashed by carrying a wide variety of 
building supplies. The bus is there and can be fixed but will need a full 
resto.

$1K-$1.5K but tell that to the owner...

Yes - I know what you mean.

Went to a local junkyard east of here back in '95 to collect another set of 
tin from a Type IV. Owner started lecturing me how even the SCREWS are 
getting rare... Give me a break....
