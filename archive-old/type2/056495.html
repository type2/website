Subject: oil leak rant ('71)

Boy am I tired of dealing with the mysterious oil leak!  It is causing 
quite a dent in my overall mechanical confidence and in general is
responsible for pi**ing me off every time I drive the bus. The leak
appears to be about right under where the oil cooler is. The oil cooler
was tested a year ago when I first started battling this leak, and it was
said to be fine.  I've had the oil cooler seals replaced by a mechanic
once, and recently I did them myself as the leak was no better.  Still, it
leaks. The front main seal is relatively new and my clutch isn't slipping,
so I've eliminated that from the equation. maybe I shouldn't have....
 The oil puddle appears soon after I stop the engine.  3-5
tablespoons maybe.  Could the rear main still be bad?  
Should I suspect a cracked case?  Aargh!  I guess I'm about
ready just to deal with it and carry a couple of quarts of oil wherever I
go.  As easy as it is, I'm getting tired of spending my weekend free time
doing engine R &amp; R.  Thanks for listening.
