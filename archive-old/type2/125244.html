&gt; This list ROCKS!!

I have to agree!  It's incredible the amount of info one can get in short
time!  My drum WAS stuck this morning.  I scratched my head, came in and
made a post, and went out and whacked it with a hammer a few more times.  By
the time I came in, I already had a half dozen msgs waiting on me and got a
phone call of moral support.  Well, the drum gave way!  I think I'm going to
have to pop the axel nut anyhow, though.  Thanks everyone!

Have a good one,
Eric Shook
