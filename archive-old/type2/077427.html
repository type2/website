Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Busted accel. cable/pedal?

I'd stay right away from any hinge except a specific
one designed for an accelerator pedal.
Gate &amp; door hinges are designed to bear weight to a
certain degree but not for really frequent use like
that in a car.
The last camper we owned, Daisy, had the pedal hinge
replaced before we owned her with a large door hinge.
I'm sure it was good enough for a while but about 6
months after we bought her, the hinge started to play
up, moving to one side instead of straight down as it
wore away.
It ruined part of the linkage and eventually would not
put enough pressure down to move Daisy faster than
20km/h(about 10mph).
Not only had the hinge been fitted wrongly but it had
also been welded to the pedal and took a lot of
fixing.
Take my advice...replace it with the real deal or
source another one at a wrecking yard.
I fully believe that the way the door hinge had been
fitted to my camper also hastened the rust in the
floor which had to be repaired soon after.

&gt; Joshua,
&gt; 
&gt; Well don't know if you've been able to confirm if
&gt; the pedal was the problem 
&gt; or not but I thought I'd pass on the solution I came
&gt; up with when I first 
&gt; got &quot;Janis&quot; 18yrs ago.  The pedal actually became
&gt; unmounted to the body 
&gt; because of rust, I still have swiss cheese floor. 
&gt; But what I did was bolted 
&gt; the pedal to a huge gate hinge! Haven't had a
&gt; problem with it since;&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck, perhaps a little greased lightning?
