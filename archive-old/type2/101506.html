Subject: BBB AZ Propane Q

AZ Folks -

I have some 5-gallon propane tanks, one of which I was going to bring to BBB 
for heat. These are &quot;older&quot; propane tanks without the new, California 
(only?) &quot;overfill prevention valves&quot;.

Does AZ have the same law that a propane tank must have the OPV for a 
propane dealer to fill the tank?

Mike &amp; Itch (look for Itch in &quot;both&quot; VW mags next month!)
