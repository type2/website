Subject: Re: [T2] more cv questions

&gt; &gt; This is not a good sign.  New CVJs tend to be &quot;stiff&quot;, but have the full
&gt;
&gt; That's what I thought I would hear.


They will go back together 2 ways.
1 way is right,
the other is wrong.

the wrong way will end up with a CV that locks and doesn't
flex.  I think you would eat the CV joint before you got to the
end of your driveway.

When you assemble them, they should want to fall apart,
not seize and stay together.  It should be a pain to keep
the CVs on the ends of the axle, they want to rotate and
drop bearings on the ground.

if you put them together wrong, they require a hammer
to get apart.  Knock the hammer on one side until it
rotates enough that the bearings start to fall out.

put it back together the right way.
