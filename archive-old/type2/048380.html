&gt; &gt;I have a 1969 bus, 1600cc engine, with a bad oil leak behind
&gt; the crankshaft pulley.  As you can imagine the location of
&gt; this leak causes a spray of oil everytime I drive my car.  I
&gt; have tried several things that have been suggested to me
&gt; such as: swapping the crankshaft pulleys (haven't tried a
&gt; brand new one though), doing a new ring job, replacing the
&gt; oil pump gaskets, and I've even tried stopleak.  Anything
&gt; I'm missing?  Help me out before I burn my engine up!
Well,

Leaks from behind the crankshaft pulley at the rear of the engine are
caused by 3 things generally (rear is rear of car, if you mean front of
the car then different stuff applies))

1) bad blowby. If your rings leak then you will overpressurize the
crankcase and blow oil out behind that pulley.

2) no crankcase venting: your breather has the vent plugged off or you
have an aftermarket breather with no vent.  Even a brand new engine has
some crankcase pressure, if you dont have the vent on the oil filler the
only place for this air to escape is around the crank pulley, and with oil
being much more plentiful there it will get blown out along with the
air. When one has a proper vent, this area around the pulley genearally
acts as an intake (dont ask me how this works, it just does, hehe)

3) your dipstick is wrong and yourvan gets too much oil: if you have
too much oil itll blow out there too, check to make sure your dipstick is
right. (a stock engine takes about 2.5 quarts...)

thats all i can think of, and im not a professional so take that advice
with a grain of salt ;)

take care,

Steve
