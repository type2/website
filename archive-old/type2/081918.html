Subject: Re: [T2] CV joint troubles

That's why the comment about posi-traction was made with a smirk.  I don't
know what part of the country your from but, up north we know about what
happens when one of the driving wheels loses traction (up in the air).
That's what posi-traction/limited slip diffs address.  Enough on the
mechanical side.  If your concerned about a tragedy, I'd say don't try it.
Course it's up to you.  Maybe you'd feel more comfortable standing next to
the bus and just listening near the wheel with the partner inside.  Allows
you to test which side is the offending side at least.

Good luck and be careful,
Bill

&gt;
&gt; Dave Bolan and other esteemed listees:
&gt;
&gt; My noise would indeed be a clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk - in time to the
spinning tire...
&gt;
&gt; I replaced the really chewed up drivers side outer joint because it would
make a repeated clunk when I
&gt; turned left hard.  This new replacement joint just clunks all the freakin'
time, even when I'm going
&gt; straight ahead.  Needless to say, I'm not driving the bus except to test
it out...
&gt;
&gt; Can I clarify what you're telling me in your email below?  Jack up just
one tire, block all other wheels,
&gt; start car without emergency brake engaged, put bus in first gear, then let
out clutch??  Won't this send
&gt; me flying off the jack stands, blocks or no blocks?  Would it make more
sense to jack up BOTH wheels?
&gt;
&gt; And you're saying have a buddy in the bus to hit the brakes when/if
needed, but I stay outside and peer
&gt; into the cv joint vicinity to see exactly where the clunk is coming from?
Sounds a little hairy.
&gt;
&gt; I don't want to die for a clunk, y'know?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Paul

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Describe &quot;clunk&quot;...not? clunk, clunk, clunk...but just clunk?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Jack driver side rear up after putting large wheel chocks on every other
&gt; &gt; wheel....put car in 1'st at idle....assuming you haven't installed
&gt; &gt; posi-trak&lt;grin&gt;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Have a helper in the car when you do this and be ready to apply brakes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Listen for clunk.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; &gt; So my drivers side outer joint was really chewed to bits.  I went out
and bought two more (one for
&gt; &gt; &gt; road backup, as the list advises...), replaced the offending joint,
and man, if that clunk didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; get LOUDER.  Now I've removed and reinstalled the joint twice to no
avail.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This weekend I'm gonna do some serious thinking about it.  What could
be loose?  Dirty?  Could a bad
&gt; &gt; &gt; CV joint mess up some other nearby component like brakes or wheel
bearings?
