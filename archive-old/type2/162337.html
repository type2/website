&gt; I saw one in person last year. Since the rubber isn't made anymore, and 30
&gt; year old tire rubber is worse than useless, it's just for novelty now.
&gt;
&gt; But it was VW's first attempt at a &quot;space saver&quot; spare. Before the little
&gt; donuts with &quot;SPARE&quot; for the tread came out.

which even VW gave up on, they now advertise that they have a full size
spare in those things they sell now with the engine at the wrong end.
