&gt;My recently rebuilt 77 2.0 liter FI engine hesitates slightly when I
&gt;accelerate, then surges strongly. What is going on here? 

I would verify timing and mixture before anything else. You will need a
exhaust gas measuring instrument for the mixture, but the timing can be set
with a timing light. If that's stock, then start looking for a vacuum leak.
