&quot;The price, condition and camping arrangement of the vehicle were enough

Shame on you! The 1972 model year was VW's finest hour, so to speak :)&gt;

All holy wars aside, follow this link to a pic of Mike &quot;Buddah&quot; Meyers 1972
Adventure camper. I think he has you beat on the price though. I recall that
he said he paid $1 for the bus.

Here is another link to a really great VW bus camping event in the North
Carolina mountains that Mike hosts. http://members.aol_dot_com/docric/highc.html
