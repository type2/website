Subject: Help with cargo doors and front door weaterstripping, PLease

I've got three different styles for the front doors.  a 4.5 ft piece with a
channel in it, about 1.2 ft piece with a channel in it.  I about 2.5 ft piece
that kind of looks like 1.4 wood trim (the shape looking at the end), and then
I have about a 4 ft piece of square.  Then there's the cargo doors, p pieces
and I don't have a glue.  Any one have pictures of both sets of door with this
type installed (WW rubber)

Not to mention my door shut like s*** with anything in there.
