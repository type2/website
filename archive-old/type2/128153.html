Subject: Re: [T2] Jay Leno fights California smog revision

Not sure if California will be more stringent than
North Carolina emissions (guessing it will be) but
BOTH my 1977 and my 1976 passed Mecklenburg County
smog emission tests the last 2 years.  My '77 had a
charcoal filter but it wasn't hooked up at the time it
passed.
