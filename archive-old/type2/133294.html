I am sure many would appreciate them, and I am always open to being
convinced I'm wrong.  wouldn't be the first time

&gt; I value the time I can spend doing valve adjustments, they are valve

I have other things I would rather be doing, like spending time with my
family.

&gt; inspections and help to see OTHER issues that will kill your engine if gone
&gt; untouched...

what can you see (average person not skill machinist) looking at your
valves while adjusting that I cannot see with the hdy.  I do remove the
covers at least once a year and check for things loose etc.

&gt; I have solid lifters in my bus, I went 15,000 miles AFTER my dyno session on
&gt; the engine before I finally had a valve that needed adjustment..(I checked

I don't have a dyno, I have gone about 70,000 miles on this engine rebuild
and have not had to adjust the valves at all (except the one that broke)

&gt; them every 1,000 miles to see the effects of my cryogenic enhancement

cryogenic enhancement?????   don't got that.

&gt; processes) The key is keeping the engine at the correct temperature and
&gt; controlling expansion and contraction. The more stable the engine is, the

no argument, and I have full set of guages and try to keep engine temp
consisitent and low...

&gt; less the valve train will shift and cause issues..  No doubt the cryogenic
&gt; treatment of the parts kept the stability of the parts in check, as I have
&gt; never seen another engine go that long in a bus with that stability in the
&gt; valvetrain..

but how many of us mere mortals have cryogenic treatment of parts (hmmm
what would doc tim say about non DM methods)  my hyd valve train has been
that stable.

&gt; BTW, the same Devilish figure that introduced the hydraulic lifters,
&gt; probably played a key role in the camshaft choice for the stock engine...

what's wrong with the camshaft choice,. these are workhorse vehicles not
show cars, at least that is how they were designed anyway

I put a new cam in mine when rebuilt and it was stock
