Subject: Another lurker comes clean

OK I admit it, I'm one of those snivelling lurkers as well.  I've been on the
list for a few weeks now, trying to glean as much info as possible about type
2s because I want to buy one (late bay window pop-top camper please).  I drive
an '84 Passat GL5 at the moment (OK its not aircooled but still VW).  I'd be
glad to hear from fellow list members in the UK.

Keep feeding me the useful info.
