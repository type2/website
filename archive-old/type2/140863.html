Subject: Re: [T2] Side view mirrors

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; speaking of side view mirrors, for the 12 years I've owned my 74
&gt; Westy, I have always had the mirrors oriented long side vertically.
&gt; The other day, i noticed a Westy with the mirrors oriented long side
&gt; horizontally.  What was the factory orientation?

Some time in the mid 70's,,, I was going to say 1978,, Volkswagen had an ad that
stated something like... this years model is 2&quot; wider !

All they did was change the long side vertical,, to the long side horizontal....

If I find the ad,, I'll pass it on
