Subject: Re: [T2] the mechanic's full notes on Alice

&gt; Apparently this guy knows little about VWs...for instance, the cap won't
&gt; go on 180 off.  Sure it could be /wired/ 180 off...but that sure isn't
&gt; what he said.

As I said, the cap was not on incorrectly, of that I am sure. But I give
people the benefit of the doubt when I am hearing them second-hand, through
another body, as I did in this case. I also cut folks some slack on their
communication skills; not everyone's are the best. I have an ex-husband who
is living proof of this fact -- brilliant, but entirely inept with effective
communication. Never quite said what he meant to, even when you would have
thought it would have been simple to have done so.

&gt; Has he /ever/ worked on an aircooled VW before?  Poor guy, being shoved
&gt; into this.

Yep. And the owner of the shop worked on them for years and years and
years -- used to be exclusive to German motors -- though, he admits, it's
been a while since he last had his hands in one of this type.

&gt; Both of which can certianly be measured by a competent mechanic.

Yes, but this wasn't an issue of competency. It was a question of time and
money. He was working within my time and budgetary constraints for the time
being.

&gt; Now, I'm just stepping into this...but /do not/ take this thing back to
&gt; these guys.

I doubt it will be brought back to them, but not for all the reasons you
suggest.

&gt; I understand that you're starting a new job soon.  Monday?  Have you got a
&gt; Muir manual?  For all of the errors, it's a damn good start.

Burning Man on Monday (time constraint), job starts on the 8th (after six
months plus of being unemployed, that's the budgetary part of the equation).

&gt; Anyway. Sit down, use this weekend to read through the book and go
&gt; step-by-step through the proceedures.  Ask the list for specifics when you
&gt; need'm.

Thanks. Further work on her will have to wait until after Burning Man,
however. My time is now being poured into how to get all our gear into my
Honda, and our entire camping style is being rethought. She's on the back
burner for the next couple weeks, unfortunately.
