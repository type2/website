Subject: Taillight and blinker problem
Message-ID: &lt;23c211da.2470a48d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I got a problem here that's just baffling me.  I had to replace my taillights 
on my 1971 Transporter and I wired the new housings just like the old 
ones...now my lights are doing some wierd things.  When i turn on the lights, 
they both go on...it's all good.  When i turn on either blinker with the 
lights on...neither rear blinker works.  When i turn on the left blinker with 
the lights off, it blinks rapidly.  When i turn on the right blinker with the 
lights off, it does nothing.  When i push the brakes with the lights on, it 
does nothing (in terms of lighting)  When i push the brakes with the lights 
off, only the left side lights up in the rear.  All other lights work 
appropriately.  I have no clue what this could be...all the wiring seems to 
be in order, and the blinkers and brake lights worked properly prior to the 
replacement.  PLEASE HELP!!
