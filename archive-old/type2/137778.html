Subject: Re: [T2] '71 &quot;Clunk&quot; in steering

Well, I'm not an expert either, but experience I have had has seen a
tearing rubber flex joint where the steering column attaches to the
steering knuckle at the floor.

I've also seen failed bushings that hold the steering column shaft
away from the steering column shell.

busboys.cc and wolfgangint_dot_com are in Redding CA. They both deal with
steering boxes, though availability can be spotty. Both have
workshops. Busboys works on that kind of stuff, though I don't know
the exactly what they can do with steering gear boxes. I don't know if
Wolfgang works on them or not.
