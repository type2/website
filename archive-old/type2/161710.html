Subject: RE: [T2] This guy should be horse whipped......

It's not my van, and I would not mis-represent what I had done to it as a 
resto- however, in all fairness I am just finishing a van which I will be 
selling for 3600.00


Van, no title-                             100.00
Engine                                      350.00
CV axles (missing, no core)           245.00
Muffler                                        80.00
Sheet metal                               200.00
Tractor paint &amp; reducer               110.00
New window seals                      150.00
New brake hoses                         48.00
Every other thing,
dist cap, wires, plugs,
points, condensor,
fuel filter, pump,
electrical connectors, wire,
headlights, turnsignal lenses,
and everything needed to
repair the horrorstory of a
electrical hack job
by the previous owner,
body filler, sandpaper, primer,
fuel line,  spares from the herd
including hub caps, unbent rims
mirrors, ect, ect, ect.                 lets just pretend they're free since 
I'm too lazy to look them up
                                              or itemize them

Total excluding labor,towing
or shipping (on parts)               1283.00

It's not a cheap thing to re-animate a junkyard vehicle, and concours restos 
are wonderfull, but how many list members can afford them?
