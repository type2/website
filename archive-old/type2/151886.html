Subject: Re: [T2] Powder

Mark,

Looks good!  Don't forget to run taps thru the threads before you get 
ready to install....all of them!

Pooey...pot metal indeed....

Here are some of the comparison pics on mine.  Flash is a little bright,
but the color shows well.  Especially in the last pic.

or this slightly out of focus one  
http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-013.html

You can compare the color of the dist cap and coil though.

Can't wait to see the complete engine!

Cheers, dave

 Fast forward to last week. I took my shroud halves over to the powder 
 coater to get them media blasted. As I talked to the guy at the desk, I 
 noticed a stock powder color that looked identical to the shroud in 
 that picture. We talked about it, he gave all the usual cautions about 
 pot metal, and I decided to give it a try.
&gt; 
&gt; It wasn't cheap -- $150 -- but I got it back today. The picture linked 
&gt; below doesn't really do the color justice. It's exactly the same color 
&gt; as the ad.

&gt; It will show up better when I install it and powdercoated tin on the 
&gt; engine in a couple of months. This was much easier than the tinted 
&gt; clear coat, and I got what I wanted.
