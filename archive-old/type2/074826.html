Subject: Re: [T2] Pop top hold downs

I have all 3 rubber hold downs with the metal and the brackets that screw to
the bus. I don't know exactly which it is you need, but you can have the
part you need for free (in honor once again of Karl von Salzen giving away
parts to me for free). Just pmail me your address and explain which part
exactly you need.

Subject: [T2] Pop top hold downs


&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; I'm looking for the metal brackets that attach to the original style
rubber
&gt; roof hold downs. I have 'new' rubber hold downs (without the brackets) and
&gt; want to fabricate 'original' style by installing the metal to the new
&gt; rubber. I have 2, need one more. I've depleted my supply at the local
&gt; salvage yard...
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I have a 73 Campmobile.
&gt;
