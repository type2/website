sorry, I didn't give very complete info. bumper is for a 68-72 bus. its =
not something I really want to box and ship, and in the shape its in you =
probably wouldn't be doing your self any favors buy paying for boxing =
and shipping of such a large item.  again its loacted in springfield =
oregon and is tweaked at one end from me backing into a hydrant. could =
be bent back to make a decent bumper for a driver, Better than the 2x6's =
I see on all the buses around town.
