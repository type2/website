Subject: blown fuse in starter relay circuit

Yesterday, I installed the Berg version of a starter relay on my '71 Westy.
This version has a  15A fuse in the solenoid circuit.

Today, the third time I started the engine, the fuse blew.

I'm afraid I don't have any feel for the current which a normal solenoid
draws.  If it is anywhere near 15A, however, it is no wonder that the IR
drop along the two wires which carry voltage to the ignition switch and
back to the solenoid is excessive.

Before I resort to &quot;sticking a penney in the fuse box&quot;,  does anyone know
how many amps a solenoid should draw?  If it is considerably less than 15,
is this evidence that my solenoid is defective?  Are solenoids available
for purchase separately from the starter motor?

Jack
