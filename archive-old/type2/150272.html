&quot;Without disappointment you can't appreciate victory.&quot;



Name the movie the quote came from and feel good about yourself. Here is
the story.

Recap: Engine just completely rebuilt. Installed in van. Had a hard time
starting it yesterday. Went to finish today and this...





I checked the grounds, cleaned up the tranny ground strap, everything
grounded, no shorts. I then try to crank it over, a little better but
not enough to get it firing. Stumped I decide to jumpstart it. I roll
the car outside in neutral and use a diesel truck to try to jump-start
it but still nothing. Not wanting to be out in the cold 15 degrees or
so, I have my helper role the car back inside the shop. I pop off the
distributor cap to check that I can get an arc between the points when I
open them and see the points are open. No biggie, I put the wrench on
the generator just as I did yesterday and earlier today but this time I
cannot get it to budge. I assume the starter has hung up so I put it
into third and heave ho the van back and forth. Not much happened. I go
and try to move it again, nothing. I crawl under the bus and undo the
starter but it did not seem to be hanging up on anything. I take off the
valve covers and check that nothing is awry, nothing is but I loosen up
the rocker arms anyway. Still cannot get it to turn. The only two things
I can think of are that either something is in a cylinder and binding it
or the oil pump has bound up somehow. It was all working yesterday and I
have oil pressure. I am a bit stumped as to what to do next. I plan on
taking the spark plugs out and trying to look down the holes to see if
anything is in there. I am truly miffed. I am guessing I will have to
pull the engine, tear it down, and try to find something wrong. I would
guess a bearing would seize but it does not make sense considering it
never got hot, the engine has yet to run. Any thoughts, whims, or ideas?



Thanks,



Max Bronsema
