Salutations:

I'm in the middle of replacing all flexible fuel lines on my fuel injected
bus ('79).  OK so what about the rubber line connecting the injectors to
the fuel rail?  It looks as if one end is crimped directly onto the
injector?  How can this be replaced?  Do I have to buy new injectors to
replace these lines?
