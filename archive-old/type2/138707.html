Subject: RE: [T2] Air question

&gt;From: Clayton Polizzi

&gt;Well my bus is still leaking fuel out of the left carb.  I'm  trying to 
&gt;seal up all the loose or bad fittings to eliminate leaks.  I have an elbow 
&gt;(022129637) which bus depot list as a Aux Air Regulator elbow.  First, what 
&gt;is an Aux Air regulator?  I comes off my intake manifolds and then goes to 
&gt;the front somewhere.  Second, Do I need it?  Of course that depends on the 
&gt;first answer.  Third,  How accurate are the bus depot listings.  With this 
&gt;part number it shows that it goes in a 74-79. My bus is a 73.  There is no 
&gt;picture so I'm not a 100% sure.

&gt;1973 bus with no name


You don't need the Aux. Air Regulator IIRC. Well that is, that part goes 
with the FI system not the carbs.

Good Luck and name that bus(it may mysteriously solve some problems),
