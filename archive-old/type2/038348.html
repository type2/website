Subject: Re: Jack points?

Hi Raoul!

The stock jack is good for a pinch, tho I really don't trust it unless (a) I 
have a piece of wood under it, and (2) I have blocked both sides of at least 
2 wheels!  

The Ex went to the local NAPA parts store and bought this 2 ton Lincoln 
hydraulic jack... It's not one of these cheapy Chinese ones, this will lift 
the back end of Lily, fully loaded, off the ground like a foot and roll her 
around.   Best $100 he ever spent!  Plus... the handle is removable (by a 
thumbscrew - this thing is built really industrial), and the whole thing 
stores under the back seat!

As to jack points... I use the cast ends of the torsion tubes... I figure 
they are cast steel so they should hold up, and not crush (like the 
jackpoints)... have never had a problem with this!

Hugs,
