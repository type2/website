Subject: Re: [T2] Brake affecting idle? Also my idle problems..

One more point.  I have had carbs do this to me in a seemingly incureable 
manner, that I could not get to work properly without swapping out jets from 
a donor carb.  I have a few I keep just for parts, for both the 30/31 and 
the 34.  It is one of those items I look for specifically while junkyarding.

Thanks.. Good points about the fuel/air leakage (being interchangeable).
It's just such a brain tease, because it's basically a new carb, still shiny
from the box, and it's been used relatively little. The bus sits in the
drive most of the time.. But then, maybe that has something to do with it?
Hmmm. Jan B
