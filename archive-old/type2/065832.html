Subject: custom '72 to '75 heat exchanger conversion

Hey, y'all.

I have a 1975 Westy, with an actual 1975 engine modified from 1800cc to
2000cc. In order to save money (go ahead and laugh, it's true), I decided
to go with the 1972 exhaust system instead of the '75 -- fewer parts,
greater availability, greater number of muffler/extractor choices. The '72
heat exchangers went on the engine fine. Of course, the one small drawback
is that the '72 heat exchangers end as stubby holes in the front;  they
don't reach all the way up to the '75 heater pipes on the body of the
car.

So I got a set of front heater flaps, and I'm going to figure out where
they should sit in relation to the intake pipes and weld them onto the
heat exchangers (thus essentially creating my own 1975 heating/exhaust
system).  Has anybody done this before? Any advice? Please save me from
myself -- if you have any wisdom to impart, I'm going to do the job next
weekend.
