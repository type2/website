Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Air Dist - Fat Hose Rpl Help

Bob,

Easier to unbolt the air runners from the heads if you're going to replace those hoses.

I always get nervous about that wooshing sound too, but the engine is taking air in at idle so...

Billy 

For a 2.0L FI engine, is there an easy way to replace those four short fat intake air dist to manifold tube hoses without first removing the intake air dist?

I can also hear air being sucked in during idle, but maybe that sound is normal for a FI engine?
