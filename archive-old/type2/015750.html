&gt;Can a rod make a constant noise?  

Not usually.  General rule:  A bad rod or main bearing will knock softly at
idle, loud under acceleration or deceleration, and be almost inaudible when
you transition between acceleration and deceleration.  

&gt;What else can make a constant noise under
&gt;all loads and gets quieter at higher RPMs?  Could I be dropping a valve seat.

Don't know about the dropped valve seat, I've never had that happen,
although it seems to be a common problem - guess I've just been lucky.
Valvetrain problems usually manifest themselves as a constant noise with
respect to acceleration, and yes, I think they could get quieter at high
rpms, maybe in part because the engine is just noisier at higher rpms.
