Subject: Re: What's in a name

the names that have been chosen for my fleet have flowed from the karma i 
have felt from the vehicle either while doing surgery or hopefully driving. 
recently we purchased a red 71 ghia conv. on the way home the left front 
brake disc caught fire(i blew it out-huff huff). since it was my 13th vw, 
red, caught fire, and after looking at vw history book, i named him firery 
fritz after fritz niehmeyer(sp)and project 13. added inspiration was the 
adult beverage and kids running around that i couldnt call him what i felt 
at the moment of the fire.true story, names are real to protect the guilty.

&gt;i have often wondered where the names come from!? especially since mine
&gt;was a secret for the first few weeks. i have the kreeper by the way. it
&gt;is my three year old son's favorite scooby doo episode and then i
&gt;thought what the heck its slow too and then a friend added (who has
&gt;rescued me twice before my rebuild) that i would be spending a lot of
&gt;time on a creeper!! ha ha very funny! anyway thats where mine came from.
&gt;its my  ca license plate too so you all can spot me rather easily!!
&gt;brian and the kreeper
