Subject: New URL up and running for New German Side Tents

I know most of you know already that I sell new German Side Tents, Carver
Propane furnaces, and lots of other little goodies for Bus, Vanagon, and
Eurovan.

But there are quite a few new folks on the list that may be interested, and I
do have a new web site up and running, so here goes:

http://EuroCampers_dot_com

New German Side Tents for all VW vans.

Awnings
Bike racks
Propane furnaces
Wind deflectors
Side door/rear hatch screen kits
Projektzwo Accessories
Vanagon cup holders
Vanagon gray water tanks
Nokian Hakkapelitta tires (best winter tires in the world, and all season
reinforced tires too)
Retractable seatbelt conversion kits for Baywindow Bus

Not everything is up on my web pages yet, so p-mail me for items you don't
find there.

I spend a great deal of time in product development, and try out everything
myself, (or at least find a few Guinea pigs) before I offer it to the world
wide web.  I've ordered stuff many times that just doesn't work out, and I've
eaten the costs.  I try to be painfully honest regarding all the items I
carry, and I often try to talk customers out of buying tents when there e-
mails read like this: &quot;My only requirement for a tent is that is lightweight
and very easy to setup.&quot;

You will find some new tents up on my site within the next week, and I'll
repost when I have the info up.  They aren't the lightest, or easiest thing to
setup, but there are some new improvements this year that help just a little.

Thanks
