Subject: Seattle to Lake Havasu for December...

Howdy Volks,

I am moving out of my house in Seattle this weekend...  I have more VW stuff
accumulated than I know what to do with :)

Tristan and I are driving down to Lake Havasu likely Sunday evening or
Monday morning... plan to be there as soon as we can (Tuesday) to help
Ronnie with the fire clean-up.

Current plans are to spend most of the month, including Christmas, in Lake
Havasu.  Tristan is flying home next weekend (she is only spending 1
week)... and we have booked flights both ways for New Years .. as we don't
know what is going to make sense at that time :)

Anyway, no one has asked me to deliver anything .... last chance.  Cargo
space is real tight this trip, but let me know and we can see if something
can be worked out.

Thanks to all.

   Stephen Gutknecht
