Subject: Re: [T2] big-o 1/2 inch breaker bar

&lt;&lt; I bought this to remove gland nut and of course I bent it (and

returned it - 'broke it' lifetime warranty). Can anyone on the list

recommend a 1/2 drive breaker bar or slider bar that happily takes

300+ ftlbs of torque. Sears is not an option, impact wrench is not

preffered.  Looks like everyone wants to sell those weak &quot;flex bars&quot;.
