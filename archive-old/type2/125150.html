Subject: Can't Turn the bus off

Well I can't turn off the bus with the key anymore - everything was working
great then I heard a funny noised after I shut off the bus - turned it back on
and now I can't shut her down with a key any longer - starts up fine but have
to pull the main wire off the coil and then the battery cause everything is
still getting power - switch bad now or ??????
