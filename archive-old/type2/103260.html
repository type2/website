Subject: Re: [T2] Miniature Woodstove

in washington in the late 70's and 80s i remember people having little pot belly 
stoves hooked up in their buses with chimneys out the top. not space conserving and 
required air but folks didn't take it all so seriously then. just wanted warm and 
dry.  we were all younger then too :-))
