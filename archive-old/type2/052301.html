I have a real question directly involving this part.  What does it do?  
I mean, it's part of the flapper valve, right?  So, what's a flapper valve?
My old 78 had two of these deals hooked to the motor mount, and I just 
thought they were silly.  They were never hooked to anything, but I assume
that's because they were hooked with cheap foil hose or something.  
I just want to know because one day someone's going to come to me with a 
question about those funny exhaust pipes on their bus, and I won't know
what to tell them.

thanks,
