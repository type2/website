Subject: We're stuck in the stone age

I was just staring absentmindedly at my Timex watch ($19.95) and thinking 
about how much data I get on the tiny (1/4&quot; X 5/8&quot;) LCD tucked under the 
analog display. All I have to do is push a button to get different 
displays of elapsed time, and who knows what else.

I further reflect that I have two (comparatively huge) LCDs in Peregrine 
-- one in my radio, and another in my CB. Now wouldn't it be nice if I 
could wire in data from my oil temp sender, a CHT, an oil pressure 
sender, and a vacuum sender, and just push a button to select a display? 
Or have the numbers all on the screen at once. And store a maximum for 
each (minimum for oil pressure)? Or push a button and display nothing at all.

If anyone on the list knows anyone in the consumer electronics business,
tell them that there's probably a substantial market for aftermarket
radios that also display gauge data, and that I will be more than happy to
test the prototype.
