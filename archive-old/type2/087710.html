Subject: Problem with idle (Please help)

Hi,

I have a problem with my engine idle &quot;hunting&quot;.

It revs to &quot;normal&quot;, stalls a bit and comes back again.

The rearmost right hand cylinder had it's spark plug wire cap cracked
open. It has the last &quot;bump&quot; where it goes on to the plug cracked off
and open. Manufacturer, bugpack. Put them in at -40C.

I also found the choke wire to be broken right off. Further
investigation found a rock in the pulley, obviously this stressed it to
it's breaking point.

I removed the pulley for the moment to get length for the choke and have
hooked it up again. It is still &quot;hunting&quot;.

Replaced all plugs and am proceeding with tune up.

Please help if you can.

Alan
