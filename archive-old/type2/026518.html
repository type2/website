Subject: RE:  engine stalled, won't start again

&gt;the engine stalled and wouldn't start again. Checked ignition dwell and 
&gt;that was fine, CDI is whistling normally, but from the sound of the engine 
&gt;turning over (easily and evenly), I guess there's no fuel going to the
carbs. 
&gt;Indeed the spark plugs were dry. However, the fuel pump is humming and 
&gt;there are no kinks in the fuel hoses.  Any ideas, anyone?
&gt;
&gt;PS: It's a dual carb setup on a 911 engine, although I don't think that
&gt;should matter.

Check the basics.  I assume the 911 distributors have points?  If so, check
them for proper operation and gap.  Make sure there is 12 volts at the
positive side of the coil.  Make sure your timing didn't drift so far off
(failure to tighten dist clamp) that it won't go.  Check for spark by
pulling a plug wire and holding it close to the case while a friend cranks
the engine a few times (exercise normal cautions here).  Also turn on the
key, pump the gas pedal a few times and make sure there is gas going into
the carbs.

I mean, think about it in really simple terms:  If there's gas then all you
need is a spark at the right time.  If there's a spark at the right time
then all you need is gas.

Let us know what you find!!!
