Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Gasket Set Replacement

Tina 
I think its easier to reseal a 2.0ltr then a beetle engine, you do not have  
to remove the heads. 
grab a Bentley manual with the money your going to save doing the work  
yourself, it will become very helpful the more you work on your bus.
 
I would recommend  getting a good quality seal set and make sure you  also 
get the front and rear main seal. (does not always comes with kits).
