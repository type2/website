Subject: Re: [T2] what would grove the push rod

I have seen this before.  It is caused by that thin, bent-up piece of 
wire (not sure what the exact name for it is) that holds the pushrod 
tubes in being damaged or installed improperly.  It then drags on the 
pushrod as it moves in and out (and rotates), causing the groove.

&gt; I just took the #1 exhaust push rod from an engine, I was told was recently  
&gt; rebuilt and found it has a grove about 10 mm wide and 2 mm deep about 2.5 cm
