Subject: Re: Shredded Hoses

&lt;Fabricate some sort of metal tube that is down near
the exhaust and comes up through the tin, then hook my hose to that?
Someone
mentioned that this is how the stock setup works.&lt;

No need to fabricate. Go to Bus Boys website or Busted Bus or Bus depot and
search. You can buy these tubes.
