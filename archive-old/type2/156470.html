Subject: Re: [T2] Water Injection

Man, you guys have got way too much time on your hands.  Cheers....KR
 It'd sure be interesting to fit a water injection on a bus 
engine, crank up the compression and let 'er rip. 

Shad H.

&gt;VWBrain described a water injection system made
&gt;popular in Mother Earth News
&gt;http://journeytoforever_dot_org/biofuel_library/ethanol_motherearth/me3.html
&gt;I had planned for several years to add water injection
&gt;to my T4 2L by using the EGR port into the plenum
&gt;chamber. I got as far as gutting out all the internal
&gt;plumbing inside the plenum that is attached to the EGR
&gt;port. I was not interested in H2O inj at high vacuum
&gt;as the system described in the link above does. I
&gt;wanted the water to inject at high engine load only,
&gt;as my intention was to lower the peak temperatures in
&gt;freeway driving.
