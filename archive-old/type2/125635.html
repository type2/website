Subject: New Engine,

So I am thinking of acquiring a new engine for my 73' Carb'ed Bus, 
pulling the 1700 and rebuilding it at my leisure, as my bus IS my daily 
driver and I am working WAY too much to be able to rebuild my 1700 and 
have no vehicle. The ulterior motive of course being having a &quot;spare&quot; 
1700 for the the next bus to come along, should it need it.

Having never bought a new complete longblock I am interested in some of 
your experiences with the various vendors as well as perhaps some 
prices, should you recall them, so that I can make some decisions.

I am of course looking at some of Jake's (Raby) offerings, as I have 
heard great things about them for some time now, however I want to see 
what people have to say about their complete longblock experiences.

Thoughts ? Recommendations ?
