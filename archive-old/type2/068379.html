1.  The grinding is symptomatic of a worn synchro ring.  Replacement rings
are inexpensive but the work is more than most want to tackle.  Be sure
you're using the proper lubricant for your year/model (and enough of it!).
 The phosphor-bronze synchro rings used in early trannys was not compatible
with multi-grade tranny lubes introduced in the late 1960's.  There are a
couple of VW Service Bulletins covering the matter.  Syncros rings used on
later model trannys (I believe from 1972 on) are of a different alloy and
work fine with both straight-weight and formulated lubricants.

2.  If you have a '75 you will have disk brakes on the front.  When the pads
become worn below a certain limit a spring-steel indicator will touch the
disk and give off a sound that will surely get your attention.  If your pads
are not fitted with these warning whiskers you may determine the remaining
life of the pads by direct measurement.  The health of the rotors themselves
is  also determined by direct measurement.  See the specs in your manual.

It's easy to know when to adjust your rear shoes.  Just count the clicks as
you set you parking/emergency brake.  Spec  typically calls for 4-5 clicks,
adjust when it reaches 7-8.  As for when to replace the shoes, here again it
is best done by direct measurement, in this case measuring the thickness of
the remaining brake lining.  Anything below an eighth of an inch -- 3.5mm or
thereabouts -- is cause for alarm.

During replacement of the rear brake shoes, simply measure the ID of the
brake drum.  The pass/fail spec for this dimension is in your manual.

3.  In all modern vehicle, including some Volkswagens :-) there is a circuit
- -- and a fuse -- set aside for a radio installation.  See the wiring diagram
in your manual.  (I wonder why I keep saying that :-)
