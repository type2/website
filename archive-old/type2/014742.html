I know that these were standard in 78 or 79. You will have to look in the
salvage yards to find them, or see if anyone is parting one on the list.
There may be a source for aftermarket slider, but I do not know who it is.

Hello All, I'm planning on putting slider windows in 74 bus.  Does anyone 
know of a source to obtain these?  I'm been looking through all my catalogs 
and I'm coming up empty.  Thanks, Marcus
