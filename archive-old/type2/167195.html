Subject: RE: [T2] Body Work $$$

&gt; A reputable shop wants wants $1900.00...does&gt; this sound reasonable (I'm in
SOCAL, so make allowance&gt; for EVERYTHING being more expensive). If they end up
doing GREAT work it would be worth it I suppose. But can you not just do the
minimum to get a driving bus?  As far as the door seals I would think you
could cut them to make them fit properly. I'm curious which vendor you got
them from? I got the cheapo seals for mine have have yet to install them.  PS
- you have any pics of the Pumkin progress? -Daniel
