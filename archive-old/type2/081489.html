Subject: Flooding a 2L 77 engine.

	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have '77 T2 with the 2L fuel injected engine.  I have been having a =
flooding problem for over a year now (so bad I cant drive the Bus).  The =
tight vacuum system, a recently new/rebuilt mass air flow sensor.  I =
have checked the cold start valve, temperature sensor in the head of the =
engine, air regulator, deceleration valve, and fuel injectors (none are =
leaking.)  I would appreciate any help.

thank you=20

Andy
