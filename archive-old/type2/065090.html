Subject: Subaru to Type II retrofit

Because of the many responses I received after mentioning my Subaru to Type
II  conversion, I have decided to post some step by step instructions for
doing the conversion.  This might save someone someone from going thru the
trial-and-error stuff that I went thru.  This will take a few days to put
together, but it will answer questions, on all the fabrication, cooling
system, exhaust routing, and the Mickey Mouse little stuff that I had to
deal with.  I will also show a breakdown of costs.

I will break down the retrofit into 4 posts:

1.      Modifying the bell housing
2.      Modifying the flywheel &amp; fabricating the pilot bushing retainer.
3.      Cooling system and side-hinged decklid fabrication.
4.      Exhaust, gages, alternator/generator, ingnition, and other stuff.

A note to future retrofitters:
In back of your favorite VW magazine is a small ad for Kennedy Engineered
Products. (KEP).  They make quality clutch assemblies and the make VW adaper
kits for every engine imaginable.  Send for their catalog.  It is full of
all kinds of valuable data.  They list every retrofit combination, giving
you HP ratings, engine dimensions, and pros &amp; cons of each one.  The price
of a Kennedy adapter for the Subaru engine is reasonable compared to paying
someone to do the machining, welding, and fabricating.

However if you are a do it yourself type person that can do the work or
knows someone that will help out, the results are almost as professional as
(KEP)'s, and the cost of materials is minimal.

Also, while looking for engines, I picked up a core with a Kennedy VW bell
housing and a nice Type II cross-brace motor-mount setup.  Might be worth
scouting the local boneyards.  If you see a cast bell housing about 1-1/2
inches thick, look for the KEP stamp.
