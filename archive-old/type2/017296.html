Regarding the size of the combustion chambers.
Presuming you have a 2.0L engine.  If the size of the
chamber changes by 1cc the difference in the compression
ratio will change by less than .1.
Probably not enough to worry about.

However, I am a strong believer that you should do what you
think is important to YOUR engine.  It gives you that feeling
of oneness when the baby fires up for the first time.

&gt; FYI, I bought some Mark Stephens heads too, and the combustion chamber
&gt; volumes vary by up to 1 cc.  I thought this was a problem, Mark Stephens
&gt; said it was not important and not to worry about it.  Well, maybe it is,
&gt; and maybe it isn't, but I *am* going to worry about it.  I'm going to
&gt; polish the combustion chambers and round off all the sharp edges (including
&gt; the edge of the combustion chamber itself) and then CC them again and take
&gt; off material until they are all as close as possible.
