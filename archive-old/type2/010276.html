-&gt;Me three on needing wiring advice for blowers! I've got two blowers, but
-&gt;don't know if either work. Been too busy with other things to worry about
-&gt;it (and I'm in Memphis). Frost will make me wonder soon though.

I can't tell you how to hook it up via the relay, but you can hook one up
without it.

There's the pos. and neg. wires coming out from the fan.  I ran the positive
to the coil, and the negative somewhere.  At first I would manual plug it in
before driving away, then unplug once we got there.  Then the bus was
rearended and smushed.  My next bus had it all hooked up.
