Subject: Re: [T2] PUSHROD TUBE SEALANT

everyone is entitled to there opinion i guess and everyone does things there own way.
i see where you are coming from vanagon man but also i was taught this by a very good mechanic and havent had any problems since my engine rebuild from pushrod tubes.
when i did it your way i always ended up with small leaks of oil.
darren if you are timid over this do some research on it but a little temp sealent in my own opinion wont hurt.
darren do what you think is best.
one thing i cant stand is leaky pushrod tubes.
nothing like a oily mess.
i am not telling him to dip them in it but use his finger and coat some around them rings.
maybe i did it wrong and maybe the mechanic that rebuilt my engine after 30 or more years doesnt know nothing either?
good luck darren use your best judgement and sense.
peace
chris
and yes be careful not to crush or bend those tubes cause that can cause wear on your rods.

coating on the sealent they last so much longer...


JEEZUS!!! You guys will never, ever learn. The reason they leaked on you is
becuase you tore them when you put them in. Coating them with silicone is a
really bad idea. It makes a nasty mess for the real mechanic that has to go
into your motor and fix it .....

You have to install the o-rings on the tubes, lube them with oil and that is
it. But when you are pushing them back thru the hear, you have to go
SLOOWWW_dot_using a pair of long pliers to gently twist the tube, watching the
oring that it slips into its hole without tearing on the lip of the
head.........if the oring starts to kink, back off a little and do it again
sometimes something blunt can push the oring where it needs to go.........if
you just bash them in with a spark plug socket they are going to leak.

I once had a local customer (and very prominent listee) call me about this.I
told him how to do it using oil, and guess what...........I am working on
the same motor with caked on silicone, because someone else insured that it
couldnt hurt. Well, I was the &quot;real&quot; mechanic that ended up cleaning that,
and I wasn't too happy about it either.


Well in fact, it sort of does hurt. It ends up in your sump screen, and
jams it up. That viton (hopefully that is what you have) should seat right
on the metal............it expands and contracts right along with the metal
and makes a tight seal.

I say this for I have learned from this error myself, and thru the
preachings of Jake Raby on the type 4 video, Bob Donalds of Boston Engine,
and any other &quot;real&quot; engine rebuilder you can talk to. There is no way they
are going to cake silicone on these orings to seal them.
