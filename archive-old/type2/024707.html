&gt;  The one thing I have been realy dissatisfied with with our '71s is the
&gt;  way they ride in the front.  Even with new shocks, the front ends are
&gt;  definitely higher from the ground when viewed from the side than the
&gt;  rear is.  When you try to use the rear view mirror, you can only see a
&gt;  little ways behind you--it's like you are really tilted up and the
&gt;  mirror is only giving you a view of one car behind you, not as much of
&gt;  the road as it could, like other cars.
&gt;  
&gt;  Would a mirror from another year bus (earlier or later) correct this
&gt;  problem?  Or am I doomed to low visibility in the rear view mirror?  By
&gt;  the way, our local parts guys think I am nuts when I mention this!
&gt;  
&gt;  

Once again this is something that VW themselfs fixed 30 years ago.

There is (were) in fact THREE sizes of rear view mirror availlable - the 
mirror is the same size but the length of the stalk is different. Normaly the 
shortest one was what was fitted and even with the rear of the bus at normal 
ride height these tend to look down on the road.

Over the years I've found 4 or five of the longest arm ones at VW shows just 
chucked in boxes of T2 mirrors I've paid between £1 and £5 for one ($1.60 to 
$8.00 USA) and sold them on to friends for what I paid.

I've never seen one at the medium length.

These long stem mirrors are realy great for improving the rear visibility as 
they allow one to long along the road rather than down onto it.

Its a part well worth looking for in scrap yards and at shows. Keep your old 
mirror and swap back before selling the bus so that your long stem mirror can 
be transfered to a new bus.

The parts book also shows side mirrors with much longer arms but I've never 
seen any.


later....

Al Brase says:
&gt;
&gt; 68-69 mirrors mount lower and have a rubber buffer against the
&gt; windshield, maybe 2&quot; lower.
&gt; I've got a couple of NOS ones around somewhere.
&gt; I'd also agree that you need to have your rear torsion bars set up a
&gt; little.


But, alas, they do not fit in '71, '72, '74 or '79 Type IIs.
I dont know about other years, those are the only ones
I checked. I have a really nice one I grabbed for $2
to put in my '71, but it just wont go. Too small.

I've personaly put these long stem mirrors in '71, '73, '74, '79 and '98 T2s, 
and seen them in other years. Your experience here would suggest that may 
there was a different size for early T2s but they can DEFINITELY be found to 
fit '71 on Loafs right through to current production models
