Subject: Re: 'retractable' seat belts

 &gt;Before you do, weigh the advantages against the disadvantage
which you may not have thought of.
	I assume the 'retractable' is what Kiwis call 'inertial'  -
universal on new vehicles for the past decade or so.  The belt will
reel out at slow rates, but locks up when jerked.  Sounds very
 &gt;attractive ...

Robert,

I believe you kiwis have the advantage of being able to purchase 
&quot;webbing grabber&quot; inertia reel seatbelts not available (aftermarket) 
to mere Aussies. These have the advantages of inertia reel belts but 
do not let out as much belt in a collision. Check out the following:

dogandlemon_dot_com/media/Safety%20PDF/A%20Tragic%20Lack%20of%20Restraint.pdf

&quot;If webbing-grabbers are so effective,
why doesn't the government make
them compulsory when older cars'
seatbelts wear out? In New Zealand,
that's exactly what has happened;
webbing-grabber seatbelts are a compulsory
upgrade for many vehicles
when the existing belts fail the national
Warrant of Fitness safety check.&quot;

Cheers,

Martin.
