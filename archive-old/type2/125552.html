&gt;
&gt; Missing from the current engine is almost all of the EGR system. (DPO
didn't
&gt; think it was needed!  For that mater he left off the Cat and the
&gt; thermostat.)  All that is present of the EGR system is a &quot;J&quot; shaped pipe
&gt; connected to a small block of metal with a cute little lever on it, the
&gt; insides of which are plugged tight with carbon.  Not even the adjustable
rod
&gt; that connects it to the throttle arm is present.
&gt;
&gt; Can anybody point me to a place where I can find the part numbers for the
&gt; EGR system, or even a place that has the parts?
