&gt; Oval, list:
&gt; Good letter, but keep in mind that in addition to the regular parts, Ron, about
&gt; twice a year goes back to the Vaterland and finds stocks of long discontinued
&gt; parts which are available NOWHERE  ELSE IN  THE US! This is a REALLY BIG DEAL
&gt; on such stuff as heat exchangers and rubber gaskets where replacement ones
&gt; don't really fit AT ALL.
&gt; We are so lucky on this list to have Aircooled_dot_net with John, Busboys, and Bus
&gt; Depot with Ron, and VanAgain with Ken (though Ken rarely posts to type2_dot_com). I
&gt; hope I've not left anyone out.

You left out Ronnie at Old Volks Home: http://www.oldvolks_dot_com 
who is a very valuable source and a great guy to deal with.
