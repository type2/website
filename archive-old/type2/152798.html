Subject: Re: [T2] Portland to San Fran. Trip

That trip will be awesome! I've done it twice since I installed my new
engine last august.
 Be forewarned that the Lost coast hwy WILL definitely give your brakes a
big test and put lots of wear on your pads. Make sure to give your bus a
break (no pun intended) every once in a while to let them cool down and give
your foot a rest :) And BTW without stopping too much it took me almost 4
hours to drive it. My high performance engine really didnt help to much, as
the handling of the bus slowed us down.
 If you haven't already, check your brakes (wheel cylinders, calipers,
lines, fluid level etc etc). After I got home from my last trip I replaced
my rear wheel cylinders, as the tab that bolts them to the backing plate had
actually broken off. I am soo lucky that the wheel cylinders didn't get
forced outwards to the drum (and would have locked the wheels up at that
point), I could have been toast, or rolled the bus!! I dont want to scare
you, but if you check it you will be fine, and maybe carry extra brake pads
:) as you never know when you will need them!
 Happy bussing!!!!!
