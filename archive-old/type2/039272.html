Subject: rear hatch

Hi All

I'm slowly going through my bus replacing seals, and I noticed my rear cargo
hatch
rubber looked pretty bad and found some water inside after a rain storm. A
new
seal is ordered.

Upon further examination, I looked at the &quot;line up pivots&quot; that center the
door in its frame.
On the left side its nice and shiney, which shows the hatch rubs against it
when closing. On the
right side, it looks dull and dirty, which tells me its not touching the
door. The door kinda sounds
like its been tweaked to the left, but it functions perfectly fine without
apparent interference.

Is this something to be concerned about? If it is, the correct procedure to
fix? Thanks!

By the way, I've had 3 responses to my fuel capacity question: 14.7,15.2 and
15.8 - I think I'll
stick with 15.5!

Thanks,

Pete
