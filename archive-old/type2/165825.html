Subject: RE: [T2] windshield sill woes

There are several ways to do deal with this (don't use
silicone rubber, won't work).

In order from most expensive/difficult to least:

1) Find a donor windshield lip which includes the
windhsield wiper holes, cut out the bad, weld in the
good.

2) Same as #1, but use a repro replacement panel
(these are avilable).

3) Remove the windshield and seal, clean up the deep
rust, remove as much bad metal as needed, apply rust
converter to the remaining metal, prime, paint, and
allow to dry for several days.  Now use fiberglass to
build up the seal lip to it's original size and shape.
 Paint, then re-install the windshield.  This is a
popular option and works well. If you build an entire
new lip with fiberglass it may prevent the rust from
ever returning.

I have #3 on Pumpkin II


&lt;SNIP&gt;
I think the lip of the sill collapsed or something.
Now I have to find someone other than myself to fix it
