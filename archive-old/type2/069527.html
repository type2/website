Subject: Fuel system setup????

Hi all.
Thank you to everyone who responded to my valve adjustment question.
MY recently aquired '74 bus has a Holly 2bbl carb. The fuel pump
in electrical and makes a rat a tat tat noise sometimes. My
question is &quot;Is this a stock setup?&quot; I have been looking at the
price difference between the mechanical and electrical fuel pumps
and would like to know if i can fit a mechanical one on my bus?

Those not interested in ramblings STOP reading here.

On a side note, I found out that the dufas who I had do my
headliner on my Super Beetle broke my windsheild when 
putting it back in. This just reminds me that if I do it
myself I have noone else to blame. I ASSUMED that because
interiors are his profession he could do a better job than
I. Well the local glass shops want ~$200 so I think i will
attempt to locate a used one. I have several local places to check
before I start asking folks on the Internet. Oh yeah, I will
not be paying MR. Interior a dime. 
I have been missing my motorcycle (I sold to finance my VW habit)
but tomarrow I will get a brief blast as I drive on the highway
for 30 miles with out a windsheild.

Anyone want to buy a '85 Volvo????????? :)
I know it is not a VW but it does start with a V and it is foriegn
to those outside of Sweden.................Chip
