&gt;Hi all,
&gt;my 82 air-cooled westy would not go into 2nd. gear. then it would not go
into 1st.
&gt;This got &gt;worse as I got closer to home. it did not
&gt;want to go into reverse without grinding.  There is plenty of brake fluid
in the
&gt;reservoir.  Any ideas?  The Bentley does not seem to be any help.

Could just be that you forgot to read the maintenance section, probably the
most important section in the book.

Flush and bleed the system before doing anything else. Could be just gummed
and gooked up from not flushing the fluid periodically as required by the
maintenance schedule to prevent this and other hydrolic systems failures.
