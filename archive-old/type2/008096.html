Subject: Re: Aux Battery Locale
Mime-Version: 1.0

If one is willing to put the spare tire on the front or on top, then the
space behind the driver where the spare tire used to be allows a width that
just holds a typical battery (or 2 for that matter)!  I added shelves to
this space and sawed the sides off the stock tire &quot;cover box&quot; so it was
flush and opened just like the stock doors for the sink cabinet.  One can
run heavy wires behind the cabinet to where they are needed, including
running the charging wire thru the closet and into the engine compartment.
Use sealed batteries; if venting is so important, then one could be
installed in the wall at the rear of this storage space.  MB
