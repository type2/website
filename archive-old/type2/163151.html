Subject: Breakdown - Resolution

Changed the fuel filter.  Second time in maybe 2 months.  Black crud
leaking out of the supply side, filtered side not too hot either.

Did not execute tank drain/flush/aerate or anything like that cuz I
put of repairs till 8pm Sunday.

Anyway, it is evident that I've got a tankfull of nasty.  What's the
preferred mechanism for fixation that I can do at home without
dropping tank?

Thanks,

Billy
M'boro, TN

&gt; &gt; Throughout the day yesterday the bus was losing power off the line.  Started
&gt; &gt; with a lag when shifting from 1 to 2.  By the time it was time to drive to
&gt; &gt; school, power had subsided such that I had to ditch it in a parking lot and
&gt; &gt; continue on foot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The symptoms are compatible with a fuel-filter clog, but I just changed it a
&gt; &gt; few weeks ago.  I have another new one on deck that I'll swap in tonight,
