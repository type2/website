Subject: OOOO!! big rust, not good!!! Oh, no!!!

Ok, boys and girls, can you help a brother out?

I just pulled my bus out of storage (storage being under a tarp next to
my garage) and I got under it today, and there's a big old rust hole.
Guess where.   On the front lower beam.  Right at the bottom on the
passenger side where the upright meets it.  It seems to be just in the
outer case.

    I have no idea what this means.  What should I do?  I'm sure this
didn't happen over winter, and I drove it all last summer and didn't
die.  Should I not drive it?  Is it ok to let go until, say after I
drive 2500mi. round trip to Fla.?  Can it be welded?  Do I need a new
beam?  Anyone have a new beam they want to sell for cheap?  '77 westy.

    I'm freaking out here.  My trip is in a month, and I don't want to
drive the Scumdance.

    If maybe this is something you need to see, let me know, I'll get a
picture up right away.

    Thanks.
