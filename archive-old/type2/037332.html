Subject: Westfalia = Campmobile

Volks,

I kinda waited a day or two on this one, but let me say that Campmobile is
the brand name for a camper package manufactured and installed by the
Westfalia Werke.  If you have a set of cabinets with a &quot;Campmobile&quot; label
installed in your bus, they are Westfalia Cabinets and vice versa.  This
is not to say that your bus was originally a Westfalia, because many buses
had cabinets installed in them at a later date.  The Westfalia Werke
installed their campmobile packages in Kombi bodies, so, in the US, if
your VIN says the body was a Kombi, then it is probably an original
installation.

In addition:

if your bed/seat cabinet is bolted to the top of the gas tank compartment
as it ought with nuts welded inside the gas tank compartment, then it was
probably originally a Westy;

if you have a '74-79 and have the poptop that hinges at the rear, then you
probably have a Westy;

if your cabinets/layout are all present and correct for the year of you
body, then you probably have a Westy;

if you have a green plaid full-width bed/seat, and a yellow naugahyde
jumpseat behind the driver and nothing behind the passenger and no poptop
then you probably have a passenger bus in which someone installed some
Campmobile cabinets.

Why do I feel like Jeff Foxworthy all of a sudden? :-)
