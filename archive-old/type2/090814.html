Subject: unsticking slider roof (thanks)

Many thanks to those that responded to the stuck
sunroof question. All said the same thing. Unclip
front of panel and slide back... the manual didnt
convince me that this was the way to do it. 
  So I will attempt the non destructive method of
removal. Document it with pics. an put it out there.

Thanks!
