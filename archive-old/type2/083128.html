Subject: brake reservoir hose

In replacing the master cyl., in my '68, i discovered
the hose between the pipe on the filler reservoir and
the master reservoir was badly deteriorated.

The one I removed is about 12mm i.d. Blue woven
rubber.

Danged if I can find a replacement for it.
My very excellent VW parts guy only has it 7mm. And
says that should fit. But it don't.

I've emailed busboys but haven't heard back yet.

Any other ideas? I'd like to get this brake deal done
this weekend.
