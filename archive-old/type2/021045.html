Tom-
I did this to my 71 bus shortly after I got it.  I had the local parts 
shop get me the dust boots for the caliper pistons, it ran something 
like 22 for them, i forget if that was one side or both though?  This 
was even a small town of 7,000 people, i was suprised they stocked them. 
  They probably fit other cars as well.  Take the calipers off, and the 
pads out and rattle bits out too, then take them down to a shop where 
they can press on the new boots.  Its a pain in the arse, I just took em 
down to a shop to have them press them on and take the old ones off.  If 
there is any corrosion on the pistons, take some super fine sandpaper 
and take it off.  If it is deep pitting, best to get new calipers.  The 
boot kits will also come with 2 litle o-rings that are used to seal the 
2 halves of the caliper together.  Don't split the calipers unless they 
are leaking.  I believe this is what the Bentley manual even said.
Then, compress the pistons after you get the calipers back, and slip in 
the new pads and put the retaining pins back in.
Also, if you need to get the pistons out, I used a lever grease gun with 
a zerk fitting screwed into the caliper where the brake line would 
usually thread in.  Put a small notebook or pad of paper in between the 
pistons though and DON'T have your fingers in the way, otherwise they 
will be promptly cut off, or severely mashed between the pistons.  They 
shoot out of there with some serious force.  Make sure to clean ALL the 
grease out though if you take this route.  Also, make sure not to kink 
the steel brake lines that go to the caliper.  I had to bend mine in 
some awkward ways to get them to fit up right.  In my opinion, a kinked 
line is trash.
Redoing the whole front brakes with lines and all shouldn't take that 
long.  The thing that may take the longest is waiting for the shop to 
press on your new boots.
Also, make sure the parts shop gives you the right pads and what not. 
71-72 is different than 73 and on.  Make sure you got the right stuff.
