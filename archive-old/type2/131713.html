Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

&gt;From: &quot;Mike's Bus&quot;

&gt; &gt;I built my own with 4 wheels. The problem I have the store bought stands 
&gt;is
&gt; &gt;the 3 wheels (they WILL tip on certain surfaces)

&gt;Thanks for the reply...
&gt;I was actually considering welding on another cross member
&gt;To give it more stability when I bench start the motor...

That was the other reason I went with the NorthernTool jobby. It has the 
four wheels, I have used the Type I stand before and thought of many ways to 
reinforce it. Luckily I never had it tip over close though.
