Subject: Can't Adjust Rebuilt Carb (PICT 2)

 Hi all,

 We just got our 68 Bus  on the road after 6 months of undoing the previous
 owners neglect. The engine seems to run terrific. It started right up on
the
 first try without any delay after 6 months of sitting. The problem is that
 the engine is very fumy though there is no visible smoke coming from the
 engine or exhaust (no soot or smoke from the tail pipe). I figured that the
 carb (30 pict 2, which I rebuilt and cleaned thoroughly) just needed to be
 tuned.
 I hooked it up to my tach and vacuum meter and could not get any detectable
 variance in either the idle speed or engine vacuum no matter how far in
either direction
 that I turned the volume control screw. We removed the screw and it looks
 ok.  What gives?

 I did notice that the engine vacuum fluctuated rapidly from about 10 to 15
Hg  at idle (850 rpm) which is a little low I thought but the bus runs great
 with no hesitation, stumbling or stalling and always starts right up.

 Here is what we have done to the motor so far:
 Stock 68 1600 single port fitted with doghouse cooler, fan and shroud.
 53,000 original miles.
 Original pistons rings barrels, crank, case rods, oil  and fuel pumps
 Soaked, air compressor dryed and rebuilt carb (new gaskets, needles etc.)
 Rebuilt heads hemi cut new valves and guides.
 All new stock exhaust (tail pipe heat boxes etc.)
 Swivel balls on stock rockers.
 New clutch, all new engine seals and gaskets.
 New oil pressure relief valve and spring.

 Any help appreciated

 Thanks,
Brett and Jen
