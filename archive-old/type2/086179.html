Subject: them city officials gives me blues

Dang!

wife called today with news that we got the 10 day notice from powers that be to purge the '79 deluxe sunroof resto from our fair city's delicate view.

It's way off the road, kept clean and neat, nextdoor neighbor has no problems.

Anyway, I'm venting and I'm gonna have to stick it in my meager garage where it will take up all space.

Sucks.

Billy
