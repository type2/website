&gt; Hi,

&gt; When I was in India a few years back, many Hotels advertised &quot;Air
&gt; Cooling&quot;.
&gt; This differed from air conditioning in that there was no compressor
&gt; to
&gt; create a cold dispensing inverse radiator. Instead, it used a simple
&gt; law of
&gt; physics. Evaporation is endothermic. The system had a water pump that
&gt; continually kept an air filter damp so that the air that went through
&gt; it
&gt; absorbed energy and cooled the surface of the filter...

You don't have to go to India to see these.  Spend any time in the US
southwest and you'll become familiar with the common &quot;swamp cooler&quot;
that cools air by flowing it through moist filters.

We have toyed with the idea of using this concept for cooling a bus. 
The biggest impediment to this is my reluctance to introduce a
corrosion source to my bus.
