Subject: Vanagon seats

&gt;&gt;The seats should just slide out.._dot_use a rubbet
mallet applied to the back of the seats on the 
solid backing

No no no.  There's some tab or lever along the
track.  You use a screwdriver or something on it.
 Seems like it might have been in the rear of the
track.  I'm sorry I cannot be more specific
because its been awhile.
