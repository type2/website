Seasons Greetings to All!

Just redid the adjustment on my rear torsion bars (I wouldn't recommend
just doing one click blind, my new yoko's got 17k miles and looked like
firestones due to them being too sprung from one outer click).  Used a
kiddie protractor and got it right and applied baby powder to avoid sqweeks
(another suggestion last time I didn't and she sqweeked).

Only problem was that I sheered the one of the two screws that held the
right side bearing/shaft stub/drum to the swing lever.  There are two bolts
with nuts there that I removed first and when I removed the screws they
stripped rubbing there way by the swing lever which had positioned itself
to partially block the way.  Live and learn.

Anyways, I brought the screw down to the local nut and bolt and he gave me
a mirror image for $4.50.  Is this reasonable?  It is a rugged screw but...


Clueless in Pascagoula,
