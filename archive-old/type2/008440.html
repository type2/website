Ok so I read in digest mode, so its not friday anymore but bear with me.
I originally was going to post a reply to the sender but thought all of 
you might be interested.
The question was about getting insurance discounts for insuring more 
then one vehicle. Seeing as how we bus types may own many vehicles, or 
may drive various ones throughout the year and keep some, sell others, I 
offer this advice.
You can get insurance as a driver. In effect you are insuring yourself 
to drive any car. The cost I found is no more then insuring a specific 
car. Hence you solve the problem &quot;I can only drive one at a time why 
charge me for more then one&quot;? This is nice to have because you can test 
drive a potential bus, a friends car, and any of your own without 
dealing with reinsuring or dropping insurance.
Ask your insurance carrier. If they dont know how, go to an insurance 
broker. This person handles many companies and usually can find you the 
best price.
Jason S.
