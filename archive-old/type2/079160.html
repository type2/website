Subject: No pump-a fuel

grumblegrumblegrumble

My fuel pump (Brazilian for earlier engines -- the kind with the screws all 
around) was leaking so I replaced it with an old German fuel pump (the kind 
with one screw in the top) I had lying around.  It didn't work, so I trashed 
it.  

I bought a new fuel pump, a Bocar (and presumably the pushrod that goes with 
it), and installed it on Lurch this morning.  It doesn't work.

Are the hoses not hooked up right?  

Did I get the wrong pushrod?  It's part # 113 127 307 A and it's shorter than 
the one that I took out.
