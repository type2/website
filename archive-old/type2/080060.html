&gt; &lt;&lt; Would Load class &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; tire be more resistant to punctures than a
&gt; regular passenger type tire?
&gt;
&gt; Sort of like a work boot versus a sneaker?
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Only if it's kevlar-belted. There's a product called &quot;Slime&quot; (not kidding...)
&gt; for tires that claims to prevent flats from punctures.

Slime works great, but I only use it in tires with tubes.  It would work
in a tubeless tire, but if you use it you will never be able to use a
conventional repair on the tire.

It's also a mess when you dismount the tire.  The tire guy will be p*ssed.
