Subject: Re: [T2] Re: POR 15 Corrosion Control Process

James,
I wasen't deeming anything correct.
I was explaining  was what is correct from a  professional standpoint.

I have found out in life one person's quest to get the job done &quot;right&quot;
isn't always the proper way.

As an example--it's just like the one man's definition of the word
&quot;Mint&quot;.

I've seen a bunch of advertised &quot;mint&quot; vehicles--that belonged in a bone
yard--
 
So--with this in mint--the Slick 50 of the body work profession is just
a temporary band aide--and not the final solution.

If this stuff worked out for your quest for an OK quick fix job --great.

The stuff is just a back yard cave and pave job, and I wouldn't never
use it on any client's vehicles--nor would any other body shop--

( Not that I am aware of anyway )

This says a bunch---
