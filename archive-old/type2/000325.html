&gt; Finally, can anybody comment on price of new cv boots?
&gt; One place wants hour labor/side or ~$125 total. Other
&gt; place wants ~$240 total!


Well, you're looking at $40 in parts (from me), including German CV boots,
grease, and hardware; maybe about $5 more if you include the socket you need
to remove the bolts. Do it yourself if you want to save a few bucks; it's
not a difficult job at all but seriously messy. Have plenty of WD40 or Kroil
handy if those bolts have been in there a while. And buy a service manual if
you don't have one already. You'll need one sooner or later anyway. In
either case, do it soon, before dirt gets in through the cracked boots and
ruins the CV joints themselves.  It does take a couple of hours to do, so
$125 seems reasonable, but only if they're giving you nice German boots for
the price. $240 seems a bit steep.
