&gt; Hey All,
&gt; I am replacing the fuel line on 71.  About 2 ft from the tank, I had a fuel
&gt; filter, then some line connected to the steel tube line.
&gt; Does this filter need to be there?  Or is it advised?

Often you will find a filter there, but it wasn't put there by  VW.  You
usually don't want to put a filter on the suction side of the pump.

If you do run one there, make sure it is a big one (not one of those
little plastic ones) and that it is replaced regularly.
