Subject: swing arm repair kit 1977 Bus (steering)

'ello Volks,
The steering in my 77 westy got really bad over the last week, so i crawled 
under there, per muir, and had my associate wiggle the steering wheel and 
regular front wheels. the center pin (kingpin) had a lot of twist in the 
side to side up down kind of way. So, i tried loosening the nut on the drag 
link, compressing the pin, and retightening. I was unable to gain more than 
about 2 mm of progress. So, i went to my local VW Auto Parts Place (HALSEY 
AUTO in Portland OR, an excellent place) and explained my dilemna. The 
counter dude said i need the swing arm repair kit, they will have it in 
later today. Has anyone done this job before, any advice, warnings, special 
tools? Thanks!
-jeremy
