Westy Campers built during the  1968 thru 1973 model years were made from
sunroof kombis (model 23.) which have support pans below the cargo floor to
counteract the hole in the roof that results in  reduced frame stiffness.
The buses were supplied to Westfalia without the sunroof cover or the
sliding mechanism. They were only delivered on sunny days :)

I know of at least one person who has removed the pop top from his 1971
Westy and installed the sunroof from a 1978 sunroof standard bus. It is a
perfect fit althought he is currently battling some leaks. I am not certain
if he got the four drain hoses installed.

The sunroofs cover(metal) is the same from 1968 to 1979. I am not certain if
there were detail changes in the operating mechanism. The last that I heard
was that you cannot get the operating cables anywhere. You need to scavenge
them from a junked bus if yours are messed up. Check West Coast Metric for
seals, gears and handles.

If anyone feels the need to remove the stock sunroof from a bus and install
a Westfalia or other poptop it can be done. There is not much the hinge
mechanism on a 1968 to 1973 setup however I cannot say for certain about the
1974 and up.  Please note that 1974 and up Westy are SUBSTANTUALY reinforced
to make up for the rather lorge hole (they are not stock sunroof buses) that
was cut in the roof. I would not cut anything out that VW left in. If you
want a larger 1974 to 1979 pop top then live with the smaller hole.

There are stories in the archives about people doing this sort of thing
successfully. Poor Richard even installed a 1975 poptop on his 1967(split)
camper. I think he got the sawzall on it though.

Regarding the rarity of sunroof buses, who knows , all the ones that I see
are caulked shut for some odd reason:)
