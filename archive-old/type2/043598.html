Subject: RE: Locking engine hatch

I'd be very interested in getting a rear hatch latch.  Is is possible to
get the tumbler keyed to the current locks on my bus?

My '74 came with a locking engine hatch. The key is the same as the doors. I
assumed it was original, but really have no idea.... It is nice to be able
to lock it down though.
