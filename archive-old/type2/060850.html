My brother, the real mechanic in the family (as opposed to those
of who like to pretend) tells me that the right way is use the
other car to charge your battery (ignition off). Disconnect.  Start.
Otherwise you have duelling controllers/regulators and something's
likely to blow.  Knowing how he likes to blow things up, I choose
to believe him.
