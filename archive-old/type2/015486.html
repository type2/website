&gt;I am replacing my carb with a brand new one from Bus Depot for my Bus. 
&gt;However, my question is this: My '70 engine is a dual-port with a &quot;30/31 
&gt;Pict&quot; carb and am wondering if there will be any problems with changing to 
&gt;the 34-Pict-3 carb the Depot is selling?

Depends. If you now have a 34Pict manifold with the adaptor for use of the
30/31, just take off the adaptor and install the 34. If, however, you have
a 30/31 manifold, you will need a 34 manifold to install the new carb. I
haven't heard of an adaptor to convert the 30/31 manifold to the 34 carb.

Others on the list will know more.
