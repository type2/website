Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection System Cleaning

I've used paint thinner and a rag to clean things up nicely.  Since all this
stuff was designed to (occasionally) get sprayed with gasoline I figure a
mild solvent like paint thinner would do no harm.

Subject: [T2] Fuel Injection System Cleaning


&gt; Thanks to John Baker I now have a complete FI system and I am preparing to
&gt; install it this week. I have been cleaning the various parts and have a
&gt; question. No I am not going to be using Sea Foam on this one. The harness
&gt; has a lot of Guck around it and I want to know what others may have used
to
&gt; clean it. I don't want to corrode it, or melt the wire casings. Would this
&gt; be a place for mild soap and warm water? Water a bad idea? Simple Green,
&gt; Purple Power, Clorox? TIA.
