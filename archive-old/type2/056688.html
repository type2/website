Subject: tranny fluid

Hi

I just changed my tranny fluid again, this time it actually helped.

Just thought I'd mention that sta-lube is crap, and the pump is a PITA.
Mineral oil just doesn't cut it...

Could just be that the bus is supposed to have 80 or 80-90 weight and
the sta-lube was 85-90, but I didn't think it made that big of a
difference, but maybe it does... After I put in the sta-lube my
transmission was grinding into first and second gear.

Went back and bought some valvoline 80-90 *petroleum* oil in the
squeezable quart sizes, got it in there in less than half the time it
took screwing around with that stupid pump and the retarted sta-lube
containers.

My tranny shifts better than ever now... 

I saw the sta-lube and the pump recommended in the archives, so I
thought I'd throw in my 2 cents and save someone else the trouble... 

Jeff
