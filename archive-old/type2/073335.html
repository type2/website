&gt; anyone had
&gt;any experience with these guys??

&gt; like Wal*Mart can offer stuff cheaper than some little
&gt;local outift...you know...quantity...

Uhh....a good portion of what WalMart serves up is junk,
Just like the alternator stand that came with the conversion kit I bought
&gt;from SoCal a couple of years ago.  Sure, they were ~$10 cheaper than
everywhere else on the kit.

The stand was just plain crap - the saddle the alternator sits in was
*not* paralell with the base, and the height was off too.  It was really
bad cheap junk.  After mucho phone hassle, and sending the part back to
them (on my dime, as I recall), I did get reimbursed for the part.

I ended up with a factory piece from the junkyard.

The reman Bosch alternator is still working fine.
