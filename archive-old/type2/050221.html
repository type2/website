Bailcast 'sticky boots' are a special split-gaiter for CV joints, which 
overlap around the joint and the overlap is bonded using an adhesive 
supplied with the kit.

An illustrated article in a past issue of VW Motoring magazine (I can't 
remember which month or year, but I still have the copy somewhere), a few 
years ago, gave a favourable review of this kit.

It enables the CV gaiter to be fitted, without either dismantling the CV 
joint or removing it from the drive flanges. However, this is only 
practical, if one can be sure that no dirt or grit have found their way into 
the CV joint.

Regards.
