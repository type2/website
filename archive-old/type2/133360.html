&gt; So far I've received the following quotes:
&gt;
&gt; (all for 6 months of coverage)
&gt;
&gt; Geico $511
&gt; Progressive $507
&gt; Allstate $360
&gt; State Farm $305
&gt;
&gt; Do these seem reasonable?
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone gotten a better deal with another carrier or are there any
&gt; tricks out there?  i.e. &quot;motorhome insurance&quot; ?

check out MetLife (Snoppy's insurance) they have pretty good rates, I got
my wifes' car and my bus covered for less than the big companies wanted
for my wifes car alone.. I got an assigned value policy for only an extra
$200 year
