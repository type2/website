&gt; &gt; I've done two N-Scale buses in tinted clear resin.  I was making

&gt; One of the things on my &quot;list of things I'll never have time to try&quot; is to
&gt; scratchbuild a *WORKING* N scale VW Bus.

and I thought I had it hard, I have been beating around the idea of an &quot;O&quot;
scale bay window bus.  (&quot;O&quot; fine scale not lionel toy trains) that is only
1:48 scale

&gt;
&gt; N scale is 1:160
&gt; Z scale is 1:220
&gt; 1/2 Z scale is 1:440
&gt;
&gt; There are actually working 1/2 Z trains so I know a working N scale
&gt; automobile is possible.
&gt;

HZ ?   1:440, don't think my eyes could even find it much less build it!
