Subject: Generator Light

Howdy,

Well I cleaned up all of the connectores and ground points

around the engine and reconnected all and low and behold the 

generator light comes on and then goes out. :)  I am getting 

around 14V at the generator and around ~12V at the battery 

and regulator.  Does this look normal?  Also I have bled the

brakes again with the suggestions from the list but the pressure

still slowly goes away.  I will replace the master cylinder tonight.

Thanks for the input,

Stephen
