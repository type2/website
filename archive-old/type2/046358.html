The original version of this aggregation/conglomeration [sold under the same
or very similar name] was a total disaster, and resulted in some
class-action suits as I recall.  It used a Rabbit power train and the
engines were failing with just a few thousand miles on them.  The beast was
finally taken off the market.  Used units still pop up from time to time,
and a new generation of folks get suckered.

Granted the new version uses the VR-6 power train, but once again it's being
asked to move a weight and volume far beyond the engine and transaxle's
original design parameters.  Time will tell.....

&gt;&gt;  Yes, the camper you mention is currently being produced jointly with
Volkswagen and Winnebago. The thing is called a &quot;Rialta&quot;. It uses the
Volkswagen VR6 Eurovan mechanics, attached to the rear designed by
Winnebago. It is fully self contained, with a shower, toilet, etc. They are
in the US$45,000 and up price range.  &lt;&lt;
