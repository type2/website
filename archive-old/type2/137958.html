Subject: Retorquing heads and 'making it purdy'

As I pull through the last few preliminaries (and Gantt charting) 
before starting my rebuild, I wanted to float a decision I've made 
before the list.

My engine compartment isn't too bad looking, but I'd like it shined up 
like Ratwell's and others I've seen on the Samba. But I am also anxious 
to get this engine built and running because once I can pull it out of 
the garage (known locally as &quot;the barn&quot;) I can clear out all kinds of 
crazy refuse that I and previous homeowners have accumulated there, and 
make for better working conditions.

I decided that the thing to do is to break the engine in, take care of 
the trash, and then pull the engine. At that point I will retorque the 
heads (a recommended procedure, but one that I suspect is often 
neglected) and do the beautifying then.

Makes sense to me, but is there any flaw in my logic?
