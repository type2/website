Subject: Re: [T2] Refurbished?

Mark,

Here is an interesting exercise.  Go find a calculator on the net that 
will tell you what $7,000 is worth in 2004 inflated dollars.

In 2002 inflated dollars $7,000(price of a new 78 std) is a little over 
$20,000.

Hmmmm....my restored 78 Champagne edition was appraised at just under 
$20,000...not that I ever expect to get that for it, but was interesting 
nontheless.

I'm afraid to figure out what I spent on the restoration.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Anyone know whether anybody has tried to provide &quot;refurbished&quot; buses 
&gt; (or any vehicle, for that matter)? It would be nice to go to a 
&gt; refurbisher -- not a restorer -- and buy a baywindow for, say, $6000 to 
&gt; $10000 with maybe a two-year parts and labor guarantee.
&gt; 
&gt; If someone did this is large quantities, it ought to be possible.
