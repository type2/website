Hey Todd.  If your cylinder in the caliper doesn't move, it will need to be
repaired/replaced.  You should be able to push the piston in with a pair of
channel lock pliers.  I'd check the master cylinder as well.  Squeaking is
caused by vibration of the pads on the disc.  Kinda sounds like microphone
feedback at a rock concert.  That is where the goop you find on the back of the
old pads comes in.  It's designed to absorb the vibrations and thus quiet it.
There's a multitude of products that are sold as Disc Brake Quiet.  It's a sort
of glue that doesn't harden.  (except for over long periods)   I just put new
pads on the westy and did a real quick 20 min job, ( I love the simplicity and
design of these vehicles), replacing the pads only and didn/t put the stuff on
and guess what,  they're noisier than ever before.  When the weather warms up,
I'll do the compleat job.  With a properly operating brake system,  these
vehicles stop nicely.
    Keep in mind, If You Can't Stop It, Don't Drive It.
If this is your only vehicle to get you to Houston, I'd be very careful.  Don't
play around with the brakes if you're not able to fix them.  I'd suggest a ride
from someone for your treatment.  then when you get back and feel better, you
can go at the problem at your own pace.
    I wish you luck in Houston.  Keep your mind strong and your body will
follow.
