So, likely you've got &quot;whatever&quot; going on, getting smoke/exhaust (? - better 
differentiate, some suggested getting a CO meter for the cab; anyhow, watch 
out for:  headaches, red skin, no pulse...), and your heat flaps don't fully 
close, to boot.

Where are you at?  If you can winter over w/out the connecting ducts 
(exchanger to heat flaps - i.e. won't need heat OR defrost), you could just 
disconnect until you opt to investigate further.  However, if it is oil that 
is burning/producing smoke, you might opt for investigating sooner rather 
than later.

If smell continues to diminish, it may have been buildup from sitting for 
awhile (per Nikki - happened to her from 4 mo. inactivity) and you needn't 
twiddle w/further.  I would check things out, anyways.

   Does the smoke stop if you turn off the heat?  No it does not.....the 
smoke keeps coming out slowly. The heat has been off (100+ degree weather in 
the last few days). But I did notice that it is diminishing slowly.
