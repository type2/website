There were some key words in your post.  Your friends _race_ large
motored VWs.  You also said that you want a everyday driver and low
maintainance bus.

The two are hard to mix.  Those large motors don't last all that long,
particularly if you are asking them to put out lots of power all the
time, as you would be in a bus.

For a daily driver, I'd stick to a stock 1600 displacement.  It is
understressed, which is a good thing because you often ask it to put
out max power for long periods.

If you really want a big motor, be prepared to spend big bucks to
build it properly.  Speed costs money, how fast do you want to spend!
