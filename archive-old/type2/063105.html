Subject: all this waving business

Joe says:

&gt;Waving has way more to do with the culture in which you're
&gt;traveling than with the type of vehicle you drive.

....And I agree, to a point.

However, my wife and I were driving thru Arkansas a few years ago to see her relatives in Centerville/Dardanelle/Russellville area, and we waved.  And waved.  And waved some more.  We got few if any returns.  I was not a happy camper, as I was used to the incessant waving encountered near my grandparent's farm in West TN.  I had heard central AR was a friendly place.  Maybe it was me.  Maybe it was our car (her parents' new Grand Am (a.k.a. Grand Mistake). I don't know. 

 Anywho, I enjoy the simple art of waving, but I'd rather wave at farmers and hillbillies than at urbanites.  I guess I'm just a country boy at heart.  I do no-tice that the younger generation of country folks are less willing to acknowledge my presence, except for the occasional glare.....(&quot;It's one of them &quot;fern&quot; cars, Lester! Must be one of them hippie-types!&quot;)

My grandparents will never understand my passion for german engineering.
