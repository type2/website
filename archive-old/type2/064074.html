&gt; Here's the problem: my '73 bug gets horrible gas mileage (15-17 mpg in the
&gt; city). Here's what I've done to try and remedy the problem:Here's a question that has been bothering me for over 20 years, and I 
wonder if anyone could help me figure it out.

In 1974, I traded for a 1960 VW bug (late 60), with 2 engines. This bug 
still had the reserve tank (for those not familar, when the car would 
start to sputter, you'd reach down and flip a lever, giving enough added 
range to reach a gas station). I pulled the engine, and put 1 together 
with the best parts from the two. (Yes, compression was low, but just 
within allowable ranges). I planned on bringing the car with me when I 
got out of basic training, but it didn't work out. The left front was 
smashed by a hit-and-run driver, while it set on the curb, so it was 
sold.

Before I went in the service, I got the bug running, but it got terrible 
mileage... something like 6 to 8 mpg. I don't see how it could have 
pumped that much fuel through such a little engine. I checked for leaks, 
but it didn't even leak oil. I had a friend follow me, and there was not 
black smoke, nor was there gas in the oil. The timing was correct 
(verified statically, and with a timing light). The choke was opening 
properly... everything I could think of.

I wish I'd trailered it with me, just to figure out this mystery (but it 
was on the west coast, my next assignment on the east).

I'd really appreciate any help with this one.
