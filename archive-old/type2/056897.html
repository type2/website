Subject: Balljoints by Formtechnic?

Hi there!

 Went to my local VW parts shop (http://home.kolumbus.fi/~molly) today to
get a new balljoint for my -71 Kombi. They sold me a new brand wich i´ve
never heard off before. The printing on the box says: FORMTECHNIC
Fuhrungslenke Suspension joints. Does that mean they are german made? Has
anybody tried theese? Will they last longer than the brazilian crap I got
last time?

TIA
