Subject: Re: Need Some Options on Carbs

Here's a question for everyone... what kind of mileage do you get with 
your VW van? Our '65, from the day it was new, never got better than 17 
MPG (1500cc). Granted, it was driven 70mph on road trips (65mph after 
the rebuild, 'cause it wouldn't do 70 any longer)... but I'm reading 
some vans are batting down 25 to 30 mpg?

My '73 had dual carbs, but they were changed out when they went bad. 
When properly adjusted, the originals gave good mileage and power, but 
that faded off when they weren't balanced. When I went to a single 
Weber, the engine ran stronger, but was a bear to get started when temps 
dropped below 40.

&gt; hey now,
&gt; 
&gt; i'm tired of the single weber carb on my '74 1800cc bus. didn't the 74 have
&gt; dual carbs as stock? i believe mine was changed by a FPO. i'm not getting good
&gt; gas milage (16-18mpg) on an rebuilt engine with about 800 miles. i know i'm
&gt; not gonna get great milage on the rebuild...but what should i expect?
&gt; 
&gt; everything is timed and accurate, valves set to .006, carb set correctly, new
&gt; points, etc etc. i've never got good milage on this van. even before the
&gt; rebuild.
&gt; 
&gt; it is my understanding that with dual carbs i'll get better milage and more
&gt; power. how much, i'm not sure. so, should i go to dual or try a different
&gt; single carb...or does mine need rebuilding?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
