Subject: New items and interest

    I just recieved brand new German JAILBARS for the rear windows, these
were made from the original tooling. I have a question though part number
241 853 445 is the center support for the 64 through 67, but can anybody
tell me what part number 255 853 445 fits? My importer has the 255 labeled
as early. We are also looking to getting the angled bay window side bars. I
also recieved the rear seat luggage brackets and bar, but they didn't send
the tube end caps, can't wait to see if they are plastic or aluminum. Prices
on these are not available yet.
   On another note, I am wondering what the interest would be on complete
pre bent brake line kits made out of stainless steel.
These would be available for all years of buses and I allready have them
coming for bugs. These would be complete kits with all lines pre bent.
Approx cost on these would be somewhere around $175.00 per kit.
   I will also have individual lines available (made to order for the time
being) out of stainless in 2 weeks.
