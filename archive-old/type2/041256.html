Subject: gas tank removal, 1974 bus

Brightest Blessings Volks,

I am doing a gas tank transplant in my 1974 transporter bus currently, and
with this year, it's standard that the engine has to be dropped in order to
access the gas tank.

I have everything off the firewall, all the screws out, even the ones under
the bus into the firewall, everything disconnected, duel carbs off....

Now can someone sort of guide me through the rest of the procedure?  I'm
having a terrible time with the archives.

If any kind soul out there is experienced with rust gas tank problems and
transplants with buses from 1974, please write me personally, I'm be
everlastingly Grateful!

Happy, Smiling, VW's....
