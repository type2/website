Subject: Engine dies   :)      Weber carb now


I removed my single weber carb and cleaned it up. I blew it out and looked
it over. The floats seem to work and there is a pointy needle that stops the
gas flow. That works. I cleaned the gas screen on the carb.

Holding the carb in my hand, I attached the fuel line to the carb and the
fuel pump (temporary electric) comes on I can see the gas bubbling through
the filter. I now realize that the chamber fills with gas. It does I am
sure. When I open the throttle all the way gas sprays out of the bottom of
the carb in a burst, but thats all unless I close the throttle and open it
again. Should the gas keep coming out if I leave the throttle held open? Or
am I lacking vacum from the engine or something? To a person who doesn't
know it seems the gas should keep flowing out. I'd like to know before I
tear it down further or bolt it back on for a test so thanks for any
insight!!

If it is supposed to keep flowing there must be something else clogged I
didn't notice.

(spark and fuel all the way to the carb has been established..thanks)
