Subject: Counting Busses

1979 Westy

Still don't know what exact &quot;model&quot; I have, after 6 months ownership....
it's been called a Campmobile.

Anyone know of a good book on the history, all the different models, etc,
of Westies, or for that matter busses in general?  Sure would make a
fascinating read!!


Roger
