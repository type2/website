&gt; I went to a local hardware store and found a chrome sink accessory plug and used it.  I recall they had a size that just fit it even though I had to work with it a little.  The plug I'm talking about is the thing that looks like a quarter and if you have a stainless steel sink that should have a hose sprayer with it (but it doesn't)...this plug would be used to plug up the hose sprayer hole.  I hope that makes sense.  Greg

YEAH I know those things GREAT IDEA!!!!!

thanks
