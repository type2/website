Subject: Re: Ship VW motor from AZ to PA:  Inexpensive Options?

Common carrier (truck line) may be your most realistic option, but it won't
be cheap. I have seen engines banded  to an old tire (with those steel
bands) and shipped by truck. Otherwise, maybe you should advertise for
someone going that way with space for a rider?
