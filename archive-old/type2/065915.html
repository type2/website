Alright deary, time to bring out the kindling and get this flicker going.
I want to relate a tale from a workmate of mine that should add fuel 
to the fiery discussion on smog stuff.  He bought a used flatbed 
truck at an auction of a local utility company.  When time came ot 
get it checked for smog, he was told that he needed several hundred 
dollars worth of additional smog equipment installed first.  ???
Apparently if you are a FLEET owner, you can buy, own and operate 
vehicles that emit greater smog than us regular folks.  He purchased 
it for use by his company, not for private use, and they still 
required him to upgrade the engine.  We still live by the golden rule.
Them's that have the gold, rule.
