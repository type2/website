&gt; Slop it on today--drive it today situation.

&gt; And by simply wiping a wet sponge--or rag saturated with some metal
&gt; prep, by Dupont, will do this job well.
&gt;
&gt; Let it dry--and apply a coat of zinc chromate acid etch primer--Vari
&gt; Prime by Dupont is about the best you can use.
&gt;
&gt; Now you can prime it with any high fill sealer / primer, I like Sherwin
&gt; Williams Ultra Fill, or I have been also using a urethane 3 part primer
&gt; / sealer by Dupont called Uro Prime.

Now I know why folks use the &quot;other&quot; stuff, just back from my friendly
local neighborhood Dupont supplier,  for a quart of the above agents out
the door with taxes, at probably full retail price it was over $200

&gt; This stuff is like putting a plastic bag over the repaired area--it's
&gt; bullet proof, attracts zero moisture as all of the clay / talic based
&gt; primer's do.

I sure hope so..... will it matter if I put a light coat of black primer
over the work until Sept....
