Subject: Re: [T2] Report...trip to germany

&gt; Interesting pics....
&gt; The bus in 2 and 3 is a combo of parts, appears to
&gt; be a 73-75 but has a 76-79 engine lid lock and 78-79
&gt; Champagne bumper rubbers.

It is hard to say when this bus was built. Judging
from the engine-hatch hinges I would say it is a
modelyear 1973-1976 bus.

The bumper rubbers were available in Europe ever since
the square shaped bumpers were introduced in august
1972 and available until the end of production, so
they could be original for this vehicle.

&gt; I thought the small Euro pop top was 68-72?

As far as I know the small top wasn't delivered on
Westies that came straight from the factory. A lot of
Westies here are Kombi's that were converted to
campers later on with a Westfalia-camper kit (often
called &quot;Mozaik&quot;).

The small 'mushroom' pop-top is also found on later
buses. A friend of me has a 1975 Ames-Kador camper
which also has this poptop. It was installed By
Ames-Kador in 1975 for as far as we know.

&gt; chrome front and rear turn signals are different.
&gt; That greenish car in the top left of 5 and in 6
&gt; reminds me of a NSU Prinz. Any idea what it was?

Indeed, it looks like an NSU Prinz, but I suspect it
is an Alfa-Romeo Guilia when you look at the
tail-lights.

&gt; I would love to know the &quot;M code&quot; for #7.....

So would I :-)
