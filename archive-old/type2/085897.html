Subject: Re: [T2] how to remove front door????




&gt;hello,
&gt;
&gt;i need to know how to remove the front passenger door
&gt;on a 76 bus. the two pairs of bolts are easy, however
&gt;there is some sort of bar towards the bottom or the
&gt;door which connects door to vehicle, cant figure out
&gt;how to get it free.
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance, as per. any and all insights,
&gt;answers, or opinions will be greatly appreciated.
&gt;thanks again.
&gt;

Matty,
	There is a rod that holds the door half of the check-rod in place.  At the 
bottom of the rod there should be an 'E' clip holding the rod in place.  
Remove the 'E' clip and pull the rod out.  You should be door-free!

	Eron Crites
