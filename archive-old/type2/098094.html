&gt;&gt; My '71 resents your epithet.  It prefers the term &quot;stately&quot;.
&gt;&gt; 1600s push buses very nicely.  No, not a performance engine, but there
is
&gt;&gt; no VW engine that will give a bus &quot;high performance&quot;.&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Oh really? wanna try and stick with my bus while I'm doing 90 down the
&gt; Interstate with my below average Type 4 engine? Your 1600 cc dp do that?

I'm sorry, I don't have the excess testosterone needed to do that.

If I wanted to race, I wouldn't have a bus.  Even with a type 4 engine, a
bus is no rocket.
