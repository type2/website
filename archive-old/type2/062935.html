Subject: Re: Who's going to Jerome?

&gt;I'm seriously considering the Jerome trip.  There's a Splitty club out here
&gt;that's going to caravan out and I may join along.  Can anyone tell me if
&gt;there's anything to be aware of for this trip?  Is it a bare bones camp site
&gt;set up?  Any showers?  Restrooms?  Can anyone out there expound on what we're
&gt;in for?  Other list members may be considering.

 Considering you're from Riverside, I am forced to tell this story of gloom
and doom. Not really, more like havoc and hard times with a double order of
deprevation.

 Back a long time ago, they had the first California Jam. 

 Anybody else or am I dating myself? Crosby, Stills and Nash?

 I'm one of those paranoids who doesn't cross the street without a
lunch box and a water flask.

 This was at the Riverside race-way which is actually in Santa Anita
I think. Has seating and facilities for about a zillion people.

 I,m taking 4 teen age girls and my wife. She was a teener too.
Well almost.

 We are doing our usual &quot;packing for the trip&quot; stuff and she waves 
the water jugs and t-paper and first aid etc at me and I said &quot;we
won't need that stuff, the place has facilities for thousands and 
thousands&quot;.

 So off we go. I won't get into all the misery of the day but it seems
in all their wisdom, all facilities are locked for the concert.
 
 No restrooms. About 4 portable toilets for about 400k fans.

 One water fountain.

 People were out on the race track holding a blanket up around the little
woman so she can take a whiz or whatever.

 The water situation was so bad they ran a helicopter in and were 
throwing gallon jugs of water down at the mob.

 Ever been bombed with a gallon of water from a hundred feet?

 Now we had casualties.

 On a more personal note, I'd been carrying this big ice chest full of
food since 4 am and we finally found a spot around 1pm.
 
 It was against a chain link fence on the inside of the track.
I put my chest down and leaned back in total exhaustion.

 A dog used me for a fire hydrant.

 There are several morals here: 
 
 Buy the record it's cheaper and you can actually hear the music.  

 Take your &quot;stuff&quot; with you everywhere.

 Bring extra clothes to concerts.

 Stay the hell out of California, they insane.

 And don't lean on chain link fences.

 Never let teen age girls talk you into anything.

 Although money is important, so are surgical instruments and a snake
bite kit.

 I may have missed a few.
