Subject: Re: Getting off Lug Nuts (was: Helping a Fellow Vw'er)

&gt; A sears Craftsman (replace at any Sears) breaker bar and socket, my foot and
&gt; the rest of me on top of it,  have been enought to get off all the lug nuts
&gt; I've tried. Mind you I have had to bounce on the end of the bar a time or two.
&gt; Good luck all.

At one point in time I had the following vehicles:
'64 deluxe, '67 deluxe, '64 Baja Bug and wanted to trade some tires 
around.  So I get my socket, a breaker bar and a 4ft 1/4&quot; wall pipe that
weighed about 50 pounds by itself.  I was working in an apartment 
complex covered parking area.  That means that I had the ability to 
hang onto the ceiling to gain balance while jumping on the extension 
bar.  After moving a few wheels around I came to one on the '67 (a 
real hunkajunk, but that's another series of stories).  I jumped and 
jumped and bent the bar.  Got a REAL STURDY bar and continued 
jumping.  I got all the lugs off, except one.  Gave up and sold it 
that way.  Never liked that bus anyway.
