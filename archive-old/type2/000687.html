I announced last month that black Westy cabinet handles were once again
available.  Now I am happy to report that I received my first shipment of
gray ones as well (stock color for earlier 70's Westies).  Same price and
details (see below). A gray-specific part number should be on the website
sometime tomorrow; in the meantime you can use the part number below and
just specify GRAY in the comments section of the web order form.  I will
extend the $8.95 listmember price on both colors thru the end of the month.

&gt; Finally, after promising these to you for months, I can finally
&gt; deliver :-) These are the cabinet door/drawer handles for the '68-79
&gt; Westfalia campers, in black.  (Gray to be available sometime in the
future.)
&gt; They include the handle, the pushbutton, the metal pushrod and plastic
&gt; triangular piece it attaches to (in other words, all the parts that
typically
&gt; break), but not the latch itself.
&gt;
&gt; Price is $8.95 each including list member discount.  Part number
&gt; is 231 070 965 . If you order via the website, the price will come up
higher
&gt; ($9.95), but if you specify in the comments section that you are a list
&gt; member the list discount will be deducted when the order ships.  Of
course,
&gt; you can also e-mail or call your order in.
