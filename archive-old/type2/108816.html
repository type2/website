Subject: 1978 GE case

Hello all,
new dilemma.
I recently acquired a 78. The case is a GE, which my reading tells me is the
California model.  I am unclear of what &quot;California&quot; stuff is still on it. The
engine is a rebuilt bottom end from Strictly Foreign out in California.  Are
they still in business??
Anywhooo, there are only 2,800 miles on this rebuild.  I am experiencing a
tremendous amount of blow by.  The breather hose is soaked in oil.  I have oil
blowing up all over the back of the bus, and I am coating the vehicles that
travel behind me.  There doesn't appear to be a tremendous amount of usage,
but that oil mist is a mess for those behind me, and the rear hatch of my
bus.

Questions...
Where is the oil coming from that blows up the rear hatch?  (not out of the
exhaust, I have checked)

Where do I begin to look and clean this rascal up

What causes so much blow by.


Kind Regards,

Frank E Biffath III
