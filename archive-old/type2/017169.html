Let me guess, there is oil all over the back of the van.

My guess is a broken ring on one or more pistons causing
blow by.

It may go another 10,000 or more miles with out a problem
(other than adding oil ;-})

A type IV rebuild could run you $1000 up depending on
how much is needed

It's a risk you have to decide if you want take.

Good luck

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I'm contemplating the purchase of a 1978 Westy. The owner is a friend of
&gt; mine who bought it a few years ago and drove it some 5400 miles in one big
&gt; stint and then parked it. No rust, new paint, new canvas pop top, just had
&gt; it smogged in CA. He's asking $3000 for it.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the snag it has this curious habit of consuming oil. To be clear it
&gt; doesn't SEEM to burn oil (doesn't blow smoke, doesn't even leak when
&gt; parked). It just eats a quart or so every 300-500 miles.
&gt;
&gt; It's had this nasty proclivity since my friend acquired it. As he was
&gt; driving all over the country at the time it made him a bit nervous at
&gt; first. En route he took it to three different mechanics who couldn't really
&gt; figure it out. He says a VW guru in Moab CO told him just to keep putting
&gt; oil in it. Said he'd seen this kind of thing before. Suggested that putting
&gt; in really heavy weight oil might solve the problem. As my friend was on the
&gt; last leg of his tour he never got around to trying this suggestion.
&gt;
&gt; Considering these facts is $3000 a reasonable price? The Bus is really
&gt; clean, runs well, original plaid upholstery. Doesn't have the stove/frig
&gt; package though just sink.
