&lt;&lt;Same problem here and the engine is definitely hotter than that.
Now how did you (or anyone else) manage to fit both the &quot;drain-plug&quot; sender
AND the oil screen? They interfered with each other on my 1600 and my
solution (for now) was to drill a hole in the screen as well.&gt;&gt;

We had no problem with that at all. Ours is a VDO. We did see one in a
catalog
that seemed longer than the one we have. Sorry I couldn't help you more with
this.
