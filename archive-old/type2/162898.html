Subject: Re: [T2] Nitrogen Filled Tires

&gt;A guy here at work was telling me about his tire filling experience the other
&gt;day.  His tires were low.  He was going to fill them but his friend filled
&gt;them with Nitrogen (he had some).

	Nitrogen instead of air in tyres is a bit like 
water-injection  -  the reasons look convincing, and the technique 
catches on for a while (in NZ, late 1970s) but then sinks almost 
without trace.
	The history of technology is not sprinkled with 
irrationalities  -  it's dominated by irrationality.


&gt;  Evidently, nitrogen has larger molecules
&gt;which prevent the air from seeping out of the tire as fast.  Did a Google
&gt;search
&gt;and he was right.  A tire stays inflated 3 times longer.  It states a typical
tire can loose almost 3 pounds of pressure per month (that sounds like a lot

	Air is roughly 4/5 nitrogen.  The rest, for the purposes of 
tyre inflation, is oxygen  -  which has a slightly heavier molecule. 
The difference in performance as a tyre gas is not due to molecular 
weights (on which basis nitrogen would diffuse out thru the rubber at 
a slightly higher rate) but to the (would you believe) oxidative 
properties of oxygen.
	Anyhow, what matters most is not how it works but whether 
nitrogen is a better gas in tyres than air.  I believe the evidence 
is quite favourable to nitrogen
