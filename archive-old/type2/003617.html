Tom,

The symtoms sound exactly like a TO bearing. A buddy of mine had similar
symptoms and pulled his engine twice trying to solve it by focussing on the
throw out bearing.

In his case it was that little roller bearing installed in the flywheel that
supports the engine end of the tranny input shaft.

Make sure you check/replace this bearing next time your engine is out.
