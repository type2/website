We continue to see conflicting data.  Most of the people who
submitted forms for the Old Bus Registry were not very clear on
the meaning of the ID tag.

yup - i see conflicting data all the time,  but usually after figuring it
out, it turns out that it didn't conflict in the first place.  i am still
under the impression that the first line of the tag is the date of
manufacture, though.  ive been looking at the OBR that has the M codes in it,
and the example given is one of the older style.  it does not explain the
middle number of the last line, which is still puzzling me.

I'm advocating a follow-up sheet/decoding service to all Registry
people.  At first I thought a post card mailer might do the
trick, but I'm not sure now.  (BTW, I don't see any Clara in the
Old Bus Registry.)

mea culpa   :(   

One thing I *have* wondered about is how many of those tags have
changed over the years.  Those that I've seen are held in place
by two small screws and easily removable/switchable.  Nah,
wouldn't happen.
