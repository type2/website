&gt; Back in the late '50s splits did come in a two-tone version which included 
&gt; black. The upper half (from the belt line up (including the &quot;v&quot; in the nose) 
&gt; was black and the lower half was a color called &quot;sealing wax red&quot;. It was 
&gt; predominately found on the deluxe 23 window Type 2s.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe that color combination lasted past 1960 or so.

It's not really black.  It's Chestnut Brown.  I think this was the 
standard color combo for Deluxes thru '58 (?).  My '81 Vanagon is black, 
but was painted that way by the former owner (a Menonite farmer).  It 
used to be Yellow/Cream two-tone (a much better color IMHO).

BTW, does anyone know the mixing codes for Sealing Wax Red?  I need some 
touch up paint for the '64 Deluxe.  TIA.
