Volks...
  thanks for all your thoughts! Snoopy, you gave me a great idea man. I'm gonna go with a futon. obviously it's not legal for passengers, but i don't plan on having kids for awhile. so that will work out good. probably make camping a little more comfy too. is there enough room to open the futon?


Peace &amp; Harmony
