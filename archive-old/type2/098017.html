Subject: CA smog exemption (was Re: [T2] Reattaching the panel vinyl)

&gt; 1965
&gt; 
&gt; P &amp; C
&gt; &gt; What was it before the fixed year of 1973?
 
Before that it was a 20 year-old rolling exemption. In 1987 my first car was a 
66 Mustang handed down from my mom. I thought I was set. I would be able to do 
whatever hot rodding I pleased.  The 1965 cutoff came along about a year or so 
later.:-( I never got around to truly hot rodding it but made some mods that 
would have failed the visual test

OBC-Even though my 72 passed the two smog checks I had to do before 73 became 
the magic year, I don't miss the worry and cost. I keep it tuned up for 
minnimum emissions.
