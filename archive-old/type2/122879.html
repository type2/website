Subject: Re: [T2] thread merge: Bus needed in central cal for
  photoshoort/ some questions from a beginner

&gt;-i need a dependable daily driver capable of sustained 70mph speeds - i
&gt;understand there are dual &gt;carb options and special transmisions...where,
&gt;how, what?

Andrew,

Don't know if you noticed the excerpt from the below message but it really
cracks me up!!!  I hope this answers your questions.  Welcome to bus
ownership--finding the T2 list is only the first step to admitting you have
a joyous problem.  A bus will find you shortly, and call on you to save it!

&gt; Re: Bus needed in central cal for photoshoort
(snip)
&gt; Sorry for the late notice as our scheduled bus is not operable as of this
&gt; week end.

why does this sound so familiar? LOL! (flame suit on for the diehard daily
drivers)

Sorry about the B/W volks, I just couldn't resist. Bus content:  I feel like
I am finally getting there after 5 years of bus ownership (cosmetic issues
excepted).  Dual carbs and special transmissions.  Hamsters on steroids!

PS. The real secret is to pay up front for the best possible rust-free OG
bus, list-recommended, known ownership history, and documented maintenance
at least since the last resurrection.  I always make the mistake of taking
on basket cases and never having much to show despite all the parts costs.
Or you could just buy Mike G's Porsche bus from Colorado!
