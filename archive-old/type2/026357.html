Subject: RE: [T2] K&amp;N Air filters. anyone?

	Please allow me to chime in once more on this thread.  Like any
other 'performance' oriented service product, the K&amp;N air filter requires
REGULAR maintenance.  I know it tells you on the box that it will last for
100,00 miles, but then so do the platinum spark plug boxes.  The issue at
hand is the regulart cleaning and (here's the clincher everyone) re-oiling
of the filter!  What a shocker!  The oil used on the pleated gauze is very
light, and as such gets drawn out of the filter over time.  This must be
replaced from time to time.  I have a feeling that in many of the engines
described with premature internal wear, that the issue was one of sealing
not filtration.  K&amp;N makes a sealing grease to correct this  often
overlooked issue.  Just MHO.

	Eron
