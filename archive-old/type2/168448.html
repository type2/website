Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Tell us about YOUR heat

I'd definitely recommend recirculating the air from the cabin. Its
warmer, and it smells better.

I did this &quot;recirculation&quot; modification on a '75 bus I used to have.
The stock was barely working... I ran an intake tube from an intake
vent I cut under the rear seat that fed air directly to the stock
heater fan above the engine. I also blocked off the fan shroud
connectors to the HE's (I was missing the brackets and the flaps, they
were just acting as huge leak points of heat; and less smelly air).I
vaguely remember flipping the fan around so the intake was facing
forward.... I don't remember why... this was 10 years ago or so. The
air then went through the stock heating system, which I sured up at
the time.. My main reasoning was that the heat always smelled like the
engine compartment, gas smell, dirt and exhaust....  This mod fixed
that... and it seemed to make it a little warmer too. It was never
hot... but if left running it would the window clear and prevent
hypothermia during long New England winters :)


The '74 that I've had for 10 years has no heat. Its missing almost
everything (but has REALLY NICE heat exchangers :) . It gets little
winter use and I'm sure to keep lots of blankets in there. One of
these days I'm going to get it working again. I have 3 or 4 heater
fans which I might get creative with.

Does anyone have a pair of those the Heat exchanger to Fan shroud &quot;C&quot;
brackets? I'm also missing one of the two mini flaps, but I can't
remember which one off the top of my head.

My split was once a left-coast bus and has lots less rust than my '74.
The stock heat works exceptionally well in that one.

 We all know gas heaters are
&gt; great, but what about using the existing system?
