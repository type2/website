Subject: RE: [VB] Product Report - Cleaning Bad connections

&gt;The answer for bad connections is with a spray terminal cleaner.  Here's
how
&gt;it works:  first off, you must have tight connections between the male and
&gt;female connectors and the connectors must be attached firmly to the wire or
&gt;you are just wasting your time.  If the connectors are solid and attached
to
&gt;the wire, seporate them and spray just a short burst on each end, put the
&gt;ends together a few times to help brake up the corrosion, then spray one
&gt;last short burst on each and reconnect

Sounds like a good way to go, especially as it is a lubricant as well. A
trick I learnt from riding Motor bikes was to clean the terminals by what
ever means and grease them before re-connecting. I'd occasionally spend
weeks riding in mud and rain with exposed wires and never had electrical
problems. I have continued to do this to any terminal I touch, even
terminals inside my bus!
