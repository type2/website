Subject: one gets away

Weekend before last, a friend invited me to go look at a couple busses by a
relative of his' place.  I declined because I had committed to looking at a
Vanagon (!) for Tom Forhan (sp?)

Well, he went without me, and picked up whats s'posed to be a reasonably
rust-free, straight '61 standard for $200.  Haven't seen it yet, but
everyone else tells me its real nice.  It doesn't run, of course, but for
$200...

On the flip side, his '60 DD panel might be up for sale pretty soon...
