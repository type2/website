Are VW 021 905 205P distributers available and if so where?  I have a '77
2.0 FI with a 009.  It runs good and I had no idea that the dreaded 009 sat
underneith.

I've been investigating an occurence where upon start up I can consistently
kill the engine by pushing the gas.  Could this be related to the 009?

All hoses are in place.  I haven't had the CO mixture set.

To test the aux air valve I tried to blow through it from the intake through
the valve to the air distribution box with the engine fairly cold.  When I
puckered up I could only faintly hear air coming out into the air
distribution box.  It was hard to blow through.  Is this a sign of a bad aux
air valve and if so what effect would it have?

TIA,
Christopher
