Subject: Remember STOMPIN' 76?

Older VW crowd,

Is there anyone in this group who was at a huge music festival held just outside
of Galax, Virginia on August 6,7 &amp; 8, 1976? I know this is a little bit off the
normal Type2 discussions, but since it is a FRIDAY... Stompin' 76 was a more
promoted version of the annual &quot;Old Fiddlers Convention&quot; which still held. We
somehow heard about here in Cincinnati and decided to go there. Our group
of 5 guys traveled there via 3 motorcycles and my trusty 1972 type3 fastback.
(ah the days before rust) One pleasent memory of the drive was hanging my head
out of the type3 at 60 MPH listening to my freinds both on Kal Z-1 900's with
headers as they blasted through the mile long tunnels in Virginia. What a sweet
sound! We drove through the night and sometime before dawn all the roads around 
Galax were like a parking lot. Several hundred thousand people had also heard 
about Stompin' 76. By afternoon we were lead to a farmers field where we camped
the for next few days. The stage area was still about 2 miles from our campsite.
I don't think the promoters had any idea that so many would show up. I don't 
recall seeing many of the acts, but I do remember sitting under an old school 
bus during the rain on Saturday night. I'm sure there were a large group of 60's 
era type2's which brought their owners to the festival.

I know there are some people reading this group who were born before ~1960 that
remember this event. Those of you who weren't around for Stompin' 1976 you sould
have been there! Haven't seen anything like it since.

Old brain cell storage locker closed now.
