Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] using a cyl head temp sensor for oil temp?

&gt;Porsche places the CHT under a cylinder head bolt.
&gt;The VDO spark plug ring can be used under a bolt head as well.
&gt;If you wanted to find the hottest or coldest point on the head I wouldn't
&gt;know where to tell you to look.

Infrared non-contact temp gun. $10 if you are lucky and find a nice Raytek 
at the local garage sale (like me) or $30 at radio Shack I've heard.

Run it, shoot it to find the hottest point NOT under the spark plug.

I have not done this test but have used a head bolt versus the sparkplug - 
just know that you've got an approximation of the head temps versus proof. 
Easy to spot trends. Numbers are not important. Of Stan said this too.
