Subject: RE: Yakima bike rack on roof of 70 Westfalia?
Mime-Version: 1.0

&gt;Has anyone had success w/ installation of a Yakima bike rack on the roof of a
bay window Westfalia camper?

Funny you should ask, I've been researching this for a couple of years (and
waiting till I finish my restoration before I go ahead an actually do it).

Two of the Yakima engineers (whose names are written down on a paper I dont have
with me) were suggesting that I come up to Eureka and have them take a close
look at the rear luggage rack. The idea being that they can custom build a tower
that runs under the space in the fiberglass, run the cross bars also under the
fiberglass, cut small sections that will house the bike rack locks, and not
raise the height of the bus. This would solve several problems:
     The rack would attach to the rain gutter for strength.
     The poptop would still be usable.
     The height wouldn't change (very important when 1 more inch on height would
keep me from fitting in half the garages in San Francisco.
     The aesthetics would not be severly altered.
     I would not have to remove anything between trips, other than the bikes.

I was planning on making the run and subsequent two day stay while they fiddle
around with my bus later this year. If it works out, I'll post pictures.
