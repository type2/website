Subject: timing?

Hello,
	I have set the timing on my engine to 7o BTDC and its
seems to have a hard time starting and has mini backfires
just when warming up. So I am thinking that the timing is just
a bit to advanced which causes the hard starting and backfires.

I have a 79 engine with a weber progressive carb, Stock dizzy 1 Vac.

After reading muirs book and the library most say that the timing
is either going to be set to 7.5o BTDC or 5o ATDC depending on the
engine setup so on. From what I read it seems the two timing settings
I mentioned above were -ALL-?? that I should set it too and nothing
in between.

What I am wanting to know is would it be ok to retard it to
say 5o BTDC to see if it helps? And if it does leave it.
The PO had it set at 6 ATDC and it ran badly.

I dont know if this has to do with the timing or not but if I give
it some gas and then let of it makes a sortive tickly tick noise.
I have hydraulic lifters could they need replacing? Oil pressure
not building up in them and causing this I am thinking.
Or is it something else?

PS. passed emissions finaly, and I am pretty happy and so is the bus :)

Alex,
