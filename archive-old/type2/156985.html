Subject: Re: [T2] No pulse at injector in '77 EFI

Hello,

I had a similiar problem with my old bus. Everything
was in place and I tested every part and found them to
be working properly. I had no vacuum leaks....

It turned out to be something very simple. The signal
wire had come loose from the coil. I reconnected it
and my bus fired up and stayed running on the first
try. Check that connection on the coil. It is the
easiest thing to check.

That was my $0.015 cents worth.

&gt;  I've isolated that the injectors are not being
&gt; grounded (pulsed) by the
&gt;  ECU and so replaced both the ECU and the matching
&gt; AFM from my running '76 Westy. But alas, again, only
&gt; a
&gt; momentary start but then doesn't run and no
&gt; triggering (grounding) of the injectors.
