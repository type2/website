Subject: oil temp sendor Q

Hi,

I unpacked my parts delivery today and inspected the new sump plate ( 
for 1600) oil temp sender and sump screen. I am a bit concerned that 
all this is not going to go together well.

Install should go a little like this. Drill a  9/16&quot; hole in the sump 
plate. Put the sender through and use the flat nut to secure it to 
the plate. The business end of the sender will need to be placed 
carefully so it will not hit the bottom of the sump screen which is 
actually solid. I have not gotten the drill out yet but it appears 
that the size of the nut which is as small as it can be will force 
the sender towards the center of the sump plate thusly interfering 
with the solid base of the sump screen. The business end of the 
sender seems to be solid metal. Can it be ground down to fit without 
affecting the accuracy of the sender?

Thanks
