Subject: BN4 noise on the radio
Message-ID: &lt;007101be9af4$8197f5b0$a7fd60cf_at_lperron_3.STAS-UNIGEC.COM&gt;
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

How can I isolate the bn4 circuit from the radio circuit.  I ear the
constant frying noise of the spark plug comming out the the radio while the
heater is operating.  For now, both the main power and the switch power are
connected on the batery all the time ( circuit number 30) and each one as a
fuse on it.

My engine as 4 sparkplugs and My radio is very good.  I dont see any special
device between the coil and the buse box!

any suggestions?
