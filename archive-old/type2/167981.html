Subject: Re: [T2] Sending Unit O-Ring needed?

In addition to the dealer, Bus Depot, etc., having this O-Ring, Airhead/VWG
has been making 'em for the past several years:

http://www.airheadparts_dot_com/viewDetail.asp?strMasterCat=&amp;idproduct=5682

Amazingly enough, VWG sells several hundred of these a year into Europe (of
all places) to various vendors.  In addition to late Bays, they also fit
Super Beetles, Rabbits, Jettas, Sciroccos, Vanagons, etc.  I always have a
bag of 'em in my display case when I take it to a show.

&gt; Hello lists, I just got my 75 Riviera running and
&gt; driving, for the first time in atleast 9 years.
&gt; My problam now is I have a fuel leak coming from the
&gt; Sending unit o-ring. So where do I find one? What size
&gt; is it?
&gt; I always see posts about replaceing your fuel lines,
&gt; which I did, but I have never seen anyone say to
&gt; replace or check the O-Ring.
&gt; So if it has been said before then I missed that post,
&gt; but if it hasn't been said. I am now!
&gt; Check those fuel tank sending unit o-rings also when
&gt; you are checking and replacing the fuel lines.
&gt; Thanks, and hope everyone is enjoying the long
&gt; weekend.
