Subject: Re: [T2] Hi Listers I'm Back!!! need engine info...

&gt; Hay List,
&gt;
&gt; is there a differance between a &quot;1600cc Bug engine&quot; and a &quot;1600cc Bus engine&quot;????
&gt;
&gt; If I have a &quot;1600cc Bug engine&quot; what would I have do to put it in 1970 bus??

a bus engine has bosses and tapped holes in the rear to mount the engine
to the hanger. universal cases have them so the &quot;bug&quot; engine may or may
not.
there is a adaptor available.
