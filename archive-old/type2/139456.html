Subject: Re: [T2] Rebuild fun

You may be right, but if you are, then Wilson is wrong:

&quot;You want a minimum of 0.020 in. (0.51mm)
with up to 0.050 in. (1.27mm) acceptable.
What you don't want is less than 0.020 in.

&quot;Adjust the clearance by changing shims.
You can install any number of shims of differ-
ent thicknesses to get the desired clearance as
long as you have at least two shims in Type
13 engines and one in Type 4s. Shims are
available at the dealer and VW parts houses.&quot;
