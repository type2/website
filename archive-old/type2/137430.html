Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Carb Recomendations

Hi Eric,

Ummm... Fuel injection?  Mine was a bit awkward to get running (It took 
about 3 weeks of tweaking) but ever since it lit up it has been a lot 
easier to live with than my dual carbs ever were. You need a good 
voltmeter, compression gauge, vacuum gauge and timing light if you're 
going to troubleshoot FI. It also helps to have the tech manuals, and 
to get familiar with the excellent resources at www.ratwell_dot_com.

My Dad has dual weber 34's on his Vanagon work truck, and they run 
GREAT from May-October. From November to April it's pretty cold-blooded 
since the webers have no chokes, but it works fine once it warms up. We 
eventually want to convert it to FI, but Dad doesn't want to take it 
off the road until I have time to make SURE that we can do the swap in 
a single weekend: he needs that vehicle for his business.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
