Subject: Nose welding/wrecked singlecab

Hello,
Yesterday I wrecked my 68 single cab.
It is fixable but i will have to cut the whole front
off, a-pillars and forward.
I have a clip from another bus to put on there and my
question is what would be the best way to mate it in
the windshield area? 
Thanks 
Bryan
