Hello everyone,

My name is Erik Weber and I just bought my first VW bus (1972) She is in
great shape, except for the interior. In the past I've owned a couple of
69 beetles so the transformation isn't to shocking.

I do have a couple of questions and would love it if someone could point
me in the right direction.

I need a source for the following

Window cranks
Steering Wheel

Much nmore to follow, but this is were i'm starting.

Thanks,

Looking forward to being part of this list.

Erik Weber
