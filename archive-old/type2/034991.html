Subject: ISO Turn Signal Switch

Howdy folks,

I am in desperate need of a turn signal switch for my 74 westy.  It is
the ONLY THING that is preventing me from driving my new bus, (I want to
be as legal as possible before I head out into the real world.)

Ideally, I would like to buy a new one, but my local vw dealer said that
Volkswagen &quot;no longer manufactures them.&quot;  If anyone knows an
aftermarket source, I would greatly appreciate it.

But I would never turn down any kindness, and if anyone has a spare
lying around, I would greatly appreciate the hook-up.  Email off-list
about it.

Thanks much

Jack
