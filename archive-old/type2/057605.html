Subject: TYPE IV into a 68-71 bus ? (anyone ever done this)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I would like to exchange e-mail with anyone who has sucessfully installed (or
knows how to install) a TYPE IV motor WITH ALL STOCK SHEETMETAL from the TYPE
IV into a van (westfalia) of the 68 - 71 generation. (this is what I want to
do)

Please I do not want to hear about the kits for building an upright / 911 /
Generations / homemade kit for converting a TYPE IV. I plan on using all of
the stock sheet metal off of the original 2.0 litre TYPE IV configuration. If
I have to I will alter the body of the 1971 I am installing it into. I would
rather do that than to convert the sheet metal on the engine. (You see, if
need be, I am going to swap this engine between a couple different vehicles)
Another bus... and two 914's. I want an easy swap between vehicles.

Thanks
