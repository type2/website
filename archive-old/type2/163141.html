Mike, All,

Recently bought a 'bus' ignition housing from auction site since my ignition
switch was failing mechanically and electrically.  Figured I'd just swap out
the whole assembly, make my life easier.

New 'bus' housing shows up.  Pulled mine, compare....  Not the same.
Must've got a bug one.

Okay, just swap out the lock tumbler, well, they're tamper proof.  There is
a process, but it's rough gang.

Had it swapped and running by 2am that night though.

Billy
M'boro, TN
