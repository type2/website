Yea, right. VW spent MILLIONS of dollars on R&amp;D, and you're trying to tell us 
that the MILLION or so Type2's that were produced with hyd. lifters were 
intentionally intended to die a fiery death after an unnaturally short 
service life due to the stock cam causing an overheat condition?!!!!! No 
offense, but I, for one, trust VW's R&amp;D Engineers more than ANY aftermarket 
builder/vendor.
