http://www.AVWA_dot_com has various types of volkswagens for sale.  However,
some of the ads seem to be outdated.  This club puts on a good show in
Sevierville twice a year.  Several buses.

Subject: bus for sale sites in the Internet


&gt; It has been a week now since the serious hunt for a replacement for the
&gt; wrecked '69 began. I have been trolling the internet looking for a split
&gt; screen passenger bus that I can afford, is in acceptable condition and is
&gt; within 500 miles of me. I have come across a few sites where there are
lots
&gt; of buses but I am wondering if I am overlooking other ones. So far  I am
&gt; trolling:
&gt;
&gt; http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/classifieds_main.htm and Everett
has
&gt; put together a really great site BTW:)
&gt; http://home.graphics.uwaterloo_dot_ca/vwbuysell/ a type_dot_com joint(hmm will
that
&gt; get filtered?)

&gt; ~Search
&gt; http://ep_dot_com/ep/sub.html?cat=1158000 this one has a nice layout
&gt; various local and regional newspapers but I will spare you the details
&gt;
&gt; Would anyone like to add to this list?
