&gt; Thanks to everyone for the info on the cost of the job.  I'm picking
it up
&gt; tommorrow and here is a rough breakdown of the costs:
&gt; 
&gt; 3 cv joints _at_ $50 = $150
&gt; 4 boots _at_ $12 = $48
&gt; overnight shipping (twice)  = approx. $25
&gt; 8 hrs labor _at_ $20 = $160
&gt; 
&gt; TOTAL = $383
&gt; 
&gt; Thank goodness I live where labor is cheap!!

Yeah, considering that this job shouldn't take anywhere near 8 hours. 
Even at my lethargic pace it only takes me a couple of hours to do one
axle and that includes cleaning the joints, which wouldn't be done if
they are being replaced.  I'd figure that a pro, with the proper tools
(lift, air ratchet, hydraulic press) should be able to do an axle in
about an hour, perhaps a half-hour more if he had to clean up the area
before starting disassembly.  Both axles should be done in less than
three hours.

You should put a new (or good-used) CV and a pair of boot kits in your
parts box in case one goes when travelling.  They can be a bit hard to
find on the road!
