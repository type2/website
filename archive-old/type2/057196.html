Subject: 1977 Type manual and Westfalia manual....

Hi all,
I have the original type 2 manual, as well as the original westfalia
camper manual in very good condition. I am also a website developer so I
have the equipment to scan these in and create a web site. The time to
do it is another story altogether, but I would like to do something to
give back to the list for all the help, support and kind email I ahve
received from so many of you. Since my VW technical skills are in the
early development stage, I have little to offer in that area, but if any
of you think it would be of value to create a web site with this info on
it please let me know and I will get started this weekend, so I could
expect to have it up just before the power grid fails on Jan 1 2000 :)
:) In all seriousness It should only take a couple of nights of scanning
and then writing the pages.
Thanks for all your help, support and kind thoughts,
peace scoob
