I'll have to take a picture. The condensation tubes in the breather lines are perhaps made of someting besides copper?

Up in the intake area there are a lot of metal folds and such and rust likes to collect in there. Would it be a good idea to cut the vents out, prep the area and weld them back in?

&gt;VW also put  a lot of caulk around the engine compartment

I noticed that and left all of it alone the last time I went in there with a paintbrush. What is it exactly and where can I locate more? I understand why it's there, I just can't identify it.
