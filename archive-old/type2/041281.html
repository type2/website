Subject: Re: cooling system for 78 Westy

Thanks for more support.  I really didn't expect all this feedback, but it's 
all been very helpful.  Now I can confidently stand by my arguement.  Another 
funny thing about my SO, he fed way too much oil to Consuela, about a year 
ago and blew several seals, which I've replaced.  I swore I'd never let 
another man touch her.....nothing personal.

Thanks again to everyone.
