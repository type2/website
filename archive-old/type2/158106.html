Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

Hi Terry,

One of the Canadian motorcycle magazines reviewed the modern Royal  
Enfield a few years back. They were APALLED at the lack of quality  
that the Indian factory allowed through QA.

Apparently the local importer has to import 3 bikes for every 2 he  
intends to sell as roadworthy, and he also has to personally train  
his customers on the rigorous maintenance required to keep them on  
the road.

These things make an old VW look like a modern BMW in comparison.


Happy trails,

&gt;
&gt; Still??
&gt;
&gt; They never got the high sign went Indian / Enfield went Kaput to stop
&gt; production.
&gt;
&gt; They must have missed the smoke signals that it was all over.
&gt;
&gt; Like the Ural the Enfield isn't a bad bike, its just stuck in a 50  
&gt; year
&gt; time warp---
&gt; They both make you appreciate the current technology &amp; advancements in
&gt; motoring about on two wheels.
&gt;
&gt; It's very similar to owning and driving any older VW.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;The vehicle's that time forgot&quot;
