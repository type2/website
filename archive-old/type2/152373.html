Subject: RE: Strap holder behind passenger seat

&gt;That sounds pretty original as emergency triangle and first aid kit are
&gt;required in every vehicle in Germany.


forgot, my bus was bought over there by P.O.  Pity the strap is 
broken. A bungee cord just isnt as smart.  Dont have the first aid 
kit though. well, of course I have one, just not OEM.
