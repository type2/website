Whoa! Slow down, Keemosabe! Don't shoot! I wasn't trying to badmouth 
Muir...I think it's a great book. I understand that maybe we have a few 
better ideas/solutions than were available back then. What I was after was 
the current view on carbs, timing, and warming up. Only one person seemed to 
pick up on this....guess I need to work on my sense of humor.  =^)

And what is good, Phaedrus,
And what is not good---
Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?

&gt;
&gt;And NO not the Star Trek Dr. Spock.... the one that wrote the famous 
&gt;medical
&gt;book that was a staple for it's time... yes he was later disproved and 
&gt;wrong
&gt;on many things, but he had good information for the time... same with Muir.
&gt;
&gt;Also look at it this way... can YOU do better ?

&gt;walk in his moccasins !
