Subject: Re: [T2] Supplemental blower in 79' Westy not working

Jared, the relay on the fan may have gone bad.  Also, is your alternator 
working?.  The fan won't work unless the alternator is charging while the 
motor is running.  If it's not the relay, it may be the little grounding 
switch under the dash when you pull the right hand red lever down.  By 
pulling that lever down, it completes a grounding connection which makes it 
all work.  good luck, greg
