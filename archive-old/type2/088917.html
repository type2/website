Subject: Evaporative/Charcoal cannister

In a recent post Doyt Echelberger in Ohio   USA wrote:
&gt;my type 4 engine in my 76 Westy USA model uses engine
&gt;vacuum to draw gasoline fumes out of the gas tank and through the charcoal
&gt;canister.
I checked the connections in two of the VW manuals I have. It appears
earlier bays (pre '73 I think) had two breather lines (left and right) from
the top of the tank running up high in the back of the bus, then back down
into the engine bay and directly to air cleaner after the filter. (this is
how my '77 is currently hooked up, as well as two 'parts' buses I have, '71
and '74). In later models the Evaporative/Charcoal canister was added. From
what I can tell there are three connections on the canister. In the VW
manuals they appear connected with one hose from the cooling fan
(pressurised air), one to the air cleaner, after the filter (slight vacuum
from carb/inlet), and one to the tank breather lines, which previously went
directly to the air cleaner.
Am I reading this correctly??
If not, is it dangerous to have my breather connected the way they are as
Doyt mentioned??
As I have no pressurised air tapping in my fan housing (type 4 motor) it
will be difficult to install a canister, unless someone has a better idea
them me. Any thought's???
