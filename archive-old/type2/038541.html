* 1972 Volkswagen Type 2 Kombi / Contempo Conversion Camper Van with
High Top Fiberglass Roof. *

In Dec 1999, the 1700cc engine was replaced with a bigger 1976 - 2000cc
engine , which was rebuilt,
purchased from and installed by an air cooled VW shop in San Francisco.
The clutch was replaced with
the bigger size and a new electric fuel pump was installed then.

The original dual Solex carbs were replaced in Jan 2000 with a new
single 2bbl carb.
The dual Solex's and all hardware are included with van.

It has a new rug, new plywood floor and a new roof vent.  The replacing
of interior roof paneling and insulation is started.
The rear seat, closet and rear storage above bed is from a 1976 camper.
Replacing of front and rear overhead storage bays is started.

The tan brown VW front seats are near new and the blue captain's chairs
seats are out of a Chevy van conversion.
Buyer gets both sets of seats.

The stove, refrigerator, sink and propane furnace is all there but
disconnected from the work in progress. Buyer will have to finish. I
preferred having the extra room and weight savings from leaving them
out. The propane tank works ok and has LPG in it.

Has two batteries.

Tires and everything else is in good condition that I know of.

Previous owners have done alot of work on it before me including a new
windshield.
Shafts and transmission look new/replaced.

This vehicle has been very reliable.  It's fast, strong and pulls hills
easily.
The rear bumper has a tow hitch.   I've towed small cars with no
problems.

There are very few high tops in nice condition around.

Also included is the ORIGINAL shipping document written in German.

This vehicle is SMOG exempt (pre-1973).

Hemmings Motor News price guide lists the 1972 VW van in good condition
at $4825 and $7200 in excellent condition.


Asking $3500 obo.
