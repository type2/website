&gt;Has anybody done this before, and can give me some hints as to how it's 
&gt;done?

I use the Betty Crocker method.  Clean the crank gear that drives the cam 
and the distributer gear.  Bake in toaster oven at 450d for 5 minutes.  
Remove from toaster oven with channel locks &amp; they slide right onto the 
crankshaft.  Garnish and serve.  Feeds one.
