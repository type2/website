To align the steering wheel to level, pop the drag link back out, level
the wheel, and adjust the length of the drag link til it drops into the
pitman arm.  Assuming you have correctly installed the pitman arm on the
steering box, the box will be centered when the wheels are pointing
straight ahead.  It is very important that the box be centered when the
wheels are pointed ahead!

The full front end drill on a 'loaf, from scratch, is to point the
driver's side wheel to 1/2 the correct toe, adjust the passenger's side
with the adjustable tie rod, 'til it has the other half of the correct
toe, then pop the drag link out and center the steering box.  Adjust the
length of the drag link so it drops into the pitman arm.  *Then* and only
then can you pop the steering wheel off to level it.

Given that you have replaced the steering box, I would say that if your
wheel was level before you started, then it should be level now (unless
you put the pitman arm on one spline off :) Assuming that the arm *is* one
spline off, there is plenty of adjustment room in the drag link to take
care of this, and you can pop the wheel and re-center it, but .... as
George said, again you need a special pulller (for the early bus, late bus
the wheel just slides off).  Do *not* try hammering the wheel off...
you'll just break up the plastic surround and have an *UGLY* wheel!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
