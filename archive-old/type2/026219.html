Subject: RE: Cargo Floor Questions.......

[...] Passenger Busses didn't have a masonite floor.  They should have a
rubber mat like the front.  In 1970 brown mats were standard with at least
one color combination.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a few questions about the cargo floor (you know, just behind the
&gt; rear 
&gt; seat, made out of masonite and covered with a dense fabric) for my 7 
&gt; passenger 1970 Bus.
