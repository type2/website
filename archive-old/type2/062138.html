Subject: re: Canvas for single cab

'Sorry I don't have a source for the canvas.  However, last May I 
attended WCM's &quot;yard sale&quot; and found four new straps for a buck! It is 
possible that Loren either has the canvas or can have it made. 

Question: Were the &quot;covered wagon&quot; canopies (sp?) a VW factory option, 
dealer option, VW of America option or aftermarket item?  

I have a rather tattered but servicable one on my &quot;60 single cab.  It 
is black, either rubberized or vinyl impregnated and appears to have 
withstood many years of mis-use and abuse.
