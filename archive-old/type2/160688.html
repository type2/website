Subject: Re: [T2] the hubcap

Here is a picture of Sear Bartnik (the young, good looking guy) with Barry
Burneskis (the 'other' young, good looking guy - with glasses) passing off
the Touring Hubcap about May 2000. It was pretty clean then, just a few
signatures..  The box (thank you, Mike Benthin) was pretty much empty.

There were other pictures and diaries on the Type2 before it underwent a
purge.

BTW, even with my license plate and rear window (and other artifacts), I
still have never been profiled or stopped.  There have been a few instances
where  a road warrior asked for a 'cold one'!
