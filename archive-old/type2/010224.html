&gt;So, even if it needs an entire engine, it's a bargain.

Probably so, depending on a number of variables. The following advice is 
in the &quot;if you have to ask ...&quot; category. Find a good VW mechanic with 
Type IV experience to go over the bus, including the engine, completely. 
You want two things from him or her: (1) a guess at the condition of the 
engine (which could be a good guess) and (2) a list of items that will 
need replacement or that vary from stock.

For starters, your problem is certainly not a head gasket, so avoid that 
&quot;expert&quot; like your life depended on it.

The reason for pursuing (2) above is that someone who will run a bus 
engine without adequate oil may well be the kind of person who will 
remove bits of cooling tin, seals, and flaps; remove a good fuel 
injection system and replace it with carbs that have never been properly 
tuned, and a host of other horrors.

If much of this is the case at all, you are much better off buying a 
rusty but mechanically sound bus for $1000-1500 and doing a swap than 
trying to fix and replace parts in the bus piecemeal. The price of the 
latter can easily top $5000. Ask me how I know.

You will also want to buy copies of:

John Muir: How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive

and

Robert Bentley: Official Service Manual, Station Wagon/Bus 1968-79

Eventually you may also want to get:

Tom Wilson: How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine.


All of these are available from www.busdepot_dot_com, amazon_dot_com, or you 
friendly local bookstore (FLaB).

I would shell out $25 for the body and interior you describe any day; you 
have the beginnings of a fine and unique bus/camper. But you also have a 
long row to hoe before it's reliable.
