&gt; I spent my entire evening last night replacing the fuel tank sending unit.
&gt; It sucked.  Really.  I read the tech article in the library where it sounds

snipped horror story

&gt; So if you read all this you must be as bored at work as I am or you are
&gt; pondering your own fuel tank sender replacement.  My advice to you
&gt; is...don't!  Either cut the hole or pay some other schmo to do it.  I have
&gt; to confess though that I do have some perverse sense of satisfaction
&gt; knowing that I completed the task.  Either that or it's all the gas fumes I
&gt; inhaled.

???? what year bus is this

from the sounds of it, you have a bay with type 4 engine fuel injected??


what library did you check??? the type 2 library?

I know about those screws on the underside of the fuel tank fire wall, but
the rest of the job really isn't that hard...the sender will fit in
without removeing the engine or fuel tank...

.  take off air cleaner
.  remove rear panel covering gas tank
.  lay on rear deck over engine compartment
.  reach in and pull the wires off
.  unscrew the sender
.  wiggle, jiggle and twist it off to one side, it will come
.  put O ring on new sender.
.  drop O ring into tank.
     repeat
.  finally get sender back in tank.
.  replace wires, usually wrong first time (check at this point)
.  switch wires to right terminals
.  put firewall back in,
.  put air cleaner back on

total time with beer break about 2 hours, faster if you've done it once or
twice before.

my 78 is on it's 4th sender and I have never taken the fuel tank out, and
only once did I have the engine out (for other reasons)

should have picked the collective wisdom of this group first.

they have saved me many hours of trial and error
