Subject: No marks / notches on crankshaft pulley

Hi all,

So I am in the middle of replacing my points and adjusting my timing with a
static timing light. Things are going cool until I notice I have no markings
on my crankshaft pully to indicate TDC. Terrific. Any advice on how to
determine TDC so I can get the timing adjusted?
71 bus (with a yucky aftermarket crankshaft pulley with no markings or
notches on it. )

Thanks

( I also posted this on shoptalkforums, so sorry if this is a repeat for
anybody).
