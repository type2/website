Subject: Re: [T2] Antenna replacement

From: &quot;Jon DeVos&quot; &lt;hippygarden_at_comcast_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Our 1978 bus has a broken antenna...

G had an antenna that had been broken off at the solid stud that the hollow
antenna shaft is pressed onto.  Wanting to save a bit of time and money
until I could find the correct replacement part, I took one of those double
antennas that snap into a bracket on a TV set and:

1. Removed one of the antenna shafts near it's base by using a Dremel with a
cutting disk.
2. Took a piece of brass tubing that just fit down over the stud on the bus'
antenna base, and cut out a 1&quot; long, 2/3 section of the tubing (looking down
at the end of the piece, it would look like a letter &quot;C&quot; with a large gap
between the ends of the &quot;C&quot;).
3. Slid the antenna down over the stud, with the piece of tubing
pre-positioned on the stud so that the antenna shaft traps the tubing
between the antenna and the stud.

It was a tight fit, and it's been working for several weeks now.  And should
it break off, I've always got the other antenna shaft.

Oh, and file all exposed cut edges smooth, and WD40 the antenna sections to
lube and protect them (somewhat) from corrosion.
