Subject: Re: [T2] Battery/Starting Anomaly 

Travis-
Try these ideas to isolate this problem:
First, try the new battery in another vehicle.
If this looks good, next reinstall and use only the ground side of your
jumper cables from the new battery to another good chassis ground location.
If this improves, the original ground needs another look.
You can make similar diagnosis with the hot cable alone.
I would take a good look at the cable ends and the battery post connections
to make sure they are brite and tite. The jumper cables are inputting
current
on the outside of those connections.

Subject: [T2] Battery/Starting Anomaly


&gt;Why would a brand new battery
&gt; not be able to start the engine while at the same time, my
&gt; less-than-full-power back-up battery IS able (via jumper cables
&gt; connected to the new battery) to get it started?
