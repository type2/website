That decision would be easy for me.  A couple of days ago I searched my bus thoroughly for something else and found no fewer than FOUR rolls of duct tape.  Left on too many trips where I threw a roll in because I wasn't sure if I already had some on board, and you never know when the highroof will fly off and have to be taped back on.
