&gt; Scott,

&gt; Where were you planning to get your other parts
&gt; (condenser, evaporator, fans, etc..).  I assume you're
&gt; going with r134, were you going to have barrier hoses
&gt; built?

Robert,
I pulled all the guts out of a '72 loaf and will use those as a starting point.
the evaporator comes in a unit that mounts inside the cab up in the roof area
right behind the drivers seat.  That way it blows both towards the front and
rear.
the condenser will mount between the frame rails under the truck and be updated
with modern cooling fans.
Was planning on going r134, and don't yet know about the hose place.  I'm
scouting around for a place to make some hoses for my Jag and will most likely
go back to them for the ac hoses as long as I'm happy with the first set.

Scott
