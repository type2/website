Subject: Re: [T2] My Electrical issues part deux

&gt; This bus is a rich man's project.

Yes, it is. But it's stable when I'm not breaking something. LoL!

My shoulder is a new thing. Dr. is an idiot and won't really look at
it. He just said, &quot;You've got calcium deposits. Here's a prescription
for napercin.&quot; But that obviously isn't the issue when I hurt it
reaching into the engine compartment. I think I tore something.
Because after working on the bus, I stumbled in the house and curled
up in a ball on my bed and popped vicodin until I fell asleep.

I have $20 to my name because my wife is disabled. So I live paycheck
to paycheck... And I get paid every 2 weeks... Next payday is this
coming Friday. ;-)

I don't think getting a different bus is an option because I can't
come up with the $$ all at once to buy one. Even if I sold mine, it's
only worth like $500. Not enough to buy an improvement over what I
already have.
