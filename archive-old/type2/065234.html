&gt;
&gt;There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. If you
receive
&gt;an email message with the subject line &quot;Good Times&quot;, DO NOT read the message,
&gt;DELETE it immediately. Please read the messages below.

(* sigh *) another newbie...

This is so common, it oughta go in the list FAQ or something.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE GOOD TIMES VIRUS!  ITS A STUPID PRANK!

If you ever get some email that instructs you to pass it along to as many
people as you can, its automatically a hoax or a chain letter.  Why would
everyone want to see a hoax or a chain letter?  They don't!

The only virus part of the &quot;Good Times&quot; virus is the fact that unthinking
users keep replicating this silly post!  As we get more and more users on
the net, they keep stumbling upon this virus warning, then passing it onto
other AOL barnies, and the cycle begins anew.
