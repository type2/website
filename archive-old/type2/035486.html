I have new con rod nuts but there does not appear to be any way to

just torqued and wont loosen or is their a trick? 

Per Wilson (I know this applies to the upright engine)
the rod connecting nuts have a thin washer attached to them.  This
washer is peened using a chisel to form a barb that should provide some
additional grab.   I'm going out to the shop.  If the type 4 is
different I'll let you know.
