Subject: Re: [T2] Emergency brake level to brake shoe fastener

&gt; So I'm in the process of changing my rear brake shoes and the lever that goes
&gt; from the brake shoe to the cable appears to be fastened to the shoe with some
&gt; sort of rivet.  This can't be right - I suspect these are the original shoes
&gt; to my bus.  On my 60 the lever is attached to the shoe via this little pin
&gt; that has a clip on the other side.  The Bentley shoes this on the 70's buses
&gt; as well.  What's the story on these rivet type things?  Is there a way to get
&gt; them out short of grinding off one side?  I'm doing the rear brakes on a 78.

The pin and clip was the original fixing but many rebuilders use a rivet
and some use a nut and bolt.  I have had no problem with any as long as
the nut is a nylock or otherwise antivibration.  If it is a plain nut I
replace it with a nylock.

                             OOK!
