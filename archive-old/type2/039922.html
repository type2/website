hey volks,
i agree, it would be cool to meet up at some shows
this summer.   maybe a cool list t-shirt could be made
up, i know i'd pay for one or help get the ball rollin
with any help i can give.   maybe poor richard could
get a design started, he seems to be the talented
t-shirt guy! (hey i dont mean to put him on the spot
or anything, he just makes nice t-shirts)  let me know
by pmail if anything gets going so i can be of some
help.   ....then again sometimes at shows i get so hot
i dont wear a shirt, so maybe a list tattoo is in
order:)(sorry i know its not friday)

&gt; The AIRS t-shirt is how I found George Lyle at
&gt; Havasu. He was wearing
&gt; one, so I figured he was one of ours -- &quot;I'm Nikki,
&gt; who the hell are
&gt; you?&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think a big laminated button, something like 2.5&quot;d
&gt; with the AIRS bus
&gt; on it would be really cool, and it could serve as
&gt; decoration in the off-season.
&gt; 
&gt; I know we're getting into Friday territory here, but
&gt; that's my .02 worth.

&gt; &gt; some of you while staring you straight in the eye!
&gt; Maybe we could just do
&gt; &gt; some kind of highly recognizable logo (like the
&gt; line drawing of the bus on
&gt; &gt; the Type 2 web site) and use that instead of
&gt; plastering our names to our
&gt; &gt; chests...sort of like a brotherhood/sisterhood
