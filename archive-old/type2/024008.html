BTDT, In the late 80's the Japanese shipped motorcycles with gas in the tank. 
By the time we got to sell them gas had gone bad and would jam up the needle 
valves. Qwikkie way to get them to run was a full throttle run. Had one puke 
gas into the airbox on me once and of course the drain for the airbox was 
right in front of the rear tire. 300' semi sideways followed by improptu 
parking in intersection. Bus content, gas,rubber and ashphalt dont mix
