David and David,

Schwartze makes a good point that if the oil temp is lower it could be
because the oil is absorbing less heat, due to a lower rate of heat
absorbtion ( I can't think of the correct term here).  However, if the oil
has the ability to absorb heat quickly it also has the ability to dump
heat quickly, therefore showing a lower temp than an oil with a lower
absorbtion/dump rate.  Remember, the heat is lost throught the bottom of
the oil pan and the oil cooler, and an oil that moves heat better would in
fact operate at a lower temp, and the engine would also run cooler as
well.

Just my opinion, I could be wrong here,
Craig
