Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Regulator - Engine Not Starting

Tim,

I'm going to assume you have the Weber 2 barrel progressive carb setup.  If
that's the case, you should lose the regulator, that was left over from the
FI system and is inappropriate for the carb setup.  Of course the carb may
be problematic but I would be surprised to learn that the carb was so bad
off the vehicle wouldn't run.  More typically it won't hold an idle nicely
when the jets start to get worn and/or contaminated.

Subject: [T2] Fuel Regulator - Engine Not Starting


&gt; Hello,
&gt;        I don't know too much about engines, and I
&gt; don't have the largest fund to put into getting this
&gt; fixed, so I thought I'd do it myself to learn and save
&gt; some money if I could.  Well, my engine won't start
&gt; and when it will, it stays running for about 5
&gt; seconds.  I replaced the fuel filter because I thought
&gt; the gas was not getting to the carb.  It's a 77 westy
&gt; that was converted to carb.  After the gas goes
&gt; through the filter, it goes to the fuel pressure
&gt; regulator.  What it that?  Could that be clogged or
&gt; something?  Or, could it be the carb itself?  Thanks a
&gt; lot.  I appreciate all the help that has been given to
&gt; me to save some money and learn about fixing the bus,
&gt; so I can keep it.
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Tim
