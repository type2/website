Subject: Re: [T2] tapping noise in newly rebuilt engine

&gt;Hi,
&gt;  I just wanted to get some thoughts about a loud tapping noise in our newly
&gt;rebuilt engine.( This is not a Gex,but for now I will not mention the
&gt;builder)  It starts making this noise only after the engine is warmed up. It
&gt;is a 78 hydraulic valved bus,but I don't think it is the valves because it
&gt;does not make this noise at startup. For the same reason I don't suspect an
&gt;exhaust leak. Yes,I checked the archives but didn't see anything just like
&gt;this. I just hope it is not anything deep inside. Even if the warranty thing
&gt;works out,I would not want to redo the installation. Please help.
&gt;

If it's not a valve issue, and it may not be, then it could be a rod
bearing, which if it is will get worse soon. You should first discuss this
with the rebuilder. If he's a good one, he'll have the experience to help
you sort it out. Any skilled mechanic with a stethoscope could offer an
opinion. At least he would have a much better chance at accurate diagnosis
than anyone listening via e-mail.

Even a good warrenty is a redo from time to time. That's why it's better to
pay two times the money for a righeously remanufactured assembly that will
last three times as long as a middlin' priced assembly line rebuilt
wanabee. You reduce the risk of a redo very near nothing at all. That's far
better than any warrenty could hope to be.
