Subject: Re:Can I block EGR ('77)

&gt; Bottom line questions: Can I just plug the line coming up to the FI 
&gt; system from my EGR filter? 

Sure. Many folks do. Or simply do not connect the little lever arm from 
throttle to the EGR valve and it'll always stay closed. Most systems gunk 
up and are functionally closed  after a while anyways.

&gt; Should I bail on FI and go to carburetion? 

This is a more complicated question. I'd say probably not, since I'm into
stock and I like FI (I have a '78). Depending on where you live you might
produce an unsmoggable vehicle if you put an older engine in your '77.  That
certainly wouldn't fly in CA. 

&gt; - '77 case w/FI
&gt; - earlier heads (1800) ...dude knew I was building a 2.0 liter FI 
&gt; engine, but...the heads he's already sold me (are) (1800/2000 
heads). 

This is not a big deal. I am also running 1800 heads on my 2.0 Liter engine.
Good 2.0 liter heads are pretty hard to come by and/or are expensive when you
do find them. 1800 head can be made to fit just fine, are more plentiful, and
cheaper. A 2.0L engine is really just 1.9L or so to begin with, so you don't
lose much displacement. 

&gt; Now, in trying to figure out where I'm going to mount all my FI  stuff 
&gt; inside the '72 bus...

This will require a little creativity on your part but is certainly 
do-able in principle.

&gt; ...I've never *seen* a FI engine installed...

You'd obviously better check one out before you try to do this. I 
suyppose you might come up with something that works working blind, but 
why frustrate yourself and produce a one-of-a-kind thing that no one can 
work on 'cept you??

&gt; So, where do I go from here? If I plug that EGR valve, I'll run rich, 
&gt; won't I? 
&gt; If I leave that thing sucking air, I'll run lean and probably damage 
&gt; the FI, right?

YOu won't be able to start the bus if you leave it sucking air- it'll be 
that lean. You either need to install the thing or else plug the holes, 
or else install the EGR valve and leave it disconnected, in its default 
OFF position. Either way you decide to go, have the fuel mix adjusted 
after you've installed it (this requires an exhaust sniffer) and you'll 
be fine. You'd want to do this fuel mix adjustment after any rebuild 
anyways, so it's not an extra step.

1972 is the dreaded bad year- throttle linkage parts no longer available,
hard to smog, dual carbs are a PITA (or so I've heard). So going stock 1972
could be a hassle if you're not already set up. In CA you can install later
year engines in older cars and you have to meet the later year smog standard. 
So if you went '78 engine in CA you'd have to get the EGR working to pass
smog. And I might as well be the one to tell you that EGR parts are 
pricey. Definitely shop for used ones if you can.

And if you went older, like to the much loved '71 engine, you'd never
pass smog under any circumstances until 2002 when your car would be 25 years
old and you'd be excempt under new smog laws. 

Your actual mileage may vary.

Good luck,
