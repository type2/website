Subject: Rare brake shoes

 &gt;Your tale of woe is familiar. I had terrible trouble with my 73 when I
 &gt;decided to renew the brake shoes at the rear. Basically, the problem
 &gt;came down to getting the correct shoe. VW seem to have used at lease 4
 &gt;different designs between 72 and 75. My particular vehicle has the
 &gt;rarest type which were only fitted for 6 months.

Did you investigate getting them recoated (or whatever they call it!)? Here 
in Australia you can get changeover shoes for popular models. I presume 
they must have a process for recoating the old ones.
