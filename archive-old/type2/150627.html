&amp;gt; Actually &amp;quot;Worm &amp;amp; Peg&amp;quot; Steering Boxes are what was originally installed on
&amp;gt; the 68-72 Bay Window.  You can use the 73-79 Worm &amp;amp; Roller, but a bit of
&amp;gt; modifying is needed I believe.  Upgrading to the later Pittman Arm is one
&amp;gt; thing you have to do (the output shaft is larger).

No, the later box uses different mounting holes and the &amp;quot;neck&amp;quot; is larger,
so it won't fit on an early Bay.  This has been discussed before and the
consensus is that modifying to allow use of a later box is prohibative.

Makes me be very gentle to my existing box!
