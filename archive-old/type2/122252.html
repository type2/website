Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical inlet

You might want to take it off before painting.
And that was silver too, with a sticker on
it.  Mine says something about where it was made.
willis

  one more ?,
  73 Westy...
  the electrical inlet on the driver side sticks out from the body with a
plate around it..
  should the inlet and plate be body color? white?
  what was stock?
  I'm taking her in for paint Monday and want to make sure they know what to
paint what colors for the dual color bus.
  thanks!
