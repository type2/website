I had said previously that '' 55 1/4&quot; was for split buses''. This is the
length of the REAR bar. The front bar has to be shorter. When I measured the
width of the brackets, I measured the rear ones. I neglected to measure the
front ones. I think the front one will be around 47&quot; but I won't know
exactly until I measure one.
