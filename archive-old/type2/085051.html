Subject: RE: [T2] Dyno test

Not a good comparison.

You are comparing &quot;at the wheels&quot; versus &quot;at the flywheel&quot; on an engine
dyno.

I think generally the power loss at the wheels is 15% compared to flywheel
HP???

Plus with 30,000 miles on a rebuild of unknown quality the question is
unanswerable.  Who built the engine?  How hot does it get? What type of
driving?  Blah blah blah...

Granted it is interesting to see those numbers! Thanks.
