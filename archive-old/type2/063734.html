Wow.  That sucker must really be on there tight then.  It took me quite a 
while to get mine off but I sat on it quite a while.  It was enough that 
that compressor fired up once to recharge itself.  The nut finally came 
loose.  Otherwise, you'll have to visit with some of other members who 
have used flywheel locks and angle iron from old beds.
