I think the correct procedure is to tighten the nut/clamp up fairly
tight, like maybe 30 ft/lbs or so.  Then loosen enough that you can
slide a .006&quot; feeler gauge between the nut and washer.  I'm not 100%
sure offhand if that it the right value, but it's around in there.
Bentley or Haynes probably have it.  I remember reading this method
somewhere, probably in one of these two books.
