Subject: Re: [T2] Heads interchangeable?

Hi Rob,

Yes.... But if you are running FI with a carb'd 1.8 head you will  
need to drill and tap it for the head temp sensor.

If it's a 1.8 FI head you may have to drill a hole in the 2L engine  
tin to allow the lead from the sensor to reach the harness. IIRC  
there is no such hole in the 2L tin.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
