Subject: Cold Hard Tranny Problem Solved
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&lt;I can't get the Beast into 1st or 2nd when it's cold.&gt;

The problem is solved,
Before pulling the tranny I decided to give the shift linkage a thorough
inspection and found that the rear shifter coupling (the coupling that
attaches the linkage to the front of the tranny) was busted.  On the
visual inspection I performed earlier it looked just fine, but when I
went back and inspected it with my hand I discovered that the rubber had
disintegrated from one side of it.  Yipee, I don't have to pull the
tranny.  I guess the fact that it happened when it got cold here was
just a coincidence.

Thanks to all the replies I received.  Everybody suggested it was in the
linkage somewhere and sure enough, it was.
