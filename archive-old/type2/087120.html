Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Message to VWoA &amp; MVVC

Sigh,

They *did*...I don't understand it either, but they also got MICROBUS!

Guys, I have personally driven and worked on vw's since 1966 and maybe I'm 
just in a crabby mood, but this just takes the cake!  I get madder every 
time I think about it.

Sort of like using the middle of your living room floor for
the bathroom.

I'm really bad at analogies&lt;grin&gt;.


mad at vwag, dave

&gt; &gt; Here's one of the strange things about us trademark law. A lot of
&gt; &gt; times (from what i understand) to backup claims of trademark
&gt; &gt; infringement you must show that you have tried to protect that
&gt; &gt; trademark previously. That means that if VWoA didn't go after anyone &amp;
&gt; &gt; one day decided to, it would be quite hard for them to stop the other
&gt; &gt; party from using things like bug or bus. I don't know how much of the
&gt; &gt; claims VW makes would actually hold up in court, but most people don't
&gt; &gt; have the deep pockets like VWoA.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not strange at all. The theory is, if you don't defend your mark you
&gt; must not care about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what's weird to me: &quot;Bug&quot; seems like a pretty solid trademark for a
&gt; car (as is &quot;Beetle&quot;) because only Volkswagen makes &quot;Bug&quot; shaped cars. But
&gt; &quot;Bus&quot;? Let's see...school bus, short bus, muni bus, hippie bus, tour bus,
&gt; Greyhound bus, IEEE 1394 bus, universal serial bus...not to mention busboys
&gt; and busman's holidays! How can you trademark Bus?
