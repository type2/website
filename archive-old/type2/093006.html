Subject: Re: [T2] one more time...shift mechanism housing...


&gt;The front buffer is to help align for shifting. however the first and 
&gt;second gear shifting would be hitting the other guide.  I believe you are 
&gt;concentrating on one piece when shifting problems can come from more than 
&gt;one location.  you have a linkage in the middle and more at the rear at 
&gt;the transmission.  Check the bushings at the rear (at the transmission).

All correct information. You could have sloppy shifter linkage, misadjusted 
clutch, or the shifter nose on the tranny itself could be worn. The input 
shaft for the shifter should fit nice and snug - free to move but no axial 
slop. Also inside this housing is the shifter rods (for the lack of a 
better term). These could be worn or not setup correctly. Bentley shows the 
procedure and it looks to be pretty involved.

Lastly there could be internal damage that prevents the tranny from working 
correctly.

Start with the simple stuff and work your way back.
