Subject: DA'BUS LIVES!!!!!!!!!

After nearly a month of being &quot;non-running&quot;, 

 

Da'Bus roared to life _at_ 11:26pm (Monday night),

Steady Ideal was achieved _at_ 12:15am (had to go get gas in a different
vehicle)

Dogs are loaded and the wife and I are going for a quick &quot;drive about&quot;

 

Latter
