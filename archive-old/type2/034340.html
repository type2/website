Subject: Burning points....

Long time listener, first time caller...

Searched the archives, but nothing seems to fit my situation...

Problem: '78 C.E. Westy, ~1600 miles on rebuild. New condenser. Inside
distributor is CLEAN, except for the normal grease on the lobes and 1 drop of
oil on the points pivot. Timing is 50 degrees dwell, .016&quot; gap, and 8.5 BTDC.
All's about how it should be. Goes through a set of points in about 500 miles.
(note: did this before the rebuild) Distributor cap new, as are wires and plugs
and plug caps.

What it's NOT: I have a radio, and I do leave it on for long periods of time,
but it is connected to my 2nd battery which runs all interior accessories and
is completely isolated from the rest of the bus's electrical system. So the
ignition does not need to be on to power radio.

I'm thinking the coil may be on it's last legs?

I've checked for voltage across the points while everything is off.... and
nothing.

Anyone have any clues?

(Been thinking about getting a whatsit, but I'd like to get this problem sorted
out before then. It could turn a minor problem of fiddling with points alot
into a bigger problem)
