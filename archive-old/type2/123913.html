Subject: Accordian Tubes

All this talk of heat exchangers, which I am also replacing in the near
future, got me to thinking about another issue that I possess with
Freidrich, and that is accordian tubes.  The PO put a 1.8 T4 motor in there
and for whatever reason the old accordian tubes never made it back into the
bus.  Instead, what was used was some material that is similar to tinfoil on
steroids with a rather heavy glue or some such adhesive.  Someone basically
orgamii'd themselves some ghetto accordian tubes out of this stuff.  I can't
wait to tear that s*#t out and put in some accordian tubes that I acquired
from a boneyard off another late bay.

Question:  Are all accordian tubes the same?

  Before I get under there and knock a whole lot of road trash into my face
making these fit I would like to know if the diameters are going to mate
and/or if they were typically all of the same length.

When I say accordian tubes I am talking of the heavy rubber flex tubing with
asbestos/metal screen interior lining that connects the main heating duct
under the bus to the heater controls/heater boxes in the rear.
