Subject: Heating questions

Hi all,

I am about to restore heat to my '78 Westy. The previous owner had pretty much
gutted the system so I'm kind of working from scratch. I have acquired most of
the parts I need (thanks Duncan) aside from some cables, gaskets and a couple
of hoses. There are few things I'm unsure of though.
1) How does the electric fan mount? In my Haynes manual it appears to hang
from the top of the engine compartment. Am I missing a bracket?
2) Does anyone know of a good source for the hoses that run under the length
of the bus? Preferably tighter and better insulated than the paper ones.
3) Does anyone know where I can find a good diagram of the heating system and
its duct work? The Haynes pictures are pretty mediocre.
4) In the Haynes manual it looks like there are a couple of clam shell type
pieces that mount to the rear of the heater boxes where the air from the
engine fan enters. Is this correct? If so does anyone have some they would
like to sell?

Any other advice before I tackle this project would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Doug
