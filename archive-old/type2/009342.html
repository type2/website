Guys, i have my Bentley right here.
Quote page 40 of section five table d:

--Dual Carburetor and Fuel Injection Engine Valve Dimensions--

Valve head diameter (1700): Intake- 39.30mm  Exhaust- 33.0mm

Valve head diameter (1800 dual-carb): Intake- 41.00mm  Exhaust- 34.00mm

Valve head diameter (1800 Fuel injection): Intake- 39.30mm  Exhaust- 33.00mm

Valve head diameter (2000 Fuel injection): Intake- 37.50mm  Exhaust- 33.00mm


Quote from &quot;engine and clutch technical data-dual carburetor AND fuel
injection engines&quot; section 5, page 84 table 'V':

D. Camshaft:
Cam follower diameter: 23.96-23.98

As far as the cam goes, dual carb and FI engines appear to be the same.

&gt; &gt; I gotta disagree with this.  The cam and valves are NOT different for FI
vs
&gt; &gt; carb-ed engines (were talking type IV VW motors here).  The cam is
different
&gt; &gt; for engines with hydraulic valves.  Valve sizes differ for the 1700, 1800,
&gt; &gt; and 2000 engines.
&gt; 
&gt;      My understanding was that all FI cams were different as well. Be
&gt; that as it may, the hydraulic cam definitely has different valve timing
&gt; and lift, and FI engines were made for more years with hydraulic than
&gt; solid, so at least those are different. And most certainly engineered by
&gt; the VW elves in their infinite wisdom to work best with FI.
