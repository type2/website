Subject: Curtains

I was just thinking with that last curtain post (which by the way you could 
just hang those metal rods that were stock with the busses, or the white 
wire cord on the windows; i've found them at the junkyard before)

is anyone interested in getting curtains made?  I am a sewer and have made 
my own curtains.  If you send me that material you want to have them made 
out of we could work out a deal.

Busses are much nicer with a clean new set of curtains.  I haven't mastered 
the front windshield curtain because of the buttons, but I have rigged mine 
to stick up with velcro and it works pretty good.

let me know:

happy bussing
