Subject: Re: [T2] Greetings,(New listee) W/ no spark brain teaser!!!

Auto thief 101- to hot wire a older car that dosen't
have a locking steering wheel is very simple, aligator
clips (2) one wire long enough to reach from the coil
to the battery. Disconect hot wire from + side of
coil, connect jumper wire to coil(+) then to
battery(+). make sure car is in netural, slide under
and short solinoid (big wire to little wire) on
starter - car starts. I would wrather check for 12V at
the coil(+),and fix what is wrong with the car, its
easer. Phil
