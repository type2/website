Subject: Re: [T2] Side window swap

Hiya Tony,

No problem at all.  

Your 70 rear side window plus vent will fit in your 68 opening just like it 
was made for it.  However, do be aware that the joint along the vent rubber 
and the window rubber can be a source for leaks.  You might want to use some 
sealant along that edge when you install.

You'll need both seals - one for the window and one for the vent.  The vent 
seal is a spendy little devil - around $55US.  I'd go visit the folks at 
Wolfsburg West or The Bus Depot.
