Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Popped valve seat picture

 &gt;Just went to a campout a couple of weekends ago in the bus.._dot_carrying
4 people and gear....two of the people were.....large.....

We got to taling about it as it was *up* a lot of hills and I had
to downshift a lot.  The last 5 miles were done on dirt roads at about
20mph.

We figured we were at close to 1200-1500 lbs of people/stuff....and that
was before I remembered that the A/C system alone probably added another
 &gt;200 lbs.

Do you know what your head temps were?

Martin.
