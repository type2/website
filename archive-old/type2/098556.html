&gt; ...i forgot that the new CV boot came with a tube of grease, so

&gt; of grease for the CVs or is this grease ok?

Not a big problem.  just pull the boot back, wipe as much of the incorrect
grease out as you can, then pack with the correct stuff.  A little of the
incorrect grease won't hurt.

Latex gloves and lots of paper towels make this job tolerable.
