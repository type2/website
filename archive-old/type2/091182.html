Subject: Help! Oil leaks without engine running? Help!

Hi All,
my bus leaks. While running, after running but what
really scares me is that it leaks while just sitting
there. It apears that the majority of oil is dripping
off the bottom of the engine case off the longer
____    ____
    \__/
       O &lt;---oil drip (side view) (there is two fins
on either side that drop down a little longer than the
others. Know what I mean?)

aluminium cooling fins mostly on the right but also a
little on the left side of the engine. The pushrods
are not immersed in oil are they? what about the oil
cooler? Help. Giles Clement
