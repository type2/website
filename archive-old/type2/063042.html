San Diego has lots of splitties. I see at least one a day; I've seen three
splittie double cabs in the past two weeks. Perhaps everyone can come here
before the trip to Baja next year to pick up a splittie for the journey :).
The downside to the overabundance of splitties is that no one waves,
presumably because they are so common

So I wrote:
I lived down there for five years and Brother Joe speaks truely!
I'm in Santa Barbara now, and there are somesplitties  around, but not so many 
as in SD. Every time I go to Santa Cruz, I'm astonished at the numbers there.
It's a smaller town than SD, but with way more buses per capita.
Many loafs there, possibly due to the abundance of hippie/ Deadhead/ 
young-clingers-to things-'70's.

I don't get waves (from the Honorable and Distinguished Internat'l Order of 
Type 2 Enthusiasts) much in any of those places. Your arm would get tired.

Just another way of saying what's been said before: More clean buses left
in California (Esp. southern &amp; central)  than probably anyplace.
