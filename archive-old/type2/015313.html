&gt;Guys,
&gt;I want to replace my *ordinary* ignition with an electronic one...
&gt;Pros?

Never replace points again. Timing remains rock solid unless 
the shaft is heavily worn. Generally speaking, a good thing.
That's why after the kinks were worked out, the Germans made
them the stock system.

&gt;Cons?
 
Only associated with the cheap immitations. Buy the brand name
products (Pertronix, Jacobs, Mallory) and follow instructions. 
If the box does blow or anything else should go wrong, be sure to 
have a set of points/plate/condenser/coil so you can put them back 
in and not be broke down. You can't monkey rig a black box at the
side of the road. A good one costs a lot more than a set
of points. If it zaps you when your screwdriver pokin' back there
it could kill you if you have a pace maker or bring you back to
life if your ticker stopped, if you add the hot box and coil. 

The trigger wheels are likely much
more precise than the cam, particularly if worn. As there is no
contact with either a light beam or magnetic trigger, there is
no cam in play to affect the timing via wear. I would expect the
wear curve of the shaft to flatten out some as well. 

&gt;Performance?

If you add only a trigger to replace the points/condenser, none.
If you add a hot coil and CD black box, you will get longer life
for spark plugs if the motor has wear and would otherwise foul
out the plugs. Rule of thumb, more spark energy, more throughough
combustion. On a stock motor, the gains are in the low single digit
percentages. 

&gt;Cost?

For a trigger system only that you hook up to your stock coil, less
than $100. A middin CD box could be another hundred, a really good
one could be twice that. Hot coils, 40 to 50k volts, 30 to 50 bucks.

Let's see. How many sets of points can we get for $300????????????

Does anyone have experience with swapping a complete Bosch electronic
system from one of the later models to the older ones. If you could do
that with a junk yard donor you might get the cost down to something
more reasonable. And nothing is more reliable than a Bosch.

The only direct experiance I have with an update to electronic was on
a BMW motorcycle. The point cam on my machine was off by 5 degrees. I
had to set timing to 2.5 advance on one cylinder and 2.5 retard on the
other. The spec was + or - 3 degrees so I was within spec. However, I
like enhanced specifications. I put a Dyna III ignition on it. It had
adjustable magnetic sensors and I got both cylinders to + or - 0.5
degrees. Smooooooooth idle. I never touch timing again for 60k and
12 years. No increase in MPG was noted. It remained above 50mpg at
all times, even from Salinas to Yakima in 18 hours. THAT was a magnificent
piece of engineering. I knew when I sold it I would regret it and I
do, but the Porsche I replaced it with is the same high quality and
function.
