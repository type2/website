Subject: Cost Effectiveness of Points Replacement Conversions?

&gt;Hmmm I see you are a fan. I didn't mean to be &gt;disparaging,

Beauty is in the Jim Hayden of the beholder, as I always say.

&gt;A newbie would be completely lost.

A fair statement, however the subject matter was not exactly newbie-oriented, it was directed at those who have mechanical aptitude enough to re-engineer.

No offense meant to you Courtney, there's just been a lot of one liner posts lately where you think you're gonna read someone's correlational anecdote or obscure factoid and you get Beavis and Butthead instead.

huh huh, huh.

Billy
