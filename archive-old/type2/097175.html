Subject: Re: [T2] Engine sealing

[...]


&gt; While checking my engine for proper seals , I noticed that where the
&gt; alternator is , I could see daylight while looking from underneath the motor
&gt; .Was there a seal around the alternator , to the sheet metal . I have a 78 .
&gt; Thanks

Yes, there is supposed to be a seal ring there. There were two different ones.
It depends on the coverplate you have. They are not interchangeable. I could
not find it pictured anywhere but if you go here:
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/aircoolsystem.html and look at K, you will see a note
about the seal. Bus Boys calls it a 'plastic gasket'. Part # 022-903-203
I always try to keep them together as sets when I remove engine tin.
