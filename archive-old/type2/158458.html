Subject: Re: [T2] really rough idle, shaking whole bus

 If you have:
&gt; tried a new plug on #1
&gt; swapped the plug wires on #1
&gt; swapped the injector wires from #1 to #2
&gt; and #1 is still dead......
&gt;
&gt; Don't bother with the injector spray yet.
&gt;
&gt; Your next step is to test the compression on #1.....
&gt;
Karl and everyone else,

forgive my ignorance,  why would i want to test compression?  couldn't the
injector just be bad, i hope, ihope that's all it is.  the plug electrode
was dry when i pulled it.  wouldn't this indicate no fuel being sprayed into
the chamber?  this speculation is mostly wishful on my part since i have no
tools with which to test the compression and can't afford a mechanic
presently.  anyway, thanks for your time and knowlegde.
