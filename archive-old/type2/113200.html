    &quot;Oh Matt, you have obviously never driven 10 hours to a
bus campout in North Carolina (from Ohio) with a 10,
4, and 2 year old!!  Remember when you were a kid, how
long did it take you to get bored with &quot;I Spy&quot; and
looking out the window? I remember being bored about
30 minutes into the trip.&quot;

Check out our Westy on http://www.geocities_dot_com/mike_benthin
It went on a 6 week trip (often over 8 hrs driving a day) around the
country....The VCR, TV/Sega got lots of use when daughter was bored.
We (the non-driver too) would watch movies......
