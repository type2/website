Subject: Microbus Sighting----WOW !!

Well here's a story of all stories---and I rubbed my eyes in awe.

I was running some errends on the way to work this morning--and what
came out odf a sidestreet --right in front of me--was none other than a
brand spanking new 2005 modle VW micro bus---

Wait a minute----I haven't heard a word about these thigs in some
time--I thought the program was on the back burnner---

Anyway--I try like a madman to catch tis guy in a Cherry Red Bus--slit
tail lights---one big oval exhaust pipe dead nuts ithe center of the
bumper--booking down the road --pulling away from me--
I tried like all hell to catch him but he caught a light at an
intersection on the yellow--and I was dead--no go on red--even though I
wanted to bad.

It was soon was out of sight--and  couldn't find it for the life of
me---

So--I call VW---my buddy the parts mgr.

Oh yea--that Bus has been here---

It is at Motorola ( world headquarter's) for a year--for software
evaluation and testing---
Just like the Toureg was, and the Phaeton is--- 

I said--get outa here !!!

So tomorrow on the way to work--with camera in hand--I'm taking a detour
to Moterola--and see what I can see---

My God--was this thing a neat looking ride---

I want one bad--!!!

Reports, and possibly pictures of a Micro on the road to follow--( I
hope ) 
I am on a mission to find this thing---and maybe talk the guy into a
ride---It ain't but 4 miles away--

See ya---

Your Mild Mannered wandering Hungaian reporter--in the Windy---
