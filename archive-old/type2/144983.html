Subject: Re: [T2] $235 Oil Pump????

&gt; Seems like a ripoff to me

Seems like supply/demand on 30 year old German parts.  Not that it makes me
happy.

&gt; the Mexicans were/are still building them

The bug WAS being produced in Mexico, the bus IS begin produced in Brazil,
with the type 2 upright engine (1600) as far as I know.

&gt; You can substitute a CB
&gt; pump for it though. Check out
&gt; http://cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=195
&gt; 32 dollars, made for the 914/Type 4

It is there.  Anybody used one?

Billy
