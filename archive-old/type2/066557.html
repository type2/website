Subject: Re: Type IV Cases - availability? -Reply

As a matter of fact, I was also in the market for just that last summer.
Found one at &quot;Eurorace&quot; in Cali.

2.0 Crankcase-$229
No core, and it is rebuilt (I don't know how you rebuild a case, unless
machine it)
As for a 914 case, I don't know the price but they probably have it.
You can reach them at 1-800-722-8678 or in Cali (310)376-0247.
Located at 2899 West 190th St. Redondo Beach Cali 90278
Fax (310)372-7772

To all:
They have a ton of 1.7-2.0 Bus parts that are pretty cheap and also do a
lot of machining that is very reasonable. There is also one located in
Maryville TN. And so far have been a big help.


&gt; Anyone know about the price and availabilty of _new_ Type IV engine
cases?
&gt;  &gt; A friend of mine is looking for one for a 914.
&gt;  &gt; Thanks!

I have a ton of good used Type 2/4 cases at work.  I could go $150, plus
shipping...plus a small core charge, but could work someting out if you
want it outright...
