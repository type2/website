I had thought that M. Kim And Mike meant that he had a gas leak into the
distributor, i.e.

&gt;&gt;I am leaking on the left side of my engine case.  I
&gt;&gt;had that happen before, but it was my carbs throttle shaft.

I've had that happen before due to a ruptured diaphragm (I think that was
why). Clarification would be good, an oil leak is not good but it doesn't
hold a candle to a fuel leak...
