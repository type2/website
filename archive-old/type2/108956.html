Subject: F.S. Brand New 3/4 Bench Seat Uphoslstery in Beige from TMI (I
  screwed up)

    Well my mistake may end up being good news for someone out there!
Somehow I managed to order the completely wrong seat upholstery for my bus.
So now I have an extra set of upholstery, brand new, in the box! Here is the
description:  Seat Upholstery, 3/4 Middle Bench Seat, TMI Orig Style
Basketweave Vinyl, Beige This is part number 8086BEB at bus depot. I am
seriously hoping that someone out there is in need of this upholstery. If
you are, contact me off list and we can try to strike up a deal.
