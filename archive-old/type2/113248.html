Subject: Re: [T2] Re: my bus has NOTHING to do with ScoobyDoo!!

&lt;&lt;During one episode, they were driving along in the Mystery Machine when it 
broke down. Freddie went to check the engine and lo and behold, it was in the 
rear! &gt;&gt;

My 5 year old recently discovered Scooby Doo on video. We saw one in which the 
MM brokedown. Shaggy and Scoob were dispatched to fetch water for the radiator, 
which was  at the back of the van. Hmmm, maybe the MM was an early prototype 
for watercooled conversions. ;-)
