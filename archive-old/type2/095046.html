Subject: Re: [T2] Charging problems..

Howdy Rogelio,

A good place to start is making sure you don't have a dead battery. I just 
lost one after my bus sat for three weeks in another town. (Circumstances 
beyond my control)

Put a good charge on it an take it somewhere to have it checked. Autozone 
does this free if you have one in your town. I'm sure other places do too. 
Check that positive cable too. If its got green stuff growing on it its 
probably no good.

If all that's OK it's time to start looking at your generator.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
Now the generator light comes on when I
&gt;rev-up the engine
&gt;(accelerating or downshifting) or when I turn on the headlights, turn 
&gt;signals and radio together
&gt;(i.e. under &quot;heavy&quot; electrical load). This morning it would not start, like 
&gt;it has a dead battery.
&gt;
&gt;Any idea what could be the cause?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks a lot for your help.
&gt;
&gt;Rogelio
&gt;'69 &quot;la vebe&quot;
