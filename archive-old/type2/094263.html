Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing front wheel bearings-tips

This is a great tool for punching races into the hubs:

&gt; The Bearing Race &amp; Seal Driver tool
&gt; http://store.yahoo_dot_com/rodi/lis12600.html

I've only done it once but it sold me.  It's not metric which ends up being
an ideal fit for our races.

&gt; We got our Westy with 60k mi on it, and I finally decided to replace the
&gt; front wheel bearings as one wheel was loose and would not tighten up
&gt; without creaks.  Spent 5 hours to reach the stage of replacing the hubs-
&gt; removed the wheels, brake pads, blew out the dust and crap, compressed
&gt; the pistons, removed and hung up the calipers, removed the rotors (phew,
&gt; the allen bolts came out), removed the hubs, and cleaned, cleaned,
&gt; cleaned everthing......turns out one outer bearing race had pitting on
&gt; one side, and the roller bearings were all teribly pitted too-haddda run
&gt; hot that way.   The other side was quite clean but darkened.  Both inner
&gt; races/bearings looked good.  A fender washer fit the inside of the small
&gt; bearing race fine, and I beat out the small races with a socket on a
&gt; 1/2&quot; extension.  The larger one required a punch to be used in circles
&gt; until it came out.  I dug out my 25 yr old pipe pieces I had used
&gt; intitially on the 71 Westy, which are about 4&quot; long and sized to fit the
&gt; races so they can be tapped in.  I took the old races and ground them
&gt; down so they would just fit within the race lands.  So as not the stress
&gt; the pressed in lugs, I used a stepped 1&quot;13/16th socket stood on a vice
&gt; anvil; it just fits inside the small bearing land.  I held the pipe over
&gt; the new races and tapped it with a sledge- after it was flush, used the
&gt; old race as a guide for the pipe.    Went in fine without resorting to
&gt; heating the hub and cooling the race.  The stubs of the axles have a
&gt; groove worn in the bottom due to upward stress the inner races pushing
&gt; up- but the good side rolled fine this way.  Might induce a slight
&gt; camber change, but I had the wheels aligned already recently.
