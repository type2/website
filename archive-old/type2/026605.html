Subject: Exhaust needed for a '72 bus
Message-ID: &lt;D8DE0BCF64C7D2119D120000F810EE4E19D999_at_chachaois9.cha.tva_dot_gov&gt;

We just returned from a 1415 mile trip to busses by the lake in Tampa/St.
Petersburg.  My '72 ran GREAT, except that it developed a rust hole in the
aftermarket muffler (extractor style).  Does anyone have a good condition
'72 muffler for sale?  If so, please let me know.

Thanks,
Stuart Neil
