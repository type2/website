Subject: Re: [T2] Cracked case

As I sit here pondering on this I have a few more questions:
    is it possible to just purchase a case and use what I already have in my
current motor? If I went this route, I would essentially be doing a rebuild
and need new rings, gaskets, etc, right?
    someone suggested welding, but the location is prohibitive of that
option.
    Lastly, I am running Castrol 20W-50, should I stick with this or run a
heavier oil?
Later,
