couple of things come to mind.
A. Tranny
B.Linkage
lets hope it is the linkage

1. check you shift plate on the floor, it may be out of whack.
move it back and fourth, it could also be a syncro

2. check you center and rear shift rods ,they may be bent or need
to have the crap scraped off of them and oiled up.
