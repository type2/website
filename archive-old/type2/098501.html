&gt; &gt; &gt; Should ignition time be set according to your engine code as in the Bentley?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I run dual Dell'orto 36's, on a GE 2 liter engine, so the F.I. is not in
&gt; &gt; &gt; there anymore.....Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Iginition timing should always and everywhere be set to match the
&gt; &gt; *distributor*!  Which reminds me, I still have not written up the long
&gt; &gt; post on distributors that I promised a bit back.... soon, volks, soon :-(
&gt;
&gt; at least most of the time  ;8*}

Bob,

I am sorry, I but I am confused.  When should ignition timing be set to
anything other than the distributor?  or where?  Do you mean he should be
setting his timing to match the block number?  Do you mean that he should
be setting it to match his carb?
