Subject: heater cables question

I'm trying to figure out where all these heater cables go on my 78
westy.  I bought 2 new replacement cables that go to the heater boxes.
Here's what I need to know:

-Which of the heater box cables is left and which is right (one has a
bend, one has a loop), and which lever(s) do they attach to?
-there is a third (broken) cable coming up from somewhere - where does
that go to and which lever does it hook up to?

I'd really appreaciate any input!

thanks,
Mike
