Okay. I have solved the vibration I was experiencing up through the shifter.
I examined the linkage and noticed a missing front bushing and another loose
rubber doohinky. I fixed those up.. greased the linkage up very vell... and
voila! no more rattling sounds.

Phew!! I thought it might have been the Throw-Out bearing from what everyone
had suggested.

Thanks all,

Brian
