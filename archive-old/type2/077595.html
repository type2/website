&gt; It is my understanding that a tuned exhaust is the most efficient method of 
&gt; &quot;exhausting&quot; your engine short of no exhaust pipe at all.  

IMHO a well designed exhaust system will out perform &quot;no exhaust pipe&quot;.
Bear in mind that a VW exhaust system is designed to be quiet and provide a 
source of heat. Exhaust systems can be tuned to help give a good spread of 
power or a good or maximum power but over a limited engine speed. Exhaust 
system design seems to be a black art that every one has an opinion on.
