Subject: Re: [T2] Speedo Issue

&gt; Hello all
&gt; My speedo is acting weird. When I am holding a rather constant cruising
&gt; speed, my speedo is jumping around (about 3 mph of movement, bouncing back
&gt; and forth). Its kind of annoying. Any ideas on why this might be happening.
&gt; Thanks!

the cable, sticking.
you can try to grease it or...
better. replace it.
