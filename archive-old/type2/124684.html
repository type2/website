I have not dealt with this company myself, but there was a very good article
about them in my local paper. I actually downloaded the software but have not
taken time to play with it yet. Countless applications I guess if you can
justify the cost.

Have not had that much experience with my bus yet, but I know that the little
plastic gear that drives the odometer in the spedo of the 181s frequently
breaks. To my knowledge a replacement for the simple little sprocket is not
available requiring a replacement of an otherwise good spedo to get a working
odometer.

Could be a good application.

I don't remember where I found this but these people make parts for you and
it's all done on line. Depending on what you need it might be an answer.

Other than reading on their site and an article in CNN I don't know
anything about them.
