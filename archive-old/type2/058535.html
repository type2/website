Subject: picture of 911 engine in a bus

Well, a picture of my 911 in the bus is at
http://econwpa.wustl_dot_edu/~samid/bus-stuff/porsche.jpg
but the file is about 150K.

Some day I might have time to put up more pictures, but it's gonna be a
while. And no, the conversion is not quite finished yet.

Sami
