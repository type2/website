Subject: a woodpecker in my engine?

anytime that i rev my engine up real hi, it sounds like their is a 
woodpecker back there. it doesnt matter if i am just reving the engine or if 
i am out driving. But the noise is only noticable at hi rev's. I have a 
stock 72 with the 1700cc type4 engine. Thanks
