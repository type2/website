Subject: Re: [T2] cross your fingers

&gt; What was the one vehicle (VW or other-
&gt; wise) that any of the list members wish they had held onto..

72 Mazda Rx-2

Sold it for $500.  Probably not worth much more now either, although
it's more rare than a sunroof deluxe splittie since the engines had a
habit of failing after 40000 miles.  It was a nice car and fun to
drive.  Fun to maintain, too.  2 distributors and 3 sets of points...
