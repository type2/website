&gt; To reiterate the admin position on Bus Depot, we have no problem
&gt; with people airing their bad experiences with Bus Depot.  That's part of
the deal Ron
&gt; signed up for.  However, it is good form on the part of the customer to
USE
&gt; ANY AND ALL MEANS POSSIBLE to resolve a customer service issue with Bus
&gt; Depot itself before posting to the list about it.  It's certainly not fair
&gt; to Ron to post to the list when you haven't even
&gt; called them (and not the order line) to find out what's up.
&gt;
&gt; This post may seem biased toward Bus Depot but consider I've never seen a
&gt; post from Ron saying &quot;boy this customer really sucks, he never
&gt; pays on time and he always changes the order at the last minute.&quot;



Well, I've taken a few deep breaths, and spent a quiet Mothers Day with my
wife and 2-year-old trying to get my mind off of things for at least one
day.  Heartfelt thanks for all the words of support, both on the list and
via pmail from many listmembers, and thanks to Sean for interjecting his
voice of reason as well.

If people would just try to follow a couple of simple steps I think this
sort of thing could be easily avoided...

1.  Understand that this is a good-faith relationship. Please treat us with
the assumption that we are not here to rip you off.  If I were out to rip
anybody off I'd have been booted off of this list years ago.  Yes, mistakes
happen. Shipping delays happen.  Backorders happen.  But never with the
intention of keeping anyone from their parts or their money.  We're all
human.  If you have never made a mistake in your entire life, then you are
uniquely qualified to expect the same standards of me. Also, nobody likes to
deal with an abusive customer.  The simple reality is that any employee will
be much more inclined to go out of their way to help you if you treat them
like a human being. (Of course it's a two way street; if you ever do not
feel that you got the same treatment by a Bus Depot employee I want to know
about it.)

2.  As Sean said, if you think something is wrong with your order, please
tell US, not 1000 people on the list. How would you feel if someone dragged
YOUR name through the mud to hundreds of people?  If you do not get a
satisfactory response via email or the Customer Service line, I have always
encouraged listmembers to email me directly. (Please do not make that your
first recourse, however.  Not that I don't want to help everybody
personally, but if I were to spend all of my time answering questions that
my employees can easily answer, I'd have no time left to actually buy the
parts and run the business.)  If all other recourse fails, then you are most
welcome to mercilessly flog me on the list. :-)

3.  Please read the terms of sale that are posted on the website and in my
catalog before ordering.  90% of the complaints I get, both here and at the
shop, stem from the fact that the person simply didn't read the terms in the
first place or they wouldn't be complaining.  There is a reason why I make
you click through that page when you place an online order and put it on the
inside cover of every catalog.  The terms clearly specify that you must
order via expedited delivery or else allow 7-10 working days for standard
delivery (perhaps longer if an item is backordered). They clearly spell out
all of our policies and procedures on returns, backorders, shipment, etc.
They also clearly specify that the toll-free order line is strictly for
part-number ordering (with no exceptions).  If you don't agree with the
terms of sale, I fully understand; just don't order.


Thanks...now what do you say we go back to talking about busses!
