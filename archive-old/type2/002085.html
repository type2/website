Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak at sending unit 71 type 1 engine
Date: Wed, 6 Sep 2000 23:46:33 -0700

As has been discussed here in the past, the oil pressure sending units
frequently leak _through_ the sender.  The threads seal and ground OK in the
crankcase, but the oil leaks out between the non-metallic innards of the
unit and the unit's case.

This problem is becoming universal, it seems, and isn't confined to senders
from any particular country of manufacture.

Lots more in the archives.....
