The Minneapolis-St.Paul area has Dune Buggy Supply
(don't recall actual address) which has done well by
me, for the few things I ever take somewhere away from
home. I have heard good things about some of the other
people in the area too, but haven't dealt with anyone
else.
There is a VW club in the Twin Cities, and another new
one in the Eau Claire, Wis. area, an hour and a half
east of the twin cities.  Both clubs have a show in
June, and the Twin Cities club has had a couple of
swap meets at other times during the year.  I haven't
participated too much in the past, but each year we
find time to attend more of the club activities.
I used to live in Madison, WI, but that was 20 years
ago or more, and therefore I can't recommend anyone
there.
To us in Wisconsin or Minnesota, the state of Ohio is
one of those eastern states.
