Greetings listees! I was wondering if there was anyone in the Greater Seattle 
or Everett, Washington area that would be willing to a) mentor a VW newbie, 
b) offer up any good mechanics in my area, c) offer a place where I may fix 
my clutch (would probably take me several days, as I have not done it 
before.) I am willing to do the work, just need a place to do it. I live in 
an apartment complex where they don't allow that type of thing. Any help 
would be appreciated. My e-mail address is santori1_at_cs_dot_com
Thank You.
Matthew Santori
