if we call you names like in the school yard will you keep it :)

my 79 lost #1 cyl exhaust valve on my first trip to Everybus. Not only
did I make it to EB (another 200 miles) but managed to drive back home
(500 miles) and to/from work (42 miles each way) for many weeks before
I got a weekend free to drop the engine and do a head swap. These type
4 engines are very robust and stout. While you have to stay on your
toes to keep them in tip/top shape actually killing them can take some
work. At least at 80lbs the cyl isn't completely dead. It may let you
down tomorrow, but the odds are you can drive it for quite a while in
this state. The biggest downside of this attitude is the possible
additional damage of a poorly running engine. I'd say run it, get that
104 year house ready for winter, and early spring get to fixing that
bus. ;)
