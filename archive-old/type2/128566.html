VENTURA, Calif. (AP) - A car-carrier loaded with vintage Porsches was struck
by a freight train Sunday after becoming stranded on railroad tracks,
officials said. 
The accident occurred about 3:45 p.m. near the Ventura County Fairgrounds,
said Lt. David Wilson of the Ventura Police Department, who was at the
scene. 
     The car-carrier was &quot;high-centered&quot; on the railroad tracks and the
driver was trying to maneuver it off the tracks when Wilson arrived. Wilson
said he called to have train traffic stopped, but a northbound freight train
came barreling down the track only moments later. &quot;We were able to get the
driver out of the cab, luckily,&quot; Wilson said. The driver suffered minor
injuries while fleeing from the impact, Wilson said. 
The vintage Porsches &quot;are close to totaled, if not totaled,&quot; Wilson said.
&quot;The train center-punched the trailer carrying the cars and split the
trailer in half, and the cars went flying,&quot; he said. No crew members on the
train were injured, but the front wheels of the locomotive derailed, said
John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific. Debris was being removed from
under the locomotive late Sunday night and there was no estimate on when the
tracks would be cleared, Bromley said.
