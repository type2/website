I would disagree with stopping for 10 minutes to cool the bus, it wont
work.

When you turn of the motor, the fan stops and the engins sits and soaks in
heat, it really has to be off for a much longer time than 10 minutes to
cool down appreciably.

I'd say that unless you are driving in really hilly conditions, driving
slower for a while will do more to cool it down than stopping tee engine
for 5 minutes.

take care,

p.s. i am often wrong, correct me if i stuck my foot in my mouth again!
