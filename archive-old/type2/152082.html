Subject: Re: [T2] front seat discomfort

&gt; The time has come for me to finally do something about my front seats.  I
&gt; think the springs are pretty shot, so I don't know if replacing the pads
&gt; is the way to go or not.  What options are there for replacing them
&gt; altogether?  Are the springs likely OK and the pads the issue?  What have
&gt; others done in similar situations?

with my 78 the seats were beyond bad, so when a nice set of Vanagon seats
became avaliable at a great price I grabbed em, haven't regretted it,
