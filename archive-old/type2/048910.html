Subject: [T2] Need a couple of used parts (light and alt bracket)

Would anyone have a spare rear side light fixture (the whole thing - fixture
and lens) for a 73 Bus (passenger side, if it matters)?
I also need the bracket to allow tightening the alternator fan belt on a
Type IV engine (1800cc).  Mine is busted.
Also, the round wire mesh guard that fits over the fan on the Type IV
(1800cc) engine.
Thanks.
