Subject: Air Horn

&quot;When I need a horn, I just poke it out the
driver window and trigger the briefest  blast that can be managed....sort
of a bleeep.  Don't know if such equipment meets the legal requirement for
Ohio, but that is what I am doing.&quot;

That is freaking awesome. I have one of those horns on my boat that can be
refilled with air from a compressor. I think it would be much more
effective than the electric anyway! Thanks for the tip.

&quot;I probably toot that air horn once or twice each year. This is not one of
those occassions.&quot;

I think I'll be using mine a bit more often, but then thats just the kind
of jerk I am...
