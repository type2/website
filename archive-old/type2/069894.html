Subject: Re: NO CINDERBLOCKS!

I agree with Bill Abbot on NOT using Cinder Blocks......for jackstands

I may have said &quot;cinder blocks&quot;??? in my post re working on 78 Wresty;
actually I use CONCRETE Blocks, the solid kind (4X4X8) or full size CAP
Corner BLOCKS- solid on one side, three holes in the other- use them flat
and with a layer of plywood at the top to prevent weight pressure on just
one point.
