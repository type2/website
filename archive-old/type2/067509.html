Subject: my clock

Alright.  I'm ready to start asking about my clock now.  It's broken.  I
have no idea if it is fixable or if I need a new one, but I just so loved
having a working clock and I can't stand digital ones, especially in a '78
Bus, that I really really want to have it working.  I am planning on
spending whatever money I get for Christmas (hopefully it will be enough)
on my car, and this is one of my utmost priorities.  I know it seems dumb,
but I think it is going to be the biggest change I can get for the money I
spend on it.  Please someone tell me I'm right.  So does anyone know how to
fix a clock?  Can I take it out and take it to a clock store?  Is it
hopeless?  I know that clocks are really hard to find, especially working
ones.  I'm just glad I have one, but I think I want it to work.

Also- does anyone have any clues about preventing my emergency brake cable
and my speedometer cable from freezing this winter?  I'm still not positive
I'm going to have a garage, but I don't think it will help much even if I
do.  Atleast keep the snow out of the engine compartment, but I'd like a
working brake and speedometer this winter, unlike last winter...
