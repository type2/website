type2_at_type2_dot_com

I was going over what spare parts to keep in my bus, and debating how
much room i was willing to give up, and what tools i would need and i
thought, well what's most likely to break on a bus? What leaves people
stranded more then other things.

So i ask everyone on the list that has ever had a bus break down on them
to send me a report so i can chart what parts and problems that leave
people stranded, what will be most helpful to have along, and what could
have been done to prevent the breakdown. I will report my results when I
get enough reports to have some real information. 

I set up a different email address so these will be easily sorted, so please
send your breakdown report to: brokenbus_at_zendo_dot_net
(and not to the list)

Please include:

Year of bus:
Miles on bus, or a guess:
Condition of bus (rust bucket to show winner):

If motor related,
type of motor:
year of motor:
size of motor:
miles on motor:
any modifications to motor:

If transmission related,
all the same info about the transmission

Any other relevant info.

You can always include multi-poll reports in the same email, and if for the
same bus you don't have to repeat the info.

And of course include what broke, how, when, what did you do to get back
on the road, and tools you used to fix it, or was it towed, did it have to
goto a vw specific mechanic or did the guy at Amoco fix it. Also please be
brief, not looking for stories just how and why. I hope to get as many
reply as possible. I want to know everything from a window that wouldn't
roll up to flat tires to dropped valves.


Thanks

eli

PPS, Feel free to post this on the type2 web site, or any web site, the
