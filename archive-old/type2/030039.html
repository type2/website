&gt; &gt; Ok that was cheep.  But funny.
&gt; 
&gt; LOL, cheap, but very funny. I think it might be a case of &quot;do as I
&gt; say, not as I do&quot; 8-)

Nope :-)  Well, OK, sort-of, but it is more &quot;apples and oranges&quot; than &quot;do
as I say&quot;.  If Thom Fitzpatrick had asked my advice when he bought that
RHD deluxe Barndoor, my answer would have been very different than that to
someone who walks up to me on the street or at a campout and expresses
interest.  The rants were what I would tell someone walking in the door,
not what I would tell an old hand at VW restoration/maintainance.  

The '67 is an illogical &quot;mid-life crisis&quot;, there is no question about
that! :-) John regularly sends me notice of better buses out west for lots
less than I have budgetted for the body work on the '67.  I *know* that if
I took $5-7K out to AZ/CA, I would come back with a mighty fine bus.  The
thing is, tho, that if I don't save this one, it will go to the crusher
and while it is no prize in the &quot;dry&quot; category, it is too nice for that.

&gt; John Henry webmaster of http://www.geocities_dot_com/thebugshop writes
&gt; that you should buy solid, complete, correct and original. 

And the '67 is actually 3 of 4 there... solid is all it's missing and I am
working on that (OK, *Kelly* is working on that :-)

&gt; A excellent article for anyone thinking about buying any old veedub.

Indeed it is!  written for beetles, but the same considerations apply to
buses.
