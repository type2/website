&gt; I recently acquired a 78. The case is a GE, which my reading tells me is the

GE just means it was a case that originally had hydraulic lifters on 78-79
models (both federal and CA).

&gt; There doesn't appear to be a tremendous amount of usage,
&gt; but that oil mist is a mess for those behind me, and the rear hatch of my
&gt; bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions...
&gt; Where is the oil coming from that blows up the rear hatch?  (not out of the
&gt; exhaust, I have checked)
&gt; 
&gt; Where do I begin to look and clean this rascal up
&gt; 
&gt; What causes so much blow by.

Valve cover and push rod tube leaks can make that kind of mess.
