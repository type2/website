Subject: Re: [T2] Water Injection

&gt;As I understand it, compressed natural gas (CNG) has an octane rating of about
&gt;130.

	correct  -  New Zealand largely pioneered CNG, from the late 
1970s  -  but you don't need those octanes if you have WI.  I cannot 
provoke knocking with 13:1 CR on petrol, given good WI.  There is not 
much further return from raising CR above that.


&gt;  It seems that a turbocharged 2800+cc Type 4 engine with, say, a 14.5:1
&gt;compression ratio, running CNG and water-injection would be pretty hard to
&gt;beat.

	exactly  -  done on a racing Datsun 260Z here in Auckland, 
with some help from U of Auckland engin'g sch.


&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine who has a VW shop in Texas won some major national sand drag
&gt;races running a sand dragster with a supercharged 2400+ cc VW Type I motor,
&gt;using methanol as the fuel. The V8 Chevy guys really resented the fact that a
&gt;VW-powered dragster was kicking their butts. Seems like CNG (which is
&gt;primarily methane) would a be a simpler and better fuel to use than methanol
&gt;or propane.

	1.  Propane is not much different in any way from CNG, once 
you get it in the vehicle.  (It is much more dangerous in bulk 
distribution.)

	2.  Methanol is considerably different  -  octane rating also 
well above 100, tho' as I say you don't need that if you use WI. 
Our Kiwi hero Munro used methanol  -  do see 'The World's Fastest 
Indian', tho' it omits most of the evidence that he was a genius.

	3.  Methanol is a good fuel, but can be difficult.  It 
dissolves the 'terne metail ' lining of most petrol tanks  -  and 
dissolves quite a few types of flexible hose used in petrol systems 
within vehicles. We have the world's biggest methanol factory, and 
can't export to the previous main user (conversion to the petrol 
additive MTBE in Calif), but are not contemplating creation of a MeOH 
distribution system within NZ.
