Subject: the engine is in!

A great big Thank You to Mark, Britt, Karl, Bob, and others who 
pointed out that my use of an earlier style clutch pressure plate was 
preventing me from moving a 1600 engine into my '71 Westy.  I put the 
correct plate on and the engine slid in like a hot knife through 
butter.

How did anyone get along without this list!

Jack
