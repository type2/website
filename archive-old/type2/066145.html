Does JC Whitney have an e-mail address?  Has anyone else had any problems 
with these people or am I the lucky one?  I ordered a part in _JUNE_ that 
I have paid for with my credit card and they said it was backordered.  So 
I politely wait for a while, get really mad, call, they say &quot;oops&quot;.  
Still nothing.  I call again, they say &quot;it has been off back order for 
weeks. We'll send it express Monday&quot;  That was a week and a half ago.  
Nothing.  I'm getting really annoyed.
