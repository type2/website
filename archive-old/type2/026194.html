	I also won't make the mistake of buying anything from Bugformance in
Sunnyvale.  There's a Bugformance in San Jose, CA, that isn't affiliated
with the shop in Sunnyvale, and I'll continue to buy stuff from the San Jose
shop.

I guess everyone eventually comes to the same conclusion about that
particular store.  I've been buying from Peninsula Automotive
(www.peninsulaautomotive_dot_com) for many years now since having the same
experience with Sunnyvale Bugformance.  Coincidentally it was also an engine
for a '71 Bus.

	So, the bottom line is, does anyone out there have a doghouse fan
shroud that will fit a 71 bus with 1600 DP?  Original, not aftermarket?
With mounting holes for the thermostat flaps and coil?

Check with some of the other VW repair shops in the area -- I can think of
half a dozen.  Or, make a round of the local Pick-N-Pulls.  That's where I
got my doghouse parts.
