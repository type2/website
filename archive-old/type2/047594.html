Subject: FW: [T2] Octane

&gt;Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Volkswagens- all HIGHLY recommend
&gt;using the &quot;Premium&quot; gasoline aka 93 Octane here in the USA.

That would be true for the high performance models. I guess that in the US
only these are available.
And here you are talking about cars that will top 125 mph or more and reach
60 in 8 seconds or so.
The 'average' European car is not a BMW, more like a VW Golf, Opel Astra
(GM), Fiat or Renault.
