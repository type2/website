Subject: Re: [T2] New Internet GPS Tracking &amp; Security System

Amateur radio folk have been using the tracking part of this system for a
number of year now.  It's called APRS.  See:

http://www.aprs_dot_net/usa1.html

for an example.

We don't control the vehicles, though.  We just watch where they are.
