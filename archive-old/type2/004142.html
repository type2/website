&gt;&gt;The answer Joe is fairly simple - increased exhaust emissions.
&gt;
&gt;Don't you mean REDUCED exhaust emissions?  Could you please explain how
&gt;smaller intake valve size achieves this?


Probably he does.

&gt;&gt;All auto manufacturers were doing the low-tech emissions compliance
&gt;&gt;dance in the '70s (VW still doesn't have a 4-valve/cylinder in anything
&gt;&gt;other than the GTI -
&gt;
&gt;Again, how does 4 valves per cylinder help emissions?


All these have to do with the same thing basically increased port velocity.
There are always massive tradeoffs flowwise between port size and speed.
Basically just hogging it out big as you can becomes defeating after a point
because the mass flow goes back down as the speed sinks.  Now once upon a
time 10 years back after a couple fluid dynamics classes I could have given
exact reasons, now they fortunately escape me but basically there is no
doubt high velocity occurs at restricitions.  4 valve heads and now in fact
VW/Audi 5 valvers have always been for this reason something about increased
efficiency by getting the charge in and out as fast as possible, probably so
there can be less overlap and less stuff going out unburnt would be my
instantaneous guess.  I recall an excellent article in EC some years back
about one of the top Porsche tuners, Precision I think only wanting 911
castings from certain years with smaller ports because polishing them up
gave better power results than from years with larger ones.  It is
interesting to note that the T3's did not show the same trend in decreased
valve size with FI from VW but they had to meet less stringent standards
perhaps in 1971?  And there is no real doubt the Japs were always at the
forefront of this, Honda of course, Toyota, have long had exotic 12V and 16V
designs, Nissan and Mitsubishi had rock solid 8V's but with hemi combustion
chambers and DOHC, hell Nissan was even running twin plugs in the 80's,
Mitsubishi had these cute little angled 1/2&quot; valves to initiate a swirl in
the chamber to lower emissions with carbs of frightening complexity.  VW's
16V was a design abomination, not particularly a great perfomer, and is in
my mind generally an engine to be avoided.  Todays crossflow 8V 2.0 is
significantly more powerful than even the 2.0 16V was where it counts, up to
3500 rpm or so.  Now the 5V is an engineering marvel but I tend to just read
that as repair nightmare.  Let this all wane from true Bus content, frankly
it doesn't much apply, the stock 2.0 stuff is probably too small for even
mild performance enhancements, and it might be noted that on the square port
heads from '79 on intake size went back up again, though those damn tiny
exhaust valves are still there.
