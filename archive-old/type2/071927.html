No, roughly 20k on 1 set, 15k on another set, and 55k on the latest set.
Went from set 1 to set 2 because of a blown spark plug helicoil that was
pretty much un-repairable, and set 2 to 3 because I was rebuilding the
engine and set 2 was an unknown set of 1700 heads that I got from the
junkyard.  Come to think of it, the very first set of heads I had on the
bus experienced a catastrophic failure (exhaust valve snapped in two) but I
had the EGR *connected* when that happened.  Go figure?
