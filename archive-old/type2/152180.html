&gt; A couple weeks ago the GWB died. Symptoms are: will start and idle for a
&gt; while, but has no power to move the bus. It revs well, no backfiring or
&gt; popping.
&gt;
&gt; Things done and made no improvement:

long list deleted

have you checked/replaced coil
have you checked that ALL electric connections are tight, mine did this
once took forever to track it down to a bad connector on the coil.


what year is the GWB
