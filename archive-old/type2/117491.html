&gt; I have anoher question on the same subject. I have hydro lifters and just
&gt; recently ordered new pushrods/pushrod tubes. Is there a difference between
&gt; hydrolic lifter pushrods/tubes and solid lifter pushrods/tubes. If there
&gt; is a difference i could be in trouble because I did not specify that I
&gt; need hydrolic pushrods/tubes to match my lifters.

the tubes are the same but the pushrods are different and NOT
interchangable
