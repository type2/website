&gt;MX-449 - Install home evap.cooler inside bus. (JBB)
&gt;MX-1000 - Install chevy mid engine v-8/ford rearend (available only
&gt;67` only westfailures) (JBB)

In case anyone was wondering where these two came from, they were both at
Jerome.  The bus with MX-449 also had a 2.3L Ford engine in it that stuck
out past the rear sheet metal of the bus.  The MX-1000 bus also had the
MX-2493 limo option: 6 ft stretch with double-double side doors.
