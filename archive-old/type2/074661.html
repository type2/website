Subject: [T2] Electric Fuel Pump Relay

Would also install a 'bypass' switch to operate the pump on demand. Maybe a
momentary pushbutton.

&gt; &gt; Sounds like it would work like you want it and as a nice added bonus
feature
&gt; &gt; it would automatically kill the engine when the oil pressure light comes
on.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone tried running a hot lead to the relay coil, then grounding the
&gt; &gt; other
&gt; &gt; &gt; side through the oil sending switch? Seems to me that would do the
job,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'd also be curious if the switch could handle..oh wait. you were going to
&gt; ground the /relay/ trigger through the switch....ok.  that should work
&gt; fine...
