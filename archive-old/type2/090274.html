Subject: Re: [T2] North Carolina to Texas?

Hi, thanks for the reply and info. The guy I'm buying it from isn't
interested in helping with the shipping and I agreed to that when I
bought it. I just thought I might get lucky and find a VW bus driver
headed this way, otherwise I'll just use this as a good excuse to go to
the High Country Bus Festival : ) Thanks, Chris

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I can't help with the transport except to say that more than one 
&gt; rack 
&gt; has been transported on a Greyhound bus. As for scratching do not 
&gt; worry about it.  For the feet in the rain gutter  simply slit some 
&gt; fuel like and make socks for the feet. The clamps can be dipped in 
&gt; tool dip to rubberize the ends and eliminate scratches. Also not 
&gt; that 
&gt; baywindow racks are about an inch wider at the feet than splitty 
&gt; racks.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
