Subject: Re: [T2] Start Problem

I had a problem just like this about 6 months ago. The
car would get gas while the starter was cranking, run
for a few seconds and die.

The problem turned out to be a bad surface on the
points inside the double relay. One of the relays is
used to switch the pump power from start (work when
the starter is running) to normal running (when the
AFM is letting air through). 

What I did at the time is strongly recommended
AGAINST. I was stuck on the side of the road, so I ran
some speaker wire from the + side of the coil to the
pump. Worked wonders, but now the pump won't shut off
if the engine dies. If you crash, you could have fuel
pumping everywhere if you don't shut off the ignition.

I fixed the problem by grinding down the points, but
I'll have to get a new double relay at some point...

&gt; aircooled 2.0 litre.  One day a while back it
&gt; wouldn't start.  It would only fire for a second or
three then die.
