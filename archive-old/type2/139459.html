Subject: Re: [T2] Case sealing methods

Okay, I ordered this Loktite stuff from Pelikan (sorry, Scott). It 
should be here on Thursday. I ordered it because you were the most 
adamant and persistent list member. Also because if I didn't and my 
case were to happen to leak, you would have perfect &quot;I told you so&quot; 
rights. Well, you and Scott Lyons.

So this whole rebuild is now riding on your shoulders. If this engine 
leaks, for any reason, you better load that big-*ss tool case in your 
bus and come out here and make it right.

;-)
