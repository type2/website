 Re: front triangular window


Easy to replace:
Remove door panel.
Roll window down.
Remove 2 bolts at bottom of window, let window drop all the way down.
Up in the corner, pull down window channel that is along the top of window 
opening.
Remove phillips head screw that is up in channel. Take a straight blade 
screwdriver and bend the tab down a little.
Look below the pivot point for a 10mm headed bolt inside a hole. 
Remove the bolt.
Pull window frame out at top and then roll it out of the bottom.
