Subject: Re: [T2] help- my engine is making a popping noise

&gt;The engine idles fine, but when you rev it, there is a popping noise. It
&gt;doesn't disappear when you pull any of the plugs. Hydraulic lifters are
&gt;adjusted at 2 turns. Compression is good. Pulled a couple lifters and there is
&gt;a bit of scoring on the surface, and they don't push in as others do- they are
&gt;completely stiff. Could this cause popping?
&gt;
My vote is also exhaust.  I thought I'd throw in my two cents since my 
exhaust is just about down the crapper and I'm experience what seems to 
be exactly what you're describring.  Your motor can be great - good 
compression, well tuned, good on idle, etc.but at higher RPMs it'll 
sound like somebody is cooking up popcorn in the back of your bus. 
 First make sure there is nobody cooking popcorn then check for exhaust 
leaks.

On mine I can just cover the tail pipe with a rag (don't stuff it in 
there and don't burn yourself either) and feel along the exhaust line 
for leaks (not touching the pipes just feeling for air of course).  And 
you must get it fixed before it causes long term damage.  And by all 
means go camping.
