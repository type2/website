Subject: Re: [T2] Bay window door lock syndrome

I'm not a locksmith, just fixing my own bus. That is one aggravating 
problem. I wonder how many people actually scrapped bay buses because of it, 
I'll bet it is more than one.
Spraying whole tanks of lube will not fix the problem, I tried that too.
The coil spring is the thing! Get it while the VW dealer still has them.
My wife used about 10 little delicate tools to coax that sucker onto the 
prongs where it lives, it can be done.

&lt;A locksmith (which one are you?) at HCBF showed me this trick- if it's
hard to use the key to unlock the door after the button was pushed down,
unscrew the upper large phillips screw holding the latch on the door
side edge.  Stick the extender nozzle of a silicone spray lube into this
hole and aim down as you spray and push -pull the knob and turn the key.
Worked for us.&gt;
