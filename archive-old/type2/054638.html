Subject: 1970 Engine Question

Hello All,
I've got a question regarding placing an 1835cc engine in a 70 westy. 
Pat Flynn (fellow listee) posted a 70 with no engine.  I have a friend
who currently has an 1835cc engine available.  I am interested in
Patricks bus, however, I was wondering if the 1835cc engine would cause
a problem.  I know that the vents in the rear were made larger in later
models to accomodate for the 1700 and 1800cc engines.  Would engine
cooling be a problem with a 70 body style?  I'am assuming that the
engine would even work in a 70.  Am I wrong about that?

Its good to be back.  I've been away for about a month.  Thanks again!

Jason
