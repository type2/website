&gt; My question is: Is the number of plies the TOTAL (ie- 2 poly

&gt; I was under the impression that when we spoke about the number of
plies,
&gt; it was the sidewall plies.
&gt; This tire only has 2 sidewall plies.

Counting plies became obsolete when synthetic fibers replaced cotton
as the ply material!

Most customers were comfortable with the idea of counting plies to
determine how strong a tire was, so the manufacturers came up with the
concept of &quot;ply rating&quot; which is a measure of how many plies an
equally strong cotton ply tire would have.  This allowed them to sell
tires with fewer plies of that newfangled rayon stuff.

These days, we rely more on load range ratings, but even these can be
deceptive, as they vary unpredictably with the size and section height
of a tire.  You can end up with a larger tire of identical load range
that has lower capacity than a narrower tire.

The best indicator of a tire's carrying capacity is the fine print on
the sidewall.  Here you will find the tire's true capacity in pounds
and kilograms.  Buses like tire with 1540 pounds of capacity or more.
