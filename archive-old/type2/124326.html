Subject: RE: [T2] Windshield replacement in N. Virginia

&gt; I certainly would if I still lived there! (Vienna), but. I 
&gt; don't. However, the job is fairly simple, just remember not 
&gt; to &quot;FORCE&quot; anything.


It also helps to leave the new seal out in the sun for a few hours
before you install it, to make it more pliable and easier to work with.
