Subject: Re: [T2] Cantrell's tome on aux battery and relay

I guess I should chime in here a bit.

Please remember that even when the main batt is to
drained to start it, it still has lots of power
remaining.  The voltage is too low to make sufficent
RPMS to start, but I can tell you from experience that
if you mistakenly short out a car battery in this
state, you are taking your life in your hands.

Personnaly, Ive started by 78 westy by just connecting
the two lug terminals on the relay together.

The trick is (even with a stone dead main battery) to
let the charge flow for several minutes without the key
in the ignition.  The main battery will suck up the
charge of the AUX at what ever rate it can through the
small wire and piddly connections until the voltage is
equalized.  Leave the connection in place while
starting and recharging (that what it does anyway once
it starts) 

Of course right now I'm between AUX batts, so I park on
slight hills, just in case :)
