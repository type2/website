Hello list,

I have a quick carb question.

On my 74 automatic bus, which carb setup would be
better, the stock dual 32/34 pict SOLEX carbs or a
32/36 deav Weber carb. Both setups need some work and
I don't know which set up would be better. Any
suggestions would be great!

Thanks,

David Kelly from Wilmington, North Carolina
