Ok, I have searched the archives and cannot find the info I need.  The PO
stripped oil drain plug hole on my '77 bus.  The plug is ok, but it just
spins and never really tightens.  I have not been able to find out what the
threading of the bolt/hole is.  Can anyone tell me what the thread is.  The
local FLAPS has some self tapping oil drain bolts that I mat want to try.

Thanks,
