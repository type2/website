Just wanted to say that the new digest format - as of 29 March - is
wonderful from here.   Much better than previous.  THANKS.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

I totally disagree. It requires a lot of mouse clicking to read all the
attachments.  Also, I think that back in January the consesus was that most
people preferred the single message format.

Was this change deliberate or a side effect of the transitions the server is
going through?
