Subject: pulling steering wheel

Nikki,

Good luck! That's a highly specialized tool you seek. I too, (as well
as many others, I'm sure) would like to have one. Not only have I
never even seen one, but I've never met anyone who has.

Maybe someone (Bus Boys, Bus Depot) could design/fab/sell us
something???

At any rate, you need to remove your steering wheel now. Here's what
I've done:

1-Loosen the big nut on the steering column that tightens the steering
wheel down. 

2-Spray a VERY liberal amount of anti-seize on the shaft. Let it sit
for a day if possible (tighten the nut back up if you drive it!!!). 

3-Back the nut off HALFWAY.
 
4-Disconnect the horn wire and tuck it into hole in the shaft it comes
up through to protect it from step 5!!!

5-While you pull up on the steering wheel with all of your might (I'm
NOT kidding here), have someone deliver several quick blows to the top
of the steering column with a 5lb sledge-hammer(if you don't have a
5lb sledge, it's time to buy or borrow, as a regular hammer won't cut
it). Hit it directly on the top so that the threads don't get
bunged-up. If they do, don't worry, simply back the nut off and it
should straighten them out. The main reason you leave the nut on is to
prevent you from launching your head through the roof when the wheel
FINALLY comes loose!!


I know this sounds truly monkey-assed, but it works and I was taught
by a *real* mechanic who's done it countless times. I've done it
several times since, with no problem. 

Also, after you get the wheel off, put some anti-seize grease on the
shaft, it'll make it easier the next time you have to remove it. I
found out the hard way that it will re-sieze after only a couple of
days:-(

One last bit of advice, if someone says you can use a gear-puller,
DON'T BELIEVE THEM!!!! It will only break the bakelite and you STILL
won't get the wheel off!
