Subject: RE: [T2] Got the 'cant get the new engine to work right' Blues

&gt; Set my timing with a light while running, no vacumn lines.  set it to 7.5
&gt;
&gt; Is the timing more a function of the disti, or the engine?  The disti lookup
&gt; says 7.5 BTDC for my disti, my friend with the same type of engine says TDC,
&gt; and my father says &quot;just do it by ear&quot;
&gt;

What was the maximum advance?
