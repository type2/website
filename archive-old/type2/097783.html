Subject: Ospho on a rusty exhaust?

Hey all,

I have one of those Empi Dual Muffler exhausts that rust really quick when 
the black paint burns off. It is the 72-74-ca79 style with the dual outlets 
on each heater box.

A friend of mine told me to sand the rusty muffler down a bit, and apply 
Ospho, and that that should keep it ok till I can get a new one. I know that 
it will condensate on the inside, so It wouldn't really work forever, but do 
ya'll think that Ospho is ok to use on the exhaust? Will it burn up, or 
anything undesirable like that?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Chris
