&gt; Allow me to elaborate on the merits of the Wasserleaker.

No disagreement with you at all on wasserboxer vs air-cooled.

My comment was more about wasserboxer vs VW's inline liquid-cooled 
engines of the same vintage.

Let me restate my question... Premise: The diesel Vanagon engine was 
the same as the diesel Rabbit engine, yes?  So, if they were able to 
get that engine into the Vanagon, why did they bother with the 
wasserboxer then they had an inline gasoline engine for the Rabbit 
already that surely would have also fit the Vanagon?

(Hm, maybe we're getting away from Bus content... :-)
