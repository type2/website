Subject: Re: [T2] How hot is HOT?

When you overheat too far then the pressed in valve seats begin to come 
loose and you 'drop a valve seat'.

You are running way hot in my opinion. I have never run more that 375 
degrees under ANY condition --- and that includes towing a Hyundai Excel 
from Norfolk to Chattanooga with a Beetle (Type IV powered).

I would pull the VDO sender out and dip it into a pot of boiling water 
(don't touch the sides of the container) and see what temp it reports --- 
212? Then it is right one and your engine is in fact running hot.



&gt;New VW bus owner here... Just put in a VDO cylinder temperature sensor and
&gt;it works great.  I just can't find any information on &quot;How hot is HOT?&quot;  I
&gt;did see an advertisement for another cylinder head sensor that shuts off the
&gt;engine when it reaches 425F.  I've gotten it up to 450F and everything seems
&gt;fine.  This particular sensor goes all the way up to 600F with no red zone.

The gauge is a generic one that is used for many applications so they can't 
specify a red zone because what is too hot for one application may not be 
too hot for another.
