Importance: Normal

First, let me say that I am happy and surprised at the out-pouring of
financial help. You all are digging deep and with everyone's continuing
efforts the list will survive.

Second, the money. We have received $1284.68 (after bank fees of $10.44) as
of 06/07/01. We have enough for the hardware we need and the admin's are
busy getting that end together.

THIRD- SEND MONEY......  I would like to get a 6 month cushion for ISP fees
so that our service will never be interrupted while we have a frantic
fundraiser. Don't forget that, in addition to the valuable technical advice,
travel &amp; event reports, part information, etc.,the list is home of AIRS,
which can be a life-saver for summer travelers.

Donations should be sent to:

             Type2 Fundraiser

		Cincinnati, Oh. 45215
		1-877-517-4811 (toll-free for any questions or information)
		tedebare_at_one_dot_net (for pay-pal)

Lets keep up the good work.... TBear
