Subject: space heaters

Thanks for all of the information about space heaters. Much appreciated.

On Jamie Rivers recommendation, I went to look at the Caframo 9200. 
Some of the heaters I had looked at at Wal-Mart seemed just a bit on 
the shoddy side. The Caframo is very well put together, and it also has 
a five year warranty. I liked its low center of gravity. I also liked 
the fact that the exterior case does not get hot... which hopefully 
will prevent it from igniting our dog in the middle of the night. It 
was $49.00 at Boat USA. A bit more expensive than the Wal-Mart models, 
but probably those didn't have five year warranties.

I tried it out last night with the top up. It has 600 W, 900 W and 1500 
W settings.  The outside temperature was 42 degrees F, and 1500 W 
setting warmed the inside up pretty quickly. I then turned it down to 
the 600 W setting. When I checked again after half an hour the 
temperature had dropped only a few degrees. Probably with three people 
and the dog inside, the lowest setting would have sufficed to maintain 
the temperature.

The dimensions are 11 1/4&quot; W X 8&quot; D X 5&quot; H. It fits very nicely on the 
floor beneath the fold down bed, where it can blow out into the central 
floor area but still be out of the way of feet. All in all, it seems 
like its going to work out very nicely.

Sent my wheels out for powder coating Saturday. Will be giving 
tirerack_dot_com some business shortly.
