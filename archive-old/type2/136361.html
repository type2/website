Subject: RE: [T2] Help BusDepot Donate to Tsunami Victims

Ron, I've just added up my order I've been &quot;waiting&quot; to place and it's $1600.  I'm going to place it now in light of what you're doing.  Nice job, I don't know many for-profit privately-owned businesses that would do what you're doing!
-Chris in So-Cal

&gt;So from now until New Years, 25 percent of the net profits of BusDepot_dot_com
&gt;sales will be donated to Doctors Without Borders, to provide medical relief
&gt;for the victims of this tragedy.
