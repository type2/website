Subject: Re: injector timing query

&gt;Quoting Sean:
&gt;&gt;They are supposed to receive 12v constantly all the time the ignition 
is
&gt;on.  When they are to be fired, the ECU grounds them.
&gt;&gt;Since all the injectors are grounded (fired) at the same time, it is
&gt;perfectly OK to swap the plugs.
&gt;
&gt;?? Hmmm...yues I've read that somewhere...BUT  the distributor points 
make
&gt;contact at the right time, sending the primary voltage to the coil (and 
to
&gt;the ECU input.)   The rotor determines which spark plug gets the 
secondary
&gt;current.  I'd think the injector has to fire it's gas into the incoming 
air
&gt;timed  to compression in its cylinder.   

You'd think so, but it doesn't work out that way.  In fact, the 
injectors all fire simultaneously and they fire once per crankshaft 
revolution.  Additionally, half the total amount of fuel needed for one 
firing of a cylinder is injected in each injection.  (This info comes 
from the Bosch FI book by Probst.)

But since the brain only gets a
&gt;signal when the points close due to distrib. cam action, how does the 
ECU
&gt;know which cylinder injector to ground?  

It doesn't, which is why it grounds them all at once :-)  -- the signal 
from the coil to the ECU is basically just an rpm signal to let the ECU 
know how often to trigger the injectors (once per crankshaft revolution)

 Since the fuel ring is under
&gt;pressure and the injectors fire gas at each grounding, wouldn't
&gt;simultaneous injection waste gas???
&gt;                                        
Apparently not...I think that even at 900 rpm (idle) things are moving 
fast enough in there that grounding all the injectors simultaneously 
doesn't cause any problems as far as fuel delivery goes.  It must not, 
the thing works :-)
