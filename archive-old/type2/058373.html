Subject: Itty-Bitty Rubber mat thingie...

Folks:

I am about to subject Brunhilda, my '73 Westy, to arpit surgury, i.e., I am replaceing the
rusted out front wheel arch panels.  Two questions:  First:  Does anyone know whether or
not it it possible to get replacement conformal rubber matting for the seat pedistals of
my '73 Westie?  I have looked at lots of rubber replacement catalogs, and no one seems to
carry them.  Maybe they are available in Brazilian or Mexican?   Second:    Ditto on the
little rubber foot mat that lives down in the step in the front wheel arch which is
covered by the drivers-side door.
