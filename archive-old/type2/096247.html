&gt; &lt;&lt; Went to a small VW carshow in Gatlinburg, TN one year. saw a GT-40 (I 
&gt; think) kit car built on a VW pan. It had MUCH HP and I think it may have 
&gt; even had a Corvair or Porsche 6 cylinder - I really can't remember.
&gt;  &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Sure it was a GT-40 ? The Laser 917 (Similar front but much higher
&gt; upswept tail) used a VW pan. BTW, the rumor mill has Ford bringing
&gt; back a retro GT-40 to go with the T-Bird and the &quot;49er&quot;...

very possibly the Fibrefab, Avenger GT-12,  a mini version of the GT-40
and it was built on a VW chasis, I had one although mine was built on a
custom square steel tube chassis.  it was an awsome handling vehicle, but
couldn't seem to get rid of the blue/red lights in the rearview mirror.
