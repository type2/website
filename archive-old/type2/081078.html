Subject: Fw: [T2] exhaust fumes in cab

YEP!

Don't compromise.

(If it's smoke - it could be burning oil instead - I've had this but it soon

I have a 1970 type 2 bog standard
I recently fitted new heater hoses in the engine compartment the old ones
wer missing
I now have exhaust fumes coming into the van
Does this mean I have a shot heat exchanger?
