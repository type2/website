VW sold their vans in Europe and Mexico as work horses, but in 
North America there didn't seem to be much of a demand. What are your 
sightings, current and past? Besides the old Rent-a-Volks, there were a 
few used locally.

In the early 70's, a &quot;resort&quot; was set up on the Oregon coast (the Inn at 
Spanish Head?). Each condo unit sat on the edge of a cliff, with a 
restaurant down hill, accessable via a combo elevator/trolley. The most 
unique feature was each unit had a large porch on its land side. After 
checking in, all your luggage was loaded into a Loaf, and you were 
driven to your room. The covered porch formed the roadway. It's been 20 
years since I stayed there, so I wonder what they are using today.

A local nursery grows many of their own plants, and has to move tons 
more in and out of the greenhouses. Amoung other vehicles, they still 
use a 50s model (?) single cab. I think it seldom gets into 2nd, much 
less 3rd. I haven't seen it this year, but it was active last year at 
this time. It's still all original, even down to the paint.

An Eastern Oregon &quot;dude&quot; ranch tried using (abusing?) VW vans. The sides 
and top were cut out of splitties, and the top remounted on poles. Sides 
of canvas were installed. The sides rolled up in warm weather. I think 
the company went out of business after a couple years.
