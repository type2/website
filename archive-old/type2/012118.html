I cleaned my basement this weekend and took inventory

longer need.  Here is what I have and prices, these
are all more than reasonable, just add shipping and
you can have before the holidays.

Blue/Green plaid 74/75 Wesfalia material, from upper
cot, enough to re do the front seats $20 (super nice)

2 brand new back cushion for front seats from RMMW's
$7 a peice
1 bottom cushion font seats, brnad new from RMMW's $7

Westfalia small table and leg, leg is missing a piece
for connection, push button.  This is for a 74-79. 
For 74-75 can also be used between sink &amp; Fridge $15

1970 Upper cot a little dirty but strong and complete
$15 ( will just tape a label on and ship US mail, have
had success in the past.

2 botton cot poles from a 75 $5 (Same shipping
arrangement as other cot stuff)

1975 wiper assembly complete w/motor.  Should be good,
can't be sure $15, was my spare for a long time

might just have it.
