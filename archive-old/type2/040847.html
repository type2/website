Subject: It is Friday so......

I have been on the list for over a year since I purchased &quot;Erfolkswagen&quot; and 
brought it home on a trailer. I have usually restricted posting to the list 
until I have checked my manuals: Bentley, Haynes, Muir, etc., and tried all 
the possibilities myself. Just this once, and following an earlier post, I 
just want to say thanks to everyone on the list for being here when I needed 
you whether you replied or not. I now have an '80 Vanagon pop-top Westfalia 
that I am just learning about. I have its Bentley (heavy reading!) and the 
Haynes is on the way. I have a '69 and 77 buses for spare parts. Do I qualify 
as hooked? 
Sunday I will stop by Pomona, CA for the VW/car show/swap and look for 
goodies and then go home to try and solve an apparently hot-running problem 
in the '80. I will have a name badge on at Pomona with &quot;Type2_dot_com&quot; on it. 
Maybe we can meet and talk VWs.
I too have been in the J**P community (in the '60s/'70s) and they were much 
like the VW community of today. I am on the A. I. R. S.  list if anyone is 
ever in my neighborhood and needs help or just wants to stop by.
I would love to comment on the Mojave Phone Booth but don't want to start a 
thread but I saw that booth 25 years ago and it had a special place in my 
heart. 
Thanks again to all, I am looking forward to many more years of VW and list 
fun.
