Subject: FREE vanagon pop top (in WV)

I don't think this message made it.  Basically I am once again trying 
to give away the '81 pop top.  It is removed from the van, rather 
unceremoniously.  Dolan had some pics up somewhere of the canvas, it is 
without rips, a fair number of pinholes, not bad for its age.  The top 
has a bunch of holes from roof racks, the fluffy stuff has some mildew, 
there is no seal, the luggage rack screws were ground off rudely into 
the rack as I was under pressure of time to get it to the recycler on a 
day off, I did not pull the rack brackets either, hey bondo and a 
little sheet metal and you are fixed.  The whole assembly has been 
sitting on the hulk of my '87 for about a month, I have no idea of the 
current condition.  The bunks are not present, the aluminum trim strips 
for the canvas are.  It should be worth free to someone.  It will be 
going with the '87 within 2 weeks.  You come, you bring me a 12 pack of 
good beer, you bring whatever sort of straps you think will hold it on 
your van, we load it up in about 30 minutes, more if we drink some of 
the beer.  It is in Clarksburg, WV.  I will not give it to you if I 
think your wife will kill you when you bring it home 8-)  Would be 
perfect if you got a sunroof and want to make a day camper, as I've 
said many times I wouldn't put it on a regular van cause I've rolled a 
regular van, and when you look at the structure added to a sunroof or 
camper, you don't have it.  Still there are plenty of people I respect 
who've done it, and Adventure and California Campers both did Vanagons.

Email me soon if you want it.
