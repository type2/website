Subject: Re: [T2] GoWesty Alloy Wheel Package

Todd,

sorry i dont have any experience with the GoWesty package that you refer to,
but let me ask a couple of questions...

&gt;&gt;I have a standard '76 Bus so it is relatively light.  I currently have the
Yokohama 356 LT tires with a load rating of C and 1600 pounds at 50 psi.
It still feels squirrely, especially in crosswinds.&lt;&lt;

i am running almost _exact_ same setup.  passenger bus &amp; Y356 C load range.
yes, it is a bit squirrely sometimes, but thats just part of driving a bus.

what pressure are you running your tires at?  if you are running 50 psi,
then thats way too much.  higher pressure will also mean less surface contact
with the road, hence giving you the squirrley behavior you mentioned. check
the Bentley &amp; make sure you are running correct pressure.

also, how are your other suspension components? (especially ball joints)

you do in fact have the correct tires for your bus, so i would start looking
at other causes to the squirrely behavior.

HTH, YMMV, etc.
