Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Suspension

&gt; Any comments on lowering the bus?  I see specialized parts for this.  I
assume

I own a lowered bus, and I own a STOCK bus too. The stock bus is the way to
go, hands down, as lowering a bus does not improve the ride, although it
does improve the handling (performance wise).

&gt; don't bother, buses have a reason for being the height they are

Very true, but I chose to lower my '77 for the look, and it looks great! I
noticed a significant increase in bounce, rough riding and overall
discomfort.

&gt; &gt; the busses had so much ground clearance to go offroad for camping, etc.
Would
&gt; &gt; lowering the bus help?  How difficult is this?  This bus is entirely
original

Lowering a bus is costly and not worth the trouble unless you are doing a
mild-custom or a show vehicle. The adjustable front beam is about $400 plus
the time or labour to install, plus a set of shocks (shortened travel), plus
turning the rear torsion leaves to match the front drop.

&gt; it's a lot of work

Very true.

&gt; keep it stock

For daily use and camping, use the above statement as the best advise. If
you want a van that is rough riding and bouncy, then lowering is an option.

I would keep it stock....
