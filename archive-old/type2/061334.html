Subject: WTF? &amp; Firewalls

Hello! Whats this?
OK, guy at work has a '94 (or so) GMC Sonoma with 4X4, extended cab
and a 4.3 liter 'Z' motor.  Oh, here's the kicker, 45,000 miles
on it!!!

What's a good price for it?
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Mark, I have an old Bug jack I would trade for this&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


&gt; Very late 68s had firewalls, there is lots of confirmation in the archives.
&gt; My (late) 68 does not. I don't see how you could get the fuel gauge sender
&gt; out either way or what difference the firewall makes. Maybe it's a Type IV
&gt; thing.
&gt;

Ken, If you have the super access hatch....the fire wall makes no difference&lt;grin&gt;
But,,,you can get the sender out,,,if you have, THE HATCH!

    Happy Holidays Volks!
