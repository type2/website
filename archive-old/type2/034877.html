I believe you have a Riviera poptop. Take a look at my site at the pictures
to see if you do. Mine is a 73 Riviera Penthouse Poptop (haven't heard of
sportsmobile yet). The plastic shell on top is taller than a Westfallia and
the poptop pops straight up, not at an angle. When the top is up, another
bed is revealed which is one of the reasons I really like my Riviera poptop.
You can still buy canvases for these as well (about $300 or so).

Got any pictures of yours? I always like to look at pictures of others
busses. :)

&gt; I recently purchased a 1974 Type 2 camper. It is very similar to a
&gt; Westfalia, but there is an aluminum placque on the back with the notation
&gt; &quot;Sportsmobile Penthouse,&quot;  Andrews, Ind. Has anyone seen one of these
&gt; before. What do I have exactly?
