Subject: Mounting a 72 and later eng in a 1971

Has anyone on the list installed a 72 and later engine in a pre 72 Bus?  What 
modifications to the engine mounts are needed?  Since my engine compartment 
has been cut it is not an issue.
Also, can anyone e-mail me some pictures of the stock mounts (the bracket 
that bolts to the engine and where it attaches to the body) on a 71 and 
earlier Bus? Thanks.

Dave
