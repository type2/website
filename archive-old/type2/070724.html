&gt;Can a dizzy for a 77 FI 2000 work on a 73 1800 single carb?  (I have a
&gt;spare)
&gt;
&gt;Where would the vac. adv. source come from for the 1800?


The Bentley gives a good overview of which dizzies provide x advance 
and y retard at various RPM. Retarding ignition is an emissions thing 
to keep the heads hot and burn off excess whatevers. As soon as you 
put your foot to the pedal the retard which is held by vacuum 
releases the plate and allows it to advance(really go to about 0 
tdc). As RPMs pick up and vacuum builds up on the other side the 
advancing process begins. Check the charts in the Bent, use a timing 
strobe light and tack dwell to chronicle the change of timing with 
rpm and see how is stacks up to the Bentley.

Warning!!!!!!!!!! Do not use the John Muir Idiot book as a reference 
to set your timing unless you can verify that you have the stock 
dizzy, and it is working 100% correctly (do you have the right carb 
with all the vac lines in the correct place. e.g. if you have a stock 
dizzy on your 72 bus and a weber carb you will need to sort out where 
to get the correct vac from. You can tap the booster line for 
manifold vac and there was one vac port under the mix screw on my old 
one. I had a mechanic measure the vac and he said it would work in 
this case. Grammar went out the window with that paragraph :)

I recommend reading the articles on www.aircooled_dot_net. John Connelly 
provides sounds info on carbs and dizzies.

If you are looking for a fight ask the list what the total advance 
for a Type 4 motor is :)

Eat more chilli!
