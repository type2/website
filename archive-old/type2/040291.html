Subject: why it overheated?

listees,
sorry for my numerous posts to the list as of late, im
just full of questions.   as you all know i had a
problem with lizzy this past weekend.  im sure ill
figure out what is wrong and correct it w/ help from
everyone, but my main concern is what caused it so it
doesnt happen again, as a cross country trip is coming
up in a month and a half.  so the description goes:
pretty flat roads i was travelling on, 55-65 mph.  
added oil before trip(maybe too much?) drove fine
there and almost back(about 60 miles round trip) then
smokin, and loss of power.   could my cooling flaps
not have opened?   tin is all in place, however
passenger side tin at front (front is front) of motor
on underside is slightly bent beat up but still all
there.  this is the tin under and to the front of the
motor, not the tin under the head.   engine seal is
intact and in good condition.   valves were adjusted
to spec.   any ideas where im goin wrong or where to
look is of course appreciated.
TIA
