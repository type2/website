Subject: Fwd:  blowby concern

 Hi,

&gt;    I recently rebuilt my 1600 dual port and am now discovering what I
think 
&gt; is blowby coming from behind the crankshaft pulley.

 Before you panic, check the crankcase breather tube is clear. If it
gets
blocked or kinked it causes this problem.

Cheers,
	W.
