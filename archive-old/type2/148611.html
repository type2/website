Subject: Re: [T2] Chinese &quot;BRUCK Germany&quot; SVDA Distributor

Hi,

Funny you should mention this. I have been running the Bruck
Distributor on and off for about 6 months now. Had a few problems with
it.

1) Didn't come with #1 notch in case. Small issue but I called CIP1 on
it - they said &quot;oops, we forgot about that&quot;.

2) Not all points work well. Some sets of points don't fit well in the
distributor plate hole. Notably the &quot;good&quot; Bosch points do not fit
(with the black and white wire, not sure of the PN off the top of my
head). The only points that really fit perfectly were the ones it came
with - these were not Bosch points (I'll have to check the
manufacturer for you)

3) May or may not be related to the previous item - Unstable timing.
At one point I was trying to set the timing and noticed it was very
jumpy. Other times seems fine. Checked for uneven shaft wear or side
to side play but none was detectable.

The only thing I liked about it was that the cap was interchangeable
with the 009 so I didn't need to move all the wires to interchange my
distributors. Apparently this is also the case with the 205ZB.

I've just bought a new Bosch Mexi 043 905 205ZB from Aircooled_dot_net
which arrived today. Wow, what a nice feeling it is to get a new part
in a box with the VW logo on it! Plan on installing it tomorrow. Will
gladly comment on its behavior at that time.

I'd be willing to send my Bruck Distributor out to someone with a
testing machine so we can get a graph of its advance curve if anyone
is interested in this undertaking. (Ratwell??)

&gt; How's the quality and/or reliability of conatruction?  Anyone use one of
&gt; these for a period of time to give an appreciable evaluation compared to
the
&gt; Brazilian/Mexican Made Bosch SVDA (043 905 205ZB) variety?  I'd like to
&gt; gather some comments out there to give people a small opinionated
&gt; write-up who visit my Bosch Ignition &amp; Distributor page on my site and an
&gt; idea of it's worth.  No names would be used to keep it anonymous.
