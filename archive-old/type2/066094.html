&gt;My problem is that I can't indent the
&gt;first line of the paragraphs of all the text. I have put in &lt;br&gt;'s at the end
&gt;of the paragraphs, which starts a new line, but I can't figure out how to
&gt;indent the first word of the paragraph the proper 5 spaces.

I don't really understand you problem. You want to have always 5 spaces 
before the first word of each paragraph. It's that?

If it's that, you can create an transparent image, named pixel.gif 
(exemple). And put the tag &lt;img src=&quot;pixel.gif&quot; width=the lenght you want 
height=1&gt; 

But I am not sure I have really understand your problem. tell me again.



I have seen your text about your cross country trip. It's cool, but it 
can be more cool with pictures? Do you have pictures of you trip???
