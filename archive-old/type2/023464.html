&lt;&lt; What you have there is the 1969/70 &quot;Stockholm&quot; or &quot;Brussels&quot; German model.
Not
 available in the USA. Depends on the rear pad. Am assumeing there is a blind
 spot cabinet. Other models had a full rear bed (1970 should, I think). I have
 the &quot;Rome&quot; model that is similar but walkthrough.  &gt;&gt;

I believe that the setup you are describing is a so-69. I have that very set
up in our 70 Dormobile.It also has the full width bed and &quot;head banger&quot;
hanging cabinet in back.Great set up, in my opinion.Very good use of space and
you can't beat the comfort of a full width bed.Especially when the little one
tries to crowd in with you.
