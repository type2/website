Yes, its true, there is a definite mathematical (not precise, though)
relationship between oil temperature, oil pressure and revs. In fact, did
you know helicopter pilots use the other two of these readings, should one
of the instruments fail? I've often pondered on the relationship, but then
it also varies with oil level, sideways acceleration (ie. going round
corners) and the condition of the engine (as well as oil grade)!

If it makes you feel better, by oil pressure was lower than yours,
consistently, and its temperature used to soar a little as well.........an
old haggard engine no doubt....but that's another story.....

&gt; &gt;I noticed that the VDO oil pressure gauge is acting weird.  The
&gt; &gt;whole trip it was at about 22 and stayed there. Now it is acting
&gt; &gt;like a tachometer.  It goes up to about 30 in first then I shift to
&gt; &gt;second and it drops down to about 20 and raises up again until
&gt; &gt;I sift into third.  Then it stays at about 24.
&gt;
&gt; It's supposed to do that.  Your oil pressure varies with engine speed.
&gt; Lower engine speed = lower oil pressure and higher engine speed = higher
oil
&gt; pressure.
&gt;
&gt; All in all, your pressure seems a little low to me, but it may just be due
&gt; to a high-mileage engine.  What weight oil are you using?  On my fresh
2.0,
&gt; running 10W-40 oil, at crusing speeds (over 3000 RPM) I run about 35 PSI
&gt; when I'm fully warmed up (like after 45 minutes on the highway).  Around
&gt; town, I see fluctuations anywhere from 20 up to 65 PSI depending on
&gt; operating temperature and engine speed.
