Subject: Re: [T2] various carb, distributor and case questions on a '71

&gt; give better performance, they say. I understand from looking in the Library
&gt; that an 009 *may* work... (remember: no flame war, please)... but is it
&gt; really the *best* thing to have in there? I've seen other possible
&gt; aftermarket options, like ANC's SVDA
&gt; http://www.aircooled_dot_net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=IGD0001&amp;cartid=0929200452269179
&gt; and Mallory
&gt; http://www.aircooled_dot_net/new-bin/viewproductdetail.php?keyword2=IGD0003&amp;cartid=0929200452269179
&gt; units, and I have had to wonder if I could be using something better.

the 009 will work but combined with a 34pict3 is even worse.

the mallory or the aircooled_dot_net svda should be better choices.
you should be able to find a rebuilt orig type though.
one source is http://www.philbingroup_dot_com/rebuilt/distributors.htm
there have been others mentioned which a search through the archives might
uncover.
also dont forget swap meets or e&amp;ay.

&gt; 2) My old carb had a warp in its barrel, and I got a new one of the same
&gt; type (34PICT-3) at a junkyard. On it was something I had not seen on my old
&gt; one, but which I have now read about in the Library: a throttle positioner.
&gt; The article in the Library suggests that this can be on or off, no big
&gt; whoop, but that it might run cleaner with it in. It doesn't sound like it
&gt; was standard on a '71, but I have the part. So, once again, I ask for your
&gt; opinion: on or off, volks? If on, are there tips for adjusting it properly?

no opinion on the positioner (no experience) but I am not a fan of 34pict3
carbs. there are new 30/31 and 34pict3 carbs available just fyi.


&gt;
&gt; 3) My bus must have originally come with an AE engine case. What came with
&gt; it when I bought it was a fresh AM type from a local bug shop. The Library
&gt; states that this is a *possible* case for 1600s, but, again, I wonder if it
&gt; is the right or best one for mine.

the AM is a 1600 replacement case. I assume it has the rear mounting
bosses and it should be fine.

good luck.
