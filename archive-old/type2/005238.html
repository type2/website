Do we maybe have a misunderstanding of terms here?

The odometer is the &quot;miles counter&quot; incorporated in the speedometer, the one
you check to see how many miles are on the bus before you buy it.

Maybe the standard odometer is being confused with a &quot;trip odometer&quot; which
can be reset when you fill up with gas or start a long journey or change the
oil and adjust the valves?

FWIW.....

&gt;I was wondering if any of you know anything about the
&gt;odometer/speedometers for the early Bays. I found one and would like to
&gt;know if they are rare, or common. Were they available all years? Dealer
&gt;option or factory? Any info would be nice. I am not interested in selling
&gt;it, just finding out more about it.


&gt;&gt;  CAn you send me more info about this, I might have one and would like to
be sure  &lt;&lt;
