Subject: Re: [T2] Engine conversion

Problem is when Manfred et all retire and the dealer no longer wants to know 
you...kind of like the situation we're all in now, come to think of it...

IIRC, there was a rather involved cooling system bleeding procedure, that,
if not followed to the letter, resulted in air locks in the system.  A big
air bubble would get into the pump and the pump would stop pumping which
is bad for cooling!

No doubt that the cooling systems were adequately designed, but this one
was not as forgiving of mistakes as the aircoolers.  This was the &quot;last
stage of the transition&quot; from vehicles that could be maintained by
farmers in the barn to vehicles that required attention from fellows
named &quot;Manfred&quot;, &quot;Karl&quot; or &quot;Otto&quot; in the spotless VW dealership.
