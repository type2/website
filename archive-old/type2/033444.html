Subject: Radio ?

	  Hello,
      I have a question for the list. I own a 72 westy w/ a 1600 dp.  I love
my bus.  I want to put in  a radio, but im afraid.  I always listen to the
engine, and i just cant seem to get my self to put in a radio.  I know it
will  make Bertha more enjoyable, my wife might even go for a ride or two.
My faith in Bertha is not 100%, she runs good, havent been in the garage for
a month or two. I just get a wierd feeling when i cant hear her, like when
shes running sweet at a red light and i cant hear an idle, till i rev the
engine. a feeling of relief.  Has any list member gone through this? or am i
just brain washed from my mechanic father?
  just curious
Chad
