&gt;I've got a 78 Westy and used the horsehair seats in a 71 and in the 78,

&gt;springs in the original seats allowed a deeper &quot;bouncier&quot; give.  On long
&gt;trips, if I want to move around on the seat, the foam seems to allow
&gt;less give.  However, one can &quot;feel&quot; the bumpiness of the
&gt;springs/horsehair combination, probably due to the fact that most
&gt;original seats lose their horsehair to age and mice, causing this feel. 
&gt;Any comment on the feel of a newly fibered seat vs an all foam one??

You can see pictures of my seat restoration here if you are interested:

The horse hair repros restore the seat to it's original shape: no over or under stuffing. There is no bumpiness as the seat is flat and wide with a slight curvature.

I can't really compare it with form because I've only owned one bus and restored the seats once.  With the new stuffing I can't feel the springs through the seats at all but I do feel the springiness of the seat frame. This may make it better than foam because it isolates you from the springs more. Before I restored the seats, I drove 3,000 miles on one trip and wasn't bothered by the seats: the upright bus driving position seemed to compensate.

I do use a very lightly padded cushion that my dad used to use because he found the passenger seat hard and cold on winter mornings; I use them more out of habit but it doesn't soften the seat just enough to make it feel a little more plush like my Acura since the coverings are so &quot;VW&quot;.
