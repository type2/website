Subject: 76 FireWagon Questions 

Well Volks, I keep peeling layer after charred layer out of my engine 
compartment, and have  few questions. I'd like to get the van running minus a 
few of the bits to prove the expensive FI parts are OK, before chasing down 
all the bits?

1. I assume the thing going into the case where the flywheel should be, with the 
charred wires is the TDC sensor. Is this true? Is it used by the van, or
just the diagnotic plug. How does it come out?

2. Speaking of the diagnostic plug being melted, are there any wires
going to it that are critical to getting the engine running, or would stop it
from running if melted together? 

3. Oil Pressure switch is melted. What years are these compatible with the one
in a 76?

4. How do I remove the firewall to get at the gas tank?. Is this possible 
with the engine in? I've removed 6 screws, but it seems to still be solidly 
attached. It goes in front of some of the engine tin at the bottom, and 
some hook like affairs at the top. Do I just pry it out?

5.There is a white translucent vacuum hose about 1/2 OD that goes through 
the firewall above the incoming fuel line. It goes to a roundish affair about 
1&quot; in diameter. What is this hose for? Do I need it for test starting?

6. There is a 1/4&quot; vacuum looking line from the EGR to a little thing 
bolted to the engine case. Another 1/4&quot; line goes through the firewall 
near the above mentioned hose on the left side. What is this? Where does this 
smaller hose go?

7. Can I run the engine (for testing purposes only) without a oil breather?
Do I just plug the vacuum hose? Do I need the charcoal canister? If not what do
I do with the hoses that go to it?

8. If I were to put a 79 FI system on this van should I use a 79 ignition
distributor too? The vacuum advance actuator seems different than my 76.
If this doesn't depend on what version of fuel injection I have on the engine, 
what does it depend on? Can I use the 79 distributor with the 76 FI stuff
to start the engine for testing.

9. How would you clean the soot, and melted rubber goo off the engine?
Would you clean it off?

10. Does anyone have a connection list for the FI wiring harness from an 
early 76 (six pin Air Flow Sensor) that would help me rebuild the wiring
harness. I need to be able to figure out which wire is which where they connect
to the various bits such as AFS, Cold Start Valve, Throttle switch .....


Please e-mail, as the digest often overflows my mailer.
Thanks for any help
