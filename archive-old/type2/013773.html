&gt;I know this is nitpicky but I had trouble with those
&gt;tires numbers because I didn't understand at first. 
&gt;A 205 tells you nothing about the height.  A 205 is
&gt;not taller than a 185.  A 205 is wider.  But a
&gt;205/70/14 is about the same height as a 185/(85)/R14. 

For all those who are too lazy to look on Tire Rack or wherever
I'll be more specific.  On a radial passenger (or reinforced or even
C load radial) tire this is how it works.

205/70R14 97

205 is width in mm.  70 is height of sidewall in percent of width.
R is radial.  It may be preceeded by speed rating which I won't
get into SR, QR, HR, VR, ZR, etc.  For a bus it is going to be R.
14 is obvioulsly rim diameter.  A number following all this is the
load rating the 97 here is something that can take about 1600
lb, I don't think there are hard and fast rules about how that is
listed.  If you can't get something that is a true C or &quot;reinforced&quot;
which is a European thing, a 97 or better (ideally 100 or more) is
what you want to be seeing.

So to get the total diameter of this tire ((2*205*0.7)/25.4)+14
the 2 is for 2 sidewalls top and bottom, the 25.4 is 25.4mm/inch
That gives a nominal 25.3&quot; diameter.

Now for the excitement, that is SMALLER in diameter than the
stock 185R14.  Depending on you POV if there isn't a profile
number it is assumed that it is either 80, 82, or 85%.  I'm going to
assume 82.  The 185R14 ends up a nominal ((2*185*.82)/25.4)+14
or 25.9&quot; diameter.

Anyway 205/70R14 is stock size on alloy wheels on Vanagons and
runs on steel rims just fine.  In fact a ridiculously large 27x8.5R14
tire mounts on those rims as well, just fine.
(truck tires are by diameter, width, rim size)

 I like the 205 on a bus or vanagon but it is also hard to find in a C
load rater.  The Tire Rack has a few choices in stock at the moment.
Other choices are 195/75R14 and even 195R14 but the latter is a bit
bigger than stock and might be just barely noticeable to the seat of
your pants.  27x8.5R14 is definitely noticeable but runnable on a
Vanagon and some fit on buses.  Which brings a final point.  These
are nominal specs and although they should mean something they
don't always when you get to the extremes.

But I'd bet any name brand 185R14, 195/75R14, 205/70R14, or 195R14
will fit just fine on a bus.  It is to also be noted although it isn't safe as
I always say I've run scores of passenger car tires that came on buses
for 100,000s of miles without issue.  If I put a set on, I put on reinforced
or C tires, but I've had no trouble with MOST passenger tires.  I've had
others that have blown out unexpectedly.  They do wallow like pigs.
I would never go run out and throw away a new set of passenger tires
that came on a bus or vanagon.  I'd inspect them frequently for bulging
uneven wear, etc and when it came time I'd buy good stuff.  These are
my personal opinions I know others have had bad experiences, so have
I but I've never lost control of a bus/van because of a blowout so I'm not
sweating it.  YMMV.

A final note is that in the specs listing for each tire, tire rack gives you
nominal diameter, widths at tread surface and max, revs/mile, etc.  Also
of course load range and may inflation.  There are a lot of good tires out
there that can take the load and have 44psi inflation pressures with
passenger style load ratings of 97 or 100.  These tires (the 205/70's here
mostly) go on big ole american cars that weigh more than your van, if
you got to choose something and can't order better, at least choose
those.

No I don't own stock in Tire Rack but I've bought my last 10? sets of
tires from them and rec them to everyone.  As a rule unless you get
an exceptional sale you will not touch their price.  I get em and have
Walmart (used to use Montgy Wards) mount and balance at $10 a pop
to get lifetime rotations and balancing.  Walmart won't F with you on
this cause they aren't going to sell the right size in the right load range
so they'll be happy to just take your $40 and tax.  If you have them
balanced every 5000, this will pay for itself quickly.  To me shipping from
the Rack is about $5/tire and they get here UPS ground in 2-3 days.
So I assume $15/tire to get em to me and balanced.  They want $50 or
so for a Yoko 356C loader which costs locally about $80 mounted and
balanced so about the same, I just like the service I've gotten from Tire
Rack.  And on V and Z rated stuff for the Corrado there was simply
no comparison, you couldn't find anything local to touch em.

These are the current 185R14 choices, unfortunately the past standout
the Conti all season for $50 is NLA.
