Dear friends:

I'm fliying to Miami next week.  Some time ago I asked if anybody could
recomend a VW suplier in the Miami area  that I could visit.   Well this
time I'm asking it again.  As some of you could see, I was out of the list
for a while and even changed address.  I would really appreciate if anyone
can recall of one or two places that I could go and check out (if I have
enough time).

Thanks to those that posted me last time but I lost all my old mail.

Thanks and regards,
Pedro P.Vivas
73 Transporter.
