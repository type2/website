Subject: [T2] Push Rods

When I had my engine out this summer I noticed that one of the push rods in
my 2.0 L w/ hyd. lifters  looked different from the rest. It was the same
length as the others but the ends were slightly different (instead of a
continuous smooth contour from the shaft to the ends it 's ends were smaller
and slightly recessed) . It was my understanding that the push rods for
solid lifters were longer so I didn't think there was a problem. I felt to
be about the same weight, maybe heavier.

If the length is right, then it must just be a different design?
