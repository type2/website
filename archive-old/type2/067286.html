Subject: Drag coefficient &amp; buses

To All:

Although any mention of streamlining and Volkswagen buses is liable to
produce a grin, there's a basic misunderstanding here that I would like to
try and clear up.

How well a thing is streamlined is determined by how much drag it creates as
it moves through the air at a given speed.  Indeed, 'streamline' is the
opposite of 'drag' in that we refer to how well something is streamlined as
its 'drag coefficient'.   'A Given Speed' is a part of the trickery so keep
your eye on it.  Even the term 'Air' is not without its confusion factor
since drag is relative to the density of the air-mass in which that
coefficient is determined.  To establish a base-line we always use  a
'standard atmosphere', meaning the air is exaclty 59 degrees Fahrenheit and
the air pressure is precisely 29.92 inches of mercury.  The combination of
pressure and temperature defines a certain air density.  Thinner air, less
drag; thicker air, more drag.

As you can see, drag is a relative thing, and when it comes to 'drag
coefficient' the thing it is relative to is the profile of the object versus
the object itself.

Just as an example, let's start with a brick (!).  If you look at a brick
head-on you see a rectangle about 2 inches high by 3 inches wide.  Head-on,
you can't tell how long the thing is, nor if its nose and tail have any
taper.  All you can see is the cross-section of its profile and that shape is
what you take as your base-line.  You start by making a flat plate having
exactly that profile but zero thickness, or as close to it as you can get --
lets say we make our profile out of  sheet steel a sixteenth of an inch
thick.  If we attach that flat plate to a pivot and put it into a wind
tunnel, blowing air against the pivoted flat plate will allow us to determine
its drag (under those conditions) simply by measuring the deflection of the
plate at the pivot point.

Now streamline your brick.  Keep the rectangular profile exactly the same but
mold a gently rounded nose on one end while building a neatly tapered cone on
the other -- turn your brick into a teardrop, or as near to a tear-drop shape
as you can get without altering the rectangular profile.  

Ready for the big surprise?  When you hang your tear-dropped shaped brick in
the wind tunnel you will discover its drag is about ONE-TENTH that of the
flat steel plate having exactly the same profile!  Dividing the drag-number
for the streamlined shape into the drag-number for the flat-plate shape is
what gives us our 'coefficient' of drag.  In this case it would be about
0.10.

You can spend a lot of time refining the nose and tail shape of your brick
but you'll find that you'll never get the drag coefficient below 0.10.
 Indeed, you'll probably never achieve that mystical number because that's
about as good a streamline as you can achieve with even the most perfectly
shaped object.

Now put the brick aside and lets go look at a Volkswagen bus.  Again, lets
stand out in front of the thing and determine its frontal profile -- it's
'flat-plate' area.  The drag of the flat-plate area -- at a given speed --
becomes one factor in our equation.  We then measure the drag of the bus and
plug in that number as the other factor.  Divide the one into the other and
you have the coefficient of drag for the bus.

Ready for your next surprise?  The drag co-efficient for a splitie is about
.28!  That is to say, the VW bus is a pretty slick little brick :-)

Alright, stop laughing -- the trickery in the above numbers is that the drag
of the bus was measured at something like 30 miles per hour or its equivalent
in meters per second, which is some kind of a standard.  Still, .28 is not
too shabby for a brick.

The ratio between the length and width of a thing is called its 'Fineness
Ratio' and up to a certain point, the longer it is, the lower its coefficient
of drag.  But some of the drag comes from the air sliding along the surface
of the thing so there is a point of diminishing returns in the fineness-ratio
trick -- make it too long (or drive it too fast) and drag is bound to go up.

What's all this mean?

Not much, really.  Without a tail-cone and more slope to the nose, the
Volkswagen bus is about as 'smooth' as it can get, aerodynamically speaking.
 And while .28 is pretty good it reflects only the coefficient of drag -- the
actual drag itself is quite large.  In order to lower the gross or actual
drag yet retain the interior volume you would have to use a shape such as
found on, for example, the Toyota Previa wagon or similar.

But it's far to say that despite their boxy shape early Volkswagen buses are
remarkably well streamlined.
