Subject: Re: [T2] Tow Hitch needed for 68' Kombi

In a message dated 6/8/04 6:12:01 PM, urban_at_yaic_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; I'm looking for a tow hitch to attach to my 68' Kombi.  I need to tow a 
small boat (14' sail boat), as well as the empty trailer from my &quot;big boat&quot;.

Recalling the posts about towing capacity of the Type 2, I'll add that each 
of these items weighs less than 500 lbs and will be towed less than 10 
miles/trip across flat prarie roads :-)

TIA.
