Did you check compression yet? I'd be curious about the valve adjustment. If 
you get an aircooled engine real hot and shut it down the valves sometimes 
stretch. (I've seen it on type one engines I would believe the same from the 
type IV) I always would drive slowly the last several miles before shutting 
down after a long run. When I was 19 I worked in a machine shop the old pro 
working there showed me a deisel truck head all cracked from shutting down 
without letting it cool down. SO IMHO check compression and valve adjustments.
