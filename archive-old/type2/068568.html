Subject: Her Majesty's Last Day :~(

Well - it is Friday - and this is about a VW... (hope I don't get in 
trouble for this fluff (?) I'm not sure I know what all the hoop-la was 
about but it sure seems that Friday's are boring now!)

Her Majesty just had her valves and oil done, it's starting to snow 
like ten kinds of mother fathers and we're heading down to put the old 
girl to pasture for a while. Weather rumor has it that this series of 
storms will last 10 days, so I'll be busless and hatin' life till it 
clears up. She's going into her new garage 15 miles south of Mammoth. 
I'll be missin' her something fierce so please everybody, keep up the 
happy talk about buses so I can enjoy them vicariously. Things will 
cheer up when the snow clears up.

Happy Firday!

Kath and Her Purpleness &lt;---- off to storage!
