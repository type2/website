Subject: Online Mag

Hey guys, just to let you know, I have started a &quot;Featured VW's&quot; section on 
my website which will be like an online mag and I was hoping that if any of 
you have time, you could submit your vw to be seen by 1000's.  I just created 
this section so I have no cars in it yet but the submissions are slowly, but 
surely coming in. I have 14 so far and wouldl ike to have more to choose 
from.  Please submit them at www.vdubs_dot_com/cars/submit.shtml
thanks
