The only things that have not been swapped out are the brake lines and drums.

If you're certain that you have done the wheel cylinder work properly and
that all air is out of the system, I would suggest replacing the rubber
brake lines.  These can swell over time and become restricted resulting in
uneven braking, especially if the wrong fluid was used at some point.  They
are not terribly expensive or hard to replace.  You might also want to
check that there are no kinks anywhere in the metal brake lines, especially
on the side opposite the way the vehicle is pulling.
