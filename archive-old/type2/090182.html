Subject: Re: [T2] Bus in the 4th of July parade

&gt; I am going to have my Bus pulling a float (farm wagon that can be
&gt; pulled by one person so isn't to heavy) in a parade and was wondering
&gt; if the List could give me some advice (besides not to do it) on
&gt; keeping my engine cool.  Of course it will be hot that day and I will
&gt; be going at idle speed.  There will be a generator to operate

My busses have always run cool at low speeds and idle.
Run hottest at top speed fighting the wind resistance or on hills.
The float isnt heavy I dont think you need to worry about it.
