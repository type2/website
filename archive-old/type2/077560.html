Subject: Re: [T2] big exhaust - '77 2.0L Westy

--0-1485041264-1013031372=:26463


I would like to jump in on this thread because following Honda and Toyota with big exhaust kits have got me thinking.

It is my understanding that a tuned exhaust is the most efficient method of &quot;exhausting&quot; your engine short of no exhaust pipe at all.  The principle being that a tuned exhaust has the proper resonant frequency to allow airflow through the exhaust system.
It was explained to me by using a jump rope.  If one person holds the one end of the rope still, and another person moves the other end up and down, you have hit the harmonic frequency of the rope when it looks like a perfect sine wave (wave equal on top and bottom). Go a little faster or slower, and things get all messed up because the wave is out of sinc and working against itself.
The same holds true in muffler systems. In a tuned muffler, someone has taken the time to crunch the numbers and figure out the correct harmonics so that the exhaust pipe will be in tune with the size engine being used.  
While theoreticley a larger diameter muffler will allow more air to travel through it thus reducing backpreasure and in turn increasing HP, this is only true when the harmonics of the system line up.  In other words, your large diameter muffler can end up costing you HP instead of gaining it.

This is only my understanding of how it works but I would like list input especially any areas where I am assuming too much.

Thanks,
rick

&gt; or you could convert to the earlier exhaust system

&gt; is readily avaliable and is &quot;sort of&quot; a header by

&gt; 
&gt; I did it on my 78 and it has been far better than
&gt; that old system, however
&gt; I didn't notice any power increase, SOP system (Seat

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am looking to put a larger than stock exhaust
&gt; system on my 77 westy. my 
&gt; &gt; discovery at the local vw import store yesterday
&gt; was that the Dual Quiet 
&gt; &gt; Pack system is unavailable for busses from 75-79.
&gt; So, i could have a single 
&gt; &gt; QP, which feels like less than maximum airflow.
&gt; So, does anyone have a 
&gt; &gt; source for a fatboy or other large exhaust for the
&gt; late 70's busses. i am 
&gt; &gt; considering the ceramic sinlge QP bupack system,
&gt; any thoughts on all this 
&gt; &gt; rambling?
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; -jeremy
