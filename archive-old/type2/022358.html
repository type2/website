&gt;&gt;I've read instructions on getting glass into the windows of a van (1/4'

&gt;Cut the seal.

That method certainly works but is not necessary.  It is a simple matter to remove the flat windows without destroying the seal or the window.  The front windshield is more difficult, although still possible to do, but given the cost of a replacement windshield and the low price of seals it might be more prudent to cut the seal for the front windshield. The rest of the windows are a piece of cake.  I recently removed every window in my bus (to tint the glass, fix some rust and replace the seals) without cutting or breaking anything.  I could have cut the seals for the side windows, but it wouldn't have saved me any significant amount of time and involves exacto knives which means there is a potential to get cut and to scratch paint.  The seal in the rear hatch was less than a year old so there was no way I was going to cut that one.

I took some photos of the process.  I haven't had time to narrate them yet, but you can get an idea of how to go about removing a window without destroying the seal by looking at the following pictures:
