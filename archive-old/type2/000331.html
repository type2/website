You replaced the filter; did you check the volume of fuel from the fuel
pump? Does this happen under load going up a hill, even at lower speeds? Did
you use a fuel pressure gauge and check the pressure on the fuel ring after
you put the new regulator on?

One thing to check is point gap. I have had this same affect from to narrow
a point gap on mine.

Just a thought!

&gt;After the bus warms up with some driving-anywhere from 5-15 miles, the bus
&gt;'hiccups'.  I will be on the gas and the bus will start to buck.  I can
&gt;lower my speed around 55 or below and I generally will not have the problem
&gt;anymore.  I have also recently replaced my fuel filter,  put a used double
&gt;relay in (off of another bus), and replaced the fuel pressure regulator.
&gt;
&gt;I have been able to get to my destination each time I drive it but it never
&gt;is a good feeling.
