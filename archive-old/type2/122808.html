Subject: Re: [T2] BAttery drain

get thyself to the local Radio Shack or home improvement store &amp; get a 
multi-meter.

they are only about 20 bucks.

then you can do the 'pull the fuses one-by-one' trick &amp; it will show 
you when nothing is draining the battery. you will need to do this with 
a fully-charged battery.

however, go to one of the local FLAPS first &amp; get them to test your 
battery for free.

good luck,
