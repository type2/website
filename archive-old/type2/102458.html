&gt;   Rancho will rebuild an automatic (r/p and/or gearbox) but not the brain.

by the brain are you referring to the valve body??

&gt; The Converter shop here in Lake Havasu will rebuild your torque converters.

well there is a local shop here (DelMarva Converter source) that has done
TC for me, they seem to do good work and will rebuild one for $125

&gt; They also manufacture new auto (bus) imput shafts, r/p carriers and other
&gt; assorted auto parts to beef up the trans. They also have someone who
&gt; rebuilds them for them (performance only). Type 4 auto's are the hottest
&gt; item in the off road crusier world now and are in big demand out here on the
&gt; west coast.

oh really, wonder what the 4 &quot;cores&quot; sitting in my garage are worth??

got an e-mail, website, phone number for em??

&gt; ps. AUDI and some other German marks use the same gearbox section as the
&gt; bus, only the r/p section is different. I have heard of an AUDI 5 speed auto
&gt; being put in a bus.

the Audi 5 speed, hmmmm, tell me more

thanks
Bob
