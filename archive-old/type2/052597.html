Subject: [T2] VANFEST - now has it's own web site

Those list members in the UK will certainly have heard of VANFEST but for 
those not in the know it is an annual show and rally for VW Vans - certainly 
the biggest &quot;VW vans only&quot; show in the UK and probably in Europe (if not the 
world) too.

The show which is organised by the VW Type 2 Owners Club (www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk) 
now has its own web site so any one who has a blank date in their diary for 
14-16 September 2001 should point their browsers at www.vanfest_dot_org 

If you just want to see some of what goes on in the UK van show scene then 
take a look too as there are reports of previous shows on the site too.

Good luck
