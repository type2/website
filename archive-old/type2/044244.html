Subject: Re: [T2] bucking adendum

In regards to the ECU knowing your at full throttle, that is a yes. 
There is a &quot;full enrichment&quot; switch mounted on the throttle housing.

I was talking with my mechanic a while back and he had mentioned that if
the little contact slider plate goes out (inside the AFM), he would
order a new little PCB and replace it, instead of replacing the whole
thing...

Did you check the resistances of the AFM as described in the bentley
manual?

Hope that helps.
Mike

&gt; original message:
&gt; I need some advice.  My '77 FI bucks as if missing when I drive with the
&gt; throttle anywhere between all the way up and floored.  In neutral the motor
&gt; revs up fine and I can hold it at half throttle and it doesn't miss.  It
&gt; only bucks when the motor is under a load.  If I floor it or let all the way
&gt; up it stops bucking.  I just finished a tune up hoping to find the problem
&gt; but it is still there.  I can't really drive it to work anymore.  It's got
&gt; new rotor, cap, wires, and plugs.  Timing is right on at idle and advances
&gt; with RPM.  Starts up hot or cold and idles fine.  I fixed all vacuum leaks.
&gt; It's got the stock vacuum/mechanical advance distributor and if I rotate the
&gt; rotor clockwise and let it go it snaps back into position.  It's bucked
&gt; before but more intermittently and I always thought it was an electrical
&gt; problem and I'd get a new cap and it would go away for a while.  Could the
&gt; air flow meter be worn out?  Does the ECU have any way of knowing full
&gt; throttle besides the AFM (...as it runs fine at full throttle)?  Thanks!
&gt; Any advice is greatly appreciated!
