Subject: Re: [T2] vac dizzy help on 71 1600 dp...

Thanks Dave, here are my responses.


&gt;but it looks to me like
&gt;the wires are 1 off, or the distributor is timed off

I've verified and reverified and rereverified again that they are going to 
the right places. Wire above notch is going to #1  and the rest go counter 
close wise 2,3,4 correct? Also I have physically verified TDC and the pulley 
notch is stock on this engine and marks 5ATDC.


&gt;You never blow on a vacuum port to test it, only suck.  If you do this and
&gt;the vac arm inside doesn't move, then part of the vac unit is shot...or if
&gt;you suck on it and just keep getting air, then the vac unit is shot.

I tried sucking on both ports, the arm doesn't move at all. Could it be 
hooked up incorrectly or does this mean 100% that the vacuum is kaput?
