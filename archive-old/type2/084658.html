&gt;Hello all,
&gt;             Most know that I have a 78 Bay with a type IV engine.  Some
&gt;may have noticed at EB that I have a Cali spec engine.  Meaning that I
&gt;have a catalytic converter.  When I was in California, of course I had
&gt;no option but to leave it on.  Now that I am in NC and emissions are not
&gt;a problem, I was wondering if I would be able to remove the cat without
&gt;causing any problems with the engine.  I am hoping that I may get a
&gt;little more horse power from doing this.  Or, should I leave it on as
&gt;this is how it the engine was meant to be used?  Thanks

I would leave it on and consider myself lucky.  The catalytic converter 
will keep you from smelling those nasty exhaust smells that sometimes waft 
into your bus at stoplights with the windows down.  It will also quiet the 
engine down a little more.  I would love to put one on my bus and would if 
there was an easy way to do it.  If you want a couple of extra horsepower, 
I'd recommend getting it some other way.
