Subject: Air flow meter 76-78

I have an airflow meter from a late 76 to a 78 bus (can't narrow it down 
more than that). It's missing the cap, plug, and contacts. Does anyone 
have those pieces, or an otherwise non-working meter, so that I can see 
if it works? 

Yesterday I scoured the pick-and-pulls in San Diego and managed to find 
90% of the FI parts I need to swap from carbs, and pass California smog.
I'm resigned to getting a rebuilt airflow meter (thanks to Old Volks Home), 
but if I can avoid it I can spend the money on an auxillary battery and 
other goodies.

If I shouldn't be mucking with the airflow meter, feel free to flame be 
via e-mail.
