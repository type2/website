Subject: Re: [T2] musical bus?

[...]I hate this filter.

Clutch pedal in - whining sound is throwout bearing (mine has been whining
for a year now, goes away when it warms up).

Clutch pedal out - rattley, grinding sound is pilot bearing (mine has been
doing this for a year or so, intermittantly).

&gt; is there any reason the clutch would sing when idling? i have started
&gt; hearing this whirring sort of noise when i am sitting at a stop
&gt; sign/light. if i start to let off the clutch, it changes. when i am
&gt; driving, i dont seem to hear it... then again, it is hard to hear much of
&gt; anything over the exhaust leak noise.
&gt; 
&gt; is there a fuel pump inside the gas tank in the 70 bus? could that be it?
