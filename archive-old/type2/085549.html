Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Hubcap? (LONG!)

Pretty good job with the memory Mike, but until you see the box for
yourself, you can't believe where this sucker has been!!  Really need to go
through the log book, then document each item and make a map of it's
travels.  This really has touched a bunch of us, I was honored to have it
sit on my dining room table if but for a short time and go through some of
the relics.  This really does remind me of Charlie's travels a few years
ago.

&gt; Well I'll be a splitty's uncle!!  So the hubcap has finally crossed the big
&gt; river and is seeing new sights.  That's really cool.  For those of you who
&gt; don't remember (or who weren't on the list 3-4 years ago), Charlie Ford
&gt; originally came up with the idea of passing something from bus to bus from the
&gt; east coast to the west coast and maybe back again with a log book to document
&gt; it's journey.  One of the first suggested items to be passed was a lawn
&gt; jockey, 
&gt; but that seemed a little big so the hubcap was settled on.
&gt; 
&gt; When the idea got posted to the list, a lot of folks thought it was cool, but
&gt; were worried that the fairly direct route that was being considered would
&gt; leave 
&gt; them out.  So I jumped in and worked with Charlie and the idea was modified to
&gt; have the route zig and zag up and down through the U.S. to touch as many
&gt; people 
&gt; as possible.  Everyone thought this sounded great so someone (sorry, I don't
&gt; remember who - maybe someone name Ian?) put together a web site with a way to
&gt; sign up where you were and how far you could drive with the hubcap and the
&gt; journey was launched.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything went pretty good for a few months as the hubcap travelled down the
&gt; east coast and the website was updated regularly with progress.  Pictures were
&gt; taken of the handoffs, odds and ends were added to travel with the hubcap, and
&gt; someone tossed in a box to hold all the stuff.  But then, for some reason,
&gt; interest waned and the hubcap disappeared from sight for a while.  Finally it
&gt; turned up again (in Florida I think) and arrangements were made to get it to a
&gt; big bus show somewhere in the southern states (sorry, again, my memory is
&gt; fuzzy 
&gt; and I don't remember people and places).
&gt; 
&gt; Then, for some reason, the hubcap seemed to backtrack and some of the same
&gt; people even carried it for a second time while it seemed to travel up and down
&gt; the country, but never moving west.  Another listee stepped in and tried
&gt; valiantly to get the thing moving again, but after being ragged on time and
&gt; time again, decided that involvment was a big pain in the ass and gave up.
&gt; 
&gt; So for the past 1-2 years the hubcap has been travelling around fairly well,
&gt; but has never made much progress toward the west.  I believe it even went to
&gt; Canada and back.  Nothing to complain about, but it's been kind of a sore
&gt; subject off and on since it seemed like it would never leave the Eastern U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; But now I hear it is in Kansas and Britt Grannis is taking it (in the infamous
&gt; Road Cow no less!) to the Classic where it will no doubt move on to new hands.
&gt; Maybe we can get it moved through Colorado this Summer during the RMMW show?
&gt; I'll keep my fingers crossed, my ears open for it's whereabouts, and my bus
&gt; tuned up and ready to go meet someone to collect it :)

&gt; slighted anyone, please accept my appologies and feel free to post corrections
&gt; to the list and/or me, but please, please, please don't jump down my throat
&gt; about any of this.  I remember some of the ugly emails and bad feelings that
&gt; this idea has generated over the past 3 years and I don't want to get in the
&gt; middle of any of them again.  That's why people like myself, Charlie Ford,
&gt; Ian?, and Chris Huff washed our hands of trying help the hubcap along on it's
&gt; journey in the first place.  The hubcap is a cool idea and (hopefully) it'll
&gt; eventually find it's way through everyone's hands that want to see it.
