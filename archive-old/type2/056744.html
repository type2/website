Subject: Safety and Lock Rear Hatch!!!!

     Just a quick warning,
     
     Mike posted that if you do put the wire on the rear hatch to open it 
     from inside you should make sure it is out of reach of your children.
     
     Good idea, but locking the rear hatch will NOT help, so do NOT rely on 
     it.
     
     When you lock the rear hatch all you do is stop a lever on the 
     cylinder from coming into contact with lever that opens the hatch 
     (i.e. the one you put your wire through).  You can still open the 
     hatch from the inside by pulling on your wire.  
     
     Just a quick safety note.
     
     See you on the road.
