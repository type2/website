Gentlepersons-
                       I've got the chance to pick up Lindsay Porter's &quot;VW 
Beetle &amp; Transporter
Guide to Purchase &amp; DIY Restoration&quot; - Sight unseen, but cheap. Anyone 
familiar with the
book? Exactly how much Transporter info? I've got Porter's book on my Bugeye 
and find
it a good source, but wonder about a split (no pun), between the two 
vehicles. BTW, I've
got a Bay, so if someone has the book...Is the info applicable?
TIA
