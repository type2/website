&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a 75 westy with an automatic transmission.  I am in the process 
&gt; &gt; &gt; rebuilding the engine now and it seems everything is broke.  When I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bought it I brought it down to get looked over and the mechanic called 
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying the gear box was filled with red transmission fluid, it was 
&gt; &gt;leaking
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;???? not sure what you mean, the final drive had tranny fluid??
&gt; 
&gt; The transmission and differential had the transmission fluid in it.  I hope 

there is a seal between the auto tranny and the final drive, 

&gt; that this did not ruin it.  If the differential has been messed up will this 
&gt; lead to other problems (ie. ruining the transmission, engine, torque 
&gt; converter, etc.?

if the fluid was in the final drive I wouldn't depend on the drive being
in good shape

&gt; &gt;again not sure what part you mean, the torque convertor is connected to
&gt; &gt;the flex plate (which is connected to the crankshaft) by three tempered
&gt; &gt;bolts with large flanges on em...they go into a lug like projection on the
&gt; &gt;side of the torque converter,  if one of these is broken, the torque
&gt; &gt;converter is scrape metal, unless you are one heck of a weldor.  if you
&gt; &gt;are referring to one of the 4 mounting points for the engine to mount to
&gt; &gt;the tranny to hold them in the van, this may be fixable.
&gt; 
&gt; there were two parts that I took apart to get the engine out.  one was 
&gt; taking the bolts out that hold the drive plate to the something made of 

there is a &quot;flex plate&quot; that takes the place of a flywheel it is bolted to
the crankshaft.  the big heavy thing with 3 ears on it is the torque
converter.  these three bolts must be sound (ask me how I know)

&gt; steel (I thought it was the torque converter, but I need to check on that) 
&gt; and the  other 4 bolts that are attached to a cast iron housing around the 

well actually aluminum

&gt; torque converter or what ever it is. (when i mounted it to the engine stand 
&gt; I used these holes in the engine to bolt it to the stand) This cast iron 
&gt; piece is what is broke... So you say it may be fixable?  Or do you think I 
&gt; could just replace the cast iron piece?

this piece is is removable and can be changed, BUT it is not avaliable
from any source, and the Manual/auto &quot;Bell housings&quot; are different so you
would need one from an auto tranny (oh the starters are different too,
don't swap)

&gt; Thanks for the help.  I need all I can get.

not hard, BUT the auto tranny is different in a lot of ways, even the tune
up spec's are different, get the Bentley manual.
