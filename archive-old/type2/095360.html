Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Broken Easy Out

Markus,

Thanks for your response. It's a innovative technical approach.
Having a number of successful easy out extractions on door hinges I thought 
this would be &quot;easy&quot; also.

I have a rotozip and will invest in a diamond dremel bit. I like the left 
hand drill idea as well. The drill is inherently matched to the hole. 
Grinding some of the tapered tip off the easy out tool and using more of the 
shank seems to me a similar way of matching and maximizing the working 
torque of the tool.

Hindsight: Destructively measuring the maximum working torque of a easy out 
sample in a test hole and then appling a second identical tool with a torque 
wrench would have saved me trouble and money.  Even if the the max working 
torque fell short I would have had the drill-tap option.

Thanks for not scolding or sending me to a MACHINIST. I understand they have 
special punishments for easy out abusers.

Chuck
