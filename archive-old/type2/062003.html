&gt;anyone have any help on  how to set the timing on the above listed setup

Duncan,
In a street driven 1600 with around 7.0-7.5 cr running 91-93 octane gas you'll
want about 28 degrees total advance (if you hear pinging, back it off a degree
or two). Brazilian 009's have about 21 degrees total advance at about 2625 rpm;
German, 24 at 2250. So, if you set the timing statically (with the little light
bulb, ala Muir, one side of the light grounded, the other on the negative side
of the coil, the one that goes to the condenser), you'd set the Brazilian at 7
BTDC (target of 28 total, so 28-21=7) and the German at 4.The advance curves
also differ slightly. It's unlikely that you have the German distributor, since
they are no longer in production, but it'll say somewhere in/on the distributor
(the German one has a raised emblem on the bottom, near where the distributor
fits in the case, that says GERMANY).
Remember, the crankshaft rotates clockwise, so you'll want the light to come on
7 degrees BEFORE (to the right of) the mark on the pulley lines up with the
split in the case. So, set the crank with the pulley pointing to the 7 degree
mark to the right of TDC lined up with the split in the case (0 will be to the
left of the split, approaching the split), rotate the distributor until the
light comes on, then tighten the distributor clamp. You should be all set.
