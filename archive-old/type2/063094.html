Subject: FS: 71 Westy Poptop, KC

Hi,

Some folks I know have a 71 Westy (?) poptop they are interested in
selling, but I don't know a lot about it.  It has a fresh motor overhaul 
from a very good mechanic.  Some local vandals $crewed up the tent in the 
pop-top.  It's almost road worthy, but it's been sitting in a barn for a 
while.  They say the body's pretty decent and has a rust spot on the
driver's side rocker, but I have not seen it. It is red and has been
re-painted, $1000 obo. If you're in the market fot a 71 Westy
and are feeling adventurous, email me and I'll put you in touch with the
sellers.  They are in Plattsburg, MO, just north of Kansas City.
