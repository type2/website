&gt;     Just wondering who all these people are that own Busses,,,,
&gt; Kind-of a what you do for a living that you can afford to drive these
&gt; things????
&gt;     I myself am a student working under a student status at a local
&gt; hospital,,,,
&gt; Anyone else????

I manage electronic publishing projects for a publishing services company 
but when I bought/used my camper most was when I was a cash-strapped grad 
student.  The bus was most economical and actually *paid for itself*.

I bought it originally for fieldwork (I was a geologist) so grants paid me 
mileage during field seasons.  Then when some buds of mine who sang in a 
Russian chorus discovered I owned a Bus, I was immediately conscripted 
(without audition!).  They needed the Bus (not me!) for tours -my singing 
ability was *definitely* below their standard and my Russian was 
non-existent.  They paid mileage that more than covered my expenses but was 
competitive with renting a van from a rental company.  So you might say 
that because of the Bus, I now sing pretty well ..... y pa Russki !

Also, hanging out with other students who tend to move frequently, my 
services as a &quot;moving van&quot; usually supplied me with untold free meals/beers 
and, occasionally, a few extra bucks which I usually stashed for 
maintenance.  Road trips with friends usually also covered all my travel 
expenses.

But the greatest thing about the Bus, besides the peace of mind it gave me 
that I would NOT be at the mercy of garages 'cause I could do my own 
repairs and such (which, when you compare with *other car* repairs/parts, 
are damn cheap), were the other opportunities and avenues and relationships 
it opened up.

Plus, I always have a *free* place to stay :)  The $$ I saved sleeping in 
the bus, for example, in a beach parking lot in Key West alone probably 
covered all my expenses for one year's worth of maintenance.  Plus it was 
more scenic and probably more comfortable!

In the least, it's been very cost-effective transportation.
