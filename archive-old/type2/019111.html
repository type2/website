&gt; All this discussion of HEAT has prompted me to improve the heat in
&gt; Bleu.  So, what are you all using for a main heater duct (from the 'Y'
&gt; pipe at the rear to the diverter valve in the front)?  I've searched
&gt; locally and the best that I've found is either 3 or 4 inch dryer duct.
&gt; Plastic...  Not exactly what I had in mind.  Is the stock paper/tin foil
&gt; pipe available?  (Ron?)
Jim:
The original pipe is mild steel sheet, just like the rest of the type 2.
It's covered with a thin quilted insulation blanket that's vinyl on the
outside to keep it from absorbing water. These parts have typically been
gone from the vehicles I've driven for 10-15 years by now. I've tried
welding straight exhaust pipe(from your friendly local muffler
shop-FLMS) back in the opening, but by far the simplest, most satisfying
fix(for me) is 2&quot; PVC DWV pipe for 68-72 and 3&quot; for the later loafs.
That is, indoor drain piping! For the 68-72 the 2&quot; is a slip fit into
the existing holes where the old steel pipe used to be. I make the piece
too long (maybe about 3&quot; too long), slide one end into the opening, then
align the second end and then center it. I then use some kind of
waterproof caulk like silicone to adhere it into position. Since the PVC 
doesn't conduct heat very well, I've never been too concerned about
insulating it, though it certainly would be a good idea. Obviously this
is not going to win points in a concours event, but in the case of my
vehicles, it's hardly an issue. It's quick, easy, won't rust out again.
I've used the 3&quot; size as a direct replacement for the defunct BA-6
heater in my 78. It clamped right in its place using the original
clamps!
I'm reasonably certain the replacement panel people make the original
steel tube as well.
