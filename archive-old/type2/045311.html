Subject: [T2] heater box connections to center tube

Hi,

I am trying to find a suitable way to connect a heater box to the central
tube. The origianl metal ringy thing is in bad shape. I have a rubber set
from a bay window but they are too long and do not fit. I suspect that the
temperature is rather high in this region and care should be given to
selection of a material so that will not melt or gave off some sort of
noxious fumes(other then the normal VW fumes:) but provide some sort of
insulation.

Is there something off the shelf at Home Depot, Lowes or some other home
center? How about that metal flex tube that connects the fan shroud to the
heater boxes? Please share your ideas and experiences with me!
