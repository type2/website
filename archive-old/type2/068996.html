Okay, I still have it, here it is....

&gt;Subject: Starter Problem cure - Bosch WR1 kit
&gt;
&gt;Yo, all!
&gt;
&gt;Since we seem to be about to start another round of no-start stories, let
&gt;me do my best to cut to the chase.  Yes, St. Muir's ford solenoid trick
&gt;works.  GM, Chrysler, and (probably) Fiat have made similar starter relays
&gt;at one time or another. In addition and finally, Mr. Robert Bosch awoke
&gt;one fine morning and found that the tooth fairy had left something closely
&gt;resembling a clue under his pillow.  Marching his rear down to the shop,
&gt;he must have handed it off to his engineers with the question, &quot;Why can't
&gt;we make something like this that is elegant, requires no cutting of wires
&gt;and minimal drilling into the body of those old busses?&quot;
&gt;
&gt;The end result of this process is something called the &quot;Bosch WR-1 kit&quot;.
&gt;It comes with a relay, all the correct conectors, a detailed instruction
&gt;sheet, and is fused _at_ 15 amps.  You need only drill one hole in your
&gt;precious bus for a sheet metal screw to suspend the sucker and ground it.
&gt;This solution was proposed first by some (unknown, but applauded) other
&gt;list member back a bit.  As my bus has been a notorious non-starter, I
&gt;went down and tried to find it.  The perversity of nature dictates that
&gt;such an incredibly useful item be impossible to find, and indeed this is
&gt;true.  The WR-1 kit is only ever mentioned in a footnote in the starter
&gt;section of the Bosch master catalog :-( Getting your standard issue
&gt;parts-dweeb to actually find the entry, not to mention acquire one is nigh
&gt;on to impossible.  Fortunately, y'all may take advantage of the multiple
&gt;phone calls I made to innumerable FLAPS and to Robert Bosch, USA and find
&gt;the damned thing almost immediately by calling the following Company:
&gt;
&gt;Olympic Auto Parts
&gt;5168 Eisenhower Avenue
&gt;Alexandria, VA  22304
&gt;Tel. - (703) 370-0850
&gt;
&gt;Once you have reached this august assemblage of parts salesmen, ask
&gt;specifically for David Parker, as the rest of the counter-persons are
&gt;clueless as a clam on this particular item.  He will sell you one of these
&gt;kits for the princely sum of ~$11.00 US plus shipping.  As of last week,
&gt;they still had 2 in stock, though Monseur Parker promised to support all
&gt;the business I could send his way.  Standard disclaimers apply.  I ain't
&gt;even that thrilled with these folk generally, as I have had any number of
&gt;orders misfilled, but I do trust this one guy a bit and all they have to
&gt;handle is two letters, a number and a hyphen.  Try your local people
&gt;first, but if that doesn't work I offer this as an alternative.
