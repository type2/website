Well, I found an automotive machinist in Roseburg who seems to be up to the
job of doing the delicate parts of my rebuild. He's a nice guy, straight
forward, and works on aircooled VWs all the time. He even let me look at
his equipment and some heads that were part way done, and he's been open in
that spot for 30 years. He also quoted me $350 - $600 depending, and will
tear it down and inspect it for me for next to nothing. We talked for half
an hour about engine pulling in Type II's. 

Now, am wondering about the issue of valve seats that everyone talks about.
As I follow it, there's some kind of modification that is important to make
in the process of rebuilding the heads. What exactly should be done to the
head to help prevent the dropped valve seats? Or is this more a matter of
opinion? I should have asked him about what he usually does, but for some
reason it didn't occur to me. 

Thanks. 

JT
