&gt; everyone that has responded has told me to start the hunt for a new

&gt; rought to go.  I live in Minneapolis/St.Paul area and am aparently in the
&gt; hunt for a good autotransmission.  Anyone that knows where I can get one, or 
&gt; has another idea about what I should do please let me know.

try to find a 77-79 auto tranny, make sure to get the front shifter mech
as it is different and not interchangeable,  lighter, stronger, and parts
are (more or less) still avaliable
