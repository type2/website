&gt; I have rebuilt fuel pumps for other cars before. Is there any reason

&gt; Bus Boys.

It really is a piece of cake to rebuild the pump.  Sorry I can't help with
U.S. sources but I bought the kit from Just Kampers in the UK 4 years ago.
You get the diaphragm with plunger and a new gasket in the kit.  Should be
something in the region of $20 or less.

&gt; What are the pro and cons of using an electric fuel pump?

Something else to go wrong?
