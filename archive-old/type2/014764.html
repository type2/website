Hello everyone,
  I have a 71 Bus that now sports a SO-69 Euro Westy interior. I am in need
of some information about this setup and I also need some parts. I would
really love to hear from anyone US or Europe that has one of these Westies.
I found 2 people in the archives, but there E-mail address is now no good.
Any help would be wonderful.
