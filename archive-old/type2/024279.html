Subject: Overheat problem?
Message-ID: &lt;7jeh9l$5khv_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

I have a '77 bus with a fuel injected 2-liter. The engine was purchased as a rubuild at Kragen 2 years ago and installed by me. It ran fine for aprox 6 months then began to overheat (no temp light, just noticing the temp after a trip) I checked the valve adjustments and they would be tight, once loosened and set at the proper gap, the bus ran fine. Finally, the adjustments stopped helping and the engine would get so hot that I couldn't touch the bumper! So, I've pulled the engine and it looks fine! The valves look ok as do the cylinders. What next? I really don't know much about engines but want to keep my bus.
