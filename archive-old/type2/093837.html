Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Oil Cooler 

Probably not.  I have left the covers off (while testing some things. at 
idle just little spray and a dribble that flowed back in.  Hit a high 
rev and watch the oil shoot out.  Not recommended for driveways or with 
engine in vehicles.  test stand with lots of clearance only and rags to 
catch it..  This oil running through  is not going to do a lot for 
cooling of the heads though.

&gt; I remember seeing some pictures on muffler mikes website a few years ago
&gt; where he had some kind of valve covers with windows in them and at 
&gt; varying
&gt; RPM,s the oil that accumulated in the area between the valve cover and 
&gt; head
&gt; increased and at 5000 RPM, this area was about 1/2 to 2/3 full of oil.
&gt; Maybe it was an optical delusion.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Only a few drops of oil ever reach the heads, try taking off
&gt;&gt;&gt; the valve covers and running the engine some time, you will only see
&gt;&gt; small
&gt;&gt;&gt; drops come splattering off the rockers, not near enough to cool a 400
&gt;&gt;&gt; degree head!!  The oil is for lubbing and cooling the lower end, not
&gt;&gt;&gt; cooling theend that makes the heat.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks Rick. No argument from me. I have had the VCs off while running
&gt;&gt; (on my 914) and what you say is true, although there was enough 
&gt;&gt; splatter
&gt;&gt; to play hell with my specs and make it hard to see. What you wrote
&gt;&gt; previously made good sense and, along with the trip you described 
&gt;&gt; today,
&gt;&gt; convinced me to ditch the oil cooler idea, and also change my guage
&gt;&gt; order to a tach instead of oil temp, along with an oil pressure 
&gt;&gt; guage. I
&gt;&gt; have a pretty good feel for engine speed, but better to know the revs
&gt;&gt; for sure. The tin, lid and compartment air seals are all in place and 
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; good shape, except a small gap (about 1/4 x 2&quot;) right in the 
&gt;&gt; middle-rear
&gt;&gt; of the main engine air seal. What's the best way to seal that without
&gt;&gt; yanking the engine? Also, I am ordering new Bosch plug wiring with 
&gt;&gt; seals
&gt;&gt; as they are brittle. It does look like I have at least one small tube
&gt;&gt; leak on the right side and lose about 10 or 12 drops overnight, so I'll
&gt;&gt; find and replace that bank before I leave as well.  Any other prep
&gt;&gt; advice you may have would be appreciated.
