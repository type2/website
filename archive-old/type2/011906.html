From: Keith E Martin &lt;vwcampin78_at_juno_dot_com&gt;

Hello list,

My name is Keith Martin and I'm new here.
I just bought a 78 bus for $350 two days ago. It was an automatic that
has been converted to a standard with a 1600cc upright engine in it. It
has it's fair share of rust, being up here in NH and Canada before that.
Having owned a 73 beetle, 63 Baja Bug, and 69 Ghia before, i know a
little about working on VWs..... but this is my first bus, so i need some
help.

My goal is to have a functional bus that i can take on camping trips and
to music festivals. It has just the regular transporter seats right now,
but my friend has the cabinets and folding bed from an early 70's westy
that we are going to install.
It has a solid frame, but quite a bit of surface rust on the bottom and a
few rot holes. I am on a limited budget and have no welding capabilities
i want to know how i can stop the rot and fill in the holes. 
My plan was to sand all the rust and rot and coat it with POR-15, then
pop-rivet sheet metal and cover it with bondo. I know i will never have
show-winning bus and that isn't what i want.
Will this stop the rust? 

Also.. the PO told me the brake booster servo has a vacuum leak, so he
cut and plugged the vacuum line from the engine... i know i need a new
vacuum line, but i don't know much about the braking system. It stops
when you push really hard on the brake pedal.... how would i go about
fixing it? 

Thank you in advance for any advice,
Peace,
Keith
