Subject: Beautiful Vanagon for sale in Tampa, Florida
Message-ID: &lt;0_dot_dec1e18e.253e7890_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a really clean Vanagon for sale if anyone is interested. The van has 
only had two owners.  I purchased it earlier this year to accomidate my new 
Baby and her things.  The original owner is a lawyer.  He purchased the Van 
at Lindell VW in Tampa, Florida and had it serviced there for the past 13 
years.
It's a 1986 seven passenger GL  with the fold down two person bed.
It has a factory VW rebuilt engine with about 40K,  full A/C, AT, power 
windows and locks package, etc.  It is in almost perfect condition.  I have 
recently replaced the master cylinder, front and rear brakes, wheel 
cylinders, front tires, fuel pressure regulator thermostat housing and CV 
joints. The original paint shines  like new and the interior is just as nice. 
 I'm looking to downsize a bit so the van is being offered for sale.  I'm 
asking $3,750 but am open to offers. If you are really looking for a well 
taken care of Vanagon please e-mail me at vwdude1957_at_aol_dot_com.  The only 
problem with the van is a small dent on the sliding door and quarter panel 
edge (no major work). Other than that the Van looks excellent!  If you are 
interested please check out photos at
