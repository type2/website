Hi renoir here.
Speaking of opinions.
The Bentley manual says that the outer bearings on the front wheel hub need
to be
pressed out in order to be replaced.
My question is,
if the bearing pops out very easily by hand, should it be replaced?
There is no sound problems from the wheel but i still pull to the right so i
am grasping at straws. I have switched calipers on either side and replaced
both front hoses.
Van stops straight when braking.
