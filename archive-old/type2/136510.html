Subject: front spare tire/emblem

Hi All.  What's the situation with removing the front spare tire carrier and replacing it with an emblem?  I've removed it but the holes are way too big for the emblem &quot;anchors.&quot;  Is this normal?  Are there some other mounts to use for the emblem in this case or is it not possible to use the same holes?  Please share your knowledge.
Thanks,  Chris   72 Westy
