Subject: Re: [T2] Adapting Nose Panel?

Hi Phil,

That panel has been NLA for a very long time... Back in 1980 my mom had 
a 71 westy that had P.O. collision damage, and it had a 73-79 nose 
panel on it even then.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I have a 72 van that needs the nose replaced. All the replacement 
&gt; panels have the raised logo and the headlight at the top.
