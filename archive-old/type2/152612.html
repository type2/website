Subject: Re: [T2] Starter trouble

I had the same problem on a 73 that sat for about 4 years.  Do not neglect to 
check for tightness/cleaness of connection of the ground strap between the 
frame and the trans.  Previous owner had used a rubber grommet under the nut 
holding the cable to the frame.  Nut was tight, but connection was very bad...
