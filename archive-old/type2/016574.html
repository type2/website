&gt; I am getting some good suggestions to my original question, but here are
&gt; some additional clues to work with:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. I've got blowby. That's why I checked the compression. Engine blows
&gt; out one (old) seal after another at highways speeds. Oil everywhere,
&gt; coating everything, on the final occurance.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Whoever last rebuilt this engine was no expert. Remember, the rotor
&gt; points at #4 cylinder at TDC for cylinder #1.
&gt; 
&gt; So that, combined with the wet/dry difference makes me rule out
&gt; valve/head problems, pray for rings (incompetently installed by PO or his
&gt; rebuilder), and fear a bad piston.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't care except that I am going to have to do a stealth
&gt; drop-and-repair, since working with your hands is against the rules in my
&gt; misbegotten 'neighborhood.'

OK, here's my take.  I suspect the piston is also burnt and will need
replaced.  a set of jugs is fairly cheap, and putting the in is quicker
than rings.  Also, at least lap in the valves on both heads.  If you're
in big financial difficulty, get a used, similar jug for that #4 and
swap it in, but lap the valves, or you you wil probably be sorry because
one will begin to leak and it goes downhill from there.  Valve spring
compressor is cheap to rent/buy and you can do the valves in about 1/2
hour.  You also have a possibility that one or more valves are damaged,
so a couple of spares might be in order.
