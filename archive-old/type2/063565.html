If you're rebuilding, Tom Wilson's book (the one you mentioned) is the
only one I know of with complete rebuild instructions. You'll definitely
want it. If you keep trying, you can find it. It's available from JC
Whipme for something like $13.00. Have fun! Joe

&gt; book or is Muir and Haynes enough?  From what I've heard the book is
&gt; excellent but I can't seem to find it anywhere and would have to wait 6
&gt; weeks for it to be ordered in.  I'm getting the rebuilding 'itch' and don't
&gt; know if I could last six weeks but would like to do a good job and am
&gt; wondering if maybe I should wait.
