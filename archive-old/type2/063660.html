Subject: CV joints/ pentrating oil

The one and only time I did a CV joint, I employed all of the tricks mentioned
thus far. Mainly:  1) Clean out the holes so that the allen wrench really fits
all the way into the hole and 2)using the vice-grips on the outside
simultaneously.  Nothing like a stripped bolt on a key part of your car to get
the adrenelin up.  On the matter of pentrating oil.  I think that liberal
applications of oil over a period of days can get far enough up into the threads
to make a crucial difference.  Sometimes it is just a small improvement which
spells the difference between success and failure.   I spent about a whole
weekend getting a frozen lugnut off on my '69 van.  But that is another story.
