&gt;a 1977 Sunroof Passenger bus.
&gt;price is so low I can't even tell you.

Sure you can, I picked up a '79 deluxe sunroof in california (read rustless) for $150 with motor!

&gt;Here we go with the questions:
&gt;Is the 2.0 FI motor correct for a 77 bus?

yes.

&gt;I have a 1.7 carbed long block in the shed; would that fit the 77 &gt;engine
&gt;compartment?

Yes, you would want the bell housing, clutch, flywheel I believe, from the 72. Basically motor can be any size T4, but use the tranny/clutch equipment to match the exist'g tranny.

&gt;Will the tin, alternator, etc, from the 2.0 fit on the 1.7 long &gt;block?

Most of it would probably, with a few differences. The case size is the same, just piston bore differences.

&gt;Is the 77 transmission an NLA, one year only beast, or are they &gt;readily
&gt;available?

091 tranny from 76-79, list?

&gt;Do I need another bus in my yard?

Yes.

&gt;Do I want another project? I have never dealt with FI before.

FI not scary. Best set up you could have. I'd never get carbs.

&gt;Opinions, conjectures, wise guidance???

Get the bus, deal with problems later. 

Good luck,

Billy
