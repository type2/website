Subject: Re: Winters in the van...a woodstove?!

&gt;I guess a woodstove is a bad idea in the presence of children and
&gt;dogs...

We taught our 2.5 year old son what HOT was when he was 18 months old. The 
dog gets her nose close to something hot and backs off.

Not a bad idea - just got to educate them before they educate themselves 
the painful way...
