Subject: Re: Yet another towing question :-)

&gt;Does anyone think that flat towing a bug behind a
&gt;muscled up bus
&gt;(Schwartzabus?) would work?

Sure, it works great. However, (there's always a
however) when the weight of the towed vehicle
approaches the weight of the bus stopping becomes
kinda scary. I've towed a lot of stuff with my bus
without problems but if it became necessary to stop
quickly I wouldn't be able to! Another issue with a
cammed up bus is gear ratios. The RPM gap between
gears is wide enough that I drop below the power band
after shifting unless I rev it to 5,500 or 6,000 RPM
before shifting. That's no problem except in 3rd.
Sometimes if I have an extra heavy load and am pulling
a little hill or headwind I have to stay in 3rd a
looong time to get on the cam in 4th.
