i took my 151/2 year old neighbor out to to drive at his parents request 1st 
in the jetta then the next couple times in my 69-westy he did great the low 
gearing makes it hard to stall and its somewhat slow, remind him the 
wheelbase is about the same as a beetle it seemed to give him more 
confidence.   mostly have fun
