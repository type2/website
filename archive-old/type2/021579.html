Left if you're laying on your back with your feet sticking out the rear
of the bus.  It's on the right (passenger in the USA) side (FIF) below
the 1-2 cylinders. Remove the push rod tube protective cover that goes
between the heater box and the case and that's where it's *supposed* to
be. 

The connector on the flapper rod moves around 45 deg from full closed to
full open.

BTW, latest news is the type IV thermostat is NLA new. If you can find a
new one, BUY it!

&gt; If you look under engine then cooling air control you'll see the
&gt; illustration you are looking for. The thermostat is under the left lower
&gt; heat channel. Quick check, if the thermostat is puffy when cold then its
&gt; bad. These are sealed and when they heat up they expand (some gas inside,
&gt; air probably good question). When the engine heats up the thermostat gets
&gt; hot and opens then the cable lets the flaps open to allow air to blow via
&gt; the fan.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a 78 Bus I am trying to finish up and get on the road. This is my
&gt; first aircooled having owned several
&gt; water leaking vanagons. I was trying to locate my thermostat and can't
&gt; find it. I looked at the rod connected
&gt; to the flapper where a half in piece of cable is clamped to. I also
&gt; noticed these flappers(what do they do)don't move much.How does this all
&gt; work?Does it help with heating up,keeping the engine cool?Any one have
&gt; pictures of the thermostat set up? I have two new thermostats already.
&gt; What brackets cables do I need?Any info greatly appreciated.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Bill
