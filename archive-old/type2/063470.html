Brett,
  The VDO dipstick sender is an oil temperature sending unit that 
replaces your old dipstick.  Two wires attach to it, and if you leave a 
little extra wire, you can check the oil level as usual without 
disconnecting anything.  The ground wire goes to a convenient ground in 
the engine compartment.  Run the other wire to the gauge up front.  I 
ran mine under the bus, attaching it with zap straps, and I've driven 
for two years without any problems snagging the wire--and many of the miles 
I've done in those two years have been on very rough roads with 
substantial ground clearance considerations.

  As with any sending unit, you must buy a gauge as well.  I have a VDO 
gauge with a range of 120 - 300 degrees F.  As far as accuaracy goes, I 
don't have the facilities to properly evaluate that, but I can say that 
boiling water at sea level read about 212 F when I tested it.  

  The sending unit and gauge is really easy to install.  All you'll need 
is a small screwdriver, a file or something to mark oil levels on the 
dipstick with, enough electrical wire for the job, some electrical 
spade-type connectors to hook everything up, maybe a couple hours to do 
the job at  an un-rushed pace, and a beer or two to keep your 
electrolytes up. 

  Purists will cringe, but I mounted my gauge on the top of the dashboard 
with a single piece of duct-tape.  This performs two vital functions: it 
holds the gauge down securely without drilling any holes in the dash, and 
it looks so good and ugly and *cheap* it will hopefully discourage anyone 
from breaking into the camper to steal stuff.

  I think I paid about CDN$36.00 total for the sender and gauge, 
purchased from Bow-Wow parts in Vancouver, B.C.  (604) 325-9970.  The guy 
I deal with is Shelen (accent on the second syllable).  And yes, that's a 
shameless plug.  :)

  Since I've received a whole bunch of private emails about this, I'm 
making this a general post.
