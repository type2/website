Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel pressure reg test as separate component?

Change of question:

Once the engine is out, I'll just set up an abbreviated fuel ring
through pump, hoses, gauge, and pressure regulator, with jumper clips
from battery to pump (fire extinguisher in standby position!).

So the only question I have now is how to generate adequate vacuum. Can
I do it by sucking through a hose? Would that be enough?


&gt; Testing as part of a complete fuel ring isn't advisable in my engine's 
&gt; current state, and may not be possible.
