Subject: RE: [T2] 1971 Type 2 Engine Recommendations

&gt;But on the other... with a turnkey&gt; I would know that I have parts that go
with the motor and might &quot;perform&gt; better?&quot;

My turn to chime in on this subject.

The 71 is a one year old VW engine as it was the only bus the US got that had
a type 1 dual port. And it was also the only one with disc brakes. I'm unaware
of any turnkey engines that will come with the correct size port for the 71
bus brake booster line that goes all the way up front for the brake servo.

Thus the manifold that came with the 71 buses was a one year old part. You can
take a new intake manifold (aftermarket ones are pretty crappy quality that
I've seen) and tap in a port that you will need for your power brakes. IMO
it's easier to just use your old one (hopefully still in solid shape).

So if you do get a turnkey be sure and explain what you need in advance
otherwise you'll have to pull it apart to tap in the port you need or install
your original manifold. Because you won't be able to just bolt in and run and
still have your disk brakes.

Personally - I would either go with a brand new mexi longblock or get a
rebuilt longblock and use whatever you can from your old heater boxes etc.
