Subject: Re: Bumper Bolts

This happened with my 72.  Yes, there is a nut welded to the inside of the
frame.  I got the biggest drill bit I had, stuck it in my 1/2 inch drill and
drilled a horizontal hole in the frame right where the nut would be.  I think
I drilled two holes side by side.  With the hole I was able to hose the bolt
and nut with penetrating oil, cram a screwdriver in to hold the nut, and
remove the bumper bolt.

&gt; The rear bumper on my 70 westy is mangled badly. I wanted to take the whole
&gt; thing off including the brackets mounted to the frame as they are bent. Two
&gt; of the bolts came off no problem. The other two just turn, turn, turn. Is
&gt; there a nut welded inside the frame that has broken loose? How do you
&gt; suggest I get these bolts out?
