Subject: Heater control cable wanted.
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi volks,
               I've been looking for a replacement heater control cable for a while, now- the one that controls the cab-centre pipe flap that routes air to the defroster vents or the &quot;footwells&quot;- it's used on the later baywindows, early ones just had a lever on the pipe that you can operate with your toe if you stretch a little.
 Does anyone know where I can get one of these? I'm struggling to find a late bay in a scrapyard (around here they're either rolling, under restoration or crushed!) and neither my independant VW flaps nor the dealer can get 'em.
 Anyone got one spare they would post me? I'll swap it for a pint! :-).

Cheers,
              W.
