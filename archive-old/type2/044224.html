&gt; Here's the biggest question...the kicker:
&gt; 
&gt; Can I expect that a type 2 in good running order will make it form my
&gt; temporary home here in Fresno to my house back in DC?  In November?  Or

a type 2 in &quot;good running order&quot; can go just about anywhere.  I drove my
65 across the country and back many years ago and drive my 78 just about
everywhere (BTW I'm in Baltimore so give a call when you get to DC)

&gt; should I just let my little Toyota pickup tow it back?  Or bring the tow bar
&gt; and drive it when it runs- tow it when it doesn't?

I guess it will depend on weather or not it is in &quot;good running order&quot; by
November
