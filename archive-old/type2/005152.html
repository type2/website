&gt;Yes you did answer it.... but......
&gt;Does Porsche group part #'s [when they use VW #'s] = VW #?
&gt;The reason I ask is :  for Porsche # for 2.0L you said it starts 039  but
&gt;the bus 2.0L part # starts with 029. Is this a misprint?

Not a misprint. Parts is parts. Same for the numbers.
021,022,029 is group 4, 039, 043 is 914, but not always.
The problem comes with shared parts. The 1.7L and 1.8L
type 4 and 914 engines are more similar than the 2.0 engines.
Remember the three-bolt intake manifold mount for the 2.0 Porsche
engine ? those heads  have sodium valves, and a relocated spark plug.
The valves in the 2.0 914 are much larger than in the bus 2.0 cylinder head.

A part with a different number is a different part.
However , the difference may be such that a part will
interchange, it depends on the specifics.
the porsche part might only be a change in material.
New part numbers and suffix letters for updates are a
mystery only the guy who made them knows.
