Subject: No Title Westy

Hey Volks,
Im picking up a 1979 Westfalia in Seattle for cheap but the bus has no =
title (long story).  Anyway, the bus is not stolen Ive already checked and =
the process involved in getting a title in this state is Looooong.  The =
bus doesnt even run so I cant even complete the first step involved in =
legally doing it in Washington. =20

So, per the advice of a listmember, I checked the archives and found the =
web address of INternational Title Sevice in New Hampshire.  Which for =
$175 bucks and a couple of forms, I get a Maine registration and license =
plates in 7 to 10 days!!  =20

Has anyone on the list done this before?  Just wondering if you forsee any =
problems with getting it titled and registered in WA.  Maine does not =
require a title to register vehicles over 10 years of age.  The price is =
well worth the worry that my untitled westy could get towed and lost =
forever. =20

Thanks,
Chad Yunge
