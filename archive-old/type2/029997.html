Looks pretty nasty.  My rule is that if I can see tire cord through the
crack, the tire is toast.  I couldn't see any in your pictures, but
you'll have to do a visual inspection to be sure.

Since the tires were swap meet fodder, I suppose that you might have
gotten a pair that have been on a shelf for a few years.  Tires do age
even if they aren't run!

&gt; looking cracks in them.  Pictures here:
