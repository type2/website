Subject: RE: [T2] Re: if you were/are a mechanic,

I'm a VW mechanic and fanatic, and often have to watch from crossing the
line between business and hobby...

I often take calls at work. If someone buys parts from us, is doing
their own work, and can't remember which wire went where in the engine
compartment, I'll try to help them out. If someone just bought a project
and wants me to coach them over the phone while they try to figure out
how to get it back on the road, I advise them to either have it towed to
the shop, or buy a book from us. I can't spend all danged day on the
phone explaining how a VW works to someone who doesn't know the business
end of a screwdriver.

Often, people ask me if I do work on the side (for money). Nope. This
takes business away from the place I work. If you want me to turn a
wrench for you, bring your VW to the place I work, so I can keep my job.
Maybe someday I'll work on my own, and I'll have to charge you enough so
that I can stock parts, pay Uncle Sam and the insurance guys off, pay
the light and phone bills, hire an accountant, buy all the special
tools... pay the rent, feed the kids, etc. Get the idea?

I do have friends that I help out when I can, on my own time. They also
help me out with my own projects, invite me to dinner, call just to see
how I'm doing, etc. They want to do their own work, and I let them turn
the wrench while I watch, enjoying their company, sipping my beer.

Business is for the money, pleasure is for the fun. If it's not fun, and
I'm not making money, I'm not gonna do it.
