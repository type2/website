The campground dictator said:
&gt; &gt; We discourage trespassing.  Your friend entered the campground when the
&gt; gate
&gt; &gt; was closed, at night.  He was told that we were closed because we had
&gt; water
&gt; &gt; problems.  He was not happy about it but he did leave. I guess that VW
van
&gt; &gt; camper money is just as green as anyone else's.  Bob

Ok first off, just as I said the gate was half open, I did not have to get
out of the bus to drive in. As soon as I saw the office was closed and there
were no instructions for late visiters I turned around, I was not 25 ft from
the exit gate when he stopped me.  The only way I could go would be to exit
as there was not a turn off.   He did not tell me about any water problems
just that I had to leave.

And as I said before there were people in the campground.  RV's everywhere.
So I guess they were just closed to me.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
