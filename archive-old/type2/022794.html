I would have to disagree on a couple of facts.  The glass seal/leaking 
problem is more than likely related to the glass. 
I had to purchase a replacement glass for my 69 type II.  I purchased a PPG 
brand replacement glass, compared it to the original glass that I still had 
and the size was correct.  I did need to trim the laminate that had oozed out 
&gt;from the center of the glass to get the WCM seal to fit correctly.  I 
installed by my self with silicone lube and it fits perfectly, other than the 
ugly PPG logo you could never tell it was non-OEM.  I have had the glass in 
for over a year and have never had a drop of water leak.  I have several 
other vw's, all with WCM seals and I have NEVER! had one leak unless there 
was a problem with the install and or glass. 

I am in the auto body repair business.  I have had experience with many glass 
shops.  Safelite is one of the low budget, market to insurance companies, 
glass shops that do not employ qualified installers.  This is obvious by the 
fact that the guy tried to correct the leaking seal by gluing/sealing with 
urethane sealer.  This glass was never designed to be installed with 
urethane.  At this point, you need to replace the seal and I would closely 
inspect the glass also.
