Subject: 4 Brand new Bosch Bus Oil Filters - Trade or Buy?

Recently I had a Dansk heater box installed in my 75 campmobile and this
was slightly different then the original.  So I have had to switch to the
Rabbit/Golf oil filter.  If anyone would be interested in these for $3 a
piece  and postage or trade I will send them out.  Also I am looking for the
a replacement for the white plastic piece in the rear by the back cabinet
and attached to the roof for a 75 westfalia. This covers up the rear
hatch hinges. I have one that is in good shape but I am installing the
upper cabinet from a 76.in my 75  I would like find a replacement to cut
up so that the upper cabinet sits flush with the front of the back left
clothes closet.  Also this has the snaps for the back bug screen. I would
still like to keep all original equipment just in case I become rich and can
show my van. If someone has this piece and is not interested in these oil
filters let me know a price.
