&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;seems to be in the ballpark for the circa 2L engine under these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;conditions.  Cheers, Art McGinn

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can that be true?  I don't have any first-hand experience with that model,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but that kind of fuel consumption seems excessive for ANY two-liter four-cyl.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ain
&gt; 
&gt; Most all well tuned 2L air cooled I have driven got 17-21 religiously in a
&gt; city weighted mix of city/highway in rather hilly Morgantown WV.  These were
&gt; in predominantly late 2L bus Westies, a fair match for the weight of a regular
&gt; Vanagon.  The '81 Westy I just drove back on a wing and a prayer of an afternoon
&gt; engine rebuild still got 20 mpg on the interstate back, but this was on intersate
&gt; with some pretty massive grades.  Personally I feel anything under 15 mpg out
&gt; of a 2L air cooled means trouble somewhere.  It has always in fact amazed me that
&gt; the late T4 powered van and the Wasserboxers seem nearly immune to driving
&gt; conditions affecting mileage in WV &quot;the Mountain State&quot;.  As a rule my mileage
&gt; never fluctuates in a van more than 2-3 mpg around 20 mpg, regardless of the city
&gt; highway mix if the engine is in good shape tuned and running correctly.  Just my 
&gt; opinions.  This said we'll see how the rebuild for the '81 does after I get it in
&gt; this week.
