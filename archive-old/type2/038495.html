 &lt;&lt; Do you mean the spring with the washer-like retainer that turns through 90
  degrees on a pin?  You should have those.  They don't come with the shoes
  though, you have to buy a separate fitting kit. &gt;
 
 Yes, those are the springs i am refering to, and i did buy the kit and 
therefore have them. However the old brakes did not have them on, and 
moreover, there are not any holes drilled in the backing plate to put these 
springs to use if i wanted to use them. That was me diliema :)
