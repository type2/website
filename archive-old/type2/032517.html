Looking at the Haynes manual (pre 71 bus), they say &quot;support the gearbox when pulling the engine&quot;, this is accompanied by a picture of the bellhousing supported with a big chain and a block of wood. My 72 has the rear mounts for the gearbox which I find handy. For those without rear mounts in the early busses would it be possible to fit the gearbox support bracket found on later busses to the front engine support frame in an early bus. Having not seen the early bus support frame I could not be sure that it would fit but looking at the way this gearbox rear mounting bracket is made and attached I would guess that it may be a modification that could be made to the early busses. Don't forget you early bus owners, that you have a removable rear section to your engine bay which means that you don't need to lift your bus when dragging the engine out, and it makes access to the engine bay easier. Incidentally, anyone done a mod to a late bus to make the rear section removable??
