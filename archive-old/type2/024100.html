I haven't quite figured out the part numbers either.  My T4 book has a number 
at the bottom of the page, and then one or two digit numbers listed next to 
each part.  I have thought that you just add the digit to the end of the part 
number at the bottom of the page, but I have never tried to compare this with 
the dealer to see if I'm correct.

In the front of this catalog is an order form.  The information requested is 
as follows:
Type____
Chassis No./Engine No. ______
Year of issue of catalog 19__ (this is listed on the front of the catalog)
Illustration No. _______
Key No. ___
left.__
right__
Ex-change__
Remarks (color, size)__
Qty.___
Part Number_____

I don't believe these catalogs were intended for the US market.  Mine 
includes English translations, but lists this for Great Britain and not the 
US.

If anyone is successful in ordering one of these parts catalogs, please let 
us know how it works out and how much it costs.
