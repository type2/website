Subject: bubbles in fuel filter

  O.k.  I am pretty covinced that the fuel in my oil is being caused by a 
combination of ruptured fuel pump diaphram, and lots of short trip driving.  
I am also experiencing bubbles in my fuel line.  I have seen this before on 
another I owned, but I replaced the fuel pump with a used one, and still had 
the same symptoms.  I know some fuel will evaporate when at operating temp, 
but...  My drive to work is under a mile, and I bet I do not drive it more 
than 10 a week.  Could these bubles be air coming through the diaphram from 
the crankcase?  Any advice on this?         Bus Gypsy
