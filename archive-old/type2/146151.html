Subject: Re: [T2] dash conditioning

In a message dated 2/27/06 4:05:42 PM, guthrie_at_broadcom_dot_com writes:


&gt; After searching for a while, I found a uncracked dash for the bus on samba
&gt; that meets my standards, I'm kinda picky I guess.
&gt; Does anyone have something they swear by that will condition it and help
&gt; prevent, instead of premote, the cracking?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Tom
&gt; 
Other than a dash cover that will prevent UV degradation...No.
