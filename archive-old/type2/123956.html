Subject: VW syncros

At EB2004 I saw a really cool Syncro that had roll bars all over, rifle
drawers, and all kinds of unique features. I have since become interested in
finding if VW made diesel Syncros. I can't find any confirmation of that
despite perusing www.syncro_dot_org as well as the vanagon list.
Lil' help? Point me in the right direction please!
