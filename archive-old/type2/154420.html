&gt;&gt; Yes, what you saw was a 49 to early 55 bus. And no, it is NOT called a
&gt; barn door bus because of the side
&gt;&gt; doors. Here is the correct definition of a true barn door bus, courtesy 
&gt;&gt; of
&gt; vintagebus_dot_com:

Many years ago, before I knew the definition of Barn Door Bus.. circa 
1980... i took pictures of a bus..

I wish I could go back and look at it again.. to answer questions ,, but I 
can't .. I have no idea where it went.

my Guess.. a late barn door?  1954.. as it has pivots on the door vent 
windows.. not piano hinges,, but hey,, what do *I* know!

the pictures shows... 
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/pictures/2172.jpg

typical Barn Door features on the windshield ,, no overhang...
pressed bumpers

strange ,, shorter than normal  &quot;Barn Door&quot;   with VENTS
no vents in the body..

tail lights,, well anything could have happened over the years on them...

and there is a roof hatch of some sort.

anything else.??

btw,, I took this picture,, then lost a hard drive,, but I had loaded it to 
vintagebus.. so I was able to get it back...
that is why it has vintagebus watermark
