Subject: [T2]Push rod seal and valves
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi Volks,

Thanks to this list I've found the &quot;how to&quot; on changing a push rod seal.
While I'm at it I want to adjust the valves. My question is do I need a
torque wrencch for this? I can't seem to find mine at the moment.
My bus is a '72 Westy with a carbed 1800.

Thanks Ahead for your help.
