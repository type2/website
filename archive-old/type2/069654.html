Surfer Bob asks:
&gt;
&gt;Hey Lee, does your bus run cooler now? I haven't driven far enough to notice
&gt;yet with mine. Any power or mileage changes?

It sure does run cooler.  Kind of hard to say exactly, what with changing
weather and all, but overall, I'd say that oil temperatures (measured in
the sump with a VDO gauge setup) average about 20 degrees cooler.  I have
made no other changes on the engine that might have effected the running
temperatures.

I seem to have a little more pep.  But then, &quot;pep&quot; is a relative thing in
an aircooled Westy.  And I might just be feeling better about the
temperatures and willing to push the engine a little harder.

I haven't noticed much of a change in fuel mileage, though.
