Subject: What Should it cost?

I have a '79 Westy with a 2.0 FI, etc.  I bought it about 2 years ago and
it's running pretty good.  However, the tranny is in need of major repair.
Popping out of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.  So, what kind of tranny should I get for
that year, engine, etc?  What's the going price?  Where?  Thanks.
