Air intake sensor??

I have no idea why Bentley calls it that.....everyone else calls it an 'air
flow meter'.  Good used ones show up once in a while but you probably want a
rebuilt one from Bus Depot or Bus Boys. Part # 0 280 200 020 [0 280 200 018
will work, it subs to the 020].


&gt; Well, at long last the bugs are worked out but one for Lilli-Marlene.
&gt; She runs well, and the new clutch makes driving a dream! The last hurdle
is
&gt; the Air Intake Sensor which is in need of replacement. If anyone has one
out
&gt; there for sale let me know. I'll gladly pay shipping if the part is
&gt; certified as working (i.e.&quot;good&quot;)
