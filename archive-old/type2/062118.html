Subject: Westy interior replacement

Lisa Quinn and Jeffery Carver were discussing Westy interior replacement
options during or after the typical &quot;Bad Wallpaper effect&quot; occurs.

Vanbondo took ownership of his '83 Westy in great shape excepting the
wallpaper effect. It was too far gone in our case. We sadly ripped all of
the hanging &quot;wallpaper&quot; out of the vehicle. After doing the wood in the '67
westy rfh, I plan on replacing the exposed glue panels in the '83 with the
same kind of white Baltic birch 1/8&quot; wood. Golden Oak stain and
Poly~varnish. I think though that I will just wait until winter and until
the RFH is on the road. I don't care if it isn't stock in the 83.
