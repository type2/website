Well, I had to take off the heads on the 2.0 Liter FI engine I recently bought...just to remove the rusted-on exhaust. I'm going to have to do some work on these heads (or have someone else do it) because of studs that broke off as exhaust was removed, a stripped plug hole, etc.

I've been this road before with AE and H case engines, though never a Type 4. Here I am in the thick of things, thinking &quot;Well, here I am. Now how much further should I go?&quot;

The guy I got this engine from did a compression test before I got it. It was running about 125 on all cylinders. He bought it to put into something else, so this isn't an engine he had run for any length of time; just something he picked up for himself and then passed on to me cause I needed one.

It's got to be one of the greasiest, dirtiest engines I've ever seen. About half of the oil cooler fins are covered (blocked) in grease. All kinds of crap all over the place restricting air flow. I MUST clean this up...otherwise, I wouldn't be able to tell where it was leaking from when it leaked later on. There's no way I'd put this in my bus without replacing the main seal and the oil cooler seals...and I'm thinking Type 4s have another back by the fan?;

I'm at the point now where I'm thinking about going all the way, splitting the case and cleaning that up; measuring all the tolerances, etc., etc., hoping for the best...reacting to what I learn.

The oil that came out of the case smelled a little of gas and had some grit in the bottom of it. I'm just wondering how much has been worn on the inside of this thing. I'm thinking it will mostly cost me time to check it out and then at least I'll know.

To Hone or Not to Hone...that is the question! Since the compression was up around 125, I'm thinking maybe I'd be better off just pulling the cylinders and pistons as sets and not bothering to pull the pistons out of the cylinders. At $300+ a set, I'm considering not replacing them. But should I go ahead and pull them and replace the rings? The piston walls are nice and glossy, like mirrors. I don't see any obvious wear on them, but there ain't no cross-hatching either.

I broke one of the fins off of the #3 cylinder when I pulled it off. I'm thinking maybe I'll mig/tack that sucker back on there. It's in a good spot for such a trick if the heat won't cause worse problems. Thoughts?

One more thing...I've got a gasket set for an 1800 that I got in a box of stuff I bought at an auction. It's missing something, I think, but I'm not sure what. How close are the sets for a 2000 and an 1800? Could I buy the parts that are different a-la-carte? No sense in tossing $70 into something if I already got all but $10 of it in another set.

Thanks for all your help!

BTW, that fan came right off once I knew I could wack it carefully with a hammer; it was bound on the fan shroud, but I had to get the fan off to get the nuts off the back of the shroud.

Thanks! Joe
