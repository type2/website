These questions will really expose my ignorance but here goes.....

.....the whole story: I went up to the Ennis show last weekend in my '70
SC and had a great time, until.... The engine ran great all the way up
there, camping
out was fun, and the show was great. Unfortunately on the way back my engine
died!!! Just about 30 miles south of  Waxahachie, right in the middle of
nowhere on I35
with me and my two boys!!! What a drag. Thank the good Lord for mobile
phones. Fortunately
for us, people stopped and tied to help but to no avail. The really nice
thing was that Paul and
the crew were behind us in the RV and we were able to catch a ride with
them. The SC had to be towed back to Austin.

Anyway here is where I am now. I always thought the SC needed some extra
umph, so I just happened to find a 1776 engine, turnkey (at a pretty good
price, rebuilt). It turns out to have a dual barrel carb. It is a solex,
made in Italy. (Can anyone tell me exactly what that is?). The manifold is a
dual throat. I actually didn't realize this when I bought it. Well, after I
asked the question the other day about the brake booster vacuum, I found an
intake manifold for a '71 bus and, low and behold, look what kind of carb I
have, no way the '71 manifold will work with that carb, duh. And because my
engine needs the extra fuel I don't want to go back to a smaller carb. So
back to the original question, HOW MUCH WILL MY BRAKE PERFORMANCE BE REDUCED
BY DISABLING THE BRAKE BOOSTER? WILL DISABLING THE BOOSTER MESS UP THE
BOOSTER IF I WANT TO USE IT LATER? I am afraid that drawing vacuum off the
particular set up I now have will impair performance, or totally screw it up
(but really, I have no idea what would happen!).

Now for another stupid question. Can you put a late model beetle 1600DP case
in a 1970 SC? I didn't know about the type 2 rear cross member engine mount
that bolts to the rear of the case on the 1600 SP that is in the SC now. The
mounting holes appear to be on the case of the 1776 motor but they are
filled or plugged off. Additionally, the 1776 has a full flow oil filter,
incompatible with that rear engine mounting cross member!! Is there anyway I
can make this configuration work? I'm afraid I've gone and bought an engine
I won't be able to use. I really wanted to install this engine as is so I
can rebuild my 1600 SP that was in there at a leisurly pace and then have a
spare engine.

Now that you all know how stupid I really am, can anyone PLEASE help????

Also if by some miracle I can actually get this to work without having to
drag it all down to the mechanic, what size clutch should I use? I'm
thinking I will have to use the 200mm pressure plate and disc and then the
throw out bearing for the 1970 tranny? Does that make any sense?

Nervously awaiting any and all replies. TIA,
