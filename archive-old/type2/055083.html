Subject: Side Door Problems

Short story:  My side door is stuck.

Long story:  I had locked the door and one of my coworkers was trying to get
in
and kept working the handle (he may be a bit slow) and now I can not open
the door.

I don't think it's the lock, I can lock/unlock the door from the outside.
But from the
inside, I have to manipulate the handle a bit before I can get it to lock
and unlock.
I also checked the archives for stuff about the lock and nothing there
seemed to
trigger the light bulb in my head.

It hasn't been too fun trying to get at the lock or the interior door
mechanisms because
it's closed.  So if there are no general suggestions to how to fix the door.
Is it
possible to remove the door somehow without it being open first?

Thanks!
skinny
