&gt; Well, I went out to my local Bus Yard to get some parts the other day, and a

&gt; &quot;parts&quot; (I don't know what that means)  Another company is coming from Mexico
&gt; to take all the Bug doors.  Then, breath deep, they are going to crush all of
&gt; the busses and cars, about 300 altogether.

Aaaughhhh ... Stop the Insanity!

Quick!  We need to organize some sort of rescue mission.  We'll need 
tow-vehicles, trailers, a large field nearby to move them to until the 
adoptions can be set up, cash (lots of cash) ... oh, the Horror ... :-0

I need to go lie down for a while. :(

Wait!  I've got one vacation day left ... hmmm ...

Where is this place?  (I used to know this)
