&gt; Oil pressure cannot be a &quot;set in stone&quot; specification, even on a factory
&gt; engine.

VW does have a published spec for oil pressure.
&gt;From WOG 1960-1970
SAE 30 / 70c / 2500 RPM   42psi (new) 28psi (wear limit).
There must be a similar spec for a T4 but I dont have it.
Point being it is a 'set in stone specification&quot;.
BUT (lets talk about your big butt) there is no published spec for Idle
oil pressure hot or otherwise which has been somewhat the topic of
conversation.
