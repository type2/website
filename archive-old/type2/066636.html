Hi Kath.

What year is your bus? I installed retractable lap/shoulder belts in the front
of my '72 and they're fantastic. And they bolt right into the existing holes.
They are JS Whitney part #'s 12FA6244U (black), 14FA5083N (tan), 14FA5244T
(navy), 13FA5211T (red), 14FA5200N (maroon), and 14FA5115N (silver/gray). Ready
for the price? $97.99 EACH. But worth every penny IMHO. They are very modern and
easy to use, and they come with a long stiff female end that attaches to the
side of the wheel well and stays up off the floor just like the originals.
Matter of fact, the entire installation goes just like stock. And they look like
they belong there. I've had mine for about three years now. I'll be happy to
answer any additional questions about them 

Usual disclaimers.....
