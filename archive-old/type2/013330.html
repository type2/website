&gt;shoulder. It is designed to shear the head off when you tighten it, making
&gt;it 'tamper-proof'. It is not really soft, it just has a designed weak spot.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is the tamper proof bolt really
&gt;&gt; a shear bolt? Is that why it's so soft?

NO, the point of these bolts is NOT to be tamper proof.  Bill assumes
correctly, those bolts are designed to shear at a particular torque to
provide a particular clamping force.  They are not &quot;soft&quot; per say, just
turned down like they are they carry a very accurate torque and shear.
Prior to their &quot;invention&quot; the column was suspended with a number of
nylon washers and the bolts had very narrow torque specifications
(this in '73ish era I think with the one year? column support.)  With the
invention of the shear bolts all those stupid washers that had to be
in all the correct locations with correctly torqued bolts ceased.  Those
bolts are integral to how and when your column collapses in a front
impact and need to be replaced with the correct parts, furthermore they
are available and are cheap.  I think RMMW even has the things for
nothing essentially.

USE THE RIGHT PARTS.  You got very little in front of you and you
don't want a steering wheel as part of your chest.

Sorry I've meant to nip this one before when people asked, can I just
use a....
