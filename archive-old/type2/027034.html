Subject: Brakes work but handbrake doesn't (on one side)??

Just missed my inspection on acct of the handbrake not meeting the spec on 
my 75 bus.  The right rear hand brake does not engage (though works fine on 
the left side) and the brakes generally work great all around.

I'm still looking for a 36mm socket to get a look at the brakes on the side 
where they are failing, but wondered if anyone else has run into this same 
problem.  Parts needed?  Workaround?  Thanks in advance.
