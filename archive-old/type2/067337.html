Subject: The NEW VW Bus enthusiast....

Hey folks,
        I just thought I'd ramble a little about owning and restoring a VW bus
in the mid 90's.  I didn't own a VW bus in the prime time of VW, the
60's and early 70's; heck, I was just born in '71!  I did get to grow up
with two brothers that could only afford VW's, and lots of them, so I
would call myself lucky.  And here it is now, 1996, and I'm working on
my restoration again after 6 years of life passing.  But what's
different now from when my father or brothers (9 years older) would have
been restoring a VW Bus?  Well....VW no longer has MOST of the parts I
need.  All the buses are old, just like the 57 chevys before them.  I
now face the same dilema as American restorations have seen for a very
long time.  But how do I beat the system?  How can I do just as good a
job restoring a car as my brothers or father?  I use technology... old
Ma Bell couldn't lay a finger on the information I have access to. 
Sure, I still use the telephone to make an order with a company that is
a little slow and behind the times, or to talk to someone in person (a
very handy thing to use to know EXACTLY who you are dealing with).  But,
when I want information, I surf.  I would say I have gotten 1/2 the
amount of information I have since gathered for restoring my bus while
connected to the internet.  The rest is from going to VW shows for the
past 8 years (as a fan and later as an owner...).

I just want to thank all the people that contribute to this listserve. 
The experts we have online are allowing the rest of us to stay afloat. 
We no longer have many VW dealers that we can walk into and say &quot;you
know that little tube that connects my windshield washer fluid container
to my spare tire....&quot;, they just look at you funny and have you peruse
their micro fiche. (that's just a sign of the times)  But we have this
list to turn to.  I'm amazed at the honesty shown on this list...people
don't want to answer unless they know for sure, or start off with a nice
little liability removal statement...

Keep up the excellent work!
