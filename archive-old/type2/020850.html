Subject: Gettin Hitched

For the past few summers I've been spending some time at some of the 
lakes around here once in a while.  I always see people out and about 
having fun ON the lake, and think how much fun it is.  So, I'm thinking 
about getting a jet-ski (waverunner to be more precise) and having some 
fun with it this summer.  After all, I live only a few blocks from the 
lake, and theres a river that goes through town here that would be fun 
to rip around on, not to mention the good number of surrounding lakes 
and what not.  Not to mention the river right by the site of Buses 
Nowhere Near the Arch!  But to get to these places with it, I will have 
to tow it.  I think that a bus can handle a jet ski without a problem.  
I mean, a motorcylce could even tow one.  You could probably put one 
behind your bicycle.  Would a westy hitch be suitable for this?  Are 
early bay (71) and split (62) hitches interchangable?  Would anyone have 
a hitch they want to get rid of?  I'm not wanting to hack bumpers or 
anything like that.  I'm just looking for something more &quot;bolt on.&quot;
Has anyone ever done this before?  Results?

Thanks!
Isaiah
