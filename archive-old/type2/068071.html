glad you have a winder for the bdoor.

When I was an undergraduate in 1962 I had a 1932 Austin that had a winder
permantly fixed in the front, and I used to provide endless amusement to all
and sundry by cranking in regularly. BTW make sure your ignition is not
ovre-advanced or it will kick back maybe breaking your thumb. I have unfond
memories of it backfiring if I did not retard it properly.  My Austin 7 had a
manual advance-retard on the steering column to avoid this problem and the
old motorcycles (Vincent black shadow, 1000 c V twin) had exhaust valve
lifters to allow 140 lb people to kick start them.
