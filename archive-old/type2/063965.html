Mike Peebles asked about a bra for his '76.

I'm looking for one, too, for my '81 Westy.  I know just what I want -- the
brand name is Colgan.  But I can't find anybody who sells it!  Can one of
you listmembers point me to a dealer?  Either mailorder or in the Bay Area
(preferably).

Thanks,

 Lee Wood

'81 Westfalia &quot;CampoFelice&quot; (fourth in a long line -- '68, '71 &amp; '76)
 I can sleep in my car, but I can't _drive_ my house!
