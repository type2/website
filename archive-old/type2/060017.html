&gt; that has the two upper legs that go into each end of the vacuum hose and
&gt; then a smaller leg just went out into the open air.

My '75 stick shift also had this (or a similar?) little 'T' connection. (it
was more of a &quot;Y&quot; in my case).

The main line was the main servo vacuum hose, and the smaller line off it went
to a really strange device that was screwed into the engine case. (it was
about half an inch cubed). I had no Idea what it was for, and the '78 engine I
was putting into the van didn't have this little doodad anyway.

-so I just blocked it off and have had no noticeable problems since then.

I still don't know what it was supposed to do!
