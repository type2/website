Subject: Re: [T2] Beating of a dead horse!

Ok, here's what I did with that combo:

I swapped out the dizzy for an SVDA unit...

...but before I did that, here's how I timed the
009/34-PICT-3 combo:

I timed it at idle to 7.5 degrees BTDC at idle. Then I
took my timing analyzer, dialed it in at 30 degrees
advance, and timed it at 3,000 RPMS. Car ran great,
and the hesitation was fairly minimal.

&gt; extensive archive research and much list
&gt; conversation on this subject, I just want a GENERAL
&gt; CONSENSUS of where bus owners who run this combo set
&gt; their timing, I don't necessarily want the correct
&gt; answer, just what individual people are doing so I
&gt; can make my own judgement. I know, I know, bigger
&gt; jets, etc.  BUT assuming I do NOT what to change
&gt; carb jets, and that I want to keep this combo in my
&gt; bus, and that the engine is a 1600 DP, and that
&gt; Elvis REALLY is the King, where would you set YOUR
&gt; timing? I apologize for the thorough punishment and
&gt; running into the ground of this subject, but I have
&gt; read and heard so many diiferent ideas that are
&gt; &quot;BEST&quot;, I just want to know what people who have
&gt; this set up ACTUALLY do.
