Subject: Fuel Filter question, re-usable

Hey Y'all,
Happy Friday.  While picking up brakes for my 71 Westy, I saw and bought a re-usable fuel filter made by BugPack.  It's the glass kind with the replaceable screen inside. My question: Has anyone used these, and if so, do they leak or clog easily?? Adversely, do they filter finely enough?


Peace, John Baker
