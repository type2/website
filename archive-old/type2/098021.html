Subject: Re: [T2] Ring compressor shortcut?

&gt;Anyone got a easy, fast, shortcut for a ring compressor
&gt;aside from buying one

Y'know, I'd answer as Bob and Dave did (and their suggestions are
certainly valid!), but I can hear the followup post coming all the way
back in time from Monday... &quot;Does anyone have a single 1.7/1.8/2.0 piston
and cylinder they would like to sell?&quot;  The Bugpack 7030 ring compressor
is never more than $10 and usually less than $5 at any VWFLAPS.  I believe
you are betting $300-400 vs. saving $5 and the risk/reward ratio is too
high for me.
