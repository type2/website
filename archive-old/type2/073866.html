Who started this thread?

I got the old 81 Westfalia Air Cooled running today and it took a thirty
minutes for the
lifters and everything to settle in before it stopped sounding like a
thrashing machine. 
I got all kinds of weird no-indicatioin on test for injector, cold start
injector, temp sensor and AFM checks and apparently my cursing was at a
frequency that caused two finely tuned and unnamed connectors to mate up.
It now sits and idles and only semi-thrashes.
I swapped out about every part on the FI and I won out by replacing no
parts----- I just wore down its resistance I guess or scratched enough
corrosion off of a connector to make good contact.
After a the van had a three year rest I'm just glad I didn't get a van
with
a bad head or a pair of them.
I drove it back and forth in the drive and the clutch appears to be good.
The test is tomorrow when I take it to the 50 cent car wash and vacuum
out the dog hair, spray down the canvas and hit the inside fender wells
with a lick and a promise.
