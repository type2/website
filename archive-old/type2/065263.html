Subject: Heater Valves.

The heater valves on my '77 westy are all rusted out and my heat exchanger
are in really good shape.  I have been running with the heat exchangers
unhooked all summer but it is starting to get cold here in western NY.
I considered getting new heater valves but for over $100 a pair, well lets
just say I have other things I need the money for.
So &quot;would&quot; this work?  What I mean is will I damage anything on my bus by
doing this?  I would like to connect the heat exchangers to the large 
heater channels dirrectly with some of that flexible aluminum/wire reinforced
ducting?  This way all winter I will have full heat, and then disconnect it 
again come summer.  I really don't mind full heat, I still have the cold air
control and the lever which allow the heat to go certain places.  Plus my bus
has never been one to overwarm anyone anyway.  I also forgot to mention my
heater valve control cable are both broken so there is so more money I will
be saving.
Any ideas/ suggestions?
