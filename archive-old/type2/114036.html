Subject: Who's building a garage?

Could anyone that is building a garage or has recently built a separate 
garage contact me p-mail?

I am considering a project like that and seeking estimates of the cost 
(materials, labor, etc.).

I especially like the one that somebody posted with a pic of their U-haul 
truck today. Didn't catch the sender's name as I was in a rush...

I'm seeking to add a garage just like his - whoever he is.
