Subject: RE: [T2] Clutch Installation Question - Help Needed

  Right, the clutch pedal pushes the bearing into the ring then continues to
push the entire ass. Toward the engine case.

&gt;Bob, did you remove the clips ? There are clips  (3?) that hold the

Yes, I removed the &quot;staples&quot;.
I think the &quot;new&quot; clutch I got is not right, and I may have to put the old
one back in. :-(

It seems to my mind that the release ring and the release levers would
normally be loaded / nest AWAY from the clutch plate, and the release
bearing then pushes them inward during gear changing.

Damn !
