Subject: Bad ignition switch?
Message-ID: &lt;372D18FA.8E95D41C_at_northnet_dot_org&gt;

Hello all,

        Thanks the previous &quot;words of wisdom&quot;. I'm still having problems
though. Just to recap, I have a bus that everything that requires the
key to be in the on position does not work. Right now my emergency,
interior, and running lights work, but the radio, headlights, idiot
lights, and obviously starter, do not. How do I go about testing if the
switch went bad, or if there is a bad wire somewhere. I have figured out
that there is juice getting to it. This bus is my first big project, and
I know next to nothing about wiring. It has been fairly simple, but also
a big headache. I also can't find the right diagram, the one on the type
2 site has a fan, and my bus doesn't. Any advice?

Thanks,
Nathaniel
