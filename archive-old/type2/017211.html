&gt;Shouldn't the heater fan be mounted
&gt;right above the engine with tubes
&gt;running down to where the heat
&gt;exchangers used to live ???

Yes.  The supplementary electric blower is hung from a bracket above the
engine, and is factory-wired with an in-line fuse holder.

Without any heat exchangers, the blower won't do any good anyhow.

On the forward ends of the heat exchangers there would have been a short
piece of duct that connected to a heat control box (one on each side)
which connected to the ducts that take the warm air forward.

As a '78, it would also have had warm air exhaust pipes.  That is, when
the heat control box flap valves were closed, the warm air that would
otherwise be ducted forward would instead be directed through flexible
corrugated aluminum tubing to a rigid pipe that carried the unwanted
warm air to be dumped aft of the engine, just forward of the bumper.
