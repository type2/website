Subject: conditioning balljoint boots

Richard,
When I replaced all my window rubbers I asked the same question of WCM,
Wolfsburg west, and RMMW. All recommended to use nothing, or Zymol if you want
to use something.
I'm not sure if the boots are the same rubber as used for windows though?
Personally though, I can't say I'm happy with Zymol.
Richard,
Brisbane Australia
