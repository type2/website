&gt;Adapters are never a good idea.  Better to get wheels that fit.

I agree and i disagree with the above. 

The disadvantages of using adaptors are clear, added weight, more parts, 
often poor quality. 

As for mounting Fuchs on a Baywindow, there is no substitute to a Porsche 
alloy, they are are of very good quality, a -lot- lighter than any wheel 
around, and it's a Porsche wheel. There are many repro Porsche wheels 
available even with different bolt patterns, but they are always much 
heavier.

If you're mounting a set of the narrower Fuchs, you will find that if 
you drill, weld and tap hubs/drums/discs the track becomes narrower. 
I have 4.5x15 Fuchs on my '73 single cab, and i didn't like the use of 
adaptors, so i welded, drilled and tapped the hubs and brake parts, 
and found the track was too narrow, the wheel would sit much deeper 
into the body work than the stock wheel. The solution here is to use 
the aluminum adaptors on the stock bolts. They are available in Germany 
(i'm in The Netherlands) they will restore trackwidth, and and solve 
the bolt pattern problem at the same time, they are the same as the 
wheel spacers that are used on many 993, 996 and earlier Porsche's, 
except that the inside bolt pattern is 5x112 and fits on a Bus. Also 
when mounting 17&quot; Porsche Cup wheels on a Eurovan you'll need these 
adaptors. I've even seen Busses with Porsche brakes that needed spacers, 
only to bring the track near where it was stock. Many Bugs in Germany 
run Porsche wheels, mostly the 17&quot; Cup wheels, often they already have 
the 5x130 Porsche bolt pattern and still use spacers, many Kafer Cup 
(Bug Cup in Germany) cars use this combination. 

The German adaptors do not add too much weight to the unsprung and 
rotating mass, take into account that the Porsche wheel is very light 
to begin with, you can use the original wheels nuts to attach the 
adaptors to the vehicle, and use Eurovan (701 601 139 B) bolts to mount 
the wheels if you have tapped adaptors, or use the original Porsche 
magnesium nuts to mount the wheels, try to get the Porsche nuts with 
the wheels, they cost $15 each if you have to buy them later. 
You can either carry the stock Bus spare or a Porsche one. 

To recap,

Avoid using adaptors if you can, but if you really want Porsche 
wheels for your Bus, the aluminum adaptors are a good way to do so. 
I wouldn't mount aftermarket Mercedes alloy wheels as they are 
significantly heavier than Porsche wheels with adaptors, the stock 
steel wheels are much better/lighter than the expensive aftermarket 
alloys. 

I hope it helps, these are just my personal thoughts and experiences. 

Brian.
