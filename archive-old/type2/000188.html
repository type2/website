Dear Volks,

I wrote a couple of weeks ago asking if anyone knew a source for orange plaid 
Westy cloth.  Brad Clausen sent me the name of a guy in Ohio at Der Wagen 
Works.  I called and he has plenty of orange cloth EXCEPT for the pattern I 
need, which is the orange cloth with green, gold and black.   He said his 
material is orange with gold but no green.  My Westy is a '75.  FWIW if you 
have the other kind of orange plaid and need some seat covers, call
