I've done the same, although I now have the &quot;proper&quot; bus muffler.  I've
never noted any exhaust fumes at all, nor have I noted any change in
power.  The exhaust tip of the bus muffler is really teeny, so it would be
logical to have a bit more back pressure.  I always thought that this was
why the bus engine was rated slightly lower in HP than the bug engines.

The bug muffler also helps ground clearance behid the left rear wheel.  I
scrape a lot more with the bus exhaust.

  I suppose you could install 2 bus tailpipe
&gt; assemblies onto a bug muffler, but the best insurance against fumes is probably
&gt; to make sure that the rear hatch and engine hatch door seals are in good
&gt; condition, and the doors are closed when the bus is under way.  I've never
&gt; noticed fumes in the bus, except when I had problems with muffler to heat
&gt; exchanger air side leaks.  I think the back pressure difference between the two
&gt; setups is negligable, since the inner diameter of the peashooters is quite a bit
&gt; smaller than the ID of the single outlet tailpipe assembly.

&gt; &gt; I believe the beetle (2-tip) muffler is not recommended for the bus in that
&gt; &gt; the exhaust is directly behind the bus, creating a vortex of noxious fumes
&gt; &gt; that remains with the (back of the) bus whilst moving.  The bus tailpipe may
&gt; &gt; solve this by discharging the exhaust a little closer to the so-called
&gt; &gt; slipstream.  ....
