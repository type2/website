Subject: Re: Wiper arms, safaris, &amp; the AIRS site...

my $.02 would be to keep it public.   id help anyone
in need, especially if you have a bus.   it is after
all a listing of people willing to help, thats why my
name is on there.   if someone isn't lucky enough to
know about the type2 site yet, but somehow still gets
ahold of the list, so be it.  if they are a royal PIA,
then i wasted a little of my time.   on the other
hand, you could make someones whole trip, so to me it
would be worth it.   anyways if the individual turns
out to be a jerk, then my ability to help suddenly
becomes a lot less is all.   of course its only my
opinion so take it FWIW.   we all know me and my karma
philosophy so i tend to throw on the rose colored
glasses when i see someone in need, especially a bus
owner.

&gt; When the AIRS site first went up I expressed my
&gt; concern that it be
&gt; access limited. This is exactly why. So perhaps this
&gt; is a well meaning
&gt; guy who would be interested in helping others in
&gt; turn. But maybe not.
&gt; Neato doesnt publish the travel directory to non
&gt; members and I dont
&gt; think this should be either. Opinions?
