Subject: [T2] 73 Orange Bus made out of gold

Hi all, I was just perusing traderonline and ran across a fine example of a
Bus for a paultry $17000.

My question, is it possible that a Bus, even with low miles, excellent
everything, and at a place that is known for higher than high prices, is
worth even close to 17G?  Or is this place smoking the wacky stuff....again?

Mike
76 Bus (maybe I should think about selling....)
