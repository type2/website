Subject: Re: [T2] rebuild wont start! any ideas?

I had a similar problem when i rebuilt my 75 FI bus and went to start it. 
Took me the longest time to figure out the problem. This may sound stupid 
but the distributer shaft wasn't in the right position. It was 180 degrees 
off. Scince the timing mark on the fan lines up with TDC twice for every 
engine cycle It's easy, atleast for me, to set the distributer so it ends up 
firing on the exhaust stroke rather than the compression stroke. To fix, I 
just set the engine to TDC, pulled out the distributer and shaft and then 
turned the engine 360 degrees (back to TDC) and put everything back 
together. Don't know if this is the same thing you're experiencing but, 
thought i would share. Good luck!

&gt;
&gt;i've been getting great advice on the list as i've rebuilt my 4th van 
&gt;(along with many other things here and there through the years)... and now 
&gt;i have another question on my latest...
&gt;
&gt;did a full rebuild on Lucy, my latest 75 1.8 camper, and just finished 
&gt;getting everything together this morning... hooked everything up and turned 
&gt;it over and she caught for a fraction of a second and died... kept doing 
&gt;this, and on about the fourth time there was a puff of fuel-air and a 
&gt;little bit of flame out one of the intake hoses (the hoses that seal the 
&gt;connection between the intake air distributor and the intake headers - the 
&gt;two deals on either side that the injectors are attached to)... anyway, it 
&gt;only happened on the left side...
&gt;
&gt;so i have rebuilt heads from a shop here in seattle (northwest connecting 
&gt;rods)... i noticed that they pink their valve seats in, if that makes a 
&gt;difference here... the reason i mention valves is because as i've thought 
&gt;this problem through this evening on my way up to the san juans in Molly, 
&gt;my backup 76 celica that i bought for two hundred bucks when i tore the van 
&gt;engine apart and who has run perfectly fine for five months even though she 
&gt;backfires, diesels, and can't maintain an idle in the cold (you should see 
&gt;the nightmare that the last mechanic to work on her made of the carb 
&gt;linkages and lines - yet there's nothing quite like the 20R enging) - i've 
&gt;been thinking that the only reason you might get pressure back into the 
&gt;intake headers is if the intake valves are not sealing all the way when the 
&gt;piston is on the upswing, so i must be getting some blowby into the intake 
&gt;system... but i did set the valves, and i'm fairly certain i did it 
&gt;correctly (i say fairly only beca!
&gt;use i am always second guessing myself)...
&gt;
&gt;anyway, if anyone might have an idea of what might be wrong (incidentally, 
&gt;though i continued trying to start her she didn't flame out the headers 
&gt;again but she still pushes fuel air out cause there is a bit of moisture 
&gt;coming out those hoses) i'd love to hear some advice... a couple other 
&gt;things that might help the diagnosis: i put a clamp on the boot (that's 
&gt;probably a better word to use than hose) where it had pushed out before and 
&gt;that stopped it on that side, but only that side... i could conceivably 
&gt;clamp all 8 points on those boots (leading to both heads that is) but the 
&gt;more i think about it the more i'm worried about the fact that pressure is 
&gt;coming up from the heads... one thing to note on the side that it is 
&gt;pushing out the two tubes on the header are slightly cocked to the ports on 
&gt;the air ditributor so the boots aren't quite straight, thus might not make 
&gt;a terrific seal... also, with further attempts at starting she would start 
&gt;and run for a half second (but lon!
&gt;ger than at first) and then cough to a stop... usually it was when she 
&gt;coughed to a stop that i'd hear air being forced out of those boots... oh 
&gt;yeah and my timing might not be right on (4 atdc that is) as i didn't mark 
&gt;the distributor position adequately (though it's a rebuild with a new cam 
&gt;anyway) - but i did line it up with the post for plug 1 with the crank at 
&gt;timing... so i can't be far off
&gt;
&gt;so the plan now is to doube check the valves, see about sealing those 
&gt;boots, and cross my fingers unless someone has a better idea... and any 
&gt;help would be appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;worry for writing a book here but i have this tendency to write like a talk 
&gt;and my third grade teacher always did say i had a problem with talking too 
&gt;much :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;thanks!
