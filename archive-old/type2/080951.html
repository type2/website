Subject: Re: [T2] Head Temp Sensor

Sorry for the confusion. I have a 74 Carburated bus on which I am installing
a VDO head temp sensor, the kind where the sending ring replaces the
compression washer under the #3 spark plug. My question is: How have others
routed the sender wire away from the plug and through the tin to continue
it's way under the bus to the front?

Up through the tin into the engine bay? Down past the pushrod tubes and
trough the lower tin? Just looking for suggestions.

Thanks,
Dave

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm going to be installing a head temp sensor under the #3 spark plug
and
&gt; &gt; I'm wondering how others have handles routing the wire out from under
the
&gt; &gt; tin. Any suggestions?
&gt; &gt; BTW- 1974, 1.8 ltr.  Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt; Not sure I understand your question. Are you asking 'how to replace it?'.
If
&gt; yes, it is a major PITA. Don't you love how they hid it under the tin
above
&gt; the spark plug? The easiest way I have found is to get a 1/2&quot; drive 12mm 6
&gt; point DEEP socket. I pack all the wire up in the socket.
&gt;
&gt; You have a 74 with FI?  Is it an auto trans Calif version bus?
