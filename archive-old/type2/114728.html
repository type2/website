Subject: Anyone parting a '68-71 Westy?

I'm looking for the following parts in good to excellent condition:

Passenger side front vent wing window assembly - clear glass - w/ good 
rubber

Cabinet handles - grey - w/ and w/out pushbutton

Full set of OEM curtains - will buy individual curtains

Jalousie window knob - tan color - will buy pair of grey knobs if 
condition is excellent

Rubber moulding for perimeter of opening in ceiling into pop-top area

Full set of OEM (or VW of A) bumper guards - will buy individual guards 
or rubbers

Steering wheel

Wire rack (shelf) for inside of ice box

Door pull for front door - black plastic mounting tabs

Windshield - clear glass

Shock cord (elastic cord which holds the bottom of the curtains)

Rear shelf (over the Z-bed on '70-'71 models)

Cup hook (white colored hook next to closet door which the sliding door 
curtain attaches to when deployed)

Sliding door inner panel - wood

Rear door inner panel - wood

Right front kick panel (black panel in front of passenger's feet)

Right front curtain track (plastic channel over front passenger door 
opening - pop riveted to body)

Beige front seats (probably cheaper to buy new covers than to ship 
seats)

Right front door inner panel - beige

Rubber pads for air cleaner pedestal (air cleaner sits on these three 
rubber pads)

Back-up light boots (covers the wire connections on the back side of 
the lights)

Plastic plugs for rear of body (above the rear bumper brackets)

Similar to Beetle headlight bucket drains)

small socket, big socket, and hub cap remover)

Underseat rubber mats - black rubber mats just inside eack front door

Driver's side outside mirror



Yeah, I know that some of this stuff is available as repro stuff, but 
I'd rather have original.  If anyone has a lead on NOS stuff, I'm all 
ears.  ;-)

THANKS MUCH!
