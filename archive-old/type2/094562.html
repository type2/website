------=_NextPart_001_0010_01C24E83.AAC53B50

Good morning campers!

For those of you who are coming, or contemplating coming to &quot;Busses Nowhe=
re Near The Arch #18&quot; (BNNTA) in a couple of days, here's the latest upda=
te.  =20

As mentioned in an earlier post, the Rangers have happily agreed to open =
the gates to the &quot;group&quot; campground where the event is held so that those=
 who arrive early can settle into the campsites of their choice (Sites #1=
0 through #13 are reserved for the staff and event staging area).  If you=
 stay there Thursday night, you are responsible to pay the ranger when th=
ey come through occasionally for the normal one night campground fee.  On=
ce we arrive late Friday morning we'll set up and then everyone can regis=
ter throughout the day for the whole, long holiday weekend.  There is no =
pre-registration necessary, just register with our staff upon your arriva=
l.  Remember that only VW's (of any type, year and model) will be allowed=
 to stay in the event's &quot;group campground&quot;.  If for any reason you find t=
hat you &quot;have to&quot; arrive in anything other than a VW, you will be allowed=
 to drop off your camping supplies inside the campground, and then requir=
ed to move your non-VW vehicle to a boat ramp parking lot (the closest on=
e) about a 1/4 mile from our event for the weekend.  This is, after all, =
a VW camping event, and everyone enjoys the fact that at &quot;this&quot; event, al=
l that you're going to see around you when you crawl out of your van each=
 morning are lots and lots of VW's for three or four days!  No Chevy's, F=
ords, Toyotas, motor homes, etc!  =20

Yes, dogs are allowed in the Group campground, but the usual common-sense=
 rules apply (leashed, pick up after the dog, avoid your dog fighting wit=
h other dogs, etc.).  The group campground features nice Corps of Enginee=
r built bathrooms with hot/cold showers, paved roads and pads, a children=
's playground, the 22 mile long Mark Twain Lake, the nearby &quot;main&quot; campgr=
ound which has a sandy swimming beach, a nearby boat ramp for your water =
toys, a nearby marina (boat rentals, fishing supplies), and the town of M=
onroe City about 13 miles away with general shopping and conveniences. =20

We're delighted to report that the latest weather forecast says it will b=
e an excellent weekend for camping!  High's during the day are forecast t=
o be in the mid 80's!!!  You better remember to bring a sweatshirt or lig=
ht jacket for the evenings around the campfire, it might actually get kin=
da cool at night!

Saturday's Bus caravan will stop just outside of historic Hannibal, MO at=
 the historic Mark Twain Cave where we have three private cave tours book=
ed in the totally primitive and undeveloped Cameron Cave complex.  The gu=
ided tours will be by lantern light and last about an hour!

Well that's enough for now.  We're looking forward to seeing many of you =
again in a couple of days, and it's not too late to scramble and join us =
for the Type 2 festivities!  See the web site at  www.BNNTA_dot_com  for basi=
c info and a Mapquest link for directions.  It's only Wednesday and our f=
irst busses are about to arrive!  =20

Please drive sensibly and safely, and enjoy the ride!
