Subject: Long Slow Driving Trip over:(
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hey volks,
just wanted to let everyone know that we are back from
our vacation in Lizzy.   She performed great taking 4
adults plus tons of camping gear over about 3500 miles
covering 7 states and Canada.   Was a great trip,
camped in rest areas on the trip out and back, and
camped at the grassroots music festival for 4 days in
her as well.    met a couple listees at grassroots and
saw a bunch of busses.   i took pix of all the buses
who camped on site so i will be making a trip page on
my website with those included in the next week or so.
  also have some good pix of the border guys (Canada)
and the drug dog going through the bus..._dot_can't be too
careful of those darn hippies:)   all in all a great
vacation and NO PROBLEMS with the bus at all.   man
that was nice.   well im back to the grind.   ill post
a little AIRS help story and the link to the trip page
later.   have a great week.
