Still Friday out here on the West Coast....  

I must second that emotion and send my fondest &quot;get well&quot; wishes out to my
main man Phil and his new liver.  I listen to the Dead as much (or more)
now as I did when we first randomly crossed paths over 10 years ago, and
the thunder that Phil could make with his bass is a major part of that --
his sounds continue to move me.  Phil didn't just pluck bass lines; he
dropped bombs.  (I speak in the past tense because I always think of him in
the context of the Dead, not in current incarnations.)  Although the sound
of Phil in my bus is nothing compared to what it was like in the &quot;Phil
Zone&quot; at a show (Deadhead listees will know what I mean), there is nothing
quite like driving the bus and turning heads with Lesh carpet bombs
exploding (and rattling cabinets) from within. Long Live Lesh!  Get well
soon, Phil.
