&gt;thing is: can i interchange diferent types of gears to get

&gt;1600'cc gearbox. And with those little tires i'll have hell
&gt;of a torque now, but probaly a lack of high cruisespeeds.
&gt;In which relation/size should i change my gears to get a
&gt;cruise speed of round' 120km/h (top) but still have torque
&gt;enough remaining to climb hills in 3 gear without losing
&gt;too much rpm's/speed. Does anybody have an idea ?

You should be able to swap in the 32/7 (4.57) ring and pinion (vs. the 38/7
(5.43) you probably have now) to get the cruising speed you want.
