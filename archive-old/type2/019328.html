Morris,
What was wrong with your original vac advance distributor?  The vacuum
advance is a much better distributor because it combines the advance at
low rpms *and* at higher rpms.  Plus, you don't have the lack of power
coming right off of idle.  If you are using your VW for casual everyday
driving, I'd go with the vac distributor.  If you need help rebuilding
your vacuum one, let me know and I'll forward over an article I'm
working on.

later,
Mike

&gt; I have a 70 bus 1600sp .Also installed a 009 dist. Man at the shop
&gt; said to statically time it at 71/2 to 10 deg. BTDC. I did and it runs great.
&gt; Total advance is 28. Would like to know if this timing is correct. The
&gt; old vac. adv. dist. set at 0 deg. Am very happy with this setting if it is
&gt; right. This is my first vw am new to this.
