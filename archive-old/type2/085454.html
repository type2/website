Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

Dave Wolfanger sends:

&gt; A diesel engine works by compressing kerosene ( or fuel oil ) until it
&gt; explodes. Starting fluid is too volatile all by itself, and will destroy a
&gt; diesel immediately. A more correct starting fluid for a diesel engine would be
&gt; WD-40 !

No, a diesel works by compressing air until it's hot enough to ignite light
oil, then injecting some. There is no fuel in the cylinder on the
compression stroke.

You can use starting fluid on a diesel, but you must have a starting fluid
injection kit on the engine. Just squirting it into the air intake from a
can, like you do on a gas engine, will blow the engine up.
