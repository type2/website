Subject: R: [T2] bus, not an ice-box!


&gt;Make sure that all of the cooling tin is on the engine, make sure that the 
&gt;engine to body seal is there and in good shape, and make sure the heater 
&gt;boxes are in good shape.
&gt;There is a catalog on a British website (Bugbits?) that has all the 
&gt;diagrams of the parts. Also the Busboys website has good diagrams.

Thanks, I'll check all that.

&gt;I used to live in Napoli when I was in the Navy. I LOVE your country! 
&gt;Wonderful, nice people. Best 3 years of my single life!
&gt;Got an e-mail from my doctor friend near Naples (Casal di Prinicipe) this 
&gt;morning.

Really? I am originally from Napoli myself!!! Were you on the Saratoga?
We've been wandering if there was actually someone on that ship!!! Best
sight on Xmas in the bay... ;-)

&gt;If you have more questions let me know. I am busy this morning and lack 
&gt;alot of extra time. I can send you copies of the diagrams you need though 
&gt;via e-mail.

Oh yeah! I could use some info on the heating system of my bus, but I have
no hurry (only work on it on weekends) so really don't rush just to help me.
Also, my mailbox at andy_at_simonetwork_dot_net can handle unlimited mail size.

&gt;You have a Beetle powered bus? (1600cc?).
It's a 1600cc, yes. And beside the heating it does an outstanding job!


Thanks again, and be welcome back here!

Andy
