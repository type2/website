Ok... I'm pissed.  I just added oil to my 79 Loaf about a month ago.  I hardly
ever drive it because I attend college that won't allow a freshman to have a
car on campus.  I'm back home for spring break and I just started the bus up
and heard this terrible knocking noise! Now, I know there's oil in there, cuz
ain't no oil leak gonna do that! What's the deal??
