Subject: body/paint work Price

--When I shopped for quotes, they ran from 700.00 to 5000.00 and up.

Exterior paint only, no prep, no bodywork included.

That ranged from the assembly line place that didn't have time to talk to me about the bus to the high end insurance work/custom shop that didn't want me to actually commit them to something like that.

Also received, &quot;we don't work on volkswagens&quot;.

Later,

Billy

&gt;I was wondering what other people have paid for body and paint work?
