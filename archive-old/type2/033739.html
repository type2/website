&gt; I have seen this phenomenon on a VW and on a Toyota.
&gt; Can anybody explain why this happens.

&gt; &gt; - If I pull the wire from cyl. 2, it actually speeds up if I allow
&gt; &gt; sparks to fly through the air (&gt;1.5 cm!), but if I put it back the
&gt; &gt; wire it goes back to the old RPM. Which is the same as when I do
&gt; not
&gt; &gt; allow the sparks to fly, by the way.

The voltage (and therefore the power) delivered by the spark depends
upon the gap across which the spark jumps.  Normally, this gap is the
one on the end of the spark plug.  When you create a larger gap, you
force the system to provide a higher voltage, therefore the spark
energy becomes greater, therefore your mixture ignites better.

At least that's the theory.  Seems to work, and more modern cars run
higher voltages and larger gaps for this reason.
