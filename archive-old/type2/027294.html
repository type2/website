I drove to L.A today to pickup a mexican longblock with a friend for his 
bus. We got it from BFY obsolete parts in Orange. We walk in and see a 
mexican longblock on an engine stand. I ask the guy if they have one in the 
box. He says no thats the only one they have. I ask them about the Warranty, 
He says there is none offered by VW of Mexico. I look it over and it looks 
just like my Mexican longblock when I got it. (thanks oldvolks home). We pay 
for it and then the guy tell us that it comes with the engine stand and the 
clutch that are on it. I get really suspicious and ask the guy if he is 
kidding. He says no. We take the engine out to my bus and load it in the 
back when I notice the two factory instaled spark plugs are missing. I go 
back in the story and the guy gives me a set of plugs. I am completly thrown 
off by this situation. I have never been treated that nicely by a retailier 
in the VW indusrty except by Ron. In a daze we drive away. We get home after 
battleing L.A traffic. I look it over one more time and finaly notice the 
the factory yellow paint on the threads is broken. I also notice that there 
is red gasket sealer at the base on the pistion. At this point I realize 
that the heads have been taken off after it left the factory. BFY will not 
be open tommrow. I have to wait till monday to call them and try to find out 
the real story behind the engine. I am really sad because I am trying to 
help this kid get his bus back on the road. He saved a long time to be able 
to buy this long block. Now we are stuck with an engine with an uncertian 
past. I think I am going to call them back and just ask for an exchange for 
a motor in a box. I have a feeling they are going to try to mess with me and 
say I took off the heads. What I want from the list is any advice you guys 
and girls might have on the situation.
