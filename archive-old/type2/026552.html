&gt;The engine--she no wana start. I historically get the timing 180 out of 
&gt;wack on the 914 engines I've built (probably from reading Wilson's 
&gt;directions), so I got the pulley at TDC, pulled the dist. out and turned 
&gt;the engine around 180 degrees, re-installed dist. and it still wouldn't 
&gt;start but I got slight backfire thru the carb.

Pull off the #1 / #2 valve cover.  Rotate your engine to where you believe
#1 TDC should be.  Have a friend rotate the motor back and forth about 20
degrees + and - from TDC (about 11:00 - 1:00) while you watch the valves for
#1.  If neither valves move at all, that's #1 TDC.  If one of the valves is
moving, rotate the engine 360 degrees and check it there.

If you've not completely sure if #1 is at the top of its stroke, pull the #1
spark plug and insert a pencil or screwdriver through the hole to fell the
top of the cylinder.

Hope this helps.
