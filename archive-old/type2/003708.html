Matt:

Just to make sure; the engine in your '79 and the engine from the '80
are basically the same engine.  There's a few fairly minor changes
that need to be made to the '80 case (others have detailed these
changes) so everything fits OK in your '79 engine bay, but it's not
that big of deal.  If I had a &quot;known good&quot; '80 engine I wouldn't
hesitate to put it in a '79 bus.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I wrote the original question.
&gt; Answer is yes, I have all the tin, mounts etc.
&gt; Basically, the 79's crankshaft snapped (have a
&gt; feeling the case is toast but havent checked yet),
&gt; and I was going to install the 80 (friend gave it to me) if
&gt; it was easy enough.
&gt;
&gt; If you guys are saying it's a pain in the ass,
&gt; mabye im suddenly in the market for a running or rebuildable
&gt; 78-79 engine.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But he has 79 tin, shroud and alternator mount doesn't he?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The tin is different, the shroud is different, the way the
alternator
&gt; &gt;&gt;connects is different, the oil breather is different, way more of
a pain
&gt; &gt;&gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt;the ass then it would be worth.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I have a air cooled 73, and a 81, I have both engines in the
garage (the
&gt; &gt;&gt;73
&gt; &gt;&gt;motor is from a 77) and I will tell you it is significantly
different but
&gt; &gt;&gt;similar.  I am sure it could be done, but I would take an easier
route.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Very minor case differences that shouldn't matter and the  79
&gt; &gt;(071)heads are the same which is the big difference.  Swap out the
&gt; &gt;heater boxes, tin, shroud,  alt mount, and which ever way you are
&gt; &gt;going with the dip stick.  Drill out the 79 engine mounts to 12mm
and
&gt; &gt;it should fit just fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I just went the other direction.  Put a 78 case into a 83 Vanagon.
&gt; &gt;Only difference is the engine carrier inserts in the case need to
be
&gt; &gt;enlarged to 12 mm and I needed to drill a hole for the dip stick.
No
&gt; &gt;sweat!  I'm going to build a spare long block this way also so I
can
&gt; &gt;use it on my 77 also (with vanagon heater boxes)
