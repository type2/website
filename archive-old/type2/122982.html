Subject: hesitation/bucking update

ok, i have replaced the points &amp; condenser.  i drove the truck around for
about 20 minutes &amp; it started hesitating/bucking again.  then i unhooked the
wire for the tach from the coil, as it may be grounding out somewhere. still
happening.

also, it is now stalling out whenever i bring it to a stop.

i am now suspecting my ignition switch on the steering column, which
coincidentally is an aftermarket switch.  any thoughts on that?  (where is a
good place to go get another aftermarket switch &amp; any suggestions on
model/brand?)

again, i do not suspect a fuel problem b/c the tank has been treated. also
the fuel filter looks very clean.

remember, this only happens once the bus has been driven about 20 minutes or
so.

also, i considered just trying to put a new harness in the truck. anyone got
the contact info for &quot;Wiring Works&quot;?

thanks for the responses so far &amp; keep 'em coming. i was hoping to make a
campout next weekend in Columbia, SC. but if i need to stay home thats ok -
i just don't wanna miss EveryBus!
