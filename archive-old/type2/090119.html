Subject: Re: [T2] fan removal?

&gt; so i am trying to remove the fan from the gen..
&gt; anyone have a trick for this?

If you loosen the fan nut while the gen pulley is still on and the shroud
is still sitting on the engine you can get a lot more leverage and stop
the gen spinning with the big screwdriver on the pulley trick.
