----- Original Message -----
What do you do when they're too close for comfort, especially at
speed?

----- Fantasy -----
I'd like to have some really, really, REALLY  loud airhorns pointed
behind my bus

----- Answer -----
I gradually slow down as much as it takes to get them to pass me.  I
don't want them lurking back there, loosing their patients, and
getting upset.   In my younger and dumber daze I'd down shift and let
out the clutch, thereby slowing the car down rapidly with no warning
of break lights.  I don't do that anymore, and don't suggest you do it
either.
