&gt; I run two of these Conti Contact 185R14-Reinforced on my bus. The tire shop

  I have 4 Michelin 205/70-14 MXT truck tires rated 99S  or almost 2,000
per tire and I have a full road hazard warranty on em, in fact just picked
up a nail somewhere and they took the tire off, repaired it from the
inside, new valve stem, rebalanced it, and put it back on the van.  cost
