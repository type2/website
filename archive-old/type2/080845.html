Ok, so the connections on the starter were pretty rusted up and while at
EB, the bus would not start because of this.  Jason Laster took a look
for me and after a few scraps with a wire brush, the baby turned over
:-)  Well, I put the bus on the ramps and proceded to give the stubs on
the starter a nice good cleaning.  Well, now that I cleaned all the
points, it wont turn over.  Not even a click.  Now, I am not sure if it
matters what wires get put on first or last as far as the group going on
the celenoid stud, but I don't think I put them back on in the same
order.  Would this matter?  Also, the large cable going from the starter
to the celenoid is pretty green.  I detached it from the celenoid and
cleaned that stub and the connector on it and put it back on.  Also,
there is a black piece of plastic that covers the forward portion of the
celenoid, in which the stubs come out of it.  I did break  a small piece
of it off  (About 1 inch).  Not sure if this matters but wanted to
include everything.  Thanks
