Subject: Re: VW Trends Follies

I own R&amp;T issues from 1959 through about 1985 or so.  R&amp;T lost most all 
it's personality when John and Ilene Bond sold it. There are still a 
couple good columnists (ie: Peter Egan) but for all intents and purposes 
it's just another Motor Trend these days. No personality.

For you young folks, there are a couple of old R&amp;T articles on 
&lt;http://wetwesties1.tripod_dot_com&gt; that will show you how it used to be. 
Just plain superb writing.

&lt;&lt; I wonder if the same could be true of the mainstream car mags like 
Cart and Driver and Road &amp; Track. Those aren't very interesting anymore 
either.
