Subject: Re: Brake light battle continues

Have you ever seen the old style bus taillight housing that had two bulbs in 
it? I was flipping through my Haynes manual and noticed that one of the 
pictures had on in it. I think the Haynes manual is British thefore my powers 
of deductive reasoning told me this must be something European.
