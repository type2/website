Subject: Buses Of The Corn 2007 trip report

Hi Volks,

Elvis has left the building. 57 buses have come and gone and BOTC2007  
is now completed. We had 134 people attend and everything went very  
smoothly; the weather was magnificent and many people commented that  
the corn was the best they had ever tasted.

Many thanks to all those who attended; particularly those who drove  
long distances in their buses for the first time. Also a big thanks  
to my Family who help tremendously to make the event a success .  
Jamie Rivers took up my quest to run a 50/50 draw in support of the  
type2 list so that our event was able to send $100 to support type2_dot_com.

I posted my pics on Facebook; you don't need an account to see them  
if you use this link:

I will post more links to pics on the website as they come in. Now if  
you'll excuse me, I have to go unpack the bus.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
