I reply:
Soon after I got my bus I had to replace the battery.  After this it started running rougher and rougher until it was backfiring so much I could not drive it.  I checked what I could (not much), took it to two different shops and finally the local shyster VW dealer, who diagnosed it in about 10 minutes.  The gaskets on the outboard ends of the manifolds were rotted and there was a big intake air leak as a result. I think I probably knocked the manifolds, and 20-year old gaskets, when I was installing the new battery.  So I spent hundreds of dollars and about 6 weeks diagnosing and repairing something I could have found with a can of WD-40 and fixed in about 30 minutes.

But I love my bus.

Good luck,
