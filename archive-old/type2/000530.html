Hi Steve,

[...]I read your type2_at_type2_dot_com post (in response to Todd's original post).
Based on your comments about sway bars, would I be better off not having a
rear sway bar if I were to drive my 71' Westy through Mexico and Central
America due to the poor road conditions down there?  I would like to at
least upgrade my front sway bar (for better handling).  Would that pose any
problems on rough roads?

Thanks.
