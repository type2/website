Subject: question about pipe

Hi all,

     I was looking at a another westy today &amp; found something odd.
Underneith between the frame rails was some kind of protective plate.
Coming out the side of the van in front of the drivers side rear wheel was
what looked like a exhaust pipe.  I can not see anything because of this
plate.  Any ideas?  I probably will not buy the bus as it needs a transaxle.
Thanks.
