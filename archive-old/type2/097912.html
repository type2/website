&gt;The catalogs have new mirrors if you want to go that route.

The vast majority of mirrors come from south of the border and some vendors are quite honest and will say they can't guarantee that you'll get matching mirrors: some have a black bead around the edge and some white.  I've seen these on other busses and they look cheap.

For a little bit more you can get a German mirror.  Someone once told me that Hagus was the OEM for the mirror back in the day but I'm not 100% sure.
