Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Without Heater Boxes?/Conversions

I have one of those bombs, I believe a BN4, in the back.  My Corvair
conversion did not have the heater boxes hooked up.  The gas heater by
itself was not too effective in the rear and ridiculously dangerous.  It is
a factory original setup, though!  As if it wasn't enough of a risk of CO
poisoning - and I have had a problem with that even though the heater was
rebuilt by a specialty place - the specially made metal duct runs out of the
heater and then directly along the left side of the gas tank, with a duct
joint that barely fits together right beside the tank.  It is amazing to me
that they could ever get away with this setup.  I did not recognize how bad
it was until the other day when I was swapping the engine to a VW and had
the bulkhead out.  I am never using the heater again.. I recommend layered
clothing and a small electric heater for the windshield plus good wipers and
washer fluid.  Also, I would not have a converted-engine bus again.  The
ease of working on the VW is amazing and just about anything else you could
put in there is going to be a tighter fit and heavier.  I am no purist but
the Corvair with all its power, torque, and quietness was great for
performance but yet it completely changed the character of the bus.  Glen
