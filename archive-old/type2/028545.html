I paid $500 for my 74 last July. I have about another $400 into it since
then - mostly stuff like tires, battery, brake lines. I do all of my own
work which keeps costs down there. The body is all original and it is
currently on the second engine (231,000 total miles). I am planning on
replacing the engine again in the near future, as well as undertaking a
restoration. This vehicle is my daily driver, however. I have put over
10,000 miles on it so far. Should you care to see the Bus, it's on my
website at http://www.robwitham_dot_com/bus.html

Peace,

74 Bus

what is the average $$ people spend on their beloved vw vehicles?

i was lucky enough to not have to pay for the purchase of my bus, but i
have certainly paid since the day i brought it home.
