Subject: Re: [T2] 68 Baywindow Wheel Locked Up

Not the stuff I used!  Been tested at 100 degree plus in full sun all day 
at the Eureka springs show....i147 degree pavement too!

Plastic looking on one side and tar/rocky looking on the other side.
I think Chris Mills and I used the same stuff.  Dirt cheap and when you 
tap on the outside panels, it sounds like a mercedes instead of a 
vw&lt;grin&gt;.

Labeled &quot;sca&quot; or something like that.._dot_comes in a big roll..if you buy 
some, then ask me how I put mine on.

I *did* buy it at the local roofing supply  place.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Careful with the roofing supplies, tho'...I seem to recall a rather amoral
&gt; dealer on the net selling cheap sound-proofing that was actually roofing
&gt; underlayment (or such) that it was meant to soften with heat...but tend-
&gt; ed to melt into an oozing mess at the bottom of your doors when parked 
&gt; in the sun... ?-(
