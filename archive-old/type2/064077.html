Subject: Towing with a 71?

Hello all.. I am in the process of restoring a 71 camper..  Really bad 
shape, welder coming tommorrow to cut and replace the panels...  I have 
the engine out and it is waiting for me to show it the way..

What I was wondering was how good can the aircooled beast be at towing a 
boat... like 1,000lbs on a trailer?  Should I increase the displacement, 
or will 1600cc do fine?

Any Hints?

Kris B.
