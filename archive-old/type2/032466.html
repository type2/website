I am usually very reluctant to join in on these &quot;debates&quot;, but I will share 1 experience.  I order a lot of stuff from bus depot, recently I ordered kick &amp; door panels for the '66.  It took about 3 weeks for delivery (custom order, so longer time) I paid about $130 for the order.  If I had ordered from a certain large Colorado Company's catalog I would have paid about $170. I I'm no tight wad but $40 to me is &quot;righteous bucks dude&quot;, to quote Spiccoli.  I'm not knocking that other company, they have good products and they DO ship very fast.  So my advice is: If your made out of money and like things now, order from the larger guy.  Or if you have to watch how you spend your bread and still want quality, Bus depot is a good option, you may just need to be patient. My bus is 35 years old, if it has to wait another few days for a part it needs in order to save me some dough, I think she'll understand.  Maybe the question you should ask is &quot;Why did you order from Bus Depot in the!
  f!

irst place??&quot;  I'll bet it was the price!
