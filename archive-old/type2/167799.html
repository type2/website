Subject: Re: [T2] Welding Equipment

	A non-certified non-welder can pass along reliable info from 
experienced informants.  That is all I claim to do re welding. 
Sorry, youse experts  -  us amateurs are just as important, in our 
way.

	When I see John A. asking about TIG welders but then explaining

&gt;  This is for me a hobby machine, and purely a splurge, so I can weld 
&gt;up a bit of aluminum gas/fluid tight myself at home.  It has me 
&gt;wondering about all the combo machines available on ebay that stick, 
&gt;TIG, and plasma cut,

	I point to my archived  note on Lumiweld, the Florida 
invention a quarter-century ago which allows a cheap LPG-air torch 
(which you probably already have) to join aluminum with no special 
gas, just brazing out in the open air to join aluminum, and I've 
found it works pretty well on aluminium too  :-)
	A Kiwi firm sells ali boats in the 'zodiac' form but nothing 
pneumatic  -  aluminium 'pontoons' c. 18' fat, in the 'capital U' 
formation, welded from aluminium flat sheet to make 8  -  or is it 16 
-  'sides' to the 'tube'.  I talkied with the boss and a couple key 
workers at a trade show.  They join Al

1.  in small prototypes  -  by Lumiweld which is strong but slow.
2.  in production fast ali welding, TIG or MIG can both do it and so 
much argument can be brought to bear that you start to suspect it's 
not a huge difference.  The various metal feedwires usu needed for 
MIG welding are an asset or an annoyance, depending what versatility 
you want.

So, welder John, please bone up on Lumiweld before you buy any new gear!
