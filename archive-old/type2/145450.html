Subject: Re: [T2] Photos of my tach install

I got it from Walmart, it is an Equus brand, I believe 3-1/4&quot; in diameter. It was around 30 bucks I think, and has the option of being for 4-6-8 cylinder. Very easy to install, I just cut the correct circle out of the blank face plate in the dash, and slid it down into that. It was then siliconed on the back to keep it in place, but easily removable if need be. 
  Hope that helps

  Which tach is that ? Where did you get it from?

I am thinking of installing a tach when I install my boston bob engine.

Thanks !
Steve
