Hi Bob,

     &quot;This is not a long term repair&quot;! Once while on a 1000 mile trip, I
spit a plug on a 1600. Being stuck, limited tools, no place to work, I =
replaced
the plug with a industrial engine (coldest heat range I could find at =
the
Flaps) Ford 18mm plug! I have a plug &quot;Tap&quot; that is 14mm on one end and
18mm on the other. Since the hole was striped and the tap is tapered, it =
started
very easy.
     In your case, where the head is most likely a goner anyway, this =
may be
something to get you up and going &quot;short term&quot;. I don't know what would
happen over a long period of stop and go driving, as the heat range had =
to
be way off. When I finished my trip and tore down the engine, I didn't =
find
any damage what so ever, but again I would keep it short term.
    Good luck!
