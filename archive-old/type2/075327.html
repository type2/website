Subject: Re: [T2] telling if cam bearing is bad

I'd say that at 231K you're looking at a normal wear situation.
A few flakes in your strainer when you change/clean it at 6/10K miles
intervals isn't anything to get frightened about.
If you've got low compression from 231K of wear the bearings will
probably last a pretty good while longer.
I'd be running 20/50 wt oil in that engine and easing off on hill climbs
and fighting headwinds.
Most likley you're going to need a rebuild within about ten to twenty
thousand miles and you can address the cam bearings just like all of your
other bearings at that time by replacing them.
There are no ports or other methods of inspection for the drive end or
any other cam bearing excepting that you can look at your rod bearings
with a cylinder/piston removed from the engine.
They all wear together....... strange thing, the main bearings seem to be
exterrmly durable and show very little wear in comparison to the other
bearings. Why is that?

Actually 231,700 mi now....so what is the symptom of a bad cam 
&gt; bearing, &gt; since many rebuild just the top end and rods??
