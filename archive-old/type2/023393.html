   If you need one or even think you do BUY IT NOW. The 2 importers I know
that still even have any have increased the price by 40 per-cent. I bought
the last of them my normal supplier had and got shorted 2 and they are OUT
and don't see any coming in in the near future.  Shop the internet if you
need or call any shop you deal with and try to get one. I used to sell them
at $149.95, the last few I had went out at 169.95 and if I can get anymore
they will be around $200.00 or more.  


ronnie   old volks of az      just trying to keep you informed
