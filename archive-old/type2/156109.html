&gt; 
&gt;    Some years ago I gave a friend a ride over to a Stereo Boutique
to pick up his car and its new stereo. The installer looked at my
car and said he had just the stereo for it and it was on sale in-
cluding installation and a pair of gee-whizz speakers. I said OK
and he brought it out...Luckily I stopped him before he took it
out of the box. I asked him if it'd play with positive ground and
he said there's no such thing...
So I lifted the nose on my Bugeye and said, &quot;Then you explain
why the positive terminal on the battery is bolted to the fire-
wall... ?-)
