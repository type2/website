Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust noise- from where in head?

&gt;Driving with my daughter at the wheel, the 75 she had recently rebuilt
&gt;developed a loud &quot;banging&quot; that got louder on accelletation or hill
&gt;climbing- did not get worse, power did not seem to change, so we drove
&gt;it home, 5 mi.
&gt;The banging came from the right head, and the builder (1.5 hr drive) on
&gt;the phone figured exhaust problem or broken rocker stud.  Pulled the
&gt;valve cover and checked out the rockers/valves and they seemed normal.
&gt;Ran the engine with each right plug pulled, and the noise goes away with
&gt;# 2 pulled.  Hmm, sounds like pulled manifold stud/bad gasket position,
&gt;so I checked the torque, and one was a little low but cam up to spec (18
&gt;ft lbs) without appearing to pull- noise is still there.  Revving the
&gt;engine lets one hear a bit of noise. With a flashlight I thought I saw
&gt;some black around the gasket.  Now this is a very lound noise, like
&gt;there has to be a good size gap to account for...any ideas what this is
&gt;before I yank all that heater box stuff to bring down the manifold?
&gt;This is the onepiece manifold/heaterbox.

I had on 1 old engine a rod bearing that made a bunch of noise like that 
and I drove it for another 9 or 10 months. Toasted the rod and crank but I 
didn't care (mail order JC Whipme engine that came with the car). Ran hot 
from day 1.

On another engine I had a hammering noise that turned out to be a worn 
wrist pin bushing (rod to piston pin).

Is this sound a fast sound (crank speed) or 1/2 rpm (cam and valve train) 
sound?
