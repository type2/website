Hello all,  I just bought my first bus last week (my first aircooled vw for 
that matter) a 1979 transporter with rotted out heaterboxes, exhaust, and 
battery tray.  I bought the GT muffler system from RMMW and heater boxed 
from a junkyard in AZ. I got everything but the heaterboxes and Im kind of 
scared at what those are gonna look like.  Anyway I assume the gt muffler 
systems replaces everything behind the heater boxes, thats what it looked 
like when I looked at it.  any tips anyone can give me about this setup 
would be appriciated

Paul
79 transporter
