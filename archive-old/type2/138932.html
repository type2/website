&gt; There used to be a kit available to make one from your stock sump plate. It
&gt; had a drilling pattern, sender and the right kind of nut to back up the
&gt; sender.

The instructions for modifying your here:

I don't think the angle of the bus dipstick will hit the sender location
shown in these instructions but I haven't proved that. This is where the
dipstick comes out:

The &quot;taco plate&quot; is VDO 240 827. I do not know if it comes with the cover.
The purpose of the cover is too keep the oil temp sender from being cooled
by the passing air and throwing off the reading. If you think you're reading
is too high you've got other problems.

You best source of finding these items used is a 914 in the junkyard. Not
all of them had them so that makes it a rare item espeically given the
rarity of finding a 914 in a VW junkyard. Porsche junkyards know the value
of this item.
