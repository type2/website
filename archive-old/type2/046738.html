Landon,

Turn your motor until the rotor is pointing in the general direction of the
terminal that has the wire that goes to the #1 plug.  Find the notch in the
pulley and line it up with the '0' deg. mark on the scale.  Ignore the scribe
mark on the distributor right now... Check (your numbers) valves 1 &amp; 2. 
rotate the engine counterclockwise 180 deg.  check 3 &amp; 4.  Rotate another 180
degrees (back to the timing notch again) and check 5 &amp; 6, turn another 180 and
check 7 &amp; 8.  You will have turned your engine two revolutions when you're
done.  That's how it's done.  

Who knows how the dist drive was installed.  Who knows how the dist. was
installed.  If the rotor is pointing toward the wire going to number 1, then
that's TDC #1.  Rotate the engine 360 deg and it'll still have the notch lined
up, but will be at TDC #3.

Why does this work?  Because the firing order is 1,4,3,2.  Turn it backwards
and it's 1,2,3,4.  Piece of cake!

Hope that this helps.

&gt; I'm still having a hard time adjusting my valves.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  Is it possible for a dizzy to be put in incorrectly? As in the
&gt; mark that should point to cylnder 1 being TDC is actually pointing to
&gt; cylnder 3 being TDC?
