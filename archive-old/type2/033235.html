 I just installed one for a friend.  Looks like they did a decent job
 building it, though we had to ship one head bck to have it welded where it
 was cracked around one of the exhaust stud bosses.  We recieved it back,
 and another was cracked... they had no problem accepting the head back for
 repair, and paid for shipping.  they also included all the new gaskets
 needed (i DID remind them to, of course...;)
 
 You will need to set your endplay, ours (w/o adjustment) was so tight the
 engine was seized up.
 
 The engine includes all needed gaskets, but you might wasnt to have a few
 extra valve cover seals handy anyway.  Also, our valvecovers were AWFUL.
 they both refused to seat correctly.  Their outer lips were bent inward.
 I got one to work, the other was so bad tha ti put a different cover on.
 
 Also, some of the sheet metal screw holes were drilled and tapped for
 larger (and not on hand) bolts, so watch out for that.
 
 the engine we ordered came with a nice german electric fuel pump, no wires
 though. a FI case, apparently, since the fump area was all blocked off.

I am no expert on engines, although to me, what David has reported on the 
1800 rebuild by AVP sounds ridiculous!

2 heads needed to be sent back?!?!?!  Talk about lack of paying close 
attention on AVP's part.  

Plus the endplay had to be reset?!?!  Again, I would certainly expect a 
rebuilder to check this vital info out before sending it out as &quot;finished&quot;

I am the world's biggest fan of paying close attention to everything I do-in 
my book these mistakes that AVP has made are not little...

I do realize that they have to deal with heads from almost 30 years ago, so 
they are working with the best they can, but still if the customer can see 
the head is cracked why can't AVP?!?!
