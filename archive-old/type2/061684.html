Subject: RE: Subaru Engine Conversion

	I haven't done one but I have done a V8 engine conversion and do
have a web site with some details on this plus a few other conversions for
VW's including a Subaru conversion.  Checkout my site at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Garage/1811 for details and pics and
stuff.

	Cheers

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone done a Subaru engine conversion or own a type 2 kombi with a
&gt; Subaru engine installed
