&gt;&gt; Cost is determined by the quality of work and the parts and supplies  needed.
&gt;&gt; as said you could spend as much as 3 times more.

&gt; ...so if we completely covered a bus in 1/2&quot; of bondo to cover rust

People,

This person is already getting roasted badly on thesamba, wouldn't it be
better if we leave that nonsense off this list?

Those who understand what I am talking about will understand, those who
don't, can do their homework and find out more, or ignore the whole thing. I
am not defending anyone, nor am I trying to stifle free speech, but this
list is pretty good natured and I personally like it that way.
