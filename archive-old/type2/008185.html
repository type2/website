Hi Listees

Mmmmm, a lot of posts on what NOT to do with your water tank!!!

Maybe those doing a little DIY will take heed of this, and remember that
when you install a water tank, you have to
make provision for draining the system completely. I have a 25 litre
inboard tank with a Whale supersub, it can be
removed completely. My next system (an underfloor tank just behind the fuel
tank, sink, shower room, vanity unit
and water heater) will have the necessary drain taps (they tend to come
with them these days), though I'll have to
cut holes in the floor for access! (Xmas present was a jigsaw).
