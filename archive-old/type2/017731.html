Brian:
I've been meaning to post this for a couple weeks and your message
finally bumped me to do so:
I joined the list too late to get any real-time Bob Hoover, but recently
picked up a &quot;Sermons&quot; CD from the Bus Depot and I have to say &quot;God, I
miss hearing from Hoover&quot; . I'm really impressed at the depth of his
knowledge and his scientific method. He's a pretty good story teller,
too. It's also comforting to know that he's lurking just below the
surface of this list.
