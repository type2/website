Subject: Rusty exhaust tube

I spent a long time cleaning 24 years of gunk off the bottom of the case to
expose the fins to the air and help the engine cool better.  Oil and mud had
conspired over the years and it was really caked on.

It was a lot of working using brushed and solutions to remove the grime.  In
the end I end I used an old scaling instrument that I asked my dentist to
give me during my last visit.  Really handy for a lot of cleaning and
scraping tasks in tight places.

While under there I noticed that my heater boxes seem sturdy but one of the
exhaust pipes that attaches to the the head rattles because it's rusted away
from the triangular flange.  Can I reattach this somehow or do I have to
replace the whole tube?

It's item #34 in the 75-78 section of this image:

Can someone explain what this rustyshroud seems to do?  I doesn't appear to
be part of the heating system.
