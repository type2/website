Subject: Suddenly no power-resolved! Kinda long...

List:

If you've been following this scenario, the power improved slightly
after I replaced the fuel filter ('78, 2 liter, FI).  The motor still didn't
have the power it did before so I did a (bastardized) test of the cat/con
suggested by a fellow list member:

1.  Drilled holes 'above' and 'below' the cat/con, sized for 3/8&quot; pop
    rivets.  
2.  I didn't really know how to measure flow so i used some 5-minute
    JB weld to glue some equal-length tubes over the holes (then chased
    the holes with a long drill to make sure nothing got in them).
3.  I took a hand-held wind meter (that uses the &quot;floating ball&quot; indicator)
    and took highly non-scientific readings at various throttle settings
    both above and below the cat/con.  RESULTS: slightly lower flow on
    the exhaust side of the cat/con but not that much.  The flow appeared
    the same in both positions regardless of rpm.  I thought that the flow
    would most likely be different at the point where the rpms &quot;flattened&quot;
    out.  Pretty close but always slightly less on the exhaust side of the
    cat/con
4.  Put some &quot;slow&quot; JB Weld (I think it seals better and is stronger) on the
    holes and pulled the pop rivets in place.  I then put a dab of JB over
    the &quot;test&quot; areas to make sure I don't have any leaks.  Can hardly see
    it but I'm still glad I did it on the &quot;engine&quot; side of the cat/con...

OK, now I'm feeling pretty confident this is related to fuel flow.  I shake
the car/tank, drain the gas (only a few specs came out) and reinspect the
filter.  It seems to be more &quot;slow&quot; than last week.  I install a second new
one.  I also take a look on the intake side of the fuel pump.  There is a
little black flakey thing visible so I spray cleaner every where I can and
replace the hose.  Hook everything back up and it seems better yet!

During its rpm struggles,  the motor wouldn't start if fully warmed up.
It now starts instantly (as usual). Also, the oil light would come on
which I attributed to a fuel flow-related struggle for rpms. Took the
bus for a long drive.  Start and runs fine.  New symptom seems to be
that it runs a little ratty until it warms up for a couple of minutes AND
and that oil light comes on almost as bad.  Maybe its just the quart of
semi-synthetic I put in anticipating the below-zero weather..

Thanks for all the input and tips, I think I used them all!

Any further ideas or post-hoc analyses always appreciated,
