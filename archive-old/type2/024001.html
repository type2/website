Subject: 2.0 upper end on a 1.8 crankcase???
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

More on the China Cat saga...When I found that the upper end was trash on the 
1.8 FI engine in my son's 75 Westy, I went looking for another engine. Well, 
I found another 75 engine and bought it. Turns out that it's a 2.0L. 

I know that the cylinders and heads will *fit*, but I can't figure out how 
the extra 5mm of stroke in the 2.0 was arranged. If I put the 2.0 upper end 
on the 1.8 crank/case, etc. will there be an extra 5mm of deck height?

Maybe a better question...Is there any way to make this work?

TIA and Cheers/Don Carron
