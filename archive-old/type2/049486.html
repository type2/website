Subject: [T2] on the road again

Hey all...
             The saga of the blue smoke continues...
Dropped the engine last week and replaced the #4 cylinder which had
failed...burned a nice little channel along the side where the oil was
shooting out at the rate of 1 quart every two miles (AMHIK)...replaced said
cylinder and head with spares I had lying around...she smokes a little now,
much less than last week (sure wish I had changed out the #3 cylinder
too...next time...)
             Question: can a 3/4 side head be used on the 1/2 side (or vice
versa?)

Thanks for the bandwidth...this list is invaluable!!! and each
teardown/rebuild gets easier every time!

                                                          smoking only half
a pack a day now!
