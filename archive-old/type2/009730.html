ok, here's the scoop...i just bought a '73 bus for $400...the body is in 
damn good condition (minor rust on body and floor) considering it hasn't 
been run in nine or ten years...the guy had it stored in back of his shop 
for all that time...he drove it back there, and then it just sat...what are 
some problems i might have in trying to get it running??  i'm not sure 
exactly what kind of shape the engine is in...or throttle cables 
etc...there's basically no corrosion underneath the bus, just a lot of 
spider webs and crap like that...the engine is not rusted at all, and it 
appears that everything is intact..also, there's a little lid in the middle 
of the floor in back that opens up to a spout type thing...what is that??  
it looks like something is filled through there, but i know it's not brake 
fluid...oh yeah...and if anyone can point me in the right direction as to 
how to replace the lower guide for the sliding door, i'd be forever greatful 
as the sliding door can currently only close about halfway...one more 
thing...it's got a sunroof too, and i'm afraid to try and open it...it's a 
little crusty and stuck...how exactly does it work??  does it slide up 
between the headliner and roof???  any comments, suggestions, prayers would 
be greatly appreciated...
