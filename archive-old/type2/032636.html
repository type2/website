Subject: Re: shifting problems, please help

[...]

 &gt;  I
 &gt; know have bad slips and jerks, especially in 2nd, (never got to 4th in
the
 &gt; neighborhood). what happens is it'll buck and lose power, and I have to
 &gt; press the clutch and rev the engine to keep it from dying. The problem is
 &gt; more pronounced going uphill, and is very bad in second, not so bad in
  &gt; 1st/3rd. I found that if i held on to the shifter in second, the problem
 &gt; would go away, but only if i held it just right.
 &gt;
 &gt; had a look under the bus after browsing the archives a little bit and saw
 &gt; that the shifter linkage was a little &quot;bent&quot;. it looked sorta wavy as
 &gt; opposed to being a straight pipe. nothing &quot;looked&quot; broken to me, but of
 &gt; course i know nothing about transmissions.

 The front tube is made &quot;bent&quot;. I don't believe this is your problem.
 Sounds more like you have a ground strap problem where it mounts to the
 transaxle and possibly a front trans mount problem.
