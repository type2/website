Subject: Re: [T2] i got stopped by someone from sirius radio while
  driving my bus

For what it's worth, it always makes me cringe that buses are always
associated with the Greatly Dreadful. My first exposure to buses and VWs in
general was while living in Hawaii. It was a common vehicle for surfers as
well as families.

I have never been a fan of the &quot;flower-child&quot; culture but have had a serious
&quot;obsession&quot; with buses of all years and types for quite a while now.

Call me a snob or whatever, but I think the use of a Bay in &quot;Little Miss
Sunshine&quot; was a MUCH cooler use of a classic (and fairly uncommon) vehicle.
