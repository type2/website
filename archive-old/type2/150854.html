Subject: Re: [T2] GWB with its top off - POR-15 it...

POR-15 may seem quite expensive at $30/qt, but if you are careful, it will 
go a long way.  With one quart and about 20 small 1&amp;quot; foam brushes (6 for a 
buck on sale) and one 2&amp;quot; chip brush, I was able to cover the outside of my 
'78 slider, both tracks where the door rests, a FULL set of cooling tin, a 
front floor on my '72 and numerous smaller areas, and many other misc pieces 
(fans, oil filer tubes, whatever...

I had the wife save up a bunch of 8 oz glass jars.  I filled 4 of these 
jars, and a small 4 oz jar.  The POR-15 will keep for a bunch of months (I 
started in August).   Fill the jars as much as you can.  The air that 
becomes trapped in the container is your enemy.  Use part of a plastic bag 
between the jar and the lid.

I am on my last jar.  This jar is 80% empty.  To keep the air OUT of the 
jar, I take my small, plastic fold over sandwich bag and form it into the 
mostly empty container to almost line the inside, and forcing out as much 
air as I could.  Then I wrapped the edges of the sandwich bag over the lip 
of the jar, and screwed the lid back on.


People will tell you that there is no way to remove POR-15 from you skin, 
except with abrasive action or the POR-15 solvent.  I will tell you that I 
cleaned my 2&amp;quot; chip brush so thoroughly that I was able to reuse it again one 
month later.  I will tell you that if you get to the POR-15 within 10 
minutes of notice, then the POR-15 will come off like magic.  If you wait 30 
minutes, the POR-15 will come off your skin, but it will take some effort.  
And POR-15 can be stripped from your skin with a strong bonding tape.  I 
used the plastic 2&amp;quot; mailing tape, and kept ripping off the POR-15 from my 
nose.  On time I put a flesh colored band-aid over a spot (just the tape).  
When the tape came off during my shower, so did the POR-15.

WD-40 will work....

Believe it or not.

I use a paint stripper wheel on my 3/8&amp;quot; drill.  It is like a wire mesh.  It 
will wear out.  I also have a 4.5&amp;quot; grinder, but I would suggest the paint 
stripper wheel for your work.  It will go fast....  And make a mess all over 
your garage!!   About $8 at Home Depot, or $6 on base.

Use a small can of the fiberglass that cures when it is exposed to UV of the 
sun.  You don't have to mix anything, and it will make a nice filler.  But 
you will have to get the sun on it to cure it.  No need for the fiberglass 
mat.  This stuff will sand off real good with your paint stripper wheel, and 
you can form it pretty smooth (before it dries, of course!!)  by laying some 
plastic sheet (or heavy duty wax paper) over the fiberglass and pressing 
with your fingers or rolling with something like a pencil.  Or running a 
putty knife over the plastic / wax paper.  ABout $12-$15 for a small pint.  
If you like it,buy more.

Do not use OSPHO, or phosphoric acid near your auto paint.  OK, white paint 
is all right, but if the OSPHO gets a chance to whiff over to your better 
cars, it WILL change the color of your paint (OK, but remember, 'white' is 
not a color; it is the absence of color).  It may take a few days for it to 
become visible, but you will see smatterings of different colored spots on 
your orange / black / blue / green / red... car

Good Luck.  This IS a cheapo way.
