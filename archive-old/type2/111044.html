OK let's start from scratch (anyone feel free to add in here). Just
fill in exactly the below to start from.

Vehicle : 1971 Type 2
Engine: 1600 Dual Port
valve clearance:
entire distributor number: ??? ??? 055
timing at idle speed:
dwell in degrees:
spark plug gap &amp; model:
vacuum at idle:
Carb: 34 PICT-3
Carb jet sizes (if you know them):
fuel pressure:

Let's start there. this will give everyone doing long distance
diagnostics some needed info
