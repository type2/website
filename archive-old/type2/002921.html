I have just about lost it over this problem. I just made some changes today.
Taking advice from the many on the list who offered suggestions, I decided
to install a deep sump to give the engine an oil capacity of 5 quarts. Also
the oil was switched from the 20W-50 it previously was running, to straight
40W. The timimg was adjusted to 10 degrees BTDC. After these changes a test
run was in order, so I took it up the highway, and after about 15 minutes at
55 mph the oil light came on telling me we were hot again. After cursing, I
turned around and headed back, this time at full throttle, all the while
thinking if the engine blew, I would get out, take off the license plates
and walk home never to return again. When I got it home and in the garage, I
let it idle for a minute and there was a sputter every couple of seconds
like a faint backfire.
Here's my setup:
Brand new DP 1600 from VW Mexico. (approx. 400 miles now)
New heater boxes (Bus Depot)
New stock exhaust (Bus Depot)
New Solex H30/31 PICT carb (freshly tuned per Barb and Eric)
New intake manifold.
Oil-Bath air cleaner
New 009 mechanical advanced distributor (timed to 10 degrees BTDC)
Petronix Ignitor ignition
New Blue coil
New generator
Rebuilt stock fuel pump
'71 engine tin stripped and painted/ no thermostat, vanes wide open
New engine compartment seals
New Yokohama 356's 32 PSI in each
New plastic hoses from shroud to heater boxes (Gene Berg)
New dipstick temp. sensor (Gene Berg)
91 octane fuel
At 350 miles I changed the oil, adjusted the vales, adjusted the idle with
tach/dwell meter to 900 RPM. Now I've added a new deep sump, changed to 40W,
and timed it to 10 degrees BTDC. Actually I've tried a variety of timing
settings. Also tuned the carb like Barb and Eric says. This bus is starting,
idleing, and running very smoothly. I've been working on this problem way
too long, and am losing interest in it quickly. If I can't figure it out
soon, it's going to the mechanic, and if he can't figure it out, it will
become the next owner's problem. Any more ideas? What could I be
overlooking? This problem is definately not a lack of dumping money into it.
