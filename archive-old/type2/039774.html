Subject: RE: Tool question

Hello,
	Well, I'm no mechanic, but I can relate my experiences with a couple of
questions.

	1. Brand of tools: Well, I wouldn't buy anything less than Craftsman.  I
can't tell you how many philips screwdrivers and socket sets I have
destroyed.  But, since I bought Craftsman stuff, I haven't had nearly the
problems.  There is better stuff out there, without question, but I can
afford Craftsman.  The other good thing about Craftsman is the fact that you
can take a 30 year old busted wrench into Sears and get a new one without
question (usually).

	2.  6 point sockets all the way!  The twelve pointers tend to round out on
the inside much easier, especially if the nut is slightly rounded as well.
I have three (granted cheap) 12 point socket sets inwhich several of the
sockets are unusable because they are basically round on the inside.  Oh,
and stay away from the 1/4&quot; drives as they just tend to be too weak to be
useful (i've snapped the square part on them)

	3. Always have a set of sockets and a set of wrenches on hand.  When
pulling my exhaust apart, I had to use both, and there are just too many
other times when I couldn't get into the bolt with a socket and had to use a
wrench, or vice versa.  It is just a good idea to have both.

Here is a list of tools I would purchase and have in the bus at all times.

1 set of screwdrivers (the Craftsman 14 piece set is great for me)
1 3/8 inch socket wrench
short and long extensions for socket wrench (I think I have the 3&quot; and 6&quot;)
10-19 mm 6 point regular depth socket set for 3/8&quot; drive
10-19 mm 6 point medium depth socket set  (never had use for deep sockets,
yet)
22 mm socket for your steering wheel lock nut (I hope that is right size,
this is from memory)
Spark Plug socket (13/16&quot; I believe) with the cool rubber insert thingy
1 set of wrenches, 6-19 mm open one side, closed the other
1 6 mm allen wrench (or the twelve point equivilent)  CV joints, etc.
Good set of flat vice grips
Duct Tape

	I know I am forgetting something, but I am 30 miles from my bus.  I'm sure
some of the other liesters will help you out here.  I say again, there is
really much better stuff out there than Craftsman, but it is affordable and
guaranteed, and pretty strong, too.  Oh, and this doesn't include major
engine tools or spare parts, just the stuff I would keep in the bus always.

	I would also invest in a good timing light, tach/dwell meter, and a good
quality compression guage for those at home tweakings.  I hope all of this
helps.  I have brought back my bus from the living dead with just these
tools and a lot of liquid wrench and grease!

Good luck,
Daniel Cathey III

Subject: Tool question


Ok, so I've finally gotten frustrated with not having the right tools to
work on my bus, and my birthday is coming up, so I have a couple of tool
questions for the list (and will probably start a religious war in the
process).  This is mostly regarding sockets, screwdrivers, wrenches and
simple automotive test equipment.

1. What brand of tools have you found to be reasonably (everthing is
relative here) priced but built well enough that you won't have to worry
about snapping your wrench in half getting those exhaust bolts out?

2. What's the big deal between 6 point sockets/wrenches and 12 point
sockets/wrenches?  Why would I want to have one over the other, or both?

3. How often (if ever) am I going to need deep sockets or universal sockets
or crowfoot wreches or anything beyond the basic socket/extension/handle
configuration?

Thanks all,
Niall

'76 Westy (Frances) currently sans engine - and yes, for those who are
interested, the case was quite cracked and throwing oil into the fan
housing.  Even the magnesium fan housing was somewhat cracked.  Looks like
this baby had been baked by the PO.  A rebuilt AVP engine is on it's way to
me as we speak.
