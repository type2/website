After a second rebuild on The Folly's carbs, I'm pleased to report that she
runs better than ever!!  BUT she idles way too quickly.   The idle
adjustment on her left hand PIDSIT carb in the dual carb setup on the 1700cc
motot, seems to have little effect.   Any suggestions as to what I should be
looking for now??

Please and thank you as always!!

Barry.
