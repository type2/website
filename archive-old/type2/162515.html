Subject: Re: [T2] Which accelerator cable to use??

&gt; I envision that if I attempt to install the carb + manifolds setup in my FI
&gt; '78 that I will need a similar adjustment in the length of my accelerator
&gt; cable.  Currently, my '78 cable stops at the throttle intake.
&gt;
&gt; Can I replace the '78 accelerator cable with another acelerator cable, like
&gt; the '73 - '74??  Is that longer/long enough??
&gt;
&gt; If not, are there any suggestions for adding a removable extention to the
&gt; end of my '78 accelerator cable for about 6&quot;.  The PO had permanently


because of the drop floor in mine the acc cable had to be lengthened
abouut 6 inches, and the extension was at the front buy using a rod with a
barrel connector on it.
