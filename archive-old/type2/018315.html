Here in Ventura, about an hour north of you, is a cool little place called
Roscoe Auto Salvage on Dubbers Way. Tons of VW stuff crammed into a mere
couple of acres.

While you're there you can stop next door at Art City and get a chunk of
travertine marble or go down a few blocks to Real Cheap Sports, the local
Patagonia outlet.
