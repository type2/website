Subject: Mo-Kan Show

As soon as I get off work will be heading to Independence for the Mo-Kan
show with NQ.  I will be in a 74 Standard beater bug and NQ will be in his
bus.  Hope to meet some more of you as I met a few last week at the
Springfield Missouri show.
Two shows in two weeks!!!!
Just like the west coast!!!!
