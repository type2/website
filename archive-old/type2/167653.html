&gt; &gt; Do I need to purchase a tank and then fill it? Where might I get one? I saw
&gt; &gt; one at Harbor Freight, but the tank was $79! And that was still empty!
&gt;
&gt; Find your local gas supplier.
&gt; They will list their options for own/rent and refill/exchange.
&gt; And find an alternate supplier who will swap/refill their tanks.
&gt; Generally, you purchase small tanks and rent the big ones.
&gt; You will trade off convenience and price. Small tanks are portable,
&gt; large tanks are cheaper on refill per cu.ft.


just stumbled accross a reciept for some Acetylene, for a 40cu ft tank , a
little one.  it was $40 for the gas, then they charged me $135 for the new
tank, but immediately credited me $135 for my exchange tank.

not sure if that is the going rate for a tank or just what they used for
accounting....
