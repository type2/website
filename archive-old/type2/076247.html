Subject: Re: [T2] Carburetor Icing (was: FI vs. Progressive carb)

Chuck,

Your 32-60 temp and 32-60 humidity match my rule of thumb, tho here in the
DC area, I think I have gotten it at higher temps.  Of course, moving as
you have from the warm dry SoCal area to Vancouver Island in Washington
State, I'll bet you will have an opportunity to test my theory at higher
temps... presuming you ever see a temperature over 60 :-)

Good call on the venturi...  I had not thought of that as the missing
ingredient between a carb and FI.  I never took the system apart when it
was iced, so I don't know *where* in the system the ice appeared.  The
pressures would, of course, drop even further in the low pressure zone of
the venturi which might push the critical point over the edge.
