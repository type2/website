&gt; Are you talking about &quot;torque sticks&quot; that are used with an impact wrench?
&gt; If so, they aren't really to be trusted.  They aren't all that accurate to
&gt; begin with and, since each impact wrench is different, the torque sticks
&gt; have to be specifically designed for the impact wrench.  Use the wrong set
&gt; of sticks and the torque value will be way off.

I suspect they have torque sticks but on my cars at least they use a
genuine torque wrench, usually the clicker kind.
