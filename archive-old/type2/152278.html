Subject: Re: [T2] Cutting out at high RPMs: '77 Bus

In '77 (and probably some other years) the California version (which is
what I have) does not have the rev. limiting rotor, for some reason. The
federal version *does*. Strange. I had to look this up just to confirm.

I went to the junk yard, and pulled a distributor out of a '75...also
grabbed the coil as well. Turns out, the '75 uses a 012 distributor, and
the 77 Cali uses a 093. Oh well.

Anyone need a 012 distributor? According to the web, they are quite
spendy. I'll sell cheeeeeeep. ;-)

&gt; do you have the speed limiting rotor, it could be malfunctioning or it may
&gt; be working properly your just overreving.
