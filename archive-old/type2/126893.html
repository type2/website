&gt; State inspection is coming up and my high beams won't go off.  I looked at
&gt; the turn signal switch and saw that two brown wires have pulled off the
&gt; switch.  This is on a '71 bus.  I looked at the wire diagram and it looks
&gt; like  a single wire goes to the high-low beam relay.  Is there any way I can
&gt; bypass the switching of high to low from the turn signal switch?

The switching is handled through a relay in the bottom of the fuse block.
Yours is probably shot (windshield leaks tend to fill them with water)
and a simple replacement will probably fix the problem.  The wire from the
switch simply sends pulses of current to the relay to toggle it from high
to low.

IIRC, the commonly-available relays are not identical to the OEM relays
and you have to solder a jumper between two pins of the relay to make it
function correctly.  I did this years ago and memory is fuzzy.  It would
also be a good idea to drill a small drain hole in the relay &quot;can&quot; so
that any water that gets in can drain out in the as-mounted inverted
position.
