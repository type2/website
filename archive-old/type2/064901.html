I always let all my cars idle for about a minute or two before taking 
off (up to 5 minutes for the air cooled ones), while I wipe off the 
windows, etc, but I've read it isn't necessary. Conley, in his 72, would 
NEVER take off before the temp gauge started moving. He said it was the 
only way to insure he didn't blow his (add on) oil pump... and he drove 
that same van for over 20 years.

Just a matter of what works best, I suppose.
