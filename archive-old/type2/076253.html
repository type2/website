Subject: Re: [T2] Carburetor Icing (was: FI vs. Progressive carb)

Carburetor Icing has been addressed by GM for years by preheating the
intake manifolds, I recall heated intakes on Mercedes 190SL intake
manifold and my MG Midget and although I cannot be specific I believe
that I've seen aluminum spacer blocks for a variety of SU, AMAL and
Weber. These spacer blocks can be heated by water flow, exhaust gasses or
just a copper tube wrapped around something hot that can cause convection
air flow. You'd be surprised how effective a set of double gaskets can be
in changing the temperature of your throttle body. In days of old 40
Fords we simply taped the heater hose to the fuel line and it preheated
the fuel enough to solve the problem. Your fix may be that simple.

&gt; Steve,
&gt; I'll add my .02 here. What your refering to is Bernoulli's 
&gt; principle,
&gt; something familiar to pilots,especially here in the great white 
&gt; north. Its
&gt; what keeps our planes in the air and also what causes our carbs to 
&gt; ice. Its
&gt; the constant of total energy, i.e. as air flows thru your carb, it 
&gt; has to
&gt; speed up as it passes thru the venturi, as it speeds up it's 
&gt; pressure
&gt; decreases (speed and pressure have to remain constant) as it losses 
&gt; pressure
&gt; it cools. Carb icing is a component of ambient temp and the dew 
&gt; point and
&gt; happens at a lower temp than you would suspect. My chart show it to 
&gt; be most
&gt; likely at a temp of around 32 to 60deg F and a dew point of between 
&gt; also 32
&gt; to 60 deg F. btw this is on av gas and is for severe icing so you 
&gt; can see
&gt; icing would have started at a higher temp. So the short story is if 
&gt; you've
&gt; got a coolish day and a fair amount of humidity, you'll have icing. 
&gt; I think
&gt; here is where FI would be a benefit,as without a carb you don't have 
&gt; a
&gt; venturi and you don't have a problem.

&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, what are the symptoms of carb icing, and what 
&gt; environmental
&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions cause it?  I had only heard of this phenomenon in
&gt; &gt; &gt; airplanes!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, it's like this... there is a thing called &quot;Charles Law&quot; which 
&gt; states
&gt; &gt; that the temperature of a gas is affected by its pressure.  Heat 
&gt; pumps and
&gt; &gt; air conditioners run on it.  If you compress a gas, it heats up.  
&gt; if you
&gt; &gt; make it less dense, it cools down.  In the throat of your carb and 
&gt; out the
&gt; &gt; intake runners, there is (or ought to be) a substantial vacuum. 
&gt; This
&gt; &gt; decreas in pressure causes the temperature of the air to fall.  As 
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; falls, the moisture in it condenses out and can freeze onto the 
&gt; walls of
&gt; &gt; the manifold.  As the throat of your intake manifold gets filled 
&gt; with ice,
&gt; &gt; you &quot;run out of air&quot;.  While running out of air is the opposite of 
&gt; running
&gt; &gt; out of gas, it feels about the same.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My rule of thumb on carb icing is that if relative humidity  
&gt; equals or
&gt; &gt; exceeds temperature, then carb icing can happen.  That is, at 60% 
&gt; humidity
&gt; &gt; and 60 degrees fahrenheit or 80% humidity and 80 degrees 
&gt; fahrenheit, you
&gt; &gt; can get problems.  I have not seen this elsewhere, and I don't 
&gt; *know* it's
&gt; &gt; true, but I have had icing problems *way* above freezing.  The 
&gt; middle
&gt; &gt; atlantic States can run 90/90 humidity/temps in the summer and 
&gt; carb icing
&gt; &gt; can  be a problem year 'round.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; VW gets around the ice problem on the T1 engine by piping some 
&gt; heat up
&gt; &gt; from the exhaust to heat the intake manifold.  On the dual carb 
&gt; engines
&gt; &gt; ('72-74), (a) the intake manifold is too short for this to be a 
&gt; problem
&gt; &gt; and (b) the gasket you use is a thin metal one, which means that 
&gt; heat is
&gt; &gt; transferred directly from the head and heats the intake manifold.  
&gt; On the
&gt; &gt; FI engines... well... it's magic (and you can quote me on that! :) 
&gt;  I
&gt; &gt; think that the mixture of gasoline and air (with humidity) is 
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; saturated than the air with humidity alone and has a greater 
&gt; tendency to
&gt; &gt; drop ice crystals.  I know I had severe icing problems on both the 
&gt; single
&gt; &gt; carb T4 conversion I drove for a day or two and the bugs I drove 
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; aftermarket mufflers that didn't supply intake manifold heat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The thing that I know is that my experiences with the bugs that 
&gt; had no
&gt; &gt; manifold heat and the one bus with the carb conversion were not 
&gt; happy
&gt; &gt; ones.  After a while they acted very much like they were running 
&gt; out of
&gt; &gt; gas or had a clogged gas  filter.  Very sluggish acceleration, 
&gt; bucking.
&gt; &gt; I have never experienced this on an FI engine, so the FI must deal 
&gt; with it
&gt; &gt; somehow.  I maintain... magic!  But if George or another 
&gt; physics-wise list
&gt; &gt; member wants to expound, I would love to listen!
