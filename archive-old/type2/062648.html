Just remember that if you want to run a laser printer you'll need an
inverter that provides *true* sine-wave power; a standard inverter (which
provides square-wave power) tends to cause them to burst into flames when
you try to print.  There are enough fire hazards in our busses without
adding flaming computer equipment to the mixture. :)
