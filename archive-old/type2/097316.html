Subject: Re: [T2] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

I live not to far from the BMW plant in South Carolina.
They have a museum with everything from Pre-war race cars, motorcycles,
aircraft motors to art cars. just awesome. The pride in the old cars and the
past of BMW is everywhere.Check it out at : http://bmwzentrum_dot_com/

there is also a BMW website that has a search engine to see what happened in
BMW history on a certain date, it also has gobs of info on their vintage
cars and links to other sites.

Just yesterday I was looking in the new WCM catalog and all the vw emblems
on hubcaps were deleted with the captions &quot;with emblem&quot;
 later,
 Bryan
