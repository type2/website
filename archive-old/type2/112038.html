&gt; Watching my temp gauge, it seems it runs coolest at the lowest speed you

&gt; our 78 high milage engine, that's about 50-55 on the flats! I've gotten
&gt; it to a scary 270 on long hill pulls even with shifting down, because of
&gt; the tendency for one to use the top of the rpm range in the lower gear-
&gt; best to settle in at the lowest rpms you can use, which is hardly moving
&gt; the throttle very far.

For those with fully instrumented engines, I wonder if there are different
peaks for oil and cylinder head temperatures?  It's the cylinder head temp
that causes mechanical problems for the engine, such as broken and/or
pulled studs.  The oil temp is just a symptom and may not follow along
precisely with the cylinder head temp.
