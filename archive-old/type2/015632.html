&gt;I want to thank all who responded to my clutch questions.  I changed the
&gt;slave unit this morning with no cure of the problem.  BTW, changing the
&gt;slave was a major PITA.  

I hope you did a visual inspection of the slave movement before replacing
it. It only needs to move the end of the lever 10 mm or so to disengage the
clutch. If it is moving that far, then the problem is likely in the clutch.
Throwout fork bent/broken or plate springs or fingers foul. Could also be
associated with the pilot bearing coming apart and binding the mainshaft.
Plan to replace anything that is worn. If the cross shaft fingers are worn,
have a machinist regrind the ends in parallel. Watch out for Mexican
replacement shafts that are garbage out of the box. 

I agree remounting the slave is a real PITA and requires a never-say-die
attitude with a good measure of aptitude in play.
