Subject: Bus Tires a Canadian perspective

I think we're splitting straws here gang....

The original Michelin ZX that came on these babies, and the Continental
equivalent were spec from the factory at 94R....In fact there was an
agreement
for Michelin and Continental to continue to make these tires to the VW
spec
for 10 years following the end of production...both have continued well
beyond
that due to the Vanagon era, with tread design improvements, and model
number (MX) changes up til today...

Properly inflated, these tires make a wonderful drive and ride
improvement,
don't they Dave..we talked Dave (Shutterbug, Breakdown,Skeeter Dave)
into
putting a set on his bus just before we left for everybus...he couldn't
stop
commenting on how well they handled....unfortunately, a PO did some
handywork
that we missed, and his engine gave out on the way home....but the tires
were
great!!!

Current versions of both are 94R rated...the Continentals we bought last
week,
and the Michelines we bought last spring...

Good bussing all !!!
