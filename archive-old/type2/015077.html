&gt;Ok, for those of you who are running Loafs with a 1700cc (stock motor),
&gt;dual 34 ICT Webers, and 009 distributor; what size jets are you
&gt;running in your carbs??? These things are driving me crazy!! I just want
&gt;to drive my bus without hearing a pop, kick, or flatspot. Right now,
&gt;I am running 135 mains with 60 idles. I started with 130 mains and  52
&gt;idles (right out of the box) 

Try 60/140.  And check the emulsion tubes as well. I can't remember which
application used it, but a very common emulsion tube can really make a
difference. Low F 7's, as I recall, maybe even an #F 7.

Ian Cameron, long ago carb mechanic, Webers and SU's.
