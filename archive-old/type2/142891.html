Subject: The Good, the Bad, and the Leaky

&quot;New&quot; fuel pump has been vapor locking on me since the temps started
going over 90. Cracking the hose clamp at the pump releases a hissing
noise then everything's copasetic again.

So. Sick of dealing with the thing, and not wanting to drop a benny or
more on a new mechanical pump, I decided to go ahead and try an
electric pump. Since this is more of an experiment than anything, I
just got a cheapie Facet pump.

You guys weren't kidding when you said it was loud! At idle when the
carb bowls are full it clacks like the hamsters have decided to play
the drums in the engine compartment. ;-)

Anyway, lately - tied in with the heat thing - I've been experiencing
a loss of power when the bus has warmed up. Cold everything's fine.
Checked for the typical: Vacuum leaks, coil, etc. New pump didn't
resolve it either. Oddly enough, with the new pump at full or nearly
full throttle at speeds over 55 or so I can feel fuel starvation
coming on. Interesting that fuel volume was NOT one of the reported
faults that I'd read about the Facet clack-o-matic.

Also, after a long freeway run the clack never came back. Like it was
needing to feed constantly and wasn't getting the lockdown from the
needle and seat valves in the carbs. I've also noticed a marked
decrease in mileage since the heat. From 22-ish mpg to 12-ish mpg. I
had chocked it up to the pump until now.

I'm currently leaning toward a stuck valve in the carbs. That would
explain the power drop off as well as the poor mileage. I'm just
gushing fuel into 2 of the cylinders. (Stock dual Solex carbs.)

Does my logic make sense?

I think it's time to tear down the one I rebuilt recently first and
see if that's the cause. Then move on to the other one if necessary.
Looks like I've got a busy day ahead of me tomorrow...
