&gt; just a nice preventative maintnance idea for the summer.. any input and past 
&gt; experiences would be appreciated .. thanks.. peace.. scott 71 vesty

if you want em for the looks that is one thing, but they are totally

  cooling air is for the most part &quot;S*CKED&quot; into the air intakes not
forced in.
