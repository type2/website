Subject: Re: [T2] Re:liquid repair for loose ball joints?

&gt;This classifies real close to the &quot; Ring Seal&quot; goop you squeezed from a
&gt;tube, into the spark plug holes to rebuild your engine--another miracle
&gt;in a can ( tube in this case ) that flopped--

Actually the engine rebuild in a can worked for about 50 miles or so. &lt;grin&gt;

I used to have an '84 CR-X that was suffering from worn rings and I drove 
it all over the place. I got it in Italy and it was cheap ($150) so I 
brought it back and drove it regularly from VA to TN to VA. Perfect car to 
leave on the pier while we were out to sea. Rust? WHO CARES? &lt;grin&gt;

Right before I left for TN I'd &quot;treat&quot; the engine. On the highway it would 
last much longer and my oil consumption would drop to almost nil. Around 
town though it lasted about 50 miles before it would smoke on decel and 
accel (and every time in between). So did it work? Yeah. was it worth it? 
No. Too temporary. I still see it in the FLAPS.

Would I do it to a motor I cared about? NO! &lt;grin&gt;
