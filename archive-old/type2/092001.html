Subject: Re: [T2] Sorry! Tire Questions.

Nick,

It seems to me that you can take your receipt and warrantee card back
and at least get a refund.  They should have put the tire serial numbers
on the warrantee card so that will prove that those are the tires they
sold you, and the work order receipt should show that you ordered four
load range D tires, not a mixed set.  Tell them they need to take the C
tires off and put the D's that you ordered on (mount and balance too) at
their expense.

Be nice at first, then if you don't get the proper response, talk to the
manager.  If you aren't satisfied then, take it up with the regional
manager (if it's a chain store) AND the Better Business Bureau.  Make it
clear that it's a safety issue besides being ripped off.

&gt; I put on Yakahama 356 tires awhile ago I was just going to rotate them
&gt; (back to front on the same side). I ordered four load range D tires.  I
&gt; just noticed that I have been ripped off, and they put on load range D on
&gt; the front and C on the back! I won't be able to take it in to get them to
&gt; give me the Ds that I paid for for a week or so, as I am going on roadtrip
&gt; tomorrow and have a lot to do before then.
