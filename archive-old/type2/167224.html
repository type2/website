Subject: RE: [T2] baptism in fuel

Bad new fuel pump in a Honda.  Since I just replaced the pump, must be clogged
fuel line.  Lying under the car in the Fire Dept parking lot.  Blew thru the
pickup line, and a shot of gas came back out straight up my nose, into my eyes
and mouth.  Blind and couldn't breathe.  Out from under the car in a tenth of
a second, pictured in my mind were the building and door was, pushed off from
the car with my arms outstreched untill I struck the building.  Clawed my way
down the side of the building untill I found somthing that felt like a door.
Beat on that sucker like Fred Flinstone.  Woke EMS up and went for a ride,
lights and everything.  Fun fun fun.JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62 404.1
