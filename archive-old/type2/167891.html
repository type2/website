Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure?

Hi, this engine was rebuilt almost a year ago, 2.0 L, F.I., I'm running 
15w40, the temp. in the mornings are around 0*c,the afternoons are 
around 20* c. Looking at the other posts, sounds like it is ok.
Thanks ,
Bernie

&gt;&gt; what oil weight?  what are the ambient temps outside in the mornings?
&gt;&gt; i may have missed previous emails,  is the engine stock?  without
&gt;&gt; knowing the oil in the engine and temps i don't know if this normal.
&gt;&gt; of course i'm still a novice.  during the winter last year w/ temps
&gt;&gt; near freezing i don't recall seeing pressure quite that high.  might
&gt;&gt; have been close though.  i was running mobil 1 15w50 syn.

&gt; I run mobil 1 15w50 syn in my 78 2liter engine bus all the time and I get
&gt; 70psi or so at start up and never seems to fall below 35psi sitting still
&gt; after a run on a hot day. and this is an engine with 100k on it.
