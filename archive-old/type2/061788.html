Subject: Heater controls.

Can anybody tell me how the heater controls work on an 83 Vanagon? (other
than very poorly)

I have an 83 air cooled with the fresh air fan. There are four (4) slider
controls on the dash and one (1) fan speed switch.

What I think I've figured out so far is that the top slider directs air
either to the windshield (Defroster/Defoggers), the heater (below radio) or
to the cabln heat duct behind the driver.

The next slider is for the temperature and controls the flapper valves.

The third slider is called a main flap control and I have no clue about its
function.

The fourth slider look as though it directs air to the vents along the roof
line in the passenger area.

Is this right or am I off on this. Does the fan switch have anything to do
with heated air at all? or is all hot (warm) air pushed along solely by the
engine fan.

Any help would be appreciated
