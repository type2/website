Subject: Re: [T2] JC whitney heat shield insulation

I have always thought that the aluminum side of Whitney's stuff should 
be on the inside.
Putting the foil against the outer bus metal might tend to promote 
condensation entrapment.
In fact I am almost &quot;sure&quot; that can happen.

In one's house, the paper vapor barrier is on the inside surface area.

Question(s):
When applying that Kool Koat stuff on the interior surfaces of  bus
outer walls, are we addressing the possible need for condensation
weepage/drainage, and does the Kool Koat stink up the bus with any asphalt
type stench during the hot Summer months?
