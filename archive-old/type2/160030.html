Subject: Re: [T2] troubles

Any chance you've got water in the tank? Autozone pump
ticking away tells me you're not running FI so it is
more susceptible to a drop of water now and then
(continuous flow keeps water suspended better.) Hows
the cap and elbow? -BaH PS Is it icing up?

 Well, the Bopmobile tried real hard to let me
downtoday.  She's been running great and the last time
I put oil in it was last month in Gulf Shores.  I did
 accidently over-fill it by about a half quart.  So
 this morning it was really cold, low 20's.  I had
 trouble keeping her running long enough to rev it up
 enough to where it would idle without dying.  Well,
 she finally wouldn't start at all.   So I figure
 I've flooded it.  Don't know that I've ever had that
 much trouble getting her started.
 
 So, I let it set for a while and try again.  Started
 right up.  So I let her sit and idle for a while to
 warm up.  Loaded up my dog and hopped in.  Just down
 the street it's like she's starved for gas.  So I
 check the fuel pump and it was softly ticking away. 
 This Autozone pump has outlasted any other I've had
 and it's extremely quiet.  Then I checked the fuel
 filters which had not been changed since I had the
 tank removed and boiled out a couple of years ago. 
 I have checked them periodically, however.  One did
 look like it didn't have much gas in it so I changed
 it.  Started her up and same trouble.  After several
 tries I got her limped home at which point she
 starts running perfectly.  I guess I hadn't run it
 enough to fill the new fuel filter.  What's weird is
 that it is the filter on the outbound side of the
 pump that clogged up.
