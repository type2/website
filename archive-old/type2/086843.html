Subject: front glass seal

Folks,

Does the seam on new front glass rubber go on the top or bottom of the
window?

My old seal was so bad, I couldn't tell.
BTW, this looks to be a serious job to just get the rubber on the window.
I've got it &quot;stretching&quot; right now as it was just incredibly hard to get
on the glass.  I've done bug front windows, no problem, but this one
requires some *serious* effort!


Cheers, dave
