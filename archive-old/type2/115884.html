Subject: Re: [T2] How do you set up your camp?

I have a '77 and an '82. Here's what's in 'the 82 Westy ('cause that's what
we're using these days.):

Behind driver's seat:
3D cell maglite
The backs from the director's chairs in the luggage rack
Windshield curtain

Sink locker:
Real tableware for two.
A sauce pan and a frying pan w/ lids
Tupperware
Coffee pot
Spatula and a couple knives and serving spoons.
Paper plates
A box of plastic tableware
Freezer Ziploc bag or ten
Canned food (Instant meal for about two meals)

Seat lockers:
Jiffy pop
Dry soup mix (Knorr's)
Baby wipes
TP x 3
Paper towels

Over sink:
Aspirin
Band aids and suture strips
Shaving gear
Hair brush
Tooth brush

Hanging locker:
Sweatshirts, jackets, clothing

Headache locker:
Dog biscuits
Dirty laundry

Under rear seat:
Lanterns (gas and electric)
Toolbox (tackle box containing the bare minimum tools to fix the bus at the
side of the road. Could pull the motor with it, but I'd need a jack that's
not onboard to put it back.)
Leveling blocks (4 x 12&quot; x 12&quot; x 1&quot; waterproof plywood)
2 stock Bilstein jacks
Duct tape
Empty 2 gallon water bottle to fill water tank with on the road
Presto log or two
20' nylon tow strap
Rear hatch screen

Laying on rear cushion:
Pillows
Sheets
Sleeping bags x 2

Rear locker:
Cameras
Engine specific tools
Couple quarts of oil
Jumper cables
Gallon of Dex-cool
Handful of shop towels

Over rear door:
VOM
10 &amp; 13 mm combination wrenches
Long needle nose pliers
5&quot; Vise-Grips.
Shore power cord
Misc. nuts, screws, bolts, short lengths of engine hose
Glow plug and correct relay
Injector

Hanging on back of passenger seat:
Basket for maps (sometimes lives between the seats)
Water jug (for ice)

And that's what's in it right this minute.

Before setting out, we add food and clothing for the climate we're heading
to.  Food goes in reefer, sink and seat lockers. Clothing goes in hanging
locker and headache locker. Lisa takes a small bag. It lives on the floor
when traveling and on the upper bunk when parked. If additional bedding is
needed, it goes on the bed.

We're not the most organized, but we usually have what we need with us. It
worked from Oregon to Ohio and back.

&gt; My question is with
&gt; all of this equipment how do you pack the bus and is there any room left
&gt; for you? I have never camped in a vw so any help is appreciated.
