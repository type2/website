Subject: Re: [T2] 55 mph speed limit

The manual in my carbed 71 Westy says that my top speed --- and cruising
speed --- is 65, but I try to keep it between 60 and 65, erring on the slow
side.
I'll have to plead ignorance about something I've inferred from earlier
postings within this thread: is it worse for FI Busses to travel at 70mph
than for stock carbed Busses?

As for speeding for safety, even on I-95 between NYC and Atlanta I
maintained 65 for hours on end without impeding traffic. Only once did I get
the one fingered salute, and that was a merging situation in DC.

&gt; The subtler point is that buses had inherent limitations that were
&gt; known and accepted when they were produced. We now drive them on
&gt; highways where the attitude is that limitations are for losers. The
&gt; temptation to push them to 70 mph and higher is strong, if only for
&gt; reasons of safety!
