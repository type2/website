&gt;The temperature here in SC is about 90 degrees during the day, and once my

For the weather and the speed you are going, it's about normal.  I agree 
with Jeff here - if you slow down to 65 the temp will likely drop 10-20 
degrees.

&gt;I
&gt;know the gauges are not 100 percent accurate........

They are more accurate than you think.

&gt;I need help on how to lower this temp, for it seems near the thermal
&gt;breakdown point of non-synthetic oil.....also thinking about switching to
&gt;synthetic for this reason.

I'm one of the people that likes synthetic.  I recommend switching if the 
price doesn't bother you.  How is your oil pressure?  CHT?  If those are 
both in line then I wouldn't worry too much about 240 with synthetic oil, 
but I certainly wouldn't let it get much beyond that.
