Subject: Black locking gas cap

I took a look at the black version of the Blau locking gascap today. It's
weird and I think it was probably designed for another vehicle.

Unlike the chrome one that you twist like the unlocking variety before you
lock it, you can only really secure the black version by locking it with the
key. The fit seems tight although you can rock the gap back and forth.

The cap is also the ventilated variety and is deeper. It still clears the
bird beak if you have a metal based restrictor for smog tests it won't fit.
