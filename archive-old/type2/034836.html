&gt; Aloha List,
&gt;     I am attempting to rejet my 34 pict 3 because of a noticeable
&gt; leaning out in the starting of acceleration of each gear.  I read an
&gt; article in some VW mag that I cannot remember the name of off hand, and
&gt; it said that to remedy this flat spot the idle jet needs to be
&gt; enlarged.  I have given the car a full tune up and checked the carb to
&gt; make sure that the accel pump nozzle isn't shooting the butterfly or
&gt; side of the carb.
&gt;      I am curious about how and when the different circuits work
&gt; specifically for this carb and I am curious about what jet sizes others
&gt; are running on their motors,  it would be greatly appreciated.  I have a
&gt; dual port 1776, with a 009, exhaust and a mild cam.  Not my choice,
&gt; that's how I bought it.
&gt;     Also is it possible to get a set of jets so that if I make a mistake
&gt; I can just replace them-the idle jet, air correction jet, main jet.
&gt;     Any input is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Mahalo,

i bet $1000 that you have more success removing the flat spot by
getting a used STOCK vacuum advance distributor.  try a salvage yard,
local they are like $10-15.  much cheaper and faster than messing with
your jets..(which you can still do later if you want)

find out which distributor you need, i have boxes of them...i might
have one you need.

**also get rid of the points.  electronic ign is the only way to go if
your engine is not stock, which yours isn't.  they cost about $50 or
less and you NEVER NEVER NEVER need to set the points, or timing
again.  not only that but the engine will run smoother and cleaner
cause the timing will stay DEAD ON FOREVER!!!!!

***note...NOT starting a flame with the elec.ign theme!!!
