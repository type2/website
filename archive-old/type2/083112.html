Subject: Re: [T2] Proposed Engine Swap

William,

As you can tell from the responses by Jason and Bus Gypsy, what you are
considering is fraught with peril.  I have answered your specific
questions below and have further thoughts at the bottom.

On Wed, 10 Apr 2002, William Ray wrote:

&gt; 1.  Will the 1979 2.0L, single carbed engine set up
&gt; for an automatic transmission fit into my 1972 manual
&gt; transmission bus?  He proposed swapping flywheels and
&gt; clutches and replacing the main seal.  From what I can
&gt; tell from Wilson is that the mounting can be done.

The '79 engine will mount in your '72 bus.  With the flywheel and pressure
plate from your '72, it will connect successfully with your trans.  The
largest hassle is that the '79 had one-year heater boxes.  If it is a
federal model exhaust and the heater boxes on this bus are good, use them
and you will be fine with a stock '72-4 muffler.  The fuel supply question
I will answer at the bottom.

If the heater boxes on this '79 are shot, then the deal is *very*
marginal, as '79 heater boxes are NLA and scarce as hen's teeth, so you
are talking new oval port heads just to be able to get an exhaust on it.

Someone has posted in the past that you can bolt oval port heater boxes to
a square port head, but I have grave doubts that this would work... anyone
out here done it? Did it work?

&gt; 2.  I will be returning to his shop tomorrow so we can
&gt; fire up the engine.  I would like to see the
&gt; compression numbers from the 2.0L at a minimum.  Is
&gt; there anything else obvious that I should ask him or
&gt; have checked out?

Compression is the biggest question.  A leak-down test would be better, as
it will tell you the condition of the rings.

Look for leaky push rod tubes.  *Most* engines will have at least a
couple, especially on a bus that is ready for parting, so it is not a
sure-fire deal killer, but if *all* the tubes, or even a substantial
majority, are leaking, it is a pretty good sign tha the amount of blow-by
in this engine is high, even if the compressions are good.

&gt; 3.  If I were to purchase a re-built engine, I would
&gt; likely be spending $500-700 more than I would for the
&gt; 1979 2.0L.  A 12,000 mile - 1 year warranty isn't
&gt; worth that much is it?

Warranties are worthless unless you are dealing with a local rebuilder.
It is not that various companies will not stand by their warranties (an
entirely different kettle of fish), but that the hassle of excercising the
warranty is so great tht you would probably prefer to gnaw your leg off to
avoid doing it.

I realize that this is an impossible piece of advice, but do your best to
choose a rebuilder from whom warranty service will not be necessary.   The
current &quot;list wisdom&quot; on this seems to favor Boston Bob and Jake Raby.

On your fuel supply situation....

You have three choices, as I see it.  Choice three depends on whether Mr.
Kelly decides he wants my FI system and if he is local/can arrange pickup.

Choice 1:  Use the dual carbs that you currently have on your '72.  I am
not a carb man, I love my FI, but the dual carbs will fit the '79 block
physically and with re-jetting should be able to keep up with the 2L
engine.  I would await confirmation from David Schwarze or one of the
other carb experts on the list, but I believe this will work and requires
no mods to your bus.

Choice 2: Use the single carb that is currently on the bus.  If you were
in Phoenix or San diego, not too terrible an option.  In Missoula, I will
ride with Jason and Bus Gypsy... you will have major problems in the
spring and fall with carb icing.  I advise against this option.

Choice 3: Install FI.  The up side to this is that it is the stock system
for the engine you are looking at.  It is reliable, it is efficient, it is
easy to install, it is damn near perfect, except....

(a)David Kelly is first in line for the system I currently have (which is
a '79 fed system) *if* he wants it and can pick it up or can arrange to
have it picked up and shipped to him.
(b) as I said in my original post, I will not ship.  Getting it from me to
you would be a bit of a problem.  If someone from Seattle is headed for EB
and can transport it, fine!

If my system craps out, then Joe at Busted Bus can probably set you up
with a system tho it would probably cost more than mine would... he is
probably less of a socialist than I am as he actually needs to eat off
what he makes selling parts :-)

If price were no object, I would advide door #3.  In your current
situation, probably installing the dual carbs with a rejet is your best
choice.  Try to sell the dual carb settup to someone in Phoenix :-)

BTW, you may well break even on this bus if the auto trans is any good...
they are quite salable on the used bits market, as are many other parts
from that bus.
