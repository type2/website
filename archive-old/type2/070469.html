Subject: Re: Re[2]: Some people just don't understand

I love German cars as used cars, but I can't imagine buying a new German
car today.  I just don't think the value is there.  For James  McGill's
need (multipurpose station wagon, nonhobby) I would look for a used
Accord wagon.  Not fast with the four, but very respectable handling and
a good highway cruiser.  All the Japanese cars I've owned over the past
12 years or so have needed I think ONE unscheduled maintenance trip *total*
for the whole group -- maybe 300-400thousand miles aggregate.  I don't
think even BMW or MB would do that, and certainly not at the price.
With 120,000 miles on a VW bus, you carry $200 in spares and $400 in
tools so that you can build a new VW bus in the Walmart parking lot when
it dies.  With 120,000 on a Honda, they give you a third of the purchase
price in trade on a new one, unless you want to keep on driving.

Don't get me wrong, I love my Vanagon, but I would no more drive to Inuvik
in it than I would attempt an Atlantic crossing with it.  And the flip side
is I would sooner swap the Vanagon's engine than change the oil on one
of the bulletproof Japanese appliance cars.  Two different animals.
