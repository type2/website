Subject: help! BA6 switch

I've got the BN4 installed and working and now all I have to do is get this
dash switch hooked up. Through the kindness of a list member, I now have a
really nice switch from (I think) a BA6 heater. It has a green knob with a
light bulb and temp written on the front with arrows indicating turning
clockwise. It clicks once when moved clockwise and then has a rheostat that
moves through about 270 degrees of arc. The body of the unit is about 2&quot;x3&quot;
and 2&quot; deep.

The problem is that there are 10 terminals on the back.  Does anyone know
the proper hook-ups. I think one is for switched power (while running), one
for unswitched power ( for the timer ) one for ground (?) and of course one
to go to the heater.

I can't seem to get the switch to change the voltage of any of the
terminals.
Any help would be most appreciated.
