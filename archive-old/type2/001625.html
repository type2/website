Subject: Re: [T2] child's cot brackets

Have to be a fairly small 9yo, manual for '75 gives a max of 90lbs. Think it
was less for earlier canvas, in any case I'd divide it in half due to age
and deteriation.

Subject: [T2] child's cot brackets


&gt; Could someone give me the measurements for installing the child's cot
&gt; brackets in the A &amp; B pillars? Scott was nice enough to include one in the
&gt; interior he sold me, and I'd like install it in Wendelin for 9-y/o Lauren
&gt; for when we go camping (and temporary storage when she outgrows it).
&gt;
&gt; BTW, Wendelin should be home in a week or so. The head is on its way back
&gt; to AVP and they've told me it's a one-day turnaround. I've been getting
&gt; pretty good response in the past couple of weeks, I'm really sittin' on
&gt; 'em. Hope to have the ol' girl back on the road shortly.
