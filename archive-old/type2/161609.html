Subject: trading time?

Hi all! I'm cleaning out my garage, so...

I have a z-bed (plaid cloth, in great condition: 1 small hole, slight fading 
on fabric); the cabinet beneath the z-bed - clean, needs re-gluing at one or 
two tongue/groove connections; a panel for what looks like it goes over 
where the stove and table go, AND the overhead and side closet compartments 
- pretty good condition - the overhead compartment had a little bit of water 
streaks on the inside, and part of the 1/8&quot; panel is loose (but fixable) on 
the side cabinet with the closet. All the pulls and locks are missing from 
it. I don't know the year - part numbers are on the bits at home: I can post 
those tomorrow (maybe w/ pics).

I'm looking for the rear-ender tent if possible.That's negotiable, though. I 
have the Transporter, and I'm not interested in switching out the interior. 
I'm happy removing the middle seat and folding down the back for camping.

These were an &quot;I'm sorry&quot; gift from my mechanic who took 3 weeks to do a 
4-hour job about 2 years ago. He wouldn't let any of his other mechanics 
touch my bus because he loves it so much. He had these stored in the attic 
of his garage. They came out of a westy that a mechanic who previously 
worked for him had. I have since cleaned them up and tested them all out - 
with the intent of using them myself - but I'm just not using them.

Stephanie
