Subject: Re: [T2] Plumbing &amp; Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

&gt; I see exactly what you are saying about the fuel pump
&gt; Bob. I just have a basic on off switch right now. I just used
&gt; an old defroster pull/push switch.

well unless you have a relay your switch will melt, those buggers use some
power AMHIK (Ask me how I know)

&gt; I tried to go back and refresh my self with the Late Model BN4
&gt; Demystified article in the library by Ron Van Ness and it is 
&gt; telling my the page is no good. Anyone else have this problem?
&gt; http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/bn4late.htm 
&gt; Did the address change, or am I nuts? I also, when running,
&gt; seem to get a heater exhaust smell in the cab while sitting
&gt; still. Does anyone have this problem. I have the plastic 
&gt; recirculation duct but not the metal one that attaches to the 
&gt; top and then to side of the bus cabin. Guess I need to make 
&gt; one and then cut a hole and attach it. Thanks everyone for all the help with this! :)

have you run the exhaust pipe out the side of the bus???  you should get
no smell except the hot air smell from musty ducts.

now I am extrapolating here since I don't have a BN4 but a BA4 and have
the manuals for it and also for the BA6 but they all run on the same basic
principle
