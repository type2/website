&gt; kidding!  

Kevin, et al.,

I find it in Section 4 (Electrical System), page 26 (but I've probably got
the Artscroll, not the KJV :-).  The instructions there are that dimension
&quot;a&quot; is the headlight's height above the ground.  Tho they are not
explicit, I would say they mean the center of the headlamp.  Note also
that they also want (A) half a tank of gas; and (B) a 70 kg (154 lb)
person in the driver's seat. Again, I would say the gas is not too
material and the person should be the normal driver.  If they are aiming
for an &quot;average&quot; with my van and I went by the book, I'd be way low.  
100kg person and usually &lt;1/4 tank of gas :-)

You've done enough.  Have you no sense of decency, sir?  
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
