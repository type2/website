To: VW Bus &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Volks:

In a recent European Car magazine they had a feature on a company in
So Cal that was putting 2.0L Golf motors in Vanagons.  The process is
CARB approved and appears to be very reliable.  I've had two cars with
that 2.0L motor and I can attest to it's reliability. (Golf with &gt;200K
miles and Jetta with &gt;120K miles)  Plus I drive like a raped ape just
like G. Matthew does.

The downside is that is costs around $5K for the conversion but aren't
new vanagon motors or good rebuilds close to that?

Just an idea.
