Subject: EGR filter rotted: replace or alternative?

The EGR filter on my '81 has rotted away. New ones are rediculously
expensive, and since I'm not in CA I'm not even sure I need one.

The ever inaccurate Bentley shows that I could get by with just a solid pipe.

Any suggestions?  I really don't want to buy a new filter.


Thanks,

James
