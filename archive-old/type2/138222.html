&gt;If you strip off the cheap paint and use a high temp
&gt;header paint or BBQ paint on them I think they'll
&gt;last a reasonable amount of time. Still not as long
&gt;as a stock muffler, but better than they way they
&gt;come out of the box.

FWIW I hope your luck is better than mine has been... 

Mine have vibrated apart in quick order. I think a year is the best I every got out of one... 

Actually the best I every got was the one I have on my Beetle. Bought it in 1994. Of course it became a barn queen about 1995... &lt;grin!&gt; Beetle was Type IV powered. 

The BBQ paint delays the rust but the paint won't last a year. Seems as thought he heat and road wash when it rains seems to kill it. Vibration and heat too.
