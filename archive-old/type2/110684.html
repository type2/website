&gt; how may races has BAR honda finished this year?

I've no idea, but I do know that Honda attacks engineering problems with a
passion.  When they decided to go F1 racing, they couldn't decide which of
two completely different engine configurations was best, so they built
both just to see.  When they decided to build motocross motorcycles, their
first offerings revolutionized the sport.  The 20-year-old Honda generator
in my garage always starts on the second pull regardless of how many
months it has sat.  My Honda XR600 has required nothing but oil, gas and
tires despite hard off-road use.

I could go on, but I think that you get the idea.  It perturbs me that
they would ignore the valve burning problem just because it occurs after
the warranty.  Maintainance schedules should be realistic.

George
