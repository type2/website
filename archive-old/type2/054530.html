Considering that the pressure plate is screwed solidly to the massive
flywheel, I don't see how uneven torques can make any difference as long
as they stay tight.

Now, _while_ you are tightening them down, you can warp things.  Snug them
up until the springs start to compress, then go round and round and
tighten each bolt a quarter turn at a time.  When the pressure plate
bottoms against the flywheel then get out the torque wrench and tighten
away.
