 If you stand in just a certain way, and
+AD4-twist your arm around in a really uncomfortable position and jam your
finger
+AD4-in there and twist it in ways it's not supposed to twist you can just
barely
+AD4-feel the end of the plug in there.  So, how would you possibly ever get it
+AD4-out?

This was my problem and there was another plug in there too. If you can
touch it, a pair of largish round nosed forceps ought to do the trick.
