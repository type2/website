Subject: heater - defroster cable

Hi All,

Does anyone have a source for a new replacement
control cable to the heater/defrost register on a 73'
or newer bus?

Mine decided to give up the ghost and with all the
weather we are having in the Willamette Valley
(Oregon) It's becoming an issue.

Thanks in advance!
