Hey, did anyone go to the spec page on these??

I want the transaxle in it..... it has a syncronizer on reverse gear!!!!

And I want all the seats out it..... it hauls 15!!!  people!!!
With a non-walkthru bench seat bus, that gives you 3 in the front; add a full width middle seat, that gives
you 3 more; then the full seat in the back, that is 3 more for a total of 9.  Where do they stash the other
6??
