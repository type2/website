Hi John,

'73-'74 front seats will slide right into the '68-'72 front seat 
rails.  Late '75-'79 rails are different.  '73 seats have the proper tubes 
for the headrests built into the seat backs, but the headrests themselves 
weren't always included.  So, your best bet is to find seats from a '74 bus 
(headrests were standard equipment by then).  Possibly an early '75 will 
also do the trick, but the '74 is a sure bet.   I'm using front seats from 
a '74 in my '71.

&gt;As the veteran of two head on crashes (no, didn't cause either and yes, both

&gt;head rests.  My PO cobbled together a set and fitted them to the stock
&gt;seats, but they were so lame I took them off.  It's a nice clean look, but
&gt;I'm pretty fond of my neck vertebra, and walking in particular.  What have
&gt;others done to fill the gap and still have stock seats?
