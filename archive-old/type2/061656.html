Subject: '73 Questions

Hey Volks-
I have a '73 Westy in my garage, that I'm attempting to put on the
road. I don't know much about it, but I do know that it spent it's
first few years in Germany. It has all of it's papers, including the
Hamburg dealers' service stamps up to the 25K mile service. From there
it went to B.C. for a while and looks as if it found it's home in
Indiana. The speedometer reads MPH, I assume that this was an after
market retrofit. It has a double bed up top(remember, this is a
'73)and gold fabric including center stool and it even has a kids
cot(over front seats)in great shape.
I have the engine out right now and I'm going to clean it up and do a
little re-torquing while I have it out. Before removal I got _at_120 +/-5
all around, is this decent for the type 4? . I'm not terribly familiar
with the type 4 engine and have a couple of questions:
First- On the #1&amp;2 head(as I remember... car isn't in front of me)
there are two long studs that come out on either side of the intake
manifold, they appear to be some sort of ports or something..... what
are they????? 
Second- I believe this is a 1.7 engine... safe assumption (for the
time being). The engine has a single 2-barrel Weber on it. Is this OK
or am I looking at any potential problems/annoyances, because of this
setup? The carb seems to be missing a few pieces where might I find
them and how do I tell which Weber I have?  
 Thanks,   
    -Kent
BTW- If anyone one has info on the Busses by the Bridge gig, please
pass it along. I will be in my '70 Westy and it'll be for sale. Newly
rebuilt D/P engine 34pict3 dual vacuum dizzy, runs great. Brakes could
use some help. Canvas is shot. Otherwise in decent shape for being 30
years old and original.
