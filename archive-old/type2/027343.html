well I found used a 1979 auto trans. for my 1975 bus.  sounds like the guy 
wants $200 for it and it doesn't sound like it has the shifter part still.  
someone told me that i need the shifter because that is not interchangable, 
but in Bentley it says something about all shifters are the same for 
automatics in buses.  maybe i am wrong about that... If someone could clear 
this up for me that would be great.

I amconsidering buying it without the shifter and start the hunt for the 
shifter...or should I hold out for the whole package?  what do you think 
listees?
