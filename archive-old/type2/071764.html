A bad ground will also cause this, as it did on my '76.  Also, most older
buses have
tail light housings that are crumbling from old age. I got a replacement set
from The 
Bus Depot. Anyone know why E-Groups is showing the date as Saturday, March
13th? Did I come to work today by mistake? I thought it was Friday! Funny,
other people are here too! E-Groups Sucks!!       Jeff S., '76 Westy
