Subject: HULL sealant

Hi all!
This coming holiday weekend I will have time to install my floors and
paneling(insert wooohooooo! here) My one concern(well, main concern) is the
various holes in my floor. It seems that there are a dozen or so 1/2 inch to
inch size pre-drilled holes in diff places. I would assume for options and
middle seats and such. although after 26 years there has never been still
water resting in there or coming up through them(how this HASNT happened I
dont know) but after I put in my insulation and wood floors the last thing I
want is water rotting everything. with out welding, what can be done to
these holes? I was thinking a silicone sealant smeared across them?
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
thanks for reading this
steve
