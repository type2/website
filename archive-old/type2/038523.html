Subject: Re: Final EGR

Just a note about my experience with egr valve and parts.  When I bought my 
76 bay window bus,[in '88, in NC]  the egr tube from the exhaust had rusted 
thru, was broken off, and PO [or more likely some shop] had placed a solid 
gasket twixt flange and pipe, and stuffed epoxy putty in both ends of the 
rusted off tube.Local VW dealer told me parts were no longer available.  No 
Emissions inspection has EVER questioned me about this,[13 and counting]  or 
even looked at it as far as I can tell. When my FI finally bit the dust 
[mayhap to be resurrected someday, as I saved all the parts] I took the 
filter off, and again, no questions asked. All they seem to care about is gas 
cap,[vented or no] and converter-have got? or messed with? Co2 levels, and 
monoxide within spec?  and nothing else. Except getting their $10.00. 
As I understand it's intent, it was to recirculate A PART of the exhaust 
stream, to reduce emissions, but the consensus was, it wasn't much help, and 
it didn't work very well. And they rusted off frequently. Because the 
condensate that gathered in the filter dripped back down into the tube-and 
started to work as soon as the engine was shut off. I have yet to see a late 
bus with this system intact. In the parts of Florida where they require 
inspections,[ Tampa Bay area, where I live...] they don't even open the hood. 
And my bus is consistenly at the low end of the allowable limits for 
Monoxide, Dioxide,and  nitrous oxide. As long as I get a tune-up before 
inspection. 
In short, don't seem to need it, don't miss it, don't worry about it.
