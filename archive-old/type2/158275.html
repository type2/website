The good  ones also have thicker material in the forks.  Instead of a
little  divot on the front (FIF) side of the &quot;hook&quot; there is a hole with
material  ahead of it.  This stops the hooks from breaking off at the
&quot;divot&quot;  when they wear.

You're right about the welding, though.  If I pull  a throwout fork out and
it isn't completely welded I will weld it up.   However, if the hooks are
worn the fork is trash unless you can weld up the  fork a bit and reshape
the ends.




Hey Guys  The HD ones are welded all the way around, the stock ones  can't be 
done like that aas they don't go all the way around the shaft. I use  the 
super clips that have a loop in them that creates a spring action. I also  use 
wire tie to tie the clips to the crosshaft arms so that the clips can't fall  
off.  later  mark dearing
