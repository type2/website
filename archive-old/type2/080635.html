Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Fill Hose, Filler neckto tank 72-79 Bus HELP!

To Theo &amp; &quot;The List At Large&quot;

While I cannot offer immediate relief, don't despair, a high-quality 
reproduction of this item is to debut soon later in 2002.  I have been working 
with the &quot;volks&quot; in the biz on this as well as a few other &quot;Bus Goodies&quot; for 
both the Vintage and Bay Window &quot;volks&quot; to appear soon on the market.  Other 
than finding a good used one (such as from BustedBus_dot_com), I'd say to the rest 
to hang on until the new ones arrive.  68-71 as well as 72-79 hoses are just 
starting into the prototyping stage now.

Is Old Volks Home getting back into the parts game?  Not exactly, but I've been 
approached to re-activate my window rubber tooling to be marketed through a 
third-party - strictly in the &quot;thinking cap&quot; stage.  But ya never know.

I'll keep you posted :-)

&gt; Does anyone know where I can find this part?            The number is
&gt; 211-201-125D.
&gt; 
&gt;      Bus Boys lists it but NLA, I called my dealer in Annapolis and he
&gt; checked and also said NLA. Bus Depot sells the upper filler neck collar
&gt; (211-201-119) but that is not the one I need. Mine is badly dryrotted and
&gt; leaking gas when the tank is more than 1/2 full and going around turns or
&gt; on fill up. Please help as I want to go camping this weekend and was hoping
&gt; to take Possum for her maiden camping trip. Used is fine with me as long as
&gt; it is in good shape.
