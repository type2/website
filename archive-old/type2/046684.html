Subject: [T2] re: low oil pressure at low speeds

1500 H series engine in a bus.  Appears stock.

&lt;snip&gt;

My guess is the bad flooding &quot;cleaned&quot; the engine to the extent that
bearings are now loose enough to reduce oil pressure.

I'm wondering if a &quot;heavy duty&quot; oil pump might keep me from having to
tear down the engine.  It's not my daily driver -- I'd like to keep it
runnable for once or twice a week pleasure trips around town.

Any suggestions on further diagnostics or baling-wire solutions
appreciated!

can you beg borrow or steal an oil pressure gauge to compare actual psi
with? 
 using thicker oil makes more pressure.  HD oil relief spring?  Round
town 
local trips dot sound like heavy duty hauling long distances- ya the
motor 
might last quite a while.  at a couple local drives a week.  dunno.    

Joe, Clara:
I'm with Clara that an oil pressure gauge would be nice, but the ideal
&quot;baling wire&quot; fix is 20w-50 oil. I've even used 60-70 Harley oil in a
worn out American truck.
Years of driving motors with worn out lower ends has taught me this.
A piece of black tape over the oil light? Well, maybe not!
Actually, what has happened is not that the engine is cleaned out, but
rather that the main bearings are damaged from contact with the
crankshaft because of the poor barrier strength of the diluted oil.
Severe damage will also manifest itself in oil control problems both at
the flywheel seal and piston rings not being able to control the excess
flung onto the cylinder walls.
Normal clearances are about .0015 to .0025 and you've probably got
something like .005 to.007. The amount of oil flung off probably
increases as the square of the radial clearance, so one can see that the
problems get a LOT worse with wear.
Having said that, the 1500 or even 1600 single port engines are not
working that lower end very hard and I believe that if it's not leaking
from the flywheel seal, that with heavy oil the bottom  end will
probably outlast the top end. I'd bet you still have 25 psi at 3000 rpm,
and that's plenty with the light loading on that engine.
I'd also agree with George that an HD spring will be no help. All the
spring does is limit the pressure at which the valve bypasses, and this
is not the case at idle.
I'd also rather  see that the light is winking at me at every stop light 
than listen to it revving too fast (and burning a LOT of petrol) at
idle.
