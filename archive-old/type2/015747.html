&gt;   The engine did not do so well on the compression test. I got 100lbs
&gt;on all but #3. I added oil but it was the same, about 65lbs. So I need
&gt;to replace the valves at least on #3. I don't know what size the
&gt;valves are. I was told that the engine was a 2.0L but the case still
&gt;has the '73 numbers on the case and fan, matching. (CD? I think) The
&gt;heads on the other hand do not have the ports for the air injection
&gt;and do have a threaded hole for sensor (temp?). How do I find out what
&gt;the head size is and what size valves I need? I don't want to do a
&gt;complete rebuild at this time, just the valves on this side. Are there
&gt;head #'s that I could go by? 

If they do not have the air injection ports they are not 74 heads, and if
they have the threaded sensor holes that tells me they are 2-liter heads,
unless they were 1700 heads that had the holes tapped.  1700 heads had
39.5mm intake valves and 2-liter heads had somewhat smaller intake valves,
around 38mm.  One of the manuals should give you the exact sizes.

&gt;  Once the head is off I want to mesure the cylinders to determine the
&gt;accual size of the motor. What are the different sizes for 1.7L,1.8L,
&gt;and 2.0L?

90mm, 93mm, and 94mm respectively.
