Hi,

I am just fresh to this list and have searched the archives for 
information about the heater in the bus I am about to buy.

My wish is that it be safe as we live in the Sub Arctic and it will be 
cold most of the time.

If anyone has expertise on this subject and can offer advice so I do 
not have trouble, please feel free to email or respond. We look 
forward to picking up our bus 1750 KM to the south or something in 
two weeks.

My first plan is to have the fuel lines to the heater replaced by 
Polar Mobility in Calgary, without even thinking about it as I hear 
this is the most common failure mode.

Thanks and I am glad to be a member of this list and the Bus 
community.
