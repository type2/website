Subject: Re: [T2] Problems w/ Idle During Warmup

Hal,

Got preheater hose?&lt;grin&gt;

In my experience it helps a lot during the cold/hot transition.

You may wish to set your choke so that it stays engaged a little longer
before the bi-metallic spring inside gets warm and opens it fully.

I would adjust the choke in this manner until it worked right!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Maybe someone's experienced this and can offer some advice.  When I first
&gt; start the bus it runs fine -- idle is a little high and choke is activated.
&gt; Once the bus is fully warmed up it runs fine too -- idle at around 900rpm and
&gt; choke is open.  The problem is in between those two points.  Once I've driven
&gt; off down the road and for about the first 5 minutes (until the bus is fully
&gt; warmed up) the bus just won't idle unless I keep a foot on the gas.  Engine is
&gt; a 1600 DP, semi-stock (no flaps or tstat), timing is dead on and the carb is
&gt; tuned correctly (according to Hoover's field tuning a 34PICT sermon).  Also I
&gt; should mention that I've had this problem both with a 009 dizzy and the vac
&gt; dizzy I'm using right now.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
