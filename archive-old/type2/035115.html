Gentlepersons-
                       Anyone familiar with Lindsay Porter's &quot;VW Beetle and 
Transporter:
Guide to Purchase and DIY Restoration&quot;? Does it cover the Bus as well as his 
other
books cover their respective topics...911's, MGB's, etc. If so, then I'd 
recommend
its purchase, even if it requires a little translation...Checked your 
&quot;gudgeon pins&quot;
lately?
