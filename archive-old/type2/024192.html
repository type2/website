Subject: A Cable For Cableless Courtney In BC
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I finally dug through my spare parts stash and have located my spare cable 
for a type IV thermostat (bus content) and now it turns out that I've lost 
the address of Courtney.  Please if you or anyone on the list who knows 
Courtney's address please forward it to me so I can send her this cable.
