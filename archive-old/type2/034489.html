Subject: Vent window frames for a 1973 BUS

Hello,

I am looking to replace my rusted out Vent window frames for a 1973 BUS.
They are the frames for the vent on the sliding door window,  and opposite
side window.  Its ok if they do or do not still have the rubber. Also needed
is the metal fram that wraps around the glass.  If anyone can help me locate
these parts,  I would appreciate it.


Thanks for any leads,

Jake
