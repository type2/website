Subject: Re: micrometers

Having worked in machine shops for years, believe me, a dial caliper is good to 
0.001 inch. A mic is good to 0.0001 if it is marked with a veriner; 0.0005 
without.

&gt; &gt;        Probably not as accurate as a micrometer, but it's likely good

&gt; &gt;instrument, while a Caliper will likely have a slightly looser tolerance
&gt; &gt;(+/- .002-.005&quot; or more, depending on the qualitly of the manufacturer).

&gt; It's a dial caliper, accurate (it says) to within .001.
