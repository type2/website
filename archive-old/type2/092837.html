&gt;When I do heads, etc., I like to come up in a series starting at 50% which is

I agree.

&gt;So that rules out using the &quot;generic&quot; 20-150 ft/lb device
&gt;that most of us started our &quot;underhood career&quot; with.  Do y'all that use
&gt;the same &quot;come up in steps&quot; head sequence use the small inch/pound
&gt;wrenches i.e. Proto 6062 series?  or is there something else preferred for
&gt;this application?

I prefer my Craftsman non-clicking torque wrench for VW engine 
applications.  It's the old style that moves a needle when the bar flexes - 
can't remember the technical name for it.  It does something like 0-90 
lb/ft.  I am comfortable with the accuracy of the wrench and I have seen 
the click-type malfunction (even good quality ones).  I torque my cylinder 
heads in stages with this wrench and have never had a problem.  Call me 
old-fashioned, cheap or whatever - it works for me and I stay with what works.
