Subject: Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages

I agree, but the new webers (at least the ones we sell) are all Vac advance
compatible, as are Dellortos. And this doesn't explain why people use an 009
with a stock carb!

We are starting to modify Kadrons here for a vacuum port so the K-Dog
equipped guys can run a vacuum advance Mallory, SVDA, or any other vac
distributor.

&gt; I can't remember how old you are, but in the late 60's early 70's the 010
&gt; was the choice...009 because all the 010 were snapped up and gone.
&gt;
&gt; The reason for them was the proliferation of aftermarket carb kits(holley
&gt; and others) that had *no* provision for correct vacuum readings for a vac
&gt; advance dist.
&gt;
&gt; I ran holley bugspray's out the wazoo and you had to use a mech advance
&gt; dist because of the vacuum problem.  And yes, I still run Holley
&gt; occasionally and I *can* make them work right&lt;grin&gt;.....even with a 009.
&gt;
&gt; We have all learned a lot since those times and sometimes forget that what
&gt; we know now is the culmination of 30+ years of knowledge on vw's.
&gt;
&gt; That the 009 is *not* the answer for most people, but why we went there to
&gt; start with.
&gt;
&gt; Hope you all enjoyed that trip down memory lane!&lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; I want to add something that I find interesting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; we sell a modified distributor we term the SVDA, it has a 009
centrifugal
&gt; &gt; curve, with the addition of vacuum advance. The vac pots are used, and
&gt; &gt; occasionally develop a hole or leak, rendering the vacuum advance
&gt; &gt; inoperable. The timing specs for the 009 and our SVDA are identical.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's humorous the mail I get when one of the vacuum cans destructs like
&gt; &gt; this, comments like &quot;it runs like shite without that vacuum can&quot;, or
&gt; &gt; something similar. I send them a new can, and point out that with an
&gt; &gt; inoperable vacuum advance, they have a 009 advance curve.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, unless you have compared an SVDA to a 009, there is no basis for
&gt; &gt; &quot;comparison&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 009 is inexpensive, and available new. The 009 proponents will claim
&gt; &gt; it's superiority to vac advance distributors, why didn't VW supply them
on
&gt; &gt; their beetles and busses, especially since it was so much less $ ? VBG

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Did I mention that most [hush tim, I said most! :)] mechanics are
&gt; &gt; clueless
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about advance curves and how they relate to the combustion process?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps there is a reason that VW NEVER EVER EVER put a [currently
&gt; &gt; common]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;009 on a typ1, typ3, or typ4 engine?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The best value of an 009 is it only wastes $50 or so to get by until
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; find a better curved dizzy. This does not include the T-IV motor. It's
&gt; &gt; dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong and cannot in any way meet specs.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have verified curves on a number of 009's and have found in the
cases
&gt; &gt; &gt; where they were not worn they all hit within a degree or two of 25°
total
&gt; &gt; &gt; range. The 009 is shown by Bosch as a suitable replacement for some VW
&gt; &gt; &gt; engines, but not the T-IV in any case.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Standard procedure when first installing and running any new or used
dizzy
&gt; &gt; &gt; is verifying the curve with a tack and timing light. Plot the
advance/rpm
&gt; &gt; &gt; every 500 rpm up to total advance. Compare your curve with stock. If
you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are within the stock curve min-max area at all rpm's, you can use it
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; expect suitable function. If not, find a better fit ASAP.
