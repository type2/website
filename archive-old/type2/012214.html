I once set up a bus cruise control as follows;

Loop of metal attached to dash directly above the throttle pedal.
Small thin metal plate attached roughly horizontally to dash near the loop.
Long thin dowel (wooden stick) with small notches cut into it's top third.
Bottom end of dowel drilled and lightly attached (with nylon fishing line)
to throttle pedal.
Top end of dowel goes through and past the loop. 
With foot on throttle as per normal push dowel so that the notches are
engaged by metal plate.
Release foot pressure and the dowel is lightly held in position.
Any movement of throttle pedal at all lets the dowel drop out of contact
with the plate and is released to fall into the restraining loop.
Fine control of setting achieved by playing with the dowel top end by hand,
notch by notch.

Is this visualisable?
This worked very well for me. Wish my description was as successful!!
