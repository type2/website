&gt; During
&gt; daylight use, my voltage is a steady 13.8, but if I add any other
electrical
&gt; load, such as headlights, it drops down to 12.3v or lower. The alt. itself
is
&gt; of unknown age and dubious origin. y' all think its time to replace that
&gt; puppy, or what?

You need to know more about the output besides voltage. You need to load
test the alternator and get the amperage output. This is the true story
about the alt. It sounds like you have at least one diode bad. There are 9
diodes in the alt. 3 negative, 3 positive, and 3 isolation. The 3 isolation
diodes control regulator voltage. They should not be your problem.
The 3 neg and 3 pos ones are in pairs and control the rectifier bridge. This
is what converts ac to dc. [An alternator is actually a ac generator] Diodes
die by either going open or shorting. A good diode only flows current one
way. A shorted diode will allow current to flow both ways. An open diode
will not allow current flow either way. If one shorts, you loose 1/3 of your
output and you usually have a drain on the battery and it will go dead over
time. If one goes open....you loose 1/3 of your alt output. This, an open
diode, sounds like your problem. It sounds like you are drawing more amps
than you are producing.
