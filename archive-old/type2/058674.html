Subject: 74 Steering Box Adjustable?

Hi All,

Doin battle with my steering box.  A 74.  I have about a half turn of steering
wheel play.  Checked and it seems to be the box and not ball joints. Don't think
it is adjustable, but I am looking at over 200.00 for a rebuilt one and thought
I would check.  Anyone adjusted the play out of a 74 steering box?

Checked busted bus and Mr Erskine says he did on a 72, but I can't find an
adjustment nut as he describes. (Which &quot;side of the steering box&quot;?)

Thanks v-e-r-y much! (May your bus always steer straight, and your path be
true!) Dave.

You can tighten the steering box to take out any play, but first check all
the steering joints to see if they are worn. On the side of the steering box
is a screw with a locknut. Loosen the locknut and remove the drag link from
the steering box. Wiggle the drop arm with one hand while turning the screw
with the other until there is no play, then tighten the locknut.
