-Has anyone managed to fit rear seatbelts into a camper conversion

Hi Andy,  I've got a 79 Devon. It's got rear belts but these are just 2
point lap belts attached through the seat padding. The left hand belt uses
what I guess are the original mounting points but ignores the upper point
which would take the belt over your shoulder. The right hand belt (this is a
British camper and we have our cabinets lining the right hand of the van)
takes the normal central mounting point but the outer point is much closer
in to the other one - I only just noticed this. I guess you'd sit the
smallest child on the right.

I don't know how effective they would be in an accident, but there's a lot
of empty space in front of the back seats so there's less likelyhood of
banging your head on anything as you're thrown forward.
