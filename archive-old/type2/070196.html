Does anyone have any more info on this pernicious  bit of legislation? I 
don't live in California, but as a state that gives us Midwesterners a 
steady supply of rust-free old cars, I'm a bit concerned. And damn angry. I 
bet the new car dealers are behind this somewhere. (P.S. Don't legislators 
have anything better to do?)
