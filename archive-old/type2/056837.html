POR-15 will stop rust--if you get complete coverage inside and out.  I have
used fiberglass to do a lot of patching on cars that I was just intending to
drive and not restore to great condition.  I had a SEAT 600 in Spain that I
drove back and forth to the base.  Paid $200 for it but the rocker panels were
about gone and the body is the frame.  I cleaned the rust up and fiberglassed
those babies in well, used four layers of matte, and the car was still going
strong when I left.  I overhauled the engine once, drove it four years and
sold it for $300.  Fiberglass works, but kill the rust before you use it.
