Subject: [T2] still runnin on 3 longish sorry

First of all muchas gracias to all who responded to my previous messages 
regarding this problem. I'm really bummed because I was planning on 
driving down the coast from Seattle to San Diego in this bus this fall and 
I have all but given up. I can't really afford to do a complete rebuild at 
this time. At least not if it will cost more than 800 -900 smackers. I 
live in a small town in Wyoming and there is one mechanic who will work on 
air cooled VWs. He's a good enough guy but my X pissed him off last year 
and he has been slow getting around to me . Untill I get him here I'm on 
my own so Let me describe this to the best of my ability one more time.

I installed a 2L into my 75 westy three weeks a go. It ran fine around 
town but leaked oil out of the  rear of the engine. It was not timed 
perfectly ( static only) I took it on a 90 mile road trip and the oil 
light began flashing. I stopped let it cool down added some oil drove 
again and the light flashed  at a certain rpm and it was loosing power 
unable to pull hills. We towed it home I did a compression test it's over 
100 on all 4 at high altitude. I let it idle and pulled the plug wires one 
at a time to find no difference on #4 I checked it has spark. Someone 
mentioned a possible FI problem but this baby is carburated. Is it 
possible that no fuel is getting to that cylinder? How would I check that?
What else can I check. VW parts place wants 1500$ for a used engine (not 
even rebuilt) no thanks. Does anyone know where I could get this one 
rebuilt if that is what I need. I'm in Jackson WY anddon't mind a road 
trip within 500 miles. That narrows it down a little. 

THanks in advance the list is very helpful to compleat idiots like me!!
