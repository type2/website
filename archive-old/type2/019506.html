&gt; &gt;If your in the Utah area, my driveway (and more) is available.  I don't

&gt;
&gt; Me too.  I remember struggling with offering my driveway to a listee from WI
&gt; who needed a last minute place to go the to Auburn Hill show.  I finally
&gt; figured out I wasn't being as open as I wished I were and made the offer,
&gt; and when I met Isaiah at the show was confirmed that an open house is a good
&gt; thing.  I know full well not everyone can or should take that stand, but I'm
&gt; going to try it here anyway.  I don't ever want to read about another
&gt; Kristen, either.  Maybe we'll all read about one less.  I hope so.
&gt;
&gt; Hang together, I say.

Same here John, there are too many bad things happening to good people. Space is
always available (as long as you can handle trains) or my buddy down the road
has a nice pasture (watch out for the cow pies.)
