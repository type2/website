Subject: Pair of 2L heads and child hammock FS

Hello,

A local from the Aspen area is leaving and wants to sell some parts from
a '79 Deluxe Westy:

1. Pair of rebuilt heads by GEX (I know, I know), one has a helicoil repair
2. A never used child's cot with the sliding rails

The heads were never mounted after being rebuilt as the local mechanic wanted
to do better (and charge more, unfortunately).  She's hoping to get a least
$250 for everything, plus shipping.  Thought this might really help someone
out in a jam for square-ported hyd. heads.  Please contact me as I am going
to look at these parts carefully tomorrow.

HTH somebody,
Craig in CO
