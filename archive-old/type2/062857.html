Can't you guys lighten up a little on Jim; anybody a.k.a.ing as Vanbondo
obviously believes in the fine art of satire--he pulls your chains so deftly,
but do you have to be so serious???  O.k., maybe I am bias as a fellow
Phoenician (blame it on the high temps--it bakes our busses and our brains),
but sometimes the best retort is a hearty belly laugh, and that quality is
mandatory to bus ownership......haha!! you go Rusty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
