An LT is also a VW van. It was introduced in the late '70's and looked much
like an enlarged Vanagon. However it's a different beast altogether. It was
only recently replaced by the new LT which is styled more like the Eurovan
(but bigger again).

I think the 35 stands for the max load (3500 Kg), there were different
versions. I believe most of them are diesels (I 've never driven others).
They were marketed (manufactured?) along with MAN. The lion logo may well
have been the MAN logo. MAN is a manufacturer or heavy trucks and they sold
the LT as their 'light' truck line. I'm not sure what the exact link between
VW and MAN is. They may well be wholey owned by VW.

LT's were also (and are still being) converted to campers. So you can find a
LT based Westy. These are fairly big. Too big and too much truck-like to my
taste though.
