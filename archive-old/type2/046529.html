Subject: [T2] Weber Hippo Throttle Body

Greetings List,

Has anybody had any experience using the larger Weber throttle body on the
late fuel injected busses. Do they really help much?  Were there any
problems?  Does anybody know where I could find one?  I understand they do
not make them any longer, but I have seen used ones for sale in the past?
Does any other manufacturer make one?   

Thanks,
