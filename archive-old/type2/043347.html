Hi,
I just remembered what we did when we got our 75 bus a
few years ago.  The windshield had been broken (beer
bottle while it sat in a parking lot for a couple of
years when the PO wasn't driving it) and we were going
to use it for a trip of a few hundred miles and I
didn't have the time or experience to put in the spare
windshield from a donor van (I was spending my time
getting the engine back together after wating almost
three weeks for MOFOCO to send me some parts that they
said they sent weeks earlier, but that's another
story)

Anyway--I called the local auto glass folks (Auto
Glass Specialties) and asked if they would install my
windshield using my glass and my rubber, and they said
yes, so we set up a time.  Two guys came (at the
promised time), put in the windshield, and charged me
$20 or so.

That could be another option for anyone needing glass
installed but not wanting to do it themselves.
