Subject: VW daily driver

I've had aircooled vans as my daily drivers for thirty years.  I've managed to
stay ahead of them and never got to work late because my vehicle failed, never
got stuck out in timbuctu or anywhere else because my van let me down.
Reliable, easy to fix, inexpensive to maintain. (I learned early on never to go
anywhere whithout a good tool kit onboard)  Not comfortable to drive but
comfortable to sleep in. Etc.  
I've always tried to leave them in better condition than I found them as a
matter of principle.  Only one I failed to do that with was involved in a
wreck...(drunk in a parking lot).  Presently am working my rear end off to get
my old '69 good enough to sell.  Not cost effective, but after ten years of
faithful service, blood, sweat and tears, I want to give the old guy a fighting
chance to hang in there...John Jensen in Annapolis
