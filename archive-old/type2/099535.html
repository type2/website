Subject: Fwd: &lt;VV&gt; Skyrocketing Corvair Prices

Saw this on the Corvair list....

&lt;snip&gt;

Group,

With all the talk of Corvair prices rising I was not suprised to see this ad
in the local paper: &quot;VW Camper Van '73 fresh paint, Corvair engine and
transaxle, 4 sp. toilet, icebox, sink $70,000 . . .&quot;  I know what these are
worth without the Corvair parts, so the Corvair power must make the difference
in price.  Everyone be nice to Chris Mills, he is sitting on a goldmine. Glad
I bought my Corvair stuff early (althought it is mostly LM).

Wonder what a Corvair with a VW engine would be worth!!! &lt;grin&gt;
