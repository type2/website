Subject: [T2] PUH-LEEZE READ

I posted last night and not one person has responded to my questions. I
have three oil leaks, two of them I have solved and know how to fix. The
third one goes like this:  Type 4 engine, 1800cc . Take off the fan
shroud and on the left side of the engine, where the oil filter spin-on
adaptor attaches to the block, there are two *holes* (I don't know what
else to call them), each about the size of a dime. It looks like they
were filled with press-in inserts. See the Bently Manual, section 5, page
25 (fig. 9-1) and page 50 (figs. 15-9 and 15-10). Look at page 50 first,
the *holes* are in the bottom left hand corners of both pictures, and
looking at page 25 gives you a good idea where they are in reference to
the rest of the back of the engine. Oil is leaking (quite rapidly) out of
the uppermost hole. I don't know what this is, why it is leaking, and how
to fix it. Somebody, please help. 
I don't know if no one read my posting or no one can help. 
I have been thinking about calling in a welder to weld a nice bead over
the leaking joint, does anyone think this would work? What exactly is the
type 4 engine block made out of? Magnesium? Aluminum? ...?  If JB Weld
would seal up the leak, would it handle the range of temperatures on the
ouside of the block? By the way, the block is NOT cracked. 
My wife and son and I are about to head out on a month long trip in two
weeks and we can't go unless I fix this. Again, please help me if you
can. 
Thanks,
Joel
