Subject: Re: [T2]Cleaning the inside roof of a late model 79 camper
  poptop.

&gt; The inside of my poptop on my 79 camper is rather dirty and has a fuzzy
&gt; material on it how can I clean this without removinag all the fuzzy stuff.
&gt; What is a good cleaner for this. Its like the inside of a vanagon roof.
&gt;
&gt; Casey


I have used a product called Scrub Free, a bathroom cleaner, smells like
bleach. Just sprayed it on and the mould and dirt disappeared and has not
returned since, and that was 3 years ago.

Joey.
