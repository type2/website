Well I guess the question that I should have asked is why did the oil
pressure stayed static at about 25 (0 when turned off) and now all of the
sudden it varies depending on RPM?  It is a fresh rebuild 2.0  with 2K on it
and since it is getting cold I'm using 10W-40 oil.  When I searched the
archives and found the million and one answers as to where the psi should be
I found the average to be at about 25 psi so I felt comfortable that I had
good pressure.  Now as I understand it, this pressure is on the low side and
so I should be running anywhere from 25 psi - 35 psi.  Is this correct?
Again thanks for all the help.
