Subject: Disc brake pad brands

After getting new calipers, pads, etc for the front, I've had squeak 
problems which oddly, starts not immediately but after driving for a 
while. The pistons are not binding. I pulled the pads and they are ATE, 
with a lot of visible metal (brass?) in them.  BusDepot sells at least 3 
differet brands (Pagid, ceramic, some kind of metallic and &quot;original 
equip&quot;.  Anyone have experiece with Ate and what brand is best (I'd like 
to find pads with least metal in them- In the archives, Tim Stephensd 
mentions metal leads to rotor wear, squeaks and the original pada did 
not last so long but cause no such rotor wear/squeaks?
