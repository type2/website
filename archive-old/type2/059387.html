To give Kevin his due, here is the resolution to one customer complaint:

Looooooong ago, I put together a List toy buy; Kevin ordered two.
He failed to pay for them.
He at one point did offer to work on a tranny for me at a discount, but I
had to ship the thing to him. Lost touch.

When I saw the moving sale, I half-facetiously told him to send me
something to make it up to me... he said sure.
Backtracked a bit when I wanted a splitty repair manual ;)  pointed out
that if he had a dollar for every customer who ordered a part and didn't
pick it up etcetc - not quite the same, but I took his point.
So I told him to just send me some geegaws lying around and we'd call it even.

He did: sent me a kovap baywindow for the 70, and a brekina s/c for the 65.

I'm happy with that, and just thought folks might like to know that he
lived up to his word on this.
