Subject: 55 MPH

On the subject of needing to do 70mph to keep up with traffic, I 
recently took two trips from BC to Newfoundland. (21,000 mi total).  I 
had decided to let the 72 Westfakia (1800 standard, progressive weber, 
fully loaded down) keep to a reasonable 55 mph.  After two cross 
continent trips, East on Canada's highway 1 and back west on US I 90 
only 1 person had seemed upset with our speed (one finger salute).  Mind 
you most people passed us at least 3 times per day, one poor guy in a 
black jetta (sunroof) passed us 5 times on I 90 and the last time he 
waved in friendly amusement.  Upon returning home, I discovered some 
weeks later that my speedo was wrong, and I had been going somewhere 
just under 50 mph the whole time!  The only time I was nervous was going 
around the North end of New York city at 10 pm in a pouring rainstorm!  
People out there are really good to bus owners, we don't need to &quot;keep up&quot;!
