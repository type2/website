Subject: Oil strainer?

Should I be changing the oil strainer and gaskets with every oil/filter
change?  I've done so every time so far, but found nothing there of
concern.  Yes, I am aware of the wimpy torque spec and the need to
adhere to it.

Is this what Boston Bob is referring to when he says:

&quot;I also use silicone to seal up the oil drain plate. This plate, if
overtightened, will break off and turn your entire case to junk. In the
life of you're engine, you shouldn't ever have to touch this, and its
too risky to mess with it.&quot;

Thanks!

Teri
