Any UK listers familiar with &quot;coach paint&quot; ? I had an address for it from an 
older
copy of &quot;Practical Classics&quot; magazine, but can't seem to find it. The product 
is
intended to replicate the original finish on pre-war cars that weren't 
sprayed.
I'm not sure if it's available in the US, but would like to find out...
TIA
