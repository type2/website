You have to buy Mexican insurance at the border. It isn't very expensive.
Bear in mind that it's intended to cover damage you might do to the
property of Mexican nationals, not especially to cover any damage you
might have done to you. The latter is far more likely--Mexican drivers
and Mexican livestock are incorrigible--but not their problem. In the
case of your Bus, that doesn't matter too much, I guess. ;)

So I wrote:
In the summer of 1993, I bought collision insurance for my '79 Westy
from Baja/Mex Insurance in San Ysidro. My incorrigible friend drove
my van into one of those incorrigible cows, totalling van, killing cow, 
and scaring us all pretty well. Insurance paid me $3000 - $200 deductable.
They gave the  claim to an American representative who did a pretty 
efficient job. I thought the damage was insufficient to call it
totalled, but it's their country, and you don't have a lot of room
to negotiate in that situation. Basically the tow company, wrecking
yard, and insurance company ate my bus before the Federales could
start figuring out how to levy various &quot;fees.&quot; At the time, it felt kind
of like watching the wolves pick off a caribou with a broken leg on some
National Geographic special. 

In summer of 1994, the same company told me my '78 Westy was too old and they
wouldn't sell me damage insurance for my vehicle. Oh well...

There are at least two major insurance companies on the border. The other
one told me it doesn't deal in collision insurance, period. 

I would have to go to extraordinary means to get collision insurance for my 
Westy in this country for its actual replacement value, given that it's 
in really good shape. In Mexico, it seems that's just not going to 
happen. There may be ways to get Mexican auto insurance that I don't know
about, but that would take special knowledge and/or connections. Seems like
anything is possible down there if your friends are influential enough.

So Mexico presents something of a gamble's paradox: You definitely  want your
car to be absolutely reliable and mechanically sound, but there are very
real risks for your vehicle against which you cannot insure yourself and 
absolutely reliable vehicles are expensive to write off.

In any case, absolutely, definitely get Mexican liability insurance at the
border. It's your &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card if you are in an accident,
even if it's not your fault. I bought some through AAA once, but it cost more
than the border vendors.

And don't hit any cows. They are surprisingly solid and they come right 
through the windshield because they are considerably taller than your bumper.
Federales laughed and told me I owed no one anything for the cow because it
was the owner's responsibility to keep them off the road. I think that
opinion is definitely subject to on-the-spot interpretation however.

Hasta luego,
