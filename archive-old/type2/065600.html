Subject: Face Up Or Face Down?

Hello All,

I just passed on some bad? advice to Jonathan because I had put it in  
shiny surface (up) inside the engine compartment - - figured it got hotter  
in there so it need the extra protection- - I was probably wrong but  
maybe we can start a whole new thread on the thermal dynamic  
characteristics of engine seal rubber if we try hard!

Now Sami says but it in shiny surface down...

I would appreciate it if there are other opinions out there on this (and  
why) - - sorry about that Jonathan!

&gt;It's easy, real easy. The shiny side faces down, the foam up.
