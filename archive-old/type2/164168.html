Subject: Re: [T2] Break In Schedule on a Rebuild?

Pete, very good question! I am thinking the same question.
I am going to EveryBus in NC. I will be doing an engine
swap there. Also a 2.0 engine. I will be driving the Bus
from NC to PA, 430 miles. I'll let you know how it turns
out. I was told just to keep it under 55 and to not let
the RPMs stay at one speed for a long distance.

Any one out there that has done this before?(A long
distance drive after a rebuild)
