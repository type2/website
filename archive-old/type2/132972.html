Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell adjustment using dwell meter 

Bill,

I've been doing it this way since 1972...It *is* hard to describe, but the 
results are &quot;perfect&quot;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I've been adjusting my dwell the following way for longer than I can remember,

&gt; Again, it sounds harder to describe than it actually is. These are very small
&gt; twisting motions with each screwdriver. You want to loosen the hold down screw
&gt; with the left hand just enough to allow the points to be adjusted. If it is
&gt; loosened too much the points will wobble while you are trying to adjust them.
&gt; Once you get the feel of it, it takes just a few seconds to make the
&gt; adjustment. I think it is a much quicker and more accurate method than using a
&gt; feeler gauge.
