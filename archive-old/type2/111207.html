As in a timing light?  They are replaceable, sort of.  Strobe tubes are
components.  A couple of styles are available from Radio Shack, and far
more are available from Mouser Electronics.  I've never had to replace a
strobe tube, though, so I question whether the tube is really at fault.

My timing light is a Heathkit and came as a box of parts
with an assembly and troubleshooting manual.  Nice if it ever needs
repairs.  Unfortunately, Heathkit has gone the way of the passenger
pidgeon.
