&gt; Today I bought a WR1 Bosch starter relay kit for my bus...
&gt; ...So, if anyone can provide any definitive
&gt; guidance on the mounting process, I'd sure appreciate it.

Dear Neal,

Don't knock yourself trying to mount this thing underneath on or by the
strarter. That area is definitely hard to access and work in. Put it in
the engine compartment just on the other side of the engine compartment
wall, to the rear of the starter. You can route the wires through the big
grommet and hole that all the other starter wires are coming through from
aft.

I have a '78 Westy and my starter relay is mounted just inboard from the
battery, in the engine compartment, on a wide, flat place between the big
perimeter engine seal and the lip of the battery pan. Easy access from the
rear engine hatch. It's held down with one bolt through a hole (presumably
drilled by the p.o. or his agent). It is convenient to the battery and is
only about 18&quot; from the starter (on the other side of the engine
compartment wall). There are only 3 connections: battery positive
terminal, ignition switch (the one that used to go to the starter
directly) and to the starter (to the terminal where the ignition switch
used to go). I was unaware that it was grounded at all. If so, it must be
grounded through the mounting bold to the unibody. The connections are
made with pretty heavy (12 gauge?)  braided wire and crimp on connectors.

I think that someone who had done it before and knew what they were doing
probably could install this muthah in 20 minutes. But an inexperienced
person working in good faith to figure it out on their own from the
instructions and first principles could easily spend hours and hours.
Don't let it get you down. It's all part of the great VW bus learning
curve.

As others have recently pointed out, it's good to check all the
connections to the starter carefully when working on a balky starter
problem. And if everything else checks out OK and it's still a problem,
then suspect the starter itself.

Good luck,
