Subject: Re: [T2] Acceptable speeds

&gt; And by having  several cars if one is dead I
&gt; drive another. If you don't have tools, time, and $$ old cars are not the
&gt; thing to be driving.

Yes, I too have several cars... and one of them IS dead... that's why I
decided to ask questions about it.  All I want to do, is try to decrease my
chances of duplicating the failure. For those breezing through the thread,
slow down and read this:  I'm not asking for advice on an indestructible
setup...  I am aware that I have to deal with the consequences of my driving
style, so please no more &quot;well it wasn't meant to do that&quot;, &quot;buy something
more suited&quot; or &quot;reap what you sow&quot; advice. I have parents and grandparents
and I can call them anytime for that kind of crap.  I am asking for the type
of advice this group is known for...
With the known facts that I am going to drive it hard, I have 2 VW's and I
don't mind doing the work, what is a practical method for making my bus MORE
suitable for my driving style. I apologize for any frustration you read into
this, I am only trying to get helpful advice.

Bryan
