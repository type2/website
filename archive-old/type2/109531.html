&gt; My camper is a P22 and it has a stove and I think I have to conclude that
it
&gt; was put in by the previous owner.

Yep, the stock sink and stove was a one piece unit. Your's looks to have
been a non-deluxe model. Does it have the fridge or an ice box?

&gt; Has anyone else seen a stove like this?

That looks like a stove out of an earlier SO42 Westy or Dormo.
