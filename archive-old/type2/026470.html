&gt;Also, when I use my icebox,water always drains out the bottom 
&gt;of my bus. The same thing happens with the sink. Are there 
&gt;supposed to be plugs for this? If so, would anyone have any 
&gt;or know where I can get any? Thanks a lot!

I may be misunderstanding your question, but you WANT water to drain out the
bottom of you bus from the icebox and the sink.  

The sink should have a manual stopper so you can fill it up with water when
you want.  You should be able to get one the right size at any home-supply
store.  The icebox has a drain tube attached to the bottom of the ice tray
so as your ice melts, the run-off goes out the drain instead of onto the
floor.
