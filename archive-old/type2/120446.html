Subject: Reverse will not engage in 74 automatic bus. Any ideas?

Hello List,

I am having a problem with my 74 automatic bus. I
cannot get it to go into reverse. It has plenty of
fluid but still will not engage into reverse. The
reverse worked fine until I installed the rebuilt
engine. When the gear changer is moved to reverse, the
transmission sounds like it tries to go into reverse
but nothing happens? What gives? I have tried letting
the engine warm up and I have tried running the engine
through the gears. Any ideas? Is this transmission
shot? I am selling this bus to a local but it would be
nice to be able to back it up in the mean time. Oh,
this bus sat for 3-4 years without being driven for
any significant length. Before sitting, the
transmission worked fine and yes, the vacuum hose for
it is hooked up. THanks!

Regards,
David Kelly
