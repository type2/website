Hi David,
	I believe it's a 1.8L, but I'm not sure how to tell the
difference. Serial number or something?
	One catch is that I won't sell the flywheel or clutch, as I need
them for the EV.
	I do have all the fuel injection parts-- it was running last week.
I also have a lot of other 914 crap-- the gas tank, exhaust system,
blower. Know anyone who would trade for a transmission end piece? Mine has
one cracked mount.
	Can't say I've ever sold an engine before. Maybe $400?

Brandon.
