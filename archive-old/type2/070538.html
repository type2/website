&gt;  Now what?

Well you've got your work cut out...

Remove engine
Remove gearbox
with draw rear shift rod
clean rod and inside of tube of old grease (pull an oil socked rag through)
replace the 'shuttle cock shaped' bushings which support the rod in the tube.
replace rear shift rod and connect to front shift rod
replace gearbox and connect to shift rod
test gear changing
replace engine

If you've not removed engine and gearbox previously then allow a couple of 
days to do the above.

At the same time as doing the above it would also be worth replacing the 
bushing at the front of the front shift rod and using a new rear coupler.

Bushings probably available from Bus Depot, if not try www.justkampers_dot_com as 
they usually have them in stock.

Good luck
