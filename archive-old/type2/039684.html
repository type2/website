Subject: Time Capsuel

I had written this a few weeks ago but had problems with my server
sending mail, I hope it might give some others an idea!



As we near the completion of our 72 Westy weekender I came up with an
Idea
that I thought was neat and wanted to share it with the list.

When I was carpeting the seat stands I took the opportunity to leave a
little something for someone to find when this bus gets restored again
10 or 15 years from now, either by me or someone else.

I included a few pictures of how our cow bus looked when we got it, some

pictures of the bus after the paint job and interior restoration, and a
brief story of how we got the bus, what had been done up to that point,
and a hello from me and Debbie. I put it in some acid free paper and put

it in several sandwich bags and taped it to the inside wall of the
drivers seat stand.

I also wanted to leave a little note on the wood floor in the passengers

area before I covered it with carpet.

I also think that this could be a good way to prove it was your vehicle
if it ever got stolen and the thieves never found your time capsule.

Meredith
