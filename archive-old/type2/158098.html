Subject: Balance Pipe Elbows

List,

I had some issues with my bus stalling at red lights, backfiring and then the
brakes finally got hard to press. I quickly traced the problem to the balance
pipe elbow on the right carb of my 1973 Bus. It first cracked and then it fell
completely off the intake. I order some more from Bus Depot, but I had to get
the ones for 74. According to the bus boys website, the correct ones for the
73 are NLA.

The ones that cracked are ones from Bus Depot that I put on last fall. If I
remember correctly they were very tight when I put them on and it looks like
they just cracked over the winter. Here is a link to the one on bus depot
http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=021129637F.

Here is the info about the correct ones being NLA on bus-boys site
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/carb1.html. I am trying to get part E and F for a 73.

Anyone know the difference between the 73 and 74 and maybe a place I can get
the correct ones?

Thanks,
Corbett
