I don't think you ought to put it inside the bus at all.

1. Oil cooler, with fan, shrouded. They use these on compressors and
generators, it shouldn't be hard to find a junker. Replace fan motor with
12v. Mount in engine compartment.

2. Duct exhaust from oil cooler into heater boxes. Block off the forced air
currently coming from the engine fan out the sides of the shrouding. With
duct tape. Like my bus is now. Increases cooling capacity somewhat.

3. Wire flapper valves on heater boxes open. Now, in the front of the bus,
put in a flapper valve such that when it's closed the heat goes into the
bus through the stock ductwork. When the valve is open the heat is
exhausted under the bus. Work the valve with the stock dashboard controls.
In operation it's just like the inadequate stock system, but the air going
into the heater boxes is pre-heated and forced now by the oil cooler which
would increase the temp of the heated air substantially.

Do pressure relief as prudent, I don't know very much about that.

This is very cheap. It might also be appallingly stupid for all I know. ;)
