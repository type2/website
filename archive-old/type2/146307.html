Subject: Re: [T2] No Wiring Harness

You can use a harness from a 65 if you want. The main ideas are all the  same 
just some fancy things here and there. You need lights and power to the  
starter, coil and altenator. Easier said than done but, that's it. Start with  one 
thing at a time. Wire harnesses can get crazy if you try to do too many  
things at one time. Knowing how the components work will make the difference.  
Don't forget warning lights. Get a Bentley manual. Same idea as wiring a dune  
buggy.
