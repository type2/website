&gt; &lt;&lt; Tony, do you know of a company that does stainless exhaust for upright
&gt; 
&gt; engines?  Were the cracks you referred to on VW systems?
&gt; 
This should be in the discussion from a few months back.
VW Heritage in the UK. About 160.00 and anothe 50 or so for shipping to
usa. They had an ad in VW Camp and Comm I think. They have a website.
I had asked if one of the list-wise vendors would try to deal but havent
heard anything about it for a while.
