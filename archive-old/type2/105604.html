I wish I had those kind of accidents.

&gt; 1) how difficult is it to repair tear/rot damage in the
&gt; canvas? (like many too poor to replace..)

It's just fabric but if it's ripped at the sides from rot like most canvases
I see the rest of it is probably weak also. Be careful washing it. Make any
patches larger than needed because when you strengthen one place another
becomes weak.

&gt; 2) what is the electric fan blower in top of engine
&gt; compartment? (remember engine was removed prior to my
&gt; acceptance of the van)it's not apparetly connected to
&gt; anything right now, but is a vw/audi part...

Blows warm air through the heater channel under the bus into the cabin when
you pull the right red lever.

&gt; 3)It had the hinged table, bit all hardware was removed for
&gt; replacement and lost? is it available? I have the wood, and
&gt; mount, but no hinges or the other parts

I have not seen the 74-79 leg for sale on it's own. Junkyard or try
BustedBus_dot_com.

&gt; 4) are there covers over the storage compartments in hte
&gt; fender wells under the seats?

Yes. See the first two items:

ory_Code=bp-i-u-floormats

&gt; 5)anyone have a correct owners manual to spare for a decent
&gt; price? can't find on ebay (have a vanagon one to trade?
&gt; ;-)

Start here:

Buy here:

Also try theSamba_dot_com for a used one.

&gt; 6)what is suggested to rejuvinate the fiberglass top?
&gt; should it be re-gel-coated? it's kinda getting fuzzy

Some people have done that with success. Other methods are documented in the
archives:

&gt; 7)what sort of fuel economy should I expect?(anything will
&gt; be better than the 10 mpg i get in my Land-Rover)

Ideally you will get 18-22mpg, expect less until you completely comb over
the engine.

&gt; 8)any tricks/tips for the aux battery? it apparently had
&gt; one before, cables/wires taped off with elect tape, but
&gt; does it come with an isolator or is it just a second set of
&gt; wires from alternator?

There is just a relay in the corner by the driver's rear taillight. The
wiring diagram is here, note the use of the fuse:
