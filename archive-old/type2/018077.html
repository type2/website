Subject: Yet another 009 Distributor question
Message-ID: &lt;3743947A.41540FB8_at_mindspring_dot_com&gt;

Hello,
About three weeks ago I posted with the topic &quot;the expensive sound that
wasn't&quot;, I decided for various reasons including that I am moving 2500
miles in 5 days from Atlanta to Carmel California to have a mechanic do
my auto tran service work, along with replace my exhaust system.  It is
funny I feel guilty now when I don't do my own work.  I had them also
set points and timing as well.

He found that my stock '77 vacuum advanced dizzy was not advancing more
than 5, I had them replace it.  I thought I was clear that I wanted to
have it replaced with the same, but I found when I went to check/set my
valve gap this morning that they had replaced with 009.

I researched the type2 archives and found allot of recommendations
against the 009 in a 2000 FI engine.  Though I did not find much in the
way of reasons why.

Any input on whether I should have them put a stock vacuum advanced
(like the one that was there) or keep the 009 and why, would be very
much appreciated, as I will not have the opportunity in a few days to go
back to them if I find it problematic.
Thanks,
A very tired Scoob
'77 Westy &quot;Cassidy&quot;
