Subject: Throttle Shaft Rebuild (Kit)

Someone posted a couple months ago about a source for throttle-shaft 
rebuild kits, and I've misplaced the message with the URL.  Does anyone 
have a source for these or remember the URL?

Also, Doktor Tim posted about carb re-bushing way back in 2000 (ref: 
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/044596.html) mentioning the need to 
measure the shaft to determine rebuild potential.  Are the tolerances for 
this in Bentley and if not, where would I find them?  I have a box full of 
Solex carb cores, so I'm confident I can find a good shaft in there 
somewhere, but it'd be a lot easier if I had a spec to measure for...

thanks,
	Tom
