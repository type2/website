Subject: RE: Weatherstrip problems

&gt; Can anyone recommend the best source for weatherstrip/seal for the 
&gt; rear door.  on my 70 bus. I've had problems with poorly fitting  
&gt; weatherstrip in the past.
  
&gt; I have tried the cheapo seal from Bus Depot but it was horrible.He no
&gt; longer shows the cheapo seal I bought. His looks just like the one
from
&gt; ISP West. http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211829193C 
&gt; Not sure what Bus Depot means by 1950 to 1971....... I think Ron meant

&gt; to say 1964 to 1971. 


The cheapo seal I had some time ago (for about $30) was just that - a
low-end Mexican made seal. At the time I offered it as an option because
the genuine one (which I also offered) was $100. Many people just
couldn't afford a $100 seal, so the cheapo one presented an alternative
to no seal at all (or something so badly rotted that it might as well be
no seal). As Karl correctly notes, it did not have properly formed
corners, which was its weak point.

The original seal has since gotten much cheaper. I have the same
previously-$100 seal for $59, at the below link. At this price, it's
worth paying the difference versus the cheapo one even if money is
tight, so I no longer carry the cheapo one.

The $59 one is an OEM Volkswagen seal. I am sure it's the same one ISP
West is charging just a little more money for.  They list it as NOS
German. Assuming it's the same seal (and I'd lay money on that), I do
have some issues with that claim. First of all, NOS means &quot;new old
stock,&quot; which is not the case with these seals. They are still being
made by the supplier to VW, so while they are OEM (original equipment)
they are not technically NOS.  This is probably a good thing, not a bad
thing, as 30 year old rubber can get old and brittle even if never
installed. Secondly, I am hesitant to refer to it as &quot;German.&quot;  This is
a common claim regarding this particular part (and some others), as
several wholesalers and importers selling this seal also make this claim
(which is probably where ISP got their information). But as a direct
importer myself, I have seen direct evidence to the contrary. I have
seen the IDENTICAL seal (and I mean identical) labeled both as
VW/Germany and VW/Brazil. Even among those that I imported from Germany,
some have had Brazil labels on them and some German labels, and the
seals were identical. Therefore I have severe doubts as to whether the
seal is actually German made, despite the labeling. Just as VW of
America sells many parts that they obtain from VW of Mexico or VW of
Brazil, so does VW/Germany. Just because the seal was imported from
VW/Germany does not mean that it's actually German made. Country of
Origin labeling laws tend to be more lax overseas, and even more so when
they are labeled for export. Not that this means that they are any
different, or worse. Rubber trees don't grow in Germany anyway, so no
&quot;German&quot; made rubber product is really entirely German made. And these
fit correctly. I am only explaining why I am a bit more cautious on my
labeling (&quot;genuine VW&quot; rather than words like &quot;German&quot; or &quot;NOS&quot;) on
these as well as other parts I sell. That said. they fit correctly, and
they're only $59. This is the seal to buy.

As for my site specifying '50-71 rather than '64-71, guilty as charged.
This was an typo on the website (now fixed).
