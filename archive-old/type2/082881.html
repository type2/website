Subject: carb synch idea

Hey volks, I have been kicking this idea around i my 
head for a while and wanted to see what the resident 
wizards have to say.
As those on the list that are into motorcycles(such as 
myself) know, most multi-cylinder bikes have individual 
carbs for each cylinder. This entails occasional 
synchronization(maybe one of these days I'll actually do 
it to mine). The most common carb synch tool is a 
plastic case with mercury filled tubes. There are hoses 
coming out of the case that attach to nipples on the 
intake manifolds. 
The upscale synch tool uses 4 vaccum gauges (wich look 
almost identical to the vaccum/pressure gauge I have in 
my tool collection) mounted on a board or in a box.
So here's the question(in case you hadn't guessed): 
couldn't I get another vacccum guage(or buy the 4 guage 
bike one), and have a guage plumbed to each of the 
venturi ports (the ones you'd use to run a vac adv 
dizzy) on my Dellorto FRD's?(L and R are identical). It 
seems that a reading on a vac gauge would be more 
accurate than a uni-sym with its little floating red 
bead. Might be a bit more convnient to have simaltaneous 
readings rather than going back and forth. I'd have to 
disconnect the advance for the dizzy(when i get around 
to ditching the Dreaded 009) but that shouldn't affect 
carb balance at idle, should it?
I will very likely be trying to do this(will of course 
report to list if and when). I have been riding for over 
10 years and really should own a carb synch tool and 
have little desire to futz with mercury. At the very 
least I can fit a second vac guage into my budget and 
tool collection.
So am I on to something or just on something or need to 
be on something. :-)
