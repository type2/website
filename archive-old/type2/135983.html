Subject: fire damage questions

hi,
my 1975 riviera camper had an engine fire last saturday.  i found out that one fire extinguisher was not enough to put the fire out.  fortunately, someone brought another fire extinguisher.  unfortunately, this took awhile.
everything in the engine compartment is nice and crispy.
lots of damage to the paint on the back end as well.
my major concern is the Fuel Injection system.  i'm concerned that the control unit might be fried.  any guides on how to test this unit?
is the CIS upgrade kit still available from anywhere?
 
cheers,
will
