Subject: RE: Canada, eh?

On that same note, if you happen to be an avid photographer, pro or
amateur, don't flaunt it when going North. US Pro photographers are not 
allowed to shoot in Canada and need to leave their gear at the border (or 
customs at airports); all photo shoots can only be done by Canadian 
photographrers. That's what happened to a friend of mine on assignment
and trying to lug his stuff across the border.

PS. I imagine the same applies to wood workers.


&gt;To Shawn's excellent remarks I would add -- 
&gt;
&gt;Don't try to carry firewood or other wood products into Canada.  It will be 
&gt;confiscated at the border, and if they're having a bad day it can trigger 
&gt;additional unpleasantness.
