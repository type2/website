Subject: [T2] Towing a Westy

I'll be bringing my &quot;new&quot; '77 Westy home Saturday, and since the front beam 
has serious rust it will have to be towed. Commercial tow is going to run 
nearly $200.00 (flatbed truck, 58 miles), so I am debating whether or not to 
rent a U-Haul tow dolly ($40.00) and use my Chevy van to tow it home. Tow 
with front wheels off the ground or rear? I went to Sean Bartnik's site and 
looked at the copy of the '78 owners manual for towing instructions, and it 
shows MPH and distance limitation only for automatics. I thought this applied 
to manual transmissions as well, but it doesn't say that.Of course there is 
no limitation if the rear wheels are off the ground or the axles are 
disconnected, but I don't want to fool with disconnecting the axles, and this 
beam is so rusted I don't know if I want the front wheels on the ground.  I 
can stick to back roads to keep speed down, but distance is still the same. 
Any thoughts/experience?   Thanks, Jeff S.
