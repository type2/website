+AD4-Hi volks,
+AD4-     Here's a small thing of note...
+AD4-
+AD4- Some of you may recall that I changed my wheels recently from stock
+AD4-14x5.5 to 15x7, fitting brand new tyres (195/70R15C) in the process.
+AD4- I keep a note of my fuel usage and noticed a significant drop in
+AD4-mpg with this change. Sure enough, when I measure the radius change
+AD4-and do the numbers I get a calculated drop of 0.6 mpg which offsets
+AD4-my measured change of 0.75mpg.
+AD4-
+AD4- This raises a couple of points of (minor) interest:
+AD4-
+AD4- (1) I am getting 0.15 mpg less as a result of my fatter tyres. I
+AD4-suspect that this is attributable to higher actual speed, since I
+AD4-still look for the same indication on the speedo (and the bus is
+AD4-much more comfortable at higher roadspeeds).
+AD4-
+AD4- (2) A similar change in rolling radius would account for a wide
+AD4-variation in reported mpg. A listee running passenger tyres or
+AD4-some other slightly undersized rubber would perceive significantly
+AD4-higher mpg when comparing petrol pump to odometer readings.
+AD4-
+AD4- My actual change has been from 20.5mpg average over the past 15000
+AD4-miles to 19.75mpg over the last three tankfuls (670 miles). Three
+AD4-tankfuls is a small sample- we'll see what happens in time.
+AD4-
+AD4- NB All measurements are imperial: 20.5mp(i)g -+AD4- 17 mp(us)g
+AD4-
+AD4-Cheers,
+AD4- W.
+AD4-
+AD4-PS  Those of you who think this is a trivial detail should recall
+AD4-   that I'm in the UK, and hence paying the equivalent of +ACQ-5/gal
+AD4-   for fuel.. :-(
+AD4-
+AD4-

I did a quite lengthy measurement of my mpg about 3 years ago, over about
5000 miles. I found that results for individual tankfuls was quite variable,
but the long term smoothed average gradually got closer and closer to a
consistent figure - about 21.5 mpg imperial. A variation of only 0.15 mpg I
would think is fairly insignificant, but time will tell.

I presume you have accounted not only for a variation on the indicated
speed, but also the distance, as the mileometer will also be out if the tyre
circumference has altered. I checked mine against motorway markers for 30
miles, and was surprised how accurate my recorded miles were, but I do have
stock wheels and tyres.
