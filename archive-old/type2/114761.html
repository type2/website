Steve,

What Permatex product are you talking about??

Permatex silicone, or #2, # 3, #4, or what?

There are a bunch of Permatex engine building adhesives out there--#3
will  stick to anything--

i had a chit chat with a rebuilder in eugene, a feller who claims
thousands of rebuilds under his smock. he gave me some gentle advice
about permatex and i wanted to share it with the list for thought. he
sez the permatex on an oil pump can become a problem; that it doesn't
stick to paper - pretty much all else except paper. if one were to put
it between the case and the gasket i run risk of that blue stuff in my
block. i have some curilK2 and i'll probably go with that, but how many
engines, if any at all, lost pressure due to this kind of possibility??
