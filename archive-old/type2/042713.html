David Schwarze replies to MotorHole_at_aol_dot_com:

&gt;&gt; Questions: I've got a disabled Main idling electromagnetic cut-off jet. Do I
&gt;&gt; need a functioning one and if not, must I keep a wire attached to it?
&gt; 
&gt; You need to either have a functioning one or plug the hole.  As an
&gt; alternative, you might also try what I did which was to stack a couple of
&gt; washers over the threads so that it doesn't screw in far enough to shut off
&gt; the airflow even when the electricity is not hooked up.  In this case of
&gt; course you don't need to keep the wire attached.

What I did when faced with a similar situation is to cut the plunger off
with a pair of aviation snips. The heck with washers.
