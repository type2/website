Subject: Re: Engine (Paint)Assembly Procedures

Got no replies to my pushrod tube query. Never saw it and assume my own
e-mail does not come back to me via the type2 subscription - I am new to
subscription and this is my only subscription !
Back to the point - I too am having an engine rebuilt to slot in my 73
Westfalia (yummy - a 2.0 - and would like to know from the spit and polish
brigade if there is any particular paint suitable to enhance the 'rear end'
of the bus ! I have seen 2 similar previous requests but no response.
