Unleaded...  Assuming you live in the US.  But I assume you're in Canada from
you email address.  In the states, the nozzles for leaded and unleaded are
different.  The fuel filler neck keeps idiots from putting the slightly larger
leaded nozlle, and thus leaded gasoline, in their unleaded gas tanks and
destroying their catalytic converters...  But a 77 wouldn't have a catalytic
converter anyway, so I don't know why there would be a difference.  Now I'm
confused...

PS.  pmail me if you need instructions on installing your fuel filler neck w/o
cutting a hole or dropping the engine...

&gt; am assuming it should be unleaded.
