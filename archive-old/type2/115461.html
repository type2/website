Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

Maybe you haven't been keeping up with the Joneses today Doc.  The topic of 
ten dollar points arose in an earlier post.  I don't know about the rest of 
you, but my VW's have always 'eaten' points, and munched on caps, and had 
rotors for dessert.  I've gone through two, yes, count 'em - two caps and 
rotors since I changed to the CDI 8 1/2 years ago.  No more carbon tracking, 
no more faulty condensers.  How many years does something have to work 
before it becomes 'reliable' in your esteemed opinion?  Based on that 
principle, perhaps I shouldn't use a cellphone, because the pulse-rotary is 
more reliable.  Maybe I should use a typewriter and the Postal Service to 
send messages to the list, cause my computer might crash, preventing this 
message from reaching you all.  Maybe we shouldn't drive any cars built 
after 1974, cause they don't have Kettering ignition systems, and they might 
leave you stranded on the road somewhere.  Oh yeah, I carry a cellphone.  I 
don't need to worry about that anymore.  Making a feeble attempt to ridicule 
me for choosing what has become reliable technology over an obvious 
engineering 'crutch' that barely manages to initiate combustion, is amusing 
at best.  There is a concept known as 'progress', and although certainly not 
perfect in practice, there are enough technological advancements out there 
worth investigating that warrant 'upgrading' the weaker aspects of our 
classic vehicles, IMHO.
