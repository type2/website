Someone commented - don't use cheap oil 
Well up until recently I had an 84 Toyota Tercel, which because I was in a
rush,
I took it to an oil change place to have the trained professionals the -
&quot;Top Drips&quot; do it.
They put in their 'house blend' oil rather than the brand I usually use.

Well I noticed on leaving the place that the oil light was flickering at
idle, and sometimes
was even solid on at idle when the engine was hot. This was new. I'd never
seen the oil light
when the engine was running before.
I drove it for a while, heel and toeing it to keep it above idle when
stopping/stopped, 
but got fed up, and changed the oil to my normal brand name.
Problem went away never to return. So Don't use cheap oil.
