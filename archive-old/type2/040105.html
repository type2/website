Subject: EGR

I'm putting on a new exhaust system that has a place for the EGR to hookup. 
It turns out the PO just sawed up the EGR filter and I guess it's been 
sucking air from under the bus. What kind of effect would this have?

I'm wondering, do I cap the EGR both the egr to the engine and the exhaust 
or buy a replacement? Replacements don't seem cheap, actually I've not seen 
one for my 77 bus.
