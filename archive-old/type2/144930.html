OK, &quot;Is that your face, or did your neck throw up!!!&quot; 
You didn't say the insults or snide remarks had to be
related to your question ;^) Peace Brother!

But to give you an answer, the ONLY time I removed a
bell housing from a tranny I found that there were
nuts (maybe 5 or 6??)on the inside of the bellhousing
(under all the clutch throw-out stuff) which connected
to studs in the tranny boxwhich you had to remove then
a few whacks with the rubber mallet separated the two.
It was a late bay tranny, but I assume they are mostly
the same???
