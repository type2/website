Subject: Re: [T2] High performance brake upgrades for bay window buses?

&gt;His company sells a Porsche 944 kit that works with 68-70 bus front stub
&gt;axles, which will fit the later buses.  Note: he is located in England.

Marcus,

See if you can talk this guy into a &quot;group buy&quot; rate.  I'm interested.  
we can also split the cost of shipping.

Maybe we can purchase the conversion parts while sourcing 944 calipers 
stateside. . . ?
(BTW I'm interested in P 5x130 bolt pattern not wide5)
I also have a spare set of 911 M calipers and rotors so that would work too.
