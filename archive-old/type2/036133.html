Subject: Re: data display

	Mark,
	$279 for an LCD!!?!?!? HA! Try people like Allied Electronics and 
Electronic Parts and Components, Wholesale (or Retail/Surplus) in the 
phone book.

	Get a $5 yard sale radio with an LCD and open it up and try
to hot-rod it. What you'll find inside is an LCD with some workable
but probably fragile interconnect to the circuit board. Connected to that
will be a display driver, since LCDs need AC (not DC) to become
transparent. With LUCK the display driver will take data frames from
another chip which supplies time, station #, etc. 
	With a LOT of luck it would be 28 wires, one for each of the
seven segments of each of the four digits:
  1
  _
7| |2
  - 3
6| |4
 5-

Power the thing up and one-at-a-time ground each of the pins on the IC 
driving the LCD with a 5..25 Ohm resistor. Ground the inputs to the LCD
too and see what happens :)

	Besides the tinker's delight of 28 signals, you might find
7 signals for the segments and two to select digit 0-1-2-3 (two
binary digits will do this- how much digital electronics you know I'm
not sure, its pretty straightforward) and a write clock (total 10)
or you might find four signals for numbers 0-9 and two select or you
might find one serial data line and clock line with who knows what
format. Oscilloscope territory. Not that you can't twist it to your
own ends, but its more work, since you'll have to duplicate the
data format with the kludge circuit you build.

	Worst of course is the cheapest possible radio, with one IC
that does everything including drive the LCD. They you'll have to 
supply LCD drive in your kludge circuit since you can't get INTO
the one-and-only IC to put in your data.

	In any event, the radio won't have an ADC or a mux to select inputs
so you'll need to supply same. Most people with a little money to solve
problems like this use a lap-top and a 'data aquisition card' and display
10 or 45 parameters on the computer screen- Burt Rutan uses a Mac Powerbook
(an outside the box kinda guy if there ever was one) for most of the
instruments on that neat asymetric twin he built recently...

	Shoot, for $279 I could build a nice display around a VERY high quality
3.5 digit multi-meter and a rotary select switch, fly out to wherever
you live to install it for you and buy us both pizza for dinner!

	If you start by runing the wires and having a selector switch,
you can put a electromagnetic pannel meter on it now, a cheap LCD (VOM) 
next and hot-rod the radio after the rest of the system works. Incremental 
with visible success at many points along the way is my recipe for success, 
though others prosper other ways.

	Keep at it, and remember, cheaper is better!

	Cheers!
	Bill
