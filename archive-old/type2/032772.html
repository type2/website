howdy jack,

there should only be two sets of two springs, one set for the throttle
returns with the hooks, and the other smaller set without hooks are the
cross-bar self-centering springs that go between the bracket bushing and the

end of the cross-bar.

but hey, a picture is worth...

let me know if you'd like the complete install instructions. i can scan them

in and upload the whole mess.

cheers,
victor

&gt; Help,
&gt;
&gt; I have a pair of Weber 34-ICT carbs for my 1800.  I am looking for more
&gt; information on these carbs so that I can reinstall them.  (I have
&gt; recently rebuilt my engine, and the carbs have been off for over 6
&gt; months.)
&gt;
&gt; Specifically, there are a pair of springs which have me mystified.  I
&gt; have no idea where they go, though I am sure that they belong on the
&gt; carbs.  They have no hooks on the end, so I am assuming that they go
&gt; inside of something. They are about 3/4 to 1 inch long and 1/4 inch in
&gt; diamteter.
&gt;
&gt; I did not rebuild the carbs, so I am sure that the springs had to be
&gt; removed in order to remove carbs from the engine.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt;
