Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Westy Camper prices - again


I think there's been a definite change in folks' attitudes toward baywindow buses in general.  

I've lately been perusing ads on The Samba for early bay rigs, including campers, and the asking prices are often 2 or 3 times higher than I'd expect based on long term experience.  Even rigs with major body damage &amp; rust, and/or needing expensive repairs are listed with prices of $3,000 and up.

Local newspaper ads for baywindows have also jumped way up in prices asked.  Buses &amp; campers that a couple of months ago were offered at $1,500 to $2,000 are now listed for $3,000 and higher [often _much_ higher].  On the other hand, most local ads for splitties and Vanagons are asking prices lower now than one would expect based on experience over the last couple of years.

Curioser &amp; curioser - is this perhaps some sort of 9-11 thing?
