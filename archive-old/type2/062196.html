Hiya bus owners!

For some strange reason I've decided that a VW Camper (Westy?) is
something that I would just love to have.  I was wondering if you folks
could could point me in the direction of some good information (either
electronic or paper) for a potential owner.

I've been lurking here and on the vanagon list for a while and have just
about decided that I can't live without one.  I've particularly enjoyed
the Inuvik stories.  Also, if anyone knows of any organizations local to
me here in Dallas that I could get in contact with, I would appreciate
the information.

I'm primarily interested in the early air cooled models for their
simplicity as I would be doing most of the work on it myself (former
auto mechanic am I).

I appreciate any advice or recommendations you can offer!

Thanks!
