Subject: 73 bus update, shift probs

  Many of you know who &quot;Pim&quot; is and he has a problem I haven't dealt 
with yet, so I thought I'd send to you &quot;wizards&quot;.
- - - - - - - -

&gt;  We haven't heard from you and Arjin in a while Pim, how are you
&gt; doing on the van.

Well Arjen and I haven't had much time or money lately (student-blues), but
I've just finished a week of tests at school (Arjen has one extra week
comming up) and monday (the 4th) is my birthday (21) some there should be
some extra cash in my pocket.

anyway, I had got some free time just now and it was not raining (was
prodicted) so I went to work on the bus.
I pulled the shift-stick apart. there are some worng parts. Yesterday I
bought this diagram book. so i can locate the worng parts, call my &quot;local&quot;
(15/20 miles away) shop tell the the page# and the part# and he can order it
for me (most of his stock is bug).
The bottom of the stick has a round end. through this end/ball is a pin. I
can pull it out on one side, there is space to move it around a bit. should
this be replaced ?
the book has 2 types of stick-to-rod connections. I've got the one with the
bushing that goes into the the end of the rod.
(not the one where the rod sits in the bushing). there is a small pin on the
pan that goes into the bushing.
this bushing is also worng (WCM part# 211-197)
2 feet to the back there is a rubber bushing that connects the 2 parts of
the shift-rod. i'll have to get the 8mm quare-head bolt of to replace the
shiftrod-bushing. have to get a tool for that as it's pritty stuck.
about the shift coupler (the U-shaped thing near the tranny, WCM#131-100).
it look's ok (old, but ok) and there is no play on it. should i replace it
anyway ? do the parts (coupler, rubber-blocks, bolts and nuts) come in a kit
or do you have to use the old bolt ? (looks pritty strage to me)

&gt; Got the purple fake fur in yet?  :-)

about the interior. our friends up north have stripped a crewcab and they
got the rear bench (with the box that it rests on) put aside for us. well
have to pick it up in the next few weeks. this way we have a almost original
kombi. it has no legs, it just sits on a box. this box will be used for
speakers :-)
the purple fur is more custom trick for our friends south of the border
(belgians not mexican's).

I got my hands on a streetrod catalog the other day. it had lots of wheels
from american racing, including empi 5's that will bolt straight on to the
70's bus !! does anyone know who carries the american racing wheels ?

Keep on buggin' &amp; bussin',
