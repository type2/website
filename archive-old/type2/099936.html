Subject: Alternator light on

My alternator light stayed on after I started my bus this morning.  When I revved the engine in neutral it went out right away.  What does this mean? Should I check the fluid level in the battery?

I think my alternator belt needs more adjustment or replacing: I noticed it had stretched quite a bit when I stopped in Palm springs 3 weeks ago on my trip and noticed how hot the engine was.
