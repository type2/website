Subject: Looking for a Camper...

	Well I was talking to my friend Michelle in New Mexico and she
wants to buy a fully restored and reliable camper VW  with the tent on
top....She likes to take long road trips and a camper would be good for
her....Im new to the VW realm myself and I think the Westy is what she
wants?....She wants a 70 or later model?....She has up to 10,000 to spend
on it so were looking for a fully restored one....Not some hunk with rust
all over it....

Thanks for yer time and email me if ya  know of a beauty for sale...

Greg
