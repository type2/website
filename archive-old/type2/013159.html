&gt; Hey all,
&gt; Let me say one thing more about, metal preparation, sealing, priming,
&gt; and refinishing any vehicle.
&gt;

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I have been using Metal prep from Dupont, to remove any oxidation, rust,
&gt; contaminants, with excellent results.
&gt;
&gt; I have been using Vari-Prime to etch into the metal, and seal old
&gt; unknown prior top coats, with excellent results.
&gt;
&gt; I have been using Ultra Fill, by Sherwin Williams, to fill any
&gt; imperfections, with minimum shrinkage,and zero paint bleed through.
&gt;
&gt; I have used Dupont's Paints and they are not as durable as PPG's
&gt; products, and take longer to set up, and there flow characteristics are
&gt; terrible.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; And refinishing any oxidized metals puts you in the same category, the
&gt; metal must be super clean, sealed with some sort of acid etch primer,
&gt; filled with a high fill primer, then refinished.

Just looking for a little confirmation here, as most of the posts I've
read say that after priming, you need a top coat of paint to seal and/or
prevent rust, while for POR-15, you theoretically do not have to paint
unless you want to and/or the part in question is going to be exposed
to light.  Plus, it's Friday, right?

As my first rust removal/protection job, I'm looking at doing the cargo
floor of my campmobile -- removing the small amounts of rust that have 
built
up and sealing them to prevent further rust.  That said, I don't 
particularly
feel the need to paint the cargo floor, as I don't expect it to be 
exposed to the world,
nor do I care about applying a filler, as it can remain as pitted as it
wants, I just don't want it to start rusting again a week from now.

So, do I need to paint it to seal it from the elements, or does 
Vari-Prime do
this for me.  How often will I have to re-apply Vari-Prime -- none if I
don't scratch the surface, as no water will be able to get in?

I'm under the assumption that all I have to do is use Vari-Prime on a
clean surface, and I'm set, but I wanted to clarify that before going
forward.

thanks,
