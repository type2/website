To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
ive got an easy one for you this evening.   i recently
got ahold of a childs cot out of a 68 westy and
decided to play with it a little and see how it
worked.  im not sure if i read it somewhere or heard
it somewhere but i assumed (i know) that it went
between the front doors?  well i unrolled it and it is
too small to fit.  where does this thing go?   ive got
a 73 riviera but the dimensions of the bus are
obviously the same.  help a mentally challenge guy
out:)  
thanks everyone
shelby
73 riviera &quot;lizzy&quot;

ps- glad the headlight assemblies worked out chris
