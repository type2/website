&gt;GREETING AND SALUTATIONS.

Hi. Please don't post messages in ALL CAPS.

You'll need the special Type I -&gt; Type IV tinware that was never imported
into the US. This is available from Just Kampers in the UK. The phone
number is:

	01252 371331

I forget what you have to dial before that to get England on the phone. I
just found a pile of these Just Kampers stickers under some stuff and I
don't know where they came from.
