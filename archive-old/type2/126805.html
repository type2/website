Subject: Spring Failure

Hiya All,

70 Bus.  Stock.

I heard a &quot;rotational noise&quot; (rather like shot brake linings) coming from my 
driver's side rear wheel the other day.  I pulled the drum and found that the 
upper retaining spring had broken.  The free piece was doing the noise making. 
 Pretty easily fixed.

But I'm wondering what could have caused that spring to fail.  It broke in 
the &quot;coil&quot; rather than the straight connecting piece.  I've done more than a few 
brake jobs in my life and I did make sure everything was placed and seated 
correctly.  Adding to my puzzlement.......while I was vacuuming the dust away 
from the rear plate and shoes one of the lower smaller retaining springs broke.  
What goes on here?

I think I'm running a streak of bad luck here.  On a recent road trip my 
clutch operating shaft broke in two (and not at the weld either!).  How often do 
you have brake springs and clutch operating shafts break?
