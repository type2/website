I have a '75 with a aftermarket oil cooler.  The lines are attached to a
piece that is sandwiched between the the oil filter and the block.  The
lines run right in the wrong place, namely where the air intake for the
drivers side heater box goes.  I can pull and plug the lines for the
winter but would prefer not to.  Any ideas on this one?  Also has anyone
had any experience with the aftermarket oil thermostats?  Do they only
control the fan turning on and off or is there a type that controls the
flow of oil like in water cooled cars?   Thanks for any and all replys.
