Consider that this is coming from someone who has only experience with stock
1600cc engines and single carbs...

It sounds to me like you are addressing the SYMPTOM, high heat in engine and
coming out the exhaust, without addressing the cause.

Your carbs sound like they are running real lean... it is the burning of the
GAS that causes the heat, you are just seeing it in the oil and exhaust... I
really doubt that your muffler is CAUSING the heat.

Are both heads just as hot?  Maybe one side is running leaner than other...

My question:  I would eliminate this source of heat if I replaced the
extractor/dual mufflers with a stock bus muffler.  Is a 1776 + dual Kadrons
+ stock muffler an ok combination?  The application is a daily driver
around town with occasional interstate speeds.  Has anyone experience with
this combination?
