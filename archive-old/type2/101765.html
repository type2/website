Subject: RE: [T2] removing heads

Yes its possible to remove them with engine still in the bus !!!


But its hell of a job,  removing the muffler, heat box, removing the intake
manifold, the cooling tin..

i did it once , i had the cylinder head shim broken, so i had to remove the
head them put back a new aluminium shit, tork the head...
This happened the morning i was leaving for vacation on east coast of
canada... took the bus to the shop on 3 cylinder, then doing the job all in
all took about 3-4 hour!!
