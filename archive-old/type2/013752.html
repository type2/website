&gt; Well, one of the break-downs on this trip was that the driver's side 
&gt; rear
&gt; wheel bearing *did* go out.  As John says, VW wheel bearings seem to 
&gt; last
&gt; almost forever, so it was at the bottom of my to-do list, but those
&gt; bearings are going in to the spare bearing carriers I picked up in
&gt; California.  In all my years, tho, this is the first wheel bearing 
&gt; failure
&gt; I have encountered.

Again, my curiosity has been piqued:  has anyone who experienced
rear wheel bearing failure and replaced only the one that failed, later
experienced failure in the other wheel?

I had a rear wheel bearing fail in the middle of the desert in Australia 
once (in a non-VW)
and having replaced it (by a mechanic who was genuinely surprised that
he didn't have to special order the part, as his supplier had exactly 
one left), we
spun the other wheel to find it making the same noise.  Seeing as I had
1100+ km of mostly desert between me and Sydney, I decided to
err on the conservative side and replace it immediately (despite needing 
to be
somewhere).  As a result, I assumed that this was a failure rate thing
and that replacing both bearings at the same time would be a Good Idea 
(tm).

It sounds like the transporter rear-wheel bearings are pretty bomb proof 
though,
so I'm curious if failure is a result of many factors we cannot compute, 
which may
include things like:
		a) installation error (torquing your rear wheel assembly parts 
to different values than spec, or different
			on one side than another, packing the different sides with 
different amounts of grease, etc.)
		b) bad parts (bad bearings, a poorly stamped brake drum (yes, 
I've seen one), etc)
		c) etc.

or more:
	a) driving conditions, driving style, etc., in which case I'd 
suspect both bearings to fail
		within a ballpark period of time (~10k miles of the same 
driving conditions, et. al.)

I know that you should be able to hear/feel bearings go bad for some 
time before they actually
fail, but I'm just curious if I should plan on replacing both if I need 
to replace either of
them.

cheers,
	tom
