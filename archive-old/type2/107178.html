&gt;All this talk about adjusting hyd valves is getting me worried.
&gt;I have one of those engines and my compression is good
&gt;and equal to each cylinder.  It seems to run good.
&gt;should i worry or not fix it if it ain't broke?
&gt;thanks

thanks david, all I needed was some re-assurance,
I'll check it out if and when I start to have problems.
