&gt; Has anywone installed a front tire carrier on a 78 Westy?  How do
&gt; you get to the place to drill for the bolts that pass from the
&gt; inside to the outside?


The mount I sell (for $14.95) comes with a set of inserts that you put into
the hole in your bus's nose; then, when you screw the mounting screw into
them they spread out to grab the metal.  So the entire installation is done
on the outside of the bus. Also, on '73 up busses, it uses 2 of the emblem
holes so you only have to drill two more holes.
