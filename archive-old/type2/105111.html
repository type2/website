&gt;I just noticed GoWesty! has replacement tee-molding for the cabinets and
&gt;compartments.
&gt;
&gt;I bought a small strip with my last order to check it out and it's a very
&gt;very close match for the original stuff. It's $1.25/ft. which is a lot
&gt;more that what you can expect to pay if you scrounge around the junkyards
&gt;but it's new and more flexible.

There is another supplier called Outwater Plastics. They are on the
internet and they will send you a free catalog.
