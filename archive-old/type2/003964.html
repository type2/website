&gt; &lt;&lt; I believe to use a cat on your bus it would be necessary to obtain and
fit
&gt; a
&gt;  late FI system which includes a lambda sensor. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My bus is a 79 &quot;federal emissions&quot; model with a catalytic converter.  It
did
&gt; not have an oxygen sensor when I got it.  Was it just &quot;CA emissions&quot;
versions
&gt; that did, or did my bus also have one originally?

Only 79 Cal buses have a O2 sensor. All 75 to 79 original  CAL version buses
have catalytic convertors. You don't need a sensor, 75 to 78 did not have
them.
