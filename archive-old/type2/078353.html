Subject: Front Mounted Spare Deflects Jeep at 60mph

I entered the intersection as the light turned yellow.  I was making a left 
turn onto a 2 way four lane road.  There was one car stopped at their red 
light in the first lane.  As I started out in front of the one car, I noticed 
the jeep coming at me at a high rate of speed.  I hit the brakes and the jeep 
grazed my spare tire on the front of my '74 Westy.  The white tire cover has 
black rubber marks on the bottom where the jeeps fender flares scraped it.  

The jeep kept on going.  He didn't even slow down.  The guy was coming down 
the hill toward the red light and must of thought that it would change before 
he got to the intersection.   The light was still red long after he went on 
through.  A couple of more feet further into the intersection and I might be 
dead.  I couldn't tell there was any real damage to the front of my Westy.  
I'll take a closer look later today.  I had pulled over after he hit me to 
see if he would come back, but he never did.  I called the police just in 
case.  I didn't want to be the one accused of leaving the scene of an 
accident.
