&gt; Well first, there is nothing wrong with the way a stock 68-70 bus stops.
&gt; I drive a `50 beetle with cable brakes and fully non syncro trans daily in
&gt; summer months
&gt; and honestly it stops fine.  Too many folks over exagerate, these things
&gt; stoped great when
&gt; everything is working a-1.

You have a 71 bus. It has disc brakes on the front. Your point is moot...

&gt; If the `71 with discs and a stock 68-70 MC will stop as good as a stock `68-70
&gt; I will
&gt; be a happy camper LOL....that is what i am looking for

It will not.
 
&gt; What i do not want is a `71 with power brake set up that stops like a `71
&gt; without the servo !
&gt; You are correct that will stop like shit....and will not even come close to
&gt; the stoping
&gt; power that a stock 68-70 will stop.  Thus why i consider using the `68-70  IF
&gt; it will work
&gt; that is info I am looking for.

Like Faster Laster said, there is no magic in the master cylinder. The brake
booster is doing the work.

&gt; Most folks have missed the original post...this is a HUNK of a van...

I guess so because what you said was:

&gt; The brakse are all shot.  Seems quite costly replacing all the brake
&gt; components for this vehicle and i wonder if my servo is any good?
&gt; 
&gt; My question is there a way to eliminate using the power brake servo,

What did you expect?
