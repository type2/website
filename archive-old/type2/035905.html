Subject: Genuine VW parts from dealers?

It would be a useful list project to determine what parts are still 
available for which buses through dealers, and at what prices. If we 
could somehow make up a list for all the years between '68 and '79, then 
everyone on the list could select maybe ten items (by part number) and 
visit the dealer to find out price, whether it is in stock or has to be 
ordered, etc. Then report back to someone who could organize a web page.

But I'm a bad administrator and shouldn't try to take the thing on myself.

Mark
