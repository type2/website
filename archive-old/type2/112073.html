Subject: Problems with smoking; need a good mechanic in my area!

Hi y'all,
 
I just recently joined the list. I have a '77 westfalia that I bought 1 year ago. The car is in great condition except that it uses 1 quart of oil every 250 miles. Every morning when I start it up there is a huge blue cloud bursting out of the exhaust pipe. Finally it starts running a little sketchy for the first ten minutes.
If anybody has some input in terms of what might be the problem please let me know.
 
And if anybody knows of a good mechanic in my area (Oakland, CA) please let me know.
 
Andreas
