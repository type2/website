     Volkswagen Single Cab Pickup

      1959 Volkswagen Single Cab is a &quot;fast and low covered wagon&quot;. This gorgeous bit of automotive history 
generates excitement and smiles where ever she goes. This power plant has the rumble of a V-8 Big block 
stroker engine. The first and only VW to garner a six page photo spread and technical review in Hot VW's in 
1999. The Volkswagen community has embraced this multi-show winner with excitement and awe. It also has the 
prestigious honor of being included in VW bus, the first 50 years, 1949-1999,&quot; the cult bibie of Volkswagen 
transporters by Keith Seume and Michael Steinko. It celebrates a half-centry love affair with the most 
versatile of vehicles. It has undergone a tolal ground-up restoration featured in Hot VW's, 6 page article in 
1999. 2005 updates include new two-tone paint scheme by Fair Auto Body, custom cargo cover, safari, and 
windows. The interior is custom interior by Sewfine of Denver. This show winner is an extremely rare piece of 
automotive art and is in perfect condition. Ready to drive or win &quot;best in show&quot;.
