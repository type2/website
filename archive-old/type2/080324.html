Mike and list,

My comments are interleaved below:

&gt; Hey Edward,
&gt; I think this is a great project and yes, I understand that it's a total
&gt; DIY project, which is fun in my book :)
&gt;
&gt; I have a question, though, on how you plan to integrate the unit into
&gt; your bus.
&gt;
&gt; The unit uses manifold pressure to detect the air flow into the engine,
&gt; correct?

Yes.

&gt;So, for that reason it would replace the AFM.  Do you plan on
&gt; removing the whole AFM assembly and running the S-Tube directly to the
&gt; air filter.  I know there has been discussion before about the fact that
&gt; the AFM itself blocks a significant amount of airflow into the engine
&gt; and I wonder if this would increase power (ever so slightly) and/or
&gt; cause any problems (overheating?).  I guess the extra airflow would be
&gt; accounted for anyways.

I plan on removing the AFM and entire air filter assembly since the air
filter assembly will not mate directly to the S-tube. I plan on choosing a
tall/round filter with a smallish diamter and fabricating a holder of
sorts - probably using plastic plumbing stuff - haven't working this out
yet. I don't forsee any problems regarding the extra air flow - perhaps some
benefit.

&gt; Next, I noticed on the megasquirt site that there is the throttle
&gt; positioning sensor.  Are you going to use one of these, or are you only
&gt; going to use the manifold pressure?  I don't know much about manifold
&gt; pressure systems so I'm kinda curious how that all works out...

I've decided not to cobble on a TPS. Initially I'll get it running without
any acceleration enrichment. Then I'll probably modify the code to increases
in manifold pressure to trigger acceleration enrichment - the code right now
uses increases in throttle position. I've looked at the code modifications
needed for this and it's quite trivial.

&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Mike
&gt;
