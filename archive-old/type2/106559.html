Subject: Re: [T2] electronic ignition??

I have used a pertronix since about the mid 90's. Same one to be exact.
Yeah its true. You want one.
You want one NOW.


&gt;Was talking to my mechanic Sam tonight and he said it would be a good idea 
&gt;to install an eltronic ignition in my bus (1600 Single). He said that then 
&gt;you don't have to worry about the points or timing anymore.
