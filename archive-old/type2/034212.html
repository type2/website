&gt; &gt; I'm no tranny expert, but far as i know, autos started in 73 in

you would also need the front shift mount/tower because the detents are in

&gt; as a minimal number of junkyard donors.  My personal preference definately

&gt; is (in my opinion) a better match for the slightly underpowered bus engine
&gt; than the automatic's 3 speed configuration.

there is another side to that discussion too, the Automatic more closely
matches the speed and power ranges with the actual needs of the van, it
also prevents one from lugging or overrevving the engine too.  And again
in city driving it will last longer, and no clutches to replace or adjust

(OH yeah, it is only possible to easily put hand controls on the
automatic, and all major brands of lifts and hand controls fit with little
or no modification)
