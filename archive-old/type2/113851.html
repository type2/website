&gt;Which budget is best 5 years from now??? $YYY dollars for compromise and failure then $xxxx dollars to fix it right, or, just $xxxx to fix it right in the first place. Whether you have that $YYY dollars five years from now depends upon not wasting it now.

Ah, but you are making assumptions, Herr Stephens.  Assuming that $xxxx is significantly more than $YYY, your options are actually:

a) Spend $xxxx now to fix it right (the clear-cut solution).
b) Spend $YYY now and invest ($xxxx-$YYY) in stocks/bonds/pay off debt.  Depending on the amount invested, the rate of return and the length of time until the engine fails catestrophically, you may well come out ahead even if the engine fails at a future date.  Of course, there is always the chance that the engine will not fail catestrophically at all, but have a normal service life despite it's shameful origin.  In that case, you will be WAY ahead.

Think for yourself - very few things in life are as clear-cut as people make them out to be.  It's natural for people to want clear-cut solutions because it takes less work to come up with them - doesn't make them right for you though.  If the motor had good oil pressure, good compression and didn't make bad noises, the odds are good that the bottom end of the motor will have a reasonable service life.  If you are willing to bear a slightly increased risk of failure on the road vs. a quality rebuilt short block, then save your money (or don't run up that credit card).
