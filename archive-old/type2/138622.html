Subject: Re: [T2] Travel to Denver: High road or low road?

Ratone Pass. A kick ass climb but take it easy and then once over there is 
almost no further climbing till you have to go over Monument hill on I25 
just southof denver. If it is snowing that hill can Eat you. Lots of wrecks 
on that hill every time it snows. By the way, when you come down off Raton 
Pass you enter the town of Trinadad. It is the place to go for sex change 
opperations in the US. More done there than anywhere else in the US (not 
talking from personal experience). Have a safe trip.  Cree 79 Bay BlueBlob
