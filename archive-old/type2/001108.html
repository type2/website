Hello,
Well PADME made her first trip to Bug-o-rama this saturday. She made it
there fine and loved seeing her family. However on the way home she started
stalling out when she was supposed to idle, as long as I was giving her some
gas then she stayed running however everytime I let off the gas even to stop
she stalled. anyone seen this? any ideas where I can start troubleshooting
this error?
Thank you.
Scott Beaupied
