&gt; The most common cause is short run driving. Just change the oil more often
&gt; during periodic maintenance. Also, make sure the mixture is adjusted
properly.


Whew....that is what I wanted to hear. That did cross my mind because I do
alot of short trips. I only live about 2 miles from work. Does this oil
getting into the fuel system hurt anything? Or does it just get burned with
the rest of the fuel?

Thanks
Jasan
