&gt;The problem is, there is no way to determine the condition. It's all

There must be a way to soak it that won't harm the diaphgram inside.

&gt;I don't know what the replacement specs on these were, but I'm pretty 
&gt;sure it wasn't every 25 years.

After 100,000km VW expected you to buy a new VW.

&gt;And what if one of those nasty gunk pellets gets dislodged, runs 
&gt;through the throttle and plenum, down the runners and into the intake 
&gt;port? Do you really want that inside your cylinder?

No but it's a long path from the PCV to the intake port on the head and it wouldn't stick around in the cylinder for long.
