&gt; Although I'm going to miss Everybus this year (broken hearted about it), I

Bummer, I was hopeing to link up with you and carabus!

&gt; I live on MD 301 just north of the VA border in a town called La Plata.
&gt; This is south of Waldorf ( a slightly larger town).
&gt;
and the last decent stop for gas and grub til near Richmond.

&gt; If anyone is on the way and needs assistance, I have room to park, even camp

and if your coming down the coast this is THE WAY to go, bypasses all the
traffic in DC. and I-95 in Northern VA.

&gt; if need be, and make repairs.  I am fairly handy with a wrench as well.
&gt; So, if you find yourself in the area and need a hand, give me a call.
&gt; And yes, I'm also listed on the AIRS site..  LOL

great guy and nice place too. and not bad with a wrench...will miss your
dark blue bus though, is the bus ok or are you missing because of
mechanical problems, could help with parts and assistance??

take care
Bob
