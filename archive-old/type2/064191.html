&gt;   The engine in my bus is a '74 1800cc twin carbs engine with sodium filled
&gt; exhaust valves. The valve gap for these sodium thingies is 0.08, while the
&gt; intake valves (not sodium filled) are set to the usual 0.06.
&gt;   So the answer to your question is yes, but don't ask me why...
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;   Ciao,

Oops I think we're missing a zero in each of those numbers ;-)
