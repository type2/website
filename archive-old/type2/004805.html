Subject: Re: [T2] 1600 cooling tin for 72-79 Bay Buses



. A poster
&gt; posted a website for some company in the US about 4-6 weeks ago, that
makes
&gt; a complete kit for this conversion, with what looked like a fibreglass
piece
&gt; for tin, and a rear hanger for the rear mount. I wish I still had the
&gt; address, but I formatted a while back and lost it. Does anyone know who
has
&gt; this kit?Tom
