&gt; &gt; 68-69 mirrors mount lower and have a rubber buffer against the

&gt; &gt; I've got a couple of NOS ones around somewhere.
&gt; &gt; I'd also agree that you need to have your rear torsion bars set up a
&gt; &gt; little.
&gt; 
&gt; But, alas, they do not fit in '71, '72, '74 or '79 Type IIs.
&gt; I dont know about other years, those are the only ones
&gt; I checked. I have a really nice one I grabbed for $2
&gt; to put in my '71, but it just wont go. Too small.

Sorry to hear that! I'd bought these because I liked the one on my 69 so
well!
If anyone needs an inside  mirror for 68-69 I guess they're for sale!
