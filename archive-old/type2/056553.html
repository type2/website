Keith, and everyone else,

If all is working as I hope it is, there is no way to get the list of
addressee's from the list server.  Neither is it available by asking.
If anyone wants to send you their address, they are welcome to do so, but
the list of adressee's is strictly private!

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.
