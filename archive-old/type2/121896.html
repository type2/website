Subject: RE: [T2] Brake light switch replacement-2 switches???

I just did this , Fist check the fuse!, I did this last like a dummy:). 2nd
you can take a wire and cross the 2 parallel connections on the plug  to see
if your lights come on. 

hope this helps

Subject: [T2] Brake light switch replacement-2 switches???


Hey Y'all,
I have just come to the realization that my brake
lights are not working (71 westy). The bulbs are
confirmed good, so I am assumning that the switch on
the master cylinder has gone bad. So 2 questions:
1) Is there a way to troubleshoot the switch to be
sure  AND
2) There appears to be 2 switches connected to the MC
with wires going to each. So why 2?  Do both switches
need to be replaced?? Or is one of the switches for
the brake warning light on the dash??
