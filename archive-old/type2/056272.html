 were so big, I could have nearly gotten the German stuff 
 for what it cost me to get a professional glass installer to 
 moan and groan with them for  30-40 minutes a piece 
 threatening to break them with every other breath.  He 
 (glass guy) said the rear hatch rubber was &quot;wrong&quot; and 
 he just slipped the rear hatch glass in -in a couple of 
 seconds using the rear side seals instead.  hmmm!  
 Maybe the rear hatch seal would have fit the rear side
 glass better.  I haven't tried the rear hatch *door* seal.   &gt;&gt;


I have used the rear hatch glass rubber in place of the side glass rubber
after being told it would work.It is a little snug but fits very well.
