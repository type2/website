Dave, Pat:
Often the worst offender is the S-shaped boot that connects the throttle valve to the AFM. These
start out as pliable rubber, but after 20 years in high heat envirionment can crack and let in
false (unmeasured) air. The 2  or 3 other big vacuum hoses connected to this boot can be gently
squeezed shut with a c-clamp to see if it makes a difference. Of couse, the AFM's DO wear out. I
have a couple of known good ones to interchange.
The very worst offender, though, is the head installed temp sensor.Temp sensor II.
I often find them loose or unhooked, or out of range (approx 2500 ohms at room temp).
Good luck you'll find it!
