Tom,

    I think I read on your first post that you had striped the engine down
to the long block? Did you take the distributor and fuel pump insulator
block out? If so the distributor drive may be &quot;climbing&quot; in the case, and
locking up on the crankshaft drive gear! Put the dis back in and see if the
problem go'es away. If this is the problem, you will have to start over on
the end play.
    It just seems that if the end play was tight enough to lock the engine
up, it would not &quot;rock&quot; back and forth or move at all. Also, like the last
post read, if the movement is main bearing/case slack you have much a larger
problem the wrong end play!
    Let us know!
