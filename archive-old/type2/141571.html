Subject: Far-out Sighting on the Pa Turnpike Northeast Extension

So I was heading back to Bryn Mawr this evening from the Poconos, where the
Westy is garaged.  As I pulled out of the Mid-County turnpike interchange, I
saw the darnedest thing:

A flat-lime-green school bus with a frontward-facing bay window welded to
the top of the bow and a backward-facing Vanagon welded to top of the stern.

I would have turned around and chased it to get a photograph if traffic
weren't so heavy!
