&lt;&lt; I Have recently acquired a 78 Bus and it is missing the seal between the =
 engine compartment and the engine tin.I have looked at several websites =
 with Bus parts and can not find this seal can anyone get a part number =
 for this seal or a parts supplier who would carry it and its exact name. =
 I was told i need to get it replaced soon or the engine will run hot.  =
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Mine was gone, too.
Got one at Bus Depot, forget the price, but it was pretty cheap.  Easy to 
install, too.
