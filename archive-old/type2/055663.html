&gt;Just thought I would add my $.02 worth before this thread gets killed.  The
&gt;parrafin/kerosene approach to waterproofing may well indeed work, but this
&gt;will make your tent very flammable.  You would basically be making your tent
&gt;into a giant candle.

You've all seen that film of the Hindenberg?  Something like the
parrafin/kerosene thing was done to the outer skin to make it gas-tight.
That is what made it burn like that.  Oh, yeah, and it was filled with
hydrogen.

(Hard to believe, but most of the people on board survived.)
