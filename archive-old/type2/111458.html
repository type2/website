Subject: Trip Report, LA to Carson City to LA.

A quick trip report.

My father passed away, so I had to take a quick trip
to Carson City to handle his affairs.  The trip up highway 14 and US395
was uneventful and I cruised the whole way at 55MPH and a bit slower on
the 7000 and 8000 foot passes.  I did 411 miles in about 8 hours,
including stops.

The trip home was more interesting, as I had a bit more of a load.  The
load consisted of a legal size filing cabinet full of documents, a coffee
table, two end tables, about 20 pieces of radio equipment in boxes, a
couple of tool boxes, a motorized miter saw, my personal luggage, several
VHF radio antennas, and the piece de resistance, a large sofa on the roof
rack.  The bus was sitting pretty low on its springs by this point!  I
didn't weigh anything, but estimate the load at about 1500 pounds or
more.

As I started the trip, I noticed that the 1600DP engine was a bit more
sluggish than normal, even at the 4700 foot altitude of Carson City.  It
seemed game, though, so we headed south toward the High Sierra.

I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of the bus over the passes.
I had expected to have to drop to second with the big load, but the bus
climbed them all in third, just a bit slower than normal.  The temperature
stayed in the high 70s, making it easier on the engine.

Once down from altitude in Bishop, I ran into the thing I dreaded most,
headwinds!  That sofa on the roof really added to the wind resistance of
the bus!  The wind was blowing strongly right on my nose, so I just
held the throttle at about 3/4 and let the bus find its own speed, which
usually varied between 45 and 52MPH.  The trip took longer that way,
but I didn't want to strain the engine as the temperature rose into the
90s.  The headwinds didn't abate until I got to Palmdale, almost home.

US395 alternates between 2-lane and 4-lane divided roads, and I was by far
the slowest vehicle on the road that day.  Some have commented that other
drivers behave in a rude or hostile manner when encountering slow buses,
but I did not see one instance of this.  When cars approached from behind,
I'd scoot over as far as I could into the breakdown lane and let them go
by.  In almost every case the passing driver gave a friendly wave as they
passed &quot;The Little Engine that Could&quot;!

The bus really ran like a trouper on this trip.  It didn't use any oil and
I didn't have to put a wrench on it despite rather harsh usage.
