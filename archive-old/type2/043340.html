Subject: So Long &amp; Thanks for all the Facts

The good news is I get to build my dream garage (plus a house for the
Frau).

The bad news is my budget is limited [meaning I have to do a good bit
of the work myself] and that leaves too little time to read the Type2
Digest in the morning with a cup of coffee....  Tomorrow I must issue
an 'unsubscribe' command.

I've met some great guys [both genders] in ~6 months on the List.  If
you have a knotty problem in the areas that I can address, I will try
to respond to p-mail.

I wish each of you happy Type 2 Volkswagening until we meet again.
