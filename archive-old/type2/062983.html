Yes, I have used it: so far, so good. I'm talking about their original
product, the black paint that goes over surface rust and seals it in. I
used it on parts of the undercarriage and have refrained from covering it
up with rubberized undercoating just so I can keep an eye on it. It has
survived one very cold and very salty winter. The real test, of course,
should be much longer.

I used acetone as a solvent, but it didn't work all too well, so I suggest
you also order their own special solvent although I haven't tried it and
don't know what it's made of.

I also tried their heat resistant paint and was NOT impressed. For one
thing, it should not be painted over rust (unlike the name would suggest).
I used it on a new and shiny part of the exhaust system, after having
stripped the original grey paint and carefully degreased the part (it's
the short pipe that goes from the elbow to the muffler, where later model
breadloafs would have a cat. converter). The paint is coming off and the
pipe is now very rusty. On the other hand, I also painted the muffler and
it has held up much better. Don't know why, maybe it's somewhat cooler.

Michael Heron keeps warning people about an allegedly very toxic substance
contained in the paint, but I didn't see any warnings on the can. It may
be wise to investigate first.
