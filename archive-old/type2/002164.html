Hey Guys,

Well, I've still had no success with finding or adapting a tow bar to my
bus.  So, I went ahead and pulled it home on a flat bed trailer (yeah, that
was a fun tow).

I cleaned the motor, put a spotlight on it, and added a little oil.  A
little bit of oil began dripping out from above the Oil Filler Pipe.  When I
touched the Rubber Bellows (the little rubber piece that goes over where
your dipstick fits in) oil went everywhere!

It seems that at the bottom of the Oil Filler Pipe there is a Rubber Bellows
that fits where your Oil Dipstick goes in.  (Bentley Manual; Chapter 5, Page
25, Figure 9-1, Part #12)  Could this really drain every bit of oil out of
my Bus?  It doesn't look like this little piece of rubber is all that well
mounted on there.  Should it have a hose clamp on it?  I'm suspect that the
entire Oil Filler Pipe Assembly may need replacing.  By the way, my motor is
a 2.0L 78 non FI.

Any help or insight would really be appreciated.

Thanks a ton,
