I had someone steal my Airflow meter and registration sticker once.  Got
in the car and started it.. tried to drive and it was just MUSH!  Boy
was I annoyed.

Got myself an AFM, but I got pulled over so many times until I finally
got that sticker.  What a mess.  I'm going to definately try and find a
keyed lock for that back hatch.  Or maybe put a cable actuated latch
that has a pull line in the bed of the rear compartment.  That way, you
need to pull up on the cable and it allows the engine compartment to be
opened.

	I prefer the solenoid operated un-lock.  Press a button(or alarm
remote) and voila!  Open door.  I would also suggest to anyone who cares
about their vehicle as much as I do, to invest in the alarm.  That little
blinking LED really does ward off the unruly...
