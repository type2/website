&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have a three part question about a 78 Westy (FI) I
&gt; am restoring.
&gt;
&gt; First, I noticed the brown wire going into the voltage
&gt; regulator has had its insulation melted off, has
&gt; anyone had a similar problem and if so, what are the
&gt; likely causes?

If the engine is not grounded to the frame with a heavy ground cable (same
guage as battery ground cable ) , the brown wire takes all the current,
which is to much for that size wire, espesially if you keep spinning the
starter over and over trying to start it.

Joey.
