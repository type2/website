Subject: How much material for Westy curtains?

Hi Folks,

Norman, our 72 Westy is in storage for about another two weeks..Still
waiting for the last of the snow to go up here in Ottawa, Ontario.  In
the meantime, I thought I would treat him to some new curtains.  Anybody
know how much material I would need to cover all windows using the old
cutains as a template?

Much appreciated.

Craig
