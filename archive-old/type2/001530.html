    Hi All.
  I'm having some problems with the 73 Westy. Stock 1700 dual Solex carbs.
  It's running extremely rich. Black soot in the tail pipe. Black puffs of
soot from the exhaust when you give it gas and excessive fuel consumption. I
had the R/H carb off for a rebuild recently and it has been running great
till now . Ialso have an exhaust leak due to a loose exhaust stud at the #1
head to stack joint. Fairly minor though.
  I'm thinking about starting from scratch as to setting up the carbs per
the Bentley manual.
Under Fuel System pg.15 Adjusting dual carbs,step 1 is checking the throttle
valve opening and adjusting to .004&quot;. It says to adjust the gap and then
secure the screws. Is this adjustment made with the throttle valve stop
screw?
  Obviously the carbs have to be off to measure this?
The fast idle setting measured with the choke fully closed (fig 5-30)pg24,
is adjusted with the connecting rod nuts. The carb should be off for this
too?
      I have always set my carbs using the data from pg 16 Fuel System
(To adjust idle), but this won't bring up my idle which is now about
750rpm. I'm hoping if I pull the carbs and do the set up as above I'll be
able to adjust the idle up and decrease the richness of the carbs.
   Sound confusing but I've set the timing,dwell,etc. and nothing else seems
to help.
    Any suggestions?

Thanks
Phil Gowdy
