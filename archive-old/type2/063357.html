&gt; Well, I got a computer desk in there today, and I've done a couch, thru the

We did a console TV (one of the old models w/ record player at one end, 
radio at the other). Also carried 16 10'or 12' tall trees... sticking 
out the sunroof... it looked like a rolling forest with trees out the 
top and bushes hanging out the open hatch.

A friend carried a yard or two of bark-o-mulch. He stuck a piece of 
plywood behind the rear seat, sticking out the sunroof, and had the guy 
dump bark through the roof until it was above engine level. He nearly 
wrecked when bark came swirling up front and got in his eyes. :)
