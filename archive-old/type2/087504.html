Subject: Re: [T2] overcautious rod install question

they came out of my vw; they apear to be vw rods compared to those i've
seen both in books and around vw garages. none appear to be ground off - i
hadn't noticed they were on or off before i took them to get pin bushings.
at the machine shop i checked the new bushing for fit and noticed the they
had been through a parts washer, but not until i got home to assemble did i
say to myself, gee wiz, no forge marks and no fresh-looking grinding on the
rod. so i'm still at gee wiz - anybody on the all numbers up or down?   -
