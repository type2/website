Subject: RE: bus trailer hitch

Hey All!
How weird!  I just picked up my '72 (yesterday) and it came with a trailer
hitch
that seems to be a VW Dealer option.  I have a SuperCab Ford 4x4 that I tow
with so I know I'll never use it.

It says...
Manufactured by Gibbes Machinery Co. Columbia, SC
Part Number 209
It's somewhat clean, has a lite coat of surface rust, needs a cutout in the
bumper to fit, but other than that it looks like it would work.

What's it worth?
BTW I'm in Walnut Creek, CA


Thanks!

I am looking for a trailer hitch for my 73 Westy.  Anyone on the list
have one for sale or know where I can get one?  I would prefer one that
is a VW accessory but will consider others.
I need one to tow my 69 Beetle Convertible to shows this season.
Thanks in advance,
Al
