&lt;&lt; A used vacuum advance distributor is no worse than a used centrifugal 
 advance distribitor.  With either of them you want to disassemble them, 
 clean them, re-shim the dog gear, and grease the advance plate.  With 
 The vacuum advance you have an extra step of testing the vacuum cannister.  
 All the &quot;failed&quot; vacuum advance distributors I have ever owned did not 
 advance were due to a gummed up advance plate, not a bad vacuum diaphram &gt;&gt;


i am interested in hearing more about how to rebuild dizzys. this is something
i have never done.  is there a manual on it or a tech article??
