&gt; Don't tell the EPA.  On a similar note, a few
&gt; months ago I spoke with an old Dubber (he was
&gt; mostly a KG guy), who advised putting a half
&gt; gallon of diesel in every tank for aircooled
&gt; VW's.

In a word, no.

Back during the 70's fuel &quot;crisis&quot;, a station near Tucson AZ was offering
gasoline that had 5% diesel fuel added.  I was an mechancical engineering
student at the U of A at that time.  We got a 5-gallon can of the stuff
and ran it through our octane test engine.  I forget the exact numbers,
but I can tell you for sure that definitely reduced octane.  Remember that
Diesel engines work via detonation, which is Bad News for gasoline
engines.
