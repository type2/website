&gt;&gt;Most are non-recirculating. I think (but can't yet prove) that '70 was the
&gt;&gt;only year for a recirculating B 2.
&gt;
&gt;Actually, to make a B 2 recirculating, you just need the plastic ductwork,
&gt;and another hole below the dash. I prefer using the recirculating heater, as
&gt;it does not blow cold air into the car when it isn't being used. The flap
&gt;that blocks the air when the heater is turned off doesn't work very well.
&gt;The 2 B 2's I have came out of a '68 and a '71 bug.

As an aside, and to change the topic slightly to BN4s in buses, the early
BN4 (68-71 bus) also did not have recirculating air ductwork.  I retrofitted
the later model BN4 2 piece plastic ductwork, metal hood and grill and cut
the extra hole at the rear of my bus and I was very pleased with the
results. Not only does the bus interior seem to warm up faster, but the gas
heater fan and hot air route is protected from stray elements in the engine
compartment (like oil mist or gas smell from leaky carb bushings, etc.).
I'd recommend this upgrade for anyone running an early BN4 in their bus.
