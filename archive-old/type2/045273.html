Subject: [T2] Exhaust systems

Unfortunately, I was premature about being excited about finding a 76
exhaust system. It looks more like a 72 that's been modified with what
looks like a cat or glass-pak on the tailpipe (?).

I've had two conversations via p-mail mentioning Bus Depot's catalog blurb
about using the 72-74 heat exchanger on a 75-78 Federal bus. They say,
&quot;You'll have to modify your engine tin slightly to do this conversion.&quot;

How do you need to modify your engine tin? Do you just need to replace the
lower left tin that covers the push rods? Or is it more extensive than that?
