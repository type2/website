Subject: '78 Westy Front Axle Rust

My beloved '78 Westy has developed a pretty bad case of rustiness on the
part that I would call the pillar (or shock tower) on the driver's
side.  Around the lower torsion tube, there is considerable metal
missing.  Has anyone found a repair kit for these?  I have seen them for
the Bugs, but not the bus ball-joint suspension.  Has anyone
manufactured a home-made replacement?  I have the welder and am pretty
handy, so might be able to cobble something together, however, if anyone
has a ready-made solution, I might save the effort of reinventing the
wheel.

TIA-- :&lt;)
