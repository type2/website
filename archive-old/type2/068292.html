I love having a working horn -- to let people know I'm there when they are
backing out of parking places without looking. I'd really hate to have a
smushed front end that could have been prevented ...  PS, my husband
test-drove the faded red '69 Beetle he was refusing to buy, and it is
sitting in our driveway now, ours for $700. &lt;BFG&gt; It looks really nice and
shiny with the rain today. Does anyone know of a Beetle email list? I've
been looking on the web and finding nothing ...

'82 Vanagon
'69 Beetle
'88 Grand Prix (I had nothing to do with buying this one.)
