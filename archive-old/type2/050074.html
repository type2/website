Subject: [T2] Newly Rebuilt 1800

I have a friend who has a newly rebuilt '73 1800 with a Solex H-34SEIE. He
has 250 miles on it at this point, and just pulled the plugs and they are
very black. I have convinced him that he needs to come down here tomorrow
to celebrate new years, but he is concerned about driving it. I don't have
a carb, and really don't know what to tell him, except to try leaning out
his mixture. Any words of wisdom that I should pass on to him? He is
planning on changing the oil before he comes down, and then when he gets
here (It is about 250 miles). Oh, he said he is running straight 30 weight
detergent oil, which seems fine for AZ. The archive mentions tightening
the heads again at 300 miles. Thoughts on this practice?

Thanks,
Nick
