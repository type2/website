Hi George,

Slight misunderstanding. I am very familiar with the t-stat and yes I know
it does continue to regulate the flaps at lower OAT during and after
warm-up.  I was only referring to starting a cold engine at any outside
temp...the flaps are closed and therefore a t-stat is needed...just trying
to paint a pix to those who say &quot;it's warm enough here and you don't need
that thing&quot;.  I think I see now you were saying the flaps opened fully after
warm up at idle/no load at 60F OAT.  That of course means they also open
fully at somewhat lower temperatures under load.

&gt; George, maybe I don't understand what you are saying but...

&gt; I just grabbed a brand new 65-70C t-stat and my Fluke digital thermometer
&gt; and in 120 F water it remains completely contracted.  Not until ~145 F
does
&gt; it even start to open with ~160 F the point of full expansion. Outside air
&gt; temp is completely irrelevant anywhere on planet Earth, which further
&gt; indicates how mistaken those &quot;mechanics&quot; are who think t-stats are
&gt; unnecessary.

You've got half the picture!  You're absolutely correct about the
thermostat not opening until 145F.  Cold outside air travels throught he
vents, through the fan, past the cylinders and finally past the
thermostat.  The thermostat regulates the outlet temperature by throttling
the airflow.

The whole idea is to keep the cylinders at a set temperature.  The system
is set up so that the cylinders get sufficient cooling at 100F OAT with
the flaps wide open.  However, what happens when the OAT is cooler?  IF
the cylinders are cooled to 250F at 100F OAT they will only get up to 150F
when the OAT is 0F, since the heat transfer is a function of the
difference in temperature between the incoming air and the cylinders.

Obviously, 150F is too cold for good engine operation.  The solution to
this is to limit airflow and allow the the cylinders to warm up to 250F or
so.  The thermostat &quot;throttles&quot; air flow to make sure that the cylinder
temperature stays high enough.  If the outside air is cold, the flaps are
kept more closed to maintain the same exit air temperature.
