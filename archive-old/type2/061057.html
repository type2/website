&gt; Practical and knowledgeable peoples I mean VW engineers did chose
&gt; Eberspaeher heater as the ultimate way to beat the cold almost 40 years
&gt; ago! Do you want one, brand new? In stock! Original for your bus! That
&gt; is the way to go!   Ark &quot;THE HEATERMAN' dealing heaters for over 35
&gt; years. Installation is simple, you do not need advices of fools who
&gt; think after work is done or do not think at all!
Ark:
All right, you're on! How much for a new Eberspacher? I'd like nothing
better for my 69 double cab, and I'm sure that there are 100-200 other
listees that would like a practical and knowledeable solution to the
heat problem! I do think you're being a little harsh calling us fools,
however. (I did say do both!)
