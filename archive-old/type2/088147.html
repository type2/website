&gt; &gt; Sorry for the &quot;technical&quot; subject. I'm trying to find out where I can
order
&gt; &gt; those little plastic clips hold the screens in place on louvered windows.
&gt; &gt; Some of mine have disintegrated. Anybody have a part number for these
&gt; &gt; things.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How do other people hold in their screens on their louvered windows?
&gt;
&gt; Steve,
&gt;
&gt; On my '73, the screen frame lifts into a deep slot at the top of the
&gt; window, then drops into a shallow slot at the bottom.  I have no plastic
&gt; clips at all.

Correct, gravity holds them in. The little plastic thingies are there to stop
the screens from rattling.
Early screens, like 68 to 71, had a little plastic tab on the top and bottom
that you would twist to hold them in tight.
