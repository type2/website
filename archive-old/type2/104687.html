Subject: Re: [T2] side marker lens

I have a set that have lasted a long time.  They came from the factory ;^)  
Sorry, I couldn't resist!  I doubt you can get a decent set of repros that 
will last as long as the originals did.

Eron




Has anyone gotten a set of side marker lens that have
lasted a long time and is satisfied with them?  If so tell me where
you bought them and I'll go there.

Thanks for your help.

Bradley,
