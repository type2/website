     tod et al:  took '82 vanagon &quot;the kroetcher&quot; (named after old pal
 gregory roderick kroetch -- krutch -- of bavarian roots) to fred's garage
 in redwood city (ca) today -- fred's is a-little-bit-of-wolfsburg vw
 specialist
 in the silicon valley with german-born owner and german-trained vw
 mechanics.  was told essentially what tod said a few days ago -- drive it
until it either drops or you can't shift it anymore and gotta tow it in,
 and will rebuild transaxle for about $1,100.  historically, bus and van
 transaxles are the toughest part of a tough machine (if cared for, of
 course) so this could range from months to years.  the whine is very
 slight so i'm hoping years, knock wood, since it's no longer a
daily-driver.
 planning to hit tahoe soon and will see how she goes.  anyway, thanks all
 for your feedback.  cheers, art '82 vanagon, san fran

&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; ....Is this the sounds of wear?    Tired gears?  Dry gears?
&gt; &gt; &gt; The beast runs fine, in any case.  Any thoughts?....&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Could be, could be, yes, could be low on oil, nice to hear for
&gt; &gt; &gt; a 17 year old Van....
