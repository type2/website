If you do destroy them I do have NEW German door and gate bolts (screws)
with the correct head size.

Hey everyone again:
What is the easiest or most effective way of taking off the large 
screws/bolts that hold the truck gates on a single/crew cab that won't 
destroy them??? And if they are destroyed what is the thread pattern of 
this large phillips head screw?? Again many thanks in advance!!

Vic
