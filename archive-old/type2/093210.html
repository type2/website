Subject: Re: [T2] bus stopped in a bad place

At 09:48 AM 8/30/2002 -0700, you wrote:
&gt;my bus was running great. Then SUDDENLY started
&gt;missing badly and lost virtually all power. (In the
&gt;middle of downtown, of course)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Does anything leap to mind?

Fuel starvation.  Rig up a temporary auxiliary gas tank.
I epoxied a couple of inches of metal fuel line, with rubber
fuel line ALREADY ATTACHED, into a hole in the bottom of
a plastic oil bottle.  Put a small hole in the top of the bottle,
so the fuel can flow out.  Attach this to your carb(s)., keeping
the bottle higher than the top of the carb(s).  See if it will
run now.  If you can keep it running this way, measure the
fuel delivery from your fuel pump, per the instructions in the
Bentley Manual.

My bet, is that the screen in the gas tank, the fuel filter (if present),
the filter in the pump (if present), or the filter(s) in the carb(s). (if 
present)
are clogged.

Measure the fuel pump rod, while you've got your hands dirty.

Also check the needle valve in the carb(s).  I had one come apart
on my bug, shutting that carb. down.  I was able to limp home
on the other two cylinders, and pull a new one from the spares box.
Now I carry one in the car, with the spare accelerator &amp; clutch cables,
fuel pump &amp; rod, fuel filters, and distributor--complete through spark plug 
wires.
