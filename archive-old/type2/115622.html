&gt; For those of you who currently have air shocks or coil

&gt; stupid thing!! Please help.

That really depends on where you live. They have Lowe's in Ohio right? Try
them.

Otherwise, get the phone book and look under Fasteners in the yellow pages
and locate a supplier of metric hardware with whom you can develop a
life-long relationship. Ask each vendor whom they recommend.

The upper shock bolt is M12 x 1.5mm pitch and give them the length of the
shank you require. It's probably grade 10.9. Don't ever skimp on the grade.

Many sturdy metric fasteners come from Europe from a company called Bossard
International. If you can find a Bossard reseller, you can find VW
automotive bolts. What makes it hard is that many bolts that size have a
courser thread. Sometimes they'll look at my request for a M14x1.5 bolt and
ask me if that's an automotive thread.
