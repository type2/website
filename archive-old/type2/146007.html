&gt;Plus, it seems that the
&gt;009's maximum timing setting at 3600+ RPM was only about 32 degrees BTDC.

The limit depended on the manufacturing and what you set the static advance to.

&gt;I saw a vacuum-advance distributor on www.BusDepot_dot_com that looks promising as
&gt;a replacement/spare dizzy for my '79 FI bus. It's $129.95 and is touted there
&gt;as being the perfect replacement for all air-cooled VWs, from early Beetles
&gt;and Buses to Bays and Vanagons. I've heard that it's made or marketed by VW de
&gt;Mexico.

It turns out to be a great replacement for a 76-78/79Fed FI bus. It also works well with other models.

&gt;The current distributor on my bus, a Bosch 0231 168 005, is a
&gt;vacuum/centrifugal-advance model with a single vacuum line. The base timing
&gt;for this dizzy is 7.5 degrees BTDC at ~900 RPM. The maximum advance using this
&gt;dizzy is 40-42 degrees BTDC _at_ 3600+ RPM, which seems designed to increase gas
&gt;mileage at cruising speeds. (I've been running a Pertronix Ignitor I in the
&gt;dizzy for the past ten years with no problems.)

021-905-205P is the VW number for Bosch 0 231 168 005. It's the stock distributor

&gt;Does anyone have experience using this Bosch SVDA distributor (VW # 043 905
&gt;205) on a Type 4 engine?

No issues except for the fact that your are installing a T1 dizzy. All this means is that you'll have to reorient to rotor from where you think it should be because the vacuum can on beetle is in different location. The end result is that the mark on the dizzy body for #1 won't be point to #1 (it will point to another plug wire).

&gt;What is the timing setting in degrees BTDC at 3600+
&gt;RPM? Will it advance far enough?

Set your timing to 7.5 BTDC as usual. I've actually graphed the distributor and posted teh results to the list:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/Misc/DizzyCurvesVac.gif

Compare 205ZB (the Bus Depot unit) to 205P (factory stock unit).

&gt;Does it use the standard 01 011 points, 04
&gt;033 rotor, 03 010 cap, etc.?

Yes.

&gt;What is the Bosch part number?

0 231 170 034

&gt;Is it a good
&gt;candidate for a one-size-fits-all distributor?

Yes.
