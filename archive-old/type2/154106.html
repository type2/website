&gt;OK folks, just got off the phone with my Bosch Corporate mole and heard it
&gt;officially - VW 022 906 045 A / Bosch 0280 140 101 Auxilary Air Valve that
&gt;fits thousands of 75-79 FI Bugs &amp; Type 2s, Vanagons thru 85, the venerable
&gt;74 412, 76 Porsche 912E &amp; 914 1.8 is no more.

The Bosch master parts catalog listed it as obsolete back in January but the
stocks apparently have just dried up which is a pity.
