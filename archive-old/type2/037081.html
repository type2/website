Ok, i still dotn know why the dns died yesterday (started on the 7th
actually..), but anyway.

The machine is back online for the moment, some of your mail have been
lost, i dont know.

We had .better. go back down for a half hour or so .very. soon for a small
hardware upgrade that is long overdue.

thanks, and sorry for the trouble.
