ours are custom made. We use the BEST O2 sensor available (it's also heated
for more consistent operation). Our gauge also goes to 12:1, not just 12.5:1
(all the other guys).

The reason for this is that under full throttle operation should run 12.5:1,
and if your gauge STOPS at 12.5:1, you don't know if it's actually 12.5:1 or
11:1 (for example).

Make sense?

Lastly, all my testing has indicated the cheaper gauges aren't accurate
(they peg at full rich or lean, even when the engine is operating in the
middle) or are slow as a snail at responding to changes (ours is instant).
If an A/F gauge isn't accurate, it isn't doing any good whatsoever.

&gt; How is yours different.  Are you guys using a different kind of O2
&gt; sensor?

&gt; &gt; we will have a unit available within two weeks that blows away anything
&gt; &gt; currently available under $1K. Ours will sell for $229 for the whole
kit.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;normal&quot; operation with the cheaper units often includes the meter
pegging
&gt; &gt; to full rich or full lean, even when the engine is operating normally at
a
&gt; &gt; good A/F ratio. Another one is where the meter takes FOREVER to respond
to
&gt; &gt; O2 levels. These are both very common with the cheaper kits, so do your
&gt; &gt; homework.
