Subject: Re: [T2] on the road again :)

Hi Drew,

&gt; I have some minor problems still to iron out.  My
&gt; turn signals stopped working, but the hazard
&gt; flashers still work...I'm sure that they share
&gt; the same relay, all I get from the turn signal
&gt; lever is a steady indicator light
&gt; in the dash (left and right) and nothing from the
&gt; lights themselves.

I had the same thing last winter on my 1971 panelvan.
When I slammed the cabin door the turn signal would
blink a few times and then hold still again. I
replaced the relay and since then it works perfectly
again. So I would try replacing the relay if I was
you.
