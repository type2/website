Subject: trip report...and pertronix question

Folks,

Saturday Preparation for a trip to OKlahoma city from NW Arkansas(261 
miles one way).

Checked over the bus and found that my pertronix was reading 42.7 degrees
dwell...hmmm...not good.  swapped points back in and set them to 50 
degrees....anyone else ever have this problem???  Verified with two 
different meters, one I have had for years and one that is digital.


This is my AVP rebuilt that I have about 900 miles on in the 78
Champagne edition.  I was going over to near Oklahoma city to 
pick up a **new** A/C...still in the box from where I worked 20+ years 
ago(Volkswage Products Corp).  Thanks Richard!

My Mom decided that she wanted to go, so we left at 6:20am this morning 
from Fayetteville(arkansas)...temperature about 50 degrees.  I had changed 
the oil and filter yesterday and gotten the stock points back in and had a 
full tank of gas.  This si the first &quot;real&quot; road trip for Champagne 
edition,. so I was a little concerned about how things would go.

We just rocked and rolled down the interestate at about 70 until we 
stopped for gas about 150 miles down the road.  Oil filter external temp
was about 190 at the coffee stop(measured with a laser thermometer).  I 
decided that this was a good thing!  Started right up and we didn't stop 
again until we got to the place we were going.  I passed two Vanagons, one 
with Aridzona plates and one with Oklahoma plates.  Neither one of them 
waved, winked, of even acknowledeged that we were there...what is the VW 
community comming too!????

We picked up the new A/C and then stopped a short way down the road for 
lunch.  Finished lunch, fired up the bus and rolled out.  We stopped 
twice on the way back(261) miles.  Once for gas and once for a smoke 
break.

We made the 261 miles back in 3hours and 50 minutes....average speed
of 68mph.  I got *exactly* 17.54 miles per gallon on both legs of the 
trip.  I generally ran between 65 and 80 mph.._dot_depending on the up side of 
the hills....there was a wicked 5-15 mph cross wind, but it was bothering 
the big trucks too.

It was real scream watching the folks blasting by me at 80+ in their 
suv's.  I saw at least two ladies in the co-pilot seat almost break their 
necks when the realized what they were passing.  LOL!!!  A few people
nodded, or gave a thumbs up, but the SUV ladies were a trip!

All in all a great trip.  Now to get the **new** A/C in and see how much 
power it robs.

ummm...and go wash off the 5 billion bugs that decided that the front 
of the bus was as good a place as any to die....including some that looked 
more like the size of birds than bugs!!

Cheers, dave
