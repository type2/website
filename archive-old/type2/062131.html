&gt;Sorry to be dense, but could someone explain this to me?  I thought
&gt;backfiring was caused when a cylinder detonates at some time it's not
&gt;supposed to, like well before TDC, or on the exhaust stroke.  Usually
&gt;related more to incorrect timing, connection of the distributor wires,
&gt;etc.  How does the exhaust system affect backfiring at all?

It can also be caused by an air leak near the exhaust port... cold air
getting sucked back into the cylinder.  Very bad...
