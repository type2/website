Subject: Re: [T2] Motor Changes For the Bus (Vrooom, etc.)

The parts for the Porsche engine are about 5 times the price of the same
parts for the Type IV. How about $50 for a distributor cap, $16 for a
rotor?

I know a running, no papers 3.0 or 3.2 from an SC or a Carrera is worth
$5000. A papered (maintenance records) engine is worth another $2500. I
don't know about the 2.4 or 2.7 litre engines, but I'm sure they are
similar. A word of advice: if the CIS or Bosch EFI aren't working right,
replace them with carbs. Check out prices on parts at PelicanParts_dot_com as
well as info.

BTW, the 1976 912E had the same T4 engine as the 914. And the 914-6 is a
real rarity. The engines are like gold - actually gold prices are a little
low right now...

On the positive side, the Porsche 6 engines are actually more reliable
than VW engines because of the materials used and the tighter tolerances.
