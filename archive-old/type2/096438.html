Subject: Re: [T2] I have MegaSquirt on my '77 bus ...

Ed,

I thought that was you with the Megasquirt, but wasn't sure.

I too am interested in your mileage.

I bought a tps that should work well and will only use the
tps and map sensor on mine to start with.  Maybe the o2 sensor later.

Ed(and others), I want MS for all of the reasons already discussed, but I 
intend to get some side benefits as well.  A display that will fit in my 
dash that will tell me rpm's and cylinder head temp based on the sensor
that is already there...and the functions that currently exsist in the
Megasquirt ECU.  It could also tell me intake air temp as well.  In other
words, anything that the ECU knows about could be displayed on a small lcd
display.

Think about it....rpm and the other stuff essentially for free with a 
little hacking on the code.....for instance....I want my air conditioning 
to work again on the bus....about  code that will turn off the 
compressor when the ecu senses that you are going wide open 
throttle....the ecu will turn off the a/c compressor just like on your 
late model u.s. cars....


I intend to make Meagasquirt work with my crappy engine first and then 
rebuild the engine to utilize it properly.

Tell us about power and response with Megasquirt???...better? worse?

Do you really think that the afm chokes off the intake that much?

Cheers, dave
