Subject: Sunshine Daydream

Well its this weekend. If you aren't coming you can delete this email.
http://www.72camper_dot_com/sunshine.htm


If you are coming please take just a minute to email me with whatever you
can bring for the Breakfast Burritos or Hot Dog/Hamburger dinner so we can
keep track of it better. We could especially use your famous Maccaroni salad
or other dishes. Just a bag of chips would be nice.

The weather forecast couldn't be better. Only in the mid 80's and no rain.
Partly cloudy so you won't get burned. :0)

If you have any doorprizes to donate please see me in the multi-colored bus.

If you are interested in a trip to the zoo let me know. Especially if you
won't be there til Saturday afternoon.

See you this weekend. Don't forget there are good directions up now and
there will be signs once you get off the highway.
