Subject: anyone wanna help?

Hi all,

I am looking to do some work on my 78 westy this summer, but I really
lack the know how.  I bought it last summer and popped a new motor in
and now I'm looking to do some electrical and body work.  If anyone in
the Chicago area or suburbs of Chicago is interested in having some
restoration fun please drop me a line.  I want to start by doing some
electrical work, which I really have no experience with and then move on
to the body.  What type of electrical work you ask?  Well I know I want
to start by dropping in a new windshield wiper motor and try to get the
little windshield washer squirters working again.  Then I want to figure
out why my rear defrost won't work.  Who knows, maybe a new wiring
harness.  Anyway if anybody out there is interested in giving me a had
please drop me a line even if it is just for some quick advice.
Thanks
Sean
