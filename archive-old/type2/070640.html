This just in from Walter.

The 18th Annual IVWA Spring Nationals will be held Sunday,
April 22, 2001 at Farmington Dragway.
New re-designed web site should be up next week.
Our isp sold out to an out of town firm and we are starting
all over with a new one. Over 8,000 pieces of mail will go out monday 
morning. Anyone wishing to be put on mail list should call
336-766-1707 or email ivwa50_at_hotmail_dot_com

If you were sitting on the fence now is the time to fall off :)
