Subject: New rear brakes

Hi all,

Just got back on the list after a week off work.  Spent the best part of 3
days running in and out of the house to dodge the rain while replacing the
rear brakes.  I really need a bigger garage!  I replaced the backing plates
as well because they were rusted through.  Thanks to the helpful replies I
got from you listees the other week, I knew what to expect.  The only hard
part was that dowel holding the back plates on.  As I pounded on the rusty
remains, I wondered if I should have taken up archaeology instead.  But the
two halves parted company eventually, and after a lot of scraping I was able
to see where the back plates ended and the bearing housing started.
We tested the brakes on a quick camping trip to the North York moors, stayed
at a nice Forestry Commission campsite in Cropton Forest and had a trip on
the steam railway.  Fantastic views and plenty of good places to walk, we
will have to go more often.
The brakes still feel a little spongy though, I will probably have to bleed
them again.
