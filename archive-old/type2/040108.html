Assuming the EGR valve was working OK and not blocked off, the effect should
be a small amount of unmetered air entering into the system at partial
throttle and a resulting leaner mixture.

You're right, replacement EGR filters aren't cheap but they can be had.
Block off both ends of the system (i.e., under the EGR valve and at the
connection to the exhaust) if you don't replace.

&gt; I'm putting on a new exhaust system that has a place for the EGR to
hookup.
&gt; It turns out the PO just sawed up the EGR filter and I guess it's been
&gt; sucking air from under the bus. What kind of effect would this have?
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering, do I cap the EGR both the egr to the engine and the exhaust
&gt; or buy a replacement? Replacements don't seem cheap, actually I've not
seen
&gt; one for my 77 bus.
