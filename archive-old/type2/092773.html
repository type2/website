Subject: Re: [T2]windshield repair


&gt;I've got four body repair problems:
&gt;
&gt;* both battery trays have large holes
&gt;
&gt;   Going to ask to weld in two new pieces

Either supply them with the correct patches or cross your fingers that it 
looks good. It's unde rthe battery so it shouldn't be a big deal. Ask how 
they will prep after the welding to keep the rust from coming back. With 
they use a rust treatment or just wire brush it and spray? Solid bead or 
spot welds?


&gt;* rusty hole forming at right of rear valence due to hit pre-1980.  This was
&gt;hidden by the bumper and I didn't notice it until I took the bumper off the
&gt;remove the engine.
&gt;
&gt;   Not sure how best to get them to repair this.  Advice?

They'll grind it down to see what it looks like. Then they will cut out the 
rust and weld in a piece of scrap metal to fill the hole. Then lastly they 
will grind, sand, and primer, and paint. The question is what have they 
done to the back side of this repair to keep it from coming back in 5 
years? You can probably get in there with POR-15 or some sort of zinc paint 
to coat it after you get the bus back. Same for the battery trays.

&gt;* some bozo key'd the whole left side in 1995 and left serious idents in the
&gt;body pretty good.
&gt;
&gt;   Easy for them to figure out...

High build primer.


&gt;* The point of this email and worst of all, three bubbles under the
&gt;windshield are getting large and rusty and one I can start to see through
&gt;one from the inside.
&gt;
&gt;What is the best way to repair this?  One guy said he was going to take a
&gt;piece of metal and bend it the same and weld it in.  Wouldn't it be easier
&gt;and cheaper to buy a replacement panel and cut out the piece that's
&gt;required?

Depends on the quality of the metal work they do for you. They could do it 
with a nice thick gauge of steel. Maybe heavier than the replacement panel 
you could buy.

However the replacement panel would have all the right contours. If you go 
this route - supply your own.

Pull your dash before you deliver it to them. It will make it easier for 
them and it will make them happy. This may translate into a better result. 
Also when they are done you can get into that portion of the body and 
rustproof before you reinstall the dash.

Lastly the dash requires alot of wire removal but is far from difficult if 
you mark everything. I prefer to leave the switches on the wiring and 
simply remove the switches from the dash.

Take pictures, mark everything, put everything in baggies. I've pulled 
maybe a half dozen dashes in my time and after a while they seem very much 
alike. If this is your first one, it might seem impossible. By doing it 
yourself you can feel confident that it gets done right.

Don't look at the whole picture but rather at one step at a time - 
disconnect headlight switch, steering column, cig lighter, heater levers, 
radio, defroster, accessory jack. Done. Now remove the screws in the door 
jambs, at the parking brake, and then along the base of the windshield. 
There is more but that is basic idea.


Ciao!
