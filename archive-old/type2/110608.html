&gt; &gt; ... so I guess it's all your sense of value's or
&gt; interpretation of soiled
&gt; and junk--...
&gt; 
&gt; Or...
&gt; 
&gt; It's all in what's more important in your life at the
&gt; time.  Food and
&gt; shelter for your family, or a $3000.00 to $5000.00 paint
&gt; job for the bus.
And $3000-$5000 for paint for a VW bus is ludicrous!
I have been sitting here reading this thread....it's a
frigging bus! The god's honest truth is a $350 Maaco or
similar paint job over a properly prepped and body-worked
job by yourself will not be any different to ANY of the
eyes on this list!!!!!!!!!!!! Spending all that $$ is
insane!!! If you are restoring the bus as many apparently
are...and are doing your own work everywhere else, why not
continue?
Heck! you can even apply the paint yourself. there are many
paints that you can apply that are so forgiving you can
just wetsand out any imperfections, go to finer grit, than
polish just like the pro's do and voila!  ;-)

The largest expense needed when painting your own is the
compressor. DO NOT BELIEVE that you need a $400. paint gun.
GO to Harbor Freight, and get aregular binks 7 copy for
around $20. and than spend another fifteen for a matching
touch-up gun, and maybe ten? for their good
airbrush...that's all!

Than you can chat aroundand find the paint to use(I am not
current on all the ones available now, but am using Nason,
which can be tricky, but very inexpensive(tricky on
verticle panels, so need to be careful or get rips to sand
out..)

oh! and in regards to stripping down to bare metal?  Why?
if ther is no rust or damage, prep the pold surface,
feather in paint edges, use primer etc and go. a little
extra origional paint is better protection for your bus. 

oh! and the paint and other supplies needed will run you
around $100 on up depending on which ou use...)


ok...rant off...back under my rock('80 westy as the '78 is
still in my friends drive engineless....)
