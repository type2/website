&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I will stick my neck out here and issue a WARNING, I believe the type of heater
&gt; you describe consumes oxygen and emits CO2.  I think (again someone correct me
&gt; if I am wrong), but co2 is tastless an odorless, this means you die quietly.
&gt; snip!

i am pretty sure you are right, a warm blanket/sleeping bag is a lot less stressful imho than wondering if you are going to be awake in the morning?

perhaps one might consider a co (carbon monoxide is the tasteless odorless one i think) meter than you can buy for your house. they sell battery powered ones that you can mount anywhere. i am sure that the manufacturer would distance themselves from any liability about using a product that was designed for a house in a car but it might be better than nothing??

then again maybe it would offer a sense of false security??

i appreciate people initiative/inventfullness in finding new ways to heat but i think for my purposes that it is a lot less stressful buying a warm sleeping bag and insulating the bus..

i would hazard a guess that even a &quot;perfectly functioing&quot; set of heater boxes is probably emittnig trace amounts of co so it may be that if you did have that CO meter int he car and running that it would activate the CO. It is for that reason that I keep the vent window slightly ajar when drivnig w/ the heat on
