        Thank you all for the perspective and thoughts about fuel injection.
I really like the idea of these Lucas injectors for $30 that John Anderson
mentions.If I could get that to happen I'd be happy as a clam. I just
checked out Autozone on the web and  find out that they are located in just
about every state but the one I'm in. (Washington)Looks like maybe Advanced
Auto parts is in New Jersey.
       Does anyone know where to get Lucas fuel injectors on the web? I
guess I'll call these two companies on Monday.
     Thanks again ,  this is a great forum.

&gt; for the bus and vanagon are about $30 each from Autozone or
&gt; Advanced around me.
