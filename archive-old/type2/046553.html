&gt; Has anyone on this list ever taken a long distance trip in an automatic VW bus?? How did it do on the mountains?? Did you have to shift to 2nd?? 

me and my 78 auto tranny will go just about anywhere.... now I am in the
Mid Atlantic area but have had my bus in Northern Maine in winter from
Baltimore, and Grafton Notch going into New Hampshire is a good stiff
climb and I managed 35 MPH all the way up.  After I got home found out I
made most of the trip on 3 cyl!!!  thought it was a little hard to start!

yes they can handle it
