Subject: Re: [T2] crankshaft--removing dist. drive gear

Speaking of dist drive gear.. the bronze one on the crank shaft,,,

Have any of you run into a case that has been reworked in such a fashion that it
required an undercut dist drive gear?

We used to machine the case halves a few thousands... along the centerline of
the case... this would allow you to align bore the case back to std. bearing
bore size.

Instead of align boring it .010 over for main bearings...

Yes,, that meant the engine was a few thou narrower , so a single port manifold
set up would have to have the manifold tweaked a little to get it to bolt on..

Sometimes this meant the dist would not drop in far enough...  but by
undercutting that gear,, it would put everything back in place...

I know we didn't dream this up... &lt;I don't think&gt;  so there must have been other
rebuilders doing the same thing.
I think Vw of Canada did it,, and stamped a  &quot;0&quot; mark on the case

I wondered how many folks had problems with this and didn't even know it.. it
was such a subtle change,, something you didn't measure for on a later
rebuild.......

A little off topic,, but there were other reasons the engine actually got
narrower... like machining 0.250 flycut into the heads.. that made the engine
1/2&quot; narrow... and then the single port manifolds had to be cut and coupling'e
back together like the dual port intake system...
This effected the tin as well,,, tin snips solved that problem..
But resurfacing the case halve centerline was the toughest to over come that
drive gear
