Subject: So, you wanna be a bus-owner, huh? (ideas, please)
Message-ID: &lt;19991009024920.23445.rocketmail_at_web111.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

All,

I'm about to pull a complete overhaul on my web-site
(converting to frames, I'm afraid....it's about to
jump from 6 pages to 14 &lt;!!!&gt; and I think it will be
easier to navigate),...I also have an idea for a
page... One that gives some seriously
thought-provoking info to people thinking about buying
a bus for the first time.

Now, I *don't* want to talk any future bus-owner out
of what can be a very joyous thing, but I want to
offer pro's/con's of doing so.

I won't waste bandwidth on telling you what I have so
far, but if any of you want to kick in some insite,
please p-mail me and I will include everything that I
find pertinent.

Again, I want to show *both* sides of the coin, here,
so I need both good and bad...


Thanks.
