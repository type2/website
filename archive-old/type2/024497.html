Subject: re alternator problem
Content-Disposition: inline

Thanks to all who gave me advice on my poor charging system.  Well I
removed the alternator to have it tested again, and this time it tested
bad.  The replacement unit they had for the bus had a different casting
(too deep)  so they rebuilt my own.  I installed last night and this solved
the problem of not charging at idle and the light being on.

Thanks for the suggestions.
Graham
