Subject: 009

ok i know this subject gets beat to death, but, i am timing my 1600dp, 
34pict3, 009, 71 westy tonight with a fancy timing gun with a digital 
reading.. as i have always just timed my bus by ear, and how the driving 
felt, i was wondering if any one could tell me what exactly my timing should 
be, this way i can get it exact with the fancy shmancy gun. ..  thanks.. 
peace. scott. 71 vesty (only backfires every now and then =) ..
