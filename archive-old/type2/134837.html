Subject: Wind Sheer

List,

Oregons Willamette Valley has been blasted with 48 mile an hour winds lately
and Freidrich has been buffetted relentlessly.  My suspension and drive
train was completely refitted within the last two months and has been
driving, turning and stopping perfectly.  I just don't see it improving much
more than it already has.

My point here is:
What is it about the mechanicals (not the obvious aerodynamic issue) that
causes a bus to be tossed about in wind so much more than an Econoline which
is almost equally aerodynamically challenged?  Semi's seem to have it easier
than busses.  I am certainly not the only bus having to manage this issue.
I drove home behind a bus that belonged to some other commuter yesterday and
he was dealing with same issues.  I'm thinking its an engineering issue?
please lend me your opinions and experiences.
