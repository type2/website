I have a set of CAL heat exchangers from my '81 I would like to get 
rid of. They are the ones with the left side shaped funny to allow for 
the CAT Conv. One had to be welded but its a good fix. They weigh 
a a lot so shipping would be a little expensive.- $50 plus shipping 
for the set. Or best offer.
