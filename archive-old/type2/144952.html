&gt; That's the best part.  I can cruise fairly
&gt; comfortable at 65 with a 1600.  Don't tell the T4
&gt; guys here, they say all drive 85mph.  Never mind
&gt; that VW listed the top speed at 72.  The ones on
&gt; Thesamba_dot_com say they drive around 100 or so coz
&gt; they all have Porch engines.

Cruising speed numbers can vary for a number of reasons.  If I went by my
speedometer I would say that I cruise at 75MPH in my meximotored '71.  If
I apply a &quot;testosterone factor&quot; to that number I would brag about 85MPH
on the lists.  The GPS tells a different story: 62MPH.

The reality is that I cruise between 58 and 62MPH.  The bus feels
comfortable at that speed and that makes me feel good.
