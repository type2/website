&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than the bug connectors and he doesn't know of anyone who has them.  RMMW
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't list them in their catalog, but I haven't called them yet.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are these really scarce?  Should I expect it to be a dealer only item?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anybody have any other recommended sources?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; I saw some advertised in J.C. Whitney. Don't know how they work though.

&gt; &gt; J.C.Whitney tends to be generic in their merchandize (See: &quot;One Size Fits All&quot;).
&gt; &gt; I'd be wary about purchasing something like this from them.  Even after the
&gt; &gt; technician assures you over the phone that it will fit your model.  BTDT.

&gt; Don't pay any attention to the California fruit and nut crowd. I've bought a lot of 
&gt; parts from JCW that work fine.

I don't see any smileys in your post, so I have to assume your remarks are
beligerent.  My experience with J.C. Whitney has been 50/50.  I was assured
that by a J.C. Whitney technician that I did not need a magnetic pickup for
the car that I was purchasing a cruise control for.  Sure enough, when I
got it, the manual specified that it needed the pickup.  So much for 
expertise.  So why you must be a snotty asshole about my post is beyond
me.  You obviously are vary narrow minded and full of yourself.  Don't 
trip over you ego, asshole....
