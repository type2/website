Subject: Sender Wiring: Over or Under?

Greetings All...
I gearing up to finally install an oil temp gauge, and am looking for the
best routes for running the wire from the sender up front to the cockpit. 
I'd prefer to somehow run the wire through the interior of the bus to avoid
heat and other exposure-to-the-elements damage to the wire -- does anyone
have a good route for this?  (Sender up into engine compartment and into
inside of bus somehow?)  I haven't seen any posts on doing it this way, so
hopefully it can be done.  If not, I'm also looking for the best under-bus
wiring routes as well -- especially those that avoid hot components and
don't require drilling.  (Zip ties are at the ready.)  I've also seen where
people use vacuum hose, certain tubing, and other conduits to protect the
wire near the engine (I can't visualize this down there; sounds awkward) --
any tips on this type of approach would be appreciated as well.

Also, a related question:  I'll be mounting the sender in the sump plate. 
When reattaching the sump plate, do the two bolts need to be tightened to a
specific torque -- as with the oil strainer bolt nearby -- or can I just
tighten as necessary?  (I won't reef on it in any case.)

I truly appreciate everybody's help on these, and happy Friday!
