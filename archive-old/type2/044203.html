Subject: Fw: [T2] stripped bolt

&gt;i was reinstalling my push rod tubes (72 westy, stock engine) and i stripped
&gt;one of the bolts that holds the rocker arm to the head, Bently lists it as
&gt;quality 6 G. Does this mean i cant go to a local hard ware store and buy a
&gt;new bolt? Do i have to go to the dealer?


take a closer look, this fastener is not a bolt, it is a stud.
and a tricky one at that. it is a step stud, meaning it
has two different size threads at opposite ends, with the
additional tricky section which centers the rocker shaft.
it comes in only one grade of hardness, and is not found
at fastener supply or hardware stores.it is a dealer item.
