&gt; To my knowledge all 74's came with a type4 1800 w/dual
&gt; carbs. Your FI 2.0 was not original equipment (U.S.A).
&gt; 74 1/2?

True, the 2.0L was not offered til 76. But not all 74's were dual carb. The
1974 Calif version 1800 with auto trans came with FI. Very rare but
available....  Standard trans came with carbs.
75 all states got FI.      *This applies to USA vehicles.*

&gt; I am haveing a serious problem.I have a 74 1/2 VW Van
&gt; that has been completely and loveingly restored for
&gt; my Wife and daughter to drive around in. The original
&gt; FI2.0l motor was blown and I have replaced it with a
&gt; 1978 FI2.0l engine. After much hardship ........
