&gt;Dear fellow bus lovers,
&gt;
&gt;As a young boy I grew up in a major city with a father who bicycled to work
every day. I was fourteen before we owned a car. I never saw my father
repair any car. I had no friends  &lt;&gt; 
 In short, I grew up as a clean , art loving woos.

&gt;2) If I am to enter this dark greasy world, what basic tools do I need?
&gt;
&gt;3) What would be the first job I should attempt? I think my front wheel 
&gt;bearings might be going out... When I corner at speeds over 20mph, I hear 
&gt;a lower, sort of growly noise.
&gt;
&gt;I'm pretty good with electrical stuff so suggestions more in the 
&gt;mechanical realm are probably more appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;What have I let myself in for :)

  I have seen no replies on the list so here I come to save the day!

 I couldn't resist the editing I did to your original!   :-)

 I have a FAQ on tools that I copped off the newsgroup.
 Written by Steve Johnson. Is he still around?

 If you would like a copy, (it's not too long) give me a knock.

 If the list would like to have a copy posted so we can argue merits
like &quot;what the hell is he gonna do with the hatchet?&quot; say the word.


 My own award for &quot;unsung hero&quot; tool goes to the magnetic &quot;pick me up&quot;
has truly saved me a dozen times.

 Front bearings will be a good place to start. Do the brakes while you have
it apart.

 You should have the Bentley &quot;Volkswagen Service Manual&quot; and/or the 
 Haynes manual for your year vehicle. before you start.
 
 Takes some of the mystery out of it all.

 If these PHD's can do it, so can you!

 Affording it on these buses is not always the only question.
 
 When I find some one who cares more about saving my butt than me,
then I'll hire him.

 Until then I'm stuck.

 You are letting yourself in for some work and maybe some enjoyment
and feeling of self-reliance.

 You wouldn't be here if you hadn't already made that decision.

 Unless you're looking for the restroom.  :-)
