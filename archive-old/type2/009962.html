Subject: 1968 Kombi Price Question
Message-ID: &lt;19990624173203.12259.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

I have a 1968 Type 2 Kombi which is my daily driver.  I am pondering with 
selling it(which I know I will later regret).  Any ideas on what would be a 
reasonable price for such a bus?  Inside it still has all of the original 
cabinets, table and the bed. The only cabinet I don't have is the sink, 
which I have not figured out if this one had it from factory. The wood 
panels are still there.  I made an awsome center console between the front 
seets which has 2 midrange speakers facing the back, a cup and change 
holder.  The motor is a 1600 single port which I put in it; it has about 
12000 miles.  The tires have the same mileage on them.  The only cabinet I 
don't have is the sink.

It needs to be painted.  It has almost no rust.  It need the window seals, 
they currently don't leak only because I put silicon around them while at 
school.  I didn't have the money to change the seals.
Breaks are great.  New CV joints about 6000 miles ago.  Mechanicaly I take 
very good care of it.  The heater channels work.  I took it on one trip to 
NC last December from Miami, FL(which is where the bus is located).

Your help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,

Joe
