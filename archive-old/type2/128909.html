Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Camper flooring questions

Hi Jay,

The Westfalia factory used plywood and linoleum for the floor. My 
westfakia has a 1/8&quot; masonite base with laminate flooring on top. If 
you pick a good brand of flooring you should get many years use from a 
single $25 bundle.

Happy trails,

&gt;  did the campers have a plywood sheet layed over the corrugated

&gt; way to get carpet and other floor coverings to lay flat.  If so, how 
&gt; thick of a piece is this?
