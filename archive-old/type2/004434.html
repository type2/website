&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. My bus originally had AC and the condensers are mounted between the
frame
&gt; &gt; &gt; members (under the cargo floor) with a 12v fan blowing down through
it. There
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a galvanized cover running between the members that is louvered
open
&gt; &gt; &gt; towards the front of the bus.  Looks like an ideal spot for the
radiator - run
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fan all the time.  Any thoughts? Will she cool with a stock jap
rad?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. There is some talk of using the suby bellhousing.  Why?  Won't the
adapter
&gt; &gt; &gt; plate allow me to mate the engine right up to the tranny?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Exhaust. Am I looking at a complete fabrication?  Something like
this looks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Quick question: how are you doing your radiator?
&gt;
&gt; Clark, Jim:
&gt; I've thought about conversions for a long time. Hobert Kennedy always said
the
&gt; radiator needs to be in front in the air flow. The NICEST setup would be
to get the
&gt; nose, radiator, and heater assembly from a Mexican bus. Salvage yards are
pretty
&gt; bare of these things, but I wonder what NEW parts would cost? Any Mexican
listees
&gt; with access to a parts book? Hmmm... I wonder if I could get a waterboxer
to fit in
&gt; the 69 double cab?
