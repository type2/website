&lt;&lt; Guys,

Just read that one of the local flaps sells a relay conversion
kit so that when you switch to brights, your low beams stay on as well.

I don't need a kit for this, but am wondering if anyone can think
of a reason why you *wouldn't* want the low beams on at the same
time. &gt;&gt;

Without answering the question; just curious...Is that conversion for
a two or four headlight setup?
