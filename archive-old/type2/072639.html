Subject: thermostat rod path
Message-Id: &lt;v0151010fb363d97a57c8_at_[207.172.43.81]&gt;

I think the procedure for installing the fan housing is to mount the
thermostat rod in the vane assembly , secure it with the clip, start the
threaded end of the rod into the slot in the head, and then lower the fan
housing into place.  This seems easy but  has always caused maximum stress
for me as I try to avoid bending the ___ out of the rod in order to place
the housing over the oil cooler.

On my Berg heads, and I assume on every head, there are two possible slots
-  one nearly square, and one more rectangular.  Which slot does the rod
pass through?

Thanks, Jack
