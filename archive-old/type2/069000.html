Scott -
Try used book stores, and surprisingly, thrift and second hand stores.
Saw many older manuals during a recent *shopping* trip.  No VW, 
otherwise A) I would have them or B) I would have offered them to the 
list.  But with your mention of a BMW, I'll keep my eyes open.

&gt; I'm looking for a place that has out-of-print / hard to find owners 
&gt; manuals.  Not only for VW but also for (specifically) a '76 BMW 2002.
&gt; Are there businesses like this or will I need to just go junkyard hoping?
