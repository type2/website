Subject: TYPE 2 74' bus w/ backfiring problems at high rpm's.

Hi,

I have a TYPE 2 74' bus with multiple problems. I have a weber redline 32/36 carb and a .009 distibutor w/ an  electronic
ignition. When you sit still and run through the rpm range everything sounds fine. The timing has been set for 32  degrees
total advance and the carb has been set according to the weber specs (best lean idle). When you actually drive  the bus,
the engine begins backfiring around 3000-3500 rpm. At this point you cannot do anything other than take your foot  off 
the
gas to correct the problem. Do you have any ideas as to what might cause this?

Thanks in advance,

Ryan Seal
