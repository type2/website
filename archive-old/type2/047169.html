Subject: Re: [T2] stud replacement 

&gt; come out?  Exactly what does a weak stud look like?  Can unbroken studs
&gt; be replaced with minimal effort and the engine in?  I know nothing, so
&gt; please feel free to share.  The studs in there now don't look too bad,
&gt; enough of thread on each of them.  They're a bit rusty, some more than
&gt; others. 

speaking of which, I pulled my engine for the first time last night
with the help of a knowledgable friend who was happy to direct me
and provide moral support (thanks bob!) and when I pulled off my 
header last night, I noticed that one of the studs was stripped --
not so bad that I couldn't get the nut off, but bad enough that
it needs to be replaced.  Is this just a matter of getting some good 
wd40 in there, grabbing it with a vice-grips and twisting it out?

I assume to replace it I just put some lock-tight on the new
stud and torque it in?
