If it is a type 4 motor it could be the rear crank seal.

Subject: [T2] leaky oil pump I think


&gt; Hello all ,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again for the help up till now.
&gt; I've got a serious oil leak coming from dead center in the rear (rear is
&gt; rear) of my engine.It only leaks after the engine has run for several
&gt; minutes and not after it has been shut down. I've looked up at the oil
&gt; cooler and I don't think that is it. I suspect the oil pump. I'm screwed
&gt; on getting a new one till labor day weekend ends. After looking at it for
&gt; a while the only way I can see to access it for assesment and possible
&gt; replacement is to put a floor jack under the motor and remove the motor
&gt; mounting bar. Does anyone know a better way?? This won't be to bad but I
&gt; figured I put it out there to the collective wisdom of the list.
&gt;
