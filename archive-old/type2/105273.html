Subject: Re: [T2] Hard BRAKES!!

&gt;&gt;It did help after I put new calipers
and front pads on, now the rear brakes are pretty far out of adjustment,
would this cause the problem?&lt;&lt;

Ian,

i would say give the rear brakes the needed adjustment &amp; see
what happens.

as a general rule of thumb (but not always), if the pedal is
HARD, then the fault lies in the brake booster.  if the
pedal is SOFT, then the it's probably the master cylinder.

i can't remember which direction for star adjustment, but a few
months ago someone on here suggested to mark the backing
plates with an arrow once you get it figured out. that should
help with future brake adjustments.

good luck.
