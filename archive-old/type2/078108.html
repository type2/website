chicken and the egg? In an ideal Otto engine, you don't need a cooling
system. Why not? I have customers with 9.5-11:1 on pump gas (though not in
busses) running cool as a cucumber with stock cooling systems. Run 8.5:1 on
a stock or mild cam and burn it up in 5K miles.

&gt; You left out a very important factor, that is, that you have more heat to
&gt; begin with (before detonation) created by more compression of the mixture.
&gt; If all other things were equal and you got identical energy conversion the
&gt; higher compression would leave more residual heat.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;However, basic thermodynamics (Thermo I) shows
&gt; &gt;that you are converting energy into mechanical
&gt; &gt;motion. The more we convert, the less leftover
&gt; &gt;heat we have.
