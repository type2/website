VOLKSWAGEN PLANS THEME PARK .... It wasn't enough to buy Rolls-Royce and
Lamborghini, Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech also wants to build a
monument to the company he rescued from decline, according to &quot;The New
York Times&quot;. &quot;Auto City 2000&quot;, a theme park being built at a cost of
nearly $400 million near Volkswagen headquarters, is a testimony to
Piech's consuming ambition. It will feature at least eight separate
pavilions to showcase Volkswagen's brands, a luxury hotel, a yacht pier
and a museum that will let people test-drive cars in virtual reality.
Volkswagen also says it plans to bolster Rolls-Royce and Bentley
production to 10,000 cars a year from 2,000.
