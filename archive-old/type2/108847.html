Subject: RE: [T2] Brake Booster Line...

Too small could  reduce the response time of the booster.  Much too large
would create a large vacuum accumulator which may cause engine problems
during rapid throttle changes. I would guess that you could get away with
slightly larger than stock. I don't have any hard data on this, other than
experience with hydrualic &amp; pneumatic systems.

You might try just cleaning up the stock tube.

	Quick question about the brake booster. When I was inspecting the
lines this weekend, I noticed that in a few places, the brake booster line
has some rust on it. The Bus has VERY VERY little rust to begin with, but
only a few isolated spots underneath. Just surface rust really.. but on the
steel brake line.. it appears as if it's beginnign to scale a little bit.

With that in mind, I was considering replacing it. I want the Bus to be
functional, AND original looking, but I don't mind so much about changing
things &quot;under the hood&quot; since the Bus doesn't have the original motor
anyway.

That said, is it required that I have a specific diameter of line going from
the carburetor to the brake booster?

Or can I use.. say a large steel fuel line most of the way?
