Subject: 1600 vs 1641 ???

Markus,

Yes, there is a slight improvement in torque with the 88mm jugs.

Your engine is actually a 1584.  Going from 85.5 to 88.0 jugs gives a 4.5%
increase in displacement. ( '1600' to 1641 is only 3%.)

But don't bother.  

The 88mm 'slipper-skirt' jugs have a poor long-term performance history,
apparently because of their thinner cylinder walls -- they pick up that extra
2.5mm diameter by making the walls 1.25mm thinner.  And while fifty thou on
the radius may not sound like much, the walls are already pretty thin to
begin with for the simple reason that the 85.5's started life as 83's (!)
 The &quot;1600&quot; engine is just a bored-out 1500.

Head leaks and pulled studs were pretty rare on 1500's, even with the 8.5:1
CR ratio used on the early Type III's but became fairly common on 1600's even
thouigh the CR was dropped to 7.7:1.  Head leaks are virtually guaranteed
when you go to the even thinner-walled 88's unless you drop your compression
down to about 6.8 ~ 7.0... which takes away any advantage you will have
gained from the larger displacement.

If you feel, as most of us do, that you need more power the best bet is to
look for it in other areas, such as balance or breathing.  While it's hard to
argue with cubes, the 88mm jugs are not a wise choice.
