Subject: Re: [T2] Zodi hot shower

Hi Michel- isn't Canada a &quot;dual English-French&quot; country (-8 ? (your site
is all french?)
Nice shower hoop.
Hmmm, way back around 1972 I bashed an 8&quot; piece of 1/2&quot; copper pipe in
the center and mounted it to the rear rack of our 71 camper.  To this I
added a hula hoop which has a string tied opposite that has a hook on
the end that went to the top of the roof rack.
Hung a curtain on the hula hoop.  The water came from a black painted
container (a 5 gallon water container from our lab which had a spigot at
the bottom), fed to a hose clipped to said string.  Today, with our 78
camper, I just tip down the Dometic awning so the front roof edge
touches ground and use 1 gal. water jugs to rinse off/shower after a
beach visit.
