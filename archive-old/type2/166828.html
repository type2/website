Subject: Body/Paint Shop in Maryland

Can't help on the two shops you mentioned Greg but spoke with a guy from Full Tilt Customs in Martinsburg WV a while back about doing the bus and it sounded good. They do a lot of muscle cars and seem like a pretty reputable shop. Talk was 4-7k for the '78 westy depending on how far we needed/wanted to go. I emailed metwiz to see if they had any thoughts on the shop or recommendations for someone locally but never got a response. I am prepared to spend the 4-7k on my '78 but would like to find someone a little closer to Annapolis that is reputable. I think you and I have both asked this question before to the list and not got much of a response. Hopefully we will this time...
