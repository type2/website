Both.  Yer cracked, Dude ! ( Hope your glass isn't 8^).
I think your windshield hazes from the inside ou, it is made of two plates with a
clear plastic center, like a sandwich ( Have you ever seen a crashed one in a
junkyard ? they stay together even after breaking. )
And so moisture gets in there and fogs it up. you will never get an installer
to seal the edge of the replacement with roof tar, you will have to do that job
yourself !  The steel wool trick is for removing fine scratches in the surface,
but you would have better luck with cesium oxide, available from a jeweler supply...
Any body else ?
