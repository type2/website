&gt;i have a 74 bus and
&gt;i have checked my pads, and the shoes on the drums and there is
&gt;plenty there. We then bleed the brakes which made them respond
&gt;somewhat quicker. Drums also recently adjusted.

&gt;Still you press down and starts to slow then foot falls little further
&gt;and then some real braking. Why is it taking so long to respond
&gt;through.

I have a '74 that does the same thing. New front pads, rotors pretty good
(I've driven on much worse!), new front brake hoses, brakes have been bled.
They always work fine, but it sure feels a bit wierd. Is this a VW thing?
Normal?

'74 Bus
