Subject: Re: [T2] really rough idle, shaking whole bus

&gt; If black smoke - CHT sensor just ahead of #3 injector
&gt; should have about 2400 ohms resistance at somewhere
&gt; around 70 degrees. Just unplug the wire (Carefully!)
&gt; and test lead attaches to wire, other to ground.
&gt; If you have 2300 - 2500, you're okay. Outside of that,
&gt; if it has more resistance, it's the likely cause.
&gt;
&gt; Did this come on gradually? -BaH
&gt;
&gt; '79 &quot;Bussy&quot; (BUSARU 2.2)
&gt;



have all new hoses.  no black smoke. no black specks on my hands when i
place them behind the tail pipes and rev the engine. new cht sensor which by
the way apperently is seated in a brass insert because the original hole and
threads became too worn and  allowed the sensor to move thus affecting the
afm.
