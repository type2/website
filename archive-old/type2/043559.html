Just bought some MaxMiler 185/14c tires today.  Would have gone with the
Yokos but didn't have time to wait a week for them to ship.  I am departing
on a road trip from San Diego to Wyoming (Yellowstone).  This is my bus's
maiden voyage.  Any advice appreciated.  Any AIRS that want to speak up just
in case?  I can't wait.  It is the fist time I have had a vacation in 6
years!  Yee haa.

&gt; &gt; He suggested the max of 205/70 14 in a Michelin MMT.  (498 per )

I run Michelin 205/70 14  M_X_T   this is a light truck tire.
