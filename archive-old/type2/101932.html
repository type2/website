Subject: RE: [T2] BBBVII

&gt;Just by chance, there were three other Sundial campers
&gt;parked next to mine! We had ourselves a mini Sundial
&gt;gathering. So cool!

Complete with a gourmet kitchen ... nice spread, Chuck! Hey, was Ronnie able 
to take care of your friend's rocker-stud problem?


&gt;I think this was the best BBB yet! Thanks to all of
&gt;the Havasu people who have put in so much time and
&gt;effort into making this event one that any Bus driver
&gt;should not miss.


I'd have to agree ... great event and great location ... now if only Chuck 
would get that generator fixed so his beer stays cold next year ...)
