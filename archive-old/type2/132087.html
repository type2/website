Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon into Bay

on 5/13/04 08:33, The Bus Depot related:
 
&gt; It's been a number of years since I put a Vanagon engine in a Bus
&gt; myself, but as I recall the only sticking point was that one of the
&gt; engine carrier mount holes is a different size on the bay block versus
&gt; the Vanagon block. I don't honestly remember which was larger.

absolutely correct, ron.

you are speaking of the screws which hold the engine mount brackets to the
engine case.

the vanagon screws are 10mm, the bay are 8mm. to do the swap you need a pair
of vanagon carrier brackets or you have to open up the holes in the
baywindow ones.

another difference is the crankcase breather, but you just have to use the
vanagon breather set, it will plug into the bay intake system.
