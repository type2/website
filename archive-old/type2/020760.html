i have seen one electric bay window conversion, but it was more of an
engineering project for students than something anything else, they told me it
would only drive 15 miles on a charge!! not very practical. it had a bank of
lead acid batteries and this big honkin industrial electric motor mated to the
vw transaxle.  however i saw an electric golf that had a 40 mile range which
was perfect for the person who used it as their commuter vehicle, he drove it
to work, plugged it in  drove it home and charged it off of his stored solar/
wind system, the guy is off grid, he sells power back to the grid and gets a
check instead of a bill from his electric company,
jamie


&gt; Now to get this back to some real Bus content, did Easterwood or
&gt; anyone else ever actually get one of those electric panel van bays
&gt; running?  That bus may not win cost comparisons but it is zero
&gt; emission.  Has anyone ever seen any of the rest of them that were
&gt; quickly and mysteriously snatched up?
