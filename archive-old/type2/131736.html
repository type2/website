Subject: RE: [T2] Bus Haiku 2004

&gt;&gt;First noise then smoke
&gt;&gt;Exhaust leaks and a lean mix
&gt;&gt;Killed my engine

&gt;man what a bummer.
&gt;did you rebuild it yourself?
&gt;or did you replace?

Hi Andy,

Bus budget is tight
Rebuilding engine myself
Hope it runs when done

Thanks for the sympathy.  It just needs new heads, so I'm not too worried 
about the bottom end.  I just need to be meticulous and accurate when 
re-assembling it -- proper torque, proper assembly technique, proper 
cleanliness.
