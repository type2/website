 Anyway I can tell you just from reading
&gt;too many FI messages for too many years that there are three
&gt;list-traditional ways to fix this problem:
&gt;
&gt;--waller out the holes in the circuit board a little and move it so the
&gt;contact is on a slightly different path, effectively doubles the life of
&gt;the airbox.
&gt;
&gt;--bend the stylus or whatever you call it, accomplishes the same thing from
&gt;another direction.
&gt;
&gt;--buy a new one (hah!)
&gt;

Hey Ken:

Yeah!

I've been thinkin' on all three.  I tried the PCB shift yesterday and it
didn't seem to negatively affect the way the thing runs.  There was no
misfire, but then there isn't most days.  Time will tell, but I think the
problem is fixed.

Thanx
