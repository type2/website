Mr Muir says that removing/replacing the fuel pump while the engine in still
in situ is not a good move................bugger........don't have workshop,
but have a new pump which I'd like to install myself.
The word PUMP implies that at any given time this unit is pressurised/under
pressure.....is there a valve between this pump and the tank....??
.........should I expect the balance of my tank to rush forward and greet me
?
Do I need to know a thing or two before unbolting it, and if so what ....??
As always....help is appreciated.
Garp
....To ponder till Friday.....who and where are the Type 2 drivers that
don't wave back.............and why ? ( should we call them &quot; Tourists &quot; ?)
