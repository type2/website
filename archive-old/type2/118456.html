Subject: Re: [T2] Friday Topic What I learned about driving in Snow!

Rae,
My bus currently has no fitted heat (I'm still need the heat-flap boxes plus
too busy working on power-train issues).  I added a 12V 300 watt heater like
the one here
http://cgi.lycos.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2452179289&amp;category=46094
and added a clear shower curtain behind the driver's seat to keep the heat
up by me.  The heater does a fair job of keeping the chill off the air down
to about freezing (0C/32F) with no other heat source.  The heater comers
with a good supply of heavy gauge wire and internal fuse.  I added jumpers
and just clip them directly to my battery (too heavy of a load for the fuse
panel) and run the wire via the engine deck-lid through the interior to the
heater, which I mounted on a plywood base between the front seats so it is
easily removable.  I got the heater off eBay for $30 US brand new, you can
also find them in marine supply stores as well.  I haven't found any
problems with my alternator keeping pace with the load, even with wipers and
lights running but make sure that you turn it off with the engine to avoid a
battery run-down test ;)

Cheers,
Drew
