Subject: valve adjustment, now backfires worse...why?

Fellow Listees and those that are smarter than I,

Today i got the rear bumper back on my bus and adjusted the valves. Went 
well but when i drove it it backfires everytime i change gears.

I have a crack in my muffler and it used to backfire occasionally but now it 
does it all the time....and all i did was adjust the valves, I promise.

I'm really curious for an answer to why it did this, I thought bacfiring it 
from exaust leaks and doesn't have anything to do with the valve adjustment.

I've got a 1600 single port with a worn out beetle muffler.

Thanks,

Daniel
