Subject: Re: [T2] wreck

Try contacting John Baker up in Ohio he just went through this and got a
good chunk for his totaled bus. Is John on this list? Frank ? Mark?
------------------------------------------------------

 Well, they're going to total my bus because of the relatively minor
front-end damage.  Anybody remember the link to sites that have blue book
values for old vehicles?  I Googled and didn't find it. He said I could buy
it back.  Looks like I'm going to get the drive shaft up the exhaust
treatment.  Thanks...KR
