Subject: RE: [T2] Need Alternator Tightning Bolt

Hi All,

I guess I should clarify. I had that bolt. It fell
off.  I tried to order a replacement (via Busdepot)
and found out it is now obsolete.  I was asking if
there is an after market fix that anyone might know of
or have come up with that I could use. I, at least,
need a temperary fix until I can get a new or used OM
bolt.  I would sure like my battery to be charging up!
 

Can I get a bolt at say a hardware store that will do
the trick and stay put? Any ideas? If so what should I
look for?

Rae

&gt; Bolt: They would have that also just ask them when
&gt; you order this..
