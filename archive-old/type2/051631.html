Subject: RE: [T2] Filler neck

Im not sure where this originated, I already deleted the original I think. 
Is this what you would need if you got gass spilling out from right about 
there whenever to fill your tank up and go around a corner with a little too 
much force?
I noticed it shooting out from there just the other day out of the side view 
mirrow after filling this new bus up all the way for the first time.

Best,

&gt;
&gt;Yes, this is the fuel filler neck for '74-79. Part number 211 201 119.  I
&gt;have had these for several months now, for about half the price: $19.95
&gt;(minus additional 5% listmember discount if part of a $50-plus order).
