Subject: [T2]what happened? broke down

ok first off i have pulled radio and all loose.... 
anything that was extra.... 
yanked relay out.. or better words took it out....  

ok before i even pulled plugs out i just wanted to see what it would do with battery in.. 

i have not tried cranking but knew that there shouldnt be no spark at all when connecting battery to cables.... 
i put the + on first and then just stuck the - to it and it is spraking big time more than i have ever seen... 
so i started pulling fuses at the panel under dash one by one.... 
and tried each time to add - cable and still same bad arse sparks... 

i went all the way down the line and got sparks afetr each one....but did add them back as i went also... 

i have fixed accelerator cable or got it jerry rigged again ....  

so i am figuring i have a bare wire somewheres maybe... 
how do i find it.... 
i checked starter and the wires are not melty looking or anything...? 
checked what i can see of the alternator wires and they are not melty looking...? 
i have even unplugged the regualtor wire plug and still get big spark when connecting - cable to battery...? 

ok so i am sure of a short maybe..? where what to do now..? 
i can see this isnt goign to be simple...~!~ 
any help is welcome here~!~ 
goign back out til i have a response and goign to get everything back down to bare minimun... all asscessories and such are getting pulled out and will be redone later on after problem is solved.... 
radio etc... 
even though they are dissconnected .... 
going to pull all fuses and see what happens when connecting - cable as well... 

peace and love 
chris
