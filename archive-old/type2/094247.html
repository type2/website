Subject: Re: [T2] 1975 Roter and Conpression Questions

&gt; 1) My 1975 bus has a 0231 181 012 distributor, this disy uses a speed
&gt; limiting rotor.  Do I need to use this expensive rotor or can I use another
&gt; cheaper one like 04 033.

You can use the cheaper one, I do.  I've seen the 5400rpm rev limiting 04016
for as little as $22 but you don't need it.  FYI, the 914 rotor is not the
same, it's 5800rpm.

&gt; 2) My motor has about 10,000 on it and I have not done a compression check!
&gt; My gage and the ones I see in the stores consist of a gage, hose and
&gt; threaded fitting.  Now the problem you can not thread into the head while
&gt; holding on to the fitting, I end up trying to twist the hose.  Is there a
&gt; gage out there that will clear the sheet metal?

Some gauges have a hose you can thread into the plug then connect to the
dial gauge with a quick release fitting.  Other types have a rubber end you
have to hold against the plug hole but they are a pain.
