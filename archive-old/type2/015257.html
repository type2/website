Greetings,


Last year at this time I had offered to obtain formal &quot;birth certificates&quot;
&gt;from the VW Museum in Wolfsburg. I will going to Wolfsburg again in June,
and as last year I will be willing to get &quot;birth certificates&quot; for anyone
who is interested. The birthcertificates are a more formal document than
the &quot;letter&quot; from VW, and contain much the same information. In fact, if
you want to see what a museum birth certificate looks like, email me and
I'll send you a JPEG picture of it.

Back to the story....


The museum will be able to provide the certificates for any VW except those
manufactured within the past year, and New Beetles....so regardless of
year, place of mfg., you can get a certificate for any VW (other than 1999
models AND New Beetles). 

Ordering info:

Please send a check for $8.00 for each certificate you want, plus:

Your Name
Address
VIN# of your VW


Send this to:
