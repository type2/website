Well, as your in-house economist, I feel compelled to field this one. :)

My first remark would be that parts availability is not an &quot;all or nothing&quot;
situation:

(1) Busses (or any car) can to some large extent be made to run with
non-stock parts. If one spends any time in the 3rd world, one would see how
ingenuity and &quot;McGyverism&quot; will make up for non-existing (or rather,
unaffordable) parts.

(2) Parts don't just disappear from the market from one day to the next.
However, as supply shifts over time, price increases. As prices increase,
ownership becomes more expensive and budget-motivated owners will look for
cheaper forms of transportation, thereby reducing demand. The reduced demand
means that scarcity is less stringent to those remaining in the market.
Furthermore, as the price for, say, left rear window seals, continues its
slow but inexorable ascent, it may become profitable for an aftermarket
supplier to reproduce the item.

(3) However, in the fairness-minded and price-sensitive VW community, prices
may not always freely adjust to market condition because a high price may be
perceived as gouging and would reflect negatively on the vendor (who values
reputation and continued business) or the listmember who values reputation
equally much. This means that prices will often not be high enough (sorry to
shock you) and the consequence is queuing and waiting a year or two for
availability and a little bit of luck. Consider tents for example: 5 years
ago it would have been considered immoral to sell a nice one for $300. Today
the &quot;immorality threshold&quot; has climbed to a little under $500, but you may
still spend a year or two looking. It's clearly a luxury item: if one only
cared about convenience and practicality as opposed to originality, one
would buy one of them new tents from Steve and if one cared about cost, one
would just buy a generic $100 tent, albeit one that doesn't attach to the
rain gutter.

To conclude, parts will not suddenly disappear, although cost of maintenance
will rise slowly but continuously. At this point in time however, it seems
to me that the upkeep of old veedubs is still relatively cheap compared to
other automotive alternatives. I wouldn't panic yet :)
