Subject: Re: [T2] OIL LEAKS

i would like to add a couple of things as well.....
*******************
&gt;	* Oil filter -- I currently have a leak here on my '76.
&gt;	  This type of leak should be easy to remedy - do an oil
&gt;	  change, and replace the filter, making sure to clean up
&gt;	  the sealing surface on the case, and get a nice film of
&gt;	  oil on the filter gasket before installing the new filter.
&gt;	  Make sure no old gasket material remains on the crank's
&gt;	  sealing surface.
&gt;
&gt;	* Oil screen fitting -- On Type 1 engines, I think there is
&gt;	  a gasket on the oil screen plate (someone please correct
&gt;	  me if I'm wrong; it's been about 12 years since I worked
&gt;	  on a Type 1 engine).  On the Type 4 engine, I think there's
&gt;	  just a single bolt that holds the oil screen; not sure if
&gt;	  there's a gasket on that (I've only had my Westy for a bit
&gt;	  over a month now, and haven't pulled mine off yet).
&gt;
&gt;	* My mechanic says that there's a seal at the oil cooler that
&gt;	  can go bad, and has suggested that this could be the source of
&gt;	  a minor leak that my '76 has.  It's apparently quite difficult
&gt;	  to get at this seal without pulling the engine if your engine
&gt;	  is Type 4.
&gt;
&gt;	* Front main seal -- You really don't want this one to go,
&gt;	  as I think it will soak your clutch with oil when it does.
&gt;
&gt;	* Filler neck -- PO of my '76 had a problem with a crack or a
&gt;	  hole in the filler neck (which is plastic), which was causing
&gt;	  a total hemorrhage of oil.
&gt;
&gt;	* Dipstick -- if it's not on tight, etc.  Make sure the dipstick
&gt;	  neck/hole/whatever doesn't have a crack in it (eek!).
&gt;       
         * dipstick boot ....

         *oil pump seal

         *  ring seal for flywheel

         *oil breather on top of engine in front of carb

         * oil pressure sender switch next to dizzy....
           rubber boot.. sometimes drips and looks as iff it comes from oil cooler ...

all i can add for now that i can think of..
