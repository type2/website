Subject: Re: Driving in the wind.....trip report (Long)

Hey there volks,

If your not into trip reports, hit the delete button now.

Happened back in September....

My story about driving in the wind starts like this. The &quot;green
monster&quot; had been totaled in a accident (other drivers fault). The
insurance company gave me some money and I got to keep my bus. Still
have it as a matter of fact.

I had some money saved because the green monster was gonna need body
work, lots of body work actually. It had classic New England Westy
Bus Rust. The rockers on both sides were missing for the most part,
but the sliding door track was still ok. If you pulled out the sink
cabinet behind the drivers seat you could see the ground though the
hole in the floor. It wasn't a big hole, but it was still a hole.
Yep, it was gonna be expensive bodywork to fix. She had some rust,
but really was a great bus. She didn't run when I had her flatbeded
home, but after some work she ran great. Overall she was a good
little camper, just a bit rusty, thats all. As Hans Solo said in Star
Wars 
&quot;It might not look like much but she's got it where it counts,
kid....
I've made a lot of special modifications myself...&quot;

When I first got the bus home, I did a tune up, brake job, starter,
repacked the cv's and changed the boots, put on new gas lines (Gas
tastes bad, ask me how I know). All the stuff you have to do after
rescueing a bus its been sitting somewhere for a couple of years. The
mechanical work was done. The vacuume leaks were fixed. I had just
bought a full set yokohama 356 supervan (18514D) tires, because the
ones that came with the bus couldn't be trusted anymore. This made
driving in the wind *much* easier. I drove for 100 miles on those
tires before the accident and the green monster was great in the
wind. Crosswinds were not a problem anymore. 

We'll anyways, Now I've got the insurance company's money and a
little of my own, and I *need* another bus. So I checked the internet
classifeds and post a few WTB ads and posted to the type2 list. I got
a few responses and had a couple of local leads to follow up on. I
like Baywindow Westy campers. I love the 2.0L, FI, aircooled motors.
I know solid lifters aren't hard to adjust but I like hydraulic
lifter motors. So I was on the lookout for a late 70's camper,
hopefully a '78 or 79. I got an email from someone on Martha's
Vineyard Island (off the coast of Massachusetts), about someone with
a 79 Westy deluxe FS on the island. Yep, the old &quot;guy who knows of a
guy&quot; story. Just because the bus was on an island, didn't stop me
from at least taking a look at it.

I make some phone calls to find out more about the camper and to
arrange a time to see it. I took the passenger ferry out of New
Bedford MA, and for $17 roundtrip I was off to the island to check
this camper out. I was reading &quot;The Art and Zen&quot; at the time which I
think was quite fitting. My brother said that I was the only person
he knew that was crazy enough to take a boat ride to check out a
vehicle. The ferry ride was great. The weather was great, I had a
good book, and was off on a &quot;I gotta buy a VW bus&quot; trip. 

The Camper was fantastic. Everything about the Westy that I learned
from a few phone calls was true. It was more than I wanted to spend
but the owner dropped his price a little, and it was a bus from out
west (Oregon), with no rust. (Ok, maybe just a little). Since it was
a 79, it has the square port heads (and exhaust). It had the motor I
was looking for and the FI was still in place. It's only minus's were
that it was missing the steering dampener, had bad tires (mixed 185
and 195 passenger tires), has &quot;the dent&quot; up front from the spare
tire, and needs a windshield. It also had some old accident damage
that was repaired. 2 accidents actually. One that was repaired the
right way, with metal (from a sage green donor bus), the other in the
rear corner was bondo-ed. [why is it that every other baywindow bus I
look at has a dented rear corner]. On the plus side it was mostly
complete and original (LE1M). It drove nice and tight, had new axles
(the whole thing, both sides, not just boots and cv's) a new poptop
seal, and the owner, Dave (from Martha's Vineyard's &quot;Bug &amp; Bus&quot;) had
done some other stuff to it.

Figured that this Westy was the only one I was gonna find that fit my
narrow seach criteia (and I am in New England). It's missing the
childs cot and camping stool, but had only 91,000 miles and still has
the original engine. I know I wouldn't find another one like it
unless I flew out west myself and had a bus trucked back home. This
bus is what they call &quot;dry and tight&quot;. I paid a deposit and got a
receipt.

Vehicle reservations are required to get a vehicle off the island. I
got a space on the last ferry off of the inland for that next Friday.
The 9:30pm ferry back home. Cost was 50 something for a bus (Cars are
$47, ask for the minivan rate, the oversized truck rate is more
expensive). I took the passenger ferry back to New Bedford and drove
the Ford home knowing that in a weeks time I would be driving a bus
again. I went into work that Monday and they ask if I bought the bus,
and I said &quot;Yep, I did, and I need to take friday off to go get it.&quot;

On Friday, I went to the bank, and then had my brother inlaw give me
a ride to New Bedford. The Schamonchi provides passenger only service
(bikes and small cargo are ok) to Marth's Vineyard. This time I only
needed a one-way ticket since I'd be driving the bus home. The
forecast called for rain, but the hour and a half trip wasn't that
rough. 

When I got to the island Dave picked me up at the ferry landing in
his very cool aircooled Vanagon (again). His Vanagon has three
quarters of the roof cut off. Martha's Vineyard Island is a tourist
attraction, so the Vanagon is like one of those station wagons on
TV's &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. Except Dave's Bus is painted up with zebra
strips and the &quot;Bug &amp; Bus&quot; logo. We drove back to his shop and I paid
Dave what I owed him. We filled out the title and bill of sale. It's
raining pretty good out while I put my plate from the 78 on my new
Bus. Dave mentions to be careful driving. The accident rate
skyrockets on the island when it's raining, 'cause the tourists don't
have anything else better to do went it rains. 

By this time it's about 3:00 and my boat doesn't leave till 9:30. I
stop by the ferry office to see if I can put the bus on &quot;stand-by&quot;
for an earlier trip back home. The next boat out was full but I was
told that if I came back later I might be able to get on the 7:30
boat. I drove around for a while to get used to driving a stick shift
again. The 78 westy is an automatic. I filled up the tank (even with
the high island gas prices), because the fuel guage doesn't work and
I have to drive 75 miles home. Stopped for a bananna split, which I
ate on the Westy's rear table. Drove to the Hospital's parking lot
and crashed out in the back to read some more of &quot;The Art and Zen&quot;.
It rained the whole time I was there.

When I got to the boat loading area, It was raining pretty hard. The
wipers and the heat work good so it wasn't that bad. I got a spot on
the 7:30 boat the ride wasn't bad. The weather did get worst as we
got closer to the mainland. I drove the 75 miles home in a bus with
mismatched tires (185 and 195 passenger), no steering dampener, in
the pouring rain and driving wind. It was an intense &quot;white knuckle
fever&quot; driving experience. I had to fight every gust of wind, to stay
in my lane on the highway. It was a very long drive, but a great Bus
bonding experience.

The next morning I swapped the almost new tires off the 78 and stole
the steering dampener too. The handling improvement was amazing. I
probably should have taken the tires and steering dampener with me
when I went to pick up the 79, but the idea never crossed my mind
until I was driving home. 

If you have the proper tires on your bus, and the front end, shocks,
and steering dampener are in good condition, Driving in the wind is a
breeze.
