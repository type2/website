Subject: Re: [T2] engine coughing

I would swap the coil.
Sounds pretty familiar.

[...]

&gt;      I have a 70 Westy that is my daily driver. I was on one of my normal 60
&gt; mile trips travelling b/n 55 &amp; 60 mph when she suddenly sputtered or
&gt; coughed. No matter what I did with the gas pedal, I couldn't get her to
&gt; respond. Then just as quickly as it happened, it stopped. When I got to my
&gt; destination, I checked the fuel filter, and it was loaded with garbage. I
&gt; replaced it and the ride home was problem free.
&gt;     Next day, I am on another 60+ mile trip travelling about 55-60 mph and
&gt; the same thing happens. I check the filter, all looks fine. I head back
&gt; towards home and at one point she won't go over 45 mph. I stop see nothing
&gt; out of the ordinary and decide to continue to my destination 5 miles away.
&gt; No problems the last 5 miles at city speeds 35-45 mph.
