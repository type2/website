Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Bath Removal

&gt;&gt;How do I go about removing the oil bath?

Do you have a type1 engine, if so it's easy. There are just some clip 
thingys at the bottom, then unplug the hose that goes to the oil filler, 
then take  the big hose thingy off the carb and pull it out. You might have 
to uncrew the clamp but mine just pops on and off.
