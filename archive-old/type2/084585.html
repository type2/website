&gt;List:  I have been trying to find some answers to a few questions that I have

&gt;in the event someone can help or can send me a link to help that I can read
&gt;without bothering the entire list:  Here is a question-The breather box on my
&gt;1800 that I am piecing together has a plastic diaphram valve of some kind on
&gt;top of it, what does this do and how?  I am considering using a breather box
&gt;without this valve but don't understand the consequence of doing so...if any.

Since there are no authoritative replies yet...
I've used both the one with the plastic piece on top and the one with just 
the metal tube coming out the side.  Can't tell any difference and I don't 
know what the plastic piece does, if anything.  Crankcase fumes come out of 
both, and are to be routed to the air cleaner box.
