&gt;I hope someone else will correct me if I'm mistaken, but I've never
&gt;heard of a Champagne Edition Westy.


To set the record correct, there is a Champagne Edition '78 and maybe '79
Westy, it is as Sally initially mentioned, white over brown, chrome bumpers,
Deluxe Westy stuff inside.  Features brown dash, delay wipers, bumper impact
strips.  The one I raffled for Charlie Ford, still shown at:

is a '78 Champagne Westy, and to boot I have a dealer give away (thanks to
Ric Golen) '78 atlas featuring a 1 page add detailing the Champagne Westy
with the &quot;Take the Bus&quot; slogan.
