Subject: Re: [T2] bee expert needed

Hello All   Just be careful about spraying around honey bee hives It takes 
very little to kill a whole hive of honey bees and they are not cheap to 
replace. Last time someone posted about bee in a bus it was all the BBB signs 
for bus by the bridge  later and have fun  Mark Dearing    also a honey bee 
keeper
