Subject: noisy fan
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Glen,
  I cut up an old inner tube and did a double wrap on
my fan. cuts the noise transmission down a lot as before it
was right up against the metal of the bus... as to the
switch thing. I run mine through the original relay for the
booster fan that was in the engine compartment so it is
either on or off on mine. But if you arent using that relay
then a multi speed switch would work.

&lt;snip&gt;  Works great!  Only thing is, 
it's a little
noisy, and I don't really need it blowing full blast all 
the time.  Can I
use some kind of fan switch with maybe 3 different 
settings?
