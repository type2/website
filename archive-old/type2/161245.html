Subject: 25th Annual NW Vintage VW Weekend!

The 25th Annual NW Vintage VW weekend is coming up in a week!  This is
the premier VW weekend in the Pacific NW.

Friday July 14th, starting at 5PM is the Burger Meat at University
Burgermaster (in the U-district, Seattle).  Great Burgers and hot VWs.
 Arrive early to get a good spot.

Satruday 9:00 am to 4 at Shoreline Community College is the Vintage VW
Show and Swap Meet. Admission is $7 per person with a $7 per car fee
to show your Volkswagen. Buses, Bugs, Ghias, Things - we even had Snow
Cats and K|belwagens! You never know who will show up. Maybe you'll
even see a Hebm|ller at this year's NW Vintage VW Meet.  If you plan
to show your VW, save time by pre-registering:

Also, to mark our 25th Vintage Meet we will be raffling off a week
long VW Westy camping trip for 2 to the Big Island of Hawaii.  We have
lots of other great raffle and door prizes!  Don't miss out!

Sunday, the Northwest VW Club is putting on a brand new show and swap
at Sandpoint Naval Station in Seattle!

Thanks guys... hope to see some TypeII listees out there!
