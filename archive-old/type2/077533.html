Subject: Re: [T2] Beating of a dead horse!

&gt; I can almost hear this dead horse neighing as I continue to beat it,
&gt; but: Timing setting on a 34pict3 - 009 set up to avoid hesitation.
&gt; 
&gt;  I just want a GENERAL CONSENSUS of where bus owners who run
&gt; this combo set their timing, 
&gt;
&gt; I just want to know what people who have this set up ACTUALLY do.
 
I run 30-32 degrees total advance -- no timing adjustment seemed to
improve things. Installing a pop rivet in the throttle plate however,
reduced the HUGE hesitation in my camper to a very slight, but
tolerable one. It might go away completely with a jet change and/or
accelerator pump adjustment. Take a look at Boston Bobs article on this
