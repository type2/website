Volks, 

This post has two purposes.  First it's a test of
the off-list filter :-)  Second, it's a follow-on
to the discussion of Jalousie windows and the word
origin.  It being Friday, it occured to me that
there are a couple of other part names I have
always been curious about:

Boudin tube - I know that a boudin tube is a
flexible tube to guide a cable.  There are several
on our buses, a couple for the heater cables, one
for the clutch cable, for the carb preheat, etc. 
but really, is it really named after the sausage? 
or is there a Mr Boudin ou there in it's history?

Pitman arm - the arm coming off the steering box
that connects to the drag link (which, oddly
enough does *not* wear any clothes at all:)  who
was Mr. Pitman?

Bendix spring - which keeps the starter pinion
from getting stuck in the flywheel after the
engine starts.  Named after the corporation?  or
is the corporation named after the sping or are
they both named after the same guy?

Who were these people?
