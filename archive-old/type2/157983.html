That's a pretty interesting bus, actually. It's a 1969 Euro Westy with the
small poptop, bench seat, and a full-length body pan. It came from the
factory with a gas heater (one is in a box somewhere in the camper). It's
also got smoothest sliding door action I've ever seen.

Thanks to the list, it's got a 1600 DP, 1971 tranny, a matching set of
wheels, and the camper interior that goes across the back of the seat. I
can't begin to thank all the folks who contributed in some way to getting
this baby back on the road.

Nikki
