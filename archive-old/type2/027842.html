Sometime back in the early 1970s, not long after my father bought our 
second-hand, British specification 1973 VW 1600 Type 2 Westfalia Continental 
in January 1975, we accidently left the pop-top up by mistake, as we left a 
campsite.

Fortunately, we discovered our mistake quite quickly, befoe any major damage 
was caused. However, I think it did cause slight distortion of the front of 
the pop-top, owing to the effects of windage.

A few years ago, I fitted a pair of 550mm long gas struts (i.e. gas springs) 
to our pop-top, originating from the rear hatch of a Volvo 300 series 
hatchback, in a local wrecker's yard.

One on the gas struts has an integral switch, which originally would have 
acivated the car's courtesy lights. I have wired it up to activate an 
ignition controlled warning light and/or buzzer; just in case on day, we 
ever again leave up the pop-top by mistake.

The gas struts now enable me to raise the pop-top easily using just one hand 
and the roof is virtually self supporting once it is half-way up. I wish I 
had performed the upgrade 25 years ago!

Regards.
