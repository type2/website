&gt; Terry,
Glad to hear that it works well for you.  Not sure what the climate  
is where you are, but in the southern part of Australia which is cold  
&amp; wet during winter ( read 6-7 months of the year) &amp; humid during the  
Summer, oil is one of the worst things to put in an automotive--no,  
actually any lock here.  Oil &amp; cold equal stuck wafers = no entry.   
We dread getting locks in at work that someone has 'oiled'.  The  
amount of work to clean them out &amp; make them reliable is often as  
much as non-genuine replacement.

Of course there was the woman who used kitchen cooking oil. . . .
&gt; I use plain old 30 weight oil in a thumb lever pumping oil can.
&gt; Works fine for me, and has for maybe 40 years or so.
&gt;
&gt; My locks always work fine.
&gt;
