Subject: Re: [T2] Department of how bad ...

&gt; I've never found a good one that was universal enough. Unless it's an absolute requirement because of location I find one of those rubber discs for removing the tops of pickle jars works very well.

I used to use one of those (old mousepads work too) until I got one of these:

It tightens as you turn the wrench to loosen the filter. I've used it
on a bunch of cars and haven't found one it won't work on yet, though
I suppose the big diesel filters might be too big for it. ;-)

The great thing about it is that you can use a long extension if you
need to for access. Or a universal or whatever is needed. Works
awesome.
