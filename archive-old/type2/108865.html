&gt; hydraulic lifter cases have the partially blocked &quot;well&quot;, on a solid case
&gt; the area is open to the main sump volume. this is one of the subtle
&gt; difference between solid and hydro cases, there are a few others as well,
&gt; like the oil pickup tube is a different length.

&gt; the easy way to check what kind of case you have is to look for the oil
&gt; pressure overflow valve on the side of the case just above the lifter
bores,
&gt; near # 1. there is a 14mm XZN screw head which is the cover for the valve.
&gt; if you have this, you have a solid lifter case. hydraulic cases do not
have
&gt; this valve.

I have a hydro case so I guess utill I pull the engine for the next rebuild
and split the case there is no way to make this cut out right?


&gt; as for the temp readings, i can verify that with a 914 sump plate setup
&gt; (with the short-nosed sender) in a hydraulic case, the oil temp readings
are
&gt; very &quot;lazy&quot;. the gauge still works, but it responds very slowly, taking a
&gt; very long time to reach max temperature, and also taking a very long time
to
&gt; go down if the temps go down. i have had the same sender setup in a solid
&gt; lift case and the gauge reacts much more rapidly, as there is much greater
&gt; oil flow in the region of the sender.


Without the cutout what would you suggest be the next best location for the
sender? Dipstick? I know they read to high but better that than to low. Do
you know if the dipstick sender reacts as quick as it should?
