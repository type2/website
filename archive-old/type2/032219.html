Subject: rubber mats around the seat bases in a '77
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.SOL.4.02A.9811241443430.15484-100000_at_insci14.ucsd_dot_edu&gt;

My van, like many of the 70s era busses I believe, has this thin rubber
mat that goes over the painted metal base upon which the seat sits.
another way to think about this part of the bus is that it is the interior
side of the front wheel wells.  However you call it, this rubber mat is
all used up, and looks awful, and shows off the break fluid resevoir and
other dirty spots of the bus, and I want to either replace that rubber, or
glue some odd scrap of carpet up in its place.  I saw that bus depot has
something that they call the 'seat pedestal cover'  sold in a pair of
right and left for $40.  Is this the thing I need?  is theirs pre-formed,
or are they just selling a scrap of rubber with the right texture for $40?
Any reviews from customers?  Are these made by WCM?  This and any other
pertinent information will be greatly appreciated.
