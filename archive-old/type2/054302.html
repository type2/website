Subject: Engine Pull

Hey Volks,

I'm in the middle of my first engine pull and have run into a little 
obstacle. I have the engine and trans almost seperated( I can see the 
flywheel)but can't seem to get it to move the last few inches so I can lower 
it. There is about 1&quot; between the rear apron and the oil filler tube and I 
didn't think I had to remove the tube from the sump, but I'm not sure there 
is gonna be enough room. Anyone have an tricks for getting them seperated??? 
I keep pulling on the case but it seems like It won't move any further. 
There isn't anything holding it back, just the trans shaft I think.

Thanks,

Jeff Mckenna
