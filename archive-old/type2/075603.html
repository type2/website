Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

&gt; That was the Bus depot that has listed in their online
&gt; catalog rebuilt pumps for ~$127.


Interesting...where did you find that?  We sell brand new fuel pumps for
$143 with listmember discount (our part # GFP301).  If there are rebuilt
ones somewhere on my site for $16 less, it's actually news to me. I've sure
never sold one...
