Subject: RE: [T2] Englishtown Show and Go...

&gt;Hey I was just wondering if anyone in the tristate area heard about 
&gt;this/was planning on &gt;attending, and if so, why I haven't really heard too 
&gt;much about it.

Its a show that has been going on for years, but for some reason this year 
has gotten a bit less publicity this year than past years.  More and more 
water cooled each year, but still a decent air cooled showing, especially if 
you're local.

I'll be there in my 79 Westy.  Feel free to drop a line if you're heading to 
the show.
