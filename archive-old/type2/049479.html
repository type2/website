Scott,

I've got factory cruise on my 77 westy.  It's not
installed and is still in the box.  I've never gotten
around to installing it and wondered if anyone else on
the list has this option ? and if so Does it work ?  I
don't want to go through the work of installing it,
only to find it's not functional ! 

It attaches on the steering column and has a unit that
mounts under the pedal area with Vacuum lines to the
brake booster !, I'm sure there is aftermarket items
that might work.
