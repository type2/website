&gt; 0.005 for the gap,  clearly way outside the Bentley range.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments on this 005 value?  Is it bad to have rings that are too tight?

Can't believe no-one's provided Jack with theory question by now.
Rings that are too tight will expand with heat and touch ends, then break.  The suggested gap is to protect you from that.  Staying at the low end of gap would be prefered.
Keep in mind Abraham Palmer's post from 11-5-98 that the worn cylinders may be tapered, so use the rings to compare gaps top to bottom.
