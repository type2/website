Subject: Re: Online tool source?

&gt;Best Source is Enco, unfortunately don't have a phone # or a catalog at
hand
&gt;and they probably don't have a WWW but you might check.

I was curious and found the ENCO web site at:
http://www_dot_use-enco_dot_com/index2.htm

I then found out that their so-cal warehouse is having an inventory
clearance sale which started today at 9:00am and will run through
Saturday (12/12/98) until 2pm.  I was even further suprised when I found
out that the place was a mile south of one of my vendors that I was
heading down to see this afternoon.  How could I keep myself away?

(2920 Redhill Ave, Costa Mesa CA)

I picked up a few items to add to the bunch
14 piece 1/2&quot; drive metric socket set with breaker bar   $12.00
1/2&quot; drive torque wrench $7.00
22 piece screwdriver/torx set $15.00
Dial Indicator $7.50
Magnetic stand/holder $7.50
rubber/plastic mallet (big one)   $1.50
Engine stand with wheels  $25.00
50 sheets of 400 wet/dry sandpaper $15.00

they were overflowing with drill bits, milling bits, colletts etc.  The
tools were generally from China/Taiwan.  Was told that most of the
really GOOD stuff has been moved already to AZ.  They had a parking lot
of milling machines and finally what started this thread was someone
looking for I believe micrometers or some other measuring device and
they had those from the $0.99 plastic ones to the $$$$ two foot high
biggies.

Bus content - look at the tools and one each one (except mallet) has a
predetermined use for my double cab that is in VERY slow state of
restoration.  If I waited till friday to post this, the so-cal'ers that
may want to drop by would miss it.
