&gt; I'm back home for spring break and I just started the bus up
&gt;and heard this terrible knocking noise! Now, I know there's oil in there, cuz
&gt;ain't no oil leak gonna do that! What's the deal??

Randy,

I'm assuming it wasn't making that noise when you parked it... (and you 
have a Type IV engine in there)

if it wasn't, then the noise you're hearing is probably one of the 
hydraulic lifters.  These can loose their pressure when the engine isn't 
run for a while.

let the engine run 5-10 minutes - hopefully the noise should get quieter 
and stop.  if it doesn't, try an additive/cleaner in your oil.

last time this happened to mine, I tried the cleaner to no avail, put 
straight oil back in, and it worked. - maybe the cleaner made the oil too 
thin to build up decent pressure in the lifter.

good luck

Dave.
