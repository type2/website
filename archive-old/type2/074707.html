Hey Glenn,
You might want to visit Organic Bob's place in Crescent Valley -between
Nelson and Castlegar. This guy has a quite a few bay windows and bugs.
He even has a few split screens, ghias and type 4's. The name of the
actual place is Organic Mechanix. He's been there since the 60's. The
local road runs right through the middle of his yard. It's off the
beaten track but well worth the trip. I make a pilgrimage to there from
Abbotsford at least once a year.

Subject: [T2] BC Canada Wreckers?

hi all,
I am going to be traveling from Calgary, AB to Vancouver and Whistler in
my
1977 Bus. If anyone knows any good wrecking yards along the way or near
by
please let me know. The trip is completely unplanned except for seeing
Burt
Neilson Band in Whistler on Monday and Oysterhead in Vancouver Tuesday
so if
anyone in those areas is interested in a trip to the wreckers or having
a
beer on Monday or Tuesday during the day let me know.
have a great weekend,
Glenn
