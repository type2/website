Subject: RE: [T2] Wheel painting

To redo rims, I start with purple degreaser, straight, gets off almost all of
the paint.  Just let it soak for a day or two and pressure wash.  I follow up
with muratic acid and water, 1 part acid to 4 parts water, overnight.  I then
spray with rust converter, then paint.  The intresting thing I have found is
that all of the bay rims I have done were marked opposite the valve stem hole,
so I believe they drilled opposite the greatest degree of inbalance to get the
rims closer to balance.

The closest to the factory silver i have been able to produce is clear over
aluminum. JT Beaufort, SC Running: 1. 62 404.1 Kompressor 2. 58 VW panel 3. 66
