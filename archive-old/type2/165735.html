Subject: Points dilemma

Hello,

Out on a cruise this last weekend and after pulling over and helping a
bug get running again my bus wouldn't start. It was running perfectly
until I pulled over and stopped. After an hour or so of futzing I got
it to start and drove it to the next exit, 1 mile away, pulled off and
thought. I realized that I hadn't looked at the points, so I popped
the dist cap and rotor, lo and behold the points had closed
completely. I don't know how I got it to start. I reset the points to
.016, checked the dwell, 50, and the timing, spot on. Drove merrily
another 125 miles where the bus lost all power while cruising at 60.
Pulled off the side of the road, popped the dist and the point rider
had actually snapped in half. I swapped in my replacement points and
drove it home. What would cause my points to close all the way and
then break? This is a 009, I know I know, on a 1600dp in my '71 Westy.
I am taking this up to Inuvik in June so I am looking towards
preventive maintenance.

Thanks for the insight,

Max
'71 Westy &quot;KK&quot;
