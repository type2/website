Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

I spent last summer in Bermuda working on a cruise ship.  Every  Friday night, a bunch of Harley's would pull up to the pier and hang  out.  Well, I thought they were Harely's.  They were Chinese  Harley look-alides.  You could buy one pretty well dressed for  $3,500.  Wonder how long before they find their way over  here.  On the other hand, Harely Davidson is exporting a bunch of  bikes to Asia, including China.  For the Neuvo-riche, no  doubt.  Wish they'd start making busses.  
  
  Hey, did anybody see that school bus race before the NASCAR race at  Watkins Glenn?  Pretty cool.  Love to take the Bopmobile  around it.  Cheers...KR

are pics of several Chinese vehicles that look quite like they bought a 
competitor's car, took it apart and reproduced most of the parts... 
Except that they seem to fair badly in crash tests. Also see the Russian 
Ural motorcycle... They did the same thing right before WWII. Still 
building them, and you can buy them here. I would had I the budget for a 
toy like that.

The race to the bottom of the economic ladder is what we are doing... 
Always shopping for the lowest prices... :-)  On the other hand you can 
pay the UAW and the big three management for cars that are still behind
