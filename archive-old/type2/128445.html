Subject: Plug Wire seals

I agree that the flimsy rubber seals that come on Bosch spark plug 
wires are useless.

About 6 years ago, I bought a set of Corvair plug wire seals.  These 
are really beefy big fat rubbery seals that lock into the hole on both 
sides of the tin.  They can be kind of hard to get in because I believe 
the VW tin has a slightly smaller hole than the Corvair, but once they 
are in you don't have to worry about them leaking any air.

I bought these out of a parts catalogue for Corvair enthusiasts, but I 
don't remember the name.  Mebbe one of the Corvair types on this list 
know the name of the catalogue?
