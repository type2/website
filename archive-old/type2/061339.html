I'm pretty excited, I got my 29 y/o heater running last night.  I took the heater back out of the bus, stuck it in a large vice at the auto hobby shop and took every moving switch and contact apart and cleaned them up.  filed and sanded the contacts.  Then I tested the fuel meter solenoid and it indeed worked.  The only reason I can figure why the solenoid didn't work before was either a loose contact or the temperature control switch up on the plenum.  The temp control switch has two wires coming off of it and the blade connectors on mine were quite loose.  I ended up bypassing mine as I repeatedly pulled it loose while trying to reinstall the firewall.  Choosing to control the temp with the on/off switch.  Metering the flow took a while, closing in on the correct setting, two minutes seems like a long time after the third and fourth time around.  When I was satisfied that I had the regulator set accurately, I reinstalled it and fired it up.  WOW!  More heat than I knew what !
to do with, I can't hold my hand directly over the hole.  and no smoke from under the bus!  
The only chores left are to pipe the heat out from under the back seat(75 west interior in my 69 dormobile) and come up with a new 24mm (?) fresh air intake hose for the heater.  Of course it was 35 degrees here this morning so it barely justified using the heater on the way to work.  
I was also wondering about fuel consumption, how the heater would affect the mpg.  Then I tried out some HS math, here's what I figured, someone please correct me if needed.  1 gal = 3.79litre.  Fuel rate in heater adjusted at approx. 10cc per minute.  I estimate it would take about 6.5hrs to burn a gal of gas with the heater. 
To anyone who has one of these heaters laying around, it's worth the effort to get it running.  Now I can store my propane tent heater!
Thanks again to Ron Van Ness for the advice and support.
