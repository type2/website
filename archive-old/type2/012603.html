Yo bussers:

I'm taking a much-needed sanity break March 4-8 at St. Joseph Peninsula state park, a remote park on Cape San Blas about 2 hours SW of Tallahassee.  
Although I plan to jealously guard the sanctity of my personal campsite (i.e., I ain't sharin'), I'd be tickled if any other considerate Bus People cared to hook up 
some time during that week (headed down Sunday and leaving Thursday).  I mainly plan to do absolutely nothing.

Park ranger is at (850) 227-1327; near-useless park website is at http://www_dot_dep.state.fl_dot_us/parks/District_1/stjoseph/.  I did a Google search for &quot;St. Joseph 
Peninsula State Park&quot; and came up with quite a few nice pix on various websites.

P-mail me if interested.
