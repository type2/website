Subject: Solar Power and Second Battery

Does anyone out there use a second battery with solar recharging for
12 volt and/or 120v power for lighting and appliances in their bus?
What components do you use for your setup? Does anyone have a wiring
diagram for such a system? How and where do folks mount the solar
panel?

I've seen various battery + inverter packs for jump starting and
emergency power use and I've checked out some solar panels for
recharging 12v batteries. They all look interesting and feasible for
some 12v appliances (like air circulating fan and lighting) and 120v
for low wattage stuff (like computers etc). I'm interested in other
folks setups, how they connect the components and how feasible they
are for use in a camper. I'm not using power tools or microwaves but
simple low power appliances.

Rick
