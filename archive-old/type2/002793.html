Just thought I'd pass on the expensive but ultimate fix for existing tanks:
I used an outfit called Gas Tank Renu USA/Swartz Creek/MI  810 635-9249.
They cut two holes in my extremely rusty tank, blast cleaned it inside and
out (though the outside looked brand new), welded the patches back in and
dunked it in a tank of some miracle plastic.  The metal is completely
encapsulated in this stuff that looks like a hard, shiny undercoating.
Lifetime guarantee.  They do a lot of farm equipment and restored vehicles
&gt;from what I can tell.  Mine cost $180, though their first price was $225.  I
know you can get a new tank for that, but not a rustproof one as far as I
know.

Do what you like, but PLEASE don't dump the gook out on the ground and burn
it there.  I'm no petro engineer, but I'll bet any Walmart garage would take
it in their recycling tank.
