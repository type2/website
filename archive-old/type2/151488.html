Subject: Re: [T2] Which SVDA Distributor????

&amp;gt; Currently, I have a 1971 1600 DP with the stock distributer.  These

&amp;gt; current, or just ignore the vacuum retard and retune the engine?

Is your distributor showing any other signs of wear?

You don't really need the retard function of the distributor. Retard  
is there for two reasons:

- improve emissions at idle
- as well as some trailing throttle conditions

You can usually rely on the vac advance only by retiming the engine  
to a suitable static advance based on the distributor and can that  
you have. I've yet to see an engine reconfigured this way that didn't  
run well but I haven't done exhaustive testing with every combination  
of carb and distributor. Someone with more experience should chime in  
to the contrary.

Even if you verify that the vacuum advance is currently working, a  
new vacuum can is always a good choice because I wonder when the  
other half of your vacuum can will fail while driving. A broken  
advance and/or retard can overheat an engine.

I think the new distributors are a good deal. Who knows for how long  
they are going to be available.

For a vacuum cans:

- dual vac cans are either NLA or cost more than a new distributor
- some single vac cans can be bought from Bus Depot
- Autozone sells a Wells RV1001 single vac can (Bosch) for $15 that  
is adaptable.

I think you should either swap the can out for a new single vacuum  
version or purchase a new SVDA from your favorite vendor.
