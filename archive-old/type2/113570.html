Subject: OEM hoses

Hold that. It could be 5.5mm for the carb side. I will check my inventory. 
I am sure I have the right size because I have the right stuff on my stock 
72 dual carb, with new OEM carbs and pump. Check with any vendors servicing 
parts for Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, OE VW.  I get fresh factory spec 
Continental OEM Made In Germany hose day in and day out from IMC and carry 
at least 7 sizes of 3 types. Cloth braided, high pressure smooth and 
diesel. Blue cloth braided brake fluid spec hose is also available. If you 
call 818-678-1200, they can tell you in your area who has it or can order 
it for you.

7mm from tank to pump then 5mm from pump to carb. Use a thin film of 
silicon paste to ease install.

&gt;Tim: I read in one of your posts to the Type II list that you have braided 
&gt;hose in a variety of ID sizes.
&gt;
&gt;I have recently been stumped when I buy fuel line hose that is quoted in 
&gt;the catalog to be 5mm ID and then find that it takes a lot of pushing to 
&gt;get it over the raised hump on a stock 1600 fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt;5mm seems too small and 7mm, the stuff I have for my FI engines, is too 
&gt;large. Is there a size in between these? If so, do you sell it mail order? 
&gt;I would like to buy a piece at least two meters long.

That would be 2x6=12+5 shipping is $17 for 2 meters in hand from me. Look 
for a Euro conscience FLAPS in your hood. Seek German Braided Hose on your 
fav search engine. In ten meter coils it runs me over $40 wholesale dollars 
plus shipping.
