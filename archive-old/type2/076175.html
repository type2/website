Subject: RE: [T2] RE: New Camper Interiors

&gt; I think it is a great idea, but I'm not sure how many bus owners
&gt; would pay  the cost.  I think you could get a complete running westy for
&gt; that amount of money.


I agree on both counts. Certainly this is not for everybody. It's not for a
person who wants a vintage Westy camper interior, as a used one in good
shape could be found for less money.  It's for someone who wants a more
modern camper setup, but with the looks and mechanicals of a bus - a
Vanagon/Eurovan Westy on the inside but a bus on the outside, so to speak.
