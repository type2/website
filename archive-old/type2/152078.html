&gt; You guys cracked me up. Thanks! I really needed that!

I know your pain,  have driven my 78 all over the East, still haven't made
the cross country trip, but haven't made that in anything else either.

&gt; This weekend is going to be the deal maker/breaker for me since I went

where ever it went,, I have some tools in the same place so if you find it
let me know

&gt; Not to worry, though. I still have another bus that MIGHT be able to

not sure I would take new anything on a long trip until I had at least
2500 miles or more on it...IMO...
  I prefer to take my bus, if the bus breaks down I have the knowledge to
probably fix it, and the AIRS list (that so far I have never needed) in
the glove box, my wifes S*turn breaks all I have is the dealer in the
phone book...

  that being said I have to drive from Baltimore to Dallas and back next
month and while I wish I was taking the bus I am taking my wifes car for
two reasons.  1.  her's has A/C and we are talking Dallas in the summer.
and 2. her's gets 34mpg and mine gets 19mpg  with gas prices what they are
that alone will save about $200 in gas.  so will miss my bus but can buy
it something nice with the gas money I save, but still will probably
wonder why those folks in Buses don't wave when I'm driving it, can't they
tell I've got a bus I'd rather be driving??
