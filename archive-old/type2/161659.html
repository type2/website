Subject: Re: [T2] Removing Tail Lights (78 Westy)

It's a pain, undo a couple of the nutsanbolts securing it, slide it to the 
side
and grunt a bit.
It's tight but it will go

J


 &gt; Also, on the right side, do I need to remove the black
 &gt; cylinder that connects to the air filter (not sure what this is...)
 &gt; Did anybody else have this trouble or have any tips?

Not a clue -- I was working on a '74.
