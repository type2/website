Subject: AVP engine, question about shipping

Hello list,

I am saving toward buying an AVP 1700cc engine for my
bus. The one I am looking at runs about $1090 right
out. The only expense that I am clueless about is
shipping. For those of you that have bought AVP
engines, how much did you pay in shipping? How did
they handle their core shipping? Did they pick it up
the the same time they droped off the rebuilt engine?
Will shipping the core cost extra or is that included
in the shipping charge they give you? I live in
Wilmington NC which is all the way across the country
so I expect that the shipping will be high but how
high? Can anyone help me out with a ball park figure?
Thanks! 
David Kelly
