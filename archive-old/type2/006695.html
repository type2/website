I don't recall seeing Griot's Garage mentioned on the List, but they carry
some really slick tools and equipment intended to greatly ease one man brake
work.

Much of what they offer is expensive, but there are still some reasonably
priced bits that would be useful around a VW bus/transporter.  Almost
everything they sell carries a lifetime guarantee, and the quality certainly
seems to be there.

Check out their brake system flushing/bleeding gear.  The catalog is online
at:
www.griotsgarage_dot_com

It's worth getting the printed catalog just to be able to drool over the
tools and accessories, and the text is both enlightening and entertaining.

FWIW.....
