Subject: '54 RHD Deluxe Bus Update

I've been working on the '54 here and there, now that the temperatures are
sane once again.  

I now have the passenger side piece that I had to fabricate to connect the
cargo-floor frame to the frame section of the beam fabricated and welded in,
and the frame rails under the floor gussetted and the center section (where
the heater tube goes thru) welded in.  Basically, the entire lower section
of the frame under the cargo floor is done, and the frame is done up to the
front beam and the the rear torsion tube.  I still have to rip the cargo
floor out and add the top supports.  I also have to fabricate the sections
on both sides of the frame between the torsion tube and the
&quot;transcontinental tube&quot; - the tube that connects the two frame rails and
goes under the transmission (a U-shaped channel on later busses) as well as
fabricating new frame pieces between the front beam to the area behind the
nose. And...

Once I have those 4 sections done, the frame will be complete, and I will be
able to begin work on the rest of the body.

I'll try to take some pix this weekend, then get them up on the web page...
