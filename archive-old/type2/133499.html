&gt; While we're on the subject of paint, it would be nice to hear from

&gt; How well? Well enough that other people have said admiring things about
&gt; the paint job, without any qualifications.

when I first got my bus I repainted it, with rattle cans, very high
quality rattle cans but still rattle cans.

when first painted it look quite sharp, now 12 years later it is in need
of a redo, and some new rust spots are taking hold..

used about $250 worth of rattle can paint. (I said it was quality paint,
about $6-8 a can or so)

&gt; Don't be modest.

moi?!
