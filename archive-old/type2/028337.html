Subject: Side Tents for $399!

I just obtained 4 Bus or Vanagon driveaway side tents from a supplier in
Germany, at a very good price of $399. That's about the going rate for used
tents, when you can even find them.  This is a really nice tent, too. It
looks great, and goes together much faster than many others I've seen.  In
fact one of my employees bought one of them as soon as he saw it, so now
we're down to 3.

The tent attaches to the bus via a pole that rests in the rain gutter and
clamps on using four small &quot;C-clamps.&quot;  This means that you don't need to
mount a track or any other permanent item to your vehicle; you just clamp it
on when using it, and remove the clamps when you're done. The clamps even
have rubber inserts so they won't scratch your paint.

The tent itself has a zippered door facing the sliding door of your van, so
when it's attached to the van you can easily walk between the van and the
tent.  If you drive away, you just zip the flap closed and you have a
freestanding tent.  On the other side of the tent (facing out) is a zippered
&quot;front door,&quot; and also a clear plastic window complete with curtains!  That
whole side of the tent can be rolled up to create somewhat of an awning.
The front of the tent (facing the front of the bus) has a screened window
with a roll-up cover. The tent is fairly large (footprint is about 12 feet
by 7 feet) and has no floor.  It is mostly gray, with some blue.  It
includes bags for the tent and the poles.

The part number is A0022.  There is a slightly fuzzy picture of the tent at
http://199.217.241.240/partsimages/awning2.JPG  .  No further listmember
discount will apply because my profit margin is very small. Once the three I
have left are gone, there will probably be a two month wait until I have
more.  You can order toll-free by part number at 1-888-819-DEPOT, or via the
website.
