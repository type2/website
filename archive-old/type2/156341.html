Subject: driver crank window glass install help

Hey All-

Desiree was unfortunately the victim of vandalism the other night.  Three of her windows were shattered.  I have managed to replace two, but I am having difficulty with the driver crank window glass.

Is there a way to install the crank glass on a '70 bay without taking out the vent wing post?  I'm afraid if I force it too much, I'll shatter the new [old really] piece of glass.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
