Subject: Re: [T2] Stewart Warner Gas Heater vs. Eberspacher

Oooooh, I can feel the heat already and with a DoubleCab, I'll cook my toes
off! Oh Joy!!!

Now to find the missing pieces... I'll let everyone know what is missing and
hopefully someone will have the parts. If anyone is interested in the
Stewart Warner, it is very hidden on ebay not under heaters and has yet to
have a bid. A steal at $125 bucks.

Or item # 8026035546

Looks complete and in pretty good condition.

&gt; the BA4 is stock in the VW 411/412 I have one in my bus and it puts out
&gt; so much heat that I have totally disconected my stock heating system and
&gt; use the BA4 for all heat....and I ski and get into some pretty cold
&gt; situations.  it can be finiky to  get working right but then it works
&gt; fine.
&gt; 
&gt; don't know anything about the SW so can't compare em...
