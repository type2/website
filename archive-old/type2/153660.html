Subject: Re: [T2] spray on bed liner on undercarriage?

inhibitor, would that be great or what?
&gt;
&gt; Load up a garden sprayer with bar and chain oil (chainsaw stuff) and give 
&gt; the belly of your van a thorough shot before every winter season. Long 
&gt; winters with lots of sand/salt may require repeat applications.
&gt;
&gt; Cheap and effective, easily applied (yeah, right. Wear disposable bunny 
&gt; suit).

IMO - it just does not make sense to spray the underside of your own 
vehicles. I used bar and chain oil once and I'm sure it does a good job and 
it is pretty cheap .. likely under $25.00 - but it makes a real mess where 
ever you apply it and unless you have a hoist - it is really tough to get 
right under the bus and spray the stuff with whatever kinda wand you use. I 
say - just take your bus to Krown or another good shop and let them do it.
