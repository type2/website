Orginal snip
&gt; It looks like someone removed the EGR filter

Response snip
&gt;It is not good, but it is hardly uncommon.  The 
engine runs fine, without it, but a bit hotter
and a bit less efficiently. ...

Mighty Dworkster and All,

Anyone else have problems with this comment? 
I've never seen a highly efficient race engine
with a pipe from the exhaust to the air cleaner. 


My understanding is that this is one of the first
things done in the name of emissions control (to
appease nonappeasable treehuggers) that
ultimately, along with bumper/airbag
requirements, that led to the demise of aircooled
VW's.  

I'm sure the exhaust gasses being rerouted to the
cylinders make the exhaust gasses cooler, hence
more complete combustion (?) with less pollution,
but I'm not sure that corresponds to the engine
running cooler, especially given the lower power
and requirements to run an engine harder, etc.

Or maybe I'm off my wagon again?
