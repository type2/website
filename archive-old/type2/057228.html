ok, all you slackards and slugabeds ... it's Friday!! and to start it off
and rattle your braincells a little bit, here's some old stuff from the
50's!! (still applies, though ...)


Song of the Wiper

Flip Flop, Flip Flop,
  Never falter, never stop,
Through mist and mud and sleet and snow
  On and on and on I go,
The same by night and the smame by day,
Chucking the raindrops out of the way;
  Call it an easy job but, Lord,
A chap gets stiff and a chap gets bored
With the same old swish and same old slop,
  Flip Flop, Flip Flop.

Flip Flop, Flip Flop,
  Waiting for the rain to stop;
Everything else has some sort of a range,
The gear box gets no end of a change,
  Carburettors choke and cough,
The lights go on and the lights go off,
  Tyres can go to soft from hard,
Even the spark can advance and retard,
  But I go on until I drop,
Flip Flop, Flip Flop.

If I might indulge in a skip and a hop
  Such as Flip Flop, Flipperty Flop,
Or even the tiniest ghost of a skip
  Like Flop Flop, or Flip Flip,
That at least wold something be
  To break this damned monotony,
But never a chance, I keep on turning,
Gears gone dry and windings burning,
  Until my armature goes pop,
Flip Flop, Flip Flop.
