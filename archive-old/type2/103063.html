Subject: Re: [T2] fuel cutoff solenoid

Thanks - now I know what you are talking about. I skipped a couple 
important details when i read the message.

Valid concerns you have I think.

I just realized that I've got to have TWO cutoff solenoids since I have a 
fuel injection engine - one for the supply and one for the return. Guess I 
will have to turn off the supply first, idle a second and then turn off the 
return line solenoid.


&gt;It was just a reference in my earlier post. On my '77 2L dual carb I have
&gt;fitted a fuel pressure gauge at the carb, and the fuel cut off at the tank.
&gt;What I have noticed when turning off, the fuel pressure will rise from
&gt;3.5psi up to 12psi over 1-2min, and drop to 0 over another 3-4min. I guess
&gt;the fuel locked in the lines between the cut off and the float needle is
&gt;locked in as it heats up the pressure rises.
&gt;The big problem of course this extra pressure (3-4 times what it is intended
&gt;to see) makes the chance of a fuel line bursting/popping off MUCH more
&gt;likely, just the thing I'm trying to avoid.
