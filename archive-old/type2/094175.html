Hi Volks,

I can verify Jamie on this; although his bus isn't quick; it does sound
&quot;good&quot; and seems to run smoothly with the pack up to 65 MPH. But it's a
**major** PITA if you get caught behind him on a long hill.  AMHIK. ;^)

I think this says a lot for the advantages of a well balanced engine; having
equalized performance on all 4 cylinders and (presumably) well balanced
reciprocating mass has helped keep this engine going long past where a
lesser collection of parts would have packed it in.

Happy trails,

-&gt; then I got out the leak down tester,,, and got 60% on all 4,,,, all ring
-&gt; leakage.
-&gt; 
-&gt; I can still maintain 65 mph after about 5 miles to get up to that speed.
-&gt; 
-&gt; What do you think,, should I continue to drive it,, and wait til the
-rings 
-&gt; roll up and disintegrate??
-&gt; 
-&gt; I have put about 4000 miles on the temporary engine,, fully loaded to
-almost 
-&gt; 6000lbs GVW  and it still performs well enough to keep up to my travel
-&gt; buddies!
-&gt; 
-&gt; I do have to use 3 gear on hills now,, and one nasty second gear hill -
-&gt;near Round Hill Va.
