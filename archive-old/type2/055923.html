A friend just called me to let me know that he was visiting his in-laws and
low and behold a neighbor has a 64 bus that has been sitting behind the house
for many  many years. Anyway he says its in rough shape but i still want to go
check it out. To the extent its to-far-gone are there any particularly rare
parts that i should look to salvage??

first, is it really too far gone?  The thing to look at is the body, as
anything mechanical can be fixed, and usually a bus that has been sitting has
the bits, unless it's been parted out. except often the motor is missing.    

Look at the main frame underneath- they should be solid.  The ones than run
the length of the bus.   Don't worry if the outriggers to the jack point are
rusted- they can be replaced. 
Is it just some dents, dirt, and been a storage shed with a little rust on the
floor, 
or is it mushed, parted out, and has trees growing through it?

If you can, look at the M code tag on the metal partition  behind the
passenger seat and post the info.
