Actually, the weight on the &quot;outside&quot; tires will increase as the weight 
on the &quot;inside&quot; tires decreases through the roll, to a limit. Then as the 
roll continues, the weight on the outside tires will decrease.

But this depends on an operational definition of &quot;weight.&quot; That is, as 
measured by a scale.

Wow, I'm sorry I got into this one.
