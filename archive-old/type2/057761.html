&gt; &gt;&quot;remove the pins&quot; and they just slide out. Well they don't tell you
where
&gt; &gt;they are or how to get them out! Now I have found them, but can't
get them
&gt; &gt;out with breaking them.

If you do end up breaking them, don't sweat it too much.  The little
spring leaves that go between the levers and their holders will hold
the levers in place very nicely.  I intentionally left the pins out,
as it is such a pain to remove them without damage.
