Subject: The '77 westy FI 1/2tank/full tank, I found something need help!!!

Hi Scott,
    I've been following your posts to the type 2 list as I'm curious as to
what will fix your problem.  I also have a 77 (ol'Red) and have some
information to answer questions in your last post.  Hope this helps you.
    The charcoal canister has three connections.  On the right side of it
there is a larger diameter hose that goes to the air cleaner box and a
smaller diameter hose that comes directly from one leg of the tee that
connects the fuel tank vents.  That tee is the one located behind the fan
that you mention in your post.  The connection on the left side of the
charcoal canister is of a larger diameter and the other end of that hose
connects to the engine fan housing.  There is a short, metal tube sticking
out of the left, upper, rear corner of the fan housing and it points to the
left side of the bus.  Look just forward and outboard of your ignition coil.
I do not have a de-accel unit so I don't know how that will change things.
    As for that electrical connector, it sounds as if you are talking about
the oil pressure sending switch.  That is the only electrical unit I can
think of under the #3 intake tube that would screw into the engine.  Is your
oil pressure idiot light working correctly?


Good luck

Paul
