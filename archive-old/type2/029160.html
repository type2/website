H&amp;R did mine a couple years ago for $60 and I couldn't be happier with the
product or the service.  They turned mine around quick.

I'm dealing with the same thing on my 71.  Checking the archives, Dave

I contacted them and was quoted $60 + Tax($4.95) + Shipping/COD for a 71
booster.

Pretty cheap compared to the ~$300 elsewhere.

Good Luck.
