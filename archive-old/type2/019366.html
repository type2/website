denise,

What's to respond? Inspect it! Driving on a bad wheel bearing can be very
costly (ask me how I know). The bearing may really overheat and weld the
race to the spindle (a HUGE ordeal to replace).

Just jack up that wheel and give it a spin and a shake. When you spin it you
should not hear a growling from the bearing. You may hear some other parts
rubbing (this may be your problem, I hope so), but the deep growling of the
bearing is very distinctive. Then hold the top and bottom of the tire pulling
them alternately back and forth, and see if it wobbles up and down. If you
feel any movement at all the bearings need adjusting (a very simple
procedure).

Good luck.

&gt; well, since i didn't get any responses to my last post, i'll try again.,
&gt; i am getting a squeak from my front right wheel when
&gt; coasting, or driving in 1st or 2nd gear.
&gt; i'm guessing it's a wheel bearing, but i could use  2nd opinion. it
&gt; seems to stop when i hit the brake. it also takes a bit of driving to
&gt; get it to happen.
