Subject: RE: [T2] BIG news - NEW Front Axle Beams!!!

I just happen to be looking at the Classic Volkswagen Restoration catalog (
Schofield ) and they offer front axles for 69-79 at 225.00 (I guess that is
in Euro?). They also sometimes have 68 front axles. I am not sure if this is
a used part or what, just thought I would pass along the info.

&gt; This is big news.
&gt; The best news is the price. I can offer the first 4 units to listmembers
for
&gt; $299.95 (first come, first serve).  After that, it will be $349.95. This
is
&gt; less than many junkyards have been charging for used beams.  I have
several
&gt; units available now for immediate shipment, but (while I have high hopes)
I
&gt; cannot yet be sure of uninterrupted supply in the future.
