The only thing that I can think of was that I used some anti seize compound on
the threads of the plugs.  It is not on the electrode.  maybe I should go get
a fresh set of plugs and put them in?

thanks for the replies!

That could be it...It's not just the electrode, the plug grounds to the case
through the threads...You might just have a non-cunducting anti-seize on
the threads...
