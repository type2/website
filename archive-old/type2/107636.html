The e-brake on your bus is pretty easy to troubleshoot technically
speaking, but it is a notoriously dirty job and requires you to
travel the length of the bus from front to back in the tracking of
the system.

What I usually do is this:
pull the lever back and away from the dash.  Does the lever travel
toward you easily? or is there some resistance?
When you turn the release on the lever, does it relieve any tension?
can you hear it or feel it release?
The way a brake feels is almost as important in the diagnosis of the
trouble as is the more readily consequential moving while parked
(freaky OMG we're gonna die) sensation you get when you don't want
it to move.

So the brake release handle connects to the black lever inside the
dash, this lever is highly visible as you see it move forward toward
you when you pull on the brake inside the cab.  The lever proceeds
from the dash, down through the cab floor and terminates under the
bus.  Prepare to get dirty here...

Crawl under the bus.  Grab a 10mm socket or phillips head
screwdriver (depending on what you've got on your bus) and remove
all of the bolts/screws from the forward pan.  Wear eye protection
as it will drop debris on you when you remove it.  With the pan off
you will be able to see where the lever from the cab terminates
under the bus.  This lever will connect to a cable.  This cable will
in turn connect to a junction bracket that connects to two other
cables.  These two other cables will have tension adjusters on them.
These two other cables will guide into covered brake lines which
then proceed down the length of the bus until they terminate at the
back of the rear brake drums, respectively.  (Two lines, one for
each drum).

  Often the viewing of the junction point of the cables in the
forward portion of the bus will let you know if there is even
tension on both cables.  Typically a cable can become disconnected,
broken, or just improperly adjusted, all three of these troubles
will show slack in one of these cables which are visible at the
junction bracket in the front of the bus.

Once these cables are in the brake lines, you will need to actually
get into the brake drum in order to view where they terminate at the
rear of the bus.

 The removal of these drums is a FAQ unto themselves.  Typically it
will require several methods of attitude adjustment (i.e. 4 foot
long cheater bars, 36 mm or 46 mm socket depending on year, ratchet
or special tools, large quantities of beer, friends with forearms
like Popeye the sailor man, etc.. etc..) in order to get the
retaining nut off.  So I will skip the brake drum removal for now
and pretend that you have already got the PITA drum off of the bus.
Somebody posted an excellant process for removing the drums just
last week.  If you don't have it I bet I can dig it up and forward
it to you.

At any rate, the brake line terminates at the back of the plate.
The brake cable then extends from the line through the brake plate
and terminates at a lever which is part of the brake shoe mechanism.
Seriously look at your cables.  Cables can fray and stretch or the
terminating ends that connect to the brake shoe levers can break(no
pun intended).

If you find that your cables appear to be intact, then start looking
at your brake shoes and the inside of your drum.  Is the interior of
your drum gouged at all?  Often if a PO neglected the brakes the
shoes may have completely worn down and the steel plates that hold
the shoes will still try to apply pressure to the inside of the drum
when braking and gouge the drum interior.  Dunno if you can get
these turned or not, I've always just replaced the drums when I have
found this trouble.

The good news is that if you have gotten this far in your
troubleshooting, and have your drums off, then you might as well put
new brake shoes on.  They are cheap cheap cheap.  My set cost me
something like $17.00 at napa for the rear drums.

Just remember that the brake lines for the e-brake are not the same
as the hydraulic lines that run from the master brake cylinder.
Also note that the rear drums on the 76 bus DO require proper
adjustment of the brake shoes.  76 was not a year that included
auto-calibrating brake shoes for the drums.  The shoes that sit in
the rear drums on that year have an access hole on the back of the
plate that allow for visibility and also adjustment access.  However
it should be noted that several manuals specifically advise that you
remove the drum to _properly_ adjust the shoes.  The reason is that
what is visible of the shoe through the brake plate may not be the
part of the shoe that is actually wearing on the interior of the
drum.
