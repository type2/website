Subject: Re: [T2] Size of bolt  that holds timing scale in place

[...]

6 x 1.0 x around 15mm long.


&gt; Thanks to advice from several listees I was able to acquire the timing scale
&gt; (and the fan inlet screen) for my '78 westy.  The local dealer had them.  I
&gt; was shocked and amazed they would have anything for an ACVW.
&gt; 
&gt; The question now is the size of bolt that holds these things in place??
