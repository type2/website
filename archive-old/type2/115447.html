Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Filters??

&quot;
My 1970 westy w/ 1776 has a full flow oil filter installed. I've always used 
a
Bosch oil Filter #72174. That's what was on there when I got it, so that's
what I've always used. This filter is for a 88-91 Jetta. Here's my question:
     I'm having a tough time locating one in town. The place I usually get 
the
from is out and won;t have any for a while. Can I use a filter from my FLAPS
(Fram, etc.) vs. the Bosch filter or am I asking for trouble.

BTW I'm not trying to start some long mean thread on oil filter types here. 
A
yes or no answer would do it for me.&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------

I've used Purolator and Fram with no ill-effects.  Get the extraguard if you 
buy the Fram.
It has the antidrainback valve.  I prefer to use Mann and Mahle if I can 
find them.  Hengst is another element I use in my Passat.  Happy hunting.
