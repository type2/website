Subject: Re: [T2] chains

Wow, Bussy, I didn't know there was so much to know about snow  chains!   Thanks for that.  I think a set of the cable  type would suffice for my needs.  I think this post needs to go on  Ratwell's site.  Great information.  And thanks to all of the  other responders to my question.  Didn't have time to answer them  all.   The general consensus seems to be that if used  correctly, they are safe, reliable, and don't damage the tires.   Headed to Wally World...KR

Busahaulic &lt;busahaulic01_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; wrote:  I always carry chains (in winter!) Depending on
conditions... I usually use real chain-type chains
with  lugs on the cross-chains. If the road is icy but
not very much snow, I'll use cable chains. If really
treacherous, I put the heavy chains on the traction
tires and a cable chain on my outside front for
steering.

You must pre-fit your chains to your tires. You don't
want a bunch of extra hanging out to bang your body.
It's best to mark where they hook, as when it's
freezing cold and yer lying there half under yer bus,
it isn't the time to experiment.

I pre-fit the chains and trim them to only one extra
link inside and out. If I don't want to trim them, I
use nylon tye-wraps to tie back the extra links. I
always use &quot;rubber band&quot; tensioners - they help take
up the slack there is (there always is!)

When I apply the chains, I first clear snow away all
around the tire. Next, I drape the chain over the
tire, off-centered to where I will be able to reach
the end from underneath the back side.

How should the chain be placed on the tire? Clench
your fist. Holding it clenched, look at your
fingernails. That is how the links that connect the
crosschain to the side chain shoud look when applied -
the open part faces out otherwise it cuts into your
tire!

There is usually a simple hook and a compound hook.
The simple hook goes inside. You have the chain draped
over the tire, a little more toward the inside than
the outside. Lay down on the ground and hug your tire,
grabbing the two ends of the inside chain - one in
each hand. Hook them together and quit hugging your
tire - someone may be watching!

Obviously, the inside hook will be at the very bottom
of the tire. Pulling a little here and a little there,
pull the outside chain as far toward you as possible -
by working a little here and there you'll be amazed at
how much slack you can work out! Done correctly, you
will have pulled enough slack to just about hook the
outside. Most compound hooks have a clamping mechanism
that hinges back over itself and then a slide-link
holds it in locked shut. You can often hook the
furthermost part of the hook (incorrectly, but we'll
fix that later) into a link. Put your rubber band on
(usually five attachment points) as well centered as
you can.

Warm up if you have time. Now do the same to the other
tire. If you approached from the front side on the
first tire, you will approach from the back side on
the second tire (and vice versa.)

Once you have the temporary hook and the rubber band
on, drive about 3 revolutions and stop. The rubber
band will have pulled enough slack for the next step.
Now go out and remove the rubber band, hook the
compound hook as far as you can from the end link and
secure it. Put the rubber band back on. Same for other
side.

If you have one or two links hanging free, you can
hook one of the rubber band hooks on the end link and
it will be fine. If three or more, you need to use
either baling wire or nylon tye wraps to secure it.
Heavy duty tye wraps work fine. Baling wire hardens
and breaks and the ends go into your tire and give you
a flat!

If you can, after a mile or so, get out and check
them. If you drop a chain off the outside of a tire,
you have lost a chain. If you drop a chain off the
inside of a tire, you have lost your brakes and CV
joint and quite possibly a lot more. Don't take any
chances!

If your chains are in perfect condition and they are
perfectly snug, 35mph is the absolute maximum you
should ever drive on them. When you get to bare
pavement, every revolution of your tires is one less
revolution you'll have when you need the chains! It
beats them apart very quickly. Cable chains can go a
bit faster, but when they come off or come apart, they
can do as much damage as the heavy chains.

If conditions are really bad and you're having trouble
steering also, a tight fitting cable chain on one
front wheel will suffice. With cables, always apply so
that the pigtails (end pieces sticking out) are
trailing as the tire goes in a normal direction. Those
pigtails need to be tied securely also. A couple
lighter-duty tye wraps on each one work fine. Be sure
you have dykes to cut those tye wraps when time comes
to drop the chains.

If you did everything correctly, when it's time to
drop the chains, try to get to where the hook is about
4 o'clock position as you face the tire. Unhook the
tensioner (rubber band) and unhook the compound hook
on the outside. Work slack over the tire toward the
inside and reach around with your right hand and slip
the link out of the hook. Now work the long end over
the top of the tire and hook the compound hook again,
chainlying on the ground outward from the tire. Do
same for other side. Drive forward a few inches, go
back and pick up your chains, holding them by the
locked compound hook.
Lift them high and slam them against each other a few
times to get most of the stuff off them.

Still hanging on to that hooked-together point, lay
them in a heap in a bucket or such, either side by
side or one atop the other. When you get home, take
them out and hang them to drain and dry. If you always
leave that compound hook connected, they will never be
tangled! Inspect them before putting them back in the
car for next time.

If you are traveling any distance or a lot of mountain
driving, always carry at least one spare.

When you change tires, check the chain fit.

On Bussy, I cannot run chains with the mag wheels as
there is NO fender clearance! I mount my snow tires on
stock rims. Remember that in really tough conditions,
narrower tires are better. Not an opinion - just a
fact (that I like to disagree with myself, but a
fact's a fact! I like slightly wider tread, myself!)
Be sure to pre-fit! You may need to run strap-type or
cable chains just because of a lack of fender
clearance.

You can run slightly reduced air pressure to allow
more tread to contact the road but only while your
speeds are below 35mph. On your range C tires,
something in the neighborhood of high twenties to low
thirties will work well. Multi-ply sidewall tires do
not like being run underinflated and if done for any
extended time, it can lead to ply separation and
ultimately a blowout somewhere off in the future.

Those of you who drive a lot in snow, please add your
own advice. If you disagree with any parts of what I
said, please explain why so I can learn also! I spent
several winters chaining up more than my share of a
fleet of school buses, years before that of trucks and
jeeps, but I'm sure willing to learn more! -BaH
