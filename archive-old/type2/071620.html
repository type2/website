Subject: 71 Westy Questions

Hi all,

I drove my new purchase home today, and have a question or two I couldn't 
find answered in the archives. So here goes.

The pop-top does not close completely (lay flat) on the passenger's side. 
From about the sink vent back, it sits up about 1.5 inches above where it 
should. Even with the straps fastened down inside, it still sticks up. Could 
this have to do with the hinges? 

Also, how hard is it for one person to raise the top? This one I can't do 
alone. I get it part way up and it seems really wobbly and unsteady. The 
brackets where the hinges attach to the roof are somewhat loose--is that whyI 
had a 77 Westy before, and that style roof was a breeze to open. I pushed 
part way and it kind of sprung open. Are the earlier ones more difficult, or 
do I have something else going on?

One last thing--before I drove off I checked the fuel lines--and the metal 
line that passes through the firewall had no grommet. I wrapped it in duct 
tape as a temporary solution to get me home, but now I want a proper fix. 
First--should I replace the metal line if it does not seem to be leaking? 
Second--I would guess I have to detach the line to slip a grommet around it 
anyhow? Just trying to stay safe. 

Other than that, so far so good. Drove her home today (Allentown PA to 
Basking Ridge, NJ).

I'm sure I'll have more questions as life with the bus continues...

Sue
