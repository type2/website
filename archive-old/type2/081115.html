Subject: [T2] '69 linen closet and water tank


&gt; Greetings,
&gt; In what seems like a never ending search for a
&gt; within-driving-distance linen closet for my '69 Westy,
&gt; I got to thinking about exactly what other year's
&gt; linen closet would fit my bus. Would it be only 68-71
&gt; or should I expand my search to other years? Would any
&gt; other years fit...earlier or later? And if anybody out
&gt; there has a spare water holding tank they would like
&gt; to sell, I'm all over it. I'm currently using an empty
&gt; 2 1/2 gallon Poland Spring water container...it works
&gt; OK but I'd like the real deal. The real pain is that I
&gt; have to pull out the sink unit to fill it.  Thanks for
&gt; any help.
&gt; 
&gt; Doug
