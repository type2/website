Subject: Cooling an AC VW engine(Kind of long)

All,

There has been some discussion about the cooling of an aircooled vw
engine.  The VW/Porsche engineers spent many years designing, and
perfecting the cooling system of the aircooled engine.  While Porsche
went the way of an oil cooled system, VW stayed the aircooled path. 
The basic principles are that the fan, be it a type I or type IV
engine pushes air that is drawn in from above the engine compartment,
where it is cooler, over the cylinders, and heads.  The airflow was
regulated, and directed such that the flow surrounded these
components.  The vains, and flaps in the fan housing serves this
purpose.  Not only do the thermostat, and flaps provide quicker warmup
times, but they slow, and direct the airflow so that the underside of
the cylinders receive cooling air.  Without this regulating of the
flow, you have cavitation under the cylinders.  This leaves stale air
under the cylinders that can be heated to extreme temperatures.  This
only occurs at high fan rpm's, which coincidently occurs at highway
speeds.

The action of the fan creates a low pressure situation in a well
sealed engine compartment, which increases the amount of air sucked in
through the vents.  This is a GOOD THING(tm).  When you introduce a
poorly sealed, or non-sealed engine compartment, the low pressure area
still exists, but inaddition to the cool air that is drawn in through
the vents, warm air that the fan just worked to exhaust out the bottom
of the engine, is now sucked in, at both slow speeds, and fast speeds.
This is NOT GOOD(tm).

While in areas where the temps never really get cold, the lack of a
thermostat will not dramatically reduce engine life, it will none the
less reduce it.  However without regulated/directed airflow over the
critical components (heads/cylinders) IN ADDITION to a proper air/fuel
mixture, engine life will be dramatically reduced.  

As was said before, VW produced millions of engines.  These engines
were designed to operate in all temperatures, including the extremes
of the arctic, and the desert.  They would not have included these
pieces if the engineers did not insist that they would help in
longevity.  As with any automotive company, their reputation is built
on the reliability of their product.  If these components did not
help, then VW could have saved millions of dollars over the years by
not putting them on in the first place.

Just my $.02

Cheers,

David
