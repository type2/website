&lt;&lt; I have a good idea for a &quot;model&quot; ACVW engine -- how about one of those 
that 
sits out behind somebody's barn &quot;just waiting to be rebuilt when I have the

blown-up 1600SP from their '69 Westy for free or for real cheap.  It would 
make a great 1:1 scale plaything for your kids, &gt;&gt;

I'm looking for free or real cheap 911 engine to build a 1:1 scale plaything
just in case I ever have kids... ;-)
