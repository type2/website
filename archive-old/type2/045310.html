&gt;Does anyone know of a Car Restoration for Dummies type book or any book
&gt;that would be helpful to the novice.

&gt;BTW I already have the hayes, chiltons, bently and keep to vw alive books.

No one with that kind of stable could be a dummy. They just don't earn that
much. Dummies cannot restore vehicles which is why such a book doesn't
exist. The only books needed are the two of significance you have, the
Bentley and Haynes. (toss the Chilton).

Do check out the Eastwood Co. for any further books or tools needed.

There are a variety of skills necessary and all require rote effort to
develop. A tenacious character is not optional. If you want a better than
middlin' result, better than middlin' skill is required. So do hire out the
body and paint work unless you will spend a lot of hours practicing and
testing procedures and techniques before you weld up a mess or the paint
runs foul. Or hire those skills you lack.

Then take it all apart, clean and prep, send it off to the body/paint
werks, then put it all back together with fixed or new parts.

The 73 Camper should have a budget of 5 to 10 grand, plus your several
hundreds to thousands of hours, that is, for a truly complete 'ground up'
restoration. With the camper, the 855T and the R/90, you will be well
covered for transportation needs. Sell the Mustang to fund the resto.
