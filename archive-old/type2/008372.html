Like apples are not all the same, Mercedes and their wheels are not all 
the same. You can't group them in the same class. Not all used 15&quot; 
wheels even though the body was the same. Some classes changed body 
style and wheel size. All have different offset. Mercedes wheels ALWAYS 
has the MB star on the backside along with the MB part # 124 401 13 02, 
the exact wheel size i.e. 7Jx15 H2, and the offset i.e. ET 41. Knockoff 
and aftermarket wheels will not have this info on it.  ET = rim offset ( 
dimension from rim center to wheel contact surface in mm). I do not know 
what bus wheel offset is. 

&gt;The best fit for buses are Mercedes. These years are a good fit,
&gt;with both bolt pattern and hub hole size being correct, but it said
&gt;nothing about offset, although someone else here has testified as to
&gt;offset being right, I believe:

For what you list, here is the model # and wheel size in 15&quot;. USA 
version cars! 

&gt;190,220,260,280,300, &amp; C-Class         '84-'98         15x7

190 (201 body): 
201.024/028/029
6J x 15 H2 ET49 [15 hole] up to 1988
6 1/2J x 15 H2 ET44 [8 hole] up to 1988
7Jx15 H2 ET35  as of 1989
Sportline + 201.034/036  7Jx15 H2 ET44 [15 hole] 7Jx15 H2 ET41 [8 hole]

260 +300 (124 body):
88-93
124.026/028/030/032/090/230/290  6 1/2Jx15 H2 ET48 [15 hole]  6 1/2Jx15 
H2 ET44 [8 hole]
94 124.032/052 sport suspension 7Jx15 H2 ET41

C class (202 body):
202.022/028  7Jx15 H2 ET37 

&gt;420,560SEL,580SEL                      '86-'91         15x7

6 1/2 Jx15 H2 ET21.5
 
&gt;E-Class                                        '93-'98         15x6.5
E class was 124 body, see above. E class is also 210 body starting in 
1996, except these came with 16&quot; wheels.

&gt;  These charts also said that the 225 tire should have a 7&quot; rim,
&gt;although a 6.5 would do, and that a 205 was best with a 6.5&quot;, but a 7&quot;
&gt;would do also. Seems like I recall long ago reading somewhere that a
&gt;wider rim (that is, wider than what was required for a given tire size)
&gt;actually gives better sidewall support. Narrower, like trying to run
&gt;205's on a stock VW 5.5&quot; rim gives bad sidewall support.
