Subject: RE: [T2] converting rear seat to bed!

&gt; yes, a company called z-products used to make the
&gt; bed conversion kits. I thought the bus depot had one 
&gt; as well, but I can't find it on their website right now.


The Z-products Z-Bed hinge kit converted a stock rear seat into a sofabed,
at a price of about $400. However the manufacturer went out of business a
number of years ago, so only used ones are to be found. The hinge kit we
sell (for $99) requires you to fashion your own sofabed out of plywood,
foam, and upholstery (just as the Westfalia sofabed is constructed) rather
than using the stock bus bed. Although this of course involves more work,
the resulting bed can be more comfortable, as unlike a VW back seat it will
be totally flat when made into a bed.
