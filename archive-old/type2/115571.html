Subject: distributor confussion

  Hey folks.  I own a 69 bus with 71 DP engine.  For a while I was running 
an 009 distributor but finally saved my money to purchase a vac advance.  I 
found one at a well reputed parts house and ordered it.  It was Bosch part 
#0 231 167 055. When it arrived today, I noticed that the last three #s were 
not 055, but 070.  In searching the archives I found that this is common for 
replacement on a 72 beetle with the same engine set up.  My question is 
this, is this the same as the 055?  Also, if so, will the cap and rotor from 
the 009 fit it?  Thanks for your time!
