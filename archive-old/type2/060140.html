Subject: Price on child's cot?

List,
Has anyone purchased a child's cot for a late model westy either from the list or elsewhere?  If so, whadjya give for it?  I'm trying to get a ballpark on what mine is worth. Of course, its in really good shape like all other unused, missing accessories for these things.
--Thanx volks.
