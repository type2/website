Subject: Re: Creaks and Groans - Front end

If the shocks LOOK old, replace them! Its a relatively cheap way to make
sure yer wheels stay where they're supposed to: on the pavement. Might
solve your clunking noise, too. I have a similar clunking noise from the
front on bumps; it comes from my steering box I suspect, since the box was
the unfortunate contact  point between Bus,  pothole and speedbump... all
in rapid succession. Houston roads...
I also have some clicking at braking - I have a slightly warped rotor; more
importantly, my right caliper  fails to retract all the way. Need to work
on that (since the garage charged me $50 and things changed not a whit -
ok, DRIVER's side is fine, but rh is worse, so I guess things DID change!).
Rotors can be hard to find and $$$$$ in good shape; calipers are fun, but
not impossible to do yourself I've found. Read the manuals, buy the parts
*before* the car won't stop but you need to drive to the FLAPS for a part,
and make a weekend of it. And while you've got the front end apart, you
will thank yourself later if you check/replace bearings, shocks,  torsion
bar seals, grease torsion bars, test that sideways-shock thingy on the
steering gear, brake hoses, tightness of screws, bolts, etc... Not only
will you know one more part of your Bus with intimacy and confidence that
you know how it works (and can fix it on the road!), but the damn thing
will drive MUCH better.
