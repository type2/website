Subject: Re: [T2] Adding wiring under bus

In my daughter's 75 bus:

I ran a heavy (4 gauge) wire and a wire with 5 cables inside through a
split tube you buy to protect cables- all from Home Depot.  This was fed
from engine compartment through a hole drilled into the floor just left
of the ECU (behind air cleaner) and then through a body girder into
holes found in the other beams and worked to the front.  Keeps it all
neat.  For now I hooked up the heavy wire from the battery to a 4 outlet
fusebox that will feed 2 lighter outlets, an inverter, and a fan. The 5
wire gets a oil temp gauge and oil pressure gauge; maybe a tach also.
