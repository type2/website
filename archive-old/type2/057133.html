Hello again, fellow V-Dubbers!

    I just installed two new brake switches in my '72 Camper, bled all four
brakes, and now I have this clicking sound upon braking.   Brakes seem to
feel okay, but the sound doesn't inspire my confidence.  Near as I can tell
it comes from underneath me (near the vacuum assist)?   Hard to tell without
bungee cording myself underneath and letting my wife drive me around
stomping on the brakes!   The clicking only starts when I apply the brakes,
and then slows to a stop as the bus stops.

Any ideas?
