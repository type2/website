Subject: Re: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

&gt; &gt;Throw out bearing($19.95)
&gt; &gt;Pilot Bearing($3.95)
 &gt;Flywheel ($159.95)
 &gt;Rear main seal($9.95)
 &gt;Clutch Disc($?where?)
 &gt;Pressure Plate($?where?)

I would've hope that somebody would have suggested that she get the flywheel 
'resurfaced', not necessarily 'replaced'.  Ouch!  Unless the flywheel is 
severely heat-damaged(discolored, cracked), I would think a deglazing and 
roughening would do the trick.
