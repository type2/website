&gt; Ok.  So I remove the right head cover, a half a cup

&gt; The second from the front, the number 1 exhaust?,
&gt; has a pretty big gap.  Lots of rock in the rocker. 
&gt; The other parts all looked in there correct places. 
&gt; I didn't do anything else under there as I am parked
&gt; in the street plus I can't say I'd really know what
&gt; to do.  So I put the cover back on.

&gt; And btw, this is on a 74 type 4 1800 dual carb

Engine needs to come out and be taken down completely
as metal shavings have gotten into all the parts they
shouldn't oughta be in! Replacement engine or rebuild.
Going to a T1 probably won't save you any money as it
is not a simple bolt-in item. It needs to be adapted
to the fittings of the original T4. Others can tell
you the particulars. T1 parts are cheaper and more
commonly available. If you're a thousand miles from
home and it goes t-up on you, you'd likely find
somebody to loan you an engine to get home! On the
other hand, the bottom end on the T4 motors is very
much stronger and more suited to heavy buses. If your
body is questionable, maybe looking for a replacement
bus is the way to go. If you do, however, keep in mind
that they're all 30 years old and you might be
stepping into a deeper pit than the one you're in, or
you might come out very well. I can't say as I
recommend VW buses for people who cannot do their own
mechanical work unless they are real enthusiasts and
have enough money to pay someone to properly keep it
up.

You could consider a conversion to a 3TC Toyota or a
Subaru, like I did... but then, you'd still need to do
the work yourself, it's a lot more complicated, and
you'd spend ten times what a replacement T4 engine
would cost you. But you'd only have to do it once -
ever! -BaH
