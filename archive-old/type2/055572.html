When you pull the e-brake, only ONE of the brake shoes is pulled.  So if
the other shoe isn't adjusted properly via the adjusting star, the whole
assemble will shift and not put enough pressure against the drum to hold
your bus.  

Clear as mud, right?  In simpler terms (and as Roy stated), properly
adjusting the rear brakes via the adjusting stars will enable your
e-brake to work right.  The only other possible cause of your e-brake
not holding when the cables are tight (and balanced) is grease-soaked
brake shoes which require immediate replacement.

A point you should consider is that you may want to loosen the equalizer
bar on the brake cables before adjusting the rear brakes via the
adjusting stars.

Have fun!
