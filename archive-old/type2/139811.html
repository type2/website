&gt; I talked with an air cooled mechanic (mostly Porsche and a few Beetles in

&gt; What IS the desired reading I should expect him to dial in my '78 Federal FI
&gt; stick Westy ??

according to the VW service manual (orange book) engine oil temps at 122F,
intake air sensor warmed to 68F, adjust manual tranny to 900 RPM plus or
minus 50,  adjust CO to 1.1  +-0.9 vol %

only thing I can find so far
