&gt;Air conditioning a little VW bus is about the silliest excess-baggage idea
&gt;I've seen cross
&gt;this list since I subscribed. There. I said it and I'm glad.

Mike, I realize you have your own opinion, and that is what this list is
for.  And what is really neat is in the bus community, everyone does there
own thing.  But one persons opion may not be anothers and so everyone does
there own thing.

You may not have camped much in 100 deree heat with 90 percent humidity
where as soon as you step outside, you are soaked!!  You may also be young.
When I was 30 years younger, a bunch of things didn't bother me as they do
now.  The guys and gals from Texas were the first ones to show up at Busses
No Where Near the Arch campout over labor day with little ac units on their
busses.  Last year, I bet almost half the busses there in the 110 degree
heat with humidity you could cut with a knife had little ac units!!

Most campgrounds now have 'lectricity.  Heck some even have phone and cable
if you want to pay for it.  A small electric ac unit makes no noise at all
and keeps you from sleeping on wet sheets or sticking to the seats.  I also
have a 3 year old and I know I sleep better when she sleeps better.

Heck, anything that extends the driving season of a bus (ac and gas
heaters) is a good thing.

Are you saying if we don't like our busses the way the are, we should sell
them?  Pretty narrow minded thinking.  Go to a bus campout some time and
point out the totally stock bus with no extras!!

If you ever come up to a Midwest summer campout, look me up, I'll let you
sleep in the top bed of my westy on a hot summers night and see if you have
a different opinion in the morning!!
