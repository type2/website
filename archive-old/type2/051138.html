Subject: [T2] Bugs on the Pier 2001 a S.P.A.C.E. Odyssey

Just a reminder to all Florida listees and anyone visiting the Weekend of
February 3rd , that the show is on January 3rd from 6-10 p.m. on the pier in
downtown St. Petersburg. For show info go to www.inertia_dot_org/space/ My
neighbor in his '67 split and I will be leaving Orlando around 1 p.m. and
taking I-4 to Tampa. If you want to hook up, drop me a line, and we can
arrange to meet somewhere on route.
