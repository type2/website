Subject: paint it yourself? (well, yes and no)

Anybody who has been on this list (and the unified Vanagon list) more than a
month knows that I have covered the ends of the spectrum on this issue.

'67 Westy (resto project) $multi~thou for 22 months of body and paint work.
Grrrr...!

'57 Single cab (desert rust experimental test station) $15.00 for 45 minutes
of red iron oxide primer. Kinda masked it off with a ragged hunk of card
board as I worked in a near gale force wind.

The truck is a &lt;generally&gt; dependable daily driver for Mrs. VanBondo and can
be parked next to any Lexus and get plenty of room. The &quot;precious&quot; '67
garage princess has yet to leave the property or be driven ten feet. We have
intentions of keeping, driving, and enjoying, both. =)

 Oh heck, VanBondo says &quot;to Hell with it&quot;, lets export all of them to Japan
and forget about it all together. What do y'all think? =)
