Generous and Faithfull Listees

I have a '77 2.0 FI motor, the front exhaust pipe and heat exchanger
have significant leaks
in them. I also have a '76 2.0 FI motor which I could pull the front
exhaust pipe and heat
exchanger from and replace the one on my '77. My question is are these
two items
interchangable from '76 to '77?
