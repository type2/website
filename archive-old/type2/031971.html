&gt; How do you clean up the EGR, with a solvent?? 

I've tried a number of things. Generally it's just the EGR valve and the 
tube running inside the plenum that need cleaning. The crud is a 
combination of carbon deposits and rusty crud. I find just mechanical 
scraping and scrubbing with various picks works pretty well on the EGR 
valve. Or oven cleaner. Or brake cleaner (toxic shit, that). Or hot water 
and soap and elbow grease. 

The tube in the plenum needs to be rotorootered out with something like a 
piece of old accelerator cable attached to a slow speed power drill. It's 
a pisser, but sometimes you have to remove the plenum from the engine and 
work through the holes where the intake manifolds go to get at the holes 
in the tube from the other side. Again, elbow grease and persistence 
works best. I haven't found the need for solvents. 

It's such a PITA that every time I do it I consider just passing smog 
then immediately disconnecting the thing until next time, to keep it 
clean. But I tend to leave it running since it is stock and is supposed 
to have benefits for air and engine, as Ken Hooper recently reminded the 
list.

Bus runs pretty well with or without it and I would have to measure more 
carefully than I have to detect differences in performance, fuel economy, 
or operating temp. If anyone has real data on this (like gas analyzer 
results with the thing online and offline) I'd love to see it!
