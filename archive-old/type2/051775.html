Yes there is some very minor differences. The Vanagon engine does not have
the breather box on the top of the engine, it just has that part enclosed
and a tube coming out. It also has different size bolt holes in the rear for
the rear mount. The dipstick tube is on the filler neck of the 79, its in
the case of the Vanagon. The heads are both square posts, not so if you were
talking 72-78. With minor adapting both engines can be swapped. There may be
other external things that need swapping, but that is easy. If you want, I
have type cases from 72-82 if you would like to see the differences.

Is there a difference in a 1979 T2 engine and an engine in a 1980 Vanagon ?
