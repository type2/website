Subject: RE: [T2] Front Brake Pads

&gt; Now I have always had a slight problem with the front 
&gt; brake pads squealing.  I chalked it up to the cheap 
&gt; pads I was using. Surely these new, OEM Pagid pads 
&gt; have a softer, quieter compound.  Well after installing 
&gt; everything the front brakes squeaked WORSE than 
&gt; before! 


Brake squeal is typically caused by the vibration of some component in
your braking system. The choice of compound used on the pad surface will
primarily impact wear rate, stopping power, and brake dust generation. 

Pagid is my preference in an OE pad, although I have also had good luck
with Mintex (which is owned by the same company as Pagid), PBR, Jurid,
and ATE. At $25 a set the price is not much more expensive than
generics. What you do get, besides quality, is consistency. You noted
that your last set of cheapo pads stopped the bus as well as the Pagids
did. But if you bought six sets of generic pads, they might come from
six different factories and have six different levels of performance.
You don't know what will be in that box. If you bought six sets of
Pagids they'd all be the same (and good). Since stopping the bus is a
safety issue, I don't think twice about paying an extra $10 for this
level of security when I put brakes on my Westy.
