&gt; However, I did see an early bay inside plastic handle that had the screw
&gt; 'offset' in the handle.  That is, it was not drilled right through the
&gt; center of the handle.  The handle had the same look as others until I popped
&gt; the little cap off.

That's 211 843 642. The later one with the centered screw has an A on the
end of the part number.

The earlier ones still crack so they're no bargain find.
