and speaking of megasquirt (you just *knew* I'd have to reply, huh), I 
just got a wb02 sensor and my newfound tunability is AMAZING!  I can 
dial in an exact air/fuel ratio and it holds it right there.  I'm amazed 
how much power I was missing out on.

Soon I'll be running the ignition through the MS, too ;)

later,
Mike
