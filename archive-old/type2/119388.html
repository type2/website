Subject: Steering looseness

Hi Everyone,

The steering on my bus is fairly loose, the steering wheel turns ~ 4-5 inches
before the wheels actually start turning.
Now, I had all four ball-joints replaced (as they really needed replacing). And
following the &quot;Idiot's Guide&quot; determined that the swing lever arm is not moving
up and down while the steering wheel is turned left to right.
So, my questions are: 

Before adjusting the steering box is there anything else I should be doing? 
Should I also replace the steering dampner? How does one know if it's shot?
Is there anything else that would make the steering so loose?


TIA,
Harry
