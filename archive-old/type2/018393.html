&gt; Running a 2.0L with 10W-40 dino oil, I noticed that as the oil temp.

       No loss of oil pressure with those sort of leaks.

&gt; Also, I noticed there was a lot of grime around the oil pump/oil filler
&gt; point of contact b/t the block and the cooling shroud.  Should this be
&gt; cleaner than it looks.  I intend to pull the cooling shround and
&gt; investigate when I get the time...

       Serious leaks usually mark their spot on the ground -- sometimes it's
helpful to spread a newspaper on the ground underneat. A little bit of
seepage here and there is no sweat. Maybe you could tighten the bolts there,
but you'd probably have to remove the rear support beam to do it.
