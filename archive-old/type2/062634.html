Subject: MOT failure :-(

Hi all,

Just failed my MOT, am about to fit rear shocks &amp; new exhaust
to my '62 bus with the help of my trusty boyfriend.

Also need to get the brake lights to work.

Oh well, nothing major wrong -- no welding etc.

Will probably post again this evening begging for tips on
how to do the above :-)
