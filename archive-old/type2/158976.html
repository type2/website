Subject: Re: [T2] Need source for charcoal filter hoses

Thanks Jim,

I'm also going to have the fuel tank compartment open and want to 
replace the hoses in there. I don't have the tall vent tubing in the 
side air intakes. As I recall, there is just some plumbing inside the 
fuel tank compartment that makes its way out to the canister. Do you 
know what the size or part number is for the hoses inside the fuel tank 
compartment?

&gt; The correct hose to use is 12mm ID Breather Hose, fuel and oil 
&gt; resistant.  VW Part Number N 020 374 1, many vendors on the list carry 
&gt; it.  In a quick fix, 1/2&quot; PCV Hose is acceptable to use as it's oil 
&gt; and fuel resistant and can be found at any FLAPS.

&gt;     Listee's,
&gt;     It's time to replace the charcoal filter hoses on my 71. The
&gt;     charcoal filter has one hose going to the right side of the fan
&gt;     shroud, one to the oil bath air filter and one coming thru the
&gt;     firewall from the gas tank. (there is also another hose from the
&gt;     oil filler to the air filter). It looks like they are all the same
&gt;     size. The tube on the side of the fan shroud that the hose slips
&gt;     over measures .508 in. or about 13mm. What is a source for a good
&gt;     quality hose for this application? - especially the hose from the
&gt;     gas tank which has to tolerate raw gas fumes.
&gt;     Sincere Thanks,
&gt;     Bill Moon
