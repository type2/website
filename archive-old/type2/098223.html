Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure Drop

[...]
&gt; the temp will get say 240 and the PSI drops to 20 +.
&gt;  What do I need to
&gt; troubleshoot?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The 240 is a problem, could be a cooling air
problem, such as improper placment of cooling tin,or
as drastic as a clogged oil cooler, had one a while
back with a rat's nest in it(at oil cooler),but your
oil pressure looks good, it is normal for the pressure
to drop as the temp goes up. Phil
