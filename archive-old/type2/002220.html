For me, the fix was to wedge a small piece of foam between the seal and
the roof.  First I tried loosening the bolts and pushing down on the rack
while I tightened them.  I'm not sure which method worked, but I don't
recall seeing a piece of foam wedged up there (maybe I wedged it
real good and hidden).

Good luck!

&gt; This past summer I replaced the luggage rack &quot;not really a seal&quot; seal on
my
&gt; 76 Westy and now it does the same thing at speeds around 70-75 or with a
&gt; headwind.  The old seal appeared to be an actual seal and it had trapped a
&gt; lot of trash around the inside bottom edge of the luggage rack portion of
&gt; the pop top.  The new &quot;not really a seal&quot; seal only covers the edge of the
&gt; fiberglass and it doesn't trap debris but it howls like a lovesick coyote.
&gt; I've tried adjusting the top to eliminate the gap and the bolts are tight,
&gt; but no luck.  Like Todd I would like some suggestions.  Thanks.

&gt; Subject: [T2] roof vibrating
&gt;
&gt; This past summer
&gt; while driving my 74 Westy from Seattle to Oklahoma, when the winds would
hit
&gt; it from just the right side the front part of my Fiberglass roof would
start
&gt; howling vibrating the fiberglass until I would either slow down or the
wind
&gt; would change direction. Now I did take it off this past spring, clean it
all
&gt; out under there and put a new seal around it. Any ideas on how to stop
this
&gt; deaffing vibration? I tried tightening the bolts in the front but am
scared
&gt; to over tighten them. Any ideas will be considered this spring.......Cant
&gt; wait to go camping here in Oklahoma.
