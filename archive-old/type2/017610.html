&gt; 
&gt; Hey Volks!
&gt; I am in need of a steering box for my 71' westy...

We bought a NEW steering box(they were somewhat hard to find down here
in southern California) from:

Wolfgang International
1117 Parkview Ave
Redding, CA  96001

(916) 246-4264

Ran about $650.00 US or so, plus shipping if'n I remember right. 
Expensive, but sure improved handling. With new heavier shocks no more
&quot;floats like a boat&quot; down the freeway.

Also, no matter where you get one from, Wolfgang recommended this
concoction to fill the box with, instead of the heavy oil as is
recommended in the repair books' specs lists.  

The concotion is:

--One container of moly-lithium grease(about 1 pound--15 or 16 oz on the
container)
--STP fuel additive

Mix the STP with the moly-lithium grease till the grease will JUST flow
when you tilt the mixing container.  When we had the box installed I
gave the mixture to the mechanics with a zip lock bag.  They were able
to pour the grease mixture into the bag, lock it, cut a corner off the
bag squirt it into the steering box as if they were using a pastry tube.

I was told that the above stuff was the nastiest, stringiest stuff to
mix, and wear my oldest rotten clothing and mix it outdoors, away from
everything, cause it gets all over.  So, what did I do?  I mixed it in
the house, wearing regular street clothes, on the kitchen table on old
newspaper, in the grease container itself and had nary a glop spilled. 
You choose your mixing methods, depending on how rambunctious your
stirring style is!

I guess this stuff is supposed to flow around to grease the box's guts,
but is too thick to leak past the seals.  Is working for us!
