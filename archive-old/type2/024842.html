Hi, my name is Matt, and I live in Northern California.  I was lucky enough 
for my first car to be a 1967 Karmann Ghia, and I love it.  However I have 
always wanted a type 2, specifically a camping bus.  I am getting married 
this march, and from my soon to be father in law i will be recieving a 68 
bus.  He has a friend who was going to donate it, but figures if a VW guy 
gets it, the bus might be better off.  I have never seen the bus in real 
life, and am not actually sure if i have ever seen on like it.  I have a 
small description, and if anybody has any pictures of one similar or could 
give me a better description I would much apriciate it.  I'm not to worried 
about its condition, I think it has always been a california bus, and so 
shouldn't have much problem with rust.  I am also quite a VW machanic from 
restoring my 67' ghia, a 67' bug, a 69' bug, and my latest project a 68' 
Baja.  I also plan on making what camping equipment it has a little nicer.  I 
don't really want to restore it to the way it was new, i want to make it 
better than new.  Anyways any help or oppinions i could get i would 
appricate.  The description fallows:

..a 1968 VW bubble top.  It's not the
type with the pop-up camper top, this one has the taller hard top.  You
can stand upright in the center of the bus without bending over (for
average size people!).  The back seat can convert to a bed, it has an
ice box (not to be confused with a frig), and has a pump for water, lots
of storage space and the rather unique added feature of a tent that can
be attached to the sliding door.  Right now, the poor thing hasn't been
run in a long time but it has a oil cooler, a dead new battery and a
flat tire.  There is no heating or cooling and no sound system (not even
a radio but I have one I was going to put in it, just never got around
to it). I just paid the tags on it in September, the insurance is paid up, it 
should
run if somebody wants to give it some &quot;TLC&quot;.

Thanks, Matt

(I just need to know what a bubble top is?  Never even heard of it.)
