Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters 

I would highly recommend that anyone with a camper should buy and install a
marine or &quot;deep cycle&quot; battery if you wish to run lights and accessories.
These are available everywhere that batteries are sold. They cost a little
more, but they last a long, long time, and they are actually suitable for
boats, where you might be running accessories for a long period of time, and
still need enough to crank an engine. No one wants to get stalled on the
high seas without enough amps to start their engine or operate a radio. Some
of the big, high compression engines might need more cranking amps and so a
marine battery would not be for them perhaps.. but our little VW engines
don't have this problem. RVers also use marine batteries, which also
tolerate a deeper discharge without suffering any permanent damage.. thus
the term, &quot;deep cycle&quot;.   Jan B
