I went on a small 3 hour road trip this last weekend, and on the way there 
my tach went crazy going from 3500 to 4500 while I was going 70, and an hour 
later it was maxed out above the 7000 mark. It did this once before and I 
had rechecked connections and made sure the diode that came with it was 
connected properly, and after that it stopped acting up. I was wondering if 
the little diode can go bad? The archives say not having a diode is the 
cause of varying RPM's, but I have one. Should I try installing another from 
radio shack? Or could this be caused be something on the engine? Any 
suggestions are appriciated.
