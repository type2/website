I agree with George's comments and experience.

At each oil change/valve adjustment [anywhere between 2,000 to 3,000 miles,
depending on circumstances] I check my timing and dwell settings.
Theoretically, if the timing hasn't changed the dwell shouldn't be changed
either - but in reality that's not always so.  Even if the timing and dwell
check out OK I pop the cap and check the cap, rotor, and points visually.
That's probably unnecessary, but I'm old and set in my ways.

Given no problems in the electrical/ignition system I find I rarely replace
points [and plugs] before 20,000 miles and often go as long as 30,000 miles.
This has worked well for me for over 20 years of daily driving 1600-engined
'68 &amp; '70 Westphalias.  I still have a couple of sets of plugs and points,
and a spare cap, rotor, and condenser in my spares box under the back seat,
but have never had to use them for anything but normal maintenance [see
above].

FWIW.....

&gt;  I think Pertronix is  a &quot;poor answer to a question no one asked&quot;!  &lt;

&gt;&gt;  I tend to agree.  I get a _lot_ of miles on a set of points and very
seldom need to adjust them.  Perhaps 30K miles on points and 10K between
adjustments.  Once worn in, they are very stable.  &lt;&lt;
