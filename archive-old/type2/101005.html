&gt; List!,
&gt; Thanks a lot to the dozen or so generous folks that responded to my call for
&gt; help. Especially to Nick and Chris. Bob at
&gt; http://www.type2_dot_com/~airswork/rescue/us/md.html#Maryland was a lifesaver.
&gt; 
&gt; The bus is rescued from the man and safely stored away. May have to bring it

great, glad it was saved, now you have time to decide what to do.

&gt; back to Denver from Maryland. Two cars may be one too many for a recent
&gt; college grad looking for work, especially when it needs the care that a bus
&gt; does.

you may be right there

good luck
Bob
