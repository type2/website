Subject: RE: [T2] New Timing Scale

But can it fix my failed main bearing and crappy compression? :)

As soon as I followed the directions (ahem), it fit perfectly. Evidently
when most folks rebuild a type 4 motor, they fail to re-use the stock length
cooling fan to flywheel bolts. If the bolts are longer than stock, they
slash the timing scale from behind. 

Lo and behold, mine bolts were not the correct ones and I needed to shim the
scale with the supplied washers.

Too bad I have to rebuild the motor now, but my buddy Kevin is going to do
it between building 2.8L Porsche twin turbo race motors. Tee hee hee hee
hee.

Oh, and the scales will fit a 914 and 912 Porsche too!

Jon
