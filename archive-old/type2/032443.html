I have a couple of door handles off of a '73 that I could sell you for $10 + shipping for the pair (I'm 95% sure that the key is in one of them, but I will check my barn when I get home tonight just to be sure) That way you would be able to lock your doors, but it would be a different key than your ignition.  Let me know if interested.

Hi! I just joined this list and I was wondering if
anybody has had this need before. Several months ago I
bought a 1971 bus, but the key I have only works in
the ignition so I am stuck with a bus that has
unlockable doors. What seems to be the best way to fix this?
