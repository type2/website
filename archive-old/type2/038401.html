Subject: Need some help Picking the Right Bus!!

Hello--Just sold my 85 Westy and I want to get into the world of the 
aircooled..(tired of worrying about my Head Gaskets Blowing Up)..So I am 
looking for some advice as to good years..bad years..etc...FI vs. Carb 
setup..So if someone could give me a slight tutorial I would appreciate it. I 
am currently about to purchase a 79 Westy...any thoughts on my potential 
decision? Thanks for the help..If there is any list member looking to 
sell...I am looking to buy :)This list is great..Adam
