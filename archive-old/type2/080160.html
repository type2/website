Subject: Re: [T2] OTHER WHEEL CHOICES

You'll probably get plenty of answers on this, but 17x7&quot; shouldn't be a
problem, the alloy wheels on my '74 Sopru Campmobile are actually 15 x 5.5JJ
with (I think) 26mm offset (not marked too clearly on these wheels), but I'm
running 205/70/15 BF Goodrich Touring T/As all round (a fraction taller than
stock, I believe, the tyres were chosen for a planned extended trip around
Australia, so the extra gearing &amp; clearance would have been of use), totally
standard bodywork, and they don't touch at all.

(Mind you, you can just put your fingers between the tyre &amp; the inner
wheelwell lip in the rear, but in about 2 years I've never seem any marks on
the tyre to indicate that it's ever touched.)

Hope this is of use.

Now the 18x8.5&quot; Anteras with 20mm offset are going to be more of a
challenge, the outer edge is level with the inner lip, suspension hanging,
no tyre, I THINK I may be able to just fit in 225/45/18s in, if I do
something about the inner lip of the rear guards, but if not, they'll be
good for fitting for shows maybe ;^) Anyway, at $550 AUD (about $250USD) ,
including a black powder coat job, for the set of 4, I couldn't pass them up
&amp; can't really lose much on the deal ;^)

&gt; All this talk about wheels inspired me to shop the &quot;mainstream&quot; (although
if
&gt; you are buying custom wheels, they might as well be bigger right?). I sent
&gt; in the question below to tires dot com and they sent me back the response
&gt; you see. i doubt that 17inch wheels with 7 inches of tread width would
&gt; actually fit on a bay window, so i queried them again and haven't yet
heard
&gt; back. does anyone know of any other custom wheel choices that fit our
&gt; hassle-laden bolt pattern and look &quot;cool?&quot; my local import vw shop
&gt; (autosport, vancouver wa) said they had a choice from Rocket Wheels, but
&gt; &quot;lost the faxed copy&quot; and said they'd look for it. anyway, follow the link
&gt; and see how COOL our busses might be...
