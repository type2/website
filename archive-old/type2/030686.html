I think first, I'd try to figure out why it wasnt starting.  

Tell us the story, and we'll try to walk you through fixing the problem,
instead of possibly compounding it.

As a note, if the bus wont start now, starter fluid will not likely help.
It might get it to spit and sputter, but not to run. (at least, not long
enough to drive!)

Might help if you are flooded, but flooding a FI engine is an art to begin
with...;p

let us know.
