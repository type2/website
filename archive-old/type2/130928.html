Subject: testing engine

Hopefully this will be my last set of questions about testing an engine.

How do I hook up the electrical connections for the fuel pump? Do I just run 
the positive and neg to their respective terminals on the battery?

What do I connect to the positive side of the coil? Should this be run to 
the battery?

Besides the wire from the alternater and the wire from the starter, what do 
I run to the starter? A wire from positive battery to the bolt that doesn't 
connect to the starter?

Thanks,
Hope this is it.
Kyle
