I just got back from one of my dream road trips!

Mammoth to Mt. Shasta to the coast - a week up the coast then into 
Tacoma - 5 days in Seattle/Tacoma then back to Shast then home!

Her Majesty and I had a BLAST!

Next time I leave the mountain bike at home and take the surfbaord and 
wetsuit! I NEVER knew that you could SURF in Oregon and Washington!

:-)
