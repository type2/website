&gt; &gt; and to go do it. I forsee the list being extremely helpful. Question.. I'm 
&gt; &gt; going on a trip next week to look at one that seems promising. It's a '79 
&gt; &gt; automatic bus that's been converted to a camper. The owner says that the only 
&gt; &gt; repair it needs are new push rods, and depending on my offer, he will have 
&gt; &gt; that done for me. Roughly what should a repair like that cost being done at a 
&gt; &gt; garage?

I agree with the other comments, also want to add that the Automatic
transmission cannot be tested without pumping it up, this can be done with
very expensive equipment, or by running the engine.

the automatic when it is right is a good tranny, BUT if it is messed up it
can be a dificult and expensive repair.

make damn sure the tranny is working correctly BEFORE plunking yer money
down. (figure $500-1,000 off the price if the tranny is bad)

it's a three speed.  you should get an upshift at about  12-18mph and
30-40mph, down shift at about 35mph and 15mph give or take not critical,
BUT it should shift smoothly and solidly, no slippage, smell the tranny
fluid, it should not smell burned (unless synthetic they all smell like
that right out of the bottle)  there should be very little &quot;Clunk&quot; if at
all when shifting from forward to reverse.  shifter should be smooth with
only the detents catching,  this is a govenor based shifter it is the can
on the side of the tranny above the left rear drive shaft. check for any
tranny fluid around the edges, tranny fluid is reddish.  also check to see
if there are any tranny leaks where the engine and tranny join, could be
leaking torque convertor, expensive repair, torque converter are hard to
find in good condition.  a little leakage around the dip stick tube entry
into the square pan on the bottom or around the seal is a minor problem
and can be easily fixed

Hope this helps

&gt; This doesn't make sense.  Pushrods seldom fail.  It would only be about
&gt; $20 to replace them all, and it could be done in an hour of shop time.
&gt; 
&gt; Since this is such a simple repair, it would be to the seller's advantage
&gt; to get this fixed himself and have a good-running bus to sell.  Since he
&gt; wants to sell the problem to you, I would be suspicious of his 
&gt; information.
&gt; 
&gt; Considering that '79s have one of the more complex engines, I would insist
&gt; that the bus be in good running order before I plunked down my money.  If
&gt; it isn't in good running order, consider it to be the same as a bus
&gt; without an engine at all.
