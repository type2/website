Subject: 72 Progress &amp; 1800 Vacuum Questions

You may remember I got a 72 bus that was in a flood, and so far I've replaced 
the 
engine, transmission, rear brakes, rear bearings, brake servo, reasonable 
facsimilie 
of a servo hose (high-pressure oil hose), air check, shocks, clutch &amp; gas 
cable. 

the engine/transmission was one that came out of the motor hole after sitting 
for about 7 years. It was from a 1974 bus 1800. So the engine is in and I've 
set the 
valves, run a full tune-up &amp; oil change. decent compression 115 135 135 115, 
timed
for the 1974, 1976-1978 distributor (one vacuum port) 7.5 Btdc. 

My vacuum lines run thus:  
distributor advance to left carb outside port, 
left carb inside port plugged, 
small port idler bar plugged, 
large port idler bar - brake servo hose
inner thermostatic valve port to air cleaner port
outer thermostatic valve port to right carb outside port

So anyway I ran the library write-up on twin solex tuning written by Dave S. 
I wasn't 
getting any adjustment so I rebuilt the carbs and tried again. A little 
better, but now
it's time to chase down all the vacuum leaks since the Rpms are running 
1700-2000 instead of 1000.

Questions: I've got a disabled Main idling electromagnetic cut-off jet. Do I 
need a functioning one and if not, must I keep a wire attached to it? 

Not satisfied with the little light metal intake manifold gaskets, I bought 
some different larger intake gaskets from mofoco, shaped more like the 
bakelite gaskets
on the FI engines. Not sure which intake gaskets people have had success with?

Between the Carb and the intake manifolds, I have these same bakelite gaskets
in the single rather than double variety. The carb rebuild kits only come 
with one
carb base gasket. It seems like there should also be a base gasket between 
the 
bakelite and the manifold (vacuum) - are these bakelites necessary to 
maintain 
the head for the air cleaner or some more important reason?

One last one. The outsides of my intake manifolds each have a large plug 
screwed
into the end, which are tightened with a 36mm wrench. Anyone ever experienced 
these before?   

I hope this isn't too long. Anyway, I'd welcome any advice or corrections. 
Thanks
