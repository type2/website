Greetings,
My wife and I are going to spend the weekend in DC.  We have a very nice
totally stock 1978 7 passenger, with factory air, of a color my wife
affectionately calls baby diarrhea green.  We had it shipped out of
south cal and it has a shocking lack of rust.  Anyway if there is some
one on the list round there who wants to compare busses that would be
keen.  Maybe we could meet on the mall and freeze our tushes off
together.  My treat on a cup of hot chocolate.  Our names are Beth and
Jon.  We live near Atlantic City, NJ.
Jon
