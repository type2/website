Subject: RE: Alcohol instead of petrol/gasoline (Brazil?)

The &quot;oxygenated&quot; fuels required in many parts of the USA are, essentially, a 
form of gasohol.  Several years experience in Western Washington has shown 
that there is a perceptible difference (engines don't run as well/smoothly).  
This is made painfully obvious when the oxygenated fuels are seasonally 
discontinued by some of the oil companies.

These fuels accelerate the deterioration of fuel lines, fuel pump diaphragms, 
etc.  There are alcohol resistant fuel lines available, but I'm not aware of 
similarly resistant materials for diaphragms, gaskets, and seals.

It is interesting that when this issue first surfaced over a decade ago the 
Coast Guard was concerned enough about fuel line deterioration to make a VERY 
BIG DEAL out of it, issuing all sorts of dire safety warnings.  Marine trade 
organizations quickly responded with new fuel line materials that were 
&quot;alcohol proof&quot; (and also much more expensive).  

The automobile manufacturers phased in revised fuel system components, but the 
safety issue wasn't really brought to the attention of the general public as 
it had been by the Coast Guard and marine interests.  In fact, those of us who 
wanted to retrofit our vehicles with alcohol resistant fuel lines had to go to 
marine suppliers to obtain the material.  For a long time it simply wasn't 
available at automotive suppliers.
