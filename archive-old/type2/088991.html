Subject: Guage Calibration

Happy Weekend, List.

I have a new VDO oil pressure guage that seems to read low. The reason I
think this is because the needle sits beow zero when the power is on, but
before the engine is running. Engine off = 0 pressure, power on = guage
reading from sensor, should put the needle at 0, but it sits belowthe zero
hash mark. Is there any way that I can calibrate the needle to the zero
point?

Suggestions, advice, and irrational opinions welcomed!
