&gt; Many tow truck operators tend to be less than helpful when dealing with auto

	Gee... you'd think that would be different if we auto club members had
a reputation for tipping well ;) I tip well, realizing the fact that
they don't get much for the tow. ...surprizes the heck out of them
sometimes. 

  They're often
&gt; anxious to finish up the auto club tow and get back to more lucrative work.

That I can't blame them for.

&gt; This is also why some tend to prioritize non-auto-club tows in front of auto
&gt; club tows, regardless of which got called in first; hence the
&gt; commonly-experienced 2 hour wait for an auto club tow. 

Ethics wasn't a problem where I worked. First come, first serve... with
elevated priority given to police/emergency calls. Myself, I've never
waited more than 45 minutes for a AAA truck... that's in 12 years.

 Not that I'm saying
&gt; this attitude is justified or excusable.  If they didn't want to work for
&gt; that price, they didn't have to sign on with AAA in the first place.

Most wrecker services have some kind of arrangement with auto clubs to
even out the times when business is slow. Someone somewhere will always
be desperate enough to take the low-pay work. They don't want to work
for that price, but they can't afford to turn down the extra business.

  Some
&gt; auto clubs allow you the option of arranging your own tow and then applying
&gt; for reimbursement later.

Few and far between... because motor clubs flinch at paying the going
rate. When they do have to, the club member usually gets put on the high
risk list.

  This is more work later but can result in a faster
&gt; tow at the time.

Sure... the quality of work is often adjusted to suit the level of pay.

  However, few will tow anywhere near the 100 miles that AAA
&gt; Plus does.

That is one of their good selling points, and I have used that in the
past to my advantage. I think Allstate or someone else has a similar
mileage limit, with no restriction on whose Bus (!) is being towed...

Imagine what would happen if the multitudes stopped tipping pizza
delivery people...
