Subject: Re: [T2] ignition help/mechanic problems

Hi- we have a 78 camper, and have fixed up a 75 bus for my daughter who
has been driving for a year now.  Intermittant problems are a bear, and
you need to understand the system enough to know what to check (or
eliminate) when it is happening. Loss of power is a bit vague- you mean
it drives but protests when stepping on the gas, or does it simply stop
dead? If the latter will it restart in any way after this happens?   FI
engines still use an old principle- suck in air and gas, compress it,
and add a spark at the right time.  You gotta know it is getting gas,
air, and a spark. If totally dead, I'd first check for a proper spark by
yanking a spark plug wire off a plug and inserting an old gapped plug
and grounding the side of the plug- you should see a nice blue spark
jumping the plug gap.  If you have no plug, try either adding a nail or
screw to the recessed connector. If you see a spark I'd presume the
engine is getting no gas or an improper mix. One can get a can of
starting ether, but do not spray it into the air cleaner as a backfire
can ruin the air flow meter between this and the throttle.  Look for a
large hose that connects the intake manifold (black box in the center
with many hose connections) and yank any upper connection (usually to
the large s-shaped hose).  Spray about 3 seconds down this, reconnect,
and quickly try to start the bus.  If it runs for a few seconds then the
timing is probably OK  &amp; I would suspect a lack of gas or totally wrong
fuel/air mix.
     The ECU or &quot;brain&quot; found behind the battery gets information from
sensors that determine how much air is entering, engine temperature and
timing, and it opens and closes the injectors at the right time and
VARIES the amount of gas (opening time) depending on the info it gets. 
Proper gas pressure is crucial, for if too low, the injectors will still
open, but the mix will be LEAN (air/fuel ratio too high).  This problem
can be caused by a weak/intermittant fuel pump, a bad pressure regulator
that returns fuel to the tank, and a blocked gas line  from the tank to
the pump.  The latter can cause intermittant problems, and personally
I'd yank the line from the tank to the pump and see if it flows nicely
under gravity  or lets out silt or poor flow!  Change the fuel filter. 
The old one can be checked by sawing all around it to show what the
filter caniste3r has been dealing with.  Fuel delivery is usually
checked with a pressure gauge or one can at least check flow by
unscrewing the takeoff port bolt (left side, the metal section of the
fuel rail) and attaching a long hose that will reach a bottle.  Trying
to start the bus should show a heathy flow (and a Muir book or Bentley
manual will show the spec).
     If one has air leaks AFTER the air flow meter, the mix also will be
too lean.  The temp and air sensors can be checked with nothing more
than a $20 digital volt/ohm meter from Radio Shack.  The connectors to
these must be clean and can cause intermittant problems if loose, or
kinked.    Hoses that leak air into the manifold is the most common
problem, and it can be intermittant if the hose is cracked and the air
being sucked may depend it is hot and pliable or cold and stiff. 
Usually these leaks are not big enough to stop starting, but can affect
idle when cold, or affect running when more throttle is demanded.  I'd
yank every hose end ( twist it off) and look at the edges of the hose-
if it breaks upon yanking REPLACE IT, or if it is cracked at the edges
and the crack travels under the hose braiding.  The hoses connecting the
airbox to the manifold tubes leading to the heads are more difficult and
one can use a smoke stick (ask the guys who do radon mitigation) near
the connections.  A temp fix to get one home is to have gasket silicone
at hand and glop it around a bad connection.

I
 should go back to points. I think that this seems rather insane but due

 my limited knowledge have no idea what to do now. I am hoping some of
the
 vw gurus out there could bestow some of their knowledge upon me. Thanks
