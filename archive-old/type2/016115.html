Subject: 10 digit serial numbers

All,

With the recent talk about serial numbers, I wanted to check on mine. 
Especially since my bus was manufactured 11/78, and the Westy package was 
complete 1/79.  The serial is 239-205-801-9. When did the 10 digit 
serials begin. Was it for the 79 model year, or earlier. If it still 
follows the same convention of the 9 digit numbers, would that make my 
bus be the 2,058,019th bus to be made for the 79 model year? If that were 
so, then assuming VW started manufacturing the 79 model year in Aug or 
Sept, then VW would have to have had a production rate of ~16,000 - 
20,000 busses per day to meet that production rate.  Neigh impossible 
even by today's standards, at any one vehicle manufacturing plant.
