&gt; In the Bronx the procedure is as follows:
&gt; 1. Go to the hardware store and buy a padlock and
&gt; two piece locking clasp.
&gt; 2. get out screw gun and screw clasp into the bus
&gt; next to engine door.
&gt; 3. screw other part of clasp on the door across from
&gt; first part.
&gt; 4. shut door and put padlock on.
&gt; 
&gt; That's it.

Sounds ugly and down here all the criminals have bolt
cutters. A padlock doesn't slow down a criminal much.
