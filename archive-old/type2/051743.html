Subject: Re: [T2] Learning to drive a bus

I taught my youngest brother to drive my 71 Westy while I had it.  The low
gearing was very forgiving to him and he drove it like a pro and actually
enjoyed it while I had it.  The best place I've learned to take a new
drivr out is in the local cemetery with its winding roads, simulated
intersections and on occasional car or traffic to deal with.  There is
also a reminder all around you what irresponsible driving can cause.

I tried all manner of methods with my sister to try and explain and teach
her how to drive stick shift.  It never took - she can do it but doesn't
enjoy it because it takes too much thinking. &lt;SIGH&gt;  The best thing that
worked for her though was my advice that said, &quot;Listen to the engine.  It
talks to you and tells you what it needs.&quot;  Ever since then, she's managed
to never kill it (&quot;IT&quot; being the 74 Super.)
