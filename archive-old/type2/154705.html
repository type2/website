Subject: My new VW E Card site

Hi all I have just started a rough e card site with some of my vw photos from
the last few years. All of the photos are of  friends VW's hear in Australia.



I've decided to send my VW family a quick little e card for Christmas this
year and thought I'd share it with the mailing list.



Season's greetings to all, I've enjoyed reading the postings in 2006 and look
forward to 2007.



cheers



Peter

Australia
