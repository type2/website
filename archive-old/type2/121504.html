Subject: Re: [T2] Heat: Atwood Bilge Blower?

&gt;I want to do this on my 71 van. What I want to know is how I could put in 
&gt;a multi-position switch or, even better, a continuous resistor to control 
&gt;the speed. How much power will they draw? How hefty a resister will I need 
&gt;to control the speed? It would be ideal to use a stock VW switch, but the 
&gt;only pot on the dashboard controls the instrument lights, it can't be over 
&gt;10 watts. If I had to use a multi-position switch, could I use the 
&gt;windshield wiper switch and put an inline resistor for a &quot;slow&quot; speed? 
&gt;Sometimes I would want to clear the windshield right now, then turn it 
&gt;down for a boost while driving.

I got a file from a friend that showed how to run the fans in parallel and 
in series based on two 3 position toggle switches. Would provide three speeds.

Another option would be a three position switch (or a rotary switch with 
many more positions) and each switch position would power the fan through a 
diode (no diode = straight 12 v = fast, 1 diode in series with motor = 
medium fast, 2 diodes in series with motor = medium, 3 diodes = medium 
slow, 4 diodes = slow). Each diode represents a voltage drop you could 
experiment with using a multimeter. Each voltage drop equals a speed drop. 
Diodes cost less than fifty cents each so it would certainly be economical.

Another option would be a Ford heater switch (I have the NAPA part number 
at home) that costs about $10-$15 and would give pretty much any speed you 
want depending on the position of the switch. It is a large ceramic thing 
(sort of like a headlight switch). You may be able to ask for it at the 
counter and they know what you are talking about.

Just some food for thought. I think this info is in the archives in better 
detail.
