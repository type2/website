&gt; &gt;Is it possible to just order JUST a friction plate,

&gt; Sure it's possible, and I don't think you are being penny foolish.  Others
&gt; will probably disagree but I don't normally replace parts that aren't broken.

I very seldom replace the pressure plate, though I replace the friction
disc every time the engine is out.  As long as you don't abuse the clutch
the pressure plate will last a good long time.
