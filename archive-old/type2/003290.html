&gt; Volks,
&gt;    I need to know of a good some what high performance coil I can install
in
&gt; my '79 bus, FI, with Calif. emissions. I need to replace, however I would
&gt; like a better, hotter, spark than that from the stock coil. Any
&gt; suggestions??

A 79 Cal bus has electronic ignition. The coil used is not the same as a
point distributor coil. Rabbits, Audis, and Cal Vanagons with electronic
ignition all use the same coil. There is nothing wrong with this coil. Why
do you need a 'hotter' coil?? Sounds like you are trying to cover up another
problem!
