Subject: Re: [T2] Narrowest Wheel to fit late bus???

 &gt;&gt; Mercedes - all '77-'89
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;Anyone know if there's a 15 inch wheel from
 &gt;these years that is the same offset as the 14 inch...?

 &gt;Tired of the limitations of the 14 inch tires...;-(

People here in Oz have been successfully fitting larger rims from 
Mercedes and Audis. I suspect stock 15&quot; rims are easy to pick up as 
they are dumped in favour of larger sizes. The major issues AFAIK 
have been needing longer studs and needing to bore out the centre to 
fit over the VW grease cap. Of course with the extreme sizes you can 
only drive on straight roads! ;)
