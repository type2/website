Subject: Paint code needed for Yosemite Yellow

Hi Volks,

There is a local bus that I am doing some work on and I need a paint  
code for 1975 Yosemite Yellow. I can't find the code listed on any of  
the usual reference sites that google sends me to.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
