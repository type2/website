Subject: Re: [T2] Felt Pilot Bearing Seal and metal retaining

&gt; &gt;Anyone know where I can find a new felt sealing washer and the metal
&gt; &gt;ring that centers in in the flywheel for a type IV (2.0L). 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been having getting these small engine parts from BD also.
&gt;
&gt; Does the felt ring come with replacement pilot bearings? Can anyone
&gt; confirm this?

Hi
I can say that the Clutch kit from Bus Depot does not come with a
felt washer. Neither did the spare pilot bearing I bought though
them also.  I never see this for sale.  That's not to say the felt 
washer isn't available... prove me wrong. Since I couldn't locate one
and I've never seen a used one, my engine does not have one. What the
felt does is keep the clutch disc dust from entering the pilot bearing
grease. So far I've been OK, but it was put designed to be there for
a reason...


&gt; I've been looking for the metal washer with 5 holes, 021-105-275. The
&gt; only places I've found are the online porsche vendors and Porsche
&gt; dealer.

You shouldn't be having that much trouble finding the metal washer. 
I've never had trouble when ordering one for my engine. Keep 
looking maybe BD was just sold out temporarily.
  
Alex
