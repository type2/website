Subject: RE: [T2] PEACE RE:[T2] Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey

Can I use that Ghia some time;)

Or do what I do...if something upsets you, put the top down on your Karmann
Ghia and drive a little. After about 30 seconds you forget you were even
upset.

Peace, Duane from Bluffton, IN...It's sunny today :-)
