&gt; Got 'em from my FLAPS.  West Coast
&gt; Metric stuff.  I was surprised at the poor fit given WCM's reputation for good
&gt; rubber.  I gave Ron Salmon a call and he set me straight.  Seems that WCM both
&gt; manufactures and imports their products.  The door seals were Brazillian
&gt; aftermarket imports.  Not so hot.  And remember, Ron is a WCM dealer, so I was
&gt; thinking this guy is giving me the straight shot.

WCM has an excellent catalog and great prices but unfortunately you have to
call in every order and check on each item to determine if the rubber is
theirs or not. What they do make themselves is good just like as advertized.

They are running a special right now. Mention code B13 when ordering and get
15% off $150 or more until Nov. 7th.
