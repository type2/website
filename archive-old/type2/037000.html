Subject: Watch Out for Cheap Paint Jobs!!!  (was Paint Jobs)

I've located a 79 I'm considering. It is 550 miles away and I think I will go
check it out next week. It was recently painted. I've received both E and 
snail mail photos and it looks really good. My concern is the owner told me 
that there are some minor dents in the body. I can't understand the logic of 
a person going to the trouble and expense of a paint job and not doing the 
prep work. 

Be very, very, very careful here!!  This just screams Earl Scheib.  The ONLY 
reason I can think of someone having a new paint job on a bus without doing a 
reasonable amount of bodywork is that they had an Earl Scheib or lowest level 
Maaco ultra cheapie paint job applied to make it sellable.  They do almost no 
preparation.  I've heard (3rd. hand) of great chunks of paint blowing off on 
the freeway on the way home from Earl Scheib.  Before you invest any money on 
traveling to see the bus, insist the seller fax the receipt for the paint 
job.  A cheap paint job is worse than no paint job.  You will have to redo 
it, probably soon.  You would be better off if the cheap paint wasn't in the 
way because you'll have to remove it.  It won't serve as a base for a good 
paint job.  On this bus, the new paint job was probably just to hide 
something they don't want you to know about.
