&gt; Kark is WRONG, by the way.  He's mixing up passenger and truck tires.  The
&gt;  VW manual he quotes at me says EITHER a reinforced passenger tire, or a &quot;C&quot;
&gt;  rated truck tire.  The Michelin, Laredo and Kirkland all fit the bill, with
&gt;  max psi at around 50 lbs.

My tire search started with what the Bentley manual recommends.

It states this for a &quot;Delivery Van and Station Wagon from April 1972&quot;:
&quot;185 R x 14 C&quot;
&quot;Correct replacement tire must bear the letter &quot;C&quot; immediately after the 
number 14 in the size designation-and not elswhere.  The maximum load 
Inflation pressure listed on the tire should be 55 psi.&quot;

For &quot;Campmobile from August 1971&quot;
&quot;185 SR 14 Reinforced&quot;
&quot;Correct replacement tire must bear the word &quot;REINFORCED&quot;.  The maximum 
Inflation pressure listed on the tire should be 40 psi.&quot;

It also states for &quot;Campmobile from August 1971&quot; rear tire pressures &quot;Up to 
3/4 payload&quot; should be 37 psi  and &quot;Fully loaded&quot; 40 psi.

&quot;Delivery Van and station Wagon from April 1972&quot; rear tire pressures &quot;Up to 
3/4 payload&quot; should be 40 psi  and &quot;Fully loaded&quot; 44 psi.   

so...... how should I be interpreting this?  
My instinct for my 79 Deluxe westy was to go one step better with a D rated 
tire and thus not have to worry if I was ever pushing its limits.  Thats why 
the Yokohama seemed like a good choice.  (I did get one pmail just a while go 
affirming this).      

I still have a few days before my wheels are done, so I guess I will ask some 
more questions to make sure I am getting the straight story locally.
