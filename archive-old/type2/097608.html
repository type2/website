Subject: parts up for grabs

Cleaned out the shed.  Found two thirds of 79 Westy A/C system.  No
compressor, but I have the under body heat exchangeer and the unit that mounts
under the dash.  This is a factory-install model I took out several years ago
because I didn't want to spend $1500 for a new compressor.  Besides, why do I
need an A/C in Arizona?

Also have a water tank that the PO chopped about two inches off the top neck,
presumably because he could not get the filler out?  I would think it could be
repaired with the right type of plastic pipe or tube.

All free, in Phoenix AZ.  If it has to be shipped, you pay.  Contact me
directly at mustang8_at_mindspring_dot_com and it will be first come, first served.
