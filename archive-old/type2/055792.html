Subject: Re:  Westfalia (and other) side tents...(useability).

Fred Stoermer sez:

&gt; Apparently campgrounds in other parts of the US (and in Europe) do allow the 
&gt; van/tent combination to be erected and used, but out here, in our &quot;real 
&gt; world&quot;, you might as well leave that expensive accessory at home.
 
Well, I've camped in a lot of places, mostly around the west but some
places across the country to the east coast (I'm talking United States here).
Generally, I've found the campgrounds to be in better condition than the ones
Fred describes but I agree that in a large percentage of the cases, a
Westy tent wouldn't be very useful.  My favorite type of camping is
dispersed camping in National Forests where one drives out a dirt road
and finds a flat spot near the road and camps without facilities.  Often
a Westy tent would be useful in these situations.
