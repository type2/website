Did you actually take off the drive dog?  If not, then it's not that big
a deal.  It only goes in one way.  But if you did, then I'll try to
remember to take a look at my extra.

If you did leave your engine at tdc 1, then just peek down the hole and
match it up.  It should be pretty easy to see...

&gt; Having turned my distributor into an exploded view of itself I now find the
&gt; driving dog ( wierd name for it ) pegs that fit into the driveshaft are
&gt; offset. I have consulted manuals but they say to note the offset before
&gt; dismantling.........I say no more on this issue !!!
&gt; If the notch that holds the rotor is facing the firing/cylinder line on the
&gt; edge of the dizzy and I'm looking from above .....is the offset left or
&gt; right on the dog/dawg.
&gt; Hope this makes sense to anyone who has done this before.
