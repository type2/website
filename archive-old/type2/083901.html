But these tents were never an accessory offered by VW, or Westfalia, as
an option---
 
They were an add on by an individual, who for some ridiculous reason
didn't purchase the factory stuff from the git go---

Later,

Terry

&lt;&lt; I saw Nizza brand tents on the second link below and was wondering if
anyone knows when they started making these? Were they options for bays,
vanagons, and euros? I have a friend who has a couple of these and he
wants to know what years of busses they work best with. Any info would
be appreciated!

Alex, 
The Nizza tents have been available for about 4 years now. Similar tents
have been made since the mid 60's.
