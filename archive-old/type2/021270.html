That's an excellent idea with the solenoid.  I'll remember that!!

&gt; I had someone steal my Airflow meter and registration sticker once.  Got
&gt; in the car and started it.. tried to drive and it was just MUSH!  Boy
&gt; was I annoyed.
&gt; 
&gt; Got myself an AFM, but I got pulled over so many times until I finally
&gt; got that sticker.  What a mess.  I'm going to definately try and find a
&gt; keyed lock for that back hatch.  Or maybe put a cable actuated latch
&gt; that has a pull line in the bed of the rear compartment.  That way, you
&gt; need to pull up on the cable and it allows the engine compartment to be
&gt; opened.

&gt;         I prefer the solenoid operated un-lock.  Press a button(or alarm
&gt; remote) and voila!  Open door.  I would also suggest to anyone who cares
&gt; about their vehicle as much as I do, to invest in the alarm.  That little
&gt; blinking LED really does ward off the unruly...
