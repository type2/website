Subject: High Country Bus Festival

ONLY 10 more days till the 4th Annual High Country Bus Festival near Boone, 
NC !  for all info check out our website at:
http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~contecmidwest

I really want to thank the folks from the FULL MOON BUS CLUB who have 
volunteered to wake up early on SAT morning and cook us Breakfast!!  This is 
going to be a task,  looks like a BIG crowd this year will be bussing up the 
Mountain :-)

There are a few things that we are looking to get donated; to help off-set 
some of the expenses from cooking for such a large group.  Snoopy, from FULL 
MOON has created an E-Shopping List,  please click on the link below and 
sign up to bring something for the tummy's of the masses.

There are a few of us still planning to play slacker golf at 10:30 on 
Saturday Morning.  If you are interested in joining please e-mail me.

Saturday night we will be playing the live version of the VW Family Feud, 
just before the awards ceremony.

Sunday we will line up for a group photo at 9:30, and depart for the caraBUS 
along the Blue Ridge Parkway about 10:00am.

Thanks to all of you who got your shirt orders in by the deadline,  please 
see me when you arrive at the festival and I will get you your 
shirts/koozies.

take care and see all of you there!
