&gt; George,

&gt; Thanks for the reply.  I have a dual port heat riser that is really plugged
&gt; hard.  Can you tell me about the access hole that you made and how you seal it
&gt; when you're through cleaning?  Also could you give me a little more detail on
&gt; how you made the rotary scraper.

The hole is on the front side of the heat riser tube, on the right hand
side, just outboard of the straight section beneath the carburator.  The
position of the hole is directly in line with the centerline of the
straight section.

I made the hole with a 1/8 inch carbide bit in a Dremel too, It would be
difficult (but not impossible) to do this with a regular drill.  The
manifold must be removed to do this, of course.

The scraper is a 18 inch length of 1/8 welding rod with one end hammered
into a blunt blade about 1/2 inch long, then bent in an &quot;s&quot; shape that
places the flat surface on the side
of the tube when the scraper is inside the tube.  You'll have to
experiment a bit to get it right!

After cleaning, I use a stainless-steel hose clamp to cover the hole.  A
film of permatex red sealant prevents any exhaust leak, although I doubt
that it would leak without the sealant.
