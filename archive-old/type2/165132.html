&gt; You should not have any 'dead' space between the rocking of the

&gt; If I'm confused and it is valve overlap, then my believed TDC

I didn't think of a third possibility: my memory sucks and the dead
space I thought I remembered wasn't really happening.  Sorry for the
chicken-little departure from the original thread.  That's 2 public
brain fades in one day.  Jeez... add in all the private brain fades,
and I had one heckofa day.  Glad Monday's over.
