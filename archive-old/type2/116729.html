Subject: body work

I thought I would post this here and get some ideas :

I have a question for the readers.  My bus is suffering from
a little of the rust cancer.  Rear fenders.. An idea I had was to do what I
see a lot of jeep owners doing. Simply cut the rust out and replace the area
with that stainless diamond patterned sheet metal.  Either weld or rivot it
in place. I was thinking it might look pretty neat if it was duplicated on
both sides. For the flaring over the wheels simply cut the fender full 
identical
to the front rather than the half hidden look.

Seen anyone do this rather than the standard cut out / body fill procedure?
