&gt;&gt; This low capacity is why I decided to go with a gas heater rather than
&gt;&gt; propane.  A gas heater takes about a gallon a night, and with a couple of
&gt;&gt; spare gas cans, you could take an extended trip in a cold place without
&gt;&gt; having to worry about running out.  Plus, when you do run out, how far do
&gt;&gt; you have to drive to get propane?  What if you're in Alaska or Canada?
I made the mistake of driving a propane powered vehicle down to the States
a couple of years ago.  What a nightmare!!!  Up here (well, actually I live
south of the 49th parallel, but metaphorically up here) there are propane
tanks everywhere.
