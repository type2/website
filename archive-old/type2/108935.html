Hey Mark

No, I didnt make it. The back window and hatch seal started leaking pretty
bad so I stayed home and replaced it. I didnt want to get caught in the rain
all weekend with it leaking. Figures it turned out to be nice weather on
Sunday. Next year for sure!

&gt; Hi Jasan,
&gt;
&gt; Did you make it up the Puyallup &quot;spring meet&quot;?  I unforunately had too
much
&gt; going on, but it sounds like good times were had by all.
