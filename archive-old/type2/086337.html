Subject: Talking About Valves

&gt;Also, what are the risks to valves that are tightened to .002 (too tight)

If your valves are set too tight then when the motor gets warmed up and the
metal parts
expand, there is no space to accomodate the expansion between the tappet
screw and the
valve stem, and so the tappet screw pushes on the valve stem, so that the
valve never
properly closes as its supposed to do, in order to keep it cool enough to
live a long time.
Instead it sits out in the combustion chamber and gets really really hot,
and starts to
'burn', getting all black and crispy, so that when you do finally set your
valves to the
proper clearance, your valve could already be too cooked to properly seal
and then you start
to get leaks past it (maybe it has a pie shaped crack now) and your
compression in that chamber
starts to leak bad so your compression readings drop and then you're running
on 3 cylinders,
then as time goes by you eventually take off for the weekend and start to
climb a long grade
and the bus can't pull the grade on 3 cylinders doing 60 in the heat and
then either the oil starts to boil, cooking your main bearings, or maybe a
10mm rocker shaft nut unscrews and starts banging around under your valve
cover, or your red light comes on...etc. you end up calling a tow truck.
