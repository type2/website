Subject: Re: [T2] oil strainer stud





&gt;Hi all,

I was noticing when I changed the oil in my bus, the oil strainer stud &amp;
the oil pickup is loose. I can wiggle maybe a 1/4&quot;.&lt;

Mine does the same thing.

&gt; It has been awhile since
I had one apart. Is this normal? I do not ever remember having one like
this.&lt;

Your lucky, my mounting bolt leaks like a sive.
