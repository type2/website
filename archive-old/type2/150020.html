Subject: finally made that headliner order

after five years of ownership i ordered the new headliner for my doublecab.
now that i think i can do windshields, with help, i'm all about the
headliner job. i went with sewfine. they sent me a two inch patch and the
material seemed identical to the headliner on my 69 sunroof. thanks to all
who offered suggestions a few months ago. most said sewfine fit better which
got me started in that direction.

any new thoughts out there on the headliner insulation issue? i'm handcuffed
by the idea.

in other bus news i took my family and the sunroof down to san francisco for
a new kind of adventure. we stayed two weeks. over xmas we inhabited a
garage/illegal studio that had a separate bedroom and bath near
22nd/florida. the following week the hosts left for a eight days and we took
over the upstairs. the garage was immaculate so who could resist a points
change. but the big deal before that was doing a valve adjustment with my
wife, her first ever. i reeled in the illusion that auto repair is a clean,
dry thing. the other even bigger deal was the hosts put their bmw on 22nd
street, and sunroof got royal inside executive treatment alongside the alfa
romeo. the alfa had a flat. i put the spare on so things didn't look too
shabby. sf is still great great. sold lots of pots, and got into a new store
in hayes valley. the last night spent there we boondocked on a secret &quot;flat&quot;
spot in potrero hill for one night of kid-friendly urban camping.
unbeatable.  

btw, does anybody on the list know who owns the white 71 westy on florida
between 22/23rd?  - steve
