Subject: Folks who bought my cabinets at EB2003

I didn't get names, but I need to contact the folks who bought my cabinets at
EveryBus. I think I left my shoes in the bottom of the sink cabinet. Didn't
really need them until Sunday morning - when everyone was packing and
leaving...

They were at the far end of the camp area - away from the pavillion...

-Eric
