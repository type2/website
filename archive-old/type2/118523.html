Subject: Re: [T2] re: idiot guide book for vw's

What I like about the &quot;Idiot&quot; book is that it is written by someone who
owned and worked on new and used VWs. I have four different editions of the
Idiot book. I also have the Haynes (Beetle, Type2 1600, Type2
1700/1800/2000, Vanagon 80-83), Chilton (49-71 &amp; 70-79) and Bentley, 14
different manuals in all!... whats not in one is usually in the other.
