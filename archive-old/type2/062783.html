Subject: HANGIN' DOG

HEY!  I am trying to get some people together to go to the Hanging Dog   
National Campground event in Murphy NC the weekend of the 13,14,15Th.   
  It is sponsored by Cool Breeze VW club.  There is going to be a cookout   
Saturday night -covered dishes will be welcomed.
 I live in Greensboro NC and would like to see if anyone else is going by   
here toward the event.  If so e-mail me direct at ESOWDER_at_RFMD.COM  
  If you need more information about the event call Alan Hawkins at   
(704)837-0304   or George Rymer at (423) 476-6964
  They said they had about 30 busses last year and that that it is open   
to enyone who likes VW's ,  supposed to be really laid back.
 Hope to hear from some of you out there,   Thanks

Erick
