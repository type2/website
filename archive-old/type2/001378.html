The engine that currently resides in my bus is WITHOUT thermostat
( apparently, these are seen as superfluous in recon' engines here in the
u.k.?)
...trouble is , that I, in cold weather always have a prob' keeping her
ticking over till shes warmed up.....after that all's o.k.
.... 1.) can I refit the thermostat without dropping the engine?
.....2.)&quot;apparently&quot;, one of the hot-air pickups is blocked ( left )
......and this needs to be unblocked.......
.....my 'mackie' (mechanic) established this by the fact that once the
engine was running hot,  only the right hand one was too hot to place your
hand on........this is attributed the the cause of stalling....
..._dot_can anyone help on this ?
( I'm not sure whether I'm talking about the right thing when I refer to the
hot-air pickup, but, if you look at the engine as you would from the rear,
on either side , coming up at a 30 degree angle are two thin'ish
pipes )...it's these.
thanks to all of you.....Garp/Liis/Isis
