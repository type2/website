Subject: Re: engine cooler

Bob-
       In addition to cooling buildings- I've worked in NYC often enough to 
have seen such
&quot;swamp coolers&quot; utilized in a sealed system that have an inverse radiator to 
continually
cool and recool the air. The system uses a continuous flow of water through 
the rad-
iator to actually chill the air. Obviously this system only works if  you 
have a continous
supply of unmetered (free), water. On the other hand I'd be more than a 
little leery of
introducing more moisture into a closed and rust-prone environment such as a 
Bus in-
terior or the engine compartment (what's the condition of your 20-30 year old 
battery
tray?). If you've got the bucks, though, consider water injection for the 
engine itself.
Not, I repeat, not the J.C.Whitney add-on that may still be in the catalog, 
but a real one
designed to prevent detonation in supercharged and turbocharged engines. Very 
pricey, but I've driven a one-off special that had such a system and the 
power increase
was phenominal.
