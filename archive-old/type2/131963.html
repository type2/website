Subject: FI Questions

stock '79 FI 2.0L California emissions.  Several questions.

1.  I just went to test fuel pressure and noticed something that 
doesn't seem right.  When I turn the ignition to the run position (not 
the start) position, the fuel pump runs continuously maintaining 38PSI. 
  I was under the impression that the fuel pump was not supposed to 
start until the starter was operated.

2.  When I start the engine and have it at idle, I can un-plug the air 
flow meter, and the engine will hesitate, but then continue to idle.  
It will die if I try to rev it.  I understand this to be normal.  What 
I don't understand is that when I unplug the air flow meter, the fuel 
pressure goes down to near zero, but the engine continues to run.  
Where is the fuel coming from when there is no fuel pressure and where 
is the signal to open the injectors coming from???

3.  These are the fuel pressures that I measured:
	Engine not running, key on on position  38 PSI
	Engine running at idle, 900RPM vacuum hose disconnected from fuel 
pressure regulator  37 PSI
	Engine running at idle, 900RPM vacuum hose connected to fuel pressure 
regulator  32 PSI
	Engine running, 3000 RPM, vacuum hose connected to fuel pressure 
regulator  27 PSI

	Do these values seem normal?  Would any of these conditions contribute 
to a lean condition?

4.  What would be a normal vacuum reading at the air distribution box 
(plenum)???

Thanks
