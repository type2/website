Subject: 65 mph expectations and head question (loss of power)

Is 65 mph realistic for a 71 Westy (1600 DP) Rebuilt Engine, new heads
installed with all tin and rubber? I'd like to be able to obtain that?

 

Another note:

 

A shop replaced the &quot;crappy&quot; GEX heads about 2k miles ago with new heads
that did not have the fly cut (like on 71 heads) with the reasoning that the
compression would drop but the engine would run cooler ???. Well it seems to
run almost as hot (Gene Berg dipstick installed) and the engine seems to
have lost some pep and top end. Feels like she is struggling some at 60 mph,
my buddy in his 70 Westy (1600 Single Port) out runs me on the highway.

 

Any advice here with both issues would be great: 65 mph (fact or fiction)
and did my engine regress some with the other style heads installed?

 

Thanks,
