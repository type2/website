Subject: Re: [T2] Shocks for Van = Shocks for Bay?

&gt; &gt; Would a set of rear shocks for an Early Vanagon fit a Late Bay?

I don't know much about them at all. I was hoping someone with experience 
with both might know if they would fit.

&gt;Didn't the Vanagon rear suspension do away with the torsion bar design?
