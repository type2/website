Hoo, boy, we oughtta make a FAQ on this......

The wire that comes out of the steering shaft and clips onto the crome
ring under the horn button attaches in some mysterious way to the steering
shaft.  It does *NOT* come out the bottom of that shaft anywhere, so stop
looking.  

The wiring on the early '70s busses is as follows:

Power to the horn comes direct from the fuse box on a black wire. that's
the easy part.  Check for 12V when the key is on.  If it is there then
this side of the circuit is fine.

The horn is, in truly Lucas fashion, grounded thru the switch.  How?  Well
here is an abbreviated and very confusing summary.

The brown wire from the horn to the base of the steering column should
*not* be connected to ground.  It connects to the base of the steering
column shell. the steering column shell should also *not* be connected to
ground. It is isolated by a black plastic washer at the base of the
steering column and from the turn signal/wiper switch assembly by the big
rubber donut.  It does connect to the steering wheel, however, which is
isolated by its casting from the steering column.  the crome horn ring is
isolated from the steering wheel/steering column shell by the spring
standoffs.  This is the &quot;break&quot; in the ground circuit (I *told* you it was
a Lucas design) that acts as a switch.  the horn ring is connected to the
steering column by the mystery wire that leads into the center of the
steering column.  The steering column is connected around the rubber
square to the steering box shaft which is connected to the frame and thus
the negative lead of the battery.  Whew! 

THUS:

The way to diagnose and fix horn problems is to take your VOM and measure
the resistance between the frame and

a) the brown wire from the horn to the steering column shell
b) the steering column shell
c) the steering wheel.
d) the horn ring

All of these measurements should show infinite resistance when the
horn is not pressed and 0 resistance when it is.  I will bet real money
that resistance is 0 on all three at all times.  To fix this you will need
to disassemble and reassemble the column, checking resistances at every
step 'til you find the flaw.  PITA?  You bet!  OTOH, the only way I have
ever gotten the damned thing fixed.  BTW, you will need a &quot;mongo&quot; brand
set of snap ring pliers and a good steering wheel puller.
