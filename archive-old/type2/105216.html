Subject: Re: [T2] Rear torsion bar adjustment (can I get my rear down?)

&gt; Hi volks,
&gt;

&gt; When I bought my 75 westy a year ago, it came with the rear end
elevated 2-3 inches higher than the front. This doesn't sound like much,
but when sleeping with my head toward the front, it is enough to make me
feel like I am lying downhill. It also gives my bus this sorta funky hot
rod look that I don't really like. It handles very well and I cannot find
any modifications to the rear end so my questions are:
&gt;
&gt; Can the torsion bar be adjusted (or mis-adjusted) to the point of
causing this drastic difference?

Absolutely!  What probably happened is that the PO &quot;fixed&quot; a sag problem
by simply rotating the spring plate one spline, rather than set the bars
properly.

&gt; If so, shouldn't my bus be handling really bad?

Well, worse than normal, but not terrible.  What will be terrible is the
damage to the CVs and boots from running at excessive angles continuously.
Fix it!
