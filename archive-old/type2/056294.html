Hello Listees,

I have a 78 bus that occasionally misfires under load, such as during
acceleration or climbing a hill.  It idles perfectly.  When it does misfire,
it shakes like hell.  No coughing or sputtering. It's like being in a paint
shaker.

I can't find anything because it's intermittent.  It cut out a little bit on a
trip about a month ago.  I'm going (was going) on a trip tomorrow, so it
started again last night shaking violently during acceleration.

I'm going out to trace all ignition as per Bentley.  Then I'll check double
relay, etc.

Any ideas?  It start and idles perfectly.  Screws up under load.  

PLEASE send me a post if you have any suggestions.

TIA

Fred
78 Westy (It only screws up when I want to drive it).
