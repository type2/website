Subject: Awkward Gears on a 1976 T2

------_=_NextPart_001_01C215D8.8E5BDF20

Hiya listies...

Gear problems...

I have recently bought a T2, 1600, 1976, and I am having some stress with
the gears.

First and Second gear are hard to get into, but with a little practice and
patience they will 'normally' go in... third and fourth are never a problem=
.

However after a 50mile motorway trip, the gears became significantly worse,=

with first and second nearly impossible to get... I attribute (perhaps
incorrectly) this to the temperature ?? 

In the morning the gears were back to the normal - difficult, but drivable
state.

Any ideas?
Is this likely to be a gearbox on last legs? or linkages? or could it just
be in need of an oil change?


thanks in advance

Andi
