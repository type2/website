Hey, I changed my email address for anyone who cares. Anyway, I have a little rust on the back of my bus underneath the bumper..not on the bumper but on the bus underneath. I have it in other places too but it is not that bad. Is there anything I can do about the rust? Any type of treatment I can use to keep it from getting worse? Any advice is appreciated. Please email me directly.

Thanks a lot,

Greg
