Subject: Re: Why can't people fix things right

Hi Folks,

Having followed this thread from the beginning, I wanted to weigh in with a 
few observations.  It seems to me that laziness, lack of money, lack of 
knowledge, and lack of vision all contribute to why people can't fix things 
right.  Here's how I see it:

Lack of Vision:  &quot;I needed a car, and my neighbor had this old 1960s VW Bus 
in his backyard, so I bought it for $200.  I don't know much about cars, and 
I hear these things need a lot of work, but it runs.  I'll drive it as long 
as I can, and buy something else when it dies.&quot;

Lack of Knowledge:  &quot;What do those red lights on my dash mean?  I never got 
an owner's manual, and the PO said they were supposed to be on when the 
engine's on.  You mean I have to change the oil?  But it's air-cooled!&quot;

Lack of Money:  &quot;Why buy a new wiring harness for $150 when I can buy a 
100-foot spool of wire at Radio Shack for $10?  I'll just replace the wires 
that need fixing, and it'll work okay until something else breaks.&quot;

Laziness:  &quot;I was going to fix the rust on my rockers last weekend, but it 
was raining, and the game was on, and then I got high, and by the time I 
woke up from my nap it was dark.  Besides, VW made these things pretty good 
anyway, so I can still drive it and fix the rust next summer.&quot;

If we're unfortunate enough to come across a Bus that has had POs with these 
lines of thinking, those of us who care about these great machines can get 
frustrated.  On the other hand, if we understand what we're doing to our 
Buses (for better or for worse) and are up-front with buyers at sale time, 
we only have ourselves to blame for future bad VW karma.  I've been guilty 
of all of the above infractions (on all of my cars), but I'm only human.

Best of luck to all who love, fix, and maintain these great old cars.
