Hi,

&gt; Do you or anyone else know how I can go about identifying the what style my
&gt; devon is?

 Hmm, I think the conversion names changed over time as well as what actually went into them. The names I've heard are Sundowner, Moonraker, Caravette and Eurovette. I think the Caravette and Eurovette were early-mid 70s with the Moonraker a higher spec. conversion that came out later. I don't know where the Sundowner fits in (lower spec. contemporary of Moonraker?).
 I've seen several different poptops on Devons, though they usually go straight up rather than being hinged like a Westy (early front, later rear) or a Dormobile (side). The Caravette my folks had in the mid '70s didn't have a poptop at all (their choice, most of them do).
 The Caravette has a double bed that is made up in the &quot;well&quot; by the sliding door by fitting the table between the seats to form a base. The Eurovette has a Z-bed arrangement (like a Westy) that folds up to form a rear seat.

 Hope this helps.

Cheers,
                 W.
