Subject: Re: [T2] Can't get it to run right cont'd

OK thanks so far for the suggestions..  I want to review them here for
clarity.

1) Wrong distributor -yes, I was told that this is for a 73 bus application
2) Maybe I've got TDC wrong -I will triple check today
3) Carb problems - entirely possible but it was running pretty well with the
timing advanced
4) I should be timing the engine based on the distributor - i.e. 10 degrees
ATDC at 800-950 RPM

When I put the strobe on the pulley and rev the engine the timing does
advance, this is how I've been setting the 27 degrees at 3400 RPM.  Again
the thing is that when I was using a different TDC point I essentially had
the timing much more advanced than I do now and it ran all right.  Does this
remove the carb as a possible source of my trouble?  Obviously it will need
some tweaking but can it be causing this problem now that I've presumably
got the timing right?  If I was running with the timing too far advanced
would this have burned the hole in my points I found?  Should I get a
different distributor or should I attempt to time my engine to 10 degrees
ATDC based on the distributor that I've got?  The thing is that at idle my
timing reads around 16 degrees right now and the lower I try to make it the
worse it seems to run!

I do intend to switch to dual carbs, I just don't have them right now. It
would be nice to know for sure that my timing is correct before I swap in
something else anyway.
