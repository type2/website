Subject: Re: [T2] Berg Temperature manual

I didn't say that he didn't know what he was talking about. I believe that 
99.9% of the time he is right on the mark. A little wearing to have anyone 
though - even an expert - tell you constantly that they are an expert.

Just a style of writing.

I like his stuff when i can afford it. I have the 5 speed shifter and want 
the tranny to go with it. I also have a few other small tidbits.

Little jewels in a world full of VW aftermarket JUNK &lt;insert stronger word 
here&gt;!!!

&gt;That is because Gene Berg pulled his own wrenches and had a lifetime of
&gt;working on VW's of the highest performance........he never stated anything
&gt;that extensive testing did not back up..............and his company does not
&gt;sell snake oil......they sell the highest quality parts that work.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there that deviates from the late Mr. Berg's experiences,
&gt;knowingly, does not know what he/she is doing!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; That would be the technical manuals.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; VERY good information but be ready for his opinion that he knows
&gt;EVERYTHING.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also he constantly refers to the parts his CO makes to solve the problem
&gt; &gt; referenced.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Still worthwhile in my opinion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Supposedly Berg has put together a manual of some sort on VW engines and
&gt;heat.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anybody bought this thing ?
&gt; &gt; &gt;Is it worth a flip ?
