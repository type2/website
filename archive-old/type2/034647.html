Subject: indicator  removal

Darren,
For the turn signals to come out you will have to
drill the rivet out,  at least that is what I had
to do on my 78.  For the headlight removal, follow
the wires under the dash.  You don't have to cut
anything all three wires just disconnect and then
you can pull all the wires out the front.

Good luck
Peace Brother,
