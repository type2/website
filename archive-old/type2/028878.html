Stephen,

I have had a few occasions to get to know these gauges. One thing you might
look is the vibrator or stabilizer. This is a metal box about 1 inch by 1/2
that stabilizes the voltage to the fuel gauge. This keeps the needle from
jumping around as the fuel splashes while driving turning ext. Always use
great caution when working with anything related to the fuel tank especially
anything that involves voltage, current, and resistance.

Subject: [T2] Fuel gauges


Hi Volks,

The recent gauges discussion got me thinking about the annoying
habit my fuel gauge has which I've been putting up with for a
while but I really should get sorted out.

When I first aquired my '76 Double Cab,just over 10 years ago
now,the fuel gauge would only ever read up to about the 1/4
mark when the tank was full then within a hundered kms or so,
dissappear off the gauge.

Tried new sender,made no difference.Had a spare instrument
clusted so swapped them over and now had a reliable fuel gauge,
...well,as accurate as they ever were.Never did really get to
the bottom of the root cause however...

All went well 'till a few months back when the current gauge developed
a mind of it's own.It has moments of lucidity when it will still
give an reasonable indication of fuel level,usually only when
I first start the truck but as you drive along,the needle starts
dropping and if the tank is half full or less,it starts to dissappear
again off the gauge.Also when I have a full tank of fuel,and turn
the ignition back on,the needle will jump about several times as it
attempts to pass the 1/4 mark before actually succeeding.

Given my problems are similar to what I experienced once before
and swapping sender units made no difference,could the voltage
stabilizer unit going kaput be likely to produce symptoms similar
to those I am experiencing?

Any insights appreciated,
