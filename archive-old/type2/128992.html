Subject: Beware of Matthew J. Ramsey

Hello folks,

I went to the effort to help this person, but he doesn't seem to be real 
or honest.  I looked thru the archives and found other times when he has 
requested something, but there was no response to the list about whether 
or not the items were received.  I am sorry to report than he has not 
delivered on his promise.  The money for the seat belts is bullsh*t - 
it's the promise to refund my shiiping charges that p*sses me off.  His 
posts are very irregular and always seem to want something.  I'm going 
thru Kansas later this year, and I WILL pay this a**hole a visit.

&gt; hi, just went out to check something.  the center seat's belts are 
&gt; about 4&quot;+ longer than the rear ones.  while one has the same 
&gt; attachment end pieces, the other has one slightly longer and not bent 
&gt; quite as much as the others (both of the clasp (short) ends mounted on 
&gt; the same bolt on top of each other in the middle of the seat).  i 
&gt; don't think it will be a problem, just wanted to mention it.  all of 
&gt; the rest of them including 3 rear that i took from my westy are 
&gt; identical (i'm making the bed perminent).  You choice, send me your 
&gt; address.  How does $20 shipped sound?

&gt; They would be the same as the rear seat belts from the Vanagon.  They 
&gt; bolt to the floor and come up through the seats.  Go Westy has a set 
&gt; that is Vanagon style retrofitted to the Bay.  I need two sets.  For 
&gt; the back of the DC.  If you have sets that are longer, those would be 
&gt; best as I'm strapping in kiddos one in a booster seat and the other 
&gt; in an infant seat.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for responding.

&gt; hi matthew, i have been stripping a '81 vanagon that has all of it's 
&gt; seat belts in pretty good shape.  i'm not sure what kind/size you're 
&gt; looking for on your double cab, but if you can tell me more, i'll be 
&gt; glad to send you some cheap - i have 5 sets, 3 for the rear seat and 
&gt; 2 for the center seat... (i'm near hagarstown, md)
