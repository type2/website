Subject: Re: [T2] oNCE AGAIN...THE TIRE/RIM CORUNDUM

How &quot;big&quot; are you going with the diameter of your tires? If you keep
&quot;+&quot;ing, maintaining the stock total tire diameter, there's no ENGINE
limitation. But if you go with a larger diameter that poor little 1800
is gonna be inadequate. Even a 2.0 may not have enough grunt to get
rolling or climb hills if you go big.

Lotsa baja busses had to go with large water cooled engines to get the
power to move large offroad tires.

Another thing that has been discussed a few times (but without hard
data to prove one way or the other), a wider tire may cause a roll in
emergency maneuvers that would result in skidding on narrower tires.
Vehicles with a high center of gravity, like our busses, don't
necessarily benefit from wide sticky tires.

The sidewall weight rating and stiffness needs have already been
discussed ad nauseum.

There are plenty of wheels that will fit our busses and accept the
stock sized tires. I have a set of Carroll Shelby snowflake rims from
the 80's in my garage right now... 14x5.5
