Craig, you wrote:

&gt;I started to take a good look at my distributor.
&gt;It is a 009, I assume it to be German. 

That can be verified by pulling it and looking at the bottom, it
should tell you it's German if it's German.

&gt;part # 0 231 178 009,

Correct, btw, there are a lot more Bosch distributors which PN ends with 009

&gt;also stamped Z 42 and (050).

Dono what these are for, maybe batch numbers...

&gt;The rotor is black plastic, part# 1 234 332 215, 

The black ones are not so common (to me here in Holland) the number is 
identical to the (to me) more common rust colored ones the number is 
correct for any aircooled VW with the 'high' distributor cap, without 
electronic ignition and which doesn't require a rev limiting rotor.
I would advise to use the somewhat more expensive rev limiting rotor,
email me for details.

&gt;stamped &quot;.08&quot; 

Dono what that means,

&gt;and(R5).

Resistance is 5 Ohm, some of the H20 rotors will fit your aircooled VW,
but it could be they are only 1 Ohm, if so, don't use them.
