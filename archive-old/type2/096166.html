&gt; My 79 westy crapped out on me today and I have a cross country move
&gt; planned very soon.  I was driving on 101 south and it just started
&gt; loosing power.  Then I saw a lot of smoke and the exhaust sounded
&gt;  really loud.

hmmmmmm,  hole in piston, burned valve?, loose valve train, rockers
etc.  dist slipped?

&gt; hot.  I checked the oil and it was surprisingly low considering I had

how hot is &quot;really hot&quot;?

&gt; dino.  Then I tried to start it and it started, but didn't seem to
&gt; have enough pick up to join the traffic and get off the exit about 5
&gt; feet ahead. finally got it going and made it to my dates house.  The
&gt; pickup sucked. It sounds like the exhaust is really loud, but I'm not
&gt; sure if that is what is actually making the noise.  Also, checked the
&gt; vacum hoses and seemed ok, but will check again.Tryin to get home

probably not hoses

&gt; took me over an hour and 20 minutes.  When I finally got it home I
&gt; took a look under the car. oil everywhere.  I know my pushrod tube

&gt; heater box and white boot thingy on the drivers side.  Passenger side

deffinately sounds like a problem on the 3/4 side, probably 3

&gt; not as bad though except for where the push rod tubes leak.  I have 3
&gt; days before I leave for a week vacation (the bus will sit for this
&gt; week)  The day after I get back I leave for a cross country move
&gt; during which the bus will definitely not be sitting.  And I'm supposed
&gt; to meet my date again in 3 hours!

option #1    call date and cancel, cancel vacation, rebuild or fix engine
option #2    rent U-haul and trailer, tow bus to NC
option #3    pray, and start saving your $$ for new engine, make sure AAA
is paid up, probably won't make it over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, no
way the rockies

sorry BTDT, hope it is something simple
