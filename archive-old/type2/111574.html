Subject: Setting of the valves?

I've allways set my exaust valves on my 73 bus to 0.008 in. (0.20mm)
Because my 1973 bus Chassiis #(2232005974) is larger than the #2132210554.

I have read that all made after # 2132210554 have the sodum exaust valves and use the larger setting.

However I have been pondering this for a while.

If the firt two numbers only represent the model.(22 being the Microbus)
and the next the year 3 = 1973 in my case.

then the remaining numbers being its order in production.
Then my remainining number (2005974) is smaller than 2210554.
So now I am thinking I should be setting my exaust valves to 0.006in (0.15mm)


If someone could confirm this for me or set me straight please do.

Thanks 
Jason
