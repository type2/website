 Being hyd lifter illiterate, are you suppose to hear lifters tapping like
on non hyd systems?

Thanks in advance!

I say:

Hi Art,

Hydraulic lifters will make a fair bit of noise when you first fire up a
newly rebuilt engine until they &quot;pump up&quot; that is until they get full of oil
and lift up to the required height.... those first few seconds sound
terrible but when they pump up the engine should quieten down a whole heap.
Also when the engine sits for a while you may get some tappet noise until
the lifters &quot;pump up&quot; again, this should only be for a second or two as
well.

Cheers
Steve
