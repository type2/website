&gt; Ken is absolutley right *if* you have a carb engine.  On the FI tanks,
&gt; tho, there is no such filter.  The two taps are (at least in my '78 tank)
&gt; welded in place.  If you have FI and see no threaded fitting, then you
&gt; gotta pull the tank to clean it as there is no filter in the tank.

I'll second and third that one!  My dad and I got bit by it on a rainy
night heading out fishing.  My dad's '77 CALIFORNIA (IE unleaded fuel
only nozel restriction) Westy had a piece of the restrictor break off
and drop into the tank.  We got it going by opening the pressure tap
and heard a &quot;thunk&quot; in the tank as the suction released the piece of
rubber over the fuel line.  We used it as an excuse to go ahead and
pull the engine and replace the clutch and rear main seal and then fix
the tank.

OH!  One thing we did was put a stainless steel ball valve in the line 
to turn off the gas when replacing the gas filter or pump!

For the 2 of us, it was about a 3 hour job, total.
