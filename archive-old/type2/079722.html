Subject: Re: [T2] Engine replacement (long)

&gt; try to buy a spanking new engine (not sure 
the cost on that or the best sources) 

This month's HVW has an add from Cal Imports boasting
of new &quot;zero mile vanagon engine 79-83 long block new
factory engine&quot; for $1995 + shipping. 
http://www.cip1_dot_com or 1-800-313-3811.  

Note:  I didn't see these on the website.  Also, these
are sqare port heads, so if you don't have a 79 you'll
have exhaust issues to deal with at the very least. 
If you are buying a new exhaust anyway, maybe it
doesn't matter much.
