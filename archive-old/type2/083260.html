Subject: Re: [T2] 78 Rabbit front end and a 72 Bus back end

Hello List,
My first thought after complete shock and horror was,
What is in the REAR engine compartment???? Do you
suppose that he connected the nose of the bus to the
rear of the Rabbit as well???? He might as well have
just left the rabbit the way it was and pulled  around
a dead bus. Any way, That is what I thought.

Later,
David Kelly

&gt;  It is the front
&gt; &gt; end of a 78 Rabbit and the back end of a 72 Bus. 
&gt; It looks like
&gt; &gt; someone did a nice job on it.  It's not mine and I
&gt; do not know
&gt; &gt; anything about it.
