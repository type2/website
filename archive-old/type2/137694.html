 I just finished installing a CDI from Aircooled_dot_net today. This also
 included new plugs and wires. When I fired her up to check it out this
 afternoon, she drove great. After maybe .75 miles or so my GEN light
 came on. After I saw that my belt was plenty tight, I headed for home.
 Someone please help me diagnose as I have no idea. Is this mere
 coincidence that my Generator goes kaput exactly after I put in the CDI?
 For some reason I doubt it.
 
 How does one test a generator? Would this be a good time for a
 alternator upgrade?? Suggestions welcome.
 Thanks
