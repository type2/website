Subject: Found suppleir of VDO oil pressure sender hose

Previously I had reported that the VDO-150-752 Oil pressure sender extension
hose was no longer available. I was wrong. :~P  After hunting relentlessly for
some parts for the shift linkage for my 80 Vanagon, I stumbled on the hose at
http://www2.cip1_dot_com/SearchResults.asp?Search=vdo-150-752&lt;http://www2.cip1.co
m/SearchResults.asp?Search=vdo-150-752&gt;. :~)

These guys are not my favorite vendor, but when I know I am getting a name
brand part from them, I don't mind doing business with them. Some of the stuff
that doesn't have the brand listed in the description is JUNK and some is ok.
So Buyer Beware.

When I receive the kit I'll Let you know if it is the VDO kit or some other
junk.
