Subject: Re: [T2] RE:  914 motor into a bus (was 0mile engine)

&gt;I think the Porsche engine makes so much more power primarily because of a)

&gt;higher compression and b) more aggressive camshaft profile, but I have no 
&gt;proof of that either so I put it forth as opinion only.  :)

I dug around a little bit and I'm certain that the 914 motors (1.7, 1.8,
2.0) use the exact same cam which is the exact same cam as the 72-77
non-hydrualic bus motors.  It is my belief that the difference in HP is due
in part to the bigger valves, but as you well know, bigger valves don't mean
didly unless the engine can breathe.

I've been pondering the differences in my 914's engine characteristics vs my
bus's engine characteristics.  Both are completely stock 914 2.0 motors with
the exact same FI system.  I've even gone so far as to swap virtually every
FI component from one to the other.  And still the fact remains:  the motor
in the bus just won't rev like the one in the 914.

I can barely get the bus motor up to 5000 rpm while I'm contantly bouncing
off the 5400 RPM rev-limiter in the 914.  At first I thought it was just due
to the extra weight in the bus, but that would not explain why, sitting
still with the cars out of gear, I can rev the 914 and it whips up and down
from 1000-5000-1000 RPM in much less time than it takes the bus to wind up
and down (say maybe 1 second vs nearly 2 seconds).  

My (as yet unsubstantiated) conclusion is that the stock 73 bus exhaust
system is too restrictive for the motor.  What else could it be?  Both
engines have close to the same compression ratio (ranging from 125 - 135).
Any idea how one could home-test the breathability of an exhaust system?
Something like assemble the heat exchangers and muffler, plug 3 of the four
manifold openings, blow air through and measure the resistance somehow?

BTW, when I rebuilt my orignal 1.7 bus motor years and years ago, I ordered
a pair of Mark Stephens heads.  I was re-using the cylinders because they
had been replaced by the PO's mechanic (for $1200!!!) only a few thousand
miles earlier.  Boy was I surprised when I found my 1.7 heads wouldn't fit
the cylinders.  Seems they had put 1.8 cylinders on it.  So I had my heads
machined to fit.  What I ended up with was the much smaller valves for a 1.7
with the bigger cylinders of the 1.8.  I had KILLER low-end torque in that
thing (running dual Webers of course).  I could get pretty respecatble
squeals out of my tires when taking off and could even get a nice chirp
going into 2nd.  Tons of fun on rain-slick streets having that tail wagging
around!  I attribute the low-end power to the smaller valves.
