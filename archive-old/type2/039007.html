Subject: Re: Valve spring broken

Dallas:
to replace a valve spring in situ:
buy a valve spring compressor (sears or flaps)
that works from outside only ( screw-type)
and 6 feet of 1/4 inch plastic rope.

set cylinder at top of stroke
where both valves are closed ( at the adjustment
location for a solid cam engine, or opposite
rotor mark for cylinder fire.

disconnect battery.

remove spark plug, feed in rope, filling
cylinder will push valve head and hold it.
if piston moves, turn fan by hand a little.

install spring and keepers. remove rope.

simple. problems? buzz me.
