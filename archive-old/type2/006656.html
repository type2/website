Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Progressive carb on `77 BUS

Never have icing with icing on dual carbs..

A big resason that progressives Ice is the fact that al the air is being
inducted at a very high  speed, most of the time through on 26mm venturi,
the faster the air, the colder it gets from the process..Most icing I have
experienced came at night, or early morning, when it was damp out, and I
have even experienced it during the summer, after a hug T storm when
conditions rapidly changed...

The progressive being center mounted, over the crankcase, with long thin
runners even makes it wworse...My little 80 dolar part will stop all those
icing problems....

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I know lots'o folks on the list have had bad luck or just plain hate the
&gt; &gt; Weber Progressive setup.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not me! I ran one on my '77 Westy for 4 years without a problem...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ...Cold weather may cause carb icing - there is no heat riser. This
could be a
&gt; &gt; big issue. I only run my bus in the 'better' half of the year so it was
not
&gt; &gt; an issue with me.
&gt;
&gt; A piece of data for carb icing fanatics:
&gt;
&gt; Carb icing does not require cold temperatures and in fact cannot occur at
temperatures below freezing.  As air goes through a carburator
&gt; it is sent through a venturi which increases the speed of the air and,
courtesy of Daniel Bernoulli, lowers the pressure.  Lower pressure,
&gt; according to another chap named Charles, means lower temperature.  Air
goes into the carb at, say, 55F and is sped up in the venturi.
&gt; The temperature of the air drops to 30F at which point any moisture in the
air will condense out and freeze into ice.  If the ice starts to
&gt; build up, you end up with the problem called carb icing.
&gt;
&gt; The idea that carb icing is most serious from 50F to 70F is drummed into
the head of any student pilot, since airplanes have manual
&gt; carburator heat controls.  Part of the landing checklist is to turn on the
carb heat as you approach the runway so that the carb won't ice
&gt; up during the descent and then not respond with power if the pilot decides
to go around.
&gt;
&gt; On my '71 (with dubious heat riser condition), use the hot air tube and
wire the flap in the &quot;hot&quot; position during the mild SoCal winter.  This
&gt; improves drivability and I haven't had any icing problems.  If I were
running a higher compression engine I'd be very sensitive to
&gt; detonation, as the hotter intake air could cause it.  On my MexiMotor this
isn't a problem at all.
&gt;
&gt; George Lyle
&gt;
&gt; The cure for this is either to heat the part of the carb and intake
manifold to melt the ice, or to heat the intake air so that icing conditions
&gt; are never created.  VW uses both of these approaches on carbed engines,
but on a single Weber conversion the heat riser isn't present.  I
&gt; don't think that there is much icing problems with dual webers since the
intake manifolds are short and heated directly by the heads.
