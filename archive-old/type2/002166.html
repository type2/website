Subject: Uh Oh...Tight Crank

Well it seems that my PEAA (Pre Engine Assembly Anxiety) was there for a
reason.

After double and triple checking the conents of the shortblock (1600 SP),
the halves went together...and nicely.
But after torqing down the case studs and main bearing
studs...retorqing...and checking again, it seems to me that the crank is too
tight.
I used moly on the bearings, all of which went in fine.  I noticed that one
of the cam bearing halves had a collar on it and the others did not.  Does
it matter wich case half receives this bearing?  The camshaft had zero
backlash, and stayed in place when I turned the crank.

Before I tear this thing open again, have I missed anything?  Anything I
should check?  Is it normal for a bit of resistance from the crank since
there is no *oil* on the bearings?
Could I have put too much grease on the bearings thus causing binding?

Any observations and suggestions would be great.
