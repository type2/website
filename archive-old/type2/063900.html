Subject: Re:'67 Resto update/B. Willis Q's

The inquisitive Budd Willis asked:
*What did you cut the paneling with?  Is there a special fine toothed saw
you use so you don't rip the edges?
*What about curtains?  Do you have a source for the (stock) material?  Is it
the same checkered pattern as the breadloafs or were they white prior to '78?
*Sounds like your panelling job came of fairly inexpensively, is that true?
*What was total cost for all pieces with Fontana purchased birch. That
lumber yard is real close by me and I'd love to follow your footsteps if it
worked out good for you.  Thanks.

VanBondo surmises:
Most of the answers could benefit the list...

Um, I intentionally remeasured every piece just so that I didn't waste the
wood. Yeah, if you want to use the existing panels as a pattern go for it
but put it (the old one) back into place and really check how it fits first.
If its off (or messed up) then note exactly HOW and where it's off. My last
sentence makes it sound more complicated than it really is. Basically, just
check it all out before you do it to it. Then use the *measurements* from
the old panels. Tracing the panels could and probably will throw off the
size of the new panels. I did trace some of the panels but made allowances
for the off set. Remember, you can always make the pieces smaller. You can't
realistically make them bigger once cut. I drew my guidelines on the BACK
side of the wood using the BACK side of the old as a guide (either tracing
or measuring). I also put masking tape on both sides of the wood where the
blade would go zooming through. The tape kinda holds the little wood grains
in place- kinda like a weight lifters belt for wood ;-) if ya know what I mean?
I used an old 9foot solid core door that I scavaged as my &quot;Bench.&quot; I had to
use C clamps to hold the wood into place when I cut it. If you do this place
another piece of clean wood on top of your good wood so as to not dinge it
when you honk down on the (tighten) clamp. I found that clamping the &quot;good&quot;
side down also helped hold the grains into place. So what if the hidden side
is a little ragged. You will be like driving down the road secretly thinking
that only *you* know the back side of the wood is hosed! hahahaha...
The two saws were a Skill saw with a blade for cutting Formica and laminates
etc. The reciprocating scroll &quot;jig&quot; saw (as in cutting wood for jigsaw
puzzles) was fitted with a very fine blade. Take the masking tape off of the
wood carefully and only when you are ready to stain it. when you remove the
tape, peel it from the edge closest to the center of the wood and peel
toward the cut edge. Work your way down the length of the cut. Don't just
grab the tape and, like, rip it off without thinking. In a good wood shop a
table saw would have been the ticket. I don't live with Norm Abrahams at the
New Yankee Workshop. (bummer)
Before cutting the wood double check exactly where the blade is going to cut
the wood. Do NOT assume that the blade will be right on your mark. Look at
it be closely before cutting! Measure several times, check alignment of
everything several times and cut once. Remember that a wood file of the
proper type can reduce dimensions in fine increments if needed later.
**Saftey first~!**
1. Keep your fingers out of the way!
2. Use proper eye protection.
3. Consider and use face mask for your lungs
4. Keep your fingers out of the way some more!!!

Curtains:
This is where I let the little missus do her thing. She found some material
that pleased her and she just went for it. We picked a black material with a
zillion teeny little green frogs on it. Makes the curtain look green not
black (ie RGB dots on a black TV field). Kinda like a total frog orgy. All
69ing and stuff. Pretty funny. It's not rude but they are mooshed together
like frogs in a box. Looks like a pattern until you check it out. Cherry
VanBondo has the dimensions and detailed yardage info all written out. It
would take forever to put it on the email list. I will eventually create a
MS word doc with illustrations etc. Mrs. VanBondo chose to make both sides
of the curtain material the &quot;out&quot; side. This means that they are double
thickness, back to back and hemmed together. She did an excellent job!
I recently checked with my local VW dealer about '68 curtains which were
supposed to be still available. Word was that These curtains could be made
to work in a splitty bus. No luck and they were supposed to be mondo
expensive if they existed.

Lumber Costs:
If I lived right near that lumber place I would be all over it. The wood was
great!! Check through the sheets to make sure that there aren't any little
imperfections like knot holes and stuff. Remember its YOUR money that you
are spending. Be polite, and the guy at the store will understand. Tell him
the dude from the internet in Arizona sent you. It will freak him out! =)
Actual cost was $8.90 per sheet times the number of sheets that you want.
That is a SCREAMING bargain. The place in Phoenix wanted $21.00 for a 4'x4'
piece (each)!!!! Thanks again to Synchrohead Jim Davis &amp; Family.
