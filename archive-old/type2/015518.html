This could be just the rear shoes needing adjustment, or it could be the MC
full of crud and varnish, or just air in the lines.

Flush and bleed the old fluid/air out of the brakes before driving further.
If that doesn't bring the pedal up, inspect all seals for leaks. If black
crud comes out of the bleeders, rebuild or replace all cylinders and
calipers. Look over those flex hoses as well. Then flush/bleed the fluid
every year as standard maintenance. Don't let the varnish and crud get
started.

&gt;G'Morning Folks,
&gt;Everything went pretty well, only problem I noticed was brake pedal travels 
&gt;further than I feel it should, pumping helps a bit (master cylinder?) but in 
&gt;several &quot;panic&quot; type stops it stops well, no pulling to either side. 

What we don't know is what was up there that DID fly off. Reminds me to
check all my tools after every procedure so I don't send a $50 wrench down
the road in a client's car. I lose a tool or two every year that way.
