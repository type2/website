Subject: Carb

Had a moment to look over the Bus today, and took off the carb.  It is a 2
barrel, but with no name.  How can I tell who made it?  Is there another
carb I can put in using the same runners?  What do you think it would cost
to put it back to fuel injection?

Also, the seal around the engine looks in good shape, but it is dry and
flaky.  What can I put on it to keep it from crumbling away?
