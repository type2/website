Subject: Re: [T2] Engine ate part of my carb

Timo,

I have worked on two engines(both T1's) that had eaten this part.

When it does it at low speed, it sounds like you have a thrown rod.
At hight speed, who knows?  If the engine runs good and makes now weird 
noises, then it may have already been missing for some time, or maybe ate 
it at hight speed...it is made out of brass and can get chewed up pretty 
quickly as long as it doesn't hang up in a valve...

If it is like the t1 accelerator pump nozzles, then it is a press fit.

I use a square punch and locktite to put it in.  Guess what I do every 
time I have a new or unknown carb...I check this part and pound it in
with the punch.

Get the part, pull the carb, and put it in....check your other one and 
tighten anyway.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; rpm's). Upon closer inspection I noticed that the small bent tube which
&gt; injects the gas (&quot;Einspritzroehrchen&quot; in german, see item # 26
&gt; (http://vwbus.dyndns_dot_org/bulli/michaelk/vw_bus_d/fiche/t201410.gif) ) on the
&gt; left carb was gone.
&gt; 
&gt; Now my questions:
&gt; Is it very likely that the tube damaged the engine (replacement engine,
&gt; 10.000 miles on it)? (It still runs surprisingly good even without it.)
&gt; Is there a way to replace it? (Do I need some special tools, because I think
&gt; it's pressed in the carb)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks a lot,
&gt;
