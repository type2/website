&gt;inadvertently left my rear engine door open.  Oil temp gauge read 20
&gt;degrees cooler for about 20 minutes

I thought every one did that.  If I go on long trips in the summer I always
leave it open.  I do use a screen for the fan though.  Always runs cooler.
Just remember you hide the license plate when you do this so can get pulled
at any time.

Peace
