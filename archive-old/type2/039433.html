Subject: Re: damaged nose on '79

Gary:

I haven't replaced the nose on my bus yet, but I think I get the prize
for research in the meantime.

Also, you might do the interim fix:

Kelly's bodywork page in the library is awesome.

If I get a new nose, I'll go with Bus Depot for $139.00 (plus shipping,
remember). I haven't yet decided if I'm going to get a new nose or find
a donor bus. The advantage to the donor bus isn't just the monetary
savings (which aren't that significant), but you get replacement
ductwork and stuff that might also have been damaged by the impact.
However, depending on where you are located, finding a rust-free used
nose may be difficult.

Either way, the cost estimate I keep hearing is $1000-$1500 for the job.

&gt; I just purchased a '76 campmobile in pretty fair
&gt; condition.  The nose panel around the passenger's side
&gt; headlight is pushed in pretty badly and it will need
&gt; to be repaired before I can put it on the road. There
&gt; is also a lot of rust at the seal along the lower edge
&gt; of the windsheild. Rather than repair the body damage
&gt; and be left with the rust, I was consierding replacing
&gt; the whole nose panel. California Imports sells the
&gt; nose panel for less than $200.
&gt; 
&gt; I realize the panel will need to be welded in place
&gt; however I don't really have an appreciation as to how
&gt; easy or difficult the panel replacement will be. I
&gt; plan to have a body shop do the work in either case.
&gt; 
&gt; I would appreciate it if anyone who has replaced the
&gt; nose panel would provide me with their advise on doing
&gt; a repair vs a replacement.
