Yeah, buy a case of 500 geckos and release them inside your camper.  They
will lick all of the condensation off of the windows.

Oops, it's not Friday.  :-)

I have the same problem, and haven't yet found a solution.  For the rear
window which is right by my head when I'm sleeping, I sometimes tuck some
paper towels (or a real towel) underneath the curtains to absorb the
condensation.  I know you said &quot;besides a towel&quot; but I think I'm using it
in a different way than you were talking about.
