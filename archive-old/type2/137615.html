Subject: RE: brake booster line

&quot;What it
does is this,  you hit the brakes, they are high and stiff, but barely work. &quot;

This is a good description of boosted brakes when the booster doesn't work!

I still need to know what the internal diameter of the brake booster hose 
is. I've seen both 15/32&quot; and 1/2&quot; in the archives. I presume the original 
was metric (12mm?). Any suggestions?

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
