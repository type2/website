&gt; What hate most is the &quot;critical needs detector circuit&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; This morning, I needed to get to the beach.  As a result, the bus, which
&gt; has been performing well for months and just got an oil change and tune
&gt; up... won't start.  It has been raining here for the last 24 hours, and
&gt; the ground is a bog.  I *don't* want to crawl under the bus!  I just want
&gt; to go to the beach and for traffic reasons, I would like to leave before
&gt; noon and *have* to leave before 2:30 or else spenbd 3-5 hours in traffic
&gt; instead of 2 1/2 hours.
&gt; 
&gt; crank bus, no dice,
&gt; battery may be low? put on charger, let it sit and charge for 2 hours,

&gt; clock passes 2:30PM, traffic jam starts,
&gt; crank, starts and runs like a baby.

heard the traffic report, ten mile back up at the bridge....

&gt; I HATE the critical needs detector circuit!!!!!!!

I sure would like to eliminate this part on my bus!! 

&gt; See you all on Sunday, I am off to the beach, slowly :-(

enjoy it when you get there......
