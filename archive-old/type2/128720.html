Subject: Re: [T2] scrapping a bus (was steel prices)

I took my trusty Sawz-all and cut the bus in half and then in half again (quarters) and then put it on my little 5x8 utility trailer. 

Our local scrapyard requires the tires and gas tanks to be removed. 

Are you taking it to a scrap yard or a junkyard? I know many junkyards will haul it away on a flat bed truck for free if they don't have to go too far. Our scrapyard requires you to bring it to them.
