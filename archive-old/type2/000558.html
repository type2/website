Subject: downshifting?
Message-ID: &lt;000201becba7$3880e1a0$a6ab8318_at_USER.ce.mediaone_dot_net&gt;

what are the pros and cons to downshifting? i know some people who drive and
downshift to a stop every time? why? i just throw it in neutral and cost to
a stop. less wear and tear on clutch and stuff right? Hmmm? I hate stick
driving and downshifting is like doing double duty.
