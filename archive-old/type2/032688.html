Subject: RE: [VB] VANDALIZED/need tail light lenses

&gt; I am hoping someone can hook me up with a better price than $20.00
&gt; each for tail light lenses that seems to be the going rate new. These
&gt; are the red oval lenses, used from 62-71.



My going rate is $4.95 each for lenses.  $20 would get you a whole assembly,
lenses, housings, seals, and all.
