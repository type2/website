A big Thank You! to all that responed to my question. I really love this 
list! I'm still gathering info to help me decide which route I'll take with a rebuild. My bus is not a daily driver so I have some time.
Again, Thanks!

&gt;Hey Volks, 
&gt;How much should I expect to pay for a decent type 4 
&gt;engine case? 1.7, 1.8 or 2.0 ? I currently have a 1.7L 1972 
&gt;Type 4 in my bus but it needs work and I'm thinking of building 
&gt;up my own long block. Any thoughts or input would be appreciated. 
&gt;Thanks, 
&gt;Jeff and The Frijole Grande (with one rod a knockin')
