Subject: Twin Cities (MN) Volkswagen Club 14th Annual Show
Content-Disposition: inline

Like the subject says, this is to announce the TCVWC's Annual Show.  It will be Sunday 11 June at Westside Volkswagen in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota from 9:00 am to 3:00pm.  Admission is $3.00 per adult or $5.00 for show car entry and and admission.  I usually go for the $5.00 but this year I don't have the Syncro.  Westside VW is just south of I394 on the east side of County Road 100.

Hope to see you there!
