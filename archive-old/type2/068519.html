&gt;Thats me !!
&gt;
&gt;Well, um, actually I have a type 3 !!  However I find useful mech stuff
&gt;here, and am thinking of pushing the squareback into a convenient river
&gt;and getting either a beetle or a bus.  My biggest gripe with the type3 is
&gt;cooling troubles. 
&gt;
&gt;However a question :
&gt;What sort of fuel economy do people get out of the normally aspirated
&gt;upright motors (say a 71) around town and on the highway?  Are there
&gt;big differences between motor sizes?  Reading Bob's sermons, CDI seems
&gt;the way to go.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

 Personally I like the looks of the square-back.

 I really like the pancake engine setup altho I have to admit it looks
a tight package.

 Still, I think if it's done right it would be no worse than a 
Beetle.

 I'm planning a t3 engine for my 72 van. The flat pack will look good
in there. Be a dream to work on.

 Even the upright I'm building now will have the t3 lower &quot;cooling tin&quot; on it.

 The biggest problem I see with the type 3 is always ignorance and neglect.

 If that engine isn't sealed right, it pulls every bit of 
road dirt right into the fins and plugs them up fast.

 The oil cooler gets it first.

 Mileage can be anything from say 30us mpg to 15 depending on what 
you got , where you drive and how old you are.

 Mileage is  proportional to the drivers age.  :-)
