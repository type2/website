Subject: Timing a unique engine.

So I am seeking some advice on timing my new engine setup.

I've got a freshly built 2L with Dual Kadrons and an Aircooled_dot_net  
SVDA with Petronix and I have been mulling over  my timing and would  
like your suggestions !

After a jaunt across town the oil temp hit 220 while chugging along  
and the block was definitely hot to the touch. I think my Cylinder  
head temp gauge isn't wired correctly because it didn't read anything  
so I will look at that. She ran smoothly though a tad gutless. I was  
thinking that perhaps my timing was out as I checked mixture and  
jetting on the carbs and that seems to be right.

Anyways, I would love input on what a good timing would be !

Thanks
Steve
