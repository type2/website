Subject: Cuts out after running a short while

Hi gang:

This Saturday I'm heading out to Dog Island, Fla. to work on a late 
70's bus belonging to some friends who own a house there.

Dog Island is a real throwback and I hope it stays that way.  One of 
the few inhabited-but-not-bridged islands left in this overpopulated 
state.  There's a ferry -- a forty-foot boat for foot traffic only.  
The ferryman also own an old WWII LST that can carry your car out.

But no one uses that, except when their current &quot;island car&quot; 
succumbs to rust.  When you arrive at the dock on the island, you see 
what looks like a junkyard -- but it's where the island's few hundred 
residents leave their cars parked until they return from off-island.  
We're talking post-apocalyptic car park here, with a predominance of 
VWs and many vehicles sans windshields, doors, etc.  There are no 
paved roads on the island, no stores, one 8-room hotel, and a garbage 
dump.  It's freakin' heaven, man.

Anyway, their bus is an automatic with FI.  The gang says it starts 
fine but cuts out after a few minutes.  I'm taking tools and basic 
tune-up parts (plugs, rotor, condenser, points) to give it a 
look-see.  I don't want to touch the FI because it scares me :).  Any 
pointers would be greatly appreciated.

BTW a very kind fellow by the name of Helmut in Dusseldorf just sent 
me a raft of cool images of various tents attached to some very 
late-model campers.  Maybe before Christmas I'll have them up on the 
tent pages.
