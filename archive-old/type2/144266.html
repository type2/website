Subject: Re: [T2] Why would a valve guide be leaving small bits in the 
  valve cover?

What has happened is that the head has been overheated
and the guide is galling(flaking out in pieces)the
guide and valve will have to be replaced, I would
suggest having the whole head reworked. Also with the
overheated heads check the springs they will also go
bad(will be weak)under extreme heat. Phil
