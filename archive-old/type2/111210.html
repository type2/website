Subject: splitty rewire in seattle/Tacoma Wa

A friend has a splitty converted to 12v. Installed
a radio... it died.. she got it fixed.. had a 
bit of a smoker happen under the dash and nothing
has been the same after that.
  Question: Anyone know of a good Sparky type in the
Seattle-Tacoma area who could either install a new
harness or fix the existing wiring?
  I'll pass the info on to her..
Thanks a bunch!~
