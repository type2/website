Subject: Re Leaded--to--Unleaded

Right on! VW motors have no problemo with unleaded fuel--we went thru this in
Phoenix years ago--BUT--some of the additives CAN eat thru your gas lines!! If
your area is going into Unleaded--please up grade you gas lines--There were
several fires due to the unleaded additives eating up our gas lines--Please play
it safe--TWWM, uj
