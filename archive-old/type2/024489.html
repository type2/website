&gt;  Have you actually ever converted an old R12 system
&gt;  that worked more than a year without leaking?  My
&gt;  hunch is the conversion kits are for those gullible
&gt;  enough to think that conversion is a simple process. 
&gt;  I believe cars up through 1993 used R12, and all newer
&gt;  cars use R134A.
&gt;  
My Volvo was converted five years ago.  No leaks.  Works great.  The Ozone 
and my son are happy and I have a clear conscience.
