Subject: Re: [T2] Question about normal running oil temperature

 I bought a digital meat thermometer from Target. I made an extension wire that allows me to place the probe in place of my dipstick and the meter up on my dash. I tested it with boiling water and it was accurate. I rarely see temps over 210F. On the highway at 70 or so on a hot day, I may see 230F. 

I do not know if it is the most exactly perfect location for determining the average oil temperature. But if my engine begins to overheat, I will know immediately. 

Plus, it only cost me $20, and is a great laugh, and I can bring it in the house and use it for cooking.
