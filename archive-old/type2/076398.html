&gt; Hiya Grant,
&gt;
&gt; Like so many other parts on our Busses the particulars of your spare tire
&gt; hold-down device will depend on the production year of your Bus.
&gt;
&gt; George sent you a description of the securing system for later Baywindows.
&gt; In the earlier models (mine is a 70) the securing system consisits of two
&gt; pieces.  One is a convoluted bolt which threads through a plate.  The
plate
&gt; holds the wheel in place while the bolt is run into the side of the body
and
&gt; screwed tight
.
secured!!!

&gt; Truth be told, I've been operating without either the bolt or the plate
and
&gt; everything is just fine.  The tire does not wiggle around, make noise, or
&gt; pose any threat of escaping.

Wishful thinking!

Speaking from experience of having survived three major accidents in bay
window busses (1. Hitting a cow 2. Complete rollover on a turn, and 3. A
rear end collision by a 1 ton truck)  What ever you are carrying (even if
its being held down securely) will be trying to get air borne, and possibly
make it through your windshield.
