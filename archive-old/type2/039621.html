Subject: Rear Sway Bar installation/location

I've just ordered a sway bar kit from John Connolly at Aircooled_dot_net.  Great 
price, easy to deal with.  But I suddenly realized I may have an installation 
problem with the rear bar due to the 5speed transmission transplant I performed 
last fall.

So, could someone that has installed the rear Sway-a-way bar please tell me 
where the mounting points for the sway bar are and if the bar itself runs 
directly underneath the rear torsion tube (or where it does run)?

Thanks!!
