Subject: Re: [T2] Excellent tune up

&gt; My dealer did a tune up of my van that was excellent, I cannot figure out
&gt; what they did right.
&gt;
&gt; My fuel economy was the best I have ever seen and my power was the best I
&gt; have ever seen.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone help me out here?
&gt;
&gt; I usually adjust for 7.5 deg BTC at 975 rpm. idle.

What engine and distributor do you have? Where did the dealer set the
timing to?
