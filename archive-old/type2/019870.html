his is definitely a Friday topic! Whatever happened to the brave souls
who trekked across America in their trusty(G!) rusty VW splitties,
having paid 200. or so for them, did a valve adjustment and oil
change/tune up, and were off to see the Wizard? I was one of them,
having purchased a '65 squareback for $100.00 from a native of
washington, D.C.(in 1969!). He gave me the kits for the carbs, a new
battery and a set of brake shoes also. I rebuilt the carbs, kinda
synched them by ear(had to readjust every 200 mi. or so)and proceeded to
the Grand Canyon via I-40 and so on. We got to see the Canyon(Kaibab
trail at night, both ways!), the back road down to Phoenix(listening to
the Navaho radio station all the way) and stayed around Ft. mcDowell
res. for a week. Then the Square developed a real nasty grinding noise
and I had to sell it, for 100bux! The motor never gave us any real
trouble, just kept on humming along. Im knew virtually nothing about all
the stuff we discuss on this list, having only a Peterson's manual to
read when there was a lighted stopover! Miss those days!?!

My .o21/2.

Chris.
