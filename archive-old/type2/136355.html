Subject: [T2]adding toggle to starting battery

okso maybe this is a silly question but if i wanted to add a toggle switch to my starting battery how would i do so?
 
in other words = be able to add the toggle to where i could even have my key turned on _at_ignition and not get anythign till i flipped the toggle switch.
 
this way if there is anythign draining my battery while the key is not turned it wont be able to drain it cause the action will be interupted key on or off.
 
reason i am still having a battery drain went to go to in laws on christmas eve and battery was dead jumped off and ran fine.
stuck to charger at folks house and was needing bad cjarge so decided to install a toggle in between the switch and battery or in between the fuse panel and battery stopping current at my will to geting from battery....?
 
shouldnt be that hard but want to make sure first.
 
peace and love and thanks
hope everyone had a great christmas and best wishes on the upcoming new year.
want to drink and drive?
go camping and sit behind the wheel of the bus and pretend. LOL
 
Chris
 


Peace and Love
