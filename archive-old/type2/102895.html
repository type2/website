Subject: service intervals

 I finally put together a worksheet in Excel so I can document and plan maintenance better. Going through the Bentley and the maintenance manual I can't find any information that states when to repack the wheel bearings.  For the rears it just says 68-72, at 30k miles.

What's the recommended service internal for repacking the front and rear wheel bearings for 73-79?

What's the standard service interval of CV joints?
