Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust stud FART

Hi Tim,

For my most recent exhaust project I made good use of a set of &quot;Snap- 
On&quot; mechanic's gloves that I won as a door-prize at a camp-out last  
year. After six or seven hours of frustration with a wrench in hand,  
I don't have a single scratch, bruise or burn on my hands. I've never  
come out of an exhaust repair unscathed before this.

Highly recommended.  Old fashioned garden-variety leather work gloves  
just can't compare.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
