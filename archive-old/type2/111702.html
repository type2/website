Subject: Weber 34 ICT Carbs

Hello all.

I recently purchased and installed a pair of Weber 34 
ICT Carbs.  My 74 van idles great, and runs fine once 
warm and at speed, however, my acceleration is 
non-existent, which seems to be common with these 
carbs and a stock engine.  In searching past posts I 
have not come up with a definitive answer.  Although a 
couple of suggestions are out there.  Can anyone tell 
me exactly what they did to correct this problem.

The suggestions are to replace the 009 distributor with 
the 050 distributor.  I have also seen the suggestion to 
replace the distributor with a combination centrifugal 
and vacuum advance model.

Also, what jet sizes are recommended to use for the 
1800 motor.

Thank you for your help.  Our van has been sitting for a 
year until we could make the upgrade and I am having 
fun driving it again, I just also want it to be fun to drive.

Jim, Dallas, OR
74 Pink Panther
