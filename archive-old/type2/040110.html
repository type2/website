Subject: Re: Fuel Neck - Possible fix?

On the inboard side of the neck I removed the black card board trim cut a 
hole approximately 3/4 of an inch to locate the clamp. Opened up the hole 
about three inches to get access to the clamp to loosened the clamp had to 
wiggle it some to loosen it. Removed the ring on the outside and removed the 
filler hole from the outside. The boot was torn about 3/4 of an inch at the 
12 o'clock position patched it up with a bicycle tube monkey patch kit. Then 
reinstalled the boot and secured with a clamp around the metal tube to secure 
it to the inboard side using spacers as needed. That part of the metal tube 
just floats between two rubber fuel hose and tears the rubber hose at the 
fuel inlet when the nozzle is forced in to hard. Made this repair 10,000 
miles ago hand still holding, no more gas fumes.
