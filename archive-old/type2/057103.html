Subject: more carb flooding questions....

Greetings all...

I posted several days ago concerning a problem I was having with my 28
Pict1.  When I turn off the car, the carb throat continues to fill with
gas (1-2 minutes), which then leaks out past the accelerator linkage
bushings and onto the fuel pump, etc...

This doesn't happen when the car is running, only when it's stopped.  I
rebuilt the carb 3 weeks ago, and this started afterwards.  I replaced the
needle seat valve, the gasket that separatest the top of the carb from the
bottom, and two jets.  The engine runs and idles very smoothly, it's just
flooding after I stop, and it's dangerous to have gas leaking onto your
engine (duh!:).

The gas is not coming from the upper brass tube (the upward angling tube
that's at the top of the throat), but seems to be coming from somewhere
inside the throat of the carb.   I can hear it flowing into the throat,
but can't see it when I look down into it.

My question is:  What other sources are there for gas to enter the throat
of the carb?  I've asked several people about the accelerator linkage
bushings (having them replaced) and both people have said that if the
bushings are bad, the carb isn't worth saving.  However, both people (and
I) suspected that this isn't the problem.  I think I did something when I
rebuilt the carb, but don't know what it is.   

Unfortunately, I didn't bring my carb diagram here, or I could've
mentioned what I specifically replaced and what I didn't.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Tom
