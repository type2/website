Subject: bus tow bar plans?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Hi,

Does anyone know of anywhere to get plans for a bus towbar.  We have a 73 
westy that is currently not moving under its own power after a fire, and an 87 
suburban that would love to tow it around.  I have access to a complete 
metalworking shop, and someone to tell me what to do with all that stuff.  ANy 
help or plans would be appreciated.

Thanks

Darren
