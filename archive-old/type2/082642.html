Subject: FS - hate to do this...

...but I need to sell my 71 Campmobile project. Here's
the stats:
Not running, bt rolls, brakes are functional. Has 4
NEW LT tires (forget which brand).
Case has been line bore for .010 oversize mains, which
I have. Crank has been cleaned and mains polished,
bearings pressed on.Tranny is fine, have new t/o
bearing.
Heads have been bead blasted, ready for new valves.
Engine tin is complete and repainted.
Floors in cab have been POR15'd and repaired. Body is
straight w/some small dents (quarter-sized. Rust
damage is confined to battery tray and same rear
quarter, outer rockers and roof has surface rust. In
the time I've had the bus,it has been stored in a
garage. Was a Cali bus until 3-4 years ago.
Interior is complete, front seats need padding and
recovering.
I have TONS of spares for the bus - oil pumps, cables,
carbs, dizzies, trim rings, rods, valve springs,
couple of generatorsa, etc. All will go with the bus.
This is an excellent project - I have neither the time
or $$ for it now. It will be offered only to you
listees (unless I get no response...) for $500, a very
fair price (read, no dickering please). The bus is
located in Cornwall, ny (Orange County).
Interested listees should contact me off-list at: dermakot716_at_yahoo_dot_com
