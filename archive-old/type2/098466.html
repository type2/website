&gt; Listmembers need be aware that this is actually not acceptable,
whatsoever in any state at any time, and I don't care who or where you
are because you're sharing this planet with me and my kids.

Muriatic acid is another name for hydrochloric acid, which is another name
for the acid that it in your stomach right now.  While I wouldn't pour
undiluted muriatic on the ground it wouldn't mean the end of life as we
know it.  It would buffer with the minerals in the soil and pretty much be
neutralized with time and rain.  After all, we do pour the stuff into
swimming pools and then jump in ourselves!

To me, the objectionable stuff would be the gas tank leavings  That stuff
is petrolum-based and will probably be around longer.

If your community has &quot;hazardous waste roundups&quot; this is the place to take
this stuff.  Make the haz waste guy's job easier by marking the container
with its contents (&quot;Muriatic acid + petroleum residue&quot;).

If you have to store the stuff for a while before disposal, you can make
it safer by adding baking soda to the acid to neutralize it.

&gt; this has been a public service message.

&gt; &gt;It really doesn't cost much to experiment with a 50/50 acid solution
and the POR-15 Marine Clean but you do need a work place you can dump
these liquids like a backyard.

As a science teacher it scares me when people suggest experimenting with a
mixture of various cleaners or solvents.  I have no idea what is in
&quot;marine clean&quot; but I can think of lots of household chemicals that I
could mix with muriatic acid to produce a home version of Saddam's
chemical weapons.
