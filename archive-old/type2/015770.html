&gt;called in the '80-83 Vanagons have the 4.57, so what year did the 4.57
&gt;show up? I thought the 091 came out in '74, although it was weird for
&gt;that year, and changed again in '75???

The 091 trannies started in 76 in the US.  At this time my best guess is
that sometime in 74 they changed from 5.375 to 4.86, still in the 002 case.
 In 76 they started with the 4.57 and the 091 case.  The 75 case was one
year only, 002 number but with 091 style ribs on it.

&gt;    Obviously Bentley is screwed up in these specs -- gasp! If we can't
&gt;believe Bentley, what can we believe? 

You can't believe anything.  As Todd_at_VolksWerks says, you really can't be
sure what you've got until you open it up and look.  You can just make an
educated guess.
