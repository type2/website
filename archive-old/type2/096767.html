&lt;&lt; I imagine the car next to this bus staring at the driver and passenger 
inside the flooded cab, water over the front windows, gropping for the door

Burst a water bed inside a bus and two things would probably happen...
The engine would probably flood and die causing very rapid deceleration
coupled with a decided list in the direction the water decided to take...
Altogether, as Laurie Anderson once said, &quot;I'd rather see this on TV...&quot;
