Subject: AIRS talk

Ive edited my data to remove my telephone# from my listing. I
know someone could still look up so its a small protest.
Anyone who thinks the intent of AIRS was to create a public help line is
wrong. I KNOW because I was there. I will gladly entertain any listee and
if I see someone post an intention to travel to my area I will send them a
personal invitation along with my phone#.
Others, well they can email me and if I am able to, I will help.
I encourage everyone who signed up for AIRS to consider the
ramafications.

intriguing for a split second and then is not
appealing at all.                  -ellis  6/2k
