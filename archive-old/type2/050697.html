Subject: Re: [T2] Best spark plugs?

In my experience Bosch plugs don't like to work after they've been fouled
and cleaned.  A bad carburetor put my rich running bus through like 5 sets
of Bosch plugs.  I kept asking my FLAPS for some NKG plugs but they insisted
on Bosch.  So they'd get fouled, stop firing, I'd clean them, and they never
seemed to come back.  I dunno..
