Subject: RE: vw theft prevention

Several folks have suggested ignition or fuel cutoff devices that
should be good against the casual thief or joy-rider.

Unfortunately, the pro thief simply drives up with a flatbed hauler,
winches the vehicle onto the ramp, and drives away.  Not much you can
do about this.  It's commonplace here for tow companies to patrol
parking lots looking for illegally-parked vehicles.  If they find one
they hitch it up and tow it away with the alarm blaring.  Nobody gives
them a second thought.  Not much one can do about this short of
locking the bus in a closed garage.
