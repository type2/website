I'm with Shelby. It's totally worth it. Even when my bus was parked at
work, waiting on little rubber elbows, my heart lit up every day when I
got here and saw her. She may not be the purtyest bus around, but I
think she's bee-yoo-tee-full. She makes me smile.

It's a commitment, though. I feel like I'm just getting familiar with
the quirks, and it's been only a year already. It's always something!
The more I know, the less I know.

Praise for the Almighty List! I might've given up by now if I'd had to
do this in a void.

The kookiest cat anyone ever met. She will be missed.
