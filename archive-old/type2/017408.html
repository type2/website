Subject: TGIF - VW stories

A workmate of mine sent the following story to me after realizing I was
a VW enthusiast.  I thought it was worth sharing with the group.  Who
knows, maybe someone on the list remembers these cars...  The author is
probably in her mid to late 30's now...  keep 'on 'busin...  -Alabama

VW memories:

So when I was growing up in CA my mom had a VW Karmann Ghia whose
previous owner had installed a oil filter kit consisting of a roll of
one-ply toilet paper.  I remember her changing the roll occasionally.
This was the days before personalized license plates and the number
portion happened to be &quot;007&quot; - more than one note was left on the car.
Funny, huh?

My first car was a super Beetle convertible - red/black.

Then when I was in college in San Diego a roommate drove a suped-up
(sp?) Ghia whose license plate said &quot;IEATV8S&quot;.  He worked on VW's and
later lost part of a finger to one.  Oooops!

Later.
