There's a few things you can do to make sure it doesn't overflow:

1. Habitually visit and put in, say 23 gallons at a time so its always around
half full
2. Learn the particular foibles of your petrol gauge and know what marks mean
what - I guess they're all a bit different here, but I know that if its on the
last mark, I'm gonna get about 45-50 litres in, So it'd be easy to put, say,
40 litres in and know its nearly but not quite full.

and sit there for 2-3 minutes just short of entering the petrol station, bizarrely
looking in my mirrors trying to figure out which side the flap is on. (I also drive
regularly a VW Polo, a Citroen van and a Vauxhall combi, and they all have filler
flaps on different sides (well, that doesn't make sanse, but there seems to be no
logical pattern in which side it should be on (and you can't always stretch the
hose over to the other side (over a van/camper body (except the Polo (which isn't
a van (more of an estate car))))))).).
