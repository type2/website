Everybody knows how your mind tends to wander off on strange tangents
when you're crusing down a nice, long, quiet stretch of road (sans
deer). :-)

After seeing one of those little teeny outdoor propane radiant camping
heaters at a Wal-Mart, I thought, &quot;Wouldn't it be cool if there was such
a thing that you could use on the inside of your camper that would
attach to the LP stove burner for its fuel source?&quot; Handy when you don't
have shore power or an inverter powerful enough for your electric
mini-ceramic heater.

Now, before you start stressing to me the importance of ventilation and
the necessity of using those little radiant (and otherwise) heaters
OUTSIDE, just let me say in advance -- I KNOW, I KNOW!!! I also know
it's really stupid to use your stove as a source of heat in your bus. I
KNOW, I KNOW!!! And I hope everyone else knows, too.

I did find that making my cup of cocoa just before bed really helped to
make the inside of my camper nice and toasty on those chilly nights.
