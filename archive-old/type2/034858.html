Subject: Sliding door

I was just at the junkyard, and the man had a couple of really nice sliding 
doors(rust free) with all the hardware for $75each. Is that a good price on a 
sliding door? I started some body work on mine, and thought &quot;hell, 75 bucks 
might be worth me not doing this.....&quot;
