I've got to agree with Dave as far as the relay trick
is  concerned.   it might not be a &quot;correct&quot; fix, but
after our cross country trip last summer, push
starting at every stop i installed the simple relay
and have had no problems at all around town or on our
latest trip east.   so i say its a cheap, easy thing
to try and will only take about 15 minutes to install.

&gt; do you think that even a perfectly good
&gt; starter/solenoid
&gt; could swell from heat to the point that the pull- in
&gt; winding
&gt; cannot overcome the resistance of metal-to-metal
&gt; contact ?
&gt; 
&gt; there are at least two sides to the theory of
&gt; lubricating the
&gt; solenoid plunger, and up here in the frozen dead of
&gt; winter
&gt; we experience a similar condition of no-start, which
&gt; i
&gt; believe is the reduced battery capacity ( cold
&gt; cranking amps
&gt; at 0 degrees farenheit ) gedzundheit ! excuse me...
&gt; 
&gt; i am a believer in the starter relay fix which uses
&gt; the existing
&gt; circuitry for signal only, and provides a larger
&gt; diameter wire for
&gt; the power path . i have even resorted to a jumper
&gt; wire from the
&gt; isolated secondary battery to provide additional
&gt; amperage .
&gt; 
&gt; the next time your starter fails, try the
&gt; screwdriver method of
&gt; solenoid activation and ponder the elimination of 
&gt; current draw
&gt; through those tiny contacts in the ignition switch
&gt; electrical portion
&gt; ( have you ever seen the internals ? ) .
