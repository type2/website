Subject: Re: [T2] 1968 Bus

&gt;Just a trivial question here( maybe a couple)
&gt;Were there one year only parts in the 68?

- padded dash board raised above the instrument cluster;
- rear view mirror;
- door handles (64-68);
- windshield wiper arms;
- i have a set of seemingly 68 only front bumper overriders,
  have seen matching overriders, larger, on a local 68 westy;
- master cylinder fill res., and metal line to m/c;
- idiot lights have no symbols.

Q: do 69 up double cabs have grey weave seatbelts with the crest decal
     on a metal clasp, or is that 68 only?
