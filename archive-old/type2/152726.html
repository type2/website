Subject: Re: [T2] 71 tail light bulb holder?

Unlike most American makes (and some Japanese ones as well), VW or SWF (the
OE maker) never offered this separately from the reflector.  You may have to
find a good one from a used reflector assembly.

IMHO, the time, energy and $$ spent looking for that elusive item would be
better spent buying a new reflector assembly.

&gt; Has anyone replaced the actual bulb holder, not the complete
&gt; reflector? One of the bayonets seems loose, and I thought I'd take it
&gt; out and fix. I'd like to pop in a new bulb holder, but I cant seem to
&gt; find a replacement other than the complete thing ;-((  (although
&gt; Busdepot has a good price for that)
&gt; It seems to be held by 4 tabs, and I wondered if they are likely to break.
