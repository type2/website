&gt; Watch the #3 valves.
&gt; You will see the exhaust open and then close.
&gt; JUST as the exhaust closes , the intake will start to open.
&gt; STOP. When you rock the crank back and forth, the rocker arms will
&gt; rock back and forth. At the instant they
&gt; are equal, stop and look at your crank pulley. At about an inch to
&gt; the left of the top screw hole, you should
&gt; feel a tiny cut in the inboard edge of the pully. That is the TDC
&gt; mark. Paint it white! Now is also time to
&gt; look at where your dist rotor is pointing. It should be at the index
&gt; mark for #1 to fire, because your #1
&gt; piston is.
You say &quot;just as the exhaust closes, the intake will start to open&quot;. 
On my bus, when I do this, there's a few degrees of both of them
closed.  Not many, maybe 5* at most (less than an inch on the fan
pulley).  Does this mean my camshaft is rounding or am I 180* off base?
 I've heard others say the same thing as you just described, and I
hadn't really thought much about it.... until now.
