Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Waving drivers


Odd.  In Sacramento, EVERY Type 2 driver waves at you.  Same attitude 
difference you see in the Lakers and Kings, I guess... ;^)

You know.  This one kills me.  I remember when I used to have a
motorcycle you could not pass another person on a motorcycle with you or
the other person waving at each other as if to say &quot;Cool, you ride a
bike too,&quot; or &quot;Nice bike.&quot;  Why don't Vdub owners do the same thing.

My apologies in advance to those of you that do.

Here in West Los Angeles, I can't believe all the buses I see everyday -

and I'm pretty sure in the last ten years only one person has ever waved

back at me.
Also, in the two or so years I've been wandering around town putting
&gt;those type 2 flyers on people's buses windshields wherever they may be
(along with a nice handwritten note from me saying something like, &quot;Hey,

nice bus.  I live down the way.  Check out type2_dot_com.  Call me and we
can have a great time talking about and fixing up our buses&quot;) - anyway,
in all the time I've been giving bus people flyers, NO ONE has ever come

by the house or called.  Not one.  The other day I waited with my
daughter outside the market next to a really nice 68-71 sunroof bus -
the sunroof was caulked shut and I wanted to tell the owner about how
I'd seen some talk on the list about how easy it is to fix a leaky
sunroof.  When the guy comes out, he looks like I'm asking for money and

drives away fast.  Whatever, my friend, just trying to help...

I'd kill to have a bus owner down the road who'd like to poke around
each others' buses!  It's really depressing, and just about the exact
opposite of this helpful, friendly list.  Go figure.
