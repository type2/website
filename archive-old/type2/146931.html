Subject: Best way to pay for a bus if you can't collect in person ?

Dear folks,

I'm hoping to go through with a US-UK bus transaction and wondered if 
anyone has any good advice as to the best way to arrange payment so that 
the seller is happy and so am I.  I've looked at Escrow and that seems 
to be the best way, but to be honest if the seller hasn't heard of 
Escrow then its reputation is kind of zero by default (I know it's not 
really).  Any other suggestions ?

The only reasons I'm not going to collect myself is 1) cost of flight 
and of course 2) minimizing the number of times I leave the ground in my 
life : )

Lee
