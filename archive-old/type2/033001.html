Subject: Time For a new Transmission.

I've been occasionally popping out of 4th for the past couple years.  This
past summer it has gotten worse - much more than occasional -- the bunge
cord technique is getting old.

It apparently has had this problem for some time.  Looking at its repair
records, 8 years and 25,000 miles ago, the PO had the pinion bearing and
gear sets replaced because it would pop out of fourth at highway speeds.

Since then I replaced the 1700 engine with a 2000cc from a '78.  In the past
there has been some discussions that the '72 transmission is not the best
match up for the '78 engine.  I know there are some differences in gear
ratios, but other than that I am not sure what else is different.

1) I am correct in looking for transmission to go with the engine and not
the body?

2) Who has been satisfied with their rebuild tranny?  If so where did you
get it?  I do not want to have to do this job more than once.

Thanks
