&gt;I purchased a rear cross member for my 75 bus.  I need the cross member
&gt;that goes under the engine and the engine mounts bolt into it.  The
&gt;cross member I received from motorworks doesn't look right but may be
&gt;correct since I don't know what the mount should look like.  Could
&gt;someone take a picture of theirs either in or out of their bus??  It
&gt;would help me a great deal.

Two rubber mounts are required: 211 199 231C

&gt;The part number for the cross member I
&gt;received is 211 703 475G.  Does anyone know the part number (or can look
&gt;it up) for the engine cross member is this the correct part number???
&gt;Any help would be wonderful.

That part number isn't in the body or engine categories...

021 199 203E is th correct part number for the engine carrier.
