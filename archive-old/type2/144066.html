yeah yeah and where were you yesterday LOL.....
 
wireing a trailer no isnt that hard now that i have done it.. and yes since i got past that 4 wire 5 wire thing with the help of the adapter that greg told me to get.. and paul gave me the confidence and renote to do...
 
 
for the record and for those that did not see my post....
i did get this done and did say thanks for greg and pauls help so i dont really think there is no need for anything further...........unless of course you just feel there is more that must be said....?
 
the thought of you helping me though  Thanks
 
thanks
chris

Wiring-in a trailer to a bus is not difficult. I see
Paul Manning has said most of what I have to say, so I
won't say it again.

The annoying piece is the 4-light to 3-light converter
unit you need to buy from U-Haul.

Would you like me to send you pictures of my
installation? It worked first-time, and continues to
work a couple o'years later.
