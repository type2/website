Subject: '73 interior in Ecology, Wilmington, CA
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10012251604220.24834-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Nikki and I were out scouting the yards yesterday and came across a '73
Westy with a near complete interior in the Wilmington Ecology yard.  The
interior on this year is the same mustard color as the '68-'72 but cloth,
not naugahyde.  The jumpseat pad was pretty dirty, but otherwise good. It
also has the one-year '73 poptop cot.

At the same time, this whole bus was *very* nice (by my admittedly
east-coast lowered expectations :-)  The nose was straight, and I saw no
other damage.  It is savable fersure!  Needs engine and trans, of course.

Today's guru was yesterday's
&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
