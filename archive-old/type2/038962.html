Subject: Re: suggestions as to the essential things we would need + a little note on the hubcap

Not much bus content in this, but I vote for food that doesn't have to be
cooked.  I always travel with a big bag of  peanuts and raisens, with some
peanut M&amp;Ms mixed in if I'm feeling flush.

Next time something about a bus.

Or, here you go:  Steve Dolan got the hubcap all the way up to Detroit, and
I couldn't get to it.  Sheesh.  So, it's on it's way back to VA.  Anybody
want to line up to push it further north?  I suspect he'll add a note on his
trip pretty soon.  Think positive things about engine swapping in the
meantime.
