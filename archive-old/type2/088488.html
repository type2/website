Subject: Re: [T2] window rubber

so do you guys use sealant for the other windows, besides the windshield?

yes, if i was going to replace a windshield i probably would use some type
of sealant, but i thought in this instance we were talking about a rear
window rubber replacement...

should i have used sealant on the rear glass? was there any type of sealant
there to begin with?

TIA!
