Subject: 74 Exhaust on a 79 Westy
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hi
  Just wanted to send a post thanking all who replied to my exhaust question. 
this coming week I plan to call BD to order a complete 74 system for my 
hibernating (bbrrr) 79 Westy.  
   Thanks again to all who replied. Another reason why VW owners are the 
best.
