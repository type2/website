&gt; Lesson 1:  Don't assume a part is bad and replace it.

But shotgunning is FUN!

&gt;
&gt; Lesson 2:  Don't work on the bus with it in the garage anymore.  My home
&gt; and its contents are far too valuable.
&gt;

Just wait until you need to fix something while it's snowing... =)

&gt; Lesson 3:  Always remove the battery ground even if I'm not planning on
&gt; touching the electrical stuff.
&gt;

Indeed. I learned that lesson too when I fried my Pertronix by letting
a hot wire short.
&gt; It caught fire and I had to get the
&gt; extinguisher out.  One quick well directed burst and everything was
&gt; under control.

Ask Troy about my welding mishap... !

&gt;
&gt; Question 1:  Should there be a lock washer where the larger alternator
&gt; bracket attaches to the fan shroud?

I haven't seen one, but a wavy washer wouldn't be a bad idea.

&gt; Question 2:  Is it possible the alternator survived?  I suppose I could
&gt; have it tested at the FLAPS, or test the output when I get things put
&gt; back together.

Possibly. Flaps can't test these. All you can do is try. I've got a
core you can have if you need one though...

&gt;
&gt; Question 3:  Is the wiring harness from the alternator to the VR
&gt; available new?
&gt;

Not that I've seen, but the original ones are pretty tough. You know
who to go see...

&gt; Question 4:  Did i fry the VR?
&gt;

Possibly. I have one you can swap in to test if you need it.

The reason you had a fire was the wire from the alt to the starter is
ALWAYS hot. It's directly connected to the battery +. In fact, my alt
bypasses that starter bolt and goes straight to the battery currently
(will be corrected when I pull the engine next).

Let me know if I can help. I went through some alternator gymnastics
with the GWB and still have stuff left over...
