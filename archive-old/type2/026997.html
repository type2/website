I don't know I took the whole exhaust system/heat exchangers as one unit and 
set it up against the wall in my garage.  now there is a pool of oil in my 
garage.  I will investigate where it came from tonight when i go home.  
wait, how do i find out were it really is.  I think it is in both the pipes 
and the box.

adam
&gt;is the oil in the pipes or in the box? f in the box you likely have a
&gt;leaky fn seal.
