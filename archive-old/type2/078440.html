X-ECS-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: Fort Collins CO living

Hi.  This is a random try, but I have recently been living out of my '79 westy
on my freinds' rented property, and their landlord explained to me that he
could not allow it; therefore, I have nowhere to reside in my mobile home.  I
was curious if anyone on this kind list could help me out with suggestions or
had a square of land (or garage) they would consider renting.  I am currently
doing work for a masters thesis at CSU, so I have to stay around Fort Collins,
but would be happy to pay rent and am completely self-sufficient with my setup
(no electricity or water needed).
Your help is sincerely appreciated, and thanks for reading this.

ps.  If you could please reply to my email (simon6_at_engr.colostate_dot_edu) then we
can get in touch by  phone/person.
