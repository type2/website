Like with anything, your risk goes up with exposure.  People who dealt
with powdered asbestos in their jobs were the only ones who showed
statistically higher disease rates.  Their spouses also showed higher
rates, due to asbestos powder carried home on clothing.

The people most affected were brake mechanics, because they were exposed
to finely powdered airborne asbestos almost continuously.  Another &quot;hot&quot;
group was
workers who made the Kent Micronite cigarette filters.  These filters were
manufactured of compacted powdered asbestos.  The fact that the workers
also received all the Kent cigarettes they wanted might have increased
their mortality as well  :(

For us normal folk, exposure to asbestos is minimal, even from the few
parts of our buses that contain asbestos.  It might increase
the chances of developing cancer, but so does drinking a beer.  I think
that worrying about incidental exposure to asbestos is probably more
harmful than the exposure itself!
