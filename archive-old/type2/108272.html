Subject: Brake cylinder pistons

Listees,
    I have a neighbor that recently purchased a 70 Westy from The Bugg Shop
in Holly Ridge, NC. He also paid $300 to have the front brakes done
including replacing the wheel cylinders. After he got home, he pulled the
drum and saw that the cylinders were still rusty and greasy. He contacted
the owner, Gary, and was told that the wheel cylinders are no longer
available, but that he replaced the pistons. Gary does not seemed inclined
to refund all or any portion of the money.
    This sounds like BS to me, but I wanted to know if anyone has heard of
just replacing the pistons in the wheel cylinders. Also, if he was taken,
what kind of recourse does he have? Any lawyers out there willing to help
him if necessary?
Later,
Jim
