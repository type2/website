Subject: Answering a 'VW' ad

Well, I was reading through a Trader today and came upon an intriguing ad:

1971 VW $1000

Since my daughter is currently searching for a car, she called the number
listed. Here's how it went.

She: Hello, I'm calling about the VW for sale.

He: OK

She:Can you tell me what model it is? A beetle, type 2,     type 3?

He: I don't know nothing about types. It's a round orange thing.

She: Ooo-K. What can you tell me about it?

He: Well, it ran good when it was parked. The floors are kinda bad.

She: When was it parked?

He: 1990

She: Thanks for your time.

For a guy who doesn't know anything about VW's, he sure wants a lot of money
for  one!

Just thought I'd share.

Regards,
Dave
