Subject: Westy fridges?

     After living in my westy for a month now, I'm getting a bit tired
of having to buy ice all the time. Will the electric/propane fridges
from the later westies fit a '73 easily? Other than the obvious
electrical &amp; gas connections? Do they work on 110v as well? Anyone got
one for sale?
