Subject: Re: [T2] Vehicle Weight and Tires

Andy

When I calculated this first,,, I took into consideration Vw originally
installed tires with max weight at 40 psi ... and they recommended 40  psi on
the rear,, and 30 on the front for fully laden vehicle

That is 100 percent inflation on the rear,, and 75 percent inflation on the
front...

then I used the same method to calc as you did.. but I threw in that 75 percent
factor for the front

Also.. i rounded the 47.8 psi up to 48 psi for the rear...
the front came in at 40 psi with the 75 percent factor

Looks like we agree on the rear at about 47 - 48 psi... but I still wonder about
that 75percent ratio front to rear,,,,

You asked 2 questions.. Why do you have so much weight in the front? Or are the
numbers reversed?
and you were interested in the year,, as I said in the original message ,, my
camper is a 74 deluxe

The numbers are NOT reversed... I looked at them the same way...they do looked
reversed..
 I should have included my conclusion on that in the original email..
When I first weighed the van,, it was 2182 lbs on the front,, and 2380 for the
rear... 200 lbs heavier in the rear
this is loaded with my camping gear, gas and the driver...
then I weighed it as I headed down the road... with one more passenger in the
front,, and 2 in the rear.
the front passenger weighs in at 200 lbs,, and the 2 in the back add up to 200
lbs total...[2 kids that weigh 100 lbs each...]
These numbers are guesses,, as I didn't weigh all the people,, they were in the
camper when it was on the scale.. and the front got heavier than the rear...

Yes,, it appears as GVW is about 5268 lbs....

I had the chance to weigh my camper recently, so here is some info...
My 74 Westfalia Camper ....
Loaded, with the driver , and 1 passenger in the front,  about 400 lbs right
there !
2 passengers  in the rear... only about 200 lbs for both of them!

Scale Weight on Front:  2788 lbs......1399 lbs on each tire
Scale Weight on Back :  2480 lbs......1240 lbs on each tire
Total weight  5268 lbs

Tires:
Yokohama LT195/75R14  Load range &quot;D&quot;   M&amp;S
1710 lbs max _at_ 65 psi


So,, if I did the math right,, I should put 48 psi in the rear tires.. and 40 in
the front tires when I have this much load in the camper....

&gt; Without published data from the tire manufacture, you can get close with
&gt; this:
&gt;
&gt; actual (or max. expected) gross tire weight (or half the axle weight) /
&gt; max. tire weight rating * tire max. inflation
&gt;
&gt; In this case:
&gt;
&gt; front   1399 / 1710 * 65 = 53
&gt; rear   1240 / 1710 * 65 = 47
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Two questions:
&gt;
&gt; What year is your van, Jamie? A quick glance at my '79 owner's manual
&gt; shows a GVWR between 4960 (station wagon) and 5070 (kombi and delivery
&gt; van). Looks like you may be outside that.
&gt;
&gt; Why do you have so much weight in the front? Or are the numbers reversed?
