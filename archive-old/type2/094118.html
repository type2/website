Thanks.  Too bad I un-rented the puller last night.  The drag link looked ok
so I didn't bother to replace it along with the tie-rods.  The skirt
underneath kept it in better condition.

&gt;&gt; Second question:  They measured the camber in the rear and it was -2
&gt;&gt; degrees instead of about -50.  They asked me about tire wear but I
&gt;&gt; didn't notice any with my last set of tires.
&gt; 
&gt; eh? -2 degrees vs -50 degrees or -.50 degrees?  Slightly excessive
&gt; negative camber seems to be the norm, on the rear, for IRS buses.  I dont
&gt; have the bentley in front of me to pull the actual spec, but 2 degrees
&gt; sounds a like a bit to much.  You may want to look at your rear trailing
&gt; arms to see if they've been bent, OR if your rear wheel bearings have
&gt; enough slop in them to cause this.

I wrote them down because they said it was too late for a printout (another
minus from the visit).  One was -2.2 (-2 degrees 12 min) and the other -1.8
(-1 degrees 48 min).

How bad is this?
  
&gt;&gt; Anyway, we went through the Bentley and the procedure was to reset the
&gt;&gt; rear torsion bars which they do at their shop.  What should I do?

They weren't VW experts by any means.  We looked in the Bentley because the
manager was curious.  They had no intention of working on the torsion bars.
 
&gt; Of course, excessive rearend sag can cause this, too.  Is it saggy?

It used to look a little saggy when I had 185's on the front and 195's on
the rear.  I measured approximately at the jack points (good enough?):

Right front: 15&quot;
Right rear: 15&quot;
Left front: 14.5&quot;
Left rear: 14.25&quot;

All the cabinet and spare tire are on the left side.  Is the sagging a
little in the rear left only?
