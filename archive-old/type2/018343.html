&gt; &gt;  I hate to say this but you are SO wrong!  Take the following scenario as
&gt; &gt;  justification for my opinion - you are driving down the road and
&gt; &gt;  unbeknownst to you a plastic bag gets sucked into your side scoop and
&gt; &gt;into
&gt; &gt;  your engine fan.  The driver with gauges notices that his CHT and oil
&gt; &gt;temp
&gt; &gt;  are suddenly going up very fast, pulls over and removes the bag.  The
&gt; &gt;  driver with no gauges motors happily along until his engine overheats and
&gt; &gt;  locks up.
&gt; 
&gt; Another Scenerio:
&gt; 
&gt; You're driving on a gravel road.  Because you can't hear the engine, you
&gt; forget to shift from 3rd to 4th, so you're driving along at 50 mph in 3rd
&gt; gear, until your engine overheats.  If you had a temperature gage, you would
&gt; have noticed the temperature and figured out the problem.

Excuse me, but I think you'll NEVER overheat your motor by using too low
a gear. This is exactly what you do when it is overheating due to high
outsid temps or steep grades- drop down a gear.( And of course, slow
down a little)
