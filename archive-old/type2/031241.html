&gt; 1974 California certified with automatic trans was an 1800 fuel injected

which will (had) a flex plate and Torque convertor rather than a flywheel
and clutchh

&gt; engine.  The shop manuals, and a current post list the engine # prefix to
&gt; displacement if it is not converted to a 2.0 in the 1800 case.  In any event,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  The person selling it says it's a 1800 but it's fuel injected so
&gt; &gt; it's most likely a 2 liter isn't it?  It's complete with all accessories and
&gt; &gt; the fuel injection components, harness, computer, etc.

VW made Fuel Injected 1.7, 1.8 &amp; 2 liter engines.  make sure this is a Bus
engine and not a 411/412 engine there are slight differences and they can
work but be aware that there are some changes that need to be made.

also there were air cooled fuel injected 914 engines that are very similar
to the bus engine and many (most) parts are the same
