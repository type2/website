&gt;After all this talk about valve seats I have come to the
&gt;conclusion that if your head is cool you probably won't drop a seat &gt;&gt;


I agree and jump into the fray, what is a good way to do this on a T4?  I
know there are filter adapter plates, in fact for a real trick unit that
would fit fine the FWD VW world sells one with a built in thermostat so you
don't either overcool or have to use a separate one, about $150.  I also
note if you do use an external thermostat like you should otherwise JEGS for
us rednecks sells the same thermostat Bergman, Larry's Offroad, etc do for
about $20 less for good ole merican iron.  But my question is a bit off
topic, does a T1 adapter flange bolt onto the stock T4 cooler location?
Looks like it will to me, and probably with 90 degree fittings you could
shoot the hoses off where the cooler used to be.  I sort of like this cause
first it allows you to not have the left side cooling air being split
between  cooler and cylinders (I've always wondered if CFM wise this is
accounted for by the flap on that side) assuming I guess you fashion a
little block off plate on the tin where the cooler resided, and second it
wouldn't lower my oil filter an inch or so that an adapter plate does and is
likely a lot cheaper.  So anyone know if it works, if it is a good idea.
Just starting to guess I figure using a nice 72 plate MESA style low
restriction cooler with a thermostatic fan over on the left side with holes
through the tray there so it gets both the ram air from the engine
compartment blown through and then the fan as needed would be sort of slick.
And I sort of guess the new cooler would basically be thermostatically
controlled by the regular bypass spring the same way the stocker is as it
strived to maintain proper oil pressure regardless of a change in the
restricion or flow using the external plate cooler.  Any ideas, opinions,
anyone do this?  The flange mountings look nearly the same to me.

Also for anyone doubting the wisdom of Joe's statement consider this,
Porsche took this obviously to ultimate extremes.  Although air might cool
the cylinders of a big 911 you better believe it is that massive dry sump
and couple of gallons of circulating oil that is carrying away the real
heat.
