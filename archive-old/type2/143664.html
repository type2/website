Subject: Re: [T2] AIRS rescue---Engine runs fine, but dies when the
  engine is under load.

With regards to fires on the Cold Start then immediately dies, I ran
into this problem when The s15 connection from the ignition to the coil
was not connected.

If y'all don't have a Bentley about, I can scan the troubleshooting
pages for the FI tomorrow morning. Perhaps someone else is equipped to
do so today. Either way, I'd be happy to host them off my web server for
you.
