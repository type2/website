Subject: Re: [T2] Burned wires

As I chase this issue down I consulted the haynes manual that the PO
provided with the bus when I bought it.

On the wiring diagram there is a hand drawn line that I believe represents
the wire that burnt out on me.

heres my artistic rendition of whats in the manual

http://www.zachula_dot_com/newgallery/bustek/bus_73_75modified?full=1

It looks like this line connects to the alternator and the battery for
some reason and the wire that burnt out may not even be a stock
configuration.  I am going to go and get some more pictures and pull the
alternator and see if I can't get the wiring harness out later today.

I'll have more pics tonight at the very least.

&gt; zach the big wire that is melted looks to me to be the wire that runs
&gt; between the alternator and the starter...? might not be but just what it
&gt; looks like to me...?
&gt;
&gt;   the little blue wire is either the oil light for your dash or the
&gt; battery light.. might be something else... but i was thinking there is
&gt; a blue and a black wire for battery and oil light? i dont know now
&gt; since i had to replace my whole harness with other wireing
&gt; ....(homemade wireing harness).... but i do know that the bentley has
&gt; a accurate diagram in there of these wires.. cause i had to go by it
&gt; when i did my harness... (do you have a bentley)? if not get one
&gt; borrow one must need for things like this...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   maybe with the pictures zach one of the list gurus knows best whats up
&gt; and can give you better help than i ever could ...
&gt;
&gt;   good luck with that..
&gt;   wELL lets go finish the beetle engine and get it ready to install....
&gt; have a grateful day
&gt;   peace
