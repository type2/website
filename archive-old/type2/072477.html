Alex ¯

My '78 used to do that [rattle on startup somwetimes, but not always,
then settle down], plus every once in awhile clatter like hell, then
stop. Hydraulic lifters do drain [as per Alistair's suggestion], and
sometimes they stick as well. You can 1] pull them out and clean/replace
them; 2] let them ride till they really make racket; or 3] replace them
w/solid lifters. Options 1 and 3 are easy w/T4 engines ¯ just pull the
rockers, then extract the little buggers w/a magnet*

I replaced mine w/solids because 1] I like to adjust valves
likeeverybody else does; and 2] mechanically, they're more efficient.

Hugh
