Subject: disc brake front end in 1970 campmobile

I've got a 1970 campmobile that I'd like to have front disc brakes in.  I
know that disc brakes began in '71, but how new can the front end be to work
with my '70?

Also, what other parts are required, or will have to be replaced--and what's
all this about a vacuum booster??  I'll be running dual Kadrons which St.
Berg says can run a vacuum booster with a &quot;T&quot; in the balance pipe.

whatdayathink?
