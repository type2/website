Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel cut off

Just shows what can happen whenever you try to &quot;improve&quot; a stock system. 
You don't know the results of an experiment until you run it and see what 
happens.

Try this. Before shutting off the motor, hit the fuel cutoff and let it 
idle for a minute or so. That should leave the float valve open to relieve 
any residual pressure buildup.

&gt;Just offering some advice.
&gt;I have installed a solenoid cut off in the fuel line

&gt;when I turn it
&gt;off the pressure has risen to as high as 12psi.

&gt;  What this now does is make it MUCH more likely to push a
&gt;hose off, or burst an old line. So just beware. I'm now wondering how to
&gt;relive this pressure!!
