Subject: Re: [T2] decibel

Very interesting!  I always knew my bus was loud but never really 
thought about it much.  Driving cross-country, I remember my ears would 
be ringing after long stretches of continuous driving (6-8 hours at a 
time).  Those numbers explain a lot.

Another thing to consider - what carb you run makes a big difference in 
noise production.  The stock carbs were relatively quiet, even with the 
air filters removed.  The Dell DRLA's were much, much louder.  That was 
one of the reasons I ended up removing them.  I think FI is quieter than 
most (if not all) carbs.

The mattress and/or sound deadening over the engine compartment helps, 
but I think the worst offender is the sound-chamber of a fuel tank 
compartment that our busses have.  While my fuel tank was out, I put 
some dynamat-like stuff on the forward wall, and also on the ceiling and 
inside of the cover plate.  This is the only picture of it I could find:

I am going to put another layer on the outside surfaces as well.
