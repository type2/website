Subject: Re: [T2] jumpseat out of pre-72 style westy

Ok Billy, I think that it is safe to say that as is the case with most of 
the VW mindset That if you are  strapped in then chances are that your seat 
is likely to be as safe you could possibly hope to be.

I personally have  been sitting in a pair of Conversion Van seats from some 
road whale for the past 18yrs.. never did get around to attaching them to 
&quot;Janis&quot;, when I'm buckled up, I figure the possibility of my seat getting 
out from under me to be minimal.
