Subject: Charging Problems on `72 Westy

I have a '72 Westy with a '74 engine that I rebuilt down to last nut and 
bolt.  I'm having issues now with charging, after letting the bus sit 
for almost two years :{

If I follow the directions on type2_dot_com for checking the voltage 
regulator, i.e, removing the connector, jumping the green wire to the 
battery, and checking voltage, voltage on voltmeter jumps from 12 (where 
it sits normally), to 13. 

My questions:

1. This mean for sure that my v. reg bad, and alternator good?

2. Do I go right out and purchase one of those newer voltage regulators 
that look like small, silver cigarette boxes, from my local parts store?

**  Anyone know where I can get the two hole silver gaskets that go 
between aftermarket exhaust and heater boxes, for 1.8 liter engine, on 
the Web?

Thanks,
James
