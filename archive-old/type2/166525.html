Subject: Re: TDC and vac questions

I'm not sure what carbs you are using. This is what I did with my 
weber 34 icts.

 &gt;Two vac nipples, one on each carb do I use both or just one to go 
to the dizzy?

Use one and block the other.


  &gt; Two big nipple on the carb too, how do I hook up my brake booster?

On the carb or the manifolds? If we are talking dual single throat 
carbs you need to join the intake manifolds together to get the 
engine to idle smoothly (called a balance tube). Put a tee into this 
line to run the brake booster.

  &gt;what about the line from the breather box, where does it go?

My carbs are secondhand and came with the breather box line already 
installed into one of the air filters.

HTH

Martin.
