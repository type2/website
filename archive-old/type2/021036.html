Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Battery Charge System Question
References: &lt;5.1.0.14.2.20010501030618.009f9a80_at_pop.pdq_dot_net&gt; &lt;003d01c0d268$bf933020$b62bdb40_at_smith&gt;

I bought an icp 30 watt solar rig for about $230 delivered from radio
shack online...  

I'm mounting the pv panels (2, 15 watt ea) in a frame that will close
like a box for transport and storage.  Open up the box and voila -
charging wherever you are, as long as there's sun.

I've connectorized everything - charge controller, spade pigtails, etc,
so I can plug in whatever sort of adapter I need.  Battery clamps, cig
lighter input, etc.  I can charge the bus batteries thru the 12 volt cig
adapter that was installed by the PO, or just hook it up to either
battery, and charge my battery pak, too.

Kinda pricy - but in the long run I figure it'll pay for itself in the
boonies.  I use minimal 12 volt appliances, so 30 watt should be enough
to keep both batteries and the pak pretty much fully charged at all
times, for extended unpluggedness.
