I found myself writing a long lesson on heat transfer and thermodynamics 
which
I may at some point post to the archives or post a url to, but is 
probably too long
to post to type2 (and which I don't have time to finish).

Suffice it to say, it can be summarized as:

a) the best way to transfer heat is by conduction, followed by 
convection, then radiation

b) radiative heat is generally negligible as compared to conduction

c) metal-to-metal conduction works better than metal-to-liquid or 
metal-to-gas (or gas-to-gas, etc.)

d) the maximum temperature your exhaust system will reach is the 
temperature in contact with it.
	this would either be your heads, heat exchangers, or temperature of 
the exhaust gases

e) regardless of how well insulated your exhaust system is, heat will 
still be driven into it as long
	as it is cooler than one of the above three temperatures

f) the only way your exhaust system is cooled is by way of ambient air 
(and or air that has been heated
	by the cooling fan exhaust and/or engine)

g) if your exhaust system is hotter than your heads and heat exchangers, 
it will be &quot;cooled&quot;
	by transferring heat to the heads and heat exchangers:  this is 
what you don't want!

Given (a), (b), and (c), I would say that the heat radiated to the 
engine is negligible as compared
to the heat generated by the engine and the heat removed by the cooling 
fan/cool air over the tin.

As to whether you are sending more heat out of the tailpipe or not by 
having a worse
heat transfer coefficient from the exhaust gas to the exhaust system, 
let's just say for a moment
that the heads, heat exchangers and exhaust system are all the same 
temperature, so that
there's no heat transfer going on between them.  This means the amount 
of heat put into
the system at steady state (you've been driving down a flat highway at 
the same speed and
the same outside temperature for a while, so everything has settled out 
and you're engine
temp isn't changing), is:

(exhaust gas flow rate)*(Texhaust-gas - Texhaust-system)*(inside exhaust 
surface area)*Kmg -
(air over exhaust system flow rate) * (Texhaust-system - 
Tambient)*(outside exhaust surface area)*Kmg = 0

(it equals ZERO because you are at steady state -- your exhaust system 
temperature isn't changing)

if we say that the surface areas are the same, we get:

(exhaust gas flow rate)*(Texhaust-gas - Texhaust-system)*Kmg = (air over 
exhaust system flow rate) * (Texhaust-system - Tambient)*Kmg

and Kmg, the heat transfer coefficient, also falls out, giving us:

(exhaust gas flow rate)*(Texhaust-gas - Texhaust-system) = (air over 
exhaust system flow rate) * (Texhaust-system - Tambient)

This means that once everything settles out, the exhaust system 
temperature is only dependant on the
gas flow rates and exhaust gas temperature and ambient temperature.  
This means that the rate you are
&quot;throwing heat out the tailpipe&quot; is dependant on how well you're much 
cooling air you're throwing
over the exhaust system (how fast you're going) and how hot your exhaust 
system is (i.e. how close
it is to the temperature of the exhaust gas) as the exhaust gas flow 
rate and ambient temperatures
are constant.  It doesn't matter what your heat transfer coefficient is 
at all!

So, what's my point?

Well, above we assumed that the heads, heater boxes and exhaust system 
were all the same temperature, but, in
reality, they're probably not.  Since the only way we're getting heat 
OUT of the system is either
through our cooling air or transfer of heat into the heads/heater boxes, 
which we know we DO NOT want to do.
So, we want to maximize our &quot;air&quot; cooling rate so that our steady state 
exhaust system temperature
is lower.  The lower this temperature is, the less heat we will conduct 
to the heads, or, we might even
start to draw heat away from the heads (which would be good).  The only 
way to maximize this
cooling rate is to:  force more cool air over the exhaust system (drive 
faster) or maximize Kmg.  We know
that maximizing Kmg will raise the rate at which heat is put into the 
exhaust system, but, we also know that
as the cooling air flow rate is high compared to the exhaust gas flow 
rate, etc., we're still lowering the
overall heat taken from the system.

So the question becomes:  is the steady state temperature of the exhaust 
system as compared to the
exhaust gas (Texhaust-gas - Texhaust-system) small enough, in general, 
and the ambient temperature
as compared to the exhaust system temp (Texhaust-system - Tambient), 
large enough that increasing
the cooling air flow rate (driving faster or at any speed) makes a 
quantitative difference in the
cooling of the exhaust system.  If (Texhaust-gas - Texhaust-system) - 
(Texhaust-system - Tambient)
is negative, then you want to maximize Kmg because you're primarily 
cooling the system, so long as
your air flow rate is high compared to your exhaust gas flow rate, or at 
least isn't too much smaller
than it, otherwise, you want to minimize it.  In any case, you do NOT 
want to merely coat the outside
of your exhaust system, as then you'll have good heat transfer on the 
inside (exhaust gas to exhaust
system) and your exhaust system will heat up but will be less able to 
transfer heat away from itself.

Hmmm...I need some heat sensors on my bus.

Anyone feel like pointing out the flaws in my logic (if you've read this 
far)?
