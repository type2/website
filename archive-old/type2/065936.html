Subject: Biggest Old Bus Gathering Ever?

Make  a date...July 4 - 6....Malvern in Worcestershire England!
SSVC have got BVF (British Volkswagen festival) to host the meeting of the
Splitty Nation inside the Veedub Universal Gathering...
Some of the rarest and oldest vans ever seen in UK on show...cherry picker,
ladder truck, tipper truck, hearse and more from Bulli Kartei's Mobile museum
together with fire and ambulance trucks, a beer truck and some amazing Barndoor
buses! 
It is a really International event in Bus terms we have people coming from all
over...some with their buses...Italy, Germany, france, holland, portugal,
Sweden and hopefully finland and Australia...maybe even from the long lost
colony across the pond? 
Excellent camping and accommadation...incredible show...beautiful stunning
location..
Interested?
I especially want to contact people who fancy coming and joining in this
special event...
How about driving or shipping your Split?
PS this event is open to any and all VW lover...but SSVC will have a special
area for overseas guests who come with their vans..and will also bring together
Splitty owners who had to leave their vans back at home...
More news as things develop and take shape...
alternatively..contact me direct to get more info etc (or get a special invite
for ypu and your van - free entry to displayers!)
