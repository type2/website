Hello all,
I emailed Rustoleum to see what their paint was like and how it would
last on my bus since I'm painting my '63 kombi with it.  There has been
some discussion on this lately and I hope this helps.

thanks!

Rustoleum rep:

Thank you for contacting Rust-Oleum.
It should last awhile.  I can't say for sure, but I can tell you that a
lot
of people paint their cars with our product and they turn out happy.
You
can wash your car, but I would suggest using a warm soapy water.  Do not

use any kind of chemicals on the paint.  We do not recommend using
chemicals on our product.  Honestly, it should be fine.  The only
suggestion that I have is to make sure that you wait the proper drytimes

between priming, recoating and topcoating.  If I can help you with other

questions, please let me know.

   Sincerely,
   Nicole Palmer-Ball
