Subject: RE: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

&gt; Ok, still working on friend's 77 automatic. 
&gt;  I was just wondering if anyone else knew of a 
&gt; later edition Bentley, or anything else, because
&gt; the one I have isn't helpful at all.


I have something that may be just what you need. This is an official VW
publication that was provided to their dealership service departments in
1977, specifically covering the 1976-1977 auto trans for the Type 2,
Rabbit, and Audi Fox. It includes step by step troubleshooting, part
failure diagnosis, operating checks, specifications, adjustments, and
illustrations of the components and valve assembly. It's about 20 pages
long and very informative.  I have two copies left, at $9.95 each.
