&gt; 34 ICT's are pretty small carbs, aren't they?  What size engine do you have
&gt; 1800 Type IV?  What type of muffler, stock -- or did you go to a larger
&gt; after market?

--&gt; Sorry for not including more detail.  It's a 1970cc Type IV.  The
muffler is a rusted-out piece of crap Monza-style thing installed by the
PO...the exhaust system leaks like a seive, which is the next thing I plan
to fix, if I ever get this problem solved.

&gt; 
&gt; Sounds to me like you are running real lean... rejetting -- what is your
&gt; Main Jet?  Have you even checked?

--&gt; Haven't checked yet...how difficult is it?  I know I need to take the
tops off the carbs, but what then?  I've never taken a carb apart before.
I'm beginning to wonder if the jets are gummed up...the carbs were pulled
off a working engine, but sat for a while, or so I'm told.

&gt; 
&gt; Then, learning on &quot;used&quot; isn't much fun either -- especially when you are
&gt; learning :)

--&gt; So I'm finding.  Maybe I would have been better off to go with a new
progressive (new duals are out of my price range.)
