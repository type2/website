&gt; Anyway, to the purpose of this posting-why are the bay busses so lowly
&gt; regarded by the rest of the VW enthusiasts?   Any ideas?  And does anyone

Hi, I think your perception simply comes from having hung out with the
&quot;wrong&quot; people. Older VW's are scarcer, therefore more valuable to those in
quest for exclusivity. (I won't dispute that a splitty also a charm of its
own.) 

I seems to me that there are 3 major factors that will determine which old
type 2 you'll drive: Form, Funktion, and Finanzen. Your choice will simply
reflect a different (relative) compromise among those 3 things. And since
they are VW's, the compromises are never big ones.
