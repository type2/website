&gt;I put a set of dual dellorto carbs on it after a top end rebuild and 
&gt;have no experience with dual carbs. The issue is that they pop....
&gt;like fuel starvation pop....it also diesels badly after turning off the 
&gt;motor. I do realize they have to be synched and have been 
&gt;attempting that for the past few days....However I've not been able 
&gt;to get it anywhere near running corectly. Consensus is that its 

I don't know anything about Dells (I run dual Webers), but what you describe
sounds exactly like intake leaks.  Did you use gaskets and/or sealant
between the manifolds and the heads?  

To check for air leaks, start the engine and get it idling then carefully
spray some carb cleaner around each manifold base.  If the idle changes,
there is an air leak there.  Spray lightly because you want the stuff to be
sucked into the leaks more as a vapor.  If you saturate the area, wipe it
off and try again.  You can also check the area where the carbs bolt to the
manifolds with the same method.

Hope this helps.
