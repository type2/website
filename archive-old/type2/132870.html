Subject: RE: [T2] Brake resevoir to mastercylinder hose/tube '71

John,

i had this happen to me on a 74 when i replaced the MC. the tubing broke
apart when i took it off.

you might try bustedbus_dot_com if you can't find a new one.

but most important, be careful to use something that is made specifically
for brake fluid. you don't want that tube falling apart after its had brake
fluid in it for a while.

good luck,
