Hello again!

First of all, thank you to those of you who responded to my original post.
I've narrowed down my search to 3 tires.  Because I want to stick with
185R14 size tires (I don't want to subsitute them with 195/75R14 tires), I
find that I'm sort of limited to what's available out there.  By the way, I
think I'm safe to get C load range tires (vs. D).  C load range tires (in
185R14 size) should be sufficient to handle up to a 6000 lb. load.  I don't
think I'll be loading up my 71' westy to make it exceed 6000 lbs.   So here
are the tires that I'm looking at (all are availalble at Tire Rack):

1.  Bridgestone 603V (C or D load)
2.  Michelin MX Reinforced
3.  Yokohama Y356 (C or D load)

Between these three tires, which one can I expect to handle the best on wet
roads and on non-paved roads (dirt and gravel).  I've not been able to find
an all weather, all terrain light truck tires in a size 185R14.  Light truck
highway rib tires seem to be my only choice.

Thanks.
Leo
