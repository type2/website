My engine hatch door seal, that is!

Hiya Listerinos,

I bought an engine hatch seal from West Coast Metrics to replace my old worn 
out model.  The seal from WCM comes in four parts.  Presumably one is 
supposed to tailor the four parts to fit the seal channel and install.  My 
problem is that I cannot cut a good 45 degree angle in this hollow rubber 
material. I've tried using all sorts of cutting devices.  The results have 
been less than spectacular. I'm pretty much convinced at this juncture that 
I'm going to need some sort of very sharp power device to do a good job.  I 
think.
Now I know somebody else out there has already done this little job.  How did 
you get it done and cut good 45 degree corners?

Thanks All!
