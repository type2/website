&gt;I just saw a bus (a loaf) the other day that had a velvet paint job. I 
&gt;don't know how many of you remember this paint, but it was rather 
&gt;unique. It came out in the early 70s. You'd spray on a base coat, then 
&gt;overshoot it with &quot;velvet&quot;... and the end result was something suitable 
&gt;for Elvis' Last Supper.
&gt;
&gt;This van was painted in day-glo blue. I don't know how he kept the 
&gt;finish alive. It can't be waxed, and it deteriorates quickly. I suppose 
&gt;the van has been lying covered in someone's garage since it was painted 
&gt;25 years ago.

Speaking of keeping the finish alive, how about spraying a contact
cement and then grass seed?  Chia-bus!  Also, they make those flower
bed assortments in rolls that you just roll out over your flower bed...
You could glue one of those to the roof of your bus.  Who needs a
vase on the dashboard?
