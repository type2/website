Subject: Re: [T2] stripped bolt....

I assume that you are referring to bolts where the muffler mounts to the
heater boxes. They always strip ... Usually I take a small sharp chisel
to split the nut. Once it is split, it comes off easily and due to the
increase in diameter your socket/wrench will fit again.
