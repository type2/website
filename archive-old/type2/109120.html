Subject: BusDepot_dot_com Beta Test - SITE DOWN

Due to technical difficulties, the test site has been down all day.

I was out for the day and only learned this recently. It will probably
be morning before it is up again. This means that we will extend the
test period until at least tomorrow afternoon. I will post another
message when the test site is back up.

Thanks to everyone who has already sent feedback! I am making the
changes many of you recommended right now!
