Hi Bob,

Someone had an idea a while back to get an original AC setup, and  
find a domestic alternator of the correct size to replace the AC  
pump . That would give you a dual-alternator system and a LOT of  
spare juice to run the AC.

OTOH... converting rotational force into electrical energy that will  
be used to spin a motor doesn't make sense to me. Too many  
conversions wastes power, and there isn't all that much HP there to  
start with.

One thing we haven't heard from Shad is what year bus he has.  
Throwing that load at a stock early bay engine might be a wee bit  
optimistic.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; #5. AC unit.  The under-dash units don't thrill me.  They seem to  
&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt; work well for the driver/passenger, and they're expensive as  
&gt;&gt; heck.  I'm
&gt;&gt; currently searching for a unit from an RV (in the 8-12K BTU range) to
&gt;&gt; strip down and mount in the passenger side of the engine compartment.
&gt;&gt; Run the condenser coil underneath the bus, run the evaporator coil to
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the front, add a blower/controls/etc.   Probably have to step up to a
&gt;&gt; 95A alternator to pull it all, and add an idle kick-up selenoid.
&gt;
&gt; let us know where you find a 95A unit that will fit and show us how  
&gt; you
&gt; got it in there
