To Dr Tim &amp; list-
Gotta inject data at the opposite extreme -we have to learn from
successes as well as failures (like those long lived Russians that ate
yogurt).
- at 210,000 my 78 Westy has NEVER had the engine rebuilt- I'm sure
people are waiting with bated breath my report of of something like
throwing a rod!   Engine was out ONCE at 150k mi to check clutch before
an around the country trip in '95.  Replaced friction disk, which still
looked good, and front engine seals.  Lifters were changed around 110K
as I recall.  Most of its life the thermostat cable wasn't attached (I
put it on at 150K after reading the Hoover stuff)... People stare in
wonderment that it's still purring back there- so do I....I am not a
&quot;keep it at 55 and drive it only in summer&quot; person, driving it at 65 a
lot, even up to 80 downhill.  I DO never let it lug (chug along at at
least 3,000rpm up hills), do change the oil/filter about every 3K, and
it runs rich based on exhaust pipe end.  Oil temp is about 250 when it's
95 out.  I started using TUFOIL additive (moly-PTFE extra-fine
suspension additive proven to double life of warehouse engines in
forklifts)....at 60K when I got the bus, and milage jumped from 20 to
22.  It's down to 18 now, and compression is 135.  So what did I do
right- were these simply crack resistant heads, or would the TUFOIL help
any?
