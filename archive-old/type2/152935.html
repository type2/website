Subject: Re: [T2] Brittle wire in engine bay

Dear Don,

Good, the tubing you're was what I thought about going for..... You
EGR looks lovely and clean. Mine has been re welded and I am missing
the pipe heading south next to the vaccum pipe that goes via rubber to
the air thermostat......... It's good to see another one in an image
and not on a fiche.

yours

Charles

&gt; You sure you're not talking about an old Volvo? ;-)

&gt; I've had good luck over the years with high quality electrical tape
&gt; wrapped around the wires as well as various plastic wire loom
&gt; products.
