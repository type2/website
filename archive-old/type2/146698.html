Subject: Parkerizing

It's not a coating, but still could wear through?

Parkerizing (sometimes called phosphating) is a method of protecting 
steel surfaces from corrosion and thus increasing their durability. It 
is commonly used on weapons as an alternative to bluing, and is 
considered more effective than bluing. It is ineffective on non-ferrous 
surfaces such as aluminum, and on stainless steel.

The process involves dipping the metal into an acid solution whose 
active ingredient is zinc. The solution is brought to a temperature of 
about 190-2100F for a period ranging between five and 45 minutes, while 
the metal is submerged; this results in a non-reflective, gray finish. 
Another method uses manganese instead of zinc for a blacker finish. It 
is different from coating the metalthe steel reacts with the zinc and 
the treated finish is thus part of the metal.

Parkerizing is considerably less efficient at preventing corrosion 
unless the treated surface is kept covered with a light coating of oil 
(a heavy coating is unnecessary and undesirable).

The method was developed for the United States military during World War 
II by the Parker Company. Parkerized was originally a registered 
trademark of the Parker Company.
