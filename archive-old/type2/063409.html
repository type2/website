Subject: Luggage rack interchangability

Hi all, I have a full length roof rack on my '66 Westy with the middle
bars cut out for the pop-top (I got it that way so don't yell at me) and I
was wondering if I can use it on my '73 bus (no pop-top).  It has four
legs on each side which sit in the gutter.  Come to think of it, is there
anyone who knows where I could get some decent hold-down clamps for this
thing?  Right now I just have some nylon straps and I don't trust them too
much.  Thanks.
