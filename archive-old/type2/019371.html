I agree. Brakes have always been one of my favorite jobs, even when I worked
in a shop. They are very straightforward.. Electrical has always been my
nemisis.

It's a good idea to remove and replace parts from one side at time for
comparison if you haven't done many, and be sure to use secure stands.
