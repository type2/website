&gt; The best advice I got for this, which won't help you now but will the next
&gt; time your changing plugs, is to tape your socket to your wrench. This is the
&gt; only reason that I didn't lose my socket down there. 

I went a bit further, and welded an extension to a spark plug socket
(removed the rubber stuff first, reinstalled it when done) the whole
thing is now too long to go clear inside, and the socket doesn't come
off the extension when pulling it out after installing the plug!  Cheap
extensions are a buck at K-Mart etc. and a cheap spark-plug socket is
about the same.

HTH. . .  for next time?  :&lt;)
