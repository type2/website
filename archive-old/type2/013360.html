Subject: WR-1 Starter Relay Install Probs/Q&amp;A

Ok,
Today I bought a WR1 Bosch starter relay kit for my bus, whose starter has
become frustratingly unreliable.  I'm in the process of trying the get the
sucker in, and am not having an easy time.  (How anyone can do this in
20-30 minutes - as I've read - just blows me away.)  The connections are
not a problem - its the mounting of the relay unit that's hanging me up. 
The instructions, as well as some people on the list, say to drill a hole
in the bus &quot;near the starter&quot; and use a sheet metal screw to attach the
thing.  The thing is, I cannot figure out where this hole should go.  There
is a slanted corrugated (metal?) surface towards the front of the bus from
where the starter is mounted, similar (in both surface and location) to the
slanted metal inside the bus behind &amp; beneath where the rear seat is -- is
this the general area under the bus where people are drilling and mounting
their relays (and if not, where)?  I thought this general area seemed
nervously close to where the fuel tank is, and I wanted to make sure before
just haphazardly drilling a hole wherever.  And even if this is the right
place, I barely have enough room to get my arms and a drill up and in there
in order to get a nice perpendicular hole put in - so that made me
location-skeptical as well.  So, if anyone can provide any definitive
guidance on the mounting process, I'd sure appreciate it.  

(On a related note, I would rather not drill a hole in the bus altogether -
is it possible/recommended to mount the relay unit somewhere else without
having to drill, say on the starter itself or something?)

One more: I can find nowhere near the starter on the actual body frame to
attach a ground wire down under there - no existing screws to use, nothing.
 Can anyone suggest any alternative spots down there (tranny bolt? engine
tin screw? etc.) on which to connect a ground?  Thank you!!!
