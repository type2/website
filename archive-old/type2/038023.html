Dear List, 

I decided to finally hack away at the cab floor in the 73 westy and remove
the cancer. The price of parts, living in Spain and with a .really. bad
exchange rate, does make purchasing a new floor much of an option, so I'm
gonna fabricate a replacement (sounds easy if you type it quickly!). One
big area of doubt though is refitting the acc. hinge and pin in the correct
position. If I cut out the hinge and pin, which really do need to be
replaced, how can i be sure of re-welding back into the right position. I
know measure and measure... but it makes me uneasy. Any words of wisdom??

Cheers
