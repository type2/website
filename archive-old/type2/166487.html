Subject: Re: [T2] How many fuel filters?

Not really.

&gt;I know I need to replace all the fuel lines and I found the article in the
&gt;library by Shawn Luft titled &quot;Fuel Line Replacement - '74 and Earlier Bus w/
&gt;Single Carburetor&quot;.....is it really that easy to do?  Are there any gotchas
&gt;I should know before starting?

There is more than 1 size of fuel hose which can complicate the job if you are not prepared. I've tried to capture as much of the info as I can to help you get started. Of course, you should examine the hoses you have to deal with PO modifications that may have been made.

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/FuelHoses.html

Always use metric sized hose because the fittings are metric. Not only is USA hose the wrong size the rubber compounds are poor and the rubber goes hard prematurely.

Replacing the fuel line coming from the tank can be messy if it's not empty. To drain the tank you can either try to pump it out of the fuel filler opening ($3 hand pump) but the method I prefer is to hook up an electric pump (FI buses have an advantage in this area) and pump the gas into another tank (portable or car) by powering the pump without trying to start the engine.

Once the tank is dryish you can replace every hose and clean the removable filter in the tank (pre-FI models). If you don't want to replace the hose coming from the tank because you can't get the fuel out, you'll need a fuel line clamp.

Good quality fuel line clamps (not just sutably sized worm gear clamps) will keep the hose tight on the fittings without cutting through it.

Anytime a hose is passing through a metal bulkhead or fitting, it needs to be insulated by grommet or wrap-around hose. If not, the vibration against the metal will very slowly but surely saw through it over time and you'll eventually have a fuel leak on a hot engine.
