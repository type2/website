Holy cow, guys. I have a tennant who is an authorized eberspacher
dealer. Who on the list would be interested in a group purchase if I
can get him to import some of the &quot;petrol&quot; models?

&gt; The heater I had in my 78 worked great.
&gt; I drove it back from Edmonton one winter in -41 Celcius
&gt; I was soo darn cold it wasn't funny. Wind blowing snow
&gt; all over the place you couldn't see. It was putting out good
&gt; heat but the wind was stripping it off the bus faster than it
&gt; would put it out. I was in my insulated coveralls and over that
&gt; I had an army sleeping bag good to -50ish or something.
&gt; I was sooo cold it wasn't funny.
