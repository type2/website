Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch slowly going- WHY?

Classic symptom of the cable breaking.  You are probably down to just a
few strands.  Replace it _now_ before it breaks and you lose the adjusting
nut.  Lube the new cable generously as it goes in, and take the
opportunity to disassemble and lube the clutch pedal pivot.

&gt; I've been having to push the clutch pedal lower and lower to the
&gt; floor for it to disengage. I have adjusted the cable twice now, and
&gt; it's good after that, but after a couple days, it's back to being
&gt; bad. This all happened after my accelerator cable broke while I was
&gt; downtown, so I had to use a rubber band to keep the carb open, about
&gt; 3k at idle. I was able to drive home, but I had to eat alot of
&gt; clutch. Then the clutch problems started. I originally thought that
&gt; it is my clutch wearing thin, but the more I think about it, it seems
&gt; like it's only the cable that needs replacing. It DOES NOT slip when
&gt; in gear, it's just hard to get it into gear and it feels like I need
&gt; to push the pedal farther than it can go to get the clutch to
&gt; disengage. Any thoughts?
&gt; Thanks
