Subject: Rear Tail Light Lens

Well ski season has come to a end and it is time to work on the bus!  I will
be starting with Tune Up, Compression Test, Adjust Valves,  Changing belt,
checking breaks and taking it from their.  My list grows daily.

Hey can anyone recomend who sells a good replacement lens from?  I am looking
for a right one for a 78, both cover and bulb holder?  I replaced the left one
several years ago and while the lense cover is still in good shape the bulb
holders are not.  Would like to replace the right one with something that
holds up longer.
Thanks
