Subject: 78 Bus 2 Liter AVP rebuild. Valves &amp; Compression questions

Hi Guys,

I spent a good half hour talking with Erin at AVP about a new engine for my '78 bus. FWIW she =
definately knows a bit about VW engines.=20

The engine I have now actually has zero compression in cylinder 1, and is on its last legs. This =
diagnosis was confirmed by my mechanic and I am riding my motorcycle until I can put in the new =
engine.

I run a stock fuel-injected, hydraulic lifter engine. Erin says that they can put the larger =
valves from the earlier years (41mm intake etc) into the heads and run the compression a little =
higher than stock 7.8:1 rather than 7.5:1 and that this will produce a few more horsepower. They =
do most of their engines stock, but this is what they would recommend for mild performance without =
sacrificing longevity.

My mechanic says that the bigger valves won't make any difference on a fuel injected engine. I'm =
curious if any listees have ordered this combination from AVP and what their experience was.

Thanks much!

Mark
