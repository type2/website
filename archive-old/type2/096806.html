Subject: bringing a vehicle from the US into Canada

off topic...

anybody from Canada (Ontario??) know the routine for bringing a vehicle
from the US into Canada? (this one's a motorcycle, but it should be the
same). 

i.e. How does the border cross/registration/licensing work? 

Could I go into the US, buy a vehicle, and then ride it back home to
Toronto? 

cheers
