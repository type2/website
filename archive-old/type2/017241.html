Actually, it's not that hard.

You start the engine, (use which ever hand you want)
Put one hand on the throttle, the timing light in the other
and do the test.
A little off??  Use the nose of the timing light to 'bump' the dizzy
on one of the side clips to move it and you don't have to take your
hand off the throttle.

Be gentle, it works.

&gt; Greetings...
&gt;
&gt; I'm in the process of trying to set my total advance and have a bit of a
&gt; logistics problem...
&gt;
&gt; How does one maintain 3000 rpms, hold the timing light, and rotate the dizzy
&gt; with only two hands?
&gt;
&gt; What's the trick?  Do you get a partner, or can this be done easily with
&gt; only myself...?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
