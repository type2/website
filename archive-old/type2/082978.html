Subject: Plat Cat or Propex vented propane heaters

I have been thinking about getting a vented propane heater 
and the two names that come up are the Propex 1600 HeatSource 
and the Platinum Cat 3P12 or 6P12. Anyone like one over the 
other? I want to be able to use it while the vehicle is in 
motion (My BA6 just isn't working right and I am getting 
frustrated trying to troubleshoot it). I also want to be able 
to use it for cold weather camping.

Thanks,
Chris
