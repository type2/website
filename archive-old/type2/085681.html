Subject: Tubes are bent

TGIF:

Condition:  I bent/creased/hacked a push rod tube while removing it with my 
favorite set of vice grips.

Solution:  I took straight lug wrench (the kind you pick up at junk yards) 
and c-clamped the elbowed/socketed end, clamped flat on my work bench, with 
the pointy end about 8 inches over the edge, pointing at my belly. (I'm 
really short, with a tubby belly)

Then I slip the bent/creased/hacked push rod tube over the leg of the lug 
wrench, and tap ever so slightly with my light duty hammer.

Started at the edges of the crease, and just worked the edges until there 
were no more edges.  At that point, there was no more bent/creased/hacked 
push rod tube, but a nicely formed tube.

The metal inside the tube does NOT have to be very thick for this to work.  
It is the loving patience that makes it work.

This might help on a bent bowden tube, if you can secure the metal, or have 
enough patience to accept imperceptible progress.
