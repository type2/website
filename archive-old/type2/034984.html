Subject: RE:  tdc?

&gt;is top dead center (tdc) the same on all 72-79 type iv's???

That sounds like a trick question.  TDC is always TDC - the point at which
the piston is at the fullly extended length of it's stroke.  But I know what
you mean :-).

&gt;my timing scale reads tdc different than where it truly is.  i 
&gt;pulled a spark plug #1 and felt exactly where tdc was.  for 
&gt;me the notch in my fan pulley lined perfectly vertical (like on
&gt;the old upright motors), 

You did right!  That is the best/easiest (only?) way to accurately determine
TDC on an installed engine (any engine, VW or otherwise).  Anybody who
doesn't absolutely positively know where their TDC is should follow this
simple procedure.  

Just pull your distributor cap and rotate your engine (I use a crescent
wrench on the alternator nut) until the business end of your distributor
rotor (the end with the metal piece on it) is pointing toward the tiny
little notch on the upper rim of your distributor body (if you can see it,
run your fingernail around the top edge of the rim and you should be able to
feel it).  Then pull the spark plug from cylinder #1 and stick a pencil or
wooden dowel in the hole (don't stick it in there unless it's at least 6 or
8 inches long so you won't loose it!!).  If you did the first part of this
correctly, it should only go in a very short way.  Then rotate the engine to
and fro a little while watching the pencil move up and down.  When it is at
the absolutely highest point you can achieve, that's TDC.

&gt;yet my scale reads tdc, like 2 inches over to the left.  

Now to the meat of your question:  There are lots of different fans that
were used on different years and different type IV-powered vehicles.  Some
have notches at 0, some at 5 degrees, some at 7.5 degrees, and the Lord
knows where else.  The timing scale is very useful to set your timing with a
non-adjustable strobe-style timing light.  

Some timing lights have an adjustment on them for advance - you just dial in
27 degrees and get the timing mark at 0 TDC at about 3000 RPM.  But other
lights don't have this nice little feature (and they're less expensive
too!).  If you have one without the adjustment, the timing scale found on
most type IV motors is wonderful because you just get the timing mark at 27
degrees on the scale (to the left of 0).

The fan on my 73 has a notch that lines up exactly with the 0 mark on the
timing scale.  But I also painted a bright red line on the fan where it
lines up with the center of the case (since I have one of the nifty
adjustable timing lights).

Hope this clears up any confusion or questions about finding TDC.
