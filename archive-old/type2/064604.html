I just don't understand those dealers.  You can get rebuild kits for the
dual Solexes for under $20 each from Vee Parts in San Diego.  But really,
there isn't much to go wrong on them.  A good cleaning will probably fix
things.  For $800 each, I'll give you my rebuilt carbs, fly out to wherever
you are, install them, fill your bus with gas, and buy you a steak dinner!
