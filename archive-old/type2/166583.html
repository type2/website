Subject: RE: [T2] Front Wheel Bearings

It's easy, any of the VW books will explain it (even
the idiot's guide). You could basically just take it
apart and put it back together the same way.

You'll need a bearing set and a seal for each wheel,
IIRC.

This would be a good time time to measure your brake
rotor thickness...if it's close to the limit you may
as well replace it since you're doing all the
necessary work anyway.

You will probably want to heat the hub in your oven to
expand it before installing the new bearing races.

Make SURE that the races are facing the right
direction before installing them in the hub...if they
go in wrong the angle of the race will prevent you
from removing them (without a machine shop).

Tightening the axle nut when you're done takes a
little technique...the washer under the nut should be
slightly moveable with a screwdriver.  A tiny little
bit of play is neccesary.
