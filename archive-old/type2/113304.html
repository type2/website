&lt;&lt; Considering that selfishness is a characteristic and a motivation that is

born into every living creature, that is simply the best point to work from.

Let everyone provide for themselves, and give them the freedom to do it. We

are creative and productive and talented enough to do it. We just need

government to stand aside and let us.

And I know, that VW and other big corporations are like the wide trees that

give shade, food, shelter, and solace to all manner of creatures. They

provide industry and exchange; they make products to make our lives more

satisfying... and they pay the taxes and put food on the table for workers

and for those who can no longer work. Is that such a bad thing? &gt;&gt;

That includes Enron, Global Crossing, The various energy companies involved
in the California energy fraud, Bechtel, Halliburton Ind. , Brown, Root, and
Kellog...et al...?-(
And the golden parachutes at American Airlines...
BTW, you might ask Eliot Spitzer (NY state attorney general) how he feels 
about those big trees...
