Subject: Re: [T2] fuel sender

I'd think a hatch kit would stick up and interfere with the mattress in
a Westy?  I've had a sender problem for years in the 78 Westy; I take
the gas receipt and write the milage on it and stick it in the ashtray. 
I'll be induced to fix it when the speedo goes (:
On the 75 I'm fixing up, there is a real professional job where they
used a piece of donor bus decking as a cover (inch larger all around
than the hole) and screwed it down very flush.  Now I gotta ask, as this
bus presumably has 60K miles, why did it need a new sender
(and it has a wrecked 2nd gear)....we've been through how to tell miles
on a bus, and other criteria (sliding door glider, bushing in shifter
train, amount of feder well dings, all points to low milage!
