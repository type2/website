Sharon:

Some of the most common causes of overheating are:

* Missing or damaged cooling tin
* Missing or damaged heater hoses
* Missing seals (spark plug, or engine surround seals)
* Incorrect timing
* Lean jetting
* Something stuck in the fan
* Compression too high
* Slipping fan belt
* Thermostat shutters not fully opening
* Leaking intake manifold boots

Thank You!

&gt; Help,
&gt; I have a 70 Bus with a 1776 engine. I bought the engine new 1200 miles
&gt; ago. Everything was going fine until recently when the engine started
&gt; running extremely hot
