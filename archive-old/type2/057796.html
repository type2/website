My bus shows 80K on the clock, and I have no illusions that the bus has
less than 100K on it.  In fact, my question is whether it has 180K or 280K
(380K?).  We're talking a '76 westy deluxe here.

- The motor was recently rebuilt.
- I had to have the entire front suspension and steering rebuilt when i got
it--heavily worn.
- Got a bit of butt-sag.
- No rust, but pretty faded point (SoCal bus).
- Chipped and worn cabinetry.
- Front seats redone with green vinyl-only covers (yuck).
- rear seat foam very flat and rather, uh, dead.
- Badly-cut holes in rear deck for both fuel sender and... uh... fuel
filler pipe?
- shift linkage very loose, rattles, and is generally noisy.
- Windshield really, really chipped with about 25 bazillion tiny tiny
little micro chips that you don't really see until you're driving into the
sun--then it becomes very hard to see out.
- all window seals dry, rotted, and some have simply crumbled away.
- carpet very worn--there's a hole clean through the rear carpet where one
steps when coming in through the sliding door.

So: what're the chances the odometer's rolled more than once already?
Opinions?

-76 westy with 180, 280, 380, or 480 K?
