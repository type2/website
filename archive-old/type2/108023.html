Subject: Re: [T2] VW Hippie Bashing

Todd, you're NOT the only Republican on the list.
You said it well!
Capitalism is just the best way of sharing the good things and spreading the
love.
AIRS is an exception, an anomaly. Most people can't or won't do something
for nothing. (Then again, some people love VW buses enough to want to keep
them around, and the payback that they get from helping owners can't be
measured in dollars but does have a value!)
Considering that selfishness is a characteristic and a motivation that is
born into every living creature, that is simply the best point to work from.
Let everyone provide for themselves, and give them the freedom to do it. We
are creative and productive and talented enough to do it. We just need
government to stand aside and let us.
And I know, that VW and other big corporations are like the wide trees that
give shade, food, shelter, and solace to all manner of creatures. They
provide industry and exchange; they make products to make our lives more
satisfying... and they pay the taxes and put food on the table for workers
and for those who can no longer work. Is that such a bad thing?
