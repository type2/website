Martin,
	Are you sure it was the trans?  Did you eyeball the pilot bearing?  Check 
the fluid level?  How about the rear wheel bearings?  I have had similar 
symptoms that led me to believe I had a bad trans as well.  It turned out to 
be one of the other things, every time.

My 1/50th of a buck.

Eron
