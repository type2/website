&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat. That
&gt; &gt; stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I have
&gt; &gt; personally seen explode at a tire shop while getting new tire mounted.  &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses it
&gt; &gt; on his strictly farm-used pickup and swears by it. Just curious about
&gt; &gt; street use...
&gt;
&gt; wouldn't touch the stuff with a ten foot pole, would drive on the flat
&gt; first, it does less damage to the tire!!!!  (and I know from first hand
&gt; experience)

Well, tell us your experience, don't just slam the product!  How can Slime
damage a tire?  The only negatives that I've found about Slime in over a
decade of use are:

1. It only seals punctures in the tread area.
2. You cannot patch a slime-treated tire or tube.  the patches don't
stick, and it removes existing patches.
3. If you let a Slime-sealed puncture sit for a few weeks without driving,
the seal tends to dry out and start a slow leak.  Daily-driven vehicles
don't have this problem, and if it happens you just spin the wheel and it
is sealed again.

Now, there are various brands of tire sealants, and I'm only talking about
the brand-name &quot;Slime&quot; product.  Others may be worse or better.
