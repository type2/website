&gt; &gt; Would this solve this problem? It seems I have seen the bug exhaust work for
&gt; &gt; others. Is it a 1969 thing?
&gt;
&gt; Nope..its a bus thing.  The traditional method of making a bug muffer fit
&gt; involves one of two things.
&gt;
&gt; a: add cutouts to the bumper.
&gt;
&gt; b: stand on the tailpipes till the muffler fits.

I had a bug muffler on my '71 for quite a while.  Everything fit, even
with larger-than-stock peashooters on it.  Switched to a real bus muffler
when I swapped engines.  I doubt that the '71 is much different from a '69
in this respect.


&gt; of course, the correct thing to do is to use a bus muffler...if your hatch
&gt; seal is anything except perfect, you can expect to suck exhaust fumes into
&gt; the interior of the bus with the bug muffler.

The reason I went to a bus muffler.  Never had any fumes, but always
though about it.
