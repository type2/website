Subject: Re: [T2] looking for THIS hose - see pic

Hmmm.. Do you think that this is a job for duct tape? Friction tape would
probably do better in the warm engine compartment and it would look more
&quot;stock&quot; if you did a good job. You could mummify that hose and if necessary
put some big hose clamps on the end so they seal well.. I'm facing the same
problem, more or less. And NONE of those big overhead hoses are available
anymore.

&gt; That molded hose is NLA. I am still looking for a replacement for mine.
The
&gt; ID is 22mm. The largest metric vacuum hose Ive been able to find is 17mm.
If
&gt; you could find a stout enough 13/16 or close smog hose that would work
also.
