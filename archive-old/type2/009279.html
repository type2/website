Marv Krupps asked me to forward this:

Was out camping in cheapie homemade &quot;Westy&quot; on Friday, so:

Capt. USN, (ret), former enlisted Marine. Last 25 of 32 years service, as 
Naval Flight Officer, (F-4's/F-14's) off various carriers, both coasts. 
Retired from Pentagon 13 years ago to take up six too many hobbies. V-dubbs 
are winning out...have time for almost nothing else now...or so sez SO.

Marv Krupp 74&quot;Westy&quot;/72 Hightop/71 SC/68 DC/63 Notchback ...and a 
mind-boggeling To-Do list..
