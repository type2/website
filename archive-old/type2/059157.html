Subject: RE: Plug Socket, Dist, Points

	Hey Ben,
	   I found a deep socket with a rubber insert which grips the
end of  the Spark
	Plug so it doesnt fall into those convenient places.


&gt;  I was able to do that using a piece of looped wire and hooking the
&gt; bent electrode and slowly pulling them out (Don't ask why I didn't
&gt; have my handy magnet tool). Now my qyestion is how the hell I'm
&gt; supposed to get them back in?! Is there such a thing as a magnetized
&gt; socket for these things? Did I buy the wrong tool?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any guidance you can give,
&gt;
