Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky Valve Covers

I don't get it. I just wipe oil on both sides of the gasket and
everything stays nice and leak free until the next oil change. What's
with all this goop ya'll are putting on?

;-)

I use the thicker cork gaskets that are bought in bulk. Not the ones
that come in a fancy paper box. Dip my fingers in oil and just smear
it around. Of course I change my oil AT LEAST every 3k miles, and
valves get done at the same time. So maybe they wouldn't last long
term.
