Subject: Hot VW's Photo Shoot.

well, it finally took place.  last saturday, i got together with RK Smith
(Hot VW's feature editor), Charlie Hamill and Rich Kimball and tooks some
photo's of our bus's for a upcomming feature.  

the shoots that will be feature are of my 60 crew cab and charlie's 63
crew cab.  his is a factory terqoise crew that has undergone a $25,000
full resto. (you could use his bed and gates as a mirror if you needed to)
both bus's were shot individually and together using a local Barn (yes, in
huntington beach) as a back drop.  i must say that they looked great
together.  pictures of both were taken up close and from afar.  

Rich Kimball came by with his 57 panalvan and we also took photo's of all
3 together.  they will not be in the mag like that, but they were thinking
of useing those shots for a calender some time.  

i can't wait to see what they look like.  i took my own set of photo's as
well as my dad.  i think the photographer shot 7 roles all together.  i am
not sure what month that they will come out in is yet, but when i find out
i will let you all know.  please let me know what you all think when it
does apear.

Take care and God Bless
