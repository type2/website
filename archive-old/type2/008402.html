&gt; My local Goodyear tire place has a 50% off sale ($55/tire) on leftover
&gt; Infinitread tires, has 8 in the size I use, 195-75R14, and I was
impressed
&gt; with the rather high pressure rating: 44psi...the rest of the tire is
&gt; similar to the Michelin Roadhandlers I've used for 200k MILES Load
&gt; capacity- 1400 lbs, 3ply tread (1P2S), 1ply sidewall (claims it's
thicker
&gt; to get the pressure rating), better milage warantee (over 70K, has
very
&gt; deep tread with four circumferential grooves that are fairly wide, are
&gt; marked Mud &amp; Snow, Traction A, Treadwear B.  I believe they were
waranteed
&gt; to last over 75K mi.

These are probably load range C tires, which don't have enough weight
capacity to meet the VW specification in this size.  The VW spec is
1520 pounds.

Load range D tires usually have 2-ply sidewalls.  C rated tires can
have either 1- or 2-ply sidewalls.

I'd hold out for 2-ply sidewalls.  The extra stiffness really improves
directional stability in a bus.

The price quoted isn't all that good.  I recall that I paid about the
same for 185R14 D-rated Bridgestones out the door last summer.  If the
$55 price isn't mounted and balanced you're not going to save anything
on this &quot;sale&quot;.  You pay a lot for the &quot;Goodyear&quot; name!

You likely know my opinions re: 185R14 vs. 195/75R14, so I won't bore
you with it again!  :)
