Subject: Question about welding

Whenever I see articles or write-ups about replacing full panels, the 
work always seems to be done with brazing or by cutting the seams from 
the replacement panel and welding the panel in as a giant patch. I've 
never seen anyone do a replacement by spot welding. Why not? Why aren't 
more repairs done by restoring the original welding style?
