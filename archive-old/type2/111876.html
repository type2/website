Subject: rear sway bar on a '70 bus..

i have what i believe to be something like a sway bar,
i dont know if this is factory or aftermarket..

this is located on the back axle.

my concern is that the drivers side apparently isnt
hooked up, and there is no bracket for it..

is anyone faintly familar with what im trying to
describe?

thanx,

rob
