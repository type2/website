Subject: Body Shop in MA?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Anyone have any recommendations for a good body shop near Cambridge/Boston
MA?  I have a '73 Bus that needs his nose banged out, rockers replaced, and
a decent paint job.  I would take him to Maaco for the paint and nose, but
would like to have someone familiar with VWs do the rockers.  I'd do it
myself but I have neither the space nor the tools.  One day I will, but in
the meantime?

Thanks,

Jeff Brock
