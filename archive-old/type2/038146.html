&gt; I think y'all should bring it up the east coast some, we volks here in
&gt; Delaware and Maryland will be glad to bring it along the beach area, I
&gt; know A LOT of people that would be mad interested in it.

Yes, but you see, it STARTED up North on the East coast and has already been 
through MA, RI, CT, PA, VA, MD, TN, GA, FL, and possibly NC and SC as well.  
I'm not saying it should not go back through there again, but I think it should 
make a trip around the country first.  That was the idea anyway.  So lets get 
the thing into some states it hasn't been to yet.
