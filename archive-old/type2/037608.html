Subject: Re: [heat shield] &amp; Dansk muffler

Yes, type IV powered busses have heat shields.  Good thing too, since 
without them the stock muffler tends to cook the foam engine compartment 
seal.  BTW, I recently had the same problem with a new Dansk 
sausage-muffler hitting the oil filler tube.  I am going to widen the holes 
in the mating flange, since it shouldn't take much to fix the problem.  The 
studs supplied with the muffler were also too long.  The muffler also isn't 
as quiet as I thought it should be.  Bottom line, I wish I'd forked out the 
extra $40 or so for the Leistritz muffler.

&gt;Heat sheild?  I saw one of these in the busboys' catalog in the cooling tin

&gt;
&gt;Is this part just on type1 busses?  I don't think we type4 people have this,
&gt;or all mine have been missing...

&gt;TIA for info,

&gt; &gt; Yes, Virginia -- it *is* possible to install a heat shield *after*
&gt; &gt; installing your muffler (d'oh!). It's a little tricky, but it *can* be
&gt; &gt; done. AMHIK....
