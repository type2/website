Subject: Cooling tin

Hi All. I am replacing the engine compartment gasket in my 70 westy, too
help keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool. The piece of tin at the
rear of the engine ( I think its called a Breast Plate) is in very bad
shape. Are these available? I have seen plenty for Bugs but none for Busses
(They look the same in the catalogs). Do I have to hit a junkyard for this?
Thanks in advance.

Jeff and &quot;schlampig&quot;
