Subject: October 71 Bus

My 72 westy has a October  1971 sticker on it. I know the model year
started off in August but I was wondering if mine would be considered an
early 72, at what point did they say 72 1/2 ? March of 72?
The reason for asking is I had ordered front emblem clips for the 72, it
said 72-78 I think, however they are not the right clips, I then found
that a front emblem in WCM says it's for 68-72 1/2 , so it's these clips
I need, right? My emblem was behind the seat and all clips where gone so
I have none to compare to. I had read in the archives where someone used
#8 blue wall anchors for their clip, however my holes where to big and
they would fall thru the hole with the slightest bit of pressure. Is the
hole suppose to be 3/8, that's what mine are.

Also when I installed a new clutch cable mine seamed to be too long, the
set screw for the clutch almost threaded completely on the clutch cable
before it was adjusted correctly, This was with a new clutch, pressure
plate and throw out baring. I then found that a -71 clutch cable was 15
mm shorter than 72 - could mine have been a 71 clutch cable being built
in October of 71?

If this seams logical to you please give me your feed back, I need to
know so I can order the right clips and install a 71 clutch cable as
soon as I can.
Thanks.
Meredith
