Volks,

I recently &quot;fixed&quot; my car :-( and I am at a bit of a loss as to where to
go next (and *no*, it's not rip out the FI :)  Because the throttle body
was very dirty and the throttle was sticky, I removed and cleaed it.  Now
the bus idles very high, even with the throttle speed adjustment screw
turned all the way in.  Runs fine on the highway and is not heating, but
the idle is a bother and I'd like to cure it.  The only other time I have
had similar symptoms, the smal vacuum line to the decel valve had fallen
off.  Because it had been a past problem, and I had a spare (indeed, I had
just floped this decel valve in to test it before I &quot;fixed&quot; the car), I
flopped the 'new' decel vavleve back out, without any chgange in
symptoms.pe2
