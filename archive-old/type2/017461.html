&gt; I'm in the home stretch putting my engine together (after a major - for me -
&gt; disassembly and cleaning), and am putting the oil pump cover on.  When I took
&gt; it off, the nuts (all 4) had red plastic-like rings (?) that fit in a serrated
&gt; depression in the nut between the cover and the side of the nut in contact
&gt; with it.  I've searched the archives in vain looking for advice on how to seal
&gt; this and what the red stuff is that I found.  I dont think it was loctite
&gt; since they came off without much effort, but didn't seem to leak.  Also, does
&gt; anyone use gasket sealer on the pump cover gasket?  If so, what kind, and
&gt; exactly where?

Markus:
These nuts should be replaced with new ones, sold at better VW parts
houses every where. The plastic sealing stuff always breaks out. I think
Wurth products has them. Wurth are German products sold by territory
salesmen (like Snap-on) that travel the countryside calling on
independent repair shops.
