I have a full set on my '71.

They handle well, wear pretty well, and are very smooth and quiet.

Bad news is that they are not marked M+S, so they aren't legal for snow
use.

The tread is very smooth, which is a concern to some of the off-road folk,
but I find that running aggressive tread tires just helps me get stuck
faster.  These tires will spin in loose stuff without digging a hole.
