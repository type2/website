&gt; I've had a '70 bus for several years now, and whenever I do the valve 
&gt; adjustment, I follow the Muir procedure to the letter, however I have to 
&gt; turn the engine clockwise to get the right valves into adjustment 
&gt; position.  I've done it this way for years, and the bus runs great.

I am going to guess.. but I think your distributor is in 180 deg from 
&quot;stock&quot;  so when you think your setting 1.. your actually setting 3 .. and 
when you think your setting 2, your actually doing 4  ... when you think 
your setting 3 your actually setting 1 ... and finally.. when you think your 
setting 4.. your actually doing 2

something like that... set it Karls way and don't worry about all that other 
stuff.. way easier to do.

here is a message from a day when Terry was in a good mood.... I agree with 
him...

Don,
I saved this message from waaay back when--simply because the valve
adjustment question comes up frequently here--

Karl has the situation down pat--and no one has ever explained the job
so eloquently-- and easy to grasp--.

Follow these instructions and you'll get the job done right the first
time--and that will be the end of that task for now--

Hope you didn'y glue them rocker cover gaskets on--:&gt;)

Hasta,

Terry

Subject: Re: [T2] Stuck valves and promises

I keep seeing people trying to adjust valves using the distributor when
it is in the wrong position. Forget all that goofy crap way of doing it
by turning the engine backwards and trying to remember which ones to do.
The EASIEST way to do it is with a remote starter button and not
worrying where the distributor is. Takes longer to R + R the valve
covers then to adjust them!:

Remove both covers.

Connect a remote starter to the solenoid. Watch ANY pair of rockers.

Turn engine over with remote.

Just as the exhaust valve starts to open, STOP. Adjust the intake.

Turn engine, exhaust will open and close, intake will open and close.
Just as the intake closes, STOP.

Adjust the exhaust.

Go to the next cylinder.

As the exhaust just starts to move, adjust the intake. When the intake
just closes, adjust the exhaust. Real simple, real quick, real easy.

The valve you are adjusting will always be on the heel of the cam.

When you are done and before you put the covers back on, you can check
the position of the distributor.

Turn engine in direction of rotation and watch #3 valves. When the
exhaust opens and then just closes, STOP. At the instant the exhaust
closes the intake will start to open.
You want the valves to be at 'rocking' position, either way you move the
crank one valve will move. This is TDC to fire #1. Look at your crank
pulley. If you have a zero degree mark, it will be at zero.

Your rotor should be at the index mark also. [a high lift or long
duration or high overlap cam makes no difference, rocking valves is
rocking valves] If you are
NOT at TDC zero mark when the valves are rocking, your cam timing is
OFF.
