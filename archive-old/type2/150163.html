Subject: Re: [OVT] Type IV retarded-see pix please...

Hi John,

The oil cooler in your pic is the stock unit in the stock location,  
on the left side at rear of the engine. The bulge in the shroud where  
you *thought*the oil cooler should be is hollow, I suppose it's there  
for aerodynamics.


Happy trails,
