Subject: other uses for VW engines

Hello;  I've seen VW engines in Zamboni's, running small sawmills
(bushmills), and in numerous Volksplanes.  I once saw a VW powered street
sweeper.  The Zamboni's VW engine came to our local college to be rebuilt,
it had valve rotators on top of the valve springs, but other than that it
was a standard 1600 single port, oh yes it had a Chrysler alternator on it
too.  Oh for you southerners, a Zamboni is an ice dressing machine used at
artificial ice arenas.    Larry Carter
