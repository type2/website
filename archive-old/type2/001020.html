Daniel,
  Just another approach to think about.  I recently went to Advance Auto
here in Cary North Carolina, and the guy told me he can get calipers for my
'71 camper van in a day or two and they were about $42 apiece.  I think he
said the core charge for my old calipers was $37 apiece.  Don't know
anything about the quality or anything, just filed it away in my head for
future reference in case I needed calipers in a hurry/emergency situation.
