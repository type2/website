Nikki-
Check to see if you have snow tires or big 4X4 tires !

No?!  OK, then-
Grab the front wheel at the top and wiggle very hard
( or jack the front and hands at 6 and 12 0'clock ).
Any play indicates wheel bearings /adjustment / replacement.
( Hands at 3 and 9 will show play in steering components ).
Only one side fails at a time, but pull both wheels and
clean/ repack/ replace bearings ( get new wheel seals ).

As for the squirrely noise, check the engine fan for rodents:)
Have you oticed more power recently ? 8^)

&gt;What could cause my bus (1973 high-roof camper, as stock as possible) to sound
&gt;like I'm running snow tires or big 4x4 tires on the front at highway speeds?
&gt;  Kind of a growly whirring road noise.
&gt;
&gt;I thought CVs grumbled from the rear (this sounds like it's in the front), and
&gt;wheel bearings would make a squirrely noise.
