I don't know about the tranny fluid in the engine.. I'm sure we'll hear
from the other list members about that one..

in regards to the relay, it's the AFM (airflow meter) that you put a
stick or something in to force the flap open.  Take off the air filter,
and then stick a screwdriver or something long into the airflow meter
and push the flap open while the iginition is on.  the fuel pump should
start up...  The reason for this setup is to ensure that when the engine
is off (no airflow), the pump stops.. and vice versa..

&gt; Hi List,
&gt;         I'm having trouble starting with my new-to-me '78 FI bus.  I'm mechanically inclined (inclined, enclined...whatever ...I lie down when I work on cars), but have only worked on carburated VW bugs and old british cars.
&gt; 
&gt; I towed it home, having just rescued it from the side of a road, where it had sat for over a year with a 4-sale sign and gradually reducing price.   I wanted to lubricate the motor before starting it for the first time, and wasn't able to do anything where it was, so having paid a more than reasonable price for a relatively rust free bus, I have it at home and am ready to get to work.
&gt; 
&gt; I've pulled the plugs and lubricated the combustion chambers with about 15 cc of transmission fluid (suggested by a mechanic friend).  I turned it over without the plugs, then again with the plugs in place and the coil wire removed.  Everything seems to spin just fine. The plugs look right, and I didn't bother testing compression.
&gt; 
&gt; I've added a half tank of fresh gas (it was empty before), recharged the battery, and am now trying to get her going.  It will turn over, but won't catch.
&gt; 
&gt; The last owner didn't have any useful advice (he didn't seem to know the bus too well).  In the glove box was a not saying &quot;to start bus, put splinter of wood in relay, and listen for the fuel pump&quot;.  I think the relay in question is in on the left (driver's side) of the engine bay.  The cover is off  the this relay, and there appears to be two sides to it.  The right side had a bit of tooth pick forcing the contact.  Having the toothpick there doesn't seem to change anything.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, one of the wires attached to this relay (a red wire with a blue stripe) has a section which has been bared, and there is a red bit of wire (which appears to have been spliced in) that is bare at the end.  This additional wire is of a shape and length to suggest that it is intended to be touched to the bare portion of the red and blue wire.  When I touch the wires (with the ignition on - oh living dangerously!) i hear a buzzing sound from the right side of the engine compartment (its not a &quot;pucka-pucka-pucka&quot; sound like I assume a fuel pump would be - but nothing blows up or catches fire)
&gt; 
&gt; So how do I go about starting this bus....
&gt; 
&gt; What is this relay ?
&gt; 
&gt; What would having the toothpich there do ?
&gt; 
&gt; What do you think the the hot wire to the red and blue wire is for ?
&gt; 
&gt; How do I know if the fuel pump is working?
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice ?
&gt; 
&gt; later
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
