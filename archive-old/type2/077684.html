&gt; I like the solenoid idea. Just cycle it with the ignition or a separate

I like the idea of the spring loaded, solenoid tripped valve, it could
have a cable pull override if the solenoid failed,   they work on
diesel should work on gasoline.

&gt; 
&gt; How about a vacuum solenoid so there was no electricity involved? Vacuum 
&gt; holds it open, no vacuum, no open. Would require an electric something to 
&gt; open it at engine start for the fuel injected engines.
&gt; 
&gt; The other way would be to use the vacuum to close the valve in case of 
&gt; emergency. Hmmm. Bet this version would fail when it was needed the most.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been looking for said &quot;automatic&quot; valve that would open when the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ignition was turned on but have so far been unable to find it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm still looking.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Would be a great safety item in case of fire - would keep fuel from beeing
&gt; &gt; &gt; added to the fire and would require no effort to close - I'm certainly not
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to lean under my bus to turn a valve!!!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe a brass valve with a choke cable added to the lever...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Maybe a solenoid to actuate the handle on a ball valve?
