Subject: Re: [T2] Plumbing &amp; Fuel Pump for a late BN4 Gas Heater

that is somewhat what mine was doing also when I first got it. after I spent sometime on the phone with robert and adjusting the flame switch (i believe that is what it is called) it worked. mine would start and run but would never go into its full rpm mode. it should run for a min or two and then the fan should pick up rpm, mine wasn't doing that. I hope that helps a little.
