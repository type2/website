&gt;In the engine bay of my 1978 2-litre camper there is a fan above the
&gt;engine that has two outlets, it appears that they each go to one of the
&gt;heat exchangers...is this a booster fan??? I can't find any mention of
&gt;it in the handbook, but it it is there in all the pictures...and how
&gt;does it work, is there a seperate switch, or a thermo switch..
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be gratefully accepted....

This is the stock heater blower fan.  There should be hoses running from 
the fan down to air ducts that protrude up through the tin.  Looking 
under the engine you should see that these metal air ducts connect to 
the heat exchangers.  The fan blows fresh air down into the heat 
exchangers to be heated.  The fan is turned on when you turn the heat on 
all the way.  There is a ground connection that is made at the lever on 
the dashboard when you pull it all the way down.  This activates a relay 
which turns the fan on.  The fan should only come on with the ignition 
on in a '78.  In earlier 2.0L models, the fan would only come on with 
engine running and alternator charging.  I think they changed it around 
'77.
