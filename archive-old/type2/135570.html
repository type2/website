Subject: KYB GasAJust Performance (was: OG Sachs shocks?)

I just wanted to post about the KYB's I just put on. Particularly
after the discussion of the proper shock to use on our busses and
Richard's finding a source for the sweet Koni's...

The butt of my bus was mushy and wallowing. Pretty typical for a 30
year old butt! I wanted a really stiff rear suspension since that's
where the weight is. So I ordered the KYB Gas A Justs from BD. They've
been setting on my back patio for months waiting for me to get a
&quot;roundtoit&quot;.

After installing them today I went for a drive to pick up some new
valve cover gaskets. About 8 miles each way. I took surface streets
there and the freeway back to get a feel for the new shocks.

All I can say is WOW! What an improvement! 

I haven't noticed an uncomfortably stiff ride from them. In fact, they
smooth out the bumps much better than the admittedly worn stock ones.
The ride feels much more like my Volvo than the Fiero now.

I also noticed signifigantly reduced wind steer on the freeway.
Passing a semi at 70mph barely nudged me, where before I used to get
tossed around like a grocery bag.

I did replace the steering damper, but I doubt that has much influence
on the windsteer effect.

I still need to replace the fronts, but haven't decided on the shocks.
I don't think the stiff KYB's are necessary up front, and would
probably screw up the balance of the suspension (unless the KYB's are
tuned properly for the bus... Any comments here?)

I was thinking the nicer oil filled ones from BD would be the way to
go up front. Though I may get cheap and try the $15 NAPA ones... heh
