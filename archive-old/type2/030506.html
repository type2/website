the best VW machine shop in St. Louis that i know of is Archway on
telegraph road.  they can do a pretty good job on most things
case/crank/rod related.  I wouldnt hesitate to use them.

My personal policy is that if i have a very good core, i'll take that to
them to get reworked rather than going on an exchange basis however. (this
is good policy IMHO for any machine work nowadays, i'd rather find a good
core than have them rework one i havent seen as my standards are higher
than average)

Also, i am unsure of how they do type 4 heads.  It has been generally
accepted on the list that re-doing the seats on a type4 is obligatory to
avoid having dropped seats in the future.  The only companies i know of
that do a great job on this are mark stephens in tehachapi and AVP in
boston. (anyone else have a suggestion???)

also, we have a VW bus club in St. Louis.  We meet the third sunday of
every month at 6:00 pm at trailhead brewery in St. Charles, please feel
free to show up as we always welcome new people.  with a paid membership
($5/year) you get an ID card good for a discount at archway :)

Finally, we are having a campout the 19'th through the 21'st at cuiver
river state park called the Missouri Bus Fallout (yep i picked a name.)
This camput is less than an hour north-west of saint louis. p-mail me for
directions if you are interested.

ta for now,

Steve
