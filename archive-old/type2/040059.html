1) Muir is good for getting that initial &quot;I *can* do this myself&quot; warm
fuzzy feeling. 
2) Then read Bentley for the low-down (you *do* have a Bentley, don't
you?). 
3) Then come to The List when it goes horribly, horribly wrong (j/k). 

Of course, I left out step 2.5, which most people -- including myself,
sorry! -- forget in the midst of their panic: 

2.5) Check The Esteemed Library.

&gt; Is Muir in the wrong on this one?  I know much of
&gt; what he says is well out of date but I want a second opinion.
