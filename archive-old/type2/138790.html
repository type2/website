Subject: Re: [T2] Push Rod Seals

Try these. Viton seems to seal the best and last the longest.

&gt; This list has been around so long I feel like I am always asking a repeat 
&gt; question.  Can someone tell me their experience with pushrod seals.  In 
&gt; the library article about replacing them it is identified as two 
&gt; kinds..... Volks, and others.  I don't expect them to last forever, but I 
&gt; don't want to have to change them in a year.  Which brand is the best?
