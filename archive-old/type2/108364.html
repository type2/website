Subject: Which Thermostat do I want??

Hi all:

Having just determined that the thermostat for my Type4 engine has bit the
dust after only 3 years and being unwilling to shell out another $50+ for a
thermostat I thought I might make the switch to a TypeI thermostat.  Only,
I'm not sure which thermostat I need.

I thought the Type4 engine had a thermostat that opened at about 80c, but
the only Type1 thermostat I'm seeing opens at around 65c.  Wasn't there a
higher temp thermostat for these engines?  Anybody know what its part number
is?

TIA.
