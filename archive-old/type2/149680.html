Subject: Re: [T2] New Mr Heater portable buddy says NO inside use.

&gt;The Portable Buddy uses an Oxygen Depletion System (ODS) which is a safety
&gt;device used to light the heater as well as shut it off if Oxygen levels 
&gt;drop to

I've had mine switch off on me a few times, probably because I had it in a 
corner.  But even so, I would never use it overnight. A couple I knew of 
died in their tent using a conventional propane heater. Some other friends

camper with only a small window cracked. Scary thing was that their CO 
detector went off during the night and it didn't even wake them up. Yikes!
