Subject: Re: [T2] engine out and apart,Hmmmm

I'm back,

    I got a big'o trans. jack from like the 40's or 50's. It just required to 
raise the body 27&quot;.  Thanks for the info 'bout the dig. plug.

Unfortunately, I was just cleaning the carbon off the heads to get a better 
look.
Both heads are cracked!!! :-/

This is getting real ugly. At least the hyd. lifters don't look bad, and they 
aren't mushroomed.

More to come....
