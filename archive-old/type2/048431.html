Subject: [T2] NC VDubbers Photo Story

Hey Guys,
  I'm doing a photo story on VW Bus Drivers/Owners/Fanatics for my
Photojournalism class.  I'm looking for local people who wouldn't mind me
getting some shots of them working/washing/etc. their bus or bus-stuff.  If
anyone is interested or has any ideas, please let me know.  I'd also like to
see if we can get a bus group together, maybe somewhere in the triangle, for
dinner or something.  If there's any interest in this, please let me know
and I'll look into getting a bus-get-together scheduled.
Thanks,
Dallas
