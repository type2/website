Subject: Notes from the Annapolis Boat Show

A friend of mine works in boating equipment supply.  I went over to the
show to visit with him a bit and do a bit of a walkabout at the show.
Looking about, I saw the following of possible interest to bus owners:

Portabote - www.porta-bote_dot_com

Worlds ugliest web site, but an interesting concept.  It is a boat made of
polypropylene sheets that folds to a 24&quot;x4&quot;x8'6&quot; package weighing ~45
pounds  With a couple hooks and bungee cords, it could be strapped to the
side of a bus behind the driver's door and would not interfere with the
Westy poptop.

Handcraft Mattress Company - http://www.boatbeds_dot_com/

Makes custom size and shape mattresses for boats and RVs.  These pups are
*not* cheap, but they are *very* comfortable. They incorporate a hing in
the matress that allows it to be folded like an adventurwagen mattress.
I am considering one for my next long trip.  And of course, once you have
the mattress you will need sheets for it...

Quality Custom Linens - http://www.qualitycustomlinens_dot_com/

They can make you fitted sheets that will fit your bed, no matter what
shape.  I do intend to get at least one set, as the Z-bed in mine takes no
known size of fitted sheet and you can't tuck a flat sheet into air at the
front.
