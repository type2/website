&gt;I have e-mailed the writer of the piece in hopes that she can help us locate
&gt;Kathleen Gray. We'll see.

Kathleen and David live in various spots that they can park in near my
neighborhood. (Outer Richmond District, San Francisco) I have spoken to them on
occasion as I have with the nearly 40 Bay-window
owners/restorers/hobbiests/lovers in the area. I had no idea that they lived in
the van, and just assumed that they traveled far and wide like many of the
people in my neck of the woods.

I will try and hunt them down this evening, they aren't too hard to find. I'll
post results later.

Since this is my first message, and I am officially delurking, quick info listed
here (apologies to the list manager):
Peter
'70 VW campmobile
Purchased from family members, I am now the third owner.
Just finished first leg of restoration, paint and body are awesome, interior is
a rolling shell.
Body by Laveres (www.vwrestorations_dot_com)
Engine by John's (no website, but phone and address will be given at request)
TLC by yours truly, patience by girlfriend.

Many thanks to those who have helped me without ever knowing.

-P
