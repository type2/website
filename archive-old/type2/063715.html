Subject: Illegal searches

Back in 77/78, I was stationed in Ft Richie MD, in a rather unique unit. 
We would head out to various forts and install electronic equipment 
(Telephone exchanges, battery racks, comm gear, etc). We would travel to 
site on local reassignment, instead of orders, so our travel was 
controlled by our local command (as opposed to having orders cut from 
above).

On base we had the normal facilities, including a moderately well 
stocked auto repair area, where we could work on our cars. One day I 
came in to tinker, and here was a 61 van, ass in the air, parts 
scattered all around, with a happy E6 ripping the tranny apart. I could 
tell he was thoughoughly enjoying himself, because, despite a liberal 
smearing of 16 year old grease, he couldn't quite keep the grin off his 
face. As I pitched in to help, he related stories of his times in 
Germany, where he set up a shop with a local. (Later I found him to be 
the most knowledgable person I've ever met. He knew more about German 
autos than the guys who built them.)

Over a couple weekends, we got the rig cleaned up mechanically, and it 
ran better than new, despite having almost 200K on the clock. The body 
was sound, but it had been bought, new, by an old beatnick, turned 
hippy. The back end was covered with bumper stickers of every imaginable 
sort, and it had been to more places than Carter has little pills. With 
the use of a propane torch and putty knife... and later a grinder, we 
the stickers scraped off, the rust patched, and a fresh coat of rattle 
can primer/paint applied (Ritchie didn't have paint facilities, and he 
was headed out on the road Tuesday... which just left enough time to get 
the vehicle inspected and licensed... it was carrying Ohio plates)... no 
time for fancy paint, or to even remove the cabinettes the former owner 
had installed.

Any way, you can see the work we went through (mostly Bill, but I had 
about 40 hours into it as well). 

About a 2 months later, I ran into him at our telephone exchange. He was 
assigned to helping us get ready for an IG inspection, and the exchange 
was in SORRY condition (hey, they say mechanics have the worse cars... 
same holds true for 'phone exchanges).

I asked him about his van. It seems it made the trip just fine, with a 
few &quot;minor&quot; breakdowns, but was not being held by the local authorities. 
When he reached the base, they put him up in temporary quarters, in the 
quasi-military area of fort (Civilian and military could come &amp; go w/o 
checkpoints, and it was under dual authority). One night his team 
members woke him up because there was a lot of activity centered around 
his van. He looked out the motel window, and here were about a dozen cop 
cars, lights flashing, and a K9 unit... with military, State, and local 
cops gleefully ripping the interior out of his van. He could see some 
cop with a pry bar in the back, prying everything loose... and another 
with a big knife cutting the front seats apart... and dogs sniffing 
around everwhere (dog: &quot;hey boss, I think you should cut these tires 
open... they smell like someone peed on them.&quot;)

Discretion being the better part of valor, he slipped out the back way, 
and got himself lost. He didn't do drugs, but this didn't look good. As 
he put it, &quot;When Charlie has you outnumbered, find a big hole and pull 
the ground over you.&quot; After a sleepless night, he phone back &quot;home&quot;, and 
explained the problem to Sulley (our NCO). Sulley told him to get back 
home, and they'd deal with the situation in a civilized manner... and 
don't trust the locals (this was in a time of &quot;cooperation&quot; between 
military and civilian authorities... which meant you could count on 
being thrown to the wolves.)

Once back on Ritchie, the story was sorted out. The van was a &quot;hippie 
van, and we know all 'bout them hippies&quot;... which caused the locals to 
run the tags. He still had the original plates on the van, with a 
temporary sticker in the window. When they ran the plates, they found 
the original owner had slipped out of a couple towns in the middle of 
the night. All the authorities were called, and the dogs reported the 
van didn't smell right. A couple roaches, looking like they were left 
over from Woodstock (the paper crumbled when they were picked up), was 
found somewhere in the back of the van.

The locals wanted to pull Bill back in for &quot;questioning&quot;, but our 
commander wouldn't hear of it. They did a full investigation, especially 
since he had carried a controlled substance over state lines. When I 
last saw him, 6 months later, he still couldn't get the van back 
(evidence). A friend stopped in to look at it, but they wouldn't let him 
in the impound yard (held him for a couple hours, questioning him about 
his association). He saw the van parked in the yard, with weeds growing 
up around it, one of the windows open, and all the debris of destruction 
thrown in the back. The front bumper was bent, and the front end damaged 
(probably during towing it in).

He checked through a lawyer about getting the van returned, and found 
that he'd have to come in and claim it. Though they weren't following up 
on charges, they could reopen them. He was checking on a 
power-of-attorney, and having some brave soul recover the van.
