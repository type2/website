Subject: Re: [T2] re:dumb CDI question

To further clarify: a pertronix or compufire are JUST A SET OF POINTS as far
as the CDI is concerned. If you have a compufire/pertronix, you do NOT have
a magnetic trigger ignition.

You do have to ensure that you connect the pertronix/compufire red to 12V
(since a CDI hits the coil with 400V), and the black wire becomes your
&quot;trigger&quot; wire.
