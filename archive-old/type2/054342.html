&gt; Subject: When to inject
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I got a question that's been buggin the hell outta me on my 76fi.  What
&gt; &gt; I am trying to figure out is how the computer knows which cylinder is
&gt; &gt; going to fire and then know to open that cylinder's injector.  I know
&gt; &gt; that it's getting it's timing from the points, but the points don't tell
&gt; &gt; it which cylinder is firing, just when.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, do all the injectors open on every cycle of the points opening and
&gt; &gt; closing or is there actually some way that the computer is able to know
&gt; &gt; which cylinder is going to fire a particular time, therefore opening
&gt; &gt; that respective injector.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks!
&gt; &gt; Mike
