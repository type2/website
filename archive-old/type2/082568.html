Subject: [T2] Acid wash primer/sealers 


&gt; In speaking with the gentleman who is going to 
be eventually painting
&gt; Possum this spring he recommended that I sand 
the bus down to bare metal
&gt; and then apply an acid wash primer prior to 
spraying a high build primer.
&gt; He said that this stuff is usually clear and will help 
prevent rust from
&gt; recurring. Can anyone recommend such a 
product? I am imagining that this is
&gt; essentially a sealer to be followed by a suitable 
high build primer such as
&gt; &quot;fill-and-sand&quot;.

Sikkens Washprimer CR is the clear stuff (clear on 
the bus, looks like urine in the can) then apply 
Sikkens Autosurfacer 940HS over it. Sikkens says 
to apply one medium coat of CR to the vehicle and 
not to shoot by sight (like you would with a colored 
product) because you will screw it up if you try 
eyeballing this.

They also have a waterbase primer; damned if I can 
remember what it's called but it's kinda tannish. Let 
me look when I get home if you'd like the name of it.
