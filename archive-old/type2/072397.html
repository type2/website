Also, where did you get the cover from, been looking for a while for something cheaper than $99 from go westy?


&gt;Any decent marine supply should have these fittings in stock, in a choice of
&gt;brass/bronze or stainless steel.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Has anyone found stainless steel replacement for the luggage tie
&gt;downs on the surrond the luggage rack? I have a really cool vinyl
&gt;cover that appears to be made from the same material as the side tent
&gt;floor. The cover has leather straps that slip into the tie downs. I
&gt;would like to use this but I do not trust the rusty nasty tie downs.  &lt;&lt;
