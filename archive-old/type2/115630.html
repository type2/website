Subject: Re: [T2] making valve cover gaskets stick to valve covers

&gt; so what is the best glue, sealant, tooth paste, tar, chewing gum, or
&gt; whatever it is you use that will make them stick and keep my valve
&gt; covers from leaking oil.  and if possible be specific about the product
&gt; used.

Hylomar.

George Lyle made me a convert out of me. I carefully cleaned both valve
covers and used 00 steel wool to clean the head sealing surface. I applied a
thin smear of Hylomar to the entire sealing edge of the valve cover but
applied the head side dry so the Hylomar is only between the gasket and the
valve cover.

No more leaks. The last time I overfilled my oil which usually results in a
leak due to crankcase pressure, the oil came out of the sump plate where the
temp sensor was located. Previously it came out of the valve covers. Hylomar
works for me. Thanks George.

$3.50 and you only use a small amount so the tube will last you many years.
