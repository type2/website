Subject: Re: [T2] Dashboard attachment screws

Wayne asked:


 I checked out my dashboard after reading the post about removing the top of the dashboard and noticed that on
my bus a number of different screw were used to attach the dash to the bus.  Can someone let me know what the
correct screws for this task for both the sides (2 on each side) and the
ones near the windshield.  Along with the screw thread, I would appreciate knowing length, the head type (hex
or Phillips or .) and what washers, if any, are to be used.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 4 for the ends are phillips head machine screws. M6 x 15
part number N 14 140 1

The 6 across the front edge are phillips head metric sheet metal screws,
4,2 x 13  part number 311 867 167
flat washer 5,3 x 15 x1,6  part number  N 011 665 3
speed nut ST4,2 x 17 x 11,3 part number  N 015 422 2

In this pic,  http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t206500.gif
the end screws are #8. Earlier buses used 3 per end, so they used the lock washers #9. Late buses that used 2
on each end used metal plates so no washers.

The screws etc. along the front edge are 3, 4, 5.
The cap, #6, was used only from the beginning of 68 thru 69 up to vin 2X9 204329
