&gt;In the mean time, I dropped in on the local VW shop, just to get
&gt;acquainted. I told him what had happened. He told me that any time you
&gt;take the intake manifold off, you should have it machined. 

That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  Check the surface with a
straight-edge and if it is straight and smooth, put it back on as is.  

If I had machined my intake manifolds every time I removed them, there
would have been nothing left by about 1994.
