Subject: RE: nasty gas leak

If you have a gas leak on the left side of your engine compartment
check the vapor condensor line. That is the metal tube that runs up into the
vent area. Down just before it takes the turn to go up into the vent area
there is a break in the line that has a rubber fuel line splice. Check the
rubber splice,,,,it is probably leaking after you fill-er-up.
   Oh ya, Kate is in Portland Volks, not Seattle.

Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me. What a long strange trip it's been!
