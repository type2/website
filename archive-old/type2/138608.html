Subject: Loss of Power at Altitude

Just wait till you try going across the highest continous auto road located 
in and thru Rocky Mt National Park. The top is I think around 12,500 or so. 
Allitude does very bad things to the power output. Talk to Joe at Busted 
Bus. He will be glad to give you the skinney on what to do.  Tell him Cree 
sent ya ( for whats that worth ). He is a very nice young man, that Joe is. 
For a chimechanga (Mexican dish ) , he will do anything. Cree
