Subject: Rebuilt 2000cc Engines

I notice that Tiico has some (8) rebuilt engines offered on *-bay.
No Core and the price is about that of a pair of new heads and a gasket
set.
Might be worth investigating for some of you guys. If they have the
correct picture thay look like the CV series engines for 80-83 Air Cooled
Vanagons (not sure when they changed the oil breather).
Don't reply to me unless you want my rebuilt for $1800.00. 
Stan Wilder
