You may have a bad pilot bearing.  This bearing supports the end of the
input shaft away from the trans.  If it is bad it might keep the input shaft
spinning all the time, making it difficult to engage any gears.  Try
cranking the engine witn the trans in 1st and the clutch depressed.  If the
car wants to move, you have found your problem.
