Subject: I don't want to say goodbye.....

I was wondering if anyone can help. Just moved back to London from Turkey in my trusty 1974 Westfalia VW bus. Lots of optimism while doing my budgets means it's times for me to part with the bus but I have got no idea what to charge for it. I wanted to take it along to a garage or trader to see ehat price they thought I should ask for it or perhaps to see if they're interested. Does anyone have any suggestions of places in or near London I could take it to get a valuation or offer?


Thanks Ziad
