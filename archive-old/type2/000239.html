hi everybody,
I have an automatic bus which has been converted to a weber
carb. The bus ides fine but when you try to give it gas it stalls. It
appears that the accelerator pump isn't doing anything. Can you
purchase rebuild kits for these carbs. Its just a single carb not dual
carbs. Its on a 73 1800 type 4 engine. Also where is somewhere i
can get some more information on thses. I would appreciated any
advice others can give on this conversion. Will the stock vacum
dist do fine or will i need to purchase a different kind? Any tuning
insights?

Thanks
Phil Burton

Phil,
this is an 'easy' one, as I just went through this on my 73 with a 1700
stock engine...I installed a new single Weber 'kit' and found the 'stalling'
you refered too...apparently the Weber set-up gives you too much vacuum for
the stock vacuum dist...my cure was to install a '009' centfrigual advance
dist and keep the vacuum dist for a spare...with the 009 dist, my guru told
me to time it by hooking up the timing light and rev up the engine to about
2500 rpm or so and look at the full advance on your degree scale on the
engine...the 009 dist has about 28-32 deg's full advance...I set mine to 30
deg's and it runs great...this combination (single weber/009 dist) hasn't
worked for everyone if you look back at the archives, but mine runs OK,
however I think I'm getting fewer MPG than the dual stock carb's - but
without the carb synch headaches...good luck.
