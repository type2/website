Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] Dealer Microfiche machine value?

A film scanner with backlight should be able to read it at high resolution,
then you'd have to apply zoom to read it. With higher end stuf, this should
be possible. I think AGFA and MICROTEK have film scanners with backlights
for about 400 range.

I wonder if the fiche's could be read on a scanner at all.

I would love to see someone at the old vw documents preservation site take a
look at the possibility of doing that....be nice to try and
preserve those things for posterity.

Maybe if the museum would take theirs and get them on cd or something we
could get our birthday papers from them a lot easier.

Cheers, dave
