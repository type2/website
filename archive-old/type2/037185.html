Subject: Purchase advice needed

Hi. I'm looking at buying a '68 VW bus for my wife, and am looking for some
advice. I did try searching the archives and did some surfing first, but did
not find the answers to my questions, so here goes.

First off, the bus I'm going to look at is a 1968 -- that's a Type 2,
correct? It has a raised roof -- not a popup, but a permanently raised roof.
Is this classified as a camper? And if so, are there any problems specific
to that model that I should look for? I looked through photo galleries on
more than a couple different web sites, and didn't see any others that
looked like this one, which led me to wonder if this was a factory option,
or some aftermarket conversion. I'd be interested in any information,
pictures, or stories that you might have pertaining to the specific model. 

I know that it doesn't run, although I have no idea what the problem is
until I go look at it. If it's very simple, I'll fix the existing engine,
although if it's a very complicated fix,  I'm thinking that I might try to
pull the existing engine and replace it with one from a wrecked '83 Rabbit
diesel with a good drivetrain. Does anyone know if this is possible -- am I
insane to consider it? I'm a pretty fair shadetree mechanic; however, my
expertise is primarily in Land Rovers. I've never considered tackling a VW
before.

Your help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
