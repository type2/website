&gt;I've looked through the archives and read a little about this, but I'm not
&gt;happy with nay explanation there.  My '79 2.0 runs great, compression are all
&gt;125-135 except cyl. 1 which is under 100.  When I drive on the flat land, bus
&gt;is happy.

&gt;When I go up hills, my engine likes to push oil out of the dipstick tube!  Is
&gt;this normal?  What can be causing this?  It sure messes up nice clean heater
&gt;boxes when the oil catches in the fan and gets thrown right in there!

Excess crankcase pressure is most likely causing this.  It is due to excess
blowby (combustion gasses escaping past the rings into the crankcase - a
little is normal) which is caused by leaky compression rings.  Taken
together with the low compression you have in one cylinder, I'd say you
have bad rings in cylinder #1.  You can verify this with a wet compression
test.
