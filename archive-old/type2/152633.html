Subject: Power loss update.

I wrote a few weeks ago about power loss in my 1977 Riviera.  It has 
the 2.1 liter engine and its top speed was 30 up hills and 45 on flat 
straight roads.  After I had a new muffler installed, I got back a bit 
of power but it was still not where it was before I had a non-vw shop ( 
a long story on why I went there) install a new clutch.  The other 
night I checked all the electrical connections and found that the 
primary coil wire was barely in place, and that a secondary wire was 
frayed and needed to have the connector replaced.
So I went through and checked all the connections and made sure that 
they were clean, and pushed in place.

When I restarted, there was a total difference in power.  Now I can 
easily go up hills at 55, and can cruise on straight flat roads at 
65-70 mph.

There is still an intermittent power loss at high rpms that I can going 
to trace this weekend, but at least I can go on the freeway again, and 
the kids in their hopped up toyotas and hondas don't give me that &quot;get 
the piece of junk off the road old man&quot; look anymore.

Since the power loss is just intermittent, I feel that it is still an 
electrical problem.  i'm going to check all the connections again, just 
in case I missed something, and I'm going to replace the coil.  I have 
a feeling that the coil may be ready to go.

If you have any other tips on what you'd check, feel free to email me.
