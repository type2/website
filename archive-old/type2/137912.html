&gt; Most people don't seal the edges where pieces of tin come together. I
 wonder whether that's a false economy. The later buses with pancake
 engines have much more complicated (and less effective) systems of tin
 and seals than do the early uprights.

I count nearly the same number of tin pieces between the two. The
pancake engine has one more piece at the rear because the rear plate
is split into two where it is one piece one the upright. But both have
the same number of side widgets and bottom plates by my count. I find
the pancake tin more effective. At least type 4 motors always measure
lower temps on club run rest stops when checked with the Snap On IR
sensor.
