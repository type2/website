&gt; the torque converter area is dry. In fact, the entire transmission is
&gt; dry everywhere except for the filler tube side, from the piston cover
&gt; down to the pan. I can't really figure out where else it could be
&gt; coming from, because I don't think the ATF could leak from the pan seal
&gt; upwards. I also do not have any kind of diagram of the transmission
&gt; other than the tiny drawing of it in my manual.

BTW it is the same tranny on the early vanagons.  well it could
conceviebly leak there just have never seen it myself....there is a pretty
good set of drawings in the VW shop manual (orange book)
