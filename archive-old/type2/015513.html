.........a piece of a ring land. This is what I'm thinking:

Yeah, that's good thinking, Jim. Know that any mechanism that has hunks of
metal floating about needs teardown budget addressed. Sure sign of failure
somewhere, but you can drive till it goes ca-chunk as others have
suggested. Then you'll have no core value and a tow bill in the red column
plus how much inconvienience??? If you just idle around the 'hood', stay
close to home, maybe not a big whoop for a few more days/weeks/months use.  

But you hit the nail on the head. Good thinking. This is a common failure
mode when people put a new set of rings on old pistons and rehoned
cylinders. The new rings grip much more and really pound those worn lands
into submission.

The ring lands are stressed twice every revolution. The gaps widen over
time from wear. They wear beyond tolerance and begin to take a beating.
They crack and break along with the rings, and holes in pistons allow
pieces of rings to fall into the crankcase. If not overstressed, they darn
well can last 100k, if they were assembled properly and are quality parts
and are maintained reasonably. Can you say, in spec???

Check the heads and plan on rebuilding them as well if valve guide wear is
evident, another sign of excess stress at 50k miles from
lube/temp/maintenance problems. If the cam lobes are worn as well at 50k it
confirms a lube problem.

I suspect this short life failure would be rooted in a problem with
inadequate lubrication, like 10/30 oil in a temperate climate, or just poor
intervals.  Overheating incidents can initiate these wear problems cause
excess temp is a lube problem much over 220°.  Timing advanced a few
degrees from spec over a few thousand miles can cause premature wear of
metal parts from higher stress. Add a vacuum leak that allows lean running
for a long time before it gets bad enough you have to fix it. Result:
running 30° hotter than specs allow=short life=hell for the dollars/mile
equation. That's even if there are no holes in the tin to add a few more
degrees.

Wear rates can be built in from the get-go by non spec assembly and will
give short life even when prudently maintained spec or better. 

Know also there are a whole lot a people who never got 50k out of a T-II
motor, certainly not if it was Californicated by GEX, etal.

We all get to conduct our own experiments how we want as long as we're
willing to pay the cost. Keep notes, and let us know your results, so we
all might learn something for real.
