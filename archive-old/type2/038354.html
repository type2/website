Subject: muffler noise

Greetings,

OK here is the run down on what  is going on with my 77 2L FI bus.

1. All new ignition system, coil, plugs, 009, and wires. Timing and dwell
are dead on.
2. New muffler which is a four tip.
3. Exhaust leak on left manifold repaired.
4. Replaced right side pushrod seals.

Before 2-4 were done I had no back fire what so ever. Once I got him back I
was getting some small back fires. Two days ago I took it in for a
compression test 1 _at_ 110, 2 _at_ 112, 3 _at_ 104 and 4 _at_ 112, all seems good here.
I also had them check the lifters, I've been told hydraulic and solid for a
77. Turns out they are solid, lifters looked fine so we did a valve job.
One, two and four were lose and three was tight, ohhh he sounds much better
now.

So I am still plagued with some back fire, I am now being told that the type
of muffler (four tip chrome) could be the cause of the back fire. Can any
one else confirm this? it seems to fit with what work has been done and the
lack of back fire prior to the new muffler. If it is the muffler any
suggestions one what type to get? I could live with a two tip chrome....

Well I hope this makes sense.
