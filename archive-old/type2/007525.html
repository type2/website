&gt;Anyone out there with any experince shipping such an item?  I'm
thinking refrigerator box, but wanted to check the list to see if
anyone had done something this foolish before.  I'd hate to see a
&lt;

George (&amp; all)

        Such an item wouldnt be subject to dents or squashing.  If it were
me, I would drop by my FLAPS and see about &quot;borrowing&quot; some shrink wrap. 
This stuff is like heavy duty &quot;Saran Wrap&quot;and they use it to wrap up
pallets of rebuildable starter, battery and alternator cores.  I am sure
there are places you can buy it straight out, but seeing as how we are into
what we are into, we all probably have a pretty good relationship with our
FLAPS guys.

        I would wrap the bench until it doesnt look likely something could
poke thru it and damage the material of the seat during shipping.

        Regarding shipping an object of such large size, I was very
impressed with the shipping abilities/conveniences of airlines companies. 
I just backed up my pickup into there warehouse dock and some guys unloaded
me, weighed me in and processed everything...even on Sunday.  I think it
was with Delta or something like that.  I checked with trucking companies
and UPS but they seemed that either I was too large for one or too
insignificant to the other.   The airlines guys didnt care....they will
ship just about anything.
