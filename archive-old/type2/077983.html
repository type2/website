Subject: Re: [T2] Heating Question

Air flows the the area of least pressure -- basically just like water.

The heater blower will fill up the rear duct first and then it will back up 
and spill over in the front duct work. It takes about 1 second for this to 
happen.

There is a good chance that the center flapper box has a broken cable. Did 
you check it for free movement?

Anyone know who supplies a replacement cable for a '78 Westy for the 
flapper box under the front seats that divides air flow from back to front?

My bus came with a rag stuffed in the rear heater outlet. I'd make sure 
that the center flapper is set right manually so you don't reduce airflow 
to the front with the back portion shut off. I think that is what is wrong 
with my bus. That project is scheduled to happen about 10 minutes after I 
get the bus back on the road...

&gt;Got a chance go through the heating system on my '72 today and got
&gt;everything sealed up tight and ready for the cold New Hampshire winter.  I
&gt;noticed that the amount of flow to the cab section is significantly less
&gt;than the flow to the vents under the rear seat.  All paths to the front are
&gt;tight and solid, but there is still a huge difference in temperature and
&gt;airflow.  The controls on the rear vents do not completely stop the heat
&gt;flow regardless of adjustment, and this heat is basically being wasted, as
&gt;it is just trapped under the seat box.  I am thinking of sealing these rear
&gt;vents completely with a metal cap and a bit of epoxy putty (permanent, but
&gt;not undoable).  Before I do this, I wanted to check to be sure that this
&gt;would in fact send all the air to the front passenger compartment, and not
&gt;just trap it in limbo somewhere.  Anybody ever done this before, is it worth
&gt;the effort?  I definitely need some list wisdom on this one....
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt;Thanks in advance,
