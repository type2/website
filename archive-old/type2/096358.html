&gt; OK, OK... I think I have it..
&gt; How about, &quot;Volks-Motorwerks&quot;?
&gt; Picture a circle, transected from top to bottom with a long &quot;V&quot;, then the
&gt; outer &quot;legs&quot; of a letter &quot;M&quot; coming straight down from the top, but maybe a
&gt; little bit to the inside, so that it doesn't just look like a big letter
&gt; &quot;M&quot;? Can we do something with this one? It would look enough like the VW
&gt; logo to p!$$ them off, but not enough legally for them to do anything about.

someone would have to trademark it,
