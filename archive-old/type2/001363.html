Subject: Before And After Pics

I just added 2 new pictures of my '77 to my web page, one taken just =
last night. The &quot;before&quot; picture is not really accurate, as it was taken =
at EveryBus 2001, and I had already done a considerable amount of work =
to it already. Somehow I have managed to delete all the pictures I took =
the day I bought it. To recap, I bought this Westy in November of 2000, =
it had been sitting for two years due to a rusted front axle. The =
seller, who lived in a condo, was using it as a storage shed. He had =
neither the smarts nor the $$ to fix the axle, and if not for the condo =
association forcing him to get rid of it, it would probably still be =
sitting there. I had to deal with some of his &quot;cheap fix&quot; ideas, like =
bathtub caulk used as a pop top seal and a vinyl shower curtain glued =
and screwed to the roof as a headliner! The condo association =
unknowingly saved this poor Westies life. I have two things left to do: =
reinstall the windshield and repaint and reinstall the front bumper, =
which I hope to do this weekend, then I am DONE! Well, OK, I'll never =
really be done,as there are more things I want to do to it, but this =
completes all the major items for now. Now if I could only find the time =
to take it camping...      Jeff
