I happened onto a website that was related to high performance sports
cars.
They suggest that you use one gauge for both cylinder head temp and oil
temp by simply installing a toggle switch that changes sender output from
oil temp to cylinder head temp (340 degrees). Could also be water temp
and oil temp if the gage reads high enough for oil temp (300 degrees)
It keeps your dash un cluttered and saves space in tight dash board
situations.
I thought it worth mentioning since gauge mounting in Vanagons have
limited space for additional gauges.
