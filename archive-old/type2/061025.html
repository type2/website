Subject: Friday project: Deface a repugnant ad

Hey, Type2 sisters and brothers,

In the December issue of _Outside_, on pp. 24-25, is an advertisement for 
a Lex*s sport ute that is both offensive and ironic. It shows a line of 
suburban houses each with a tank in its driveway. Not a metaphorical tank 
-- a real, Army-issue, tank. All except for the one driveway in which 
there is a Lex*s. Get it? It's not especially subtle. The ad copy reads: 
&quot;As rugged as any other S*V on the block. It just rides a whole lot 
smoother.&quot;

Now, if that image and message bother you, here's something to do. Park 
your Westy in the same orientation as the Lex*s in this ad. Pop your top. 
Take a picture of it. Get the roll processed. Get your local Kinko's or 
what have you to make a color copy of the picture at just the right size. 
Cut out the ad and paste it on a piece of poster board. Cut out your 
Westy and paste it over the Lex*s. Replace the ad copy with &quot;Pop a top 
for Peace.&quot; Hang this on your office door or wherever.

Passive resistance. It has to start somewhere.
