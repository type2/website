&gt; On the way home from the parts store, the kids spotted a vanagon camper
&gt; essentially identical to my 81 just around the corner. With the olympics
&gt; there are a lot of folks visiting Atlanta. We did a slow roll by this one and
&gt; it had B.C. plates (but no V_at_L sticker). 
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, I at first thought that it had only two outlets on the left
&gt; side but then spotted the electrical outlet below, close to the rocker. I
&gt; recall from the busboys catalog I think that there were some different specs
&gt; on the canadian model wiring. Do Canadian regs require the lower placement of
&gt; the electrical outlets?
