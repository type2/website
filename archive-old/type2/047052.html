Or so I thought.

Bus Depot agreed to correct a situation with which I was unsatisfied. I
appreciate that however

I called BD this morning to see when the replacement order that I had placed
on 10.2.00 was shipped. Not only had it not been shipped but there was no
record of it at all. I was assured that the order would ship today but that
it what I was told last week. I asked to have them call me back with a UPS
tracking # and they said NO! They could not tell me if the item was in stock
or where it would come from if not in stock. I asked if I could be called
back to confirm that the order was in fact processed and shipped today and
they said NO! I asked if I could give them my UPS account # so I could have
the order shipped next day air and billed to my account(which by the way was
goind to be $2.00 cheaper then what I was going to pay BD for UPS ground)
and they said NO!.
