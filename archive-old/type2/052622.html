Subject: [T2] Valvoline MaxLife Challenge - Not SPAM

The following was found in the 3/10/01 Orlando Sentinal. Sounds like the
perfect contest for a Vanagon or Bus owner.

Valvoline MaxLife wants to know how much you love your car!

If your car's odometer reads more than 75,000 miles, then enter the MaxLife
Car Lover's Challenge! All you have to do is fill out the online entry form
and submit a 500-word essay about why you love your car, and you may be
chosen to take the challenge.

If you're chosen, we'll challenge you to live in your car for 75,000 minutes
(52 days), traveling up to 10,000 miles on a cross-country excursion. If you
complete the task, $75,000 is yours and Valvoline will donate $1 per mile to
Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.

Entries are due by March 23, 2001.

Challenge runs from May 7-June 28, 2001.
