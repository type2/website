Subject: Stock Speaker from a 73

Anybody want the stock speaker from my 73? It's the center dash speaker. I 
pulled it out when working on the wiring underdash and decided if I put 
another one in there, it'll be a matched center channel.. ;)

I don't know if it works or not, but all it will cost you is shipping. There 
don't appear to be tears or other damage, but the adhesive holding the back 
cover on has decayed badly and the cover pops off easily.
