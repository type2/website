Subject: [T2] DMV woes....

Hey all,
   Wanted to take a Friday opportunity to share  a unique (to me) DMV thing.
   Went to the DMV to register my newly acquired 79 Westy.  Instead of 
getting regular car (or truck) plates- Ms. DMV hands me &quot;motorhome&quot; plates. I 
explain that this is not a class A land yacht- just a small VW bus.   
Besides, everyone I know with a Westy has regular car plates. 
   She tells me that because it can be used as a &quot;temporary dwelling&quot;, it is 
now classified as a motorhome. 
     BTW- I didn't tell them that it was a westy, but apparently some PO must 
have titled it as a motorhome or something. This is the only way I figure 
they would have known. I don't know which plates PO had on it.
    This is a bummer for 2 reasons. First off, you surely know that motorhome 
plates are more expensive to get and maintain registration.  But secondly- 
these plates in WI here are QUARTERLY. That means that the plates I just got 
expire in March already!  Car plates are yearly, of course.
    I have two ways out of this. I can either get &quot;collector&quot; plates, which 
will cost more money, plus are more expensive for a &quot;motorhome&quot;, or, I can 
somehow convince them to let me use regular car plates. 
   Anyone else have to title their Westy as a camper? Or did I manage to find 
the one witty DMV worker here?
