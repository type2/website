Subject: Steering Gear Box Beeded ('65)

I need a good used or rebuilt steering gear box for my '65 Kombi.
Wolfgang is out of stock on rebuilts and won't have any for three weeks or
so. Anybody got one s/he is willing to part with? Can anyone point me to a
commercial source? Private e-mail response to mrndlmn_at_access.digex_dot_net
would be much appreciated.

TIA
Martin
