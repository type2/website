They must have been at some point. I went to your site to see about
ordering some and noticed the comments said that it was included in
the fuel line replacement kit.

When I had my injector off, I only saw one seal. Your site lists part #
311 133 261 for lower end of injector. What is 311 133 263 (upper end of
fuel injector?  I only saw one seal on my injectors!
