Subject: Exhaust Help Needed

Well, I finally had time to get under the bus with daylight left today.  I 
found a small hole in the pipe from the right (FIF) heat exchanger to the 
muffler.  I plugged it temporarily with duct tape to see if that was the only 
hole.

Unfortunately, I could still hear hissing while starting and running from 
somewhere on top of the heat exchanger.

My questions are as follows:

1.  Are the heat exchangers necessary? I live in Las Vegas, NV and don't need 
heat for inside the bus until at least next November/December.

2.  Would a &quot;leak&quot; inside the heat exchangers cause my bus to stall out after 
it has been running for about 20 minutes/20 miles?

3.  If it turns out the entire exhaust system is bad, can I do this myself 
with NO welding experience or should I trust it to my mechanic?



I have posted some pictures in case my explanation is not clear:

I appreciate any advice/help.
