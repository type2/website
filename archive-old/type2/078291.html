Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Runner Gaskets

Oh you're talking about the phenolic material - used as heat insulators as 
well as a gasket.

Probably a good thing on fuel injection engines for some reason. On carbed 
engines it keeps the carbs from overheating and boiling the fuel (vapor 
lock?).

&gt;I don't think this will work. These blocks (sorry I don't have the
&gt;part number on hand here, but I also bought them form BusBoys) are
&gt;about 7mm (just guessing, so no one quote me on that) thick. It is a
&gt;gasket as well as a spacer. You would have to pile up many layers of
&gt;gasket material to accomplish this. Oh, also it's a very solid piece
&gt;of material so it doesn't give much at all.
