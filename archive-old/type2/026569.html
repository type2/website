I was in Albuquerque, NM last week (and missed the bus get-together,
damnit).  In one of the junk yards out there I saw a loaf bus with the upper
portion of bug (from about 2 inches below the windows) welded to the top of
it.  Kinda interesting looking.  Would give a lot of extra headroom and
provide a GREAT observation area for passengers.  Anybody else ever seen
anything like this?
