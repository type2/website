Useful VW Type 2 tools are found at current Harbor Freight 1/2 price sale.

Item 00807-1BEB  3/8&quot;  0-80 ft lbs torque wrench  $8.49  (I use mine much 
more, now that I have it ???) 1/2 price.

Item 34214-3BEB Angle Finder $2.99 for setting correct angle at rear end.  
(Don't droop like me, or get your rear end lifted to the sky by a 
'professional'  because you were not courageous to set the torsion bars 
yourself !)

Item 02104-6BEB  Tarp, size 19' by 29' 4&quot; ft.  $12.99 Blue Poly (Ships at 
12.5 lbs weight; will hang way over a Westy.  Ask me how I know??  I 
measured twice, cut once, applied bandage, and measured again  &lt;a joke, 
OK?&gt;)  Smaller version at 00880-6BEB is 17' 2&quot; X 23' 4&quot; is only $9.99, and 
should allow air to flow under the type 2 to keep dry bottom.

Item 32250-5BEB  8&quot; bolt cutter  $2.99.  Cute.  Cuts 1/8&quot; bolts

1-800-428-2567; Canada and non-US people call 1-805-388-3000 (&quot;We ship 
anywhere in the world!&quot;)

JC Whitney has a 10% off sale, on everything.  &quot;Mention Code K208&quot;
