Subject: Propex Heaters are here!

I just got the call from the customs agent. I'll be picking
them up tomorrow after work, and UPSing them out Wednesday 
morning to listmembers who are not stopping by my place to pick them up.

Total customs duty, handling and fees on this end were $513, or
$27 per unit, plus whatever each individual UPS bill is, 
likely no more than $15. 

While I have not seen my credit card billing yet, and the foreign
exchange rate continued to deteriorate while the deal was pending, I
expect the charges from Propex (the unit plus freight) to be about $400
each. So the delivered price ought to be well under $450! 

All hail the power of the list(s).


Tom F.
