Message-ID: &lt;37212707.C81_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

If you were going on a long trip (like to Alaska from southern
California) in your bus, your '71 bus:

1.  What would you do to prepare the bus for the trip?

And 

2.  What tools would you bring along, minimum?  to start we would bring
an extra pulley, fan belt, oil, good portable tool kit, replacement
points/condenser and/or extra electric ignition. . .

And

3.  What reasonably small and easily carried parts (engine parts,
running gear parts) would you bring along?


Just waiting for your consensus. . . 


Thanks,

Lauria Watts
