&gt; &lt;snip&gt; here's some real-world observations for your consideration
&gt; and amusement.  These observations are from the same Westy with a fresh
&gt; bone-stock fuel injected 914 2.0 motor (rated at 95 HP) mated to a 5 speed
&gt; Porsche 901 transmission:
&gt;
&gt; 1. 4th gear has a very similar final drive ratio to the original
&gt; transmission's 4th gear.
&gt; 2. 5th gear drops the RPM by about 800.
&gt; 3. In 85 degree weather, cruising 75 MPH on the highway in 4th (4200 RPM),
&gt; my oil temps get up to about 240.
&gt; 4. Same condition as above, but in 5th gear (3400 RPM), my oil temps drop to
&gt; about 210.
&gt; 5. With no head wind and on flat ground, I can shift into 5th at 70 MPH and
&gt; continue to accellerate up to 95 mph, but after that, the accelleration gets
&gt; harder and is is definitely affected by hills and head winds.
&gt; 6. In a 20 mph head wind (read wind resistance equal to speed+20mph), I have
&gt; trouble maintaining 75 mph in 5th and must constantly use 4th gear on even
&gt; the slightest inclines to keep my speed above 70 mph.
&gt; 7. Buses were not designed to be driven much above 75 mph and catching a
&gt; side wind gust at 85+ mph is not much fun.
&gt; 8. Blowing past Suburbans on I-10 at 95 mph is very gratifying, but re-read
&gt; observation #7.

Hi all;
   Mike dropped by my place yesterday to get a new fan for his single cab and
let me take a turn at the wheel of his SuperBus. WOW! Power curves/aerodynamics
be d*mned, that critter goes like the proverbial bat out of h*ll...well, for a
Bus anyhow. It was very interesting to look down at the speedo and see the
needle moving rather smartly toward 90 mph after getting to 80 pretty darn
quick...had to lift off at that point, didn't want to mess up Mike's bus (it was
windy here yesterday and the side wind factor was coming into play) and wasn't
willing to try to explain to the local constables why a VW Bus was rocketing
down &quot;their&quot; roads.

Heck of a ride, Mike.
