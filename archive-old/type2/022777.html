Subject: '71 bus for sale
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi all!
    Due to a back injury, I am forced to sell my '71 bus. This is a 7 
passenger bus w/walk thru and 3/4 seat in middle and full seat in rear. Bus 
has about 1000 mi. since rebuild. Rebuild includes: new 
piston/cylinders,heads,Blue coil, 009, 34 Pict. carb, plugs and wires, single 
quiet pack w/chrome muffler, degree pulley. Also has new windshield and seal, 
new rubber on both front doors and slider. Wheels have been repainted back to 
vw silver and tires have about 80% rubber. Interior is in great shape with 
just the usual wear and tear. Body is fairly straight with some rust at 
rockers just in front of rear wheels and some minor rust on floors in cab 
area. Color is white over blue. There are quite a few primer spots, as I was 
in the process of doing some minor body work.
    This bus runs and drives great. It has been my daily driver since about 
March of this year.
    I am asking $1500 but will consider all reasonable offers. I do not have 
any pictures online, but will try to get some up ASAP.
    If interested please e-mail me at sjsh4601_at_cs_dot_com
    
    TIA 
    Steve
