Subject: trip from illinois to washington state, upcoming

hello all,
  i am a very new vanagon owner (a 1980 campmobile), just about one month,
and a less-than-novice mechanic. i've been working on making what repairs
seem necessary and am planning on driving it out west to washington state in
about a week. i am nervous about it having major problems and would like
advice on what seems really necessary.
  here's what i know:

* the muffler is weak, old, rusty. the tailpipe fell off and i got a new one
welded on, but not a new muffler.
* there are major oil leak/burn problems. it is in the shop today to
determine the level of these problems and what needs done.
* the engine isn't compressing fully in all cylinders. (80-120-120-120).
* tires. maybe i need new tires to be able to get over the mountains and
almost definite snow?

beyond the known things, any other suggestions/worries? as for the known
things, any advice? do i need a new muffler? do i need new tires? should i
get a new engine, or just try and fix the leaks in the current one and wait
it out? (the engine has only 85,000 miles on it, which is part of my
hesitation to get a new one).

any and all advice would be appreciated.

thank you.
