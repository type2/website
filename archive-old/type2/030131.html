&gt; is for.

Craig,

This is the wire that supplies power to your reverse lights. As Rob says,
it plugs into your coil on the side *opposite* the wire to the condensor.
It runs from the coil, thru the fuse, and down to a switch on the left
front of the transmission, in the nose cone.  A second wire then runs back
to the light bulbs.  If you have no reverse lights after you plug it in to
the coil, check htat there is 12v at the fuse, then at both sides of the
switch (with the trans in reverse and the key on, of course :-)
