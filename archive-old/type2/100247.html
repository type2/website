Subject: Re: [T2] FLAPS - Trak Auto

&gt;Since Trak went into bankruptcy, they no longer exist and they
&gt;are no longer around to honor their warrantees.  If it's a house brand,
&gt;you may be out of luck.  OTOH, if it is a national brand, then the
&gt;manufacturer, operating thru Advance, should honor the manufacturer's
&gt;warrantee.
&gt;

Apparently this is a store brand for Trak Auto.

Nice to see it was 'buy American', though.  The Battery I recently bought 
from Sears had the 'made in Mixico' warning sticker on it!!
