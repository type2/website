Subject: Riviera Rescue

You may remember a couple weeks ago when I posted a message about a bus that I though was a Riviera. Listees yon and hither confirmed that it was in fact a Riviera. So I did the deal by phone, agreeing to exchange cold hard cash for a bus of unknown providence. I only knew that my pictures showed it as straight and the engine was sitting in pieces in the cargo bay. 

Today I made the journey and brought the '72 Riviera back from Little Rock (to Memphis). I was happy to find a VERY low rust bus with undercoating and good vinyl top. One of the screens has been patched a time or two and needs it again, but the vinyl appears to be untorn.

Much to my surprise, the interior appears to be complete! ...though odiferous of rodentia. There is a cooler/water contraption, a seat behind the driver, a table, a pull-out bed, a closet, and a bunk up top, with pull-out pieces. The pull-out bed has lost a little foam and fabric to the mice, but otherwise it's in good shape. No tent tucked away, but I did find the bus manual, a dealer's directory, and a Sears toolkit.

The original Riviera cooler/water tank monstrosity, constructed of high-quality early '70's partical board has decided to start falling apart. I intend to take pictures of it and then offer it up to the list, hopefully finding a home with a Riviera owner who hopes to go stock but is missing this item. It will need complete reconstruction, but I think the essential hardware is all intact and in good condition. Personally, I have no desire to make a show bus out of this; I'm aiming for a functional camper and to that end have secured a Dometic Fridge/Cooker from another listee. I will install that in the camper, even if it doesn't match the decor perfectly.

The last time this bus was on the road, I believe, was 1984, as evidenced by the inspection sticker. The bus was inspected at 117,000+ miles and parked at 118,000+ miles. I can probably estimate it's park date within a month once I really get to investigating.

As for the thread about picking spouse or bus...my spouse has granted a one-day parking-for-cleaning in her minivan's normal spot. Wonder if she'd kick the mom-mobile to the curb for me, if she had to choose?

Tomorrow I will tackle mouse droppings and engine parts to the best of my ability and then stash the bus at Ken's for a little while. Thanks Ken! Thanks Erin!

Take care! Joe
