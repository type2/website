Subject: RE: [T2] Brake diagnostic

Thanks all for your inputs. I went for the adjustment of the rear brakes. 
Now I understand why some people on the list seem attracted by the 
self-adjusting vanagon drums...

Turns out that one of the stars on the left side is blocked. Weird it is on 
the side that still had the rubber cap on the hole to check pad wear... I 
used the only turning star to get the shoe(s ?) gently rubbing on that side, 
both stars on the right side. Is it insufficient to adjust with only one 
screw ? Does it mean that only one shoe works ? Left side was no issue 
adjusting.

Brake pedal travels less now, the braking is as good as it was previously, 
after the &quot;pump one time to pressurize&quot;. Overall feel is much better, 
however the rear right wheel always locks when the brakes are applied hard. 
The van drives straight when braking.

Status is :
left rear has an adjusting star blocked and the rubber cap in place.
right rear does not have the rubber cap and locks when braking hard.

Next I'll try to bleed the system.

Quick look at the todo list / Hey Santa, here are some ideas !

buy the bentley for cheap on ebus
finish brakes
fix oil pressure light
adjust valves (learn before)
change heater cables
install 3-point retractable seatbelts
fix multiple engine oil leaks
put synthetic gearbox oil
ship my 009 to Mars / install a distributor with vacuum advance / pertronix 
ignition / new ignition cables
renew shocks - shoot i missed the special order from busdepot ...
install something to know if engine is overheating (will require lots of 
reading in order to make an educated choice...)
reset torsion bars for stock body height on the back
get tires with proper load rating (not passenger car like i have now-brr 
scary)
hang spare tire in the front

I was really not expecting to get so much into bussing ! This list is 
addictive !
