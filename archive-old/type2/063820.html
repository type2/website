Subject: Re: list stickers

&gt;  Then here's the other problem. the last batch of t-shirts I did, about 30
&gt;people e-mailed that they would buy one. However, when the orders came in, I
&gt;only sold 15, which didn't even cover my costs. I would hate to get stuck with
&gt;a box of stickers that I really can't afford.
&gt;Anyway, I am not altogether opposed to the idea, just a bit wary this time...
&gt;If enough people promise, swear, etc, that they will actually buy stickers, not
&gt;lie to me and get my hopes up, I might think about it. As in, this time, if I
&gt;receive e-mail from you, I will keep it, and keep replying to you until I get
&gt;your order. (You can't escape!!!)

Since Hair Palmer has generously consented to print new stickers (Didn't
you, huh, Richard?) but has not generously consented to get burned with the
cost thereof I would like to suggest a solution.  Don't print them until
you get the money in hand.  Here's the plan.

You offer sticker shares at $5, or something that makes numerical sense.
If you sell enough shares for a quantity price break then the purchaser of
each share gets 7 stickers.  Not enough orders then the share is worth 5
stickers.  You close the share selling at some fixed date, like maybe
Christmas.  After that point anyone who wants a sticker must buy it from
someone who ordered a share and therefore has stickers to sell.

The problem with this plan is that it is a lot of bookkeeping for somebody.
Sticker share buyers could maybe fill out a little form to help with the
bookkeeping.  Like

name:    _________________________ | shares purchased:_____________
street:  _________________________ |        money collected:_________
City/state________________________ |        stamp enclosed? _________
                                   |  name again:____________________
Then maybe just tape the left half of the form to an envelope and mail the
stickers using the enclosed stamp.  Processing even a hundred of these
could be a pain, but we're all VW van owners.  What's a little discomfort
for all this community and history?
