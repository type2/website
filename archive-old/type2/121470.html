Subject: Re: [T2] brake fluid filler to reservoir hose

Hiya Brian,

I had to replace this hose a while back.  When I went to look for a 
replacement I got shrugs mostly.  &quot;Sorry, no longer available.&quot;  I finally wound up 
going to a hydraulics shop and finding a hose to fit.  By the way, it was such a 
good fit that I was able to dispense with those miserable little rubber 
sleeves on the reservoir and filler container.
