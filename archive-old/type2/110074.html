Greetings from a new lister

I am in the process of putting back together a FI 2 litre for a '78 bus which 
my oldest son had dismantled about three years ago, and then just abandoned 
in the garage.  This was due to a broken crank - that's my boy!!

I'm ready to install it, but I am mostly clueless as to where the various 
vacuum hoses (and wires) connect.  I guess the labels he attached when 
disconnecting must have fallen off ;)

Anyway, can anyone suggest a website for pics or step by step destructions.  
I have Muir, Bentley and Haynes.

Thanks.

Steve
