Subject: Air Shock/Tortion bar advice

I'm heading down to Baja for several months and will be off-road a lot,
and I'm looking for rear ground clearance advice and alternatives. My
ASI conversion has a couple inches of rear end sag, and to make matters
worse the shop that did the last rebuild (done by PO) added a Berg-type
1.5 qt sump, which also cost a couple inches of ground clearance and
seems pretty exposed down there, although the extra oil does seem to
help with engine cooling.

Bottom line is that I need to gain a minimum of three inches of
clearance back there. I'm wondering how much can be gained by tortion
bar adjustment, and how that adjustment relates to spring
compression/travel. Any advice/knowledge would be appreciated. 

Alternatively, I just read an old post from a guy who had already
installed coil-over shocks, then changed to Napa coil-over air
adjustable shocks (Napa part MA758, which is still available).  He
mentioned some required spacers, but did not elaborate. Anyone have
experience with these shocks and the spacer situation?
Thanks,
