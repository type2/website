&gt; Bill, perhaps you could try those camping saws that lool like a cable

&gt; the saw and pull it back and forth (this takes two people cooperating).
&gt; Also, those carborundum impregnated cables designed for hacksaws to cut
&gt; metal- beat the flat ends into a &quot;V&quot; to make them smaller in diameter.
&gt; You perhaps could try snaking in a stranded cable that will fit; then
&gt; check one end into a drill and &quot;fray&quot; out the other end so the frays
&gt; work on the rust as you pull out the cable while it's turning?

I'm leery of any method that can cut metal.  I've had good luck with
removing debris from tubes with a length of gas welding rod.  Hammer the
end flat and give it a slight bend.  chuck it  into a drill and slowly
feed it into the offending tube, lubing with light oil.  As the tube
clears, bend the flattened end more to clear a bigger hole.  the idea is
that the flattened end scrapes the inside of the tube as it rotates.

Key point is not to force it.  Having a bit of steel lodged in the tube is
worse than what you have now.
