Subject: FI and Distributors questions 76 vs 79 

Volks: I had a engine fire in my 76 Type II. Anyone know
      if the distributor from a 79 Type II is compatible.
     The vacuum advance unit looks quite different.
   
   Second question regarding fuel injection, and points.
  I've heard a lot about the second set of points that the FI computer
 uses for timing. My distributor doesn't seem to have these, or any 
wires to hook them up. The only terminal has wires that go to the coil, and into 
a wiring harness that I haven't traced yet, but I suspect goes to 
the FI Control unit. Note the 76, and 79 distributors do have a little oval hole 
in the body below the main points plate, which is plugged by a little metal 
plate. What is the story here?
If the FI uses the ignition points, how does it know which injector
to fire?

Thanks
