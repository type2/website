&gt; While I was wiring up the ignition bypass, I inadvertently bumped something
&gt; that caused the instrument lights to go out.  I'm guessing a wire, but
&gt; wondered if there was a common boo-boo that would cause this condition to
&gt; happen.

It's a small gray and red wire that starts at the headlight switch with the
small connector (earlier switches had a larger male connector). Then it
walks each bulb which is grounded to the back of the instrument panel and I
can't remember where it ends up exactly after the hazard switch.

Check the ground to the back and the headlight switch. I hate that kind of
work because you need to disconnect the battery for safety yet you need to
test in there with it live.
