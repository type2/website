Subject: Re: [T2] External oil cooler

Before you spend the extra $$ for an external oil cooler, I would
highly suggest you check out the entire cooling system. I also have a
79 &amp; it ran hot for the first few months I had it. I pulled the motor
to replace seals /etc &amp; found that 75% of the oil cooler was plugged
as well as the fins on the jugs pretty darn blocked as well. After
cleaning it my temps went down &amp; by the reading of my oil temp gage it
heats up to under 240 or so at most. VW wouldn't have put out an
engine that needed an extra oil cooler. Check what you have first,
before putting a band-aid on. Good luck.

&gt; It has been a long time since I have posted and I have only had time for
&gt; minimal browsing. I asked about this last summer..... and then the bus a 79
&gt; has been in seldom use for most of the winter. As someone suggested last
&gt; summer, I checked my oil temp gauge today with some boiling water and a meat
&gt; thermometer in the water. If  you do this remember to ground the sensor (I
&gt; thought I might have damaged it untill I remembered!). Any way the guage
&gt; seemed fairly accurate - by the time I got every thing coordinated the meat
&gt; therm. read 190 and the temp gauge about 187 or so. What worries me then is
&gt; driving temps last summer around 250 and sometimes higher. This leads me to
&gt; the external cooler. Two main questions (1) do I need to put in a different
&gt; oil pump to do this, (2) where can I look at kits - who sells them (actually
&gt; I have seen one at busboys) TIA
