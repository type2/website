Subject: Re: [T2] Need Better Freeway Gears

P-II works fine on SOCAL freeways, obviously in the
slower lanes. Usually cruise at 65, but slowed down a
bit when gas was &gt; $3.

With the FI 2.0 it will go close to 80 if need be, but
I normally don't run it firewalled.

The biggest issue seems to lane changes on interchange
ramps...the car behind me will see a bus, and try to
jump out around, blocking me from making the lane
change to get on or off that freeway.  The best
solution to this has been to anticipate the way their
little minds work, and beat them to the punch, so I do
those kind of lane changes as early as legally
possible.

I'm not too worried about getting rear-ended in a
large orange bus with a white pop-top...
