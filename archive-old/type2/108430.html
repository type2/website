Subject: Re: Japanese site

You would be surprised to find out that there are some of these Subaru
Sambars here in the US.  They were imported here from 1968-1970.  They were
air cooled, 2 stroke, oil injected, 2 cylinder, 360 cc, producing about 26
hp.

I have two sambar vans and two sambar trucks.  I am hoping that between all
the parts I have enough to restore one van and one truck. The van will be
painted like my 78 bus and I will call the bus &quot;me&quot; and the sambar &quot;mini
me&quot;.

Here is a link to the subaru 360 club in the US:

Kindest Regards,

&gt; Oh yeah!  This Babelfish translation sounds like the instruction
&gt; manuals to old Japanese model cars I used to try to put together...

&gt; Very informative.  And:

&gt; And my favorite:
&gt; &quot;It is just one example of the customer whom you  conclude at this
&gt; corporation.
&gt; The full order which pursues your originality is possible.&quot;
