Subject: Re: [T2] AFM adjustment of spring tension-how?

&gt; Tom said:
&gt;
&gt; &gt;idle mixture control. And no, the AFM flap/resistance circuit is *not*
&gt; &gt;uninvolved when the engine is idling. The minute you start the engine
&gt; &gt;the air vane moves from its &quot;resting&quot; position to a position
&gt; &gt;corresponding to the the engine's air demand, be this &quot;idle&quot;
&gt; &gt;or &quot;wide open throttle.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;Well although this is correct for the idling discussion involved it
&gt;should be noted the WOT statement is not correct for L-jet's
&gt;with a WOT switch which as we all know includes variably 2L
&gt;buses and most Vanagons. In those systems WOT mixture is
&gt;a preset item totally independent of the AFM.
&gt;
&gt;Well, since I said the *air vane* moves according to engine demand,
&gt;including WOT, I can't see how the statement can be declared &quot;incorrect.&quot;
&gt;Are you saying that when the throttle is fully open the air vane *doesn't*
&gt;move from its position of &quot;something less than wide open throttle?&quot;

It is incorrect because it is.  I mean exactly what I said at WOT in an L-jet system with the WOT switch the air vane position doesn't do jack.  The duration of the injection pulses at WOT is according to a FIXED constant, the position of the AFM doesn't matter one iota, injection is controlled under those circumstances as base injection (a function of engine rpm) and the preset WOT constant, with the other regular modifiers, engine temp etc.  And FWIW at WOT under load (about the only time you are at WOT) the AFM will most likely be wide open as well, excepting following instantaneous drastic reductions in load or perhaps if you were trying some flat out downhill WOT runs.

&gt;And to tell the truth I'm not sure how much idle mixture is
&gt;involved in the AFM either, I've never tinkered with that
&gt;end of the spectrum but it seems to me that I recall reading
&gt;idle mixture is a preset as well, perhaps RPM based as VW
&gt;L-jet never had an idle switch.
&gt;
&gt;from fiddling with something they knew nothing about. Having adjusted the
&gt;idle mixture with the top of the AFM off I know that the air van moves in
&gt;response to these adjustments.


Sure it does my point is I don't know how much those movements on the bottom end matter or how much they are filtered out and injection duration is a function of rpm.  I don't know, I said I didn't know.


&gt;As to the whole resetting your AFM anyway my only
&gt;advice is be careful and don't make rash adjustments,
&gt;shouldn't take more than a few clicks to restore it to
&gt;stock operation which is too lean anyway

&gt;Why do you say that? The whole system is trying to keep the air/fuel ratio
&gt;right at the point that *all* the fuel delivered can be burned in the
&gt;available air.


Yeah with late 1960's technology.  The L-jet system on air cooled T4's was optimized in the heady days when they thought stoichiometric would be OK for an air cooled car.  It wasn't, in a relative sense they tend to run lean, this is stated in a few Bosch books, billions of VW&amp;P/Euro Car tech articles over the years, and I believe in the &quot;How to tune your Bosch FI&quot; manual as well.  It pays from a cooling perspective, a power perspective, and a longetivity perspective to have something slightly richer, particularly to garantee the the thing doesn't go lean somewhere in it's operating envelope where you didn't tune it which is entirely likely.  In a water cooled engine with infinite cooling capacity or on a system with O2 feedback, who cares, in a stressed to the cooling envelope 2.0 in a Vanagon, you'd better care.

YMMV
