Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch cable just broke... Need help

Mike,

Hmmm.... I am going to assume on the back as water would love to run 
down the bowden cable.

Since the same type of &quot;boot&quot; goes on the back heater heater cables.

If you could actually get to it...and assuming it fit, I can't see why you 
wouldn't want one on the front as well.  

Those cable tubes can probably use all the sealing they can get.

Cheers, dave
