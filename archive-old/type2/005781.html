TODD SAID:

how to get the inside handle/latch &quot;cup&quot; (where you open
&gt; the door from the inside) to come out.

Get a small slotted flathead and look close at the cup.  On one side is a
small hole on the edge where the screwdriver will fit.  You will need to pry
and this piece will pop right off.  There is a screw holding the door panel
behind it.

Peace Brother,
