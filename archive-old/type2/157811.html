Subject: Need Donations for Steve Dolan's engine

Folks,
   
  I rejoined the list briefly here after 4-5 years off, mostly because I'm on a mission.  That mission is to build a German parts only engine for Steve Dolan's '67 before I move to Alaska in July of this year and am too far away to conveniently deliver and install it.  Most of you may or should know Steve.  The Type 2 list continued to exist for a couple of years at least from both a financial and administration standpoint only because of him and his efforts.  Steve is probably the single most giving guy in the VW Bus world I've personally ever had the privilege of meeting.  As the list administrator he could be a real pain at times if he disagreed with you or if you were stupid, but the same can be said of us all.  Anyway Steve has also been having some health issues recently and has trouble even working on his '73 and '80 drivers, let alone getting much done on the '67.
   
       So a few years ago, pre wife, and now new child, I told him I'd build the engine for the '67 and I've been slowly collecting real German parts ever since to build an honest 1500 with all NOS German parts, which even against my advice (I wanted a counterweighted crank and a bit more modern induction at least) is what he wants.  At this time I have all the big bits, NOS German pistons and cylinders, cam, rods, and heads.  I'm looking for a few more bits, very reasonably priced or frankly donated.  I need a clean set of original single port tin, fan shroud with the slats, and fan, not looking for NOS on this, but real dry, clean, and rust free.   I will likely media blast and repaint though if clean enough I'd like an original shroud with the stamped numbers still on it.  Next a clean single port manifold, carb (is '67 a 28 PICT?), I have a couple of governors, don't need them.  Need a German NOS oil cooler, and ideally oil pump.  Would like a set of NOS German lifters.
  Need an NOS German fuel pump.  An appropriate dizzy and a generator in clean rebuilt shape wouldn't come amiss though I think he has the electrical bits.  Those are the parts that come to mind, though small bits like a real clean crank pulley, etc would also come in handy.
   
  Anyway like I said, anybody who ever met Steve knows what a great guy he is.  I've had the privilege of knowing him for about 10 years, and have helped him a fair bit with projects but have had him help me as free labor, or storage, or whatever far more, and I'm sure a lot of metro DC area list members have had the same.  If you've squirreled away a little NOS bit here or there you may never really use, and are feeling generous or at least reasonable, give me a yell.  If someone could forward this message to vintage and vanagon I'd appreciate that as well as I don't want to sign up just for the begging.
   
  Thanks,
   
  John Anderson
