I just got my dome type tent from    /eurocampers_dot_com/  tent is quite nice
and light weight.  It sets up easily and stands alone from the van so you
can drive into town leaving the tent up.  There is tunnel that hooks to the
rain gutter making a good seal when connected.  The only gripe is that it
doesn't have a bug screen installed. I guess I'll have to learn to sew and
put one in.  Maybe just use velcro
--

.....We planning to use it mostly for pic nic &amp; camping and we would like to
know where to buy a tent that fits fine on our new bus.

if you can share some info we will really happy to hear it !!!
thank you.
