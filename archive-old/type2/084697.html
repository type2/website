&gt;I've come to realize that most people are now almost
&gt;totally dependant on seeing that third light to
&gt;recognize that you're braking. I figure that

In the 70's studies were done and just such devises were offered. From 
memory, I recall the frequency of best utility to capture attention was 5 
to 7 flashes per second. I installed such a devise on my BMW R90S. I have 
no idea if such modulators are still available. Truly, this is a very good 
safety item. You get a whole higher order of magnitude better response from 
followers. Indeed, better recognition stats were obtain for daylight tests 
as opposed for night time.
