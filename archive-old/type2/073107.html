&gt;So, can any one top that?  I heard the Westy is good.  How modern is
&gt;that conversion?  The Xplorer must be old.  I don't know how old though.

The only conversion we've ever heard of on the list whose top opens from
the side is a Dormobile. Is the flexible part made of vinyl, and does it
have a scalloped appearance when open?

&gt;All the walls and seats are
&gt;covered in fine upholstery.

Finer than gold naugahyde??? Quit. We must see pictures! Can you send me scans?

How did this bus get to Japan anyway, do you know?
