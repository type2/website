Subject: Travelling again...

Hi Volks,

My employer is sending me off into the field again... are there any  
Bus Fanatics on the list from Abbotsford British Columbia??

Suggestions on what to see or do would be appreciated.... I am told  
there are LOTS of type2s still on the roads on the left coast.

Happy trails,
