&gt; I am still fighting the battle of the left rear window, the one with next to
&gt; the vent.  It seems like the seal is too big, but it fits around the glass,
&gt; and the seal minus glass fits into the opening, but the seal plus glass
&gt; won't go.  Have you come up with an answer yet?

BTDT. German seal, left it to the pro. Cost me $85 (can you say
OUCH!!!). But I stopped by and looked at it today (she's with the
mechanic getting other stuff done, too) and it looks BEE-YOO-TEE-FULL! I
can't wait to get the other side tinted, rust-treated, and replaced now.

BTW, it took one guy probably much less than an hour -- I paid for the
liability song-and-dance. I suspect I could've done it myself (with a
helper) if I'd given it a shot with the new seal. The German seal
definitely looked a bit leaner than the repro seal.

I've noticed that outside the junkyards there are usually small shops
that install window glass. I may use them as a backup next time as
opposed to a mainstream installer.

Live and learn.
