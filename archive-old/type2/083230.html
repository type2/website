Subject: 3 passenger front seating for Vanagon Westy

I have a line on the passenger bench from a '86 or '87 pannel 
van that uses a single seat for the driver and a two person 
front bench seat for the passengers. Unfortunatley the 
drivers seat is missinga, and the wrecker is reluctant to cut 
out the seating hardware so my questions are:

1) Can I use my regular Westy drivers seat with the pannel 
van 60% right side bench?

2) Should I just forget it if I can't get the seating 
hardware or will it pretty much bolt onto what is in place 
already in my westy?

3) will I have issues with the handbrake or shifter?

Thanks,
Chris
