 Hi there,

 
 I have to remove pistons and cylinders, decide whether to
   a) reuse them
&lt; I wouldn't do this unless really hurting for cash and just going to use the
bus for local trips &gt;

   b) put new rings on them and &quot;hone&quot; the cylinders.
        A local shade tree mechanic said the type 4 pistons and
        cylinders re-ring up real nice.  Bob in his &quot;jugs&quot; sermon says
        ring jobs on a VW never work?  Since most of his Sermons deal
        with type I engines, anyone have an opinion (Bob?) on how the
        type 4 engines fair, or should I just go for option c:
   c) buy new pistons and cylinders ($300.00)
 
&lt; Look in VW Trends at NOPI's ad or go to their internet site,,,  I don't
know what size P&amp;C's you need but the 1700cc's are  $169.

.  Maybe this will come back to bite me though...

&lt; Any of this could??    You are taking risks when you low buck it,,, if it
works you'll feel great,, if not, you'll remember... It's the cheapskate that
ends up spending the most!! &gt;
