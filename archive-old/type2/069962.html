Subject: Returned - 1. Brakes (fwd)

Hi-
I first posted this on vanagan list, only to find it changed:

I am back on this list after a year's absence.  I finally have my van and 
net access at the same place.  A few things have come up, and here is the 
first:

I did a tune up yesterday, and I wanted to adjust the rear drum brakes on 
my 76.  First, I noticed the rubber seals on the inside of the drum were 
missing.  These should be replaced, right?  Second, my adjusting stars 
would not rotate on the right wheel.  Are they rusted or gunked up?  Any 
advice on freeing them up?  Then I opened the drum up, and I still could 
not turn them.  But I noticed that my lower returning spring was broken, 
yet the brakes work OK.  Is this a hazard?  Am I going to die from faulty 
brakes?

Thanks in advance for any help.
More issues to come-

Jesse Reynolds
