&gt; Hi Im installing an aircooled_dot_net svda dizzys in my 1976 2.0 type four and

I don't believe it will.

&gt; In trying to  get the notch on the edge of the distributer to

which notch are you trying to align? the little &quot;line&quot; on the edge of
the top of the metal, or the notch the cap must fit in? They are most
likely different (at least on mine they were). Try this. Rotate engine
till you get to TDC of #1 cyl of the compression stroke. Then see if
you can rotate the distributor body around so that the rotor points
towards the small &quot;line&quot; case into the distributor body. If this fixes
it you will need to reindex your plug wires. No big deal, just start
at #1 and work around.
