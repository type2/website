&gt;Regarding idle mixture... Normally this is one using an exhaust gas 
&gt;analyzer.  A CDI is going to improve the burn in the cylinder (at 
&gt;least, that's the reason I'm considering it :-), and so is going to 
&gt;alter the exhaust gasses.  This renders the %CO spec somewhat useless.

You don't know how it's going to change...

&gt;Should I make sure the idle mixture is set correctly *before* I install 
&gt;the CDI, and revert to stock ignition whenever I adjust the idle 
&gt;mixture?

Setting it as as starting point is a good idea but you don't need to revert in order to reset the mixture later.

&gt;Is this going to result in running too lean?

Maybe.

&gt;Or, should I 
&gt;set idle mixture to the %CO spec with the CDI installed?  Or is this 
&gt;going to result in running too rich?

You have to do this afterward the CDI install, first for smog tests, second to dial in the ignition system to get the best mix of economy and power at WOT. You should also have a CHT gauge to give you ball park figures of the changes to head temps.
