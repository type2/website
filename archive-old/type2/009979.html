Well, coming back from a camping trip in the '77 Riviera I stopped for gas 
in Jackson, Ohio, turned left without looking first and WHAM. Front panel 
and driver's door are shot; passenger door won't close (I had to kick it 
open to get out); windshield's gone. The bus is still full of my camping 
gear, including one of those 10x20 canopies from Sam's Club, and my massage 
table.

It doesn't look as if the frame's bent or anything that serious.

My plan at the moment is to wait till Monday and rent a U-Haul, pull it back 
to Kansas City, and consider my next move. Pickings for VW mechanics/parts 
hereabouts appear slim, although I'm willing to be surprised.

Seeking any ideas, advice, sympathy and whatever else my esteemed listmates 
think appropriate. Preferably by 5pm this afternoon (Saturday) Eastern time, 
since that's when the library with the Internet computer closes.

Thanks everyone!

Best Regards,
Brian Baresch
Lawrence, Kansas (usually)
Jackson, Ohio (for the moment)
'77 Riviera (all bunged up)
