Subject: lock cylinder removal

I finally got a replacement lock cylinder for my front door handle, and 
the thing won't come out of the handle.  The other two I've removed came 
out easily once the screw and spring were moved.  This one is locked and 
I don't have the key.  Will they not release when they're locked?
