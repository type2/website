Thanks to all the replies, I backed off the shoes a bit and used a hammer to 
free up the drum. But once inside I was disappointed to find everything 
properly conected. I pulled the e-brake and it spread the shoes just like it 
is supposed to. The only thing I found was a nut buried in the shoe linning, 
popped it out and everything looks good on the drivers side. Could one side 
being broken and the other not broken allow the e-brake handle to come out 
all the way?
