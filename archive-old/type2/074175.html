Subject: 78FI on a 76 2liter

Is there any reason I can't run my 78 FI harness and computer on my 76
engine?  The 76 is running kinda funny so I want to swap out the harness
and computer and see if it runs any better.  I'm also going to be
putting all new hoses and other general maintenance stuff.

The only major differences that I've noticed between the two engines (78
and 76) are the distributor, lack of throttle switch on the 78, and
lifters(hydro/solid).  Are there any other differences?

If I swap the wiring, do I also need to swap the distributor?

Thanks,
Mike
