&gt; Finally read something on this site that made me angry! Even allowing

&gt; perceived timing by one degree (i.e. all the electrical delays in the
&gt; timing light leading to a delay in the flash), you would have to be

I have many thick physics books and I don't think that I'm going to cross
virtual swords with Stephen over this issue.

Hmmm, Stephen... physics expert... UK addy...  Shouldn't your address end
in &quot;_dot_cam.ac_dot_uk&quot;, and how exactly do you get that wheelchair into your
bus?...  :)
