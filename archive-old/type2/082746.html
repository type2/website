Subject: RE:[friday] Regarding &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; buses...

Hi all,
  I couldn't resist jumping in on this one.
My last bus, a 1970 Westy was not owned by a hippie. 
This poor bus was rescued out of a field near Clevland
OH and was so rusted on the underbody it was only a
matter of time before it was a gonner.  I paid $700
and drove it home to Toledo.  I put new tires on it
and spent $1300 to get it running in top shape. (at a
local mechanic)  I took care of Valve adjustments, oil
changes and lots of other maintaince.  I have been
called a hippie, been flashed the ole peace sign and
told cool stories by folks who no longer bear any
resablance to their hippie background.
  When the time came that the body could no longer
hold its own, I scrapped the bus. I am not proud of
doing so, but it is part of life.  The engine resides
in a 68 Westy that is totally hippie.  The PO has all
sorts of cool hippie stickers and did take good care
of this bus.  It did have a problem with engines
though and that is how I came to own it. (ok, my
boyfriend.  I gave it to him)  With a good engine this
bus has a new lease on life, with a new loving home.
  My latest bus, a 71 Westy, is also from a guy that
would be considered a hippie.  He took execelent care
of this bus and I am glad I bought it.  The buses are
polar oposites... currently there is only one sticker
on the 71, while the whole back end of the 68 is
covered.
  I love my dub, and miss the old green bus.  I don't
mind being called a hippie anymore... and I did buy a
few Dead cassettes just to make it look good. (I have
listened to them once.)
  Favorite Dead song:  I will get by.  I remember the
video on MTV back in the 80's.  Prefer to listen to
Alice's Resturant by Arlo Guthrie, and Linkin Park.
(come on, how hippie is Linkin Park?)  
  Just my take on buses.
-Dawn
PS- when driving home my 71 for the first time I got
the ole peace symbol flashed at me by a guy in a new
beetle and a guy in a f*rd aerostar.
