Subject: Re: [T2] Good news - Roof rack and Beetle stash

In a message dated 1/20/06 4:13:44 PM, honey_bus_at_hotmail_dot_com writes:


&gt; I have loaded in my '78 Westy what appears to be a stash of old Beetle
&gt; parts.  I need help on identifying a roof rack, and if this [probable]
&gt; Beetle roof rack would fit any Type 2 buses, like split or bay.
&gt;
&gt; The feet seem to be the width of the rain gutters, but I have a Westy, so
no
&gt; joys for me.  Any value on this for, say, a '67 split??  Or a bay station
&gt; wagon??
&gt;
   I bought a roof rack at a yard sale just for the feet that attach to a
rain
gutter (hard to find now that most cars don't have rain gutters anymore).
I made up an extension out of oak to raise the cross pieces so the rack
would clear the &quot;hump&quot; in my Bay's roof...Plenty o' sheetrock carried on
the rack since then... ;-)
