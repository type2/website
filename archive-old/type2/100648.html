Subject: RE: [T2] '72 Windshield Rubber?

bought locally here at Volks Cafe for about $25.  It appears to be very good
quality.

&gt; So, my '72 (Sally) has been &quot;away&quot; since December of last year for body
&gt; and paint, and now it seems completion is waiting on windshield rubber.

got mine from Bus Depot,
