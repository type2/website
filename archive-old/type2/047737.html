grab your latest copy of the Harbor Freight catalog.

check out the &quot;Central Hydraulics&quot; manual transmission jack (item
39178) pg 72 in the green covered Fall 2000 catalog

At $69 this is a reasonable quality tool for occasional use, and I
routinely remove and install both my 2L type 4 engine and automatic tranny
solo with the help of this tool (which I put a stabilizer bar across the
top, nice but not required)

and for those who don't know me, I am a 50+ year old veteran in a
wheelchair, if I can do it, anyone can.  sure it is easier when there is
help handy but it isn't necessary.  one of the better $69 I have spent for
my bus.

and no I don't work for Harbor Frieght,
            don't even buy that much from em
