Subject: Re: [T2] Oil temperature sender conversion?

Gerald,

You anticipated my next question(s):

A good location to mount the oil temp sender? and is the tee fitting a good 
idea?

Running a wire down to the sump plate seems even messier than the dipstick 
sender with its double wire.  I am considering installing a 2nd oil temp 
gage using the tee setup, leaving the dipstick gage in place and then see 
how much lower the tee sender reads.

     Planning to use the same location as your pressure sender? Not a good 
idea.
    While on your Type1 engine the location is close to the block using the 
Tee
     moves it out an inch or two and will show the tems a bit low. On a 
Type4
     one has to use &quot;relocation hose&quot; because of the tinwork and the temps 
shown
     would be WAY off.

     If you want to use a non-dipstick sender it should be mounted directly 
in
     the oil flow path. I THINK there are methods to mount the sender in one 
of
     your pressure relief plug ports for the Type1 or down on your sump 
plate.
     For the Type4 the taco plate is the best location.

     Hopefully others will chime in with suggestions for Type1 mounting, 
I've
     been digging for info on Type4 gauges lately and my Type1 info is 
lacking.

     Yes, the other senders can be used with the same gauge and wiring.

         Can a VDO oil temp gage with dipstick sender be converted to a 
non-dipstick
         sender using the same wiring? For example using a &quot;T&quot; fitting 
(VDO-240-850)
         to mount a VDO-323-423 sender.
