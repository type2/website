&gt; Well I dropped by Buggy World yesterday to arrange having Buster towed
&gt; in. The guy asked me what was wrong with it. I explained how the starter
&gt; went out and it was making a racket and the puttering sound it made
&gt; before that when it was sorta running and he tells me I sucked a valve,
&gt; mentioned something about the heads, showed me another buses engine he
&gt; was working on and tells me yours is the same as this one. Then he kills
&gt; me with &quot;it will be about $4,000 to fix it&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; I just thanked him and turned around and walked out. All that without
&gt; even looking at it. So what do I do now? I can't tow the bus all over
&gt; town, but unless I know for sure what's wrong I don't know if I can
&gt; afford to even have it fixed. If it's that much I'll just have to sell
&gt; him. The worst thing is, Buster is parked at my apartment building I
&gt; moved out of 2 weeks ago and I can't bring him to my new place so I
&gt; don't know what to do about it now.

First suggestion is to find another shop.

Second suggestion, though it
pains me to make it, is to have a male person deal with the shop, at least
initially.  I'm amazed and disgusted by how poorly women are treated in
some shops.

A blanket $4000 estimate is a pretty obvious attempt to rip
off someone that the mechanic figures doesn't know better.
