Subject: Re: [T2] Frozen Brakes!??

Justin,

If it has been wet there when you parked and it has been awhile, they may 
be slightly stuck to the drums.

Try at fairly serious tap on the drum/wheel area with a hammer...make sure 
you emergency brakes are off and wheels chocked first!

Sometimes the brake pad material likes to bond with the drum after being 
wet and drying off while they are pressed together from the emergency 
brake.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,

&gt; Last night I installed my new tail light assemblies (ref previous
&gt; post), so there was a fair amount
&gt; of running up to the cab and depressing the brake pedal to check
&gt; for lights.
&gt; 
&gt; Today, I needed to move the Bus from its spot in the garage so I
&gt; could access the attic... won't move!
&gt; I've seen sparing references to frozen brakes, but a search of
&gt; the archive only addressed cold weather
&gt; issues - and it certainly ain't cold here in GA!  Nonetheless, I
&gt; did some rocking F/B in 1st and Reverse=
&gt; no luck.  I didn't push it for fear of damaging things.  It seems
&gt; to be only in the back wheels.  My parking
&gt; brake seems fine as the handle engages and retracts normally.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the likely culprit here? What do I do about it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
