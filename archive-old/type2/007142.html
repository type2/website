Another lurker comes in out of the dark!!!

A friend with a shop has an old Porsche 914 that someone started a resto
on and gave up.  Motor has been rebuilt, rest of car including tranny is
there, but body is shot.  Has anyone ever tried to put one of these
powerplants in a bus (say, a 71)?  Will the motor fit the bus tranny, or
will the 914 tranny go in the bus?  Would it be worth the trouble?  Is
the moon really made of green cheese?  (Oh, that's another site, sorry).
Thanks-

-Pat
