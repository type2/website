Subject: Re: [T2] Bay windshield installation

John,

I have never heard of the second method.  Sounds crazy...as I can't 
imagine how it would work...how would you keep the seal in place while
you tried to put the glass in???

I have done it twice, but paid to have it done last weekend(chrome trim 
included).  Like the glass guy said last weekend...&quot;there are not too many 
glass guys still around that know how to put one of these in&quot;

Cheers, dave

&gt; When installing a windshield into a bus, is it best to 
first attach the rubber seal to the glass, THEN put the 
whole thing onto the bus using the string method. 
OR is it better to first attach the seal to body of 
the bus THEN use the string method to place the glass into the seal? I have read about it both ways.

&gt; Thanks!
