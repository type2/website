Subject: Re: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

Hi Michael,

There isn't a problem with the oil pressure. The gauge reads about 4-5 
bars of pressure (60-70 PSI) when then engine is cold, eventually 
dropping to about 1.5 bar during extended highway runs.  But it doesn't 
hardly leak at all when it's cold, even though the pressure is a lot 
higher.

Tonight I plan to set the valves and do a compression test and closely 
inspect the dipstick tube gasket for good measure.

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; I have this same oil leak all though not as bad (I probably go 
&gt;&gt; through an
&gt;&gt; extra quart per 1000 miles) but all the same symptoms/oil locations 
&gt;&gt; Gregg
&gt;&gt; mentioned.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So what else could/would cause this high crank case pressure 
&gt;&gt; thing??????
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have a question for both of you and the list. Could this have 
&gt; anything to do with the oil pressure relief valve? Have either of you 
&gt; checked it out? Or could this even be a possibility?
