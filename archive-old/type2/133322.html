&gt; &gt; The range of HP from the 1.7 to the 2.0 is 63 to 70 in the Type2's?
&gt; &gt; There's gotta be more to the 2.0 than that...
&gt;
&gt; My stock 2 litre, dual carbs puts out 82 BHP and bags of torque :-)
&gt; I did have the crank and rods balanced though...

but you are in the &quot;olde&quot; country where they measure HP differently.

is that 82BHP   DIN or SAE ??????
