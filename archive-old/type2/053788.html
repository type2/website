Subject: dual battary relay

Hi all,

     I have my first question on my 76 Westy.  In the engine compartment,
someone added a Ford style relay.  There are 2 large terminals &amp; 1 small
terminal.  There is a wire from each battery to one of the large terminals.
There is a wire form the small terminal that just ends.  It connects to
nothing.  Any ideas?  Thanks.  I wish I was ready to go to Westfalia Acres
this weekend.  I will be ready for the next event.
