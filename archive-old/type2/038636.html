Subject: fuel problem?

hi guys,
went to start my 76 FI kombi this morning and it ran for 5 seconds then cut
out sounding as though it was out of fuel
guage was low so i put in fuel and checked for free flowing fuel at the pump
inlet.
now it will occasionally start run for 5 and stop but generally not kick
over at all.
does anyone know whether they are prone to air locks after running out of
fuel?
or is my fuel pump likely to be on the way out?
any other suggestions?
jeff
