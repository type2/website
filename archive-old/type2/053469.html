NO, do NOT use vacuum hose. Use booster hose. Regular vacuum hose will
collapse!!!!

&gt; I accidently broke my brake booster valve while trying to remove the old
&gt; hose...I called my local Foreign Aide and they said they did not stock
&gt; them...Try a junk yard...
&gt; First of all, why the heavy duty hose?  I was trying to remove this hose
&gt; from the valve and it punctured a nice size hole in my finger.  Is it
&gt; mandatory that I replace this hose with the same material or will regular
&gt; vacuum line work?
