&gt; Can anyone recommend a good place to mount a fire extinguisher?  I
&gt; bought a 1kg powder extinguisher a few months back and I can't
decide on
&gt; the best place to put it.  It's just rolling around under the sink at
&gt; the moment.  It needs to be within easy reach of the drivers seat for
&gt; rapid deployment, but not somewhere I'm going to trip over it.  So far
&gt; I've thought of between the back of the seat and the bulkhead (a bit
&gt; tight) or between the seat and the door (would make it difficult to
&gt; slide the seat back and forth).
&gt; So, any better ideas out there?

OK, you want to use an extinguisher.  Obviously, you don't want it to
be in a place where you have to go into the vehicle (which is
presumably on fire!) to get it.  This makes the behind-seat location
very attractive, as you can easily grab the extinguisher on your way
out.

The problem here is that the typical mount won't let you pull the
extinguisher out without unlatching something.  You can do better than
this!  make your own mount out of PVC pipe or similar, that cradles
the fire extinguisher.  Have the open end toward the door and somewhat
higher than the closed end to keep the extinguisher secure.  Having
the extinguisher easy to get out will also help you pull the
extinguisher out for its weekly shaking (you have to shake dry
chemical fire extinguishers now and then to keep the powder loose and
ready to spray).

Please don't think that a 1-kg dry chemical extinguisher will have any
effect on an engine fire.  You might as well spit on it!  2-kg is very
marginal, and 5-kg might give you a fighting chance if you are good
with it.
