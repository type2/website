Subject: Re: [T2] ATF filler tube question

On Mon, 16 Jun 2003, Greg Thompson wrote:

&gt; hey Volks, on my 79 Auto tranny Westy, the ATF filler tube is one
&gt; piece.  Every pic I've seen (including ETKA) shows a 2 piece filler tube
&gt; which seperates somewhere near where the engine and transmission join. 
&gt; I wish mine were that way because when I want to remove the engine only,
&gt; I have to remove the entire tube necessitating draining the
&gt; transmission.  Do I have some kind of strange setup or were 79's like
&gt; this.  Would a 2 piece tube fit?  (if I could find one)...TIA  Greg

yup me too, I've seen a lot of auto tranniees over the years and I have
yet to see a two piece filler tube,  I have seen straight ones and angled
ones but never a two piece one...
