Hi Volks,

My name is Meredith and I have a '79 2000 FI Kombi and her name is Isobel.  
I have been searching through the library and the archives for about a week 
as I didn't want to pose my question without checking for an answer myself 
first.  I am not a premiere mechanic as many of you listers seem to be but I 
fairly competent and I plan on learning my girls engine inside and out over 
time.

My problem is this.  Took the bus to the San Raphael Swell in Central Utah 
and she ran great the whole time.  No weird noises and the gauges were all 
straight up where they ought to be.  Coming down out of a canyon late Sunday 
night, the RPMs dropped to 0 in a split second with no other indications of 
power loss.  I still had power and ignition.  She would turn over but not 
catch.   I managed to get my little boys home with the help of a nice 
missionary couple and I went back to her in the morning and she started 
right up, first time, no problem.  So, I decided to drive her home with my 
back up vehicle following.  She ran fine all day and then in the middle of 
the blasted I15 Freeway, she died in the same manner as the night before.  I 
waited for a couple of hours and she would not start so I had to call 
Allstate and have them come and get me because the seven highway patrolmen 
that I spoke to didn't want me to stay and I didn't want to stay where I was 
either.  Very scary spot!

So, I am assuming, I have spark, I have fuel, I have a new ignition module, 
and I am guessing that it might be the coil as I know that if the coil gets 
hot it might not run and when it is completely cooled it will.  My bus did 
start the next day and thankfully she is sitting in my driveway now.  I hope 
it is the coil because that would be a good project for me to tackle.

Anyone have any suggestions for me.  I guess I need to go buy a voltmeter 
and a torque wrench to add to my tool collection.  Any advice would be much 
appreciated.  I really miss her and it has only been a day or two since I 
haven't been able to climb up in her and take off.

Pieces,

Meredith &amp; Isobel '79 Kombi
