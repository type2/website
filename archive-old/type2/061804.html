&gt; I've been told I can make money fast over the internet, too.  :)  Amsoil is
&gt; a good synthetic oil - so is Royal Purple.  They both might be a little
&gt; better than Mobil 1 but you can buy Mobil 1 at any Wal Mart anywhere in the
&gt; States, and Mobil 1 is cheaper ($4/quart).  Any of them are more than
&gt; adequate for a bus engine.

David:
Locally, at FLAPS and K-mart, we can buy synthetics in Castrol and
Quaker State as well as Mobil. I've tried both in my diesel Vanagon
and waterboxers and while they started well because of decreased
viscosity, I experienced softened breather hoses on each that I
attributed to the synthetic oil. K-mart prices were less than $4.00/
quart, but I'd pay more to deal with a place that would take my old oil
for recycling. I really feel that should be part of the bargain. The
state requires it of pop bottles but not oil. I guess that says
something, (duh).
Anyone else get soft hoses from synthetics or is this just my
imagination?
