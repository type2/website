I'm still trying to narrow it down, i think it may be either crap in the tank,
or the pushrod (or both).......When I put in my new fuel pump, I couldn't
figure out how to get the push rod out, either that or it just didn't want to
come out, i pulled on it but it didn't want to come out.  Should I pull on it
harder to try and pull it out, will I hurt anything but pulling harder on it,
I don't want to break anything and it didn't seem to want to come out to
easily.  Thanks for any help, i'll burn up the rest of my gas and check that
filter for any lovely rust gunk left over too.

Thanks again for everyone's help so far!
Shawn
