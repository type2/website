Subject: New Westy Owner - Sliding Door Question

I am a long time Type 1 owner, recently converted to Type 2 !  Purchased a 1978 Westy in very solid condition, but neglected by the previous owner. I have recently installed used replacement wiper motor.. now wipers work ! Also installed missing sink/stove cabinet that was missing when I bought the bus, however have not hooked up the gas or water yet (May need help on that later).

Immediate problem is that the sliding door is hard to open from both outside and inside. I removed the door panel and took a look. I did not see any adjusting nut for the cable on my 1978 per suggestions on some previous posts. Must only be for earlier years ?The problem seems to be in the front handle mechanism. You can turn it almost all the way down before it even enages the cable with any resistance. Is there some type of adjustment in the front handle mechanism ? I did not take it apart yet.. hoping to get some ideas from the list first ! How are you suppossed to adjust this on the 1978 model ?

Thanks also for all the posts on the tires. I found that I had normal passenger tires with a lot of good tread left. Thanks to the posts for making me aware of the safety issues. I replaced with a new set of load range D Cooper Tires and they are great ! Feels a lot better to know we are riding on the correct load tires !

Thanks
