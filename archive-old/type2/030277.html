&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; I was driving along last night when all of a sudden the clutch pedal
&gt; hits the floor when shifting.  I limp the '70 westy into a Dunkin
&gt; Dounut's parking lot.  Climb underneath and see that the clutch cable is
&gt; frayed and hanging on by a strand.  While Emma my 16 month old is
&gt; snoozing away, I replace the clutch cable.  The clutch would not
&gt; engage.  It was getting dark and I decided to limp the bus home.
&gt; Started him in second and only stalled once.  I started to think about
&gt; what happened last October to my other westy.  One of the arms that hold
&gt; the throw out bearing snapped.  Having a day to think about it.  I might
&gt; have not adjusted the wingnut enough.  How much is the arm on the tranny
&gt; suppose to move?

As I recall, from the fully released position the top of the lever moves
1/2 to 1 inch before the throwout bearing makes contact.  I think that you
mean that your clutch won't disengage, since you drove the vehicle without
it.  Tighen the wing nut some more and see if that fixes the problem.

George
