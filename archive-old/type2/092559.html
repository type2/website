I developed an oil leak myself recently. Pulled the motor after confirming=

I found the following by inspection and will replace/fix accordingly. The=20

portions of the cylinder cooling fins were contaminated with flotsom which=

defects found and insure much more life from this motor.

I'm replacing the push rod tubes and seals as well. Also, retorqued the=20

starter because of a few incidents of hot start clicking during 100=B0 runs=

prolonging this one but a few more years with the relay kit, simply a waste=

I will also point out, under the breather can the aluminum is as clean as=20

You will have to remove the tin and inspect your motor to see what needs to=

be done. This can only be done by actual inspection.
