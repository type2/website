Subject: beep beep

Hello All   The beep beep made me think about the april fools day joke the 
guys played on me They put a VW bus horn under the comode and ran wires outside 
the door so that when I went in they blew the horn, scared the crap out of me 
he he he I thought that I just got ran over by a bug. I started to get mad but 
couldn't quit laughing   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import
