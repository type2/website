X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL


My friend, a long time 69 Volkswagen bug owner, sent me this e-mail of
advice.  Can anyone comment on this and state any possible objections?
Thanks.

Here is a grocery list of little things I have gathered over the years:

Get gas shocks.  You will notice the ride up front get a little bumpier, but

the handling overall will show a BIG improvement.  It will stop the 
sagging-ass thing that most busses suffer from, and will really tighten up 
the steering by cutting out the tendency to sway when changing lanes and
stuff

Bosch ignition parts are pricey, but the quality is well worth the money, 
especially the points.

Replace the fan belt once a year, and more often than that if necessary.  To

get an idea of the kind of stress those things are under, take your
generator 
out with the fan attached and hold it in one hand.  With the other hand grab

the small pulley and spin the thing up.  Now think that the motor has to
take 
it from 900 to ~2800 rpm in about 3.5 seconds, then back down to 900 again.

I have never had a fan belt break outright, but they do get hard and glazed.

When this happens they start to slap and to slip no matter how tight you
make 
them.  You will start to hear a noise from your motor like a piece of tin 
rattling every time you rev it up, then let off the gas.  I went nuts trying

to tighten screws and find the damn piece of metal that was rattling, until
I 
noticed once that it was coming from the fanbelt slipping and slapping. I am

not even going to mention what this does to the volume of cooling air
passing 
through the motor

Don't store shit in the engine compartment.

Forget about the stock VW jack, unless you want to crumple some 
quarter-panels. That baby is just for show.

Increase in temperature= increase in octane requirement for motor to run 
without pinging

Decrease in atmospheric pressure= increase in octane requirement for motor 
to run without pinging

You will notice this the first time you take it into high mountains.  I
guess 
hell for VWs would be summer in a mile high desert with a gas station that 
only sells EC-1 regular 

heaven might be Valdez Alaska in winter, I dunno

Actually VWs shine most in really cold weather.  They aren't desert cars
like 
everyone believes

Get a dwell/tach to set the idle.  Don't even bother trying to do it by ear 
unless it is an emergency- you'll always get it wrong

Plugs should be medium gray, not reddish brown.  Air-cooleds run around 
280-360 degrees and incinerate the air/fuel mix.  The cooler temps of the 
water pumper may leave a reddish brown residue, but VW burns it hot and 
completely 

Oil, Air and FUEL all act as coolants in air-cooled motors.  Make sure the 
mix is right (not too lean) or it will overheat.

Set the mix/idle on a thoroughly warm engine during the heat of the day, 
never at night or in the morning.  Aspirated motors are really sensitive to 
air temperature/density and atmospheric pressure (more so than injected 
motors- you ought to check out the history of flight, and notice that planes

were only able to fly really high after fuel injection was invented, and
even 
higher after the jet engine.  Carbs work off of differences in air pressure,

and when the air pressure gets too low, they stop working) If you set the
mix 
or the idle when it is cold out, or with a cold motor, it will wander and 
change later.

There are certain speeds you will have to avoid.  for my car, they are
~15mph 
(1st), ~30 (2nd), ~45 (3rd) and ~50 (4th).  Learn to work the gears and the 
powerband.  Those engines make good low end torque for their size, but you 
can't lug them or they'll overheat from too much load and too little cooling

air.  You can't overrev them either, or engine life will be cut down because

of vibration (no harmonic balancers on these babies!) and you will gobble 
fuel needlessly.
