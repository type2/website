Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Injection Harness Testing

Hi Michael,

I have the wiring diagram at home from the Bosch &quot;ProTraining&quot; manual, 
it does a great job of explaining the layout of the harness. It also 
tells how to test the components of the system with the harness still 
attached.

I put it online a few weeks ago but we're having a glitch with the 
server, so I'll try to dig it up and temporarily re-post the pages you 
need tonight at www.pottsfamily_dot_ca.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; One more for the FI Savist out there. I am finishing up my FI rebirth 
&gt; on &quot;el Verde&quot; and I want to test my wiring harness. It is not 
&gt; installed and I need some direction as to what pins to what wires to 
&gt; check for what resistance, etc. Bentley touches on this but shows only 
&gt; one test being performed and does not list results or others. Anybody 
&gt; have any quick links to this process or have any guidelines general or 
&gt; specific that could help me out.
