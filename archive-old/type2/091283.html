Subject: Re: [T2] cyl head removal 75 bus


 appears to
&gt; be running on 3 cyls, can I pull the head with the
engine in
&gt; the bus or is it engine 
&gt; removal time
&gt; 
&gt;I would do a compression test to make sure whats
wrong, before taking the head off, it can be removed
with the engine in the bus, but for a job of that size
I think it would be easer on you to pull the engine.
Phil
