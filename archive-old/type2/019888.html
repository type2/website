&gt; So what is the best radio setup for a 1971-1979 bus??

Not claiming this to be the best, only one of many possibilities.

I installed a nice Pioneer AM / FM / Casette, ($50.00 at a political fund
raising silent auction).  The PO had a knob type Pioneer and mine was a DIN
style.  I used a dremmel tool to clearence the opening for the mounting
sleeve and everything slipped together nicely. The door panels were already
cut with speakers installed.  I used a metal plate behind the door panel to
act as a backing plate for the speaker mounting screws.  I also put extra
plastic over the rear of the speakers to prevent water damage.  As I have a
Westy, the PO installed the rear speakers in the forward edge of the storage
box under the fold down seat.  Works fine.  The casette comes in handy for
books on tape on the long trips.  If you have a passenger bus, I would use
speaker boxes for rear speakers rather than cutting into any panels.

Soldier and shrink wrap all wire conections / splices.

My opinion is to do it how you would like it to be.  Stock, if you want to
attend concours events.  Then only an original VW factory radio will do.
What ever you want if you want to drive and enjoy it,  Pleanty of room for a
CD changer in the bus.

What ever you do, Keep smiling,

Mike D.
