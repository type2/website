&lt;&lt; Ok here's another tangent. Some one mentioned that VW 
Trends trademark was dead. That reminded me of the last 
issue that I bought. One of the editors was complaining 
about his bad custmer service experiences when dealing 
with &quot;large corporations&quot;.  &gt;&gt;

Another tangent: Phil Knight, the head honcho at Nike, is
often credited with taking &quot;branding&quot; to incredible eco-
nomic returns. Nike is sold at an incredible price - the
fact that there's a pair of sneakers to carry the logo
is secondary. Other corporations, and VW obviously,
are following suit. Often the &quot;brand&quot; is leased out to
ludicrous proportions - &quot;Mack&quot; work boots at K-Mart,
a &quot;Johnny Walker&quot; clothing line, etc. By grabbing as
many VW-related words/logos/whatever, the ad or
product dept. at VW are making sure they (and no-
one else) has control over them. Another good ex-
ample is Harley-Davidson...they've trademarked
just about everything even vaguely related to the
bike; most of the nicknames that the bike acquired
over the years are now H-D owned. I don't know how
&quot;protective&quot; H-D is about them...But H-D even tried
to trademark the sound of the engine!
VW (I'm sure) realizes the value of their &quot;brand&quot;,
and wants to make sure they get full value for
it's use.
