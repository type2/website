&gt; Being a teacher, I know of a number of districts who offer &quot;Virtual
&gt; School&quot; where all the lessons are online.  Tests are taken at testing
&gt; centers around the US.  Districts have gone to this in order to
&gt; insure students in their district who they are still responsible for
&gt; even if they are home schooled will pass proficiency exams and No
&gt; Child Left Behind.
&gt;
   That's fine for scholastic proficiency, but schools/neighborhoods
teach socialization (or should). There was an episode of &quot;Boston
Public&quot; a few years ago and the gist was that one of the students
was livng with her mother in a (Gasp!) VW Bus...I wonder how a
kid would react to other kids asking him/her &quot;Where do you live?&quot;
