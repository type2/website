I just bought a daily driver off of a kid, so if you are looking for 
something to hop into and drive, here ya go. Some front brake work just 
done. I know he was taking it to a local VW mechanic that was very good, so 
the work was done right. Good strong running dual port engine. It has the 
bed setup from a Westfalia. Needs rear bumper and new ignition switch.   Go 
to this link for some pictures. Located in North Central Florida.

I also have 3 other bay windows (70-71) with no engines. Clearing room, so 
all for $700.
