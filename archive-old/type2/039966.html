Subject: rear wheel cylinders

Back in January I ordered a pair of rear wheel cylinders for my
71 bus from JC Whipme. I'll never learn.  Anyway, not only did
they send me two pair and bill me for both, I did not get around
to working on my brakes until yesterday. And of course they are the
wrong ones. They probably fit the later (73-79?) busses.

Since it is too late to return them, anybody need them cheap?
I'm in San Diego, so it ought to be somebody nearby that can 
look at them and see if they are the right ones for you. They
cost me $16.99 each, I think. I have four.
