Subject: Bus For Sale - Missoula, Montana

List,
My work will be taking me from Montana to Albuquerque, New Mexico and after meeting with a moving compnay, I have decided to leave my van behind.  It is a '72 camper with a top that pops up to another bed.  I replaced the engine a year and a half ago.  It is currenty set-up with a single carb and doesn't especially like the colder weather.  I have the proper carb, plus additional parts for the taking.  There is also an oil leak that I kept meaning to address...
I haven't yet decided on a price, but to an interested list member I am willing to let it go cheap.  There is some body damage to the front left.  Let me know if you in the area and are interested in taking a look at it.  It has potential.
Along those lines, anyone in the Albuquerque area with a spare bus?  I will be in the market once I get set up.
Billy Ray
Missoula, Montana
