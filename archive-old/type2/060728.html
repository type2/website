Subject: More cylinder #1 woes

I have been trying to trouble shoot this thing forever and can't figure it
out.  Here's the situation.  I have a '73 bus with dual carbs.  I recently
install a 2000cc engine in place of the 1800cc that was there.  I am
pretty sure that the engine was already replaced once before by a PO.
Anyway I have all the original accesories on this bad boy, dist, carbs,
muffler,... all of it.  

I was having trouble with it running rough and chugging black smoke.  I
pulled each spark wire one at a time and the number 1 cylinder doesn't
cause any drop in the RPMs.  All the other cylinders are working great
with a decided drop in RPM.  The spark plugs on the left(drivers side)
look perfect, no carbon or fouling, just right.  However the passenger
side plugs are sooty.  BTW timing is at 10 degrees.  It runs pretty smooth
for having one cylinder not firing.

I can't seem to figure out why that #1 won't fire but #2(same side) is.  I
went through the electrical system and there are no problems.  If I hold
the #1 sparkplug wire at the sparkplug end I can get a good 1&quot;-1.5&quot; blue
spark.  And I have changed the sparkplug twice and even tried one from
another cylinder.  The compression tests show even compression for wet and
dry test for all cylinders(something like 120+/-2 dry, if I remember
corectly).

As far as I can tell the only thing left is the fuel delivery system.  The
electrical is great the internals are great.  I always though that if
there was a vacuum leak it would cause it to lean out.  But the plugs are
sooty.  If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it.
