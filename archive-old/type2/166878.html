Subject: Fwd: [T2] Interior Panel Clips?

There is a place here in Arlington Texas, called &quot;The Bug Stop&quot; that seems to have all of those hard-to-find items... And they are very nice and helpful

www.texasbugstop_dot_com
3622 Graves Blvd
Pantego, Texas 76013
817-274-7890

There is also a place in Grand Prairie Texas, more of a mechanic than a shop, the guy that runs it is sort of a grumpy old SOB, but he's got a stash of misc parts like that too.

I'm not advertising, or endorsing them... Just another resource for you.

Hope it helps
Chris

?Hey All,

I'm having trouble finding those black plastic clips
that hold some of the interior panels
