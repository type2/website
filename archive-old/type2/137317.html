&gt; I just ponied up the dough for a SVDA distributor from Aircooled_dot_net:

Just get a Pertronix 1847V and put it in your SVDA.  Works great  
(that's what I use).

&gt; So my question is, did I buy the wrong thing? Anybody have experience  
&gt; with the electronic conversion kit? I wish I had seen this sooner, I'd  
&gt; have just spent the extra $20 or so for this instead of just the  
&gt; better points distributor. Does this have a good advance curve, or  
&gt; does that even apply to an electronic ignition? Since this is computer  
&gt; controlled will it just always find the best time to spark?

Electronic ignition just replaces the points.  Dwell is perfectly  
stable, no moving parts to replace at tune-up time.
