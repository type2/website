Subject: Re:What makes up the floor of a westy

Matt,
    You asked on the type 2 list.....&quot;- What makes up the floor of a
westy Plywood, etc? has anyone rebuilt the floor?&quot;

I redid the floor in our 71 westy a couple of years ago and am very
happy with the results.  First thing is to remove ALL the furniture
from the interior in the back.  Then take out the old flooring right
down to the metal.  While the metal is exposed repair any rust and
give the metal floor a good coat of paint.  The new floor I made
consisted of a bottom layer of 11/32 inch extiorior plywood.  Then a
layer of 1/8 inch masonite.  Then I glued down a layer of Armstong
commercial grade floor tiles.  Since the floor in the back of the bus
is more than 48 inches in both directions each layer of wood has to be
2 pieces.  Put the seams perpendicular to each other.  Also, I screwed
and glued the masonite to the plywood.  The results were the right
height so no gap is under the edges of the furniture.  The floor is
solid and easy to clean.
