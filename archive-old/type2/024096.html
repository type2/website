Subject: 944 Porsche Engine in bus
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Someone mentioned using a 944 Porsche engine in their bus.  

While there is more than adequate horsepower, even with the non-turbo engine,
the 944 engine has some expensive long-term service concerns that could cause
future headaches. Beside the issue of a $100+ rebuilt water pump with a very
short half-life and specialized, expensive motor mounts needed due to the
rotational vibrations of such a large 4-cylinder engine which must be
frequently changed in the 944, the biggest problem with the engine is the cam
belt--the one that requires frequent timing belt replacement and adjustment.
Adjustment requires a $450+ gauge and tool to do correctly.  I forget the
termonology, but the valves hit the hit the tops of the pistons when the belt
breaks and reek havoic--like $2,000 worth--for a top-end rebuild.

The engine is also very big and heavy. I don't think it is a very good choice
for use in a bus unless you have deep pockets ($$$).
