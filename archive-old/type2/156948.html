&gt; As I have mentioned earlier, passed test ready to go etc,  but one tiny
&gt; problem I can select reverse WITHOUT pressing the gearstick down, it
&gt; just slides right in, this could be problematic at freeway speeds.  The
&gt; other gears are all fine if not a bit stirry.

&gt; I have replaces all the bushes, clutch etc during the rebuild.

&gt; I have checked the shift plate and stick postion as per Bently several
&gt; times?  Any ideas???

SWAG guess:  Is the shift plate upside down?
