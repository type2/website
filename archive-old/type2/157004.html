Subject: Re: [T2] T O or release bearing early bus/beetle

ok so i found the parts locally well sort of but close enough that i wil be able to do the work now this weekend...
   
  and it was the super hooks that i was able to find...
   
  ok the throw out beaing looks to be ok but i would like a 2nd opinion...
  heres the link...
  http://s85.photobucket_dot_com/albums/k79/locovwbus/68%20Beetle%20release%20bearing/
   
  seems to just have a couple of nicks in the side but nothing wrong with the disc or the bearings.... 
   
  if it is to bad i gotta get one tomorrow when i got get the other parts....?
  but i am looking at it thinking it looks fine... the holes on the sides(hanger holes) also look fine...
   
  i still plan to wire the super hooks on though just in case so this  wont happen again....
   
  just need reassurance the TO beaing looks ok...
  thanks
  chai

&gt; &gt;forks are available, including &quot;heavy duty&quot; versions that last longer.

&gt; Isn't the big difference between the OEM version and the H-D versions
&gt; the welds? Seems like I bought one 15 yrs ago and the original version
&gt; had spot welds and the H-D version was fulled welded. If so, weld the
&gt; OEM version and you've got a H-D version.

The good ones also have thicker material in the forks. Instead of a
little divot on the front (FIF) side of the &quot;hook&quot; there is a hole with
material ahead of it. This stops the hooks from breaking off at the
&quot;divot&quot; when they wear.

You're right about the welding, though. If I pull a throwout fork out and
it isn't completely welded I will weld it up. However, if the hooks are
worn the fork is trash unless you can weld up the fork a bit and reshape
the ends.
