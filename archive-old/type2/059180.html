Subject: Brake fluid reservoir for 68 type 2

Maybe someone here has this part, I'm running out of places to check.
I'm told that this is a &quot;one-year only&quot; part, found on 68 models only
(figures, ran into that problem when I replaced brake hoses). Anyway,
this reservoir mounts under the dash on the front panel, and connects to
a metal pipe (about 7/16&quot; diameter) leading to the master cylinder with
a plastic nut. Just had the Westy painted last month after mucho body
work, and last week I find brake fluid running down the side of the
wheel arch, so of course it ate a nice 1/4&quot; trail of paint away....not a
problem, I have lots of touchup paint, but I must replace that nasty
piece-o-plastic before I fix this blemish. If no one has  the reservoir,
any ideas on how to make a different model work will be greatly
appreciated. Thanks in advance!
