thanks guys/gals, i was thinking i wouldn't put a bug engine in my van
(van is automatic trans.) for the reason it would not be alot of power.
i have a bently manual and i thought my 75' van was a type 2? you all
are talk'n it is a type4. what is the diff between type2 and 4? anyways
i can not rebuild my engine, the case is cracked and has holes in it cos
the *&amp;^% person b4 me who had the van ran it without oil. So i am
looking for a good used 2.0L or 1.8(no smaller), i live in Canada Nova
Scotia so i can't go to the states.  If anyone knows anywhere in my
region there is a deal on an engine or engine/attached van combo i would
be most grateful if you could enlighten me. thanks for the help!
