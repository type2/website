&gt;If you can't turn it by hand, don't use the starter...you'll burn it out.
&gt;You need to figure out why it's not turning freely. Forget about starters
&gt;and points; nothing electrical could cause the engine itself to jam. You
&gt;need to get the engine to the point where you can turn it by hand (with a
&gt;wrench on the alternator bolt):
&gt;
&gt;1) Make sure it's in neutral
&gt;2) Did you actually try turning the engine with the starter removed?
&gt;3) Did you by chance try turning the engine _after_ you bolted the tranny
&gt;on? Maybe there was some kind of clutch issue?
&gt;
&gt;You could try loosening the bolts that hold the tranny &amp; engine together,
&gt;pry them apart a little, wiggle, then retorque.
&gt;
&gt;If all that fails, maybe you need to drop the engine, take off the tranny
&gt;and check out the clutch. Did you put the pressure plate in the right way?
&gt;(I don't know if that would cause binding?)
&gt;
&gt;Worst case, some bolt or tool got into maybe an intake valve or the case and
&gt;has jammed. save this for last, Unless you're unexplicably missing a small
&gt;tool :O(
