Mine goes off the scale (40+) and it seems to run just fine.  Don't get
hung up on that 30 number.  But make sure the engine is not detonating
(knocking).

&gt;Ok...  I'm not sure if I have a dual or a single advance.  When I checked
&gt;the manuals, the timing settings were based on an engine code and a dizzy,
&gt;and did not mention single or double advance dizzys.  I have one vacuum
&gt;line coming from the bottom left of the vacuum chamber that runs to the
&gt;carb, and a line on the back that runs to the exhaust manifold.  Does this
&gt;sound right.  Is this single or double.

If it has two hoses coming off of the canister, then it's a double.
Neither one should be going to the exhaust manifold  The lower/inside one
is retard and should be going to the intake manifold and the upper/outside
one is advance and should go do the carb.
