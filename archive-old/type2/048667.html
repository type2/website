Hi Meredith,

You mentioned this happening with your bus:

&lt;snip&gt;
  I ask because after a day of sitting, the bus starts fine and
if I only go short distances it runs fine.  It starts every time, first try,
aside from the cold morning starts, then it takes a few tries.&lt;/snip&gt;

When I first bought my bus, it has a ton of crud in the fuel tank.  I 
was having the same problem, and it was the fuel filter clogging. 
After it sat overnight, the clog would have settled, and I could 
drive again.  It got worse and worse, and took a long time to figure 
out.

Try changing the filter and see if it helps.  Symptoms sound the 
same.  I cracked the old filter open and found it packed with rust 
flakes and such.

Good Luck,

ned
