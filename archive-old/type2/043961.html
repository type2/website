&gt; &gt; Good Dr. Tim recommended checking the &quot;crankshaft endplay.&quot;  I have the 
&gt; &gt; Hayes, &amp; think I have an idea of what you're referring to, Doc.  It sounds 
&gt; 
&gt; No, endplay is checked externally.  Just attach a dial indicator to the
&gt; case with the stem touching the flywheel and pointing parallel to the

or there is a method for doing this without a dial indicator.
there is a description of this method in one of the manuals, or if not in
the library FAQ.  only takes a bolt and some feeler guages


&gt; &quot;new&quot; range (.003-.005 inch)  The wear limit is .006 inch.  Do not accept
&gt; an engine with an end play greater than .005.  Even if you have to walk
&gt; for a few days, it isn't worth it to install a junk engine.

very good point, my first engine rebuild I neglected this point and got
exactly 1 block before my engine siezed

&gt; Nope, it's impossible to do the other way round.  Well, not impossible,
&gt; but pretty difficult.  You leave off the rear and side cover plates, as
&gt; well as the oil filler, until the engine is in

also leave off the coil
&gt; 
&gt;   What about the &quot;shaft&quot; that goes 
&gt; &gt; between the transmission &amp; the engine (don't know the common name/couldn't 
&gt; &gt; seem to find in Hayes).  Is there any special way this should be installed 
&gt; &gt; into the motor &amp; the tranny?
&gt; 
&gt; OH-OH!  Are you telling us that the transmission input shaft came out of
&gt; the transmission?  If so, you've got a transmission repair on your hands
&gt; before you can install the engine.  The input shaft should be firmly
&gt; attached to the transmission.

well unless it is an automatic, in which case the oil pump shaft does
indeed come out. and is just pushed in to the center of the tranny
twisting to make sure the splines seat.
