hello list    It is my understanding that you need a full flow oil filter for 
synthetic oil .  The other thing is you need a tight engine cause synthetic 
tends to seep more.  We use synthetic in all the formula vees that we race 
for the horsepower and cooling gain.       Mark Dearing   Salem Import Service
