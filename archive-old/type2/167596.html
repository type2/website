&gt; install supply and return fuel lines

while doing this I reccomend you put in two ball valves of the type used
in household gas lines.  you will give thanks every time you have to
change a fuel filter or remove engine in the future.  cost maybe $10
total, I used a hose clamp to secure to nearby frame piece.

&gt; It's been a fun couple of days.  I've learned a lot.  Still have a ways
&gt; to go though.

good luck and have fun
