&gt; Sure, the lower bed may be wider, but isn't the fold out cot in the pop
&gt; top pretty much worthless? I've never slept in the fold out cot, but at
&gt; 6'4&quot;  and 180lbs, it does'nt sound too appealing to me. I've slept in

--&gt; 1975 campers have the same poptop as 1976-79 models, with the
full-size bed.  I'm 6'0&quot; and it's more than long enough for me, at least a
good foot longer than the bottom bed.  My only complaint about the 1975
model is that the stove cabinet makes it bloody hard to get the sliding
door shut, unless you grease the track really well.
