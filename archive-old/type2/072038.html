Subject: Re: [T2] 3 things around the turn signal

&gt;Sounds like your hoses that go from the reservoir to the switch on the
&gt;column have started to rot, I would tell you how to replace them but I have
&gt;been putting off doing mine for the last year or so.
&gt;Hope this helps.

welp, it turned out to be very easy surgery. disconnect the battery ground
strap. plip off the horn button, and pull the wheel. i used a 15/16&quot;. go
under the wheel, look up, and pull the three connectors (electrical
bundles). unscrew the 4 flathead screws holding down the turn signal
switches. ease out the turnsignal and wiper switches together - gingerly
and mind that there are weenie spacers between them that if dropped would
be hell to find again. so, keep the switches together, as they hang out,
and the spacers will not travel. (this is all ver-r-ry easy). concerned
about this, i left the 4 screws in place, and shut the driver's door in
case one fell out.

i chose to work on the rubber windshield hoses while their valve was still
connected to the wiper switch. i suppose you could unscrew the valve with a
tiny phillips. instead, i held the switches, pulled each hose, snipped
them, and returned them to the proper stem one at a time. consider testing
the valve by blowing into it while each hose is off to help determine if
the valve is holding at least your own compressed air.

before i out the wheel back on, i repaired a hole in my horn contact
spring. its hole was half the width of the entire copper spring. fillling
it with solder didn't work - hole was too big. so i smoothed out the solder
lump and took off the excess, and used copper foil tape i had on hand
(found in all stained glass supply stores - don't buy it, ask for an inch).
layed the tape over the hole and let each end overlap and finish under the
copper spring. a coat of solder over the tape and celebrate with horn
revelry. test drive is encouraged.
it works so far...
