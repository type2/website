Subject: Late Bus Shifting Woes

Hello Volks.

Yesterday my '74 (2.0 liter with '79 transmission) developed a little
shifting problem.  (Today, I recall having a shifting problem the
previous day, but attributed it at the time to deficient dexterity on my
part.)  The problem is that I sometimes can't get it into the gear I
want, particularly first gear, though at one point I couldn't get
anything but third (and had to drive home that way with a load of
drywall in the back -- starting up from a dead stop was hairy).  I
replaced the shifter assembly up front a year or two ago, and it still
feels good.  When the shift lever is in the first gear position, the
coupling and hockey stick appear to be where they should be.  Moreover,
the shift coupling doesn't seem to have too much play.  When driving, I
was able to find all the gears for a few minutes, and then it'd be back
to not being able to find them, without any apparent pattern that I
could detect -- I haven't done much driving around since discovering the
problem; I just headed straight home.  Also, I've never experienced any
popping out of gear with this transmission.  All this, and the new
leakage of gear oil up at the nose cone leads me to think I've got a
nose cone problem.  (Re: the leak, I seem to recall a little weep hole
on the top of the nose cone area -- can anyone fill me in on its
purpose?)  I'm going to check the fluid level as soon as I get some kind
of tool for that 17mm socket plug on the side (I'm going to try welding
a 17mm nut on a nice fat bolt to use as a socket tool).

I've seen Ron Van Ness's nice '71 info in the library and I've found
some useful stuff in the archives; but I'm hoping somebody can reassure
me that I'm on the right track -- I'd hate to pull the tranny for
nothing.  Or better, perhaps point out some obvious little fix that will
save me from pulling the transmission -- wishful thinking, hmm?

I'd be happy to hear from anyone with late transmission nose cone parts
info or experience, though I may just do a quick swap and replace the
whole tranny with a spare I have from my dear departed '76.
