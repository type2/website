Correct, pressure or vacuum, air should flow in one direction with no
resistance and should not flow the other no matter what.

&gt; On my bus I can blow through both ways with one way

Your check valve is broken.

&gt; Should I just replace the thing??

Yes.  Having a broken check valve will not cause a vacuum leak if the
system is tight, BTW.  The purpose of the check valve is to retain some
vacuum in the booster after the engine has shut down.  This keeps the
vacuum assist working for a couple brake applications after your engine
dies in traffic so you can stop safely or so you can keep the bus from
rolling if the parking brake does not hold, etc.  If you can leg press 500
pounds, you can probably live without it, but if not, it can be important.
