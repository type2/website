&gt;Should I be worried? Synchros now work, even when cold.

&gt;p.s. Dr. Tim recommends GL3!

I sure what I intended to convey was that when Porsche originally designed
the spezially surfaced sycro ring design, GL-3 was the spec. GL-4 works
just fine. GL-5 is TOO SLICK and the syncro will slip excessively and wear
out the surface, requiring teardown to replace the syncros.

Valvoline makes a nice 85/90 GL-3/4 lube. That's what I use for all apps
that call for the earlier spec.
