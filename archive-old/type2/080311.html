Brant---

You can rub, and buff, and wax, but like you think, the finish just
won't last that long for the amount of labor involved.

Just painted a Chevy Van for a customer, and the material alone cost
$725.00 for PPG Concept single stage white.

Green my cost a little more beause of the pigment's needed to create the
color---

Break the piggy bank and pop for the paint job----your satisfaction will
be your reward.

Later,

Terry

Hello List, 
I think I have found a donor body for my rusty 79 Westfalia. The donor
is a 77 of the same color (&quot;monkey puke green&quot;) It sounds nice and
supposedly has no rust, no major dents and a nice interior. And it's
cheap IMO. The issue is the paint. From talking to the owner on the
phone (400+ miles away) the paint sounds like it's fairly oxidized. I
was wondering if it can be restored without repainting it? And how will
it hold up over time? I've used rubbing compound with good results but
the shine doesn't seem to last for long. I've browsed the archives and
library but didn't really find anything about bringing old paint back to
life. Maybe its not truly possible. Any links, advice, or procedures
would be greatly appreciated. Or how much would a new paint job using
the better quality paints of today (windows out) cost? I intend to use
the bus primarily for road trips not shows or anything. I just want a
nice bus that won't become another rust bucket. Or if anyone knows of a
nice Westfalia body preferably '78 or '79 sage green anywhere close to
Utah let me know. 
Thanks,
Brandt
'79 Westfalia 
P.S. Also does anyone have or know where I can get a cooling flap
assembly for a 2.0 L. The one with the two flaps, spring, shaft and
clamp that the themostat cable connects to? Thanks! Could trade or buy.
