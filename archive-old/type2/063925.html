You're right in that the Westfalia was the only official conversion, but
the Dormobile must have had some kind of official condonation (even if only
for the UK market) as they were sold by VW dealers -- I know this because I
have a 1962 Martin Walter advertisement which says so, and my 63 Dormobile
was sold by VW Motors, the UK distributor.

Anyone out there know any better?
