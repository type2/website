Oh I am redfaced.  What will everybody think.  Being new am I glad its not
Friday? 

Well here it is.  Confession. I lied.  Well not really lied, just...spaced
it.  I don't really have a ugly (I really think she's quite beatiful in
her own way) grey, misused, gutted camper, vintage 72.  I was leaning over
the passenger seat putting the shifter back in so I could be sure I had it
in neutral while I did a compression test, and my eyes strayed to the VIN.
- -233-.  So, I really have a beatiful, awfully painted, and in need of
mucho TLC '73 campermobile..... 

Anyway, for those that can forgive my slip, the results of the compression
test were--#1, 115 #2, 120 #3, 100 #4, 105.  From what I've read so far
these numbers should be pretty good.  Any comments would be appreciated. 
I have to pull the engine and tranny for clutch and shifter repair. 
Should I be concidering a valve job too? 

Thank you

Shamefaced but recovering,
