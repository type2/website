Subject: broken typeIV fan blade

Hello List:

What happens to the broken piece of the crankshaft mounted fan on a typeIV
motor after it falls into the motor having broken it learning how to rotate
the motor the hard way (I now use the proper procedure)?  It didn't seem to
do anything except for that a couple months later a rackety sound that
couldn't be found could be heard especially after just starting the motor
up.  Could that sound have been that little fan piece getting blown around?
It seems to have gone away.  Or should I worry about it?

Thanks in advance,
Christopher Darilek
