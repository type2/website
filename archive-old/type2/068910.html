Subject: Looking forabus, and FS: parts from the 75 westy

        Turns out i WONT have to go to pekin to get the money for the 
bus, so i would PREFER a bus in the augusta, atlanta, svannah ga, 
columbia SC area, cause its a pain to walk anywhere else..:)

but seriosly, looking for a DEPENDABLE bus, preferably a camper of some 
sort, poptop not nesicary, and prefering one with the t2 engine..
and somewhere in the range of 800-1300$


AND: if you need any parts off my 75 westy, let me know. they are all 
available, even if some are a bit deteriorated. tell me what you need, 
maybe i have it...



Thanks...
