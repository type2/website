Subject: seemless conversion, what do you think???

Hello list,

Here is a picture of a bus that I played with. I
erased the seam on the side of the vehicle. Ok, ok, I
am sure that nightmares of calk and gobs of bondo come
to mind when the phrase &quot;seamless conversion&quot;are used,
but if you can look past that image, how do you think
it looks? Any coments welcome. Please don't be too
ulgy though.:0)
