Subject: Re: [T2] Need help with possible engine purchase

I think this is the wisest advice unless I want to get involved with 
Megasquirt. Do you think these engines are setup with more power but less 
torque?

&gt; Harder to keep running than L-Jet in my opinion but certainly doable.
 Personally I would convert it to L-Jet and benefit from all the help 
because
 you'll be going it along with D-Jet or lucking on the 914 forums for help.

&gt; Buses using these donor engines need torque. That's the number to look at.
