Subject: RE: [T2] Coil Resistance 

I just installed the Crane 700 unit in my bus and I'm using an old Bosch
Blue coil, I was told that it has the Blue Coils have the resistor pack
built in, so fare so good :)
Reading vary Low omega like that, unless you have a Vary Good VOM you'll
never get a good reading.

Subject: [T2] Coil Resistance 


So Santa brought me a sweet electronic ignition kit from Crane. I am
wondering about my coil resistance though. I have read in the instructions
for the kit and the archives about the Bosch Blue coil having  the correct
resistance built into the coil. My 78' FI 2.0 Type IV has a Bosch Black
coil. I have not yet pulled it to check part numbers with the archives but
when I tested the resistance across the + and - I got 1-2 ohms. Now my
meter is not one I am particularly fond of as it is digital and hard to
read IMHO. So my question is will this coil be okay? I think I may need
more resistance like 3-4 ohms, but if I did wouldn't my stock points be
burning up faster? The instructions on the ignition kit say if the module
gets really hot after 15 minutes of running then you don't have enough
resistance at the coil, maybe I should just hook it up and hope it don't
get hot but I don't want to burn up the module...
