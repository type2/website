&gt; M.R.:
&gt; I think the tin is the LEAST of your problems! If
&gt; you're gonna have a
&gt; rigged up bus, why not use furnace tin and
&gt; sheetmetal screws?
&gt; If you are gonna do it the way the factory did you
&gt; need different
&gt; transmission ratios, tranmission input shaft, rear
&gt; engine carrier, and
&gt; throttle cable,  air cleaner and air cleaner
&gt; bracket. Then you
&gt; are going to have a 38 amp generator instead of a 55
&gt; amp alternator.

Thought of all of this.  Of course, alternators are
available for the upright.  And minimal performance
mods will bump the HP up to 1700cc levels-- therefore
no concerns over engine ratios.  

&gt; This is a lame idea unless you are planning to drive
&gt; a lot in the 3rd
&gt; world (where type 4 engines were never marketed.)
&gt; To do a satisfactory, trouble free, job takes either
&gt; about a thousand
&gt; dollars worth of parts or 2000 dollars worth of
&gt; labor to make those parts.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're gonna rig it up, just use chain or rope or
&gt;  threaded rod and see
&gt; how great it works.
&gt; Actually, about the only thing that ever wears out
&gt; in a type 4 engine is
&gt; the heads. NOT the pistons and cylinders, not the
&gt; bottom end.

Funny, I've seen numerous holes in type 4 pistons and
cases.  Owned a 76 that dropped a valve then punched a
hole in the piston in fact.  

&gt; This is a LAME IDEA!

Thanks for you input.  Wanna buy my used type 4 engine
complete?
