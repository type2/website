Subject: Wiring for Bus Tachometer

Hello,

I am trying to figure out the connections for a VDO tachometer.  I have been 
browsing internet resources, and have mixed information.

The terminals look like:
[+12][+6][1][-]

Does anyone know which goes to what on a 12V system (the +12 is self 
explanotory).

Thanks in advance,
Bryan
