&gt; Steve is of course right as he assumes, all that MBZ nut is going to
&gt; be load bearing, hardly any of that Vanagon crimp nut is.
&gt;
&gt; I want a set of those things now, that nut is &quot;money&quot; for us folks
&gt; pissed off at the crappy Vanagon nuts.  What are they off of Karl?
&gt; I haven't had as many issues as Steve has, but I'm tired of buying
&gt; $6 throw away nuts if I can hit a junkyard.

All 116, 123, 126, and 140 body cars. 116 started in 72 with 280SE 6 cyl.
and 450SE + SEL V8's, the 6.9, and the 300SD turbo diesel and lasted til 80.
81 to 91 126 is [USA] 300SD and the 380 + 420 + 500 + 560 V8's. 123 is 77
thru 85 as 240D, 300D, 300DT, 300TD wagon, 280E. 140 was 92 to 99. But
unless it is a total, I doubt you'd find any in the yards.....
More than likely, you will find the 116 and 123's.
