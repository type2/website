Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Shore Power&quot; to charge 2nd Battery

Well, I have two small children that travel better if they are amused. I carry a
tv unit that has dual 5&quot; LCD monitors to keep my kids entertained while we trek
across Ontario and various trips to the USA.

Imagine two kids under 5 in a Bus for a trip from the east coast to the west
coast? This is why Mr. Lyons has a play station.

I think technology in a van is a wonderful thing, unless ofcourse you are
travelling alone.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone else out there hiding any technology in their bus ?
&gt;
&gt; With all this stuff in peoples campers it makes me wonder why they leave home.
&gt; I like camping because theres no phones much less a TV.....Different strokes
&gt; for different folks I guess......Chad
