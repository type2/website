Sounds like a 021-101-107 engine case vibration damper.  $1.30 each.

Subject: [T2] New Plastic stud locks for type IV


&gt; Hi All:
&gt;
&gt; The type IV engine has plastic inserts that go around the six main bolts
&gt; used to hold the case together. They keep the bolts from falling out of
&gt; the case during reassemble and when splitting the case. Anyone know
&gt; where I can get new inserts? Do they come with the gasket kit?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
