last week I went to the junkyard in search of some exhaust parts for my 2L 
engine and was surprised to find a fully intact carburation system 
complete with dual webers mounted on an engine identical to my own. I 
pulled them off without delay. I have a perfecttly good carb that ran my 
1800 just fine. My question is this. Is it worth the added 
maintenance/troublesooting/adjusting/etc?
I planned to have them looked over by a carb expert regardless but a 
mechanic suggested that I just install them and see how it goes first. I 
just want to know if anyone has any advice based on specific experience 
with the webers.p.s. my Faccet electric fuel pump produces 3 psi thanks   
Mickey
