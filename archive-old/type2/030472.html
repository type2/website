Subject: Idiot Light (Dual Brake Circuit Warning Light)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.9910271227190.9232-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

We've done this before, but then after all theseyears, we've pretty much
done everything before :-)

The red light on the dash with a B imprinted on it is the dual circuit
brake warning light.  It is a simple &quot;and&quot; logic that measures voltage
from both of the brake light switches on the master cylinder.  If one is
supplying voltage (is working) and the other is not (is not working) then
the light comes on to let you know that half your brakes have failed.  If
the light comes on when you apply the brakes, it is definitely time to
stop driving and fix something!  Especially if it is a brief flash as the
brakes are engaged!

On different years of bus there are three different bulb tests that are
applied.  On some years, you press the B and it lights, on some years the
bulb comes on when you start the car and goes off when the car starts
(along with the gen light), and on some years the light comes on when the
parking brake is engaged.  

Personally, I don't think much of this warning light, as the inability to
tell when half the brakes are gone is not a widespread problem.  Believe
me, you will know! Now maybe King Kong would not be able to tell, but you
and I will definitely notice :-)  The time to notice, tho is when it is
flashing as you apply the brakes.  this *may* mean that there is a leak
within the master cylinder between the circuits and that one circuit is
failing but the leak is feeding fluid that keeps you from noticing.  If it
flashes, stop and fix it.
