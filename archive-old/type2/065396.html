I have absopositively no silicone on my windshield whatsoever and
it is _still_ rusted out! (Original Gasket) Don't blame the silicone
for what Muddah
Nature bestowed upon yer bus.  .....Or maybe...the FUMES from the
silicone that I used on my Nissan rotted the windshield...Prob.
not. ;)

Somewhere, somehow it is Friday.  (Why can't it be here?!?!?!)
