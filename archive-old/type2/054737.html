Subject: End of the road

Well, it would seem I've hit the end of the road with Kevin... The Devcon
didn't work (tried to seal a crack in the block), and the engine is now
kaput.. (technically speaking)
I've been stranded three times in the last two weeks with it. It's going to
cost me $2000 to get a recon engine put in, of which I don't have. Just
finished paying the $430 for the main seal, clutch etc, put new tyres on it
and paid the rego.. Money well spent.... not.... tsk..
So, thanks for all that  marvellous advice one and all. If I do manage to
afford another aircooled, I'll be back.
Til then, enjoy the ride, love the bumps and wave to everyone you see!!!

Cassandra.
