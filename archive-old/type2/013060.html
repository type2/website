X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

hi there,
I was given this email address from Ron Salmon at the
Bus Depot in regards to a problem that I encountered
last week.  I had purchased a rebuilt head from your
company  last year and had it installed on my bus (73
camper, 74 1800 engine) on April 17th of 2000 at
137,105 miles.  Last week i was going to take my first
camping trip of the spring and had a valve snap and go
through my #4 piston.  I was doing about 60 at the
time and tried to stop immediately when it started to
lose power but the damage was already done.  The
engine was not hot, I could easily touch the oil on
the end of the dipstick and this engine has not been
overheated.  The lower end was just redone by a local
VW shop less than 3000 miles ago.  It was just a day
or two over a year and my mileage is now at 143,332. 
I do not know the full extent of the damage yet but
the head is a total loss and so is the piston.  I
posted my problem to the the http://www.type2_dot_com
email list which is a group of individuals who drive
vws, of almost 1000 strong.  Your heads and engines
are regarded as one of the best rebuilds on the market
by this list and someone had also mentioned you have a
12 month/12,000 mile warranty on your products and
they encouraged me to email or call you.  I am just
wondering at this point if the warranty does apply to
me and what can be done.  I have heard almost all
positive comments about your company and myself and
the list are eager to hear from you.  I have posted a
few pictures of the head at:

if you would like to see what it looks like.  I am
eager to hear back from you and to get my bus back on
the road.  Thanks for your time.
Shelby Bell
