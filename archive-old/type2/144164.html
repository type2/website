Subject: 5 speed gearbox

Hi all,

I'm an owner of a 1972 T2 bus that was purchased
without engine and it has some rust to repair. I
bought a CU 2.0 Lt type 4 carburatered engine and I
have a
change to have a 5 speed gearbox from a friend's T3.
I've no idea the type/number of it, in order to
identify the model/year of the gearbox.
Nevertheless, it has, I think, a side gear selector
instead of a regular type 1 front nose.
My question is the following: can I install this type
of gear box in
this specific 1972 T2 bus? the engine, I know, it can
be fitted. If yes, what kind of modifications should
be done?

I heard also, that for the regular 4 speed gearbox,
the flywheel should be a Type 1 model. What kind of
modifications it will be subjected, and for a possible
5 speed gearbox with a CU engine what kind of flywheel
can be used?

Thanks in advance

Luis Martins

ps - if anybody out there speake portuguese can
contact me directly,
please?

Thanks

Luis
