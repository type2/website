&gt; I just bought a 72 today.  On the front of the van, just above the left
&gt; headlight there was a rubber plug/gasket covering a hole with what looked to
&gt; be three screw holes surrounding it.  Anyone know any reason why that would be
&gt; there or was someone just trying to install something after they bought it.

It sounds like the hole left when a &quot;ball mount&quot; antenna mount is removed
from the body.  These mounts are used for CB and other communications
antennas.


&gt; I have a feeling you guys will be getting a lot of questions from me in the
&gt; future.  Thanks.

That's what we are here for!  Congrats on your bus purchase.  Have you
replaced all the fuel lines yet?  If not, do so quickly!
