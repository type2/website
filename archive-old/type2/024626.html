Sure, the lower bed may be wider, but isn't the fold out cot in the pop top
pretty much worthless? I've never slept in the fold out cot, but at 6'4&quot; and
180lbs, it does'nt sound too appealing to me. I've slept in the bottom and top
of my '76, and have found both to very comfortable, I just have to remember
not to sit up too fast when I'm on the bottom, otherwise I whack my head on
the overhead cabinet. I slept in the top of mine just a few weeks ago at a
campout in PA, and with a cheap 1500w electric heater I stayed very warm, too
warm in fact, I woke up in the middle of the night and turned it down, the
temp that morning was 18 degrees. FWIW, however, I'd say the Vanagon interior
looks the most comfortable of all.    Jeff S.
