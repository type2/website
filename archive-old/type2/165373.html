Subject: Re: Speed Demons (was Re: [T2] Re: What's your MPG)

&gt; So, when did you re-ring the pistons and/or add new heads.  How old is the
&gt; short-block?  Are you running an oil temp gauge?

Troy may remember better than me. I wanna say... A year and a half
ago? More? It was still his at the time. The heads are older than the
re-ring. I have no idea on the short block.

No gauges at all other than tach and knowing where my foot is on the
throttle. Combining throttle with rpms tells me if I'm pushing the
engine too hard. WOT with low RPMs makes me nervous because of the
slower fan speeds. I'd rather run 60mph (indicated) in 3rd than 65mph
in 4th if I'm over half throttle.

I should point out that we're talking about a 78 bus with stock fuel
injection and 2.0 engine. I doubt a stock 1700 could come close. One
big plus on my engine is the metered fuel flow at any RPM or throttle
position. Carbs have problems since they can be dialed in for only one
set of conditions. They're just a barely controlled leak full of
compromises. With care, carbs can be made to work quite well. But FI
is more consistent and precise.
