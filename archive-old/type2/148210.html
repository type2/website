Subject: Re: [T2] Co-Worker is harassing me!

I like my 72. I had a chance to weld in a hatch, but decided I'd like
to keep it original in that respect. I don't use stock carbs, so the
decreased clutter makes it easier to work on without a hatch.

IIRC, the rear apron was added as a DOT requirement, as was the
firewall behind the fuel tank which was not present in split window
models.

 The '72 is by far the worst.. no top hatch, no removable apron.  I
 think the rear apron changed in order to meet the support
 requirements of the Type 4 engine.
