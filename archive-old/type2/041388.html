Subject: oil pump gasket?

Starting to put my engine back together tonight checking
with the a few books to make sure I do every thing right along
the way. In one book they talked about a oil pump gasket on a type4.
So I'll get to the point I didnt know there was one and
never ordered one, can I just use permatex 3H and no
gasket?

Alex, 77 Rivera w/79 engine
