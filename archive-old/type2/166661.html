Subject: Re: Was: Its Friday, that must mean I can post this....WRONG,
  Now: Brake backing plate 

Sorry Billy, I should have also stated that I was getting my bus back from the
mechanic today, after replacing the brake system. Replaced the rotors,
calipers, drums, cylinders, pads, shoes, fluid and lines. Master cylinder and
booster checked out fine. I just took her out for a spin, first time with new
Hankook RA8's all around, new brakes, and all lights sorted out. It felt really
good to have her back, and she handles MUCH better than she ever did. More like
a car, rather than a tractor ;) One &quot;funny&quot; side note, my mechanic said he
noticed a rattling in one of the &quot;accordian&quot; tubes, I pulled it off, and a
mouse nest and a handfull of cracked acorns fell out and onto the shop floor.
Seems I have some more work to do on the heat system....

One thing the mechanic found while replacing the rear drums/shoes/cylinders,
the drivers side brake (LHD) backing plate had the usual holes for the Shoe
retaning pin, and the passenger side didnt have any holes for the Shoe
retaining pin whatsoever. He assured me that the brakes would function normally
without the retaining pins on one side, and he even hoisted it up so I could
get some pics of it;

circle indicates area where pin is absent

So my question is; Is this a backing plate from another VW (bug, ghia, ?) that
dosent belong on my '74 Westy, or is this &quot;normal&quot;, or is it the case that I
have to replace the Brake backing plate? They both look pretty crusty, but the
metal is all good, with no major rust, just surface rust.
