Subject: Fw: [T2] [Q] Restoring Daily Driver

Howard is completly right..
.
Mine is an European (Portuguese) experience...maybe even third world...
Fortunately the father of my girlfriend has a good knowledge of working with 
metal, so he helped me in one of the most expensive part of a restauration.
This was in fact a great help...It cost almost nothing (less than 100 Euro).
The worse part was in fact painting it....(this is the third world part). It 
was always for tomorrow or for &quot;next friday&quot;...It tooked 4 months to paint 
it...and it's not all painted yet, It needs to be repainted in some 
places...
Till now i've spent a small fortune:

- metal work - priceless (0 Euro)
- seals - 500 Euro
- paint - 1250 Euro
Other parts (justkampers_dot_com, thesamba, bustedbus...) - 1000 Euro

You can see it (if interested) at: 
http://forum.autohoje_dot_com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=29986&amp;whichpage=5  (bottom 
page) and next...although the page is in portuguese, you can see the 
pictures..

And it's far, far from finish....

&gt; David,
&gt;
&gt;   When estimating the length of time and amount of cost for a restoration
&gt;you need to...................
&gt;1) Make your estimate of the time involved, and triple it.
&gt;2) Make your estimate of the cost involved, and quadruple it.
&gt;3) Realize that your UPS shipping bill will be three times more than the
 (....)
