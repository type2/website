Interesting question. I found an 86 Vanagon sitting for sale a couple of
years ago. I took it for a test drive and, what a clattering racket from the
collapsed lifters! But, it had a rebuilt engine from Volkswagen Canada in
it. The PO had meticulously changed the oil with synthetic oil. Told an old
time VW shop about it, and he said, synthetic oil will not pump up VW
hydraulic lifters, they will collapse. I took a chance and bought it with a
lowball offer. Changed the oil to dino 20W50, what a change, purred like a
kitten. It had an ace motor. Watch out for synthetic oils in VW's in my
limited experience. Let me know if this helps. Tom

&gt; I did an oil change about a hundred miles ago and switched to Castrol
&gt; synthetic/dino blend oil. Could that have any effect on the hydraulic
&gt; lifters?
