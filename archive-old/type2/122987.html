Subject: correct coil for pertronix?

i am considering ordering the Pertronix unit.  however, per aircooled_dot_net:

&quot;...You MUST make sure your ignition coil has the ballast resistor. Stock
Bosch blue coils have the 3 ohm ballast resistor INSIDE the coil. If your
coil or primary ignition winding doesn't have this ballast, the pertronix or
compufire in the distributor will BURN UP and leave you walking. There are 5
different &quot;Bosch Blue Coils&quot;, and only one of them has the ballast in it...&quot;

so...how can i tell if i already have the correct coil in the vehicle? i do
have the Bosch Blue'. i'm assuming it is the stock one mentioned above, but
how can i be sure?

TIA,
