Subject: Re: [T2] Turn signal switch

Mike,

No problem on the nice and level&lt;grin&gt;...yes, I have 5 vw's and every one
of them has a fire extinguisher in it....and a large one in the garage.

I didn't always have that many vw's(lucky to have just one) and I have
had 2 fires in a 67 bus...first one was because the brass connector
at the carb fell out and the other was because a rod went thru the 
top of the case at about 4,000 rpm.  I managed to &quot;blow&quot;(yeah,stupid)
both of the fires out and not burn anything but spark plug wires.

Had a buddy that worked on a bus he was going to sell at the Eureka
show a couple of years ago that burned it to the ground on the way over.

He has fire extinguishers in all his vehicles, but missed that one cause 
he was on his way to sell it....

Believe me, I know about shoestrings(and worse).

Cheers, dave

&gt; You're yelling at the &quot;Paranoid Safety Guy&quot;.  Don't.  Speak politely in a
&gt; level voice.
&gt; 
&gt; I have paid attention.  I'm also building a business on a shoestring budget
&gt; and can't always set aside the bucks to fix and repair the bus, even when it
&gt; only involves a few dollars.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is why I'm glad that the fuel pump went out yesterday.  It was a good
&gt; excuse to do the fuel line thing.  Without the FI, and having a single carb,
&gt; there was very little to replace.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You might as well add a *good* fire extinguisher to your list of needed
&gt; parts as well.
&gt; 
&gt; You don't have one?  I thought that every good driver carried a fire
&gt; extinguisher.  And a first aid kit.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Glad that you didn't burn, dave
&gt; 
&gt; Us, too. :O)
