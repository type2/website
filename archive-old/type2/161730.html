Subject: RE: [T2] Junk Yard experiences (long and boring, but it IS
  Friday)

&gt;From: Anymouse &lt;honeybus_at_gmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt;I have contacted at least nine of these POs to ask about their VW bus, and
&gt;why it was in the yard, and what was the reason the VW was discarded.


I've done this many times as well.  Best way to find out what parts are good 
vs. bad. :)  Sure comes in handy when deciding whetehr to pull an engines 
from the u-pull-it places.
