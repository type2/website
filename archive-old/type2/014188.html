Subject: Re: [T2] New to list.



&gt; Hi all, I am new to the list and thought I should make myself known. My name is Paul Shurvell, and I live in Darwin in the Northern 
Territory, Australia. I am currently in the process of buying my first T2 bus, a 1974 camper. This will be my first aircooled VW (I have 
owned a '79 Golf GLD in the past), The bus is in Brisbane, and I fly out on Monday to go and pick it up. What I would like to know is what 
sort of spares should I carry for the trip (3500km, what is likely to go wrong, and what I should check before I leave? The engine has been 
rebuilt within the last 2 years by a prominent Brisbane WV mechanic so it should be ok, however, I can't say as much for the rest of it. 
Another thing I would like to know is how do I tell what capacity the engine is just by looking at it (is it stamped somewhere?). I know that 
this is prety basic stuff and has probably been covered on the list a hundred times, but as I am new to this I hope you will all induge me!
&gt; Regards to all, Paul Shurvell.

Well, it all depends upon how readily parts are available by parcel in OZ, and how much time you are willing to wait to get back on the 
road if you break.  A partial list of stuff to carry would include:

Front and rear wheel bearings
CV joint and boot
Carburator, complete
Distributor, complete
Coil
Generator brushes
voltage regulator
Fuel pump
2 spare tires.
small floor jack
Socket for 46mm nuts.
Brake pads and shoes
throttle cable
clutch cable
asperin
a good book.

I'm sure that there is more and others will fill it in.  Nothing is better than the feeling of breaking something and having a replacement 
available from your parts box.
