Subject: heater fans
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Well my inline heater fan was making real bad noises so I
bought a new one ($25.00. The original one lasted about 3
or 4 years. I made some &quot;improvements&quot; on this
installation.
**First I installed the fan in the ABS adaptor flanges. I
used the rope looking stove gasket material and glued it in
around the small gap where the fan interfaces with the
adaptor.
**Second, I wrapped it with rubber from a old inner tube
and used zipties to hold it on the fan body. 
**Third I cut new &quot;adaptor&quot; metal sheeting to seal and
reinforce the interface between the ABS pipe and the
original fittings on the bus.
**fourth.  The pipe/fan assembly runs right under the shift
linkage tube. I used zipties (not tooo tight) at several
spots along the run up to the shift linkage tube to help
support.
  I have read about people having problems with fumes and
such. All I can say is I have had no problem with the ABS
black sewer pipe. I am aware of how PVC pipe, however, is
not good at elevated temps...
My first installation I wrapped the ABS pipe with
insulation... not a good idea. it sagged a bit. Without
insulation the present ABS pipe has been in place for over
three years now with no deformation.
  I use the exsisting relay in the engine compartment which
is activated by the heat control lever on the dash to turn
the fan on. I suppose if your beast doesnt have that
arrangement you could install a switch up front to activate
a 12 vdc relay to turn the fan on an off.... the fan does
draw a bit of current so insure your relay is rated to
handle the fan.... oh yeah... in line fuse in the supply
line should be installed before the relay... that will
protect the whole system. Mine is up in the engine
compartment.
  All this being said. I live in Seattle which doesnt get
Northern Michigan cold or south Texas hot.
I have a drawing on my site... kind of a schematic type
dwg. Good luck an stay warm!

  Oh yeah! the rubber (inner tube) wrap makes it MUCH
quieter!

My dog is usually pleased with what I do, 
because he is not infected with the concept of what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.
