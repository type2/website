Hi john,

That is because gex has been discussed over and over and over and over ad
nauseum, perhaps you should go to www.type2_dot_com and search the archives
for GEX.  That shoud net you HUNDREDS of messages.  If you still have
questions after that i am sure there will be plenty of help here...

take care,

Steve
