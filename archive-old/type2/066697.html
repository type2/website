Subject: PROPEX Furnaces: Group Purchase?

Sorry, there has not been consistent cross-posting to 
Type2 from Vanagon on this:

PROPEX is a UK firm which makes a propane furnace which
has been sucessfully installed in VW buses/campers. It fits
under the rear seat, and is small, 14x6x4.5&quot;. Fully vented,
no cutting of body metal required, though you do have to put
to smallish holes in the floor for intake and exhaust. 
Cost of one unit, with duties, shipping and general
grief, approaches $600. 

For details, reviews, thoughts and installation instructions, 
go to Gerry's vanagon archive and search '96 for &quot;PROPEX&quot;:
http://halfdan.med.umn_dot_edu:8853/misc/archives/vanagon.html

Anyway, I will inquire about group discounts before ordering one
for myself. If this is of interest to you, please e-mail
me direct.

Thanks

Tom F.
