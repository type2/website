Subject: Re: finding dropped valve seat

&gt; Has anyone else noticed this stem difference in the factory 1600 heads
&gt; and/or have an explanation for it?

I just realized one possibility is that either the intake or exhaust
valves, or simply their retainer groove locations, aren't truly OEM.
That's something I should've measured at the time I had the heads apart
for cleaning and lapping.   A local mechanic I've recently spoken with did
mention that he buys his new 1600 DP heads bare and installs TRW
valves--apparently he had one bad experience with stretching exhaust
valves and decided not to take a chance using the same on his subsequent
engine builds.
