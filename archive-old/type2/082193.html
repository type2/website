&lt;&lt;  Does anyone have a suggestion for the best products/procedure to use when 
painting engine tin.
&gt; I plan to do this job myself, while my mechanic is installing my new 
engine, exhaust and heater boxes.
&gt; Thanks for the help. &gt;&gt;

Most any brand name spray paint would work - follow directions, etc. The
real secret is cleaning the tin religiously so no grease or oil is left to 
lift
the paint after it's installed...
