&gt; High road?  Low road?  I say go whichever way you like, but make sure you're

&gt; My strategy for steep uphill grades is simple: never push it.  On a 3rd-gear
&gt; hill, my Bus can do 45, but 40 takes a lot less throttle and is much easier on
&gt; the engine.  On a 2nd-gear hill it will do 30, but I never push it past 25.

well one of the nice things about an auto tranny, you don't lug it, it
downshifts.   it tells you when it wants more RPMs
