Subject: Camping Stool Needed

Hi Folks, I need the camping stool, that fits between the front seats, for a 
' 78 Westy. The green plaid would be nice, but I'll take anything, as long as 
it's in good shape. Please, if you've got one that you want to sell, p-mail 
me and I'll send you a money order(including shipping to NC).
Thanks,
Parker,( who has a Really Short wife, who really likes to sleep on the top 
bunk!)
