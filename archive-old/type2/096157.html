&gt; &gt;&gt;Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71

&gt; right tire it's just a matter of what width..
&gt; There are 185's on the bus
&gt; now...Thoughts , draw backs ????

well for a little more stability and better (IMO) handling you could use
205/70R14 tires...they are almost identical in outside diameter to the
stock 185/14 tires that are stock.

if looks and originality are more important then stick to the 185s

weight rating is VERY critical
