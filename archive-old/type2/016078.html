I correct the technical problem with the archives.  PLEASE let Steve or I
(Stephen) know when there is a problem :)

  Archives:  http://vw.i405_dot_com/

The archives are out of date about 7 months, but there is still 4 years of
good old info (GOI) to search :)  My new engine trouble install and a
pending 5,000 mile trip is keeping me away from the home PC :)
