You are right, the purpose of the fuel filler neck and the &quot;bird beak&quot; is to
keep you or someone else from inadvertently putting leaded gas in your tank.
Especially for those vehicles that came with a catalytic converter, which
leaded gas will totally destroy.  So, if you're wondering why the bird beak is
there, now you know.  But be careful about cutting it out.  To pass emissions,
some states require that cars equipped with a catalytic converter have a
restrictor plate (or &quot;bird beak&quot; in the case of our beloved VW's) and test for
this.  In short, if the larger diameter leaded nozzle fits in the fuel filler,
no emissions certification for you.  BTW, there are other ways around the
emissions problem without a bird beak, just use your imagination...

&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know exactly what this bird beak in the filler neck is for?
&gt; Whatever the reason, it ain't worth it!  If you got one, cut it off!
