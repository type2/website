Hey folks, this one fresh off the rec.autos.makers.volkswagen.aircooled
newsgroup. Someone ought to jump on this. Call him, not me. This is all
I know.

FS: 71 Campmobile real cheap

This is the non-pop-top version.  Has all the seats, cabinents,
cooler/sink, and several screens.  The engine is locked up, but I think
it's original.  Would be good as a parts car or a restoration.  ONLY
$200!   You can write, come by or call the stuff below or leave a message
at 910-230-0923.  Thanks Jae.
