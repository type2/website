	Mark,
	If you can draw a real vaccuum using &quot;one of those pumps that fits 
on a drill chuck (8.95)&quot; I'd be VERY interested in where you got it!

The only drill-chuck pumps I'm aware of pump water at low-ish pressure, 1-2psi?
The problem when bleeding brakes is pumping air at moderate pressure ~10psi
OF course you could invest in a LARGE quantity of brake fluid and pump
THAT using the drill-chuck pump... it would lack the finesse of the
little hand-squeeze pump but given enough brake fluid (gallon or two)
and a sealable containter and a catch-container you COULD create a 
useful vaccuum in the sealed container... But you'd have spend $40 on
the brake fluid alone.

	$25-$39 seems to be list price for the cheapest of the little hand 
vaccuum pumps. Once you've got the vaccuum pump, you can make a nice 
sealed resevior much bigger than the pump people supply from a jar or 
bottle with an input hose to connect to the brake nipple and an outlet hose
to connect to the pump. You'll need RTV to seal the clear hose or
matching-size brass hose to solder to the jelly-jar lid. Just hose and
a jar aren't enough- you need to keep the surrounding air out of
the low pressure you're paying money to create.

	The cheapest hand-held vaccuum pumps are expensive and a good one
is probably a bit more. Consider that 15lb/square inch means that a square
inch of piston area requires 15lb effort and 2 square inches requires 30lb-
now remember what a 30lb free wieght looks like. Uhuh. You want your
little hand-held vaccuum pump to be built TOUGH.

	Of course I could be wrong here- anyone have good results using
an electric drill pump to draw vaccuum on a hydraulic system?

	Bill
