&gt;hey folks, does anyone know what is the correct color of the trim for my 
&gt;side markers on my 79 camper?  It's the plain camper with ice box and

&gt;hatch and engine lid buttons are black.  The only 2 remaining side markers 
&gt;on the camper are the rear ones and they both have silver trim.  I'm taking 
&gt;it to the body shop tomorrow and want to order the correct lenses (black or 
&gt;silver)  TIA, Greg

Black trim. I'm not sure when it changed from silver to black: perhaps 76-79.
