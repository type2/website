A friend has just acquired a VW oil sump heater as part of a stash of bits
and pieces he salvaged.

It's cast aluminum, with a steel extension on the side where the 110V power
cord attaches.  It appears to be identical to the heater pictured in an
article in the July 2000 Hot VWs magazine.

Cast into the circumference of the heating element is the following:


    FIVE STAR MFG. CO. ... CLARKSDALE, MISS ... KAT'S ENGINE HEATER ...
MODEL NO. VW-15 ...
    W-150 ... V-120


We assume &quot;W-150&quot; refers to 150 watts, which is not a lot of heat.  And that
&quot;V-120&quot; refers to the voltage
[it has a standard 2-prong plug, like one would find on an inexpensive
toaster].

Is anyone familiar with this item, particularly with it's functional
effectiveness?  If it is an effective heater it would be placed into service
this winter.

Any idea of it's value?  If it's &quot;priceless&quot; the owner will probably rethink
installing it on an engine :)
