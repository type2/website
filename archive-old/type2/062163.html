Subject: Border crossings

Listening to some of the Inuvikers experiences at the Canadian border
reminded me of my often uncomfortable experiences when I lived in Detroit 15
years ago and crossed into Canada. More specifically I should say when I
crossed back into the US since I found the canuck gendarmes to be unfailingly
courteous while the US version were typically pluperfect pricks.

Now when entering another country I am of the opinion that they can turn me
upside down naked if they wish since it is their country and they make the
rules. What I don't understand is how the Bill of Rights and due process etc
can be completely suspended for US citizens entering their own country. What
principle of law is at work here?
