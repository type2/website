&gt;&gt; The sink in my bus doesn't work.  I'm assuming it is an electric pump because from what I can see (&amp;  it's not much) there is a blue cylindrical &quot;something&quot; with wires coming out of it.  Can someone please explain to me (as if I was a 12 year old) how the whole mechanism works, any diagrams, etc&gt;&gt;

&gt;Lori,

&gt;You don't say what year Bus you have.
Sorry, 1975

  Some used electric pumps and some
&gt;used hand pumps.  &gt;
&gt;If you indeed have an electric pump, it's a pretty simple circuit. 
&gt;There is a power line to the pump with fuse, and the ground wire runs
&gt;&gt;from the pump through a switch on to a ground.  Usually the switch is at
&gt;the faucet so when you turn the faucet, you make the ground connection
&gt;and the pump springs to life.  

Forgive me but I don't understand grounds, volts, etc. (yikes, I know) maybe someone can point me in the direction of some reading material that explains this (generalized) with respect to cars, then I can ask some good/appropriate questions?  Anything on-line?

With the help of my 13y.o. foster son, we were able to figure out the &quot;T&quot; switch to stop water from flowing out the bottom.  filled the tank with about 11/2 gallons of water &amp; it stayed (Yea!) The little round switch next to the faucet turns click click click (both ways) &amp; nothing happens.  Is it left for on or right? Does the ignition key need to be turned on when trying to use the pump? (tried it &amp; still didn't work).

Does the wiring go to the dash with the other electrical, or does it go to the bus battery?  Is the fuse in with the other fuses on the dash as well?


The pump should run on 12v and not on
&gt;shore power.  My only electric pump experience was on an '81 Westy and
&gt;the '81 had an additional element to the circuit:  there was a water
&gt;level sensor inside the water tank and the pump would not activate
&gt;unless the water level was above a certain point and the toggle switch
&gt;on the sink cabinet (by the battery and water level meters) was turned
&gt;to the on position.  If you have an older Bus, yours might not have this
&gt;circuitry.


I don't think I do!
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps, Lori.
