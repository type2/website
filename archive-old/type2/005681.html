Having a similar problem with my 71.  I tried to access this article.  I
could find the title in the list, but cannot open it. Am I doing something
wrong, or does anyone have a copy they can pmail me?

My 71 was doing the same thing on the way to Texas, must be a state problem
;)

I checked valves, timing, tin, spark plug seals, thermostat all ok and
still hot.  Found Barb and Eric's carb tuning procedure in the library and
I am now at least 30 degrees cooler.  Had to pick up a tach/dwell meter but
I am running awesome now and more importantly COOL!!!

Thanks Barb and Eric for the great procedure!

Happy Memorial Day to all.
