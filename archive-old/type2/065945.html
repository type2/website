For greasing rubber parts, there have been several &quot;halocarbon&quot; greases
as well as some silicone greases for this for some time.  I use a Dow
Molycote grease (I think it's Molycote 111, but it's at home an' I ain't).
This stuff works *great*, and a little goes a long way.

Despite it having a &quot;molycote&quot; name, this stuff is a clear gel, no oil
to deteriorate the rubber, and no molybdenum disulfate to get your hands
dirty.  Like all greases (and unlike graphites and spray silicones) this will
attract dirt, so you have a maintenence item where before you didn't.

The greases can be found as &quot;o-ring&quot; grease sometimes, in itty-bitty tubes.
My tube of the Moly stuff is about a 1 lb. tube, picked up several years ago
for 50 cents at a yard sale.  My wife thought I was nuts to buy it...
