&gt;A friend of mine as a Westy tent he asked me to sell for him.
&gt;He asked me what it is worth, and I am  really not sure, so it is open
&gt;for an offer.

Price will also depend on what model of tent it is.  &quot;Westy Tent&quot; includes a lot of different tent styles, and many people mistakenly say &quot;Westy Tent&quot; when the tent is not a 
Westfalia tent at all -- just as many people think every VW bus camper is a &quot;Westy&quot;.  That disturbs Mr. Language Nazi almost as much as the posts that say &quot;Westy 
question&quot; when they're just asking about generic bus stuff, or the ones that refer to &quot;ragtops&quot; when they're not referring to convertibles.

But I digress.

You can find the style on my tent pages (see .sig below) -- if it isn't there, I'd love to see some pix.
