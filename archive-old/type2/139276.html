Subject: [T2] fuel-pump cut-out alternative (update)

I asked a few days ago about wiring a substitute fuel pump cutout, 
since my pump ran anytime the ignition was on.  In the end, I decided 
to pop the top off of the intake air sensor and try to fix the circuit. 
  Sure enough, the moving lever of the switch was bent such that it 
wasn't being pushed open by the closed flap assembly.  A little careful 
bending the other way, and it now functions properly.  I resealed the 
top, and I think we're back to spec!

Thanks for all the advice.  I can't remember who suggested bending the 
switch arm, but thank you!

cheers,
