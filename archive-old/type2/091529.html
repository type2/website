&gt; Hello,

&gt; If using penatrating spray, I recoment PB Blaster. For
&gt; me it seems to work much better than WD-40. I used it
&gt; to free my froze exhaust nuts and it worked
&gt; wonderfully. Just my $0.02 worth. Good Luck!!!

I'd expect it to work better, because WD-40 isn't a penetrating oil.  It's
a light petroleum oil/kerosene mixture intended for driving water away
(&quot;WD&quot; means &quot;Water Dispersant&quot;)

Another brand of penetrating oil that some swear by is Kroil.  I like the
stuff, but it's hard to find.
