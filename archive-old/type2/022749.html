X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Paul, we just purchased the Bridgestone 603V a couple of months ago.  They ride very well on the highway &amp; around town. Haven't tried them off-road just yet.  I think the tirer*ck price was $64.00 each + shipping &amp; about $100 to have them mounted/balanced locally. I would definitely recommend that tire.
