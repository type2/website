&gt; &gt; The adaptor bracket bolts to the Stock oil pump cover plate and one

&gt; &gt; have to lengthen the oil pump cover studs.
&gt; Since he has the mounting bosses on the case, all he has to do is to
&gt; drill and tap them for the rear mount bar.  No sense doing a
&gt; Mickey-Mouse installation when a few bucks worth of tools will do it
&gt; the right way.  The tools would probably cost less than the &quot;adapter&quot;.
&gt;  Also, if the bosses are present, they will probably interfere with
&gt; the adapter.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps, but I'm relating my experience, and the adaptor plate has
always 
&gt; worked
&gt; fine for me. I don't consider it 'mickey mouse' and maybe it's an
easier 
&gt; option for 
&gt; someone who just wants to get down the road. 

Perhaps my words were a bit strong here.  Some folks have had good
luck with the oil-pump adapters, particularly the adapters that also
attach to the case bolts lower down.  This additional attach point is
important because the rear mount takes all the torsional loads from
the engine, as the front mount twists without much resistance.

However, if the case already has the bosses cast in, I doubt that the
adapter will fit over them.  In this case, the obvious solution is to
drill and tap the bosses for use as originally intended.
