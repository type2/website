David,
Since it sat for 10 years, I would first replace *all* the fuel lines.
Really.
Of course, drain the old fuel and fill your tank with a couple of gallons of
fresh stuff. (I'd avoid messing with the little gas can, which is tedious,
messy, and potentially hazardous--if you don't mind me saying so :)

Also, how come the fuel pump is running if the engine isn't? Normally, it
will only run while the starter is cranking or while the engine is running.
Next measure the fuel pressure and we can then take it from there. I assume
you have already checked all vacuum hoses for cracks and made sure you have
positive contact at all electrical connectors.

Check the type2 library's fuel section. Sean Bartnik has a nice guide to FI
there.

Good luck,

Sami
