Subject: Re: [T2] Awning for 1972 Westy

I've got a 11 or 12 foot one on my '76 westy and I love it.  The only
problem is with the brackets, the pop top hits on the nuts on the back of
the brackets.  I am redesigning these now, but don't have them done.  Really
a nice awning and gives lots of shade.  It may cost a bit, but it is easy to
set up and store and is much more durable in the wind than a tarp and poles.
Looks good folded up, makes the westy look like it's got a side winder
missle on the side!!
