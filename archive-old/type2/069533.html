Midas Muffler in Hamburg, NY did a custom exhaust for my friend's '77.  =
They ran pipe right off the heads and sent it towards the front of the =
bus.  This was capped off with two glasspacks with outlets that angled =
out the side.  They had quite a run on the straight pipe (the tips were =
almost behond the front wheelwells), but it sounded pretty good, was =
guaranteed for life, and cost him a whopping $120 for everything.  =
Alternatively, if you're into welding, I've heard you can modify an S&amp;S =
header from a Bug to fit the pancake motor, although I would need to =
research this a bit further to see what gets modified and how.  Hope =
this helps!

I'm tired of paying 300 per side for heater boxes on my 78 Westy for =

heat in return. I've got a gas heater anyway. Has anyone =
seen/heard/have/know
of a company that is selling or manufacturing J-tubes to replace the =
boxes?
I would LOVE to get my hands on such a pair of critters.
Thanks!=20
