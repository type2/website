Subject: Toot, toot !  (horn) 

Found an 'original' horn (made in France?) in a
junk yard.  Took it home and cleaned it up.

Replaced my non stock horn with this junk yard
special.  Did a host of other things.

'New' horn would not toot.  IN FACT, with the
steering wheel off, and pressing the exposed horn
ring, there was a noticeable dimming of my dome
light, accompanied by a blue light (blue flash;
BIG blue spark) originating somewhere down my
exposed steering column.

Well, I re-replaced the horn with the non stock,
and everything was fine.

Now, realize, I had just spent upwards of 2-3
loving hours to get this junk yard horn so clean
and shinny that . . . , and not about to give up
on it.

In the front-center of the junk yard horn is a
small plastic cap.  I carefully pried this cap
off, which revealed a small nut with a slotted
screw in the center of the nut.  Don't know what
possessed me, but I did a turn or two of the screw
and reconnected the junk yard horn.

Noise!!  real noise, and no blue spark or dimming
of my overhead light.

Now, after much trying, I found that I could
adjust the PITCH of the horn by turning the screw.
And there is only a slight (less than one
revolution) of the screw before it is too low or
too high.

At the real low pitch, the horn seems less loud.
At the real high pitch, it sounds effeminate.  So
I selected the 'sitting tall, and driving proud,
and get outta my way all squirrels and low flying
geese' sound.
