Subject: Sliding door track lube question

Took the cover off to get the rear latch off the track to slip the new seal in
for the sliding door w/o taking the door off.... Mission accomplished this
morning.... Thanks to Richards #37 Sliding Door Tech Article!

the sliding door works great but I did noticed after cleaning on the dust out
of the track there was no lube at all. Should this be lubed? Ratwell mentions
lubing the track in his article but the door slides so easy...

Thanks,
Trey
