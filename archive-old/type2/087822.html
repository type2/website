Volks,
Strangest thing happened on the way home from work.  5:15PM, cruising along
405, 65 mph, right before the 55 split, wierd sound from the back, turn off
the radio, serious screeching going on back there!

I looked down to see the 'GEN' light starting to flicker, then stay on
solidly.  Quickly turned it off, pulled  it off the freeway coasting, get it
to the side, and start the horrid mental pictures in my head.  Pop the lid,
look down, and realize the belt is practically melted off the pulley.  The
rearmost part of the alternator pulley has gone for a chow on the
alternator, and embedded itself into the housing!

Once I got some wrenches in there, I found the rear part of the pulley was
cracked all the way around, from cutout to cutout, spun right into the
housing, and took 3 out of 5 front shaft supports to Valhalla with it.

So, has anyone ever done this?  Can I get the front part, or do I need to
get a whole new alternator?

Later,

Simon Ramirez
