Subject: Re: [T2] timing the SVDA

&gt; What year engine do you have?  Is it stock?  Check the code on your
&gt; engine and verify with the bentley manual as to what you want your
&gt; timing set at for your engine.  I believe you want to set your timing
&gt; according to your engine model, not your distributor type.  Hopefully
&gt; someone else can confirm this.

well steve dolan the acknowledged master of the timing swears by setting
the timing based on the distributor type and not the engine
