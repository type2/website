Subject: Re: Engine Compartment Seal

Hey there, Beth.  Congrats on doing it yourself.  Feels good, huh????

Anyway, I didn't notice who or when you got instructions for installing the 
engine compartment seal.  If you still have them, I'd appreciate you 
forwarding them on to me.  I just ordered mine...

Take care and peace!!
