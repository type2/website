speaking from experience, long hair and a bus (that's me)
used to get you the &quot;royal&quot; treatment when disembarking from
the Bar Harbor (Maine) &lt;--&gt; Yarmouth (Nova Scotia) ferry; 
budget: 12 hours passage + 3 hours search

kids did not think this funny as there was no place to pee
during the latter, circus phase
