Subject: Hello Intro

Hi Everyone,
 My name is Lisa and my husband bought me a 1978 bus 
about a month ago.  We really don't know too much 
about them, but I have always wanted one.  It was my 
birthday/mother's day present.  She needs some new cv 
joints and we are planning on replacing them as soon 
as we can.  The bus has been in some type of accident 
the previous owner didn't know what happened to it.  
We already bought the sideview mirrors, so as soon as 
the cv's have been replaced the kids and I can head to 
the beach and other places!  I am so excited!  We all 
are actually.  My bus is white but we want to repaint 
it eventually maybe a blue.  The man we bought it from 
was going to paint it like the Mystery Machine for his 
girls so he gave us the scooby doo curtains, but we 
need to get some rods.  LOL  We paid $700 for her, and 
like I said I think that once the cv joints are 
replaced we can drive it without having to worry too 
much.  Of course we will work on it each payday to get 
her in better condition!  Anyway, I am glad to be 
here.  
Lisa
