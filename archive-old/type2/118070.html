Subject: Re: [T2] Posting/ 4 wheel drive conversion

&lt;&lt; Congrats on the new westy. Converting it to 4 wheel drive would be a huge 
undertaking, however I have seen it done on a split window bus. They used 
the drive train and chasis from a 4 wheel drive truck and basicaly put the 
split window on top of that.

And following that thread to its best/worst conclusion (your decision ?-)
was the Datsun 4X4 pickup frame with a (o heart be still !) Gremlin body
sittin' on top...Purple, 'natch...
