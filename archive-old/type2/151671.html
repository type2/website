Subject: RE: [T2] Dual carb troubleshooting techniques needed

Ted,

Ummmm...I don't get it...how does this actually work?

Do you have to pinch off the tube to one side or the other to see the 
different carb settings?

This also assumes you have a balance tube....&lt;grin&gt;...not on my 48 idf's!

Cheers, dave

 Hi Volks-  a hint on sync's dual carbs (from MUD). Use monometer (a tool
 used to sync multiple carbs on motorcycles) connected to the balance tube
 between the carb's.  This will give you readings of both carbs at once,
&gt; without changing a carb syncing tool between carb's. Much easier and you can
&gt; check the balanced at higher RPM at the same time.  It works,  is much
&gt; easier and generally more accurate. TBear
