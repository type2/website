Subject: Goodbye am radio.

 Hello everyone.  We're waiting on some home improvements to finish before we can move into our new house and are currently staying in an apartment.  Woke up this morning to find that someone had broken in to the big green beastie and STOLEN our stereo.  (Wish I could've been there when they tried to hock it and discovered it was an original stock stereo from 1978 that only plays am/fm and has no resale value).  Anyway, they cut ALL of my wires and they are now too short to reconnect to anything.  Can I splice the wires?  If not, how do we redo the stereo wiring all the way to the back of the bus?  We've never done any wiring work before.  Best left to a pro?
 
Josh and Emma in SC
