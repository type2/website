Subject: [T2] valves adjustment 1978/2liter westy 

&gt;hi everybody can anybody tel me if a aircooled
ingene van een 1978 t2b 2liter duble 
caburator had manual or hydralic valve adjustment
, and what are the right 
clearences for this valves , are they sodium
filled ore normal ,

US spec vans came w/ hydraulic and FI.  Perhaps
you have a different spec van, or add on carbs. 
European spec vans had double solexes into the
80's.  Do you know what market you van was made
for?
