Subject: Re: [T2] gas mileage

Michael,
Stick with stock.  I am running a bone stock 1600 in my 71 Single cab and am
getting just over 21 mpg.  If I was getting the gas mileage you are, I might
have to reconsider driving a bus, and start driving a motorcycle with gas
prices rising over 10 cents a week here now.  :(

Good Luck on getting the MPG up to an acceptable level.

Snoopy
