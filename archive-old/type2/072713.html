I had over 50 listees respond to my request.  Thank You all!

      &quot;Have you had any problems with your FI system this year?&quot;

        YES (21)  NO (25)  Other comments (6)


       Temp Sensor #2  (7)   &quot;Intermittant Misfire, rough idle,  richness&quot;

        AFM (mostly contact plate) (7) &quot;Misfiring or cutout at a particular
range&quot;

       Aux Air Valve  (2) &quot;idle and starting problems&quot;

        Connector problems (4)  &quot;intermittant cut out and starting&quot;

        Cold Start (1)

        Fuel Pump (1)

        Double Relay (1)

        Altitude Switch Label (1) &quot;backwards&quot;  created richness problem

The fact that the temp sensor #2 was a trouble spot didn't surprise me but
I didn't expect to have this many AFM contact plate problems.  I guess 20
years of friction of the control arm swinging over the contact plate is
predictable to cause failure.  If you haven't found a good spare for the
AFM maybe its time to be putting away alittle to send to Bus Depot for a
new one ($150 up).

Notice that no one mentioned a problem with the ECU!

Karl von Salzen mentioned that he replaces his Temp sensor #2 every year
just as a matter of preventative maintenence.  Probably a smart thing.  I
personally would worry about stripping the threads on the head with this
much replacement so I'd recommend just testing the sensor regularly:

        Put ohm meter contact between #13 and #17 ground.  This tests the
        Temperature sensor II.  At 68 degrees it should be between
2000-2900 ohms.
        (700-1000 _at_122 degrees; 200-400 _at_ 176 degrees; and less than 200 at
        operating temp.)  Testing this at the Harness to ECU plug will test
        whether there is a problem in the harness too.


Almost without exception, everyone voiced satisfaction with their Bosch FI
System.  With a simple multi meter test most problems can be easily
diagnosed and corrected.

Have fun and may the wind always be at your back,
