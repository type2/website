Subject: Re: [T2] Share your original paperwork...

Hello all
I have two 68 buses in restorable shape that are
identical and thinking of selling them, but on one of
them I have the original window sticker in really good
shape. I dont have a scan of it but can get one and
post.........i thought it was really neat......I have
a 1974 beetle that I bought from the original
owner....which was cool cause i have copies of the
original title and such paperwork.....things like this
really interest me also.

&gt; I posted mine on TheSamba, but was curious: How many
&gt; of you still have
&gt; original paperwork, manuals, etc for your busses?
&gt; 
&gt; I have the original delivery invoice showing
&gt; shipping from the factory to
&gt; Frankfurt and original paint codes, options, etc.
