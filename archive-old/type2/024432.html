Monica:

Some checking info from your VW bus-driving banker. If I understand, the 
mechanic called to tell you your 2nd check bounced. The check laws vary from 
state to state, but all he has to do is call your bank 2 or 3 times a week 
too find out when you make another deposit and then run into your bank to 
cash the check. That's going to
tie up your checking account until you get it settled.

To avoid this, you would need to close the checking account, and the bank is
going to ask you &quot;Are all your checks cleared?&quot; and if you say yes knowing you
have a check outstanding, you could get into some legal hot water. Once a 
check
has been presented for payment, I don't think you can place a stop payment on 
it.

Finally, most states have a mechanic's lien law which protects auto shops, 
even the
bad ones, from people not paying their bill. For $1,400 it is worth his 
trouble and he
can place a lien on your car for that amount and cause you some trouble.

I think, since you have already blown this money, that you might consider 
asking
the mechanic to make good on his rebuild.  It usually helps to drop the hint 
that
you really don't want to have to contact the BBB (Better Business Bureau) but 
if forced to you would have no choice. If your mechanic's business gets a 
number of BBB complaints, it can come back to haunt your him. You could try a 
lawyer, but
$1,400 won't get you past most of their reception desks.
