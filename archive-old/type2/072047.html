Subject: hard2find seals

on the 1600, there are 2 seals behind each rocker. seems the brazilians
have negated the use of them in new engines, so i can't get these gaskets
locally either separately one-off or in a gasket set. does anybody have a
friendly source for these, or spares for me?
thank ya
