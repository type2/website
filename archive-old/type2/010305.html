Hello All --
I recently had an electrical problem which resulted in the replacement of
my alternator (rebuilt) and voltage regulator (new).  Afterward, I noticed
that my idle was much higher than it used to be.  I don't have a tach and
am therefore unsure of the exact RPMs, but I know that before it was
quietly bubbling along and now it is much faster (&amp; even sometimes erratic)
and much more noticeable; I picked up on it right away.  I've done a
general survey of my vacuum hoses and such, finding no apparent
leaks/disconnections.  I plan to dig a little deeper into the vacuum
plumbing today; will also test the decel valve, aux. air regulator, etc.
hoping to find the obvious answer.  However, I'm curious:  could an
electrical problem (or the repair of an electrical problem, in my case)
cause a change in idle speed like this?  I'm just wondering if the idle
might have been too low to begin with and now it is merely where it should
be after getting the aforementioned electrical stuff fixed.  Any further
diagnostic ideas on a high idle are quite welcome as well.  Thanks in
advance for your responses &amp; ideas.
