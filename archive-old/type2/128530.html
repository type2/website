Subject: Re: [T2] More tire questions, winter, all season vs. C/D

I have driven vehicles with the &quot;summer tires&quot;. They are very tough tires but scary on anything but dry roads. If you can afford them, buy all season tires. 

LOTS more 15 inch options. I see many sets of Mercedes wheels on the auction sites for $100-$200 range, some with good tires. There is 1 set on an auction site now with good tires for $125 tires and wheels. 

Look at the Mercedes enthusiast sites and see if you think the Mercedes weighs similar weights as our old VW buses. Especially look at their station wagon. In other words I'm not going to make a technical statement of fact here but  - - - if the weight of the Mercedes = VW Transporter then the wheels ought to be strong enough - right? I'm seeing 2000 kg for the big ones, and 1400 kg for the smaller ones = 3000 - 4400 lbs for a Mercedes empty. As I recall the late 80's Wagon had a larger cargo weight capacity than the Jeep Wagoneer (?).

As I recall you want wheels that will fit the W126 cars. 

You'll have to have the center of the wheel machined out slightly to fit the VW hub. Mine won't slip all the way on without this. That's next on my list. I have a set of BBS wheels that were sold for the Mercedes. If you are buying aftermarket wheels consider that there are MANY aftermarket suppliers but only a few the OEMs will use. In my research I found several wheels that might look similar (copies of a better wheel) but the cheaper ones often had lower strength alloys. I have spotted my wheels on Lincoln Continentals too (BBS was an OEM to Ford I believe( and that is certainly a heavy car...
