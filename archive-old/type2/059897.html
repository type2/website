Subject: Re: 82: Oil leak between #1/2 cyl/case

A leak appearing to come from cyl/case connection *might* also be a leaky
rear seal blowing oil into the air path- this is happening on my '78,
though more on the left side......take it to a car wash with the lower tin
removed and blast it with the detergent &quot;engine cleaning&quot; spray, followed
by rinse- then watch where oil first comes from.  I thought it was also
leaking due to a loose head, but retorqued the lower nuts, and could see
that leak came from above and ran down where you see it.
   A louder noise not traced to a heater box/muffler connection could be
from where the exhaust manifold connects to the head- you'd see if it's
black around there.   Remember that no oil should be in the cylinder, only
below it....
