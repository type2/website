Subject: Fw: [T2] '74 wiring harness



&gt; ----- Original Message -----
&gt; From: Bob &lt;rgreenup3_at_home_dot_com&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I said:
&gt;
&gt; If you want new wiring, why grab a junker harness that could have as many
&gt; flaws as your old one if you're willing to spend for new anyway?
&gt; You could spend the effort to compare the 72 and 74 wiring diagrams and
&gt; find the differences, adding a few cables here or there to the 72. They
&gt; can't
&gt; be terribly different for those years, both carbed, both bays, etc...
&gt;
&gt; Bob said:
&gt;
&gt; Good idea--Other than the fuse block being in a diffrent place, and the
smog
&gt; pump on the 74.  What other diffrences are there, Bill?
&gt;
&gt; My advice comes from working in an electrical engineers office, where we
&gt; know that once wiring has been in place for a number of years, you can't
&gt; expect to yank it, tug on it, bend it, shape it, and shove it somewhere
else
&gt; without likely damage.
&gt;
&gt; Sure, grab a relay or a starter at a junker, if it doesn't work, whatever.
&gt; Install a whole new harness and watch it crumble?  I don't pretend to know
&gt; every difference in a 72 vs. a 74 harness. That's why I said YOU could
&gt; compare the two. You can move a fuse box, you can ditch a smog pump if you
&gt; don't need it, you can ADD THE EXTRA CABLE as I said.
&gt;
&gt; It's only advice....
