What a question.  What an opportunity to engage in sweet fantasy...

I would spend six months preparing for a trip that would technically begin
in Seattle, where I will be living in a month, but in the fantasy, would
begin at the northernmost end of the panamerican highway. I would drive to
its southernmost end. Back when I bought my first camper bus in 1973, this
was an unfulfilled dream.

Since planning is at least 10% of the fun of a trip, I would find out how
much I would need to spend, save money, rebuild the major components
(engine/transaxle), etc., get the location of parts suppliers along the 
route, and then do it.  

One of the questions I would have to ponder, which again, is 10%, or more
of the fun, is whether I would build a small trailer to pull for my parts
and tools.  AS I live off the backend of the technological curve, I would
rather buy as close to wholesale in advance rather than retail in crisis.
And how complete an engine would I carry?  I would hope for the best and
plan for the worst.  The image of cruising at 60, glasspack growling,
bouncing over rutted roads in the central American jungle, knowing there
is six thousand miles to go raises goosebumps.
