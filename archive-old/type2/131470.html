Subject: Re: [T2] Harbor Freight motorcycle jack on sale

&gt;From: &quot;Chris M.&quot;

&gt;Reckon the price is the same if you walk into the store and buy it? We've 
&gt;got a store 100 miles south in Chattanooga and I think the gas down and 
&gt;back (less than $20) would beat their shipping cost!


Easy enough just print out the ad and take it in with you. Even if the 
online price is different, they will honor the price.
