Subject: rod knocking?

I'm trying to identify a sound in my engine.  I've thought maybe it was a 
loose valve, but now i'm wondering if it is a rod tapping. I was thinking 
that if someone had an engine they know had a rod tapping in it I could call 
them and they could let me listen to the engine run for a second.
Thanks,
Kyle
