	I hope someone is keeping a digest of the answers to this one!

(digression)
I'm having to delete about 3/4 of my list digests because I just
don't have time to read 'em. On the other hand, when we were recently
at ToyRUs, Benjamin (2.1 years old) wanted THREE of the little-tykes plastic
monkey and crescent wrenches, nearly doubling his tool collection. So my
time isn't being wasted :) He's got a plastic box end wrench and a plastic
screwdriver, and a plastic and a wooden hammer. He's got a good grip
on real screwdrivers but lacks the patience for more than a turn or two.
Yet. I can buy him hardware that's too big to swallow :) so this weekend
I got him his own 3/4&quot; X 3&quot; bolt and matching nut and washer :)
	Does anyone know of plastic or wooden socket wrench sets? :)
Mail me privately...
