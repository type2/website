The Bus is in good shape, as far as the body. The headliner is shot.
There is little to no rust in the body, paint is O.K. but could use a
repaint, no primer or patches of body filler. Back seat is good, fronts
are O.K. with small rips and holes. All glass is good, the windshield
has some fogging, but not broke. The engine has a bad valve on #3(no
surprise there) and may need new bearings, however it is a 2.0l with a
Weber carb. I pulled the front brake calipers out and pulled them apart
due to stuck pistons, but I have not rebuilt them. Tires are O.K., but
not all the same brand. 
It is not a camper, but has a sunroof. The bus is in Tacoma Wa. and I
will part it out or take $300 for it all. The engine and trans are
worth $300 to me. If I do sell the parts (mainly the trans), the body
will be available for FREE to anyone that wants it, good for rust
repair panels and stuff.
I will deliver a reasonable distance, keep in mind the price.
