&gt; Sounds like a neat idea.  I only have two questions - where does one
get dry ice?  And how much does it cost?

Many ice companies (the ones that serve the food service industry) can
supply dry ice.  Cost isn't too high, but small quantities are more
expensive per unit mass.

Be careful of confining dry ice.  A little chunk of dry ice sealed in a
soda bottle is a _bomb_!  Also, you must always use insulating gloves or
tongs to handle dry ice.  It will freeze your skin without you even
feeling it!  Otherwise dry ice is quite safe and a great way to keep food
frozen while camping.
