Subject: Re: [T2] setting up trailer lights on a 70 bus ?

Go get a generic flasher box for adding trailer lights to an import. 
Wire per instructions. You have to use the box b/c the VW has separate 
flashers and brake lights, the trailer does not.

If you have an older VW that does not then 1 wire to the bright filament 
on the VW goes to the bright filament on the trailer light. Dim filament 
on the VW goes to both trailer lights (running lights). Ground wire from 
left and right of trailer tie together and through the plug to the 
vehicle and then to a good ground point. Do a good job - i.e. not 
twisting the wires together and taping them. I am a former Navy 
electrician so I worry about that. Could burn your VW down this way and 
you will at least have to revisit the lighting multiple times with the 
twist and tape quality. Might as well save the cash and time by doing it 
right the first time. Not trying to be condescending here. Knew a fellow 
whose car burnt up for this reason with a twist and tape stereo install. 
No fuses. Know of several fires related to wiring issues.

I tied into my lighting in the engine compartment. You can go all the 
way forward to the dash if you want. Take the tail lights apart and find 
the right wire color (or look at the schematics) and follow that same 
wire to the front and choose your junction point.

If the rear lights on the VW don't work reliably it's a good time to R&amp;R 
then. Is it the socket, the grounds or the switches up front? Tail 
lights are good - brake lights are even better!!! Keeps you from getting 
run over! &lt;griN!&gt;
