&gt;Actually it is not at all clear who owns it, or if one person even does.

Looks like it's yours...  ;-P

&gt;The real list admins deserve a lot more consideration than me, certainly,
&gt;and have for a long time. So do the people who continually improve the
&gt;content on the web site.
&gt;

     Mebbe so, but without your dealing with it way back when, the list 
might not even be here anymore, which would make the issue of the folks 
who do the current grunt work moot. Or maybe somebody else woulda done 
the same thing, and you'd have a peaceful life nowadays. But whatever 
might have been, you're paying now for the sins of your youth... Three 
cheers for Hoop the sinner! Like it or not, you're up there with Gerry 
Skerbitz in the pantheon of list moms...  ;-)

&gt;What's important is that it has never mattered who owns it--we've been able
&gt;so far to deal with this in an atmosphere of cooperation and respect, if not
&gt;affection, without anybody threatening to take his ball and go home. I'd
&gt;love it if that could continue.

     If we've managed it for the last 7-8 years, it can continue, no? 
Sometimes the admin staff has to come down with an iron fist. I can dig 
that. While policies such as banning folks that send unsubscribe messages 
seem harsh, the reality is that it keeps the signal to noise ratio high. 
And in these days of hotmail and other free accounts, it's not even a 
terribly severe punishment. Most importantly, it is what has kept the 
list alive for all this time. In time, it seems that most everybody comes 
to this conclusion. I don't expect that to change... 


Peace,
