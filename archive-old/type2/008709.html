&gt;1:  Are the CV bolts liable to strip....how to prevent? (oz. of
&gt; prev. worth lb. of cure)

Just make sure that the sockets are free of debris so that the
12-point tool will seat fully in the socket.  No problem with
stripping if you do that.

Clean the outside of the CV and bolts before you loosen the bolts and
put a plastic bag over the CV once it's loose.  You don't want grit
getting into the CV.

You only have to remove the outer CVs to work on the axles.

&gt;2:  Just remove the CV bolts then lay that critter on floor?
&gt; Grease the CVs while I'm in there?

No, bend a stiff wire that will allow you to hang the CV from the
bodywork of the bus above its normal position.  It's hard to make the
CVs lose a ball, but it can be done!  


&gt;3:  Do I need a 2 armed pulley to remove the wheel axle?  Can I
&gt; drive it back in with a block of wood and a hammer, or preferred
method??

Bentley shows a puller being used, but I've heard of them sliding out
by hand.  You'll have to see for yourself!
