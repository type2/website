Subject: heater box - good idea was used!

Hey guys!
This worked amazing!
It's quiet, believe it or not I have more noticeable power off the go (how 
did that happen)
And $250 Canadian later all tolled up I have a new non-rusting exhaust 
system.
If anyone is interested I could post up pictures later

Take the output manifolds and swap left for right. Now they point  straight 
backwards, and you can get a welding shop to attach two  smaller mufflers, 
one on each. It's what I'm planning to do with  Colleen's sunroof bus.
