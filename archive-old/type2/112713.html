&gt; I was just wondering, how often should I do an oil change on my 74 Camper?
&gt; Is it the normal every 5000kms?
&gt; Or should I do it more often?
&gt;  What type of oil is best to use?


Cara 
Here is my opinion on your questions....
Oil changes really depend on the climate your in, and the type of driving you
do, In your part of the world, If your going to drive from Late October to Late
April, and you only go short distances Less than 30min drive, then you will have
to change your oil more frequently.

If you drive LONG distances,, you should change your oil more frequently,,  

Oil is a topic that you need to make decisions based on a lot of things





&gt; back firing, is there something that I can do to stop this from happening?

What causes the backfiring?  When does it happen?   
If it is happening while decelerating, then maybe you have a hole in the
exhaust, and the air getting in mixes with the rich mixture, and explodes in the
muffler ....fix the hole in the muffler,

If it is happening while accelerating,, then maybe the timing is an issue, or a
valve...
