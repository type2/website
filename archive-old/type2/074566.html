&gt; To all,
&gt; 
&gt; Those who have been on the list for many years know who Ken is but 
&gt; some may not.
&gt; 
&gt; Ken has been at the helm of type2_dot_com for the last 5 years along with 
&gt; an very helpful group of admin folks, including Steve Dolan, David 
&gt; Raistrick, Dave Shwarze ,Thom Fitzpatrick and George Lyle. All the 
&gt; work that Ken and Co have put in has been because out of the goodness 
&gt; of their hearts. Ken has brought wit, humor and intelligence to the 
&gt; forefront of dealing with buses and computers. Ken is a devoted 
&gt; father all around good guy.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to Ken for your enduring commitment. Whether you know it or 
&gt; not you are responsible for helping out a lot of people over the 
&gt; years.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Chris
