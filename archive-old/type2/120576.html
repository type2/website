Subject: oops, I need a proofreader(was speedo cable)

Sorry to those who took the time to reply, what I meant to say was &quot;accelerator cable&quot;, not speedo.
 
So anyways, now that we are all talking about the same thing, is it a good idea to fish the  new accelerator cable through the vehicle using the old cable?  I've looked in my Bently manual and can't seem to find anything.  Probably cause its such an easy thing to do, but those are usually the things that trip me up the most.
 
Thats the last time I send a quick e-mail off at 7:00 on a Saturday morning
 
Thanks everyone
