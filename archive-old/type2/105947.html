Subject: Re: [T2] wiring help???

Snoopy,

Is the single cab a Euro market delivery vehicle? You can check the 
M-code Plate and translate it from a link in the type2 library.  EMDV 
had two bulds in the tail housing and a red/amber lens. Typically, 
where the left back up light is there will be a red lens. This is 
actually a rear fog light. The right side will have clear for the 
back up light which either market is run off a switch from the 
tranny. You will find a  black wire with an inline fuse holder to 
power those. BTW, Many EMDV did not have rear back up lights.

If indeed you do have a EMDV then there may be differences in the 
turn signal arm, the e-flasher and the fuse box. Thom has euro spec 
wiring diagrams posted at www.vintagebus_dot_com.

Good luck
Chris

&gt;&gt;  Did your bus have two bulbs before??
&gt;
&gt;Yes the Single cab &quot;originally&quot; (at least they came with the SC when I got
&gt;her) had a two bulb system with 4 wires coming off.
