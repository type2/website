Subject: Propane Catalytic Heat - Drawback

Hello All,

I've been following with interest the thread on extra heat in busses.  =
I'm still working on my BN4.  I have a Coleman Black Cat catalytic =
heater I use for camping and in the garage.  One day I was working =
inside my bus on a cold day in the driveway without need to open the =
doors.  I decided to use the catalytic heater to keep warm; it worked =
marginally, I thought (didn't get very warm inside, but I wasn't in =
there for more than an hour).  A couple of days later, I opened a steel =
toolbox with sliding drawers I keep in my bus with hand tools in it.  I =
was less than thrilled to see all my tools were covered with ice =
crystals and some droplets of water.  I've had the tools in my bus for a =
couple of winters and never seen this before.  Of course I took my tools =
inside and dried them.  From what I understand, a byproduct of the =
combustion of propane is water vapor.  It seems to me that the water =
vapor I released inside my bus condensed on my tools (and who knows what =
else inside; inside doors, etc) as things cooled.  While the catalytic =
element makes the combustion safe for us to breathe, the water is still =
there.  Has anyone else seen condensation inside their bus from using =
one of these heaters?  I thought I'd bring it up since it seems to me =
I've noticed several list members using these heaters.

Thanks,

Markus Bahnemann
