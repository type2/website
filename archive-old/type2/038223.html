Depends if you want to putter around town on weekends or are heading out on
a 3145 mile round trip Wizzbang World Vacation with Mom and the kinder and
prefer to eliminate CV probs altogether, thank you. But think how amazed
the kids would be if dad saved the day with a spare at the campground
'cause he had the spare and know how. It's a one beer procedure if the
hardware is clean and the essential knowledge and tools are available.  

If it's long unserviced and you are unknowledgable and untooled, it's get
towed to the unknown mercies and virtues of Big John's Big Blocks and
Sometimes VW Repair or the mercies and virtues of a VW dealership, or get
lucky and find nearby an independant that loves VW and knows them well and
he/she will actually fix it for a reasonable compensation before the end of
the day.     

  Reversing them is a great trick, axle
&gt;to axle, changes the contact path that is being worn, I do that every time I
&gt;regrease a set, maybe every 25k or so.
&gt;

I suggest this is the key to John's success at getting maximum milage from
CV's. This also allows easy cleaning of the bolt heads ergo less wear of
the spezial triple hex bit and less frequency of a stripped head. If it has
been serviced regularly the splines as well will be in good order and the
joint will tap off nicely.

Few will be found to honor this essential service. Keep them clean,
lubricated and sealed and they can certainly last 200,000 miles and very
likely 300,000 miles. Or do no maintenance and replace every 80,000-100,000
miles.
