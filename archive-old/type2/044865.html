Only 5, if you leave one out of a chamber.

Well, I agree, but................

When your bed down spot is quite public,
you sort of comfortably know it to be that way.

If it &quot;very extremely remote&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;,
so that you &quot;will never be found&quot;,
but it still turns out that it is not all that remote,
and a strange car comes up on you during the night,
and you &quot;are found&quot;,
it is very terrifying.

I mean,
very terrifying.

Stay &quot;quite public&quot;, or stay in numbers.
Please.
