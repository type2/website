Thanks very much to the evercharming David Raistrick for the space.

To summaraize again this is an OK beater to run with 103k miles
head gaskets and much more at 85k about 2 years ago but...
Body with dents and dings all over, pretty good crease to left rear 
corner and left rear bumper. Trivial (much less than WV average) seam 
rust where body is dented and on seam below drivers door, but OK 
for an '87. Body condition is worst part of this Vanagon. A good beater 
to drive or a great parts van to keep something else running.

Kelley online says $2500 in fair condition, which is about where this 
thing is, asking $1900 with newish 27x8.5R14 Firestones or a bit less 
without on crap to roll you home. Brand new WV safety inspection, 
ready to drive anywhere, worth the asking for the engine and the 
auto tranny alone. Located in Morgantown, WV, about 1.5 hours 
from Pittsburg, 3 from DC or Baltimore.

Will trade for a nice clean rustfree Bus camper body '72-'79 with blown 
engine or tranny of equal value. Must be manual tranny, prefer full 
Westy '76-'78 but will consider hightop Adventurer or Safare, only 
condition of body important, engine or tranny can be blown or not 
even present.

I think I emailed the pic addy to all who were interested, if I didn't
and you need pics actually emailed please email me again, thanks.
