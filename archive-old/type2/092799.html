Subject: RE: [T2] The new pertronix ignitor II, and the 009 problems

--=====================_8595762==_.ALT

Eron, I think you are right.

Copied from &quot;The Classic Corvair&quot; by Bob Helt (on the Corvair list) 
copyright 2002:

The type II Ignitor contains a computer processor for active dwell 
control,and should be able to maintain plug voltage at high rpms The 
voltages tend to fall off at high rpms with both the stock setup (points) 
and Ignitor I. In addition, a higher output voltage coil with a .6 ohm 
primary winding resistance should provide an even greater spark.

Engine RPM                                      Dwell
100-200 rpm                                     10-12 degrees
600                                             7 degrees
800                                             10 degrees
1000                                            12 degrees
1400                                            17 degrees
2000                                            28 degrees
2500                                            37 degrees
3000                                            44 degrees
3300                                            47 degrees
5000                                            43 degrees
6000                                            41 degrees
6500                                            39.5 degree

Ignitor I requires a ballast resistor. It will tolerate a maximum of 8.5 
amps and recommend using one if the coil has a resistance of 1.5 ohms or 
more. If your stock coil has a resistance of 1.28 to 1.42 ohms and your 
charging system makes 14 volts, then on a good day your Ignitor I is seeing 
9.8 amps and exceeding the manufacturers specs.

Maybe this is cause of the failure that some folks 
have?



&gt;&gt;&gt;No, What the Ignitor II does is have active variable dwell.
&gt;
&gt;I believe the new Pertronix II NOW does what any CDI already does.  I 
&gt;believe that in a perfect world, the four cylinder engine has a maximum 
&gt;dwell of 45(please don't hammer me if I'm wrong)degrees per cylinder, but 
&gt;because of the opening and closing time of the points, this number 
&gt;decreases with speed.  It takes a certain amount of time to charge the 
&gt;coil's secondary circuit.  With a computer and an optical pickup, you can 
&gt;achieve an optimum dwell duration at any engine RPM, and ensure a maximum 
&gt;achievable spark.  My Crane CDI does this as well.

Ciao!
