Subject: Re: [T2] Optima Batteries

Minor nit - Optimas are $99 and $102 at Sams and Costco, respectively.  I'm told Costco has a lifetime warranty on anything you buy there - a friend just got his Optima replaced with a brand new one after three years, no charge.  Costco also has an excellent berry sundae.  :)

An Optima or other AGM will deliver a lot more cranking time than a flooded battery (like the Poop Boys one) of equivalent rating thanks to it's superior Peukert's coefficient.  Flooded batteries are really not very good at maintaining their voltage under heavy loads.
