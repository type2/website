&gt;  I tried to make a small donation to the type 2 list via pay pal - I just
&gt;  received the following message:
&gt;  &quot;The funds have been returned to your account.
&gt;  This payment was returned for the following reason(s):
&gt;  donate_at_type2_dot_com did not sign up for a PayPal account or did not complete
&gt;  the registration process.
