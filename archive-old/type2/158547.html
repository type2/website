Subject: Re: [T2] Temperature in Heater Tube

I am  working on my Heater Tube under the center of my '72 Bus.  Does anyone  
know how hot the air gets that runs thru this tube?  The reason I want to  
know is that I may use POR-15 to preserve the inside of the tube before I  
install it.  I have written the POR-15 company to ask about out gassing  and the 
temperature limits of their  product.

hey   masato52????                       I have been POR 15ing  these tubes 
whenever I do them. I don't worry too  much about the inside as much as the 
outside.  I use a truck exhust pipe as  a replacement and cut and tack weld it 
into place . then seam seal it and POR 15  and use the pluming rolled close cell 
insulation .Later and have fun  mark  Dearing  salem import service  salem Va
