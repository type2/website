Subject: engine door seal

I am looking for a 68 engine door seal.  All I seem to find at Bus Depot is 
a complete body rubber kit that includes this seal.  I can't afford $190 
right now although I'd like to do all of them someday.  Anyone sell them 
individually?

This all came about because someone punched/drilled out my locking latch 
yesterday.  The door skin is not too bad around the latch hole.  The seal 
was damaged by a prying tool beyond it's ability to keep the air out.  At 
least this time nothing was stolen.  I guess the moral of the story is that 
even locks are not really good security against a determined theif.  
Whomever or whatever interupted this would-be theif, thank you...
