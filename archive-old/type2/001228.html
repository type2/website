Okay, I'll put my $.02 into the thread... If you are a big fan of type 1
engined busses, the '71 is the way to go in my opinion.  The dual port
engine and power disk brakes are both significant improvements over '68-70.
If you prefer a pancake engine (which I do), the '74-79, and particularly
the '76-79, are all good.  In my mind, the '72-73 doesn't give you the added
power that the Type 4 engine promised to offer, but the '74-up is a
significant improvement over the Type 1 engine in terms of drivability (not
to mention such nicities as being able to change pushrod tubes and the like
without having to pull the engine).  Besides the '72 has a few one-year-only
drawbacks, as has been noted. This and the less convenient poptop layout on
the '72-73 make me lean toward a '74-up. Starting in '76 you get a 2 liter
engine, which frankly doesn't have particularly noticably more power than
the 1.8. But if you are looking for a Westy, you also get a very nice camper
layout, in my opinion much more ergonomically designed than the pre-76 setup
and very similar to the layout used to this day in Vanagons and Eurovans.
If you're in a emissions-sensitive area (outside of California), beware of
the '79, which is the only non-California year to require a (rather pricy)
catalyst exhaust system. Personally, my optimal bay-window bus would be a
'76-78 deluxe Westy.
