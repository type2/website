Subject: [T2] RE: Gauges for 16 yr old's mega tour

Someone asked what gauges they would want their 16 year old to have
for a safe &quot;mega tour&quot;.
I guess if I was sending my kid out the two main gauges I'd want him to have
would be an air bag, and 5ft of fairly unrusted crumple zone.
Just my opinion of course.
