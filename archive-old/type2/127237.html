Subject: OUCH $150 for a mecahnical fuel pump, how about
  electric?!?!?!?!?

OUCH!!! That 72 Westy I just mentioned also needs a
fuel pump. The two least expensive online retailers
list the stock mechanical pump $149 &amp; $159 !!!!! 
Thats more than we have in the engine!! So, what does
it take to put one of those after market electric fuel
pumps on a 1700 Dual carb engine?  Is a pressure
regular needed in this set up??
