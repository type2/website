&gt; Anyone else ever replace this part? I was hoping to find some kind of
&gt; non-asbestos, after market replacement. The Bus Depot seems not to have
&gt; such a one.

Surfer Bob,
First off yes it can fall off AMHIK and secondly it is NLA in the USA new. Not
thru aftermarket or anything.  The easiest replacement will come from a
salvage yard.  The second option (which is what I did)  Is to put a plea to
the list (which you have done).  A kind list member from Europe sent me one
after I sent the cash.  The part is still available from VW over there.  It
arrived no problem.  Even came with some cool German newspapers which was cool
to look at.

Peace Brother,
Snoopy
