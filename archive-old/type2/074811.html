Subject: Re: [T2] BN4 ducting

Did you try Lowe's?  They have some tin adapters there that look 
very similar.  I bet you could find something that would work with 
some modifications.  The adapters are supposed to be for 
ventilation systems - I recently had to deal with them when 
installing some ducts for a range hood in our house.

&gt;I wonder if anybody has a parts bus with the duct still in it 
that converts the square heat ducting to a round duct:

&gt;
&gt;So I can mate it with something I can get at the hardware store. 
I hate to just tape them together. Any ideas? I didn't SEE 
anything like this at the store.
