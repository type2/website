Subject: FRIDAY - Keeping Warm

Hi Folks,

Tomorrow is Engine Day!  In addition to being Groundhog Day and the pagan 
holiday of Candlemas, I'm putting in my newly-rebuilt Jake Raby 2.0 FI, and 
Sweet Pea will be running again!  I'm very excited, except for the fact that 
it's expected to be crystal-clear and about 12 degrees (F).

So, as a Friday thing, I wanted to get some ideas from The List on how 
cold-weather folks keep warm while they work outside.  So far I've tried to 
bundle up, put on gloves and wool socks, drink hot tea, get a heater, and 
take frequent warm-up breaks.  Short of having a heated garage, this is 
about the best I can do.

Thanks for any suggestions or ideas...

Jason Upper
Aspen, Colorado
1979 Westy &quot;Sweet Pea&quot;  &lt;-- to be running by next week!
