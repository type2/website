Subject: Re: [T2] sevice in minneapolis??

I've never heard of Good Carma.  I've also heard that the VW Man does good 
work but I do my own so no personal experience there either.  You might also 
try J.A.C Automotive at the Anoka/Ramsey city borders.  They also do very 
good work there and Jerry Coffin, owner and fellow Twin Cities Volkswagen 
Club member, has had a few, about 3 I think, of his bugs in the VW mags.

&gt; I live in the Minneapolis area and am looking for a good shop to bring my 
77 
&gt;  westy to have some work done.  I have the engine tore down and in pieces 
on 
&gt;  my work bench and don't have the time to put rebuild it myself.  Where is 
a 
&gt;  good place to bring it in this area?  I called the VW Man in Minneapolis 
and 
&gt; 
&gt;  he told me to call Good Carma.  I have heard that the VW Man does good 
work 
&gt;  but have never heard anything about Good Carma.  Any info. would be 
helpful.
