&gt; I am so excited. I'm actually driving around now. The engine seems to have
&gt; mellowed out. The brakes are working fine. I got a friend to help me with
&gt; making a new canvas pop-up. She did an excellent job and it only cost about
&gt; $120. Now to put it back in :(! Hey, one thing is bothering me. The boots
&gt; on the CV joints - They'er busted. Does anyone make a replacable boot that
&gt; doesn't require removing the axle? 

Nope.  removing the axle builds character!  If you want to go the quick
route, some auto parts outfits offer replacement axles that you simply
exchange with yours.  Otherwise get ready for the greasiest job on a bus!


Also, I still have no turning signals.
&gt; The flasher may be bad. Where is the flasher located? Thaks!

It plugs into the bottom of the fuse block.  You have to disconnect the
battery (to prevent nasty sparks!), unclip the fuse block (the clip is the
metal tab in front with the rectangular hole) and lift the fuse block.
The flasher relay is one of the little boxes on the bottom of the block.
