Hi folks,

I have a very nice 1971 Campmobile. It has original interior, except for the
interior panels. It is white. It sports new tires a very clean interior.
Needs very little bodywork. Only around the rear fenders. These are not
rusted out, but rather were hit and poorly bondo'd. The Camper is missing
the sink unit and the childs cot. The tent is good, with only one small rip.
The windshield is new, and there is a new stereo in it. (Jenson AM-FM Tape
removeable with dual coaxials mounted in the overhead cabinet in the rear.)
Top is freshly painted with new seals. New windsheild and seal. New tires.
Transmission is strong. Freshly painted rims, bumpers and emblem. The
undercarraige is spotless, with lots of attention to detail in cleaning and
restoring. Also, undercoated. New curtains match new interior panels.
Heat exchangers are good, but are bug.

Currently it has a Strictly Foreign 1776 with dual kadron's 40mm and an
Engle 110 cam.
The engine has less than 2000 miles on it..
Have receipts on engine for $1850.00 +
Engine seeps a little oil, but not much. A few drips when parked.

I will sell the camper with the 1776cc for $3,850.00 or without for
$3,250.00 (with a straight, freshly rebuilt 1600cc stock engine.)

I am going to try to get pictures scanned and on my website by thursday. If
the price discrepancy between the larger engine and stock seems small, it is
because I am running out of time and space. I have multiple projects going
on, and this one can not continue. It is inspected and has been used for the
last few seasons. An good buy, and an excellent start towards a show quality
bus.

Call Matt at 603.692.4800
or email me at matthewd_at_mediaone_dot_net

I will entertain any reasonable offer...
