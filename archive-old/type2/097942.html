Subject: Re: [T2] ball joints/time

Hello All    Any good shop will have a ball joint tool for doing this job on 
the vehicle. Mitcell books give 3.5 hours to do all 4 .  I would ask to see 
the labor rate book that this shop is using, also didn't you get an estimate 
before they did the work. Here in Virginia I have to be within 10 % of the 
estimate. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem Import Service Salem Va
