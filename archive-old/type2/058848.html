Subject: Beam greasing report

Thanks everyone who replied to my post asking how much grease to get for
the front end.  The amount everyone used varied by a lot so I bought 2
cartridges and ended up using about 1.5.  I noticed it was hard to tell
when to stop pumping because you get a mixture of old and new grease
coming out, with the two virtually the same colour.
