Subject: Sunroof parts needed

Hi,

After using the sunroof in my van by opening it by hand and then sticking it shut with tape because the seal was completely gone :-( I've decided to get it working properley and buy some new parts. Unfortunatley because I live in the UK sunroof vans seem few and far between and most parts companies don't stock spares. I'll probably order the cable from Wolfsburg West but what I'm really getting stuck on is the plastic guide that fits over the winding gear. This is all cracked and I guess my new cables might get damaged if I don't replace it. Does anyone know where I might get this part or maybe even has one to sell?

Thanks

Al
