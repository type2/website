Subject: Re: tin screws and westy vs campmobile

&gt; westfalia is a company aligned with VW that made (makes?) the 
'official vw'
&gt; camper sold through the dealerships.   

that s correct

Westfalias say westfalia on them, on
&gt; the pop top on the post splittys, and on a tag on the bus 
and/or on the
&gt; camper kit.
&gt; 
&gt; campmobile i think is just another name for camper van.   I 
think they used
&gt; that word on my ols 73's westy plate

I seem to think that they first referred to westy's as 
campmobiles around 1967. I know that my 1971 westy had a silver 
sticker with black lettering that said &quot;campmobile&quot; on the pass. 
side of the cold box. Basically I think the term &quot;Campmobile was 
a term originated by VW and WEsty to make their camper conversion 
more &quot;appealing&quot; to the N. American audience. I don't know that 
many N. Americans would necessarily co-realte &quot;Westfalia&quot; with a 
&quot;Camper&quot;, so VW and WEsty decided to add a more self-evident 
term. Oddly in the late 70's the term seems to have been chucked 
and then went back to calling them &quot;Westfalia's&quot;. In 1979 they 
even took to putting the &quot;Westfalia&quot; name on the back of the pop 
top.
