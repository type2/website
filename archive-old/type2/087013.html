&gt; Hmmmm... that could be a pretty fun and useful programming project.  What
&gt; kind of interest would you guys see in something like this for our beloved
&gt; aircooled buses.  I'm envisioning a simple Microsoft Windows application, or

not everyone runs micro$oft windoz.......

running a Linux box and no intention of ever using windoz anything!  sort
of like driving a type 2, damn good even if not every one can appreciate
it.

&gt; if we really wanted to get snazzy it could be a Palm Pilot app...  If you
&gt; guys would be willing to help me out with the actual content, I might be
&gt; interested in writing the application itself (especially if there was a
&gt; chance I could get some sort of tiny donations to help pay for my time,
&gt; seeing as how I'm a starving college student and all &lt;grin&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; What do you guys think?  Sound like something worth looking into?
