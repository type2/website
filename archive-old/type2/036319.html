Subject: Re: electronic ignition and a heat exchanger?

It seems like one of those modifications that have no &quot;down side&quot; to it. I
put one on Itch just to make the dizzy one less thing to worry about.

BTW - one other great mod was to get the Berg GB-227 oil temp dipstick. If
the oil light flickers (220 degrees) when I'm racing the big Semis up hills,
I slow down. Cheap insurance.

&gt; I put a Pertronix electronic ignition on my 73 1800 dual carb last summer
. love it it's
&gt; great to forget about timing and points . no noticable change in
performance .
