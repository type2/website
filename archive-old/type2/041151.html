Well, Sir, in my experience working at the local service station, the  not so
local chrysl3r dealership, and my own garage, there is usually a coating on new
rotors.  It's some kind of yellow goo that gets sprayed on.  It comes off nicely
with carb cleaner.  It's there to prevent rust before purchase.

    I've never forgotten to take off the coating.  I'd imagine if you did, the
disks would be fine, just remove said coating.  The pads on the other hand,
might be a little hurt.  Maybe you could sand a bit off and they'd stop
squealing, but maybe you'd have to buy a new set.  Make sure you sand it all
off, because it's going to be glazed on there.

    Have a nice day.
