Subject: Back to the Trans Oil.

        After reading the recent posts on trans fluid, i went through my 
stuff and found  that the oil i used was a GL-5. Its Castrol, for limited 
slip, and says that its good for all conventional applications. I even went 
through my manual before purchasing this oil, and decided that it was the 
proper stuff. I put it in last spring, and have driven many miles since then 
without noticing any symptoms. I was planning on changing it soo, but will go 
out tomorrow to get the right stuff.
      How bad of a thing is this? I dont suppose that it could cause that 
much damage, right?  Also, i wanted to know if anybody had any suggestions or 
tricks on filling it back up? As i remember, it was about impossible to get 
in there with the bottle, and i tried a few methods which were all rather 
messy. Its a 79 manual with the fill plug half way up the driver side.
