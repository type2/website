I concur.  I never use the access hatch to change my plugs.  I don't use a
wobble extension either.  And you know what?  It's an easy thing to do.
Why do so many people think it's difficult to change out spark plugs on a
'72??

&gt;Complete utter bull.  Oil should be black after a correct factory service
&gt;interval.

Absolutely.  Mine is usually a VERY dark bown - nearly black by 3,000
miles.  Has always been that way.  On the occasions where I have let it go
a bit longer (but still less than 5k miles), it gets very black.

&gt;&gt;But the DM lives on in the 4 decades of German production prior to the
&gt;&gt;90's. You know, the ones WE got, and with continued DM they will outlive
&gt;&gt;the compromises in current manufacture.

Hmmm... I would be hesitant to claim that any T1, T2, or T3 type II will
outlast a T4 if serviced properly.  There have just been too many advances
in engine design, lubrication, cooling, etc.

&gt;&gt;I can see a day several years from now when a VR-6 Eurovan comes in for
&gt;&gt;it's 100,000 mile spark plug replacement and two of six plugs bring the
&gt;&gt;threads out with them. Let's see, R&amp;R plugs every 100,000 miles, includes
&gt;&gt;R&amp;R heads, $2500 to do it right, maybe half that to jurusrigus. Then the
&gt;
&gt;A final note, the spec on the excessively expensive surface gap plugs on my
&gt;'91 G60 Corrado was of course also 90k.  Took them out and looked at them
&gt;at 30k, and replaced them at 60k for the hell of it but there was no
&gt;improvement
&gt;for doing so.

I left a set of plugs in my Mustang for about 70,000 miles once.  I just
kind of forgot about them since the car continued to start on the first
try, idle smooth, get 25mpg on the highway, and fly through California's
smog check.  This despite 140,000 miles on the clock.  When I eventually
replaced the plugs (along with the rotor, cap, and original plug wires) I
noticed no change at all.  Sure, I could have thrown away money and good
parts by replacing stuff every 10-30k miles, but that would be just plain
DuMb now wouldn't it?  :)  If not dumb, it's at least wasteful.  Don't
throw money at your vehicle, give it only what it needs instead.  That
means frequent fluid changes (oil, coolant if applicable, and brake fluid)
and maybe more depending on how old your vehicle is.

Unnecessary parts replacement is a tactic used by shady mechanics to pad
their wallets.  There is a fine line between this and replacing parts like
spark plug wires when there is nothing wrong with them except that they are
a few years old.
