&gt; I have a 72 bus that has a Single Weber Carb on it and it back fires when I
&gt; let off the gas completly.  My mechanic (who I decided not to use anymore
&gt; because off things that the mailing list has told me and for personal
&gt; reasons) told me that it was the carb and it can't be fixed because it is not
&gt; a VW carb.  If its not to hard of a job I'd like to try and do it myself.
&gt; Can someone please help me.  I new to this kind of work so if your replies
&gt; can be as detailed as possible I'd appreciate it.

If this guy is as big of a quack as you say he is, it might not be the carb
at all. Timing and exhaust leaks (easier to pick up than you think) cause
backfiring too. So start by setting your timing.
