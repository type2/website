The following is assuming you do NOT have fuel
injection:
MAKE SURE you are in neutral with parking brake
applied!!! Unhook the negative cable from your battery
FIRST. Then, take a wire with a female push-on
terminal on one end and attach that end to the small
MALE push-on terminal on the solenoid of the starter
(you will have to remove a wire from that terminal, it
comes from the ignition switch).  Take another wire
and run it from the positive lead of the battery to
the (+) or &quot;15&quot; terminal on your coil (OPPOSITE the
side that has the distributor condensor attached). 
Now re-hook up the negative battery cable.  Go back to
the first wire which you attached to the starter
solenoid, and touch the bare end to the positive lead
on the battery. Your starter should now crank over the
engine and start. You can now pull off the wire
attached to the starter solenoid and drive home.
BE CAREFUL!!
