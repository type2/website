Gotta question folks - I've had low oil pressure ever since I first 
installed my VDO oil gauge. I'm not saying the VDO gauge is the cause - 
just that it confirm suspicions I had about my engine's oil pressure.

However - I have my VDO connected to the engine via 3&quot; of brass adaptors 
and wonder if it would be possible to get air trapped between the pressure 
sender and the oil passageway and cause problems - air being compressible. 
If true then the adaptor hose some of the Bus suppliers sell would have 
even more troubles - right?

Show I try to bleed this sender adaptor and if I did would I have the same 
problem when the engine was turned off and the oil drained back to the 
bottom of the engine?

Enquiring minds want to know...

My piece of info to offer - if you have leaks around your engine on thread 
holes, oil pan plugs, and pressure senders - Loctite brand has a hydraulic 
connection sealant. Looks like red Loctite but seals very, very well on 
oily, hot places. Don't think it would stand up well to fuel. This will 
seal the oil pressure sender without electrically isolating the sender 
(which the sender needs to ground itself and complete the circuit).
