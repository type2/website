Subject: Oil levels???
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello everyone.. I have a developed the obsessive compulsive habit of 
checking my oil every morning before I hit the road in my 71 
Campmobile...However...this morning I check the level and it was just over 
the first mark on the oil dip stick(pretty low I guess)....so I didn't add 
any oil..drove for about 20 minutes tops...had the bus parked for 5 hours or 
so...went to check the level before I left work and the oil level was much 
higher..almost to the top line on the dip stick...Any ideas what is going on 
here? Thanks for the help...Adam
