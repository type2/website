Subject: RE: [T2] 15&quot; rims for my '78 Westy

http://www.gowesty_dot_com/ has 15 inch rims. They even have factory looking

your old hubcaps. Did the Brazilian buses go to 15 inch rims? Where is
GoWesty getting these?

IIRC, gowesty is having someone reweld the stock centers on a 15 inch rim. A
