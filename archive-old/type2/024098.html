Let me tell you, well you know that nut is a bear.  Whenever I purchase 
another road worthy bus or bug the first stop is the tire and brake shop.  
There I have them do their inspection and then mandate that they only put the 
lugnuts and wheel hubs by hand.  They usually gripe and groan but they do it. 
 Then I let my wife try to break one of each loose.  If she can do it than 
the shop passed.  If not they do it again.  Its worth it in the long run.
