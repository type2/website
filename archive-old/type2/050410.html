Subject: [T2] Replace ball joints? 

I was giving my 73 camper the ole winter inspection the other night and  
noticed my boots on both of my my lower ball joints
were torn, the top's are fine. So I cheeked the archive's  and found a lot 
of information, and if I need to replace these things
I am going to order the torsion arms from Bus Boys. Thus my question how do 
I know if I need to replace the current ball joints?
I drove my bus last in November and there were not any noises or clicking or 
chunking sounds from the front end.
I also checked for play in the joints last night and did not see any.

Thanks
Mike
