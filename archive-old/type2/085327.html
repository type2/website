Subject: RE: [T2] ebus 2002 photos (canadian version)

Did you make your way through Charlottesville Va? My wife said that she saw
a group of busses parked at the Wal-Mart in Charlottesville and at least one
had leaves painted on it. I have seen pictures of this bus on the web before
but could not find any pictures to show her until you sent these.

Above is a link to the plethora of pictures I took at Everybus 2002. Lotsa
pictures, may be a little slow loading for those on dial-up, but I
thumbnailed them for quicker viewing.....

Enjoy and thanks again to Chris for another GREAT campout and I look forward
to my 3000km trip again next year!
