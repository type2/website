Subject: possible purchase of bus -- first post

Hello, this is my first post to the list, although I've been lurking for
awhile.

I have been looking at busses for a little while, as me and my girlfriend
would like to get one and take a road trip in it to the east coast (from
NM).

I've found a bus that is really nice, but I think they might be asking too
much, so I wanted to get your opinion on the bus.   It's a 1970 westy
hardtop (supposedly).   The price they're asking is $6000.   Its been
completely stripped and all rust removed then repainted to white.   The
interior is completely redone to (supposedly) original condition.   The
motor and gearbox have been rebuilt approx. 10k  miles ago to original
specs.  It has a new braking system including master cylinder and all drums
and shoes.    The seller showed me receipts that totalled to about 10k.   3k
alone for the body and paint.

Here are a few pics:

Oh, and it has new curtains that are still in the box.

The question I have are: (1)what should I look for on this bus that may
spell trouble and (2) is it priced too high.    I'm really new to this
arena, so any help would be appreciated.

thanks for any help,

mike
