Subject: Re: [T2] So where are all those who drop tranny w/engine

Mike i have done both dropped the engine with tranny in and also with it(tranny) sitting on a jack stand.
my opinion if you have help you can drop it without taking out those dreaded tranny bolts that yes are hard to get to.
1.take off the two pieces of tin on left side starting with the curved piece under the fan housing and the one to the left of it under the solenoid.
take off the solenoid and take off your two nuts one for the starter and the other the left top nut motor mount. and then the bottom two nuts on the motor mounts.
make sure everything is clearred fuel lines and wiring and any other... pull straight back on the enigne and wallahhhh there it slides back hoping that you already had the jack under it and ready so that you can once away and back from the motor mounts you can let it down///.// the down fall to this is you will either have to have another jack to jack the bus up and roll it out from under it or you will have to lay the motor on the concrete or ground and slide it out from under the bus...
 
i usually use ramps when i pull the motor with the tranny bolts taken out and rest the tranny on a jack stand.. this is usually a pull by myself but have done this with others as well when there was help...
 
up to the person and such..
i just figured out not two weeks ago actually how the motor could even come out with out removing them.
sorry for
blahh blahhh
peace

Well, the 75 has everything disconnected, and I'm contemplating dropping
them together as the tranny must go- but no one responded to my qu re
this- I think it is nearly impossible to get to the upper trans mounts
near the bell housing, as the head side faces where the starter/top of
tranny is, and the nuts hide where you can't see them unless the engine
is out! Worse, how do you line them up when rejacking the combo up -
will the holes magically line up when the nose and rear carrier are
rebolted? This idea seems good for a 71 bus, but a late bay??
