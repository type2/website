Subject: Those awful sunroofs

Looking for advice.

I have a 79 that has the sunroof siliconed in place. That in itself looks
bad and probably means the worst regarding fixing it.
I asked the local VW mechanic and restoration expert about helping me fix
it, and he informed me that the only time he threatened to quit working on
VWs was when the VW Dealer he worked for made him work on broken
sunroofs.....

So, what are the choices?
#1  Bite the bullet and fix it. Cables are $94 a piece (need two) at
Wolfsburg West. Add seals and we are getting into the $400 dollar range.
#2 Yank it off and replace it with something:
    a. a poptop camper fits over the hole. Many sizes will fit. It would
cost a minimum of $200+ for an old poptop+ seals+stuff
    b. a ragtop sunroof, like the fancy one in California.... I have heard
these things exceed $1000. (what's more I have never even seen one....and at
prices like that, I can see why....)

Ideas? Suggestions?

Thanks
