Subject: NEW: Gas Leak,  Aaaack!!!! (fuel leakage on left side) and
  isolator information

First off I would like to say thanks for all the great help I got on the 77
westy wiring diagram.  I have chosen to disconnect the stock relay and go
with Sure Power model #952R (95 amp max with external regulator).  I read
earlier that someone was complaining that the isolator was consuming 1 volt
so I called them (Sure Power).  The information I received was that if you
remove the regulator wire for the alternator and connect it the &quot;R&quot; post of
the isolator block (the wire needs to be shortened) the one volt will be
consumed before regulation occurs. Assuming the alternator puts out 15
volts (which I have not yet hooked up my volt meter to confirm yet) after
the 1 volt consumption by the diodes in the isolator block you should have
14 volts going to the regulator which will still put out the proper 13.7
volts.  This all sounds great in theory, doesn't it?  My isolator will get
to me in 5 to 7 day, I will tell you guys how it works out.  If you call
Sure Power they will FAX you specific installation instruction for the westy.

Now after that long winded paragraph,
I too had the problem of gas spilling out when I made a left turn (I got
the fuel filler neck from Rocky Mountain Motorworks for $19.95).  Now I am
having this strange problem of fuel leaking onto the axillary battery tray,
on the left hand side, when I fill to a full tank of gas.  I removed the
fire wall to see what was going on in there but didn't seem to see any
problems.  Any suggestions on what to do would be great.

Thanks, Harry
