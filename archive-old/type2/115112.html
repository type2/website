Subject: VW seal adhesive

I was reading through the yellow workshop manual and on the subject of tail
lights it states that you can use a Type 4 seal for the lights. This
explains why they aren't the correct size: vw says to trim them to size.

It also talks about securing the seal with VW Seal Adhesive. Does anyone
know what that is or a modern substitute?
