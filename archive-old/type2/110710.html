Subject: [T2] ruff gears new/used tranny

Thanks Jim,Karl,and Richard.

I am off to the auto store today to get the gear oil.
I am thinking this is the problem.
I dont know how long this 79 tranny has been out of commission but was sold to me with the intentions that it was a good tranny for my 76 transporter.

The sequencers went out in my 76 tranny.
The gears in the 79 feel really ruff and not smooth almost like they need to be greased.
Hope i am right be about time for me to finally get to drive it.
Bought it and been working on it ever since cause of the tranny.
first the 76 and now the 79.
Looking for a rebuilt 2.0ltr engine but wanted the 79 tranny to hold up until at least i could have it (the engine) rebuilt or shortly after.
thanks 
Cha
