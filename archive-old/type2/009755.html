I have just cleaned the poptop quite succesfully, with liquid all
fabric bleach. I used the cheaper store brand from the local Tops
supermarket. You may use any brand, just be sure it has the warning on
the label, &quot;Caution, contains hydrogen peroxide&quot;. The hydrogen peroxide
is the magic ingredient. Put the all fabric bleach in a spray bottle.I
wetted down the top, and scrubbed off with just water and a stiff scrub
brush first. Rinse, then spray liberaly with the all fabric bleach. It
will foam up. Let is sit a couple of minutes, scrub, and rinse (be sure
to rinse it off of the body too). Repeat. It took a little more elbow
grease than X-14 would have, but the all fabric bleach is a less
caustic cleaner. It's action is self limiting also. It will stop
foaming after a couple of minutes. I did 1/2 a side at a time (length
of a picinc bench I had to stand on). But I kept spaying on the all
fabric bleach on the whole side as it stopped foaming. Now the top
looks respectable again. And I didn't have to worry about damaging the
paint. X-14 has warnings not to use on painted surfaces.
