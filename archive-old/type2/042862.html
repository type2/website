Subject: Re: Observations on Bus Owners Driving Techniques

When I first started driving a bus, I figured out that if I put it in second
when the needle hits 20, third at 30, and fourth at 40, I could get where I
wanted to go without stalling.  Once I got used to it, (I'm on my second bus
now, a 2000cc) I just shifted by . . . well I don't know.  But I know when to
shift.  It's like the bus and I are in liquid motion.  It's pretty cool.  Drives
as smooth as any of those stupid, gas hauling, SUVs out there.  How come I have
an SUV with a 4 cyl, and all the other ones are 8 cyl?  And why are the 8 cyl
ones afraid to drive on gravel and rutty roads?  My bus doesn't even feel it.

    Yeah.  Rock on to the vw.

&gt; shift. We don't have a tach
