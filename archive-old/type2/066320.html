Hey Mike,
  how about a few do's and don'ts, now that you are the expert in that
procedure? Any special tools, costly mistakes???
  Well, you guessed it: That very same job is on the horizon for me as
well, in the not too distant future...
  Ciao,

&gt;
&gt; Well I spent yesterday afternoon doing my first ever shock install.
&gt; Removed the old shocks from my '70 camper and installed some nice new
&gt; KYB gas-adjust shocks.  Those old things were in BAD shape and what a
&gt; difference these new ones have made. Solved my front end &quot;crunch&quot; noise
&gt; problem.  While under the front end, I noticed that some of the rubber
&gt; &quot;seals&quot; or bushings or whatever they're called, (I think they are the
&gt; &quot;ball joints&quot; from looking at Bentley book) are worn pretty bad and
&gt; nearly splitting.  Can I replace those individually i.e. without whole
&gt; new torision arms or whatever?
&gt;
&gt; Oh yeah, I got the KYB shocks from a local place here in Boulder called
&gt; Recycle Auto Parts for about $38 each.  If you're ever in the area, look
&gt; them up - they have nearly everything you'd want and Jim, the owner, is
&gt; as friendly as helpful as I've experienced.  He doesn't even mind
&gt; answering my &quot;dumb&quot; newbie questions!  Of course, usual disclaimers blah
&gt; blah blah.
