&lt;My fuel pump on my 82 Westy is making a loud buzzing noise.  I'm going to
replace the fuel filter in the hopes that the pump is just starved for fuel
(it seems to run o.k.). &gt;
Bosch does not make noisy fuel pumps..just ask 'em!
I've found all *kinds* of weird stuff in in the inlet to the pump..even with a
&quot;good&quot; filter in front of it.so check when you have the filter off, eh?

 
Weeeeeeelllllllllll, Yes...sort of........the van *will* start and run on
it..most of the small electrics will make 6-8 lbs of pressure...the van
*needs* 28-45....(depending on manifold pressure) ..wait..I feel a story
coming on:..........
I used to do sublet work for a busy VW shop..he sent me a vanagon camper with
a burned out automatic..It would move, but barely...towed it home, rebuild the
tanny and drove it the 18 miles back to the shop....well,no, I got about 2
miles and pulled over because there was something *seriously* wrong with this
bus..ran smooth, shifted OK..but come to a hill? OYE!  checked the fuel
pressure...........7 lbs........looked under the bus...&quot;Facet&quot; said the
pump.....Hoe-boy..and it look as if it had been in there a while...swapped out
the pump when I got to the guys shop....the customer then admitted that in the
8 months he'd owned it he had never gotten 60 mph out of it...
I suspect the tranny died of overwork and overheating........
So ,*YES*,...... it will get you to a place to buy the correct pump...but
slowly....
