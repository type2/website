Subject: Buses Of The Corn, 2006 -- August 18th to 20th, 2006

Hi Volks,

It's official, the date has now been confirmed for the sixth annual  
Buses Of The Corn in Brooklin Ontario. The date is a bit later this  
year in order to avoid conflict with the popular Embrun Volksfest  
near Ottawa.

On August 18th - 20th we'll once again gather for a type2  
extravaganza that includes the ever-popular FMBC Burrito Breakfast, a  
swap meet, tie-dye workshop, Frisbee golf, Bus Driving challenge, pot- 
luck dinner, corn roast and group campfire.

BOTC is generously sponsored by GermanSupply_dot_com and SCOPE  
engineering. For more information you can visit our website at

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
