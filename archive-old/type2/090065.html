Subject: Fuel Filter Folly?

All this talk about fuel filters has got me wondering.  How often SHOULD you 
change the fuel filter on a fuel-injected bus?  

I put the FI system on my 73 nearly 20,000 miles/3 years ago and have never 
changed the filter.  On my 74 914 with FI, I've been running the same filter 
for 35,000 miles/4 years.  I know both of my gas tanks are good and clean and 
I'm not experiencing any problems, but am I asking for trouble?

Thanks.
