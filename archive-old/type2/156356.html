Subject: Re: [T2] Costa Rica

I've spent quite a bit of time down there on and off cruise  ships.  I like Costa Rica a lot.  But there is quite a lot of  danger in Guatemala.  I'm not sure if the highway goes through any  of the bad areas but there are a lot of hijackings, kidnappings, and  even murders.  It is listed on the CIA site as having many  dangerous areas.  I've been down to Puerto Montt, Chile  also.  That is really nice.  In the arctic circle.  I  would really like to make that trip but wouldn't do it alone and would  probably hire bodyguards to take through any danger areas.   Especially in Colombia.  It would be great fun, though.   Panama is cool in some areas, squalor in others.  A friend of mine  saw a couple get mugged right after they got off the ship in  Colon.  Most cruise lines won't even stop in Panama anymore.   Too bad because it is one of the best shopping places in the  world.  All kind of goods from all over the world at a fraction of  what they cost here.  I'm sure that's
 true on VW parts, too.   But I never found a good store.  Congrats and thanks for tweaking  my interest.  Cheers...KR

Just got back from Costa Rica.  I was able to see  4 buses, talk to one
owner, through a interpreter, and get a picture of her with her bus.
heeheeee, she could not for the life of her, understand why I wanted a
picture of her in front of a beat up ole' bus.  She said she brought the one
from the Factory to her home.  Some things I noticed.. I could not find the
VIN tag on the dash, of any of them???  The 75 had a trip meter, is this
rare on a 75 VDO?  What appeared to be a 71, had the rear apron, but had
bigger rear lights..perhaps a 72?
So I also learned the ultimate road trip.... The Pan-American highway will
take you all the way from Alaska to Costa Rica, and perhaps beyond!!!  Now
that is an adventure waiting to happen.  My wife says I would never make it
past the Bandito's of Mexico or Nicaragua.  None the less, it is fun to
think about.

Any one on the list from South Central Costa Rica?
