&gt; Would you please fill me in on the &quot;gas-fired aux heater&quot; details.

all the details are in the archives, the way I did it and others.  the
amount of work is in inverse proportion to the amount of money you wish to
spend.

WEBASTO makes a gas unit about the size of a gallon paint can that will
drive you out and only takes a fuel line and power but it is about $1,000
used by truckers to keep thier sleepers warm without running the engine.

the other end of the cost line is to refurbish an older Eberspracher(sp)
which is what I did, total spent about $200 but LOTS of work and cutting
and pasteing.
