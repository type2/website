Subject: gas sending unit and ohms?

Ok, so I have the sending unit out of the gas tank.  I dial in my ohm meter to
zero and touch the two leads  = 0  I move the float either to full up or full
down and = 0   no change in the needle at all.  So I trot down to the flaps
and they have one for 35 dollars.

not being one to just be spending the $$ I say, hey can I test yours and
compare... sure.... Their brand new out out of the box = 0 in all settings and
float positions.

Somebody help me....
