Subject: Testing brake light switches

Volks,

There are three terminals on the brake lamp switches that are screwed into
the master cylinder.  one of these is the common terminal, one is normally
closed (foot not on brake) and one is normally open (foot on brake).
Schematically it looks lomething like this:

Normally open -----------------------------|
                                           |

Common ----------------------------------
                                         \
                                          \
Normally Closed --------------------------|

So what you want to do is:

1) disconnect the plug from the switch
2) turn the VOM to Ohms or continuity
3) take your VOM down under the car and
4) touch the leads to pairs of terminals on the switch until the VOM
   indicates 0 ohms or continuity (these terminalls are connected with no
   resistance)
5) have someone step on the brakes - the continuity/0 resistance should
   disappear
6) the third terminal (the one you are not using) is the normally open
   terminal, by process of elimination
7) one of the other two is the common terminal
8) move one lead to the third terminal, while your friend has his foot on
   the brake
9) move the other lead to each of the other two terminals
10)one of these terminals will show the same 0 resitance/continuity.
   That's the common terminal!
11)Take foot of brake, continuity should disappear

I *think* that the pattern is:   normally open -  |  | - normally closed
                                                   --
                                                 common

but it has been too long :-(  If you have questions, ask away!
