Subject: Re: [T2] Fan removal

Bill;
   For what it's worth, here's my experience. Was doing the same thing.
Removed the three bolts, tapped it with rubber hammer. No go. Applied
penetrating oil. Tried again. No go. Attached a three armed gear puller,
tightened it up to a frightening level. No go. Left it on overnight. No go.
Applied physics, heated up the hub with a pencil torch going round and
round to avoid too much heat and then, BANG, the hub, gear puller and the
end of the pencil torch flew a good ten feet. Hub off.
   Try it, but stand to the side and wear goggles.

&gt; Wanted to ask some advice. I am trying to get the fan on my 78 Westy. I
&gt; removed the three bolts and have given
&gt; it a few hard tugs. I though about giving it a few smacks with the
&gt; rubber mallet, but don't know how easy it is
&gt; to damage the crank seal or fan. I tried the usual oil and break away
&gt; spary. No luck yet. I need to get the fan housing off to replace the
&gt; seals on the oil cooler. Ideas anyone? Thanks
