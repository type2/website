Bill said:

&gt;I have a  84 Winnebego Le Sharo sitting 400 mi away in Austin Tx.. It needs
&gt;$3200 worth of work to get it back on the road (pistons,heads,rings,hoses).
&gt;I really want a Deluxe to go with my 86 Wolfsburg.  Should I throw good
&gt;money at the Le Sharo and delay the Deluxe, or try to salvage the Le Sharo?

This brings to mind a conversation I had with a mechanic last summer
that used to work on these things all of the time at a Winnebago dealer.
He said that the engines in these are just crap. They are built by
Renault, and are very unreliable. He also said that in his experinece,
20,000 to 30,000 miles was the lifetime of one of these engines.
