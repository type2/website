Subject: Porta-Potti Help, Suggestions

I'm thinking of buying a porta-potti for the old westy!  I was wondering
what those of you who have one think of them (especially, Inuvik
veterans who had to live with them for 3+ weeks)???  Do they smell up the
van?  Are they easy to operate?  Are they worth the space?

Besides that I was wondering if there are any specific models/brands that
people are happy with.

Thanks,

John Brown
