it is what you can't see that they count on slipping by you.

having opened up a GEX rebuild that seized with less than 4,000 miles on
it and dealer trained mechanic installed and broke in, I found amoung
other things 

pistons from 3 DIFFERENT manufacturers (2 VW, 1 Mahle, 1 Cofap)
if that is installer caused I'll eat the engine!
(advertised &quot;New Set&quot; of pistons and cyl!)

. pistons out of balance by 9grams
. one connecting rod bent, two worn beyond spec
. cam at minimum spec
. leaked oil even standing still!
. two different styles of rings

this can be verified by reading the Judgement against GEX

District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City
Civil Case  # 0101-0025512-98

the pistons are still in my garage if you want to see em!

&gt; I'm not a big fan of any mass rebuilder of engines as I prefer to do my own. 
&gt; But I have to say that I worked on a 79 beetle this week with 3500 miles on 
&gt; a GEX engine. It was just driven here from Arizona and was running horribly.
&gt; After a couple of hours of fiddling with it I Managed to get it running most 
&gt; respectably. It was TOTALLY dry and all of it's problems were due to a bad 
&gt; installation and an installer that compensated for a basic problem[out of 
&gt; calibration decel valve causing a huge vacuum leak] by turning screws and 
&gt; changing the timing etc.
&gt; With the overly lean mixture, Too tight valve clearances,and the timing the 
&gt; way it was this engine was a good cantidate for an explosion. Doubtless it 
&gt; would have been blamed on GEX.
