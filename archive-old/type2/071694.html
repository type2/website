Subject: Cathedral City/Palm Canyon

I'm off on Wednesday on my annual winter &quot;quest to find the sun&quot;.

We are taking a loop down through LA then to Phoenix.  Enroute I 
would like to stop by Cathedral City/Palm Canyon near Palm Springs. 
My question is how much of the following URL jpeg is actually built:
http://home.earthlink_dot_net/~adamkrom/images/Palm_canyon_image.jpg

Does anyone have any directions on how to get there?

Thanks for your help,
