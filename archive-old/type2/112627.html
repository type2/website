Subject: R: [T2] propane powered type2's - any further info on this?

Here in Italy propane or methane power is quite common - most VW owners
consider the conversion to avoid the traffic blocking laws for uncatalyzed
vehicles.

GPL and methane cost almost half the same amount of diesel gas which is
already less expensive than gasoline - basically the car runs on both
gasoline or gas - you have a switch to go from the one system to the other;
only limitation is you have to finish one before passing to the other.

Don't forget, propane and methane pollute much less!!!
