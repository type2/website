Subject: RE: [T2] 34PDSIT carb parts needed

Hey Will,

I ended up with a huge box of 34PDSIT carbs and pieces from Durocshark when
he was cleaning out his garage. I gave them to Chris at BustedBus_dot_com  Tell
him about it and maybe he will send the box to you on the cheap.

Subject: [T2] 34PDSIT carb parts needed

Hi,
I've been asking around on FMBC etc. and I know I sent off a few sets of 
these stock dual Solexes a few years ago to a listmember, but I'm 
looking for a few parts to make a good set of carbs run on a 72 engine.  
this is a low budget project; I have turned out a few offers of complete 
sets of 34PDSIT's because I have a good set, just missing a few parts:

-choke element. (end of coil broke)
-peened in plug on top of choke assembly (is the bushing for end of 
choke vacuum shaft)
    (most likely will need whole choke assembly)
-O-ring for carb-to-aircleaner (1)
-small clip for end of choke override lever
-idle cutoff solenoid (has munged threads)
-dashpot (fell apart)

if anyone has a junk carb they are willing to part out that has this 
stuff, please let me know.  I have posted pics of what I need at:
