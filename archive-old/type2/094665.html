Subject: RE: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size? Halon

I read somewhere (I wish I could remember where now) that halon
extinguishers are nolonger sold except for very specific applications
(server rooms and boats I believe) due to the environmental impact they
have. It seems like all things that work really well end up being
outlawed for some reason or another.

&gt;OMG! i just read the rest of your post... i didnt realize it had been 
&gt;discontinued!!! CRIKEY! that sucks... they always take away the good 
&gt;things, man! oh well,

It is my understanding, that your local firestation will refill your
halon 
extinguishers.  Look around for a used one.  What's the concensus here, 
listees?  Who still has their halon extinguishers from the 80's?
