Subject: Valves won't adjust

Hello fellow bus fanatics,

I've been off the list for a bit and pleased to be back on.

I've got a problem with the INTAKE valve on number 3 for my 74 motor in my 
76 bus.  I could not get it to adjust because it was too tight no matter 
what I did.  I could see wear from the rocker arms hitting the ring on the 
end of the valve.  So, following the idiot book I shimmed the rocker 
assembly out with washers and was able to adjust it.. It tightens up fast.  
The symptom is backfiring on number 3 at idle, when I pull that sparkplug 
wire from the distributor it does not backfire.

My question is this: Why is this happening? Why the intake and not the 
exhaust valve? Muir says this happens after valves are ground sometimes but 
does not elaborate further.  What would make the intake valve seat lower and 
thus make the valve stem come out longer making it necessary to do the 
shimming?  I fear that I am destined to experience a valve tragedy.

Any thoughts, comments, advice,....solace?

'preciate it...

Jeffrey
