Subject: Re: [T2] Fag Bearings/India

Verified a few weeks ago that Porsche is supplying Japanese bearings as 
original equipment. I have seen many Bosch parts manufactured in Spain as 
well. I am looking over this stuff with a high powered hand glass and so 
far have seen nothing detracting from the standpoint of quality. Parts from 
new manufacturing in 3rd world countries has increased tremendously in the 
last few years. My impression so far is the parts are meeting German 
inspection specs. I have had no incidence of a functional problem with any 
of these parts thus far, except for the trashy ext. door latch handles for 
Rabbit etal. The original German items lasted 10-20 years. The new stuff 
fails typically in 2 years.

&gt;   What's this world coming to. I just received a shipment of FAG wheel
&gt;bearings, assorted numbers and was shocked to find that they are also made
&gt;in INDIA, in a FAG box at German bearing prices. What's it going to take to
&gt;know where our parts are made?.  So out of 10 different numbers this is what
&gt;countries they are from, Malaysia, Korea, India, Mexico and believe it or
&gt;not, 1 number is from the U S of A.

&gt;I will be posting a list soon of bearing numbers and the countries they are
&gt;made. This will include FAG, SKF, INA all supposedly German bearings and we
&gt;all know that SNA are from France.
