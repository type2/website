I bought a '68 camper about a year ago but have not had much tiime to spend 
on it because I go to school and work. It's been giving me a lot of problems 
and I really want to learn how to fix it myself. A friend told me a good 
book to get is &quot;The Complete Idiot's Guide to VW Repair&quot; or some similar 
phrasing. Unfortunately this book is out of print and I haven't been able to 
find a used book. I have a general book about my VW but it is difficult to 
read and understand. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions. I need 
something with good pictures and step-by-step instructions. I don't know 
much about VW's but would really like to learn.
