&gt; I own a 72 campmobile(1800cc, dual 34's) that has been spectacular.  I do
&gt; most of my own work but draw the line at carbeurators.  I took Buelah to my
&gt; somewhat trusted mechanic who told me that they couldn't be adjusted any
&gt; better.  He said that the connection between the carbs and linkage was worn
&gt; and there was nothing to do but replace them.  I'm sure somebody out there
&gt; has heard of this.
&gt; 
&gt; If I do indeed need new carbs, my gut feeling is to go with dual webers.  I
&gt; could sure use some advice.

Kurto:
If it's &quot;been spectacular&quot; why would you want to replace the expensive
German carbs with cheap Italian ones? Bus Depot has new ones if they are
truly shot. Rebushing the throttle bodies can be done by Rimco and
others, I believe.
