Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure sender

Jon,

I don't use a gauge(yet), but one of the first things I do when I
buy a vw is hook up a piezeo-buzzer from radio shack to the stock
oil warning light circuit....it makes me feel far safer to know
that I will get an audible warning signal as well as a visual
one if the pressure drops.

Still works even if the light is out too!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 	Those of you that have an oil pressure sender installed for a
&gt; gauge.  How many of you now do not have an oil pressure light (from a
&gt; pressure switch)?  Are you comfortable with that set up?
&gt; 
&gt; Those that do have a pressure switch operated light how did you plumb the
&gt; two sensors?  I love the way AUDI(also some wc VWs) does both oil pressure
&gt; and oil temperature with both on the oil filter mount.  Anybody done this
&gt; with a Type4?
&gt; 
&gt; Have any of you made a circuit that senses the oil pressure signal from
&gt; the gauge sender that activates a light at low oil pressure?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks. jon
