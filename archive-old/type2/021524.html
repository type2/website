Hey Karl,

Thanks for the pics. It looks like exactly what I need. Is it missing one of the
buckles that hold it closed? If it is I don't think it matters because I can
take one off my broken one. I do want to purchase it from you. You can Email me
direct with your address and how you would like payment. Also give me your best
guess how much I need to include for postage.
Thanks so much for helping me out,
Tom

&gt; I believe the front half is the same as later ones.....you just have the EEC
&gt; valve on it with a large [about 1/2''] hose going to the charcoal cannister
&gt; and a vacuum hose?
&gt; I just went out and took some pics.....may be dark, the sun is not up
&gt; yet.....
&gt; &gt; Hi Karl,
&gt; &gt;     I actualy have damage to both sides of the air cleaner but I am
&gt; interested
&gt; &gt; in seeing a picture of what you have. the price sounds good if I see it's
&gt; what I
&gt; &gt; need we will have a deal.
&gt; &gt; thanks for keeping in touch.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You just need the back section that the hose connects to and has the air
&gt; &gt; &gt; inlet on?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have that piece. It has slight damage at the tip of the snorkel. I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; take pics of it. $10 + postage from Fresno, Calif.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me know about the pics.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Karl,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You are right about the location of the air cleaner and yes I do have
&gt; FI.
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 75 cleaner also has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the preheater connection. I would be very interested in a good used
&gt; &gt; &gt; cleaner.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anything VW in N. Az. is rare and outragously priced. Any help would
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apreciated. If you are going to the yards please check and let me know
&gt; &gt; &gt; cost.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tom
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
