Subject: Re: [T2] disposable propane bottles-leave on or not?

FWIW my Weber and Sunbeam portable grills had leaky valves (and the bottle 
would empty itself slowly over a period of days) but my Mr. Buddy heater 
does not leak.

I remove all the little tanks after each use b/c of the lessons learned 
from the grills now.

However I recently bought the adapter hose to connect anything that uses 
these disposable tanks to a big barbecue grill tank. Now I just shut off 
the tank valve. Much more economical as locally they get $10 to fill a 
large tank (20 lbs?) and less running around for new tanks.
