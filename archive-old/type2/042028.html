Greetings:

Last week when changing transmission (manual) oil in my '79 bus I found
rollers and other bearing parts on the magnetic drain plug.  The local VW
dealer sells rebuilt trannys in two flavors, one with a 6-month warranty
and one with a 2-year warranty.  I am only interested in the 2-year variety
which they sell for $895 + $150 refundable core.  Doesn't sound too bad.
The dealer said that VW  contracts with &quot;German Transaxles&quot; of Bend Oregon
to do the rebuild work.  Supposedly, the 2-year warranted transaxles come
with new parts which are genuine VW where possible (like synchros).  With
all aftermarket parts of questionable quality out there, I would feel more
comfortable using a known rebuilder that uses parts that are known quality.
Something about chinese bearings in my german tranny....well you know what
I mean.

Anyway, has anyone had any experience and or comments relating to German
Transaxles???  I trust the list a lot more than I trust the dealer these
days when it comes to air-cooled parts and info.

thanx in advance
