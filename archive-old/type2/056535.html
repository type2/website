Subject: ?vanagon fiberglass bumper hit..

Yo Sean and any vanagon owners on this list:  while at Bussies by the
Tunnel I had the misfortune to back up in a parked/ready to go caravan and
bump a Vanagon (86?)- never saw him when I opened door and looked
under/around car because his his driverside was way over by my passenger
side corner.  he never honked....no big deal, right- well he said it was a
new &quot;fiberglass&quot; bumper, special order, $500 + $300 install with a grey
color and fake black &quot;bumper strip&quot;, not the usual chrome.  My 78 bumper
just pushed its paint, but he has an area a few inches across where the
fiberglass seems to have &quot;feathered&quot; on the &quot;bumper strip&quot; and a small star
crack below this about 1&quot; across. His  rear bumper looked painted metal
made, similar, usual scuffs.
I think he's buckin' for a whole bumper; I said I'd pay for a fill and
fix..is this easy?  Body Co. did a similar fix to a much worse Nissan Quest
deer hit bumper.  He already contacted my ins. co when I asked him to give
me an estimate first!!!  Aren't fibergass things supposed to bounce back?
Maybe it's a poorly made repro and he should ask for a new one?  Anyone
familiar with such repro's for vanagons?  He says you can't get the
original bumper anymore....  pissed in NJ
