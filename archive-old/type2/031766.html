&gt; I have a 76 Loaf with a siezed starter motor.
&gt; a new Bosch is $100. one from my FLAP is $60.
&gt; I can't shell out the scratch for the Good one, and i don't trust the cheap
&gt; one.
&gt; SO can my old 722 Bosch starter motor be rebuilted? and how difficult is the
&gt; process of rebiulting it?       Thanks   Gary VW

don't know where you are located but here in Baltimore there is a company
that rebuilds em, does a pretty good job, I've used em for over 25 years
and never had any kind of failure (gen, starters, alts.) but I don't think
they do mail order. and most everything is 24hr turnaround.  last starter
I took to them they went in the back room and came back handed me the
starter and said, no charge this one's good.

(I had just pick it up for a spare from a junkyard)
so check the yellow pages or ask around
