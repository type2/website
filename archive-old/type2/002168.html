Subject: almost on the road!! - Fuel injection question
Date: Sun, 4 Mar 2001 17:48:02 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

thanks to all those who offered advice on the spark plug inserts... i was
able to tap and put in a new insert just barely by taking the tin most of
the way off to give me enough room to access the spark plug hole...

so now i've got everything together and i'm having some troubles with the
fuel injection. again, i have a 75 camper with an 1800 fuel injection... i
took off all the FI when i did the spark plug insert so i could clean it
up... i'm not entirely sure i got the vaccum hoses connected properly, and
once i got it started i had a couple problems so i'm looking for advice...
first, help me make sure i have the hoses connected properly - so this will
be a bit long as i have to describe what i've done...

-i connected the fuel pressure regulator to the intake air distributor- the
left front of the air distributor (facing the engine, front is closest to
me) has two ports, one that connects to the vaccums assist hose for the
brakes, and another small one... this is the one connected to the pressure
regulator...
-the EGR valve is connected to the temperature valve thingy that is
hex-nutted to the crankcase under the left side intake rail... there's
another line coming from this valve thingy that goes to a t-fitting. the
t-fitting is connected then to the deceleration valve and the distributor...
the distributor has two ports on either side of the vaccum diaphragm
assembly, one facing the distributor and one facing out... the t fitting
(that is connected to the decel valve and the egr-temperature valve thingy)
is conencted to the port that faces away from the distributor... the other
port is connected to the throttle housing (in the port that faces front)...
there is another port on the throttle housing facing backwards that is
connected to another vaccum hose that goes through the firewall and connects
to the brake vaccum...

okay so you can see how i got confused... i have the hoses connected as
described above, and i'm fairly sure that they're correct... here's the
problem... when i started the van it started up fine once the fuel lines
were pressurized... once it warmed a bit (about 30 seconds or so... enough
for the cold start to shut off?) it started sputtering and eventually
died... i checked the distributor hoses and by pulling off the vaccum hose
that attached to the port facing the distrbutor body (the one that leads to
the throttle valve housing) i was able to get keep it running, but of course
the timing went off to about 8-T0 before TDC (and with the hose connected
and drawing a good vaccum the timing snaps back to 5 after where it should
be - running at about 900 RPM)...

so my question is how do i get everything in sync? i'm fairly certain the
mixture and speed adjusting screw have been futzed with (the guy i bought it
from said he played with them) and i'm not sure how to balance them
correctly without an analyzer...any suggestions?


thanks in advance for reading the long email!
