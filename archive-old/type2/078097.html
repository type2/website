Subject: Bolt of power for 78' 2.0 FI on Type 2

Was wondering if anyone had some ideas for bolt on
power for my 78' bus.  Has 2.0 FI.  This is a test
engine so don't hold back.  Have looked into the turbo
areas and was hoping maybe some others would have some
ideas. Thanks alot, you have all come through for me
many time.
