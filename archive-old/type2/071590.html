&lt;&lt; I am looking for anyone who might hve any useful infrmation 
about convrtig a 1961 VW bus int an automatic transmission. &gt;&gt;

Why?  Is it for medical/physical reasons?  Or you just want to?
You'll spend far more money, effort and time doing this than you 
would if you simply purchased a later Baywindow with an auto.
Probably decrease the resale possibilities and value as well.

Its your Bus so you can do what you want with it but I'd really
recommend that you do not attempt to convert to the automatic.

&lt;&lt;..I am also ordering a new engine as well probable from GEX. &gt;&gt;

Check the archives before doing so to see what other listees have
had to say about their GEX (and other mail order engines) 
experiences.
