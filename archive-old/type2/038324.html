Hi again,
Ok the I just found the nail in the coffin: I just finished draining the oil
and found enough scrap metal to forge a new piston! Bits and pieces
everywhere. I don't know how that thing kept running with all that crap in
there never mind whatever is falling apart! Most of it seems to be aluminum?
steel? but I found a few little gold pieces too, I also found a round washer
looking thing with a hole in the middle that's kinda ovaled out and
distorted. Any idea what this stuff could be from?

I gotten a few emails from people suggesting suppliers near Vancouver,
thanks for the help I'll need it!
Looks like my easter weekend plans are decided. : )
