Prayer for leak free windows and  sacramental roofing tar offerings :

Thanks to the Gods and Dinosaurs, who have given use roofing tar

you have blessed us in the winter
you have blessed us in the spring
you have blessed us in the summer
you have blessed us in the autumn,

I offer up this roofing tar to you, so thou shalt keep the water out of my 
Volkswagen in all seasons
I spread it thinly like Marmite on the lower window ledge before installing 
the glass with new weatherstrip.
let  the Holy Roofing Tar creep and seal between the rubber weatherstrip and 
the metal of the window ledge
let it repel the water
let it remelt next summer and creep again
let it repel the rust
thank you for this roofing tar, which can be cleaned up with a rag and WD-40
thank you for banishing the drip on my foot, which made my foot cold.
thank you for my leak free windsheilds

&gt;&gt;  I would appreciate your feedback on the topic of sealant.  There is a
posting from someone who said that a sealant should be applied.  I
understood that sealants were necessary or recommended, that the rubber
would make the seal if properly set on clean metal.  What's your view?  &lt;&lt;
