Does it still have a vacuum advance?  Let's hope so.

&gt; The engine has been rebuilt, and I've been breaking it in gently.  
&gt; Changed the oil and filter at 300 miles, and now am just over 400.

You are going to get lower mileage during break-in.  As the engine gets 
stronger, your mileage will improve.

&gt; Again, the vehicle is running great - starting right up and all.  Do 
&gt; you think some or all of these are affecting my lousy gas mileage?  If 
&gt; so, which ones are the most serious and need to be addressed right 
&gt; away?

I would start by making sure your engine is in-tune.  Do the procedures 
yourself, so that you know for sure.  Your AFM could also be out of 
adjustment... does it smell like its running rich?
