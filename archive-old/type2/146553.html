Yeah basically with the late model cars they jack into the ODB-II connector and see if the computer has anything to tell on you about. They also check the gas cap with a tester. 

For the older cars I don't know. I know it involves a tailpipe sniff for anything back to 1975. I don't know if that is a rolling date (next year will be 1976) or if it is going to be 1975 forever. Also they check that gas cap again. 

AFAIK Knoxville/Knox County, Chattanooga/Hamilton Co, Nashville/Davidson County and Memphis/??? (Memphis is in another state as far as I am concerned &lt;griN!&gt;) but don't quote me on that...
