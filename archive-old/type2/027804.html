Hi Folks,
  Speaking of starter problems this was recently said.....

   &quot;...A few gentle hits with a hammer or other suitable whacking implement 
on the side of the solonoid will generally get it unstuck,but
it will happen again,maybe tomorrow,maybe not for months but it may
as well be fixed properly as soon as you are able.  The final straw for me 
is when I have to lie down on a wet road on a cold rainy night and then I 
finally fix it right...&quot;

Like all of you I got tired of having to crawl under the bus at the worst 
possible time so I decided to do something about it.  I've had great luck 
preventing this from happening by servicing the starter once a year.  That 
way I get to deal with it on my own terms.  You know, at home in the 
driveway on a nice day, and in the daylight. I completely disassemble the 
starter and clean it inside and out, paying particular attention to 
electrical connections.  Any repairs that are needed are taken care of and 
then I lubricate the mechanical parts as I put it back together.
   At the same time I remove the battery and clean and service that.  No 
sense in putting it all back together without cleaning all the wire ends and 
terminals too.
   Hope this helps.
