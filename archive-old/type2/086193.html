Subject: More Ball joint/torsion arm Questions

Hello list,

I've been following the resent threads regarding ball joints. I just got the 
bus-boys torsion arm set up the other day and hope to put them on my '78 
Westy tomorrow (friday). BTW No core charge and and they look great. I too, 
have never done this procedure before and have some additional questions.

1)Do I have to do both sides at the same time? Is there some tension thing I 
am missing? Seems like I am (step 19 Mike Gensler, in Library)

2)My upper Bus-boys pre-pressed balljoints don't have the hex shaped 
&quot;eccentric ring&quot; on the upper ball joint. Should I be concerned?

3)Are the torsion arm seals NLA? Do they usually need to be replaced? And 
what about the needle bearing? (Bentley 2,18 Fig 7-16) Does a 78 have this? 
and is it NLA? or usually worn to the point of needing replacement?

4)Should I use anti seize on anything when I put it back together? Is it 
worth getting a socket that fits the ball joint nuts for proper torque? And 
What kind of grease should I buy? Brand, type?

Also, I ordered (Bus Depot) tie rods, all four shocks, all new brake 
pads/shoes and rear clyinders, front brake hoses, plus other stuff. Every 
rubber seal/boot in the front end of this bus is shot. Now I find myself 
wondering if I should do the front wheel bearings and swing lever bushings 
while I'm at it.

5)Would this make sense? (bearings, swing lever bushings)

I have no clue as to how many miles the bus has on it as the speedo was 
broken when I bought the bus in Feb (milage &quot;exempt&quot; on title). The bus was 
not well cared for either but, has no rust and will someday take the place 
of my rusty '79 westy. I want something that will last a long time, 
reliable....

6)Finally, any tips for the stabilizer bar clamps? the one with the slide on 
clip. C-clamp maybe?

Thanks in advance and sorry this turned out to be so long. I'm sure things 
will become much clearer when I start ripping things apart in the morning.

Thanks a million,
Brandt
