What kind of problems are you having.??

&gt;     I was wondering if any one had done this conversion before.  I need
&gt; info on axle lengths, tranny mounts, clutch cable tube, and anything
&gt; else.  I am running a 2.0L with FI.  Any help would be appreciated.

the auto and manual trannies and the way they go into a bus are so
different that it is a MAJOR project to swap.
 among other things
.  clutch pedal and mounting
.  whole gear shift mech
.  different mount to floor in front
.  linkage is different
.  accelerator linkage is different
.  front tranny mount is different
.  FI hook up is different (different black box too)
.  different drive shafts


per chance is your problem the fact that the 74 auto tranny has a vacumn
shift trigger and the 2L FI engine was used with a govenor shift triggered
auto tranny

it can be done, but IMO it is more trouble than it is worth, probably a
lot easier to get the auto tranny working right, or even switch to the
later model auto tranny which is stronger and works better with the 2L FI
engine and is almost a drop fit.
