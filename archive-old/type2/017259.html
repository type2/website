Subject: RE:Newbie heater question

I belive the flaps were to allow any extra air to flow into the heat
exchangers.  I am not sure what condition would cause the need for these
but VW saw a need.

I fabricated them from some sheet metal I had lying around and used a
piece of wire to make the hinge.  Pair of tin snips, and a pair of
pliers and away you go.
