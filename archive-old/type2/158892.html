Subject: Re: [T2] Cheap door seals from CIP

They sound just like the ones I got from Bus Depot in the &quot;complete 
front door seal kit&quot; parts numbered 82000 and 82001. Although they fit 
great and the quality appears to be good, the lack of a molded corner 
leaves a gap that allows the wind to make a _lot_ of noise at the top 
front corner. I will have to replace these with the better quality seal 
later.

All the other rubber was great, vent wing, inner/outer scrapers.

&gt; Cheap seals work fine, they just suck when compared to what's SUPPOSED to be
&gt; there. Without those corners you can get wind noise. The doors are hard to
&gt; shut for the first few months they're installed because the cheap ones stick
&gt; out more. But the cheap ones will stop the rain from getting in and keep the
&gt; drafts out. And those are the most important anyway.
