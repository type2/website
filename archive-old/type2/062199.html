Subject: End-play's effect on timing.

&gt; I need to do a rear seal and set the end 
&gt;play...You have already taught me about this in your sermons and I have the 
&gt;right tools...all of 'em...clock, seal installation tool (my neighbor bought

&gt;it from Berg).  Is the end play setting just a band-aid?  If this needs to
be
&gt;set, is my engine already senile and this is just life support?
&gt;
&gt;The reason I ask is that my timing jumps around about 5 degrees at 3000 RPM 
&gt;(.009 distributor). Will an endplay correction help this?

Tom,

Boy did I blow this one.  Nowhere in my articles have I mentioned the point
you've just made.

Firstly,  No -- adjusting end-play is not a band-aid, it is a vital periodic
maintenance item.  You need to re-set end-play each time you replace your
clutch-disk.  Eventually the thrust face of #1 main bearing will accumulate
so much wear you'll have to replace the bearings but by then the engine is
usually ready for an overhaul.

The point I failed to mention in my 'sermons' with regard to end-play is that
excessive end-play will cause your timing to 'hunt' by as much as ten
degrees(!)  This is because the timing gear on the Volkswagen crankshaft, a
steeply inclined bevel gear (the narrrow bronze gear) that engages the
distributor's driver-gear at a 1:2 ratio, is positioned so that any fore &amp;
aft motion of the crankshaft will be transmitted to the distributor's
driver-gear.  Even a small amount of end-play can cause the driver-gear to
lag or lead the actual rotation of the crankshaft by a few degress.  This is
multiplied by the fact the driver-gear is driven at one-half engine speed.
 That is, it has 12 teeth, the timing gear on the crankshaft has only six.
 As seen from the distributor's driver-gear, end-play appears to be rotary
motion of the crank, in that the end-play causes the driver-gear to rotate.

I have seen engines with end-play as much as .120&quot;, pretty far removed from
the .008&quot; maximum allowed (!)  All of these engines included erratic timing
among their other symptoms.

The engagement of the timing gear with the distributor's driver-gear is such
that, within the range of normal specs, the small amount of allowed end-play
will not effect the engine's timing.  Indeed, as wear accumulates, these
factors tend to balance each other out.  But when end-play becomes excessive
it begins to effect the engine's timing.  The wiser course is to keep the
end-play within spec, use a new timing gear at each  overhaul and so forth.
