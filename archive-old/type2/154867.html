Subject: RE: [T2] Timing Scales Good News

&gt; Just took a look at some new aluminum timing scales that
&gt; have become available. All I can say is (insert impressed 
&gt; whistle). I know the plastic re-pops from JustKampers are 
&gt; close to hitting the States, but these are niiiiice.
&gt; 
&gt; These are definitely a &quot;buy one, buy one for life&quot; item.
&gt;
&gt; I got mine through BustedBus and he is taking online 
&gt; pre-orders. Don't know who else will be carrying them, 
&gt; but assume our local list dudes will be shortly.


And you assumed right...
