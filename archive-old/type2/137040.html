Subject: Pulling a Vintage RV with a Bus

Doyt mentions frontal area as a concern. I don't believe that is really 
the biggist issue. Your bus has *most* of that FA covered (engi9ne has 
to push the FA of the bus anyhow) and airflow over the bus will divert 
over the trailer, meaning that you might add 20% (just a guess) to the 
rig's FA.

However, braking is a real problem; doubling the weight of the rig, even 
with electric brakes on the trailer, means you are driving a juggernaut. 
At most, you ought to be looking at teardrop trailers.

Go back to the driving stimulus for this notion and examine it. Is it 
rational? Hell no. Fix that and you'll not have to worry about doing 
something idiotic. Sorry for the non-politically-correct reply; I am not 
meaning to hurt any feelings, but at times only plain talk can clarify 
one's thoughts.

I believe a few thousand generations of humans existed right well 
without modern flush toilets :-)

Cheers, and hoping for a successful solution for you and spouse/The Fader
