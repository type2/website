Subject: RE: [T2] 15&quot; wheels

And what...  can't put the 15's on the 64-70?   I have a 70' and I would not
mind putting 15&quot; chromies on it...  otherwise I'll have to wait until I go
all disc and have them drilled out for a whole other type of wheel?

&gt; I don't suppose anyone has an extra set of five lug 15&quot; wheels they want
to
&gt; sell?

An extra set of 15'' wheels to fit what??

You have a 68? 69? bay, correct?  They only came with 14'' wheels. 64 to 70
is
14''.
63 and back split buses came with 15'' wheels.
