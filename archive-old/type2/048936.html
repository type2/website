I see these same buses being used by Federal Express as delivery buses 
in Laredo, Texas every once in a while.
They are Mexican buses that look just like 70 era buses, right down to 
the bumpers, including the rear engine air inlet, BUT they have 
radiator cooled engines.

It's pretty exciting to see these buses in Laredo being used for work 
duties; almost as exciting as seeing VW &quot;vans&quot; running all around the 
Frankfurt airport.
