Subject: Re: Cam regrinding

When you check a camshaft for wear, or just for your personal
satisfaction, one of the things to check is the lobe lift... The minor
dimension is taken across the lobe halfway from heel to toe. The major
dimension is taken from the tip of the toe to the heel.... subtracting
the two dimensions will give you the approximate lobe lift. 
	I *never* reuse a camshaft... new ones here are $75 and that gives me a
little extra insurance... worth it, IMHO.
	But, when a camshaft is reground, the priorities include taking off the
old wear, and then making the ratio of major to minor dimensions match
up to spec. With used cams that involves grinding a little more on the
areas that don't include the tip of the lobe... But there's all kinds of
things involved with the process that I don't yet know... that's just
the layman's impression. Hopefully someone more in the know will comment
on this....

&gt; What does this mean?  My understanding is cam's need replacing if they
&gt; wear is excessive, worn to much.  Also grinding removes material.  So
&gt; how can you regrind a cam, removing material, and increase the size to
&gt; meet original specs?
&gt; 
&gt; Or is this a &quot;cheap&quot;, you get what you pay for, cam replacement.  Price
&gt; difference was more than $40
