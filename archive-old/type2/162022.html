Subject: RE: [T2] Vacuum Hose Configuration for 1973 Bus w/ Dual-Carbs?

Thanks for the quick replies and the warm welcome!

I forgot to mention that I have reviewed:
	- The Bentley Manual (Green)
	- The Haynes Manual (Red)
	- John Muir's Book (Blue)
	- http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/VacuumHoses.html

All these resources are great, and have helped me get this far.
Unfortunately, the books are very vague on this topic, and the ratwell
site has a very different configuration than mine.

I'm hoping someone with the same engine can show me the way. :-)
