There's lots of those engines here in Australia as well. However, they 
may not be as cheap as you think. 

My daughter's small Japanese (rebadged) Nissan (84 model, 220,000ks) was 
using gallons of oil a week (well, a couple). Worn rings were diagnosed  
(I've never seen fouled plugs as bad as the ones that came out of her car). 

An in-car replacement of rings and bearings, head overhaul and radiator 
recondition cost her $A915 (bores were fine). A 2nd hand imported 
Japanese engine of unknown mileage and general condition (albeit with a HUGE
3 month warranty!!) would've cost $A650 plus $A300 installation 
(including freight from Sydney).

(Ken, sorry about lack of VW content but it's Friday here. Anyway,I 
thought as most of us seem to own, or know someone who owns, a Japanese 
car it might be of interest to the list.)
