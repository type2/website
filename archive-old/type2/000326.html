Hello busdrivers,

I took my '77 (1600 single carb) to a Veedub specialist today for a test and
tune-up (Hot Rod of Doesburg, The Netherlands).

Although the bus had recently been serviced by a VW dealer (it also needed
it's annual safety check) I did not like the way the engine ran. As I am not
very knowledgeable on these matters I wanted to have it checked by a real
air-cooled specialist.

I was very impressed. They went about it very professionally and let me
watch everything they did while at the same time explaining what they did
and what the results meant.

To cut a long story (I spent nearly 3 hours with them) short,

1) The engine runs much better, smoother, quieter.
2) I need to start saving up for a rebuilt as some of the data indicates the
engine is ready for it.

Here are the findings and their conclusion. What do you guys (and gals)
think?

- Compression was 105-120 psi (7.5 to 8.5)
- leakage test 40 - 70% (apparently this is bad)
- carb leaks around the small axle.
- valves were too tight, carb and ignition were not adjusted correctly.
   (readjusted and new points fitted)
- Engine has some small oil leaks (at the flywheel end).
- When adjusted properly CO was at about 5%, would be too high for our smog
test.

This engine has about 75K miles (not entirely sure) on it and had it's heads
replaced 10K ago. Nothing else was done at the time. Mechanic said that
rings and linings (???) should have been replaced at the same time.
Their advice is an engine swap. Sounds reasonable. They offer VeGe engines
(well known rebuilder in Europe). Now I know a lot of you will advise me to
do a rebuild myself. I definitely will not do that (I'm self employed so my
time is worth money, aside I do not think I can do it. Anyway I already have
plenty of things to do on this and my other buses as it is).

They offer two options 1) a long block and 2) a turn-key engine. The latter
is complete with new carb, heaterboxes, exhaust ... the lot (Mexican engines
not available here). I am tempted to go for this option although it's not
very cheap (equivalent of $2500 to $3000 fitted, with new clutch disc).
Warranty is 12 months and I know they are good for it. The long block is
cheaper but then a lot of stuff must be taken from the old engine which
means extra work at $50 per hour and you still have the old stuff (like the
carb).

This amount will not ruin me financially but of course I can spend each
dollar (in reality Dutch Guilder) only once. So I'd like to plan this for
the coming year rather than do it now. So what do you think? Can I stretch
the current engine's life for another 3000 miles or so? Performance is still
good. I'm mainly worried about a sudden total engine failure. Well of course
you never know with cars this age.

Well, I hope you're still with me.

Thanks in advance,
