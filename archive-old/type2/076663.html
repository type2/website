&gt; 
&gt; To the list and Ken, I have been unable to fill the back orders and had
&gt; since months ago refunded all order and offered discounts to all that never
&gt; received their orders on the chance of future orders.  I find it amazing
&gt; that I can still stir up such commotion since it has been close to a year
&gt; since I have finalized all order that I can still stir up your list ( your
&gt; list as I have removed my self after 9/11 and the continuance of negativity
&gt; on this list).  I wish you all well and only want to finish my recovery and
&gt; get back into my passion, my business and on with my life. If individuals
&gt; want to speak up for me it is on their own accord and I have no influence on
&gt; that.  I have heard of recent post on the list and have not started business
&gt; back up yet nor made any deals with anyone.  When I start my business back
&gt; up I will limit the amount of orders and product to start and move very
&gt; slowly as I will be almost starting from scratch.  I appreciate all that
&gt; have stood behind me and those especially that make me feel as though they
&gt; have stood behind me.  Thankyou and until next time...............
&gt; 
&gt; Dawn

&gt;&gt; Jennifer,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; In the nicest possible way, understanding that nobody wants to revive some
&gt;&gt; very ugly threads from days gone by, because that would not be
&gt; constructive
&gt;&gt; at all:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If you are going to be recommending Dawn's work on the list, and referring
&gt;&gt; to her &quot;line up&quot; of customers, then we need to know whether the back
&gt; orders
&gt;&gt; in that lineup have been filled. Because at one time there were quite a
&gt;&gt; number of people who had sent money in advance and had nothing to show for
&gt;&gt; it long, long after.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We understand there were some devastating personal problems, whatever they
&gt;&gt; were, and of course we don't want to embarrass the lady by reciting those,
&gt;&gt; but we do need to know that the back orders have been filled.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The vendors who have survived on these lists understand that they are
&gt;&gt; subject to constant, intense surveillance because of the nature of this
&gt;&gt; medium. (That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger--some of them
&gt;&gt; understand this medium so well that they can consistently turn a flame
&gt; from
&gt;&gt; the odd dissatisfied customer into a PR opportunity, and come out looking
&gt;&gt; better than before. It's really quite a phenomenon and I admire them, like
&gt; I
&gt;&gt; admire the 'nads on a brass monkey. 8^ )
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We need to know whether Dawn's back orders have been filled before we can
&gt;&gt; have too much talk about her (celebrated, undeniable) skill as a
&gt; seamstress.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dawn doesnt NEED to TRY to sell anything to ANYONE~
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dawns work stands out with a shine and a shimmer of quality handcrafted
&gt;&gt;&gt; seamstress work, and the line up of customers that are waiting to fill
&gt; thier
&gt;&gt;&gt; order after thier friends friends grandmas get thier work done, should
&gt; show
&gt;&gt;&gt; for the backing of her work.
&gt;&gt;&gt; good-day
&gt;&gt;&gt; *jennifer
