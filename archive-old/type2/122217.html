Subject: RE: [T2] Workshop Equipment for Local Manufacture 

RE:  I am looking for one of these VW only publications covering 1968-1979
buses. Found one on thesamba_dot_com but it was copyrighted in the late
1950's


Hello... If something was copywrited in the 50's, it was probably printed in 
the 50's.  Very futuristic to cover the 1968-1979 buses back then.  Possibly 
a 'first edition'   Was it signed by anyone we know???
