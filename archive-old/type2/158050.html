Subject: Re: [T2] 2000cc rebuild!!!

&lt;&lt;Nothing can be more frustrating than a non fuctional AFC system---&gt;&gt; 

&lt;&lt;True but why does it have to be that way...&gt;&gt;

That's why I mentoned it Richard--
If it's true--forget about it.

 &lt;&lt;Why are we always comparing a set of (new) dialed in carbs to a
malfunctioning FI setup?&gt;&gt;

No,
Lets do this;
Compare a screwed up FI system, and a screwed up points, condensor, carb
system.

They both happen to stop dead on the side of the road in the same place
, the same time.

I'll file the points, saftey wire my choke open, and be down the road
while your still scratching your head why you have no go.

&lt;&lt;Just go over the parts, testing them, fixing the PO and his mechanic
abuses, make sure the electrical contacts are good and you'll find it's
reliable.&gt;&gt;

Like I said--your still on the side of the road--I'm gone.

I think I'll trade the hour or two a year to keep the earlier system
running right, than to be suprised and on the cell phone calling AIRS or
the tow truck--


&lt;&lt;The points and condenser are not part of the FI system.&gt;&gt;

Right again--
Thanks for understanding that.

&lt;&lt;I have no fear of driving 2,000 miles in my bus because I've put in
the effort to make sure a 30 yr. old bus is road worthy enough to get me
to the destination and back.&gt;&gt;

Good One .

This is the kinda stuff the travel agent was telling the folks that went
for their first boat ride on that unsinkable ship.---

They had no fear either---

Glug----
