Subject: Re: poptop seal

Sounds like you might have it on backwards  :(  The beveled edge faces out and
to the rear, away from the luggage rack, allowing the deeper groove to seat
onto the poptop.  I installed mine with no adhesive just to see if it would
stay put, which it has, other than some minor contraction at each end.  If it
does come loose at some point, I'll try a dab of Gorilla Snot (I have seen the
real thing and the consistency is similar  :P ) here and there to tack it back
in place. I'm surprised your main seal came out too short; I had at least a
foot extra to lop off of mine.

&gt; Ok list today I got the new seals I ordered from Bus Depot .. Im not sure if
I
&gt; installed it correctly as mine was non exisitence. Does the bevel go
&gt; towards the front of the bus?Do we use glue to make it stay on tight? All
&gt; the other seals are nice and tight any advice?
