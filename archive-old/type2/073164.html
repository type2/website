&gt;The heat of vaporization provides a hysteresis loop that should allow
&gt;for intermediate positions of the thermostat.  Since heat only flows
&gt;&gt;from hot things to cooler things, the opening outlet temperature has
&gt;to be a few degrees higher than the closing air outlet temperature.
&gt;If the air runs a bit warm, the thermostat opens a bit.  If the air
&gt;cools off a bit then the thermostat closes a bit.

I don't understand why this has anything to do with it except that the
thermostat doesn't open/close at the exact boiling point of the alcohol--I
still maintain that it will be either open, closed, or in process of
opening or closing.

In order for the thermostat to sustain a state of being half open, the
alcohol has to sustain a state of half boiling--doesn't it? And that
doesn't seem very likely.

I was not able sustain a half-open bellows using a pot of water, which is a
much more controlled environment than the ass of a moving bus.
