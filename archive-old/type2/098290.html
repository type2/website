Subject: RE: 78 FI

 Sorry, that is 35 lbs when the pressure regulator uncovers the outlet
and returns fuel to the tank. I just plugged the fuel line to the
pressure regulator and turned the motor and got 80 lbs pressure, no leaks
on the injectors or cold start. Pressure very slowly leaked down to 40
and slower to 30 and seemed to stop, released plug to regulator and
pressure went down in 3 to 5 seconds.Do you think the regulator is bad.

        TIA
        Ralph  78 westy
