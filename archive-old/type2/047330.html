&lt;&lt; hey volks,
 just a quick question.  someone emailed me after
 looking at my website and was inquiring about the
 ariba puck campers.  seems he has just picked one up
 and wanted to know more about them and how they were
 popular with the vw bus folk back in the day.  does
 anyone know of any websites on line that mention these
 or have any info on them.  im curious as well.  i know
 i saw something once but cant remember where and an
 initial search came up with nothing.  can anyone help
 me out?
 thanks

I don't know of any website about the older models, but you can still buy the 
Eriba Puck &quot;Classic&quot; model which I had a chance to check out a couple of 
weeks ago in Germany.  If I can find an easy program that will allow me to 
make thumbnails of the pics, I'll post them to my website for all to drool 
over.

Go to one of the German search engines and search for Eriba, or Puck.  Most 
German sites have the de at the end like www.eriba_dot_de 

You may have better luck if you spell &quot;Eriba&quot;  correctly.

I think the Puck was popular with the VW owners, as it was light enough that 
you could tow it with Bug.
