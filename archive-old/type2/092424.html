&gt;Never.

It's true that the service manuals and parts are available but the dealers don't want them for two reasons:

- they don't have the special tools anymore
- the mechanics they hire right out of technical college have never even seen one let alone fixed one.
- what happens when they get half way through and then require a NLA part?

I got this straight from the service manager of the local dealership when I was chatting with him.
