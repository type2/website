&gt; Sounds like a solution we need to homebrew!!! More
&gt; power, better emissions, better fuel efficiency...
&gt; Think we could do it for less than $14K?

I'd like to see a controlled, independent test of this concept.  It takes
as much energy to liberate hydrogen via electrolysis as it returns when
burned.  From the description in the article, it seems like just another
perpetual motion machine.
