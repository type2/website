&gt; If you're bound and determined that you don't need the thermostat, just make

OK, I have rebuilt my 78 and have all the flaps in and working but I have
not put the thermostat in (different reason, read on) and they are sprung
to full open

&gt; &gt;I am also going to S*** Can the covers and ducts around the heater 
&gt; &gt;boxes, as well as plugging the blower outlets to same, and the 
&gt; &gt;electric blower ducts...here hoping this increased air flow will help 
&gt; &gt;keep some of the cracks out of the 'new' heads...
&gt; 
&gt; This is another really bad idea unless you are running pipes with no heat
&gt; exchanger boxes.

I have also done this, but I have totally removed everything on the
exhaust pipes, &quot;J tubes&quot;  (left the tin between the cylinders).  The
reason I have not put the thermostat back in is that I am concerend that
without the heat exchangers and lower tin it will not get hot enough soon
enough and may cause an overheat problem.

(no I am not in S. Calif, I live where it is cold but my entire heat
ducting system was shot and I put in a Eberspracher, worked so well I
don't need the stock unit, so it was cheaper and easier to can it and just
use the gas heater)

any comments or suggestions as to wheather or not to hook up the
thermostat.
  I do have a sump oil temp guage and it says everything is fine, has
never gone over 240 and that was when the engine was first run and real
tight.  now hovers around 220 on hot day at 65mph much lower around town.
