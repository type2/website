Subject: ? to clean pitted headlight glass covers

At the Terryville (Connecticut) VW show/swap meet this past weekend bought 2 
Bosch driving lights for $5.00 in which the front glass lenses were really 
pitted (actually looks like they were sandblasted).

I read somewhere that there was something you could apply on glass lenses 
like these to make them clear again. Anyone know what the stuff is or another 
method for &quot;shining up&quot; pitted headlight glass protectors?

FYI: at the show there were a lot of buses FS. Everything from:
1976 from Colorado, no rust, running fine for $1,600 (but it wasn't there to 
look at... why do people do that advertise what seems like a fantastic deal 
but the car/auto/bus just isn't there to check out    huummmmmm....)
1970 &quot;with only 6,000 original miles&quot; for $6,000. Had a rebuilt engine...
owner's girlfriend blew the original one on the way to a Pish concert... 
things just didn't add up on this one. 
1982 with rebuilt engine and aux heater for asking $1,500... I'm sure the 
owner would have or did take less.... after talking with him he worked at a 
local VW dealership in the service dept. rebult engine really looked fine.

Lot of really nice splits in the show. Up here in the northeast (spelled 
rust, salt, corrosion, and body rot) they seem to be coming back especially 
at the shows.

thanks

Greg
