Subject: Hella dual battery kits are back!

Importance: Normal

Just a note that the Hella dual battery relay kits (part # 1738) that were
much-discussed on the list recently are now back in stock, at the same
$18.95 listmember price.  These genuine Hella kits include the relay,
wiring, and instructions for adding a second, aux battery to your bus or
van.  After some positive remarks about the kit by a Vanagon listmember who
happens to be expert on the subject (he's an engineer at a leading battery
manufacturer; see the archives), listmembers quickly bought all of my
remaining inventory. I now have more, and will be filling all backorders
tomorrow, with extras available for anyone else who needs one.  As always,
you can order via the website, or toll free by part number at
1-888-819-DEPOT.
