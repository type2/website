Getting the firewall out turned out to be fairly easy--I lifted the wall
up to 30 some degrees, put a tire iron up near the top, using the rim of
the inspection hatch for leverage, pried gently and it slipped right
out.

Now I can see the sender. There's no way on earth I can get my skinny
little wrist back there. I assume that I've got to unstrap the gas tank
and wiggle it forward (what an adventure!).  I've been crawling around
under the bus for a while now &amp; can't see how to unbolt the gas tank
straps.
