&gt; And even if you listed everything you could possibly think of that may be
wrong---somethig else mght break--and an unhappy camper is born---

Hence my caveat that &quot;It's everything that I personally know is wrong with
the vehicle&quot;, and the big upper-case &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;NO RETURN&quot; on the bill of
sale.

They sell a lot of used vehicles down here, so it's rather accepted that
there's probably going to be something wrong with it when it's sold.  It's
just my own thing to be someone honest enough to fill you in before you buy
it.
