&gt; There was a small red diesel tractor being driven around the camp.
&gt; It was made by Porsche in the 1960s with the logo script on the side
&gt; in silver paint. How times have changed.   TGIF!

Hello Guys   Not so fast  porsche makes most of its money doing research and 
delvelopement for other companies including farm and air crafts, besides cars 
. They made a couple of models of tractors in the late 60's. just as there 
were VW tractors  A company call Butietiz  (SP)      or something spell like that 
  had a 40 hp motor mounted in the front, look a lot like the international 
Cub  but not as high in the air.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
