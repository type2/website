Hi Volks,

I'm just about to tune up my '72 for the first time and am buying the parts
and tools I'll need.  I looked at timing lights and saw they ranged in price
from $44 to $250. Ouch!  What am I looking for in a timing light?

I have a special service manual for my 72 that says I need a Synchronizer to
synchronize my dual Solexes.  Where would I get this thing?  Is it
necessary?  How about linkage clamp?

Is there a good resource for understanding how carbs work, particularly
Solex's?  Bently is happy to tell you how to remove or install one, but
doesn't say how to tune one or what does what and why.  Muir has always been
a bit enigmatic for me since he tries to cover seemingly every model and
year in the same paragraph of text.  I'm working on our only 'running'
vehicle we have and so I'm pretty nervous.

BTW what edition of the many many Muirs is favored?

I'm still working on getting the groundwork for a NW VW coop together, but
it's hit the back burner since Karen quit her job, my kitty got $250 sick,
her Bug died, etc.   Sounds like life, huh?

If only I could just get one GOOD handhold, maybe I could pull myself out of
the tempest and into the storm.

TIA
