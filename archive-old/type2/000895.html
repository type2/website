Subject: leaky windshield
Date: Thu, 15 Oct 1998 09:35:14 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello all:
I recently replaced the windshield seal on my '70, yet it leaks at both
corners. Someone else had this problem, as I recall. What's the solution?
The seal seems a wee bit off at the top corners, but I pushed and prodded
and swore until I was blue in the face and couldn't get it in all the way.
Thanks
Bob
