Subject: 79 Westy seatbelts

Hi, people,

I'm Roger up in Vancouver, B.C. (new to Type 2 list), and after reading the
many good posts in the archive on this subject, I am pretty sure I am about
to order retracting shoulder belts from J.C. Whitney for my 79 Westy.

I'm asking for specific comments on any difficulties with the Whitney
belts, or any other&quot;retro&quot; efforts, pitfalls to avoid, etc.  My main
concern is the driver's seat, as the metal retaining wall behind the seat
confines the amount of available space for the retractor unit.  I've
already checked out (on a rumour!) VW Rabbit belts, which in the 4-dr.
models could work in my bus.... but, being a lazy sod and all, I would
prefer a more &quot;perfect&quot; solution.  Also, ordering from Whitney assures a
new, snug belt, which will fit all sizes of people.  Using a set from a
sedan means losing a certain amount of belt, due to the greater distance
between retractor and wall attachment.

I don't know how many years of VW vans had the metal wall behind the seat,
so I guess my questions are open to quite a few of you.  (I'm quite new to
the VW milieu, after many many years of being a Westy wanna-be!!  .... and
I'm loving it!!)

Thanks, everybody.  This list (and web-site/library/archives/etc) is a
fabulous resource!  I sure appreciate being able to use it.
