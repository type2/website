Subject: Front door question

The front doors on my 68 Westy are NOT mirror images of each other..
just wondering if someone knows which is original, and what year the
other may be. The driver's side outer handle has a &quot;pull&quot; type button
inside the handle, and the lock on the inside is located above the door
open handle. The passenger door has a &quot;push&quot; button on the outside, and
the inside lock is on top next to the window. I'm inclined to think that
the passenger door is original for a 68, but I could have it
bass-ackwards. What do y'all think? Thanks!

Jon
