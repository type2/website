Subject: Theft prevention for VW-logo

I don't know if this has been a subject before. I was just considering
how to prevent my T2a VW Logo from being stolen (the one on front). It's
not a chrome one but still. Has anyone ever thought about this? It seems
rather easy to rip it off. Perhaps there is some simple way to prevent
this from happening.

I have a plastic logo on my 1977 bus, but since it's made of plastic I
don't think someone is willing to have it. They are quite cheap on
meetings.
