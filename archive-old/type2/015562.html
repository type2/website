Find the brown wires running to the headlights and head light switch.
Follow them to their terminus. Make sure the connection is clean and tight.
Verify batt cables and their terminals are likewise clean and tight, and
don't forget the ground strap from the front of the tranny to the chassis.

When that's confirmed, then verify charging at the battery under load, both
at idle and 2000+ rpm.

At idle with the high beams and the heater blower on, at idle should
certainly be more than 13 volts, at 2000+ less than 13.5 indicates a
weakness. And since you've already verified the grounds, you know the
weakness is in the generator/regulator, assuming also you have load tested
the battery and it is in spec.

You will need a good quality DVOM to test the battery/charging system. Bad
data can be very expensive.
