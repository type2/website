Yeah, sorry about that.  I've been reading this list (previously
vanagon_at_lenti) since May a year ago, and had never seen anyone
describe this problem.  Of course, one month ago today, I was lying on
the beach in Mombasa soaking up the rays beside the Indian Ocean,
pleasantly unsubscribed from the list and not fretting it.  So there!
