Al and the List,

Following Dave and Al's words of wisdom, I took the negative lead for the 
relay off of the coil and put it to chassis ground.  Runs just fine.  Now the 
only thing hooked to the (-) or #1 terminal of the coil is the negative lead 
from the Compufire module.

Found the source of my leaks.... pushrod tube seals.... had a nagging feeling 
that I should have replaced them before putting the engine in the bus..... 
sure would have made my body less contorted today.  Pulled the valve covers, 
rocker arms, pushrods and tubes.... did them one side at a time, reinstalled, 
(getting the little wire just right takes a bit of work...especially to keep 
it out from under the rocker arms as you bolt them back down)  Torqued the 
rocker arms, set the valves (cold) and buttoned it back up.  Found that the 
rockers were a bit stiff on the shaft, so cleaned them up.... fired it up and 
it runs pretty good.... idles to fast, but that is another trouble shooting 
to do.

Thanks to all of the list for the suggestions and advice.  I hope this will 
be useful to others searching the archives in the future.
