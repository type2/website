Subject: Re: [T2] Kerosene:

Here it is picked up by a recycler at checkers and pepboys.  I think the 
same one services autozone.  Rolls up with a truck  and slurps away.

&gt; Not to defuse a brewing flame war, but Auto Zone will take just about 
&gt; anything besides nuclear waste, no cost to you. There is a big tank 
&gt; back there by the overhead door, they'll show it to you and ask for 
&gt; your phone number, and some idea of what you're dumping on them.
&gt;
&gt; There are now smallish generators built for the sole purpose of taking 
&gt; the offal from car maintenance, heating it up, and turning it into 
&gt; electricity. Co-generation; the utilities are required to buy the 
&gt; electricity back.
&gt;
&gt; I hope that is what Auto Zone does with it. Can't say for sure.
