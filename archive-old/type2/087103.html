Subject: Broken lock...

So today I went out to open the dirvers side door on my bus. The lock has 
been sticking for some time, but I have not had time to do anything about 
it. Anyway, I turned the key and the lock opened, and then removed my key, 
and about 3/4 of the lock came with my key. Is there anything to do about 
this besides replace the handle?

Thanks,
-Nick
