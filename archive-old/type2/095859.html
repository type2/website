Subject: Re:won't start still - help! 

 
--Ref: Bentley fuel injection chapter, pg. 8, test #5

Knowing that t50 on the solenoid is a stud requiring a circular lug connection, and t30 is a spade connection, why is bentley so concerned with mixing up the connection?

Furthermore, against the wishes of the special note on page 8 mentioned above, I have power to terminal 86a of the double relay when the key is in the #2 position. The note says it should only be there when key is in #3 position, but the pump wire (red/white) is on terminal 50 per your post.  ?

thank, I'm learning a lot here,

One more: I have a 1&quot; sq box mounted on the frame near the solenoid with 3 big red wires coming to it. I'd guess it was a hot start relay, but it seems originally fixed to the frame?

&gt;Circuit 15 is key on power.
&gt;Circuit 30 is key off power.
&gt;Circuit 50 is starter engage power.
