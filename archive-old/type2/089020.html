Subject: Rubber steps for 70 front bumper

I took off the two rubber steps for my front bumper, and got the bumper
sandblasted and repainted. Now, I tried to install the stock rubber steps
back on the bumper. Lo and behold, they won't fit at all. They are the stock
items, with VW part numbers. They seem to be about an inch too short. The
rubber is not stretchy at all. I am wondering if I have to buy new ones.
Maybe 32 years in the sun have shrunken them. Wonder how good new ones would
be. Has anyone on the list dealt with this problem successfully? Tom
