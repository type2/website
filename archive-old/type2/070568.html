Subject: part plee

Hey everyone.
I want to make a pee (not sure if its cool to to it or now) for a 
part if anyone has one they can send me free (ill pay for shipping) 
or one cheaper than $42 new from bus boys. Its number 211-843-3697, 
its the center roller for the sliding door, it mounts on the arm and 
runs the track.
http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/slidingdoor79.html the part is &quot;C&quot;

I recently lost my job (not trying to get pity) and trying to get my 
bus back on the road since I have some free time while looking for a 
new one.
thanks.
todd.
