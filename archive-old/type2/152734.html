Subject: Re: [T2] Head Part number

You're the winner of a cylinder head for a Wasserboxer Vanagon! &lt;grin&gt;

As far as sending the wrong part back to the supplier to exchange for the
correct one, it's pretty much the standard practice with most suppliers in
the auto parts world and you should be refunded that shipping cost.  Some
places will even send a replacement/correct part, but require charging you
for it again and then refunding you (to include the return shipping
charge[s]) when the wrong part is received back to them.  Just to send a
replacement item out at no charge (especially something as expensive as a
cylinder head) and trust you to send the wrong item back immediately just
isn't done in this day and age.

If they've got internet, take a digital pic and email it to them.  Maybe
that will sway the argument in your favor.

I ordered from a bus supplier part number 043101355CK &quot; Cylinder Head
Brand New, stock 1600cc Dual-Port&quot;
What I received was a head with the following part number stamped on
it: 025101375CK, its also got &quot;AMC&quot; cast into it, it also looks
rebuild..
&lt;SNIP&gt;
From the previous description can anyone confirm for me that this is
indeed the wrong part? The supplier wants me to ship this part back
before they resend the correct part - because they want to confirm
they sent me the wrong part first - I think that's just outrageous.
What do you think?

Thanks
