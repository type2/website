&gt;I am trying to get some heat out of my '78 bus.  Could anyone provide me
&gt;with a diagram to show me exactly what components are in the heating
&gt;system and how they fit together.  What is I believe is the heater
&gt;control flap has three outlets.  One of these has a piece of old hose on
&gt;it but I don't know where it is supposed to connect.


Those third outlets should connect to a couple of &quot;tailpipes&quot; which carry 
some heat away from the engine area when the heater is off.  If they aren't 
there, it's not life or death, but they would keep your engine a little 
cooler, especially when driving slow or ideling.

The rest of the heater system is straighforward.  Heat exchangers connect to 
flapper boxes which connect to plastic bellows which connect to the heat 
ducts which come together to form a main heat duct.  There are two outlets 
going into the camper and one going into the cab.

Good luck,
