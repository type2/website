Subject: Shuddering problems...


So, I just got the bus out of the shop out of 4 months worth of work (body
and engine). I've run it for 2 days (less than 4 half hour drives) and it
has run like an absolute dream.  Until yesterday. About 45 minutes into
the drive home it starts shuddering. It does it mainly if I have the gas
pedal down a ways. If I push it to the floor, it gets worse. If i let up
on the gas, it stopped for a bit but eventually started up again. These
were pretty good shakes too. Lurches more like.

So, I pull over. Pop the lid and ewpsie, looks like someone forgot to put
in the duct work for the blower (I normally check the work any mechanic
does, but this time I was so amped to get the bus back I forgot). Not only
that but it was kinda hot in there. Even the bumper was hot. I let it sit
for 45 minutes with the lid open. It starts up fine. I drive the 2 miles
home with no problems what so ever. Start it up this morning. It idles
fine.

Here is what got done during the 4 months (after the thing sat for 4
years). New ECU, New AFM, New Gas tank, New Axle Beam, tune up, timing,
oil change, new injectors, new fuel lines, new hoses.

It's a late 77 bus with a 78 engine. I'm thinking the obviously missing
duct work (duh) and a new fuel filter might fix it. Any other things I
should investigate? Electrical maybe?
