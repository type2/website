&gt;  the continuing saga of trying to get this 78 2l engine running again...
&gt;
&gt;  have been going very methodically thru the EFI trouble shooting guide.
&gt;
&gt;  what &quot;appears&quot; to be the problem is the injectors are only intermittently getting the trigger signal to fire,
&gt; when they get the signal the engine runs, when they don't it doesn't.
&gt;
&gt; ok, so &quot;Why&quot;???
&gt;
&gt;  on pg 11 of the manual I get to &quot;no triggering impulse from coil terminal 1&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &quot;test light does not flicker&quot; when connected to term 1 of control unit.
&gt;
&gt;  I get the impression the light should be off and flicker on.  but it is on and does not flicker off or
&gt; anything else.???

&gt;
&gt;  .breaker not adjusted or defective.  ??
&gt;
&gt; also it is happening intermittently ..
&gt;
&gt;  ???????
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; A &quot;suppression condenser&quot; is not the ignition condensor. It is a static suppresor for the radio.On older US
&gt; cars, it mounts to the side of the coil.

oh!

&gt; Are you running points or electronic ignition?

normally a crane electronic ignition but currently removed with points
installed in place of Crane.

&gt; If you are running points and the trigger signal to the ECU is
&gt; intermitttant; you have dirty/bad point contact.

ok, will check and double check, unfortunately since I normally use
electronic ignition I only have one set of points, gotta find another set
or reinstall the Crane which I had removed to eliminate one ??? from the
equation.

thanks

Bob
