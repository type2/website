&gt;      You know, my experience (5 yrs in LA) was that there really aren't 
&gt; much in the way of specialized yards, at least in LA. Why? Because 
&gt; there's so damned many bugs and busses running around that the regular 
&gt; ol' salvage yards have 'em. Seems like it might not be cost effective to 
&gt; specialize when all the local yards will beat your prices. Dunno if 
&gt; that's why there's no specialized yards or not, but it could be.

I would say the same thing goes for the San Francisco Bay Area as
well, although splitties are starting to get pretty scarce.
