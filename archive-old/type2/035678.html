Subject: Re: OIl pump o-ring

Clark-
         Metro Rubber at &lt;http://www.Metrommp_dot_com&gt; lists o-rings by size. 
Also any
large plumbing supply house should have a large selection as should any Hot 
Rod or
Racing shop. O-rings can be mic'ed and a size ascertained. The parts store 
you went
to probably wanted a parts #- not an unreasonable request, really- but armed 
with the
correct size, any of the above should be able to match it up. &quot;Odd&quot; usually 
translates
to not obvious in the parts book...
