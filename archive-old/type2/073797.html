Subject: Touch-up paint

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://paintscratch_dot_com/&quot;&gt;http://paintscratch_dot_com/&lt;/A&gt;

Someone posted a question about touch up paint a while ago.
I bought a set of dove blue from Touch up paint.
I was easy to find on their site &amp; they seemed to have all paint from VW in 
the 50's &amp; 60's.
They delivered promptly and I got both paint in a bottle &amp; a spraycan. I also 
got wet &amp; dry &amp; an overcoat paint,
I guess that the real test will not be the paint but my skill.
