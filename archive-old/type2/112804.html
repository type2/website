&gt; ok so i think i maybe just rewired it wrong here is my impression of 
&gt; what it should be.  The black and yellow hot wire goes straight from 
&gt; the horn to the fuse box. The brown wire is supposed to be in two part 
&gt; one running from the horn button to a nut underneath, and the other 
&gt; brown running from the horn to some unknown to me spot on the column. 
&gt; Correct this please if im wrong, but if its right please tell me where 
&gt; the horn brown is supposed to connect to. At the moment i have it 
&gt; wired black and yellow to fuse, and one brown from the horn to the 
&gt; horn button


according to the wirng diagram it is as follows

1.  brown from horn to nut underneath  

2.  brown plugs into horn button.  look at this picture i found of a 78 
when i was searching for stuff about my horn. 
 http://webpages.charter_dot_net/bclausen/How_to_files/ignSw/img2.gif  yours 
is a little different but it is the same priciple.  it has to plug in 
somewhere.  btw this was taken from this web page. 
http://webpages.charter_dot_net/bclausen/How_to_files/ignSw/ about taking 
out an ignition switch

3.  your  black and yellow wire is right.  (goes to the fuse box.)

A COMMON PROBLEM IS CORROSION BETWEEN THE WIRE AND NUT UNDERNEATH THE 
STEARING COLUMN.  just make sure everyhing is clean down there.
