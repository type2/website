Subject: Trip to Vegas Anyone?

Well, I got really bad news today from my local VW mechanic.  My '76 FI is 
need of an overhaul.  I haven't talked to them in person, just over the phone 
with lots of background noise.  All I got was words like valves, block, 
camshaft, pistons, compartment seal....all for $2800.

So it looks like I will be spending Spring Break getting a crash course on how 
to rebuild/overhaul my engine.  I have ordered the Wilson book and it should 
get here next week.

Since this is my first &quot;real&quot; mechanical journey beyond the Muir tune-up, I 
will probably be posting a great deal of questions as I go.  But, if any of 
you are planning on visiting Vegas between the 17th and 21st and can pull 
yourselves from the Strip, I will be more than happy to feed you if you wanna 
lend a hand.  After I talk to my wife, I may even be able to offer you a bed 
for a night or two...big maybe ;-)

Otherwise, is there anything I really need to know ahead of time about this 
engine in general before tackling this.

I guess my first question is: Will I be able to do this in one week?

Thus the adventure really begins...
