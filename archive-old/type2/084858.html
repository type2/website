Subject: Re: [T2] towing question

I've done a few hundred miles with a towdolly.

Disconnect the half-shafts if you like. I didn't but would in the future to 
be sure I don't ruin a tranny. There are things spinning in there that 
don't normally spin much without the engine running. In other words some of 
those shafts might not get enough lube but what exactly I don't know.

Lastly - be sure your tow vehicle is big and heavy. A bus can start pushing 
you around on downhill slopes.

I prefer a flat tow or all four tires off of the ground given my druthers.

As far as disconnecting the driveline - it's a 30-45 minute job on a bad 
day... 1 tool.

&gt;I need to tow a 74 bus from Ohio to NC. Assuming I have no
&gt;special equipment, which I don't, what is the best way to do
&gt;it? I called a rental place, and they said a tow dolly couldn't
&gt;be used because the &quot;driveline is too hard to disconnect&quot;. They
&gt;suggested a trailer (all 4 wheels off the ground). Yea, nay, bogus,
&gt;or right on?
