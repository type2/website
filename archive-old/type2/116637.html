Subject: RE: [T2] Wood Interior

i used 'door skin'.  it is some type of luan (sp?) product available at
builders supply.  essentially it is 1/8&quot; plywood made out of some tropical
wood.  worked great!  just make sure to cut it a bit smaller than the
original panels b/c it is not as flexible.

steve

&gt; 	I am thinking of doing a wood interior for my 71 bay window
&gt; bus. Does
&gt; anyone have any clues where I can start. I have done multiple internet
&gt; searches to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
