Subject: Missing Exhaust Studs

After finally finding a source who could special-order a 9mm helicoil set, I
spent last evening removing the heat exchangers and exhaust manifolds. A real
pleasant job! Amazingly, all three of the missing stud holes were OK. I ran a
9mm tap to clean up the threads--only one had the first two turns a little
rought, but they all cleaned up fine.

I used locktite on the new studs and they turned in and tightened up fine. I
was able to call back to the parts place this morning to cancel the order. I
discovered that with the manifolds in place, there is not enough length on the
stud when you put a nut on the end to turn it and to tell if it is going in
cleanly or not.

So what I thought was going to be a tedious job of doing three helicoils
turned out to be a messy job of RR of the exhaust system. I'm gaining a real
appreciation for the simplicity of the bus design. Much easier to work on than
other old vehicles I've worked on.
