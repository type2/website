Subject: [T2] fried wire update

For all who voted bassackwards give yourselves a star.  I checked the 
archives and my Bentley diagrams and then went out to the bus.
Darned if the ignition wire wasn't on the #1 terminal with the condensor
wire.  Big boo-boo. 
So now it's on the correct terminal(#15) along with the back up lights
and the choke/carb cutoff. Woo-Hoo!

Now, I'm going to get a new condensor, but have I ruined the coil?  At
least it was the old coil not the new Blue Coil:)
