Subject: Re: [T2] torque converter

&gt; I don't know what the technical terms are for the parts involved but on 
&gt; the end of the crank there is a plate about 2&quot; in diameter attached 
&gt; with 5 torx &quot;like&quot; bolts (some of which are stripped) in the center. 
&gt; Around the outside edge there are holes through which the flex plate(?) 
&gt; was attached with pins or rivets. The flex plate is then attached to 
&gt; the torque converter with 3 13mm bolts.
&gt; 
&gt; The pins/rivets sheered off, does anyone have any parts or do you think 
&gt; it would be safe to weld the flex plate to end of the crank?

flex plates must be ballanced try to find another one, I may have a spare
in the garage, where are you....  don't lose the 3 13mm bolts they are a
unique part and cannot be interchanged with others.
