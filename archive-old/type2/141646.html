Subject: RE: [T2] General BD tent questions and floor vs no floor
  question

&gt; I am getting ready to place an order today for a tent from
&gt; The Bus Depot. I thought this would be an easy decision, but
&gt; I am struggling to decide.
&gt;
&gt; I am looking at these 4 tents.
&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details/tents.jsp I was thinking that the
&gt; top one would be the best since it was the cheapest. But, my
&gt; wife wants a floor. So the next step up is the model with the
&gt; sewn in floor.... another $100. One option is to get the
&gt; cheaper one and get the add on room with ground sheet.


In my opinion, the $299 Hamburg tent is the best value for the dollar. While
the $199 Koln is great for the price (and many list members are happy with
it), having a floor and/or sleeping cabin can be really useful (especially
when it rains!), and by the time you add that you're at $229. For $70 more,
the Hamburg has the sleeping cabin, plus an actual sewn-in floor - but also
it's a bit better constructed and has an improved design/layout. In a
nutshell, there were fewer constraints because we weren't trying to hit an
under-$200 price point. It's worth the extra $70 in my opinion.
