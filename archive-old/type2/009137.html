Howdy folks,          What is in your opinion the best product to use for
repairing tiny 
                    holes in the muffler and heat exchangers that is
paintable?  Is it JB Weld?  Or will something else work better?  Or is
there one product thats better for hot metal, and another that works best
for the heat exchangers?  What kind of results can I expect?

                                   Thanks,        Kevin  Snow
