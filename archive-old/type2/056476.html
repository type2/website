Subject: VDO gauge mounting?

I am going to install a VDO oil pressure and temp gauges in my '70. Where
should I mount them?

I am not sure of the underdash mounting as it would seem to me that the
spokes of the steering wheel will interfere with viewing the gauge. Has
anyone cut holes under the radio mounting hole and put gauges there? It
seems to me that would be a good place to see them and they would look
nice.

The downside: I have to cut holes in the dash. I am worried that the
padding on the dash will show and the cuts will look like sh#t.

So, where you got your gauges?

Bonus question: who out there has mounted their oil temp sender in the sump
block off plate meant for the type 3 oil filler? What kind of readings do
you get? What VDO sender did you use?

Many thanks
Bob
