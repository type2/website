Subject: Westfalia Insurance

I was wondering if anyone could help me out. I'm having a heck of a 
time finding someone who will insure me for my 79 Westfalia. I have 
given them terms like type II, Westfalia, Campmobile, camper, but 
they are unable to insure it. Can anyone tell me who they are insured 
with?

thanks.
todd.
