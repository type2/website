Subject: RE: [T2] bridgestone dueller A/T tires

Paul,
I had these on my '72 Westy hardtop. They were great. Even quieter on the
highway than the passenger car tires I took off, surprisingly. Great
traction in snow and mud, look great. Fantastic improvement over the old
tires, but that was to be expected. I'm putting them on my new van. Thanks
for the heads up.

&gt; Costco has these onsale- 195-75-14 load C.  $240.00 plus tax for
&gt; all four.  Can any recommend these tires from personal experience
&gt; for my westy?
