Subject: 75 bus fuel injected

Well I have had my new moter in for a few weeks now and dont have alot of time to work in the bus.  My problem is I cant get the bus to idle well I set it for 800 rpm and it surges to 900 than lowers to about 600 -700 rpm.  I do hear what sounds like a fant vaccum leak in the area of piston #1 but have been unable to locate it even when using a spray bottle.  Please give me a hand if possiable as I am about to give up!!
