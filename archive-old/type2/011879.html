We used to use a fisholene (fish oil derivative) product in our exhaust
systems.
Pour it in with pipes off the motor, rotate, swing around etc,  and cope
with the smell and smoke for a while, great stuff, no scientific data on
results but worked for us and others.
Now I will galvanise all such from new. Much better than stainless too IMHO.
cheaper, not just a surface layer like the powered coated system I did
recently which could not handle the water/mud immersion of off road use
firewooding.
Check out what the power boaties use, with their environment of heat,
vibration, hot salt water and sulphur, galvanised exhausts outlast stainless
steel especially at the welds.
