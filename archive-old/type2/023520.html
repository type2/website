After i rebuilt my 79 2.0 FI engine (my first VW), i was unsure about my 
thermastat adjustment. I just left it it as it was and put it back together. 
It doesnt seem to take an extended period of time to heat up, or get too hot, 
but i'm kinda concerned with getting it to propperly opperate. The nub that 
the cable attaches to on theflap bar never seems to move. I can move the 
flaps very easily by hand, but i cant drive at the same time. Can anyone give 
me some hints as to what needs to be done.
