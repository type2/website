&gt; In the Idiot Book, Muir talks about a gasket under the flywheel. On page

&gt; holes in it. It's in place? OK.&quot;
&gt; I can't locate this gasket w our usual vendors, is it generally reusable?
&gt; Thoughts?

On a '71, the seal is an o-ring, not the 4-hole gasket.  the O-ring lives
in a groove in the flywheel that is sometimes hard to find, particularly
if the old o-ring is silver in color.

&gt; There are two replacement discs available, one described as rigid and one
&gt; described as spring. I'd appreciate any guidance as to which is appropriate.

The spring one is better for smooth engagement.

&gt; I plan to take the advice of the list and thoroughly seal the tin at this
&gt; time. I see there are two ~2&quot; holes in the engine lid, under the license
&gt; plate. I've never seen them mentioned here. Are they supposed to be open or
&gt; plugged?

Never seen this.  There should be no air passages into the engine bay
except for the side vents.  Plug 'em
