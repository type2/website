Subject: Re: [T2] Hidden Danger in Low Mileage Tires

Correction, these tires had a single load rating of 1876 lbs. and were 
185R14C

Learned something interesting through all this. The max pressure rating 
on the sidewall is NOT the recommended pressure rating. The sidewall on 
the Merits lists 65 PSI max. I had been inflating them to about 55 PSI.

Bentley, however, recommends 30 PSI front, 40 PSI rear for radial tires 
on a van up to 3/4 load.

Doesn't that sound a little low?
