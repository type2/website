Here is some info about a pretty good deal I found on tires for my '76 
Westy recently.  They are the correct size and load rating, and have a 
max load capacity of 1710lbs (Westy really loaded down).

I got them at a Firestone tire center.  Any Firestone should be able to 
order these tires, and presumably at the same price I got.
