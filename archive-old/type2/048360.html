&gt; Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; Are we talking about the same part ? , the part i am
&gt; replacing has two part numbers on it, one on each end,
&gt; 113 255 358D, 211 255 358.  When I do a search for
&gt; that part at the bus depot it comes up with nothing ?

I went to the main search page (not the by part number search page) and
asked for 72-79 Bus heat &amp; coolant systems...the part you seek is between
the heater control boxes and the control levers.
