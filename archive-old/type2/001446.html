Hey Don...

I had a really difficult time figuring this out myself...And have only done
so recently..

The way I've got this set up:

Plug the manifold vacuum port.  Mine is on the aluminum intake manifold that
comes right out of the block.

I run the vacuum line from the front of the vacuum canister to the rear port
on the carb.  This was the old EGR port.  I believe the left port has
something to do with the idle set screw, although I'd have to consult the
manual to be sure.  Mine has been blocked off, so there is only one rear
port.

I run the vacuum line from the rear of the vacuum canister to the port on
the side (left) of the carb.

Try this setup and see if this helps.  I presume you've tested the vacuum
diaphram on the dizzy to make sure it's working...

Let me know how it turns out...

Tom

Hi Tom

My carb is the stock one, 34PICT 3 or 4, I'm not sure which.  There are 2
vacum
ports on the carb, both on the back side (RIR).  The old EGR valve (it is
now
plugged) is connected to the RH one and the advance side of the vacum
advance is
connected to the LH one.  The only other vacum port is the one on the
manifold
below the carb and I'm positive the retard hose was connected there when I
removed the stock distributor.  I'm sure the EGR connection has always been
on
the RH port on the carb.  There is no other way to connect the hoses.

I don't think the vacum  connections are the problem.  What I'm trying to
figure
out is why does the No. 1 cylinder fire at TDC with the 009 and the engine
runs
fine but with the stock dizzy, no. 1 has to fire at 28 deg BTDC for the
engine
to run good.  Both of these conditions are at idle, about 800 rpm.  I know
that
I cannot run the car with the timing ranging from 28 deg BTDC at idle to
about
50 deg BTDC at cruising rpm.  The only difference in the two conditions are
the
distributors.

I'm definitely confised.


Don
