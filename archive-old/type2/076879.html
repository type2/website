&gt;Dave,
&gt;  The stuff is really smelly and it takes awhile to dry. It was four days
&gt;before I re-installed mine. I also took my wife
&gt;hair dryer(she even offered it to me) and put the dryer on low and stuck it
&gt;in the fuel filler neck.

I did Casper's last April, and did the whole fuel tank thingy.
The POR materials work great, and I am quite pleased with the results.

To hasten drying, I hooked up the (SUCTION) side of my shop vac so as to 
draw air through the tank.
as in:    http://freeweb.pdq_dot_net/perring/casper/tanksuck.jpg

I fit the fuel gauge sender hole with a filter made out of an old pair 
panty hose so as to not suck anything into the tank.
