First of all, VW did not give up on the idea of a 1600 pushing a loaf.  In
fact, all current loaf production is pushed by 1600s!  I'd strongly
recommend that you stick with the stock displacement.  If it works in the
Sierra Nevada, it'll probably do just find in the UK!

Second, the work you describe can be done by anyone with the ability to
read and follow directions.  Get a couple of good books (Tom wilson's for
example) and you'll have good info.

Time...  Well, the project will expand to fill all available time!  Figure
on at least a couple of weeks for a firat time job.
