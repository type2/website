Subject: Engine Problems after Tune Up Updated 2

Couple of the replies I got suggested that I might have knocked off a 
vacuum hose.
I went back and checked and there is only one hose going from the 34-pict-3 
carburetor to the advance diaphragm
on the distributor. However, I noticed that the center section of the 
manifold (under the carb) has two
blocked-off inlets (or outlets?). They are covered with a bolt and what 
seems to be gasket sealant (red rubbery stuff).
The rubbery stuff in one of the caps seems to be broken... I'll try to 
reseal the hole and see if it makes a difference.
At this point I haven't touched the carburetor and the bus was running fine 
before I decided to do the tune-up fiasco.

Thanks,

Rogelio
