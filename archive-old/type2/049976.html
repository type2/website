Subject: [T2] Re: Paint and body shop in No. CA

If the whole vehicle needs to be repainted, the most economical way to do it 
is with a nationwide franchise chain that focuses on that type of service. 
The independently-owned body shops really only want to deal with individual 
panel damage and localized repair, rather than complete paint jobs.
I reached that conclusion after needing to have three panels of a '91 VW 
Jetta repainted due to burn-through of the glaze coat. I checked with a 
regional sales manager for a large international paint company  who I had 
met, and he agreed that was the only way to go because the hourly rates at 
the independents and the way that they are organized makes the &quot;chains&quot; much 
more efficient. He concurred that MAACO was cut above Earl Scheib and 
Miracle, so we took that advice. The result was quite satisfactory, costing 
about $950 including a small bit of body work, and special preparation of 
the three panels. This was for the Ultra Urethane (&quot;integrated&quot; glaze coat), 
next to the most expensive package. A van will cost a bit more. I doubt that 
you can get an independent shop to repaint the van for under $2000.
To get the best job, remove the trim that comes off easily: door handles, 
lamp housings, antenna, bumpers. That is the sort or thing that chains just 
mask off, rather than remove, as would the independent shops which is 
another reason why the cost is less.
