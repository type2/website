&gt; Hey everyone,

Rus,

The first question is:

&quot;Why are you rebuilding?&quot;

Is this just a convenient time for an overhaul?
Do you have low oil pressure at idle?
Are you planning on splitting the case?

Here's a list from the Engine(General) section of the library:
http://type2_dot_com/rvanness/1600reb.htm

Rough list (off the top of my head)
==========
If not splitting the case:

P&amp;C's
Rod Bearings
Main Bearings (crankshaft)
Push-rod tubes
Heads (or new exhaust valves if not rebuilding the heads completely)
All appropriate seals
