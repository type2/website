&gt; What is the consensus about the wisdom of replacing the wire harness?
&gt;
&gt; I have my '72 stripped down for sandblasting.  The only thing left is
&gt; the front part of the dash and the wiring.
&gt;
&gt; The metal tube under the bus that encloses the wire harness is just
&gt; about completely gone.
&gt;
&gt; If the wiring was gone, I would probably completely remove the entire
&gt; dash.
&gt;
&gt; Are the wire harness products currently available recommended?  Or
&gt; should I endeavor to preserve the current harness?  Leaving the
&gt; original means not replacing the metal enclosure, most likely.
&gt;
&gt; To be honest, I am underwhelmed with the wiring on the bus
&gt; altogether.  I have engineered scientific instrumentation that is far
&gt; more complicated and I am sure that I could do better, I am certain,
&gt; however, that I am not the only fool who thought that.

just be aware in the past 35 years your bus has probably had a lot of &quot;Non
standard&quot; wiring repairs that are probably not documented.  I'm an
engineer (not electrical) and I tremble to think about taking all the wire
out at one time, when I replace I pull a new replacement wire, disconect
the old one BUT NOT REMOVE IT. and plug up the new wire. drive for a bit,
then if everything works I remove the old wire....
