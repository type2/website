Subject: FW: [T2] Determing Tranny Age

Right, but there are finger style pressure plates for earlier buses now =
too and don't the -70 year trannys have the sleeve on the pressure plate =
fingers while the 71 year uses a sleeveless pressure plate and the =
bearing attaches to a special sleeve?

Are they interchangeable regardless of the year? My understanding was =
that they were different and not interchangeable. =20
