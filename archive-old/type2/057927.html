Subject: Re: tech manuals for Solex and dizzies

Just out of curiousity, does anyone have a copy of the a book titled &quot;Solex
Single and Double Barrel Down Draft Carburator Manual&quot; (or something like
that).  RMMW (back when it was the Bus Stop) advertised this manual in their
1994 catalog for $9.95. When I called in 1996, they had stopped selling it
and didn't have any info on the author or publisher.  I'd be interested to
hear from somebody who has a copy.
