Subject: Re: [T2] Heat

Steve:
Respectfully disagree. The post referred to in the archives was possibly mine.
My 69 double cab has a heat tube in it made of 2&quot; PVC schedule 40 DVW. Even
though I've not driven it recently, I do believe it is still quite intact. It
was nearly a slip fit and some latex caulk caulk made it fit air tight.
I also did a similar fix on my 78 with a piece 3 inch fastened in with the
clamps that held the BA-6 when my BA-6 finally rusted through. When I junked
it out I put the 3 inch DVW pipe back on the shelf to resume its intended duty
later removing waste from a toilet. It was not melted in any way.
Next time I'm over at the shop, I'll lay under the 69 and double check.
BTW, I never noticed the PVC making any smell, but it's been a couple of
years.
I really doubt it gets over 200 degrees F. I think PVC will stand at least
that much-
I've bent a lot of it with a heat gun before.

&gt; &gt; 2. PVC was not made to handle the temperatures that the heat exchangers
&gt; &gt; are capable of producing.  Outgassing problems might rear their ugly
&gt; &gt; heads.
&gt;
&gt; As I said in my post, I am with George... PCV will not stand the heat.  It
&gt; will melt if your heater boxes are pumping and the system is tight.  Dunno
&gt; about the outgassing, I can't smell it over the cigarette smoke, but the
&gt; sagging and melting I can see :-)
