Subject: WHO'S GOING TO VOLKS FAIR JULY 18TH IN INDIANA?

Who from the list is planning to attend this show.
It is all air-cooled, on the lawn and in 2 1/2 weeks.
Check out the website at www.NEINVWClub_dot_com.
You can download a show flier at the website too.
Our club is sponsoring the show and would love to have a showing from the
VintageVW list!
Hope to see you there!
Duane Miller
