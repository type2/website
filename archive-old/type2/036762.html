Subject: Re: wacking the starter motor..?

This very thing happened to me while on a 5000 mile vacation this Christmas.
I was able to get it starting many times by whacking on the solenoid.
Sometimes it wouldn't turn the engine over no matter how much I whacked it.
On those occasions I'd push start the bus.  When I got back I replaced the
starter solenoid and it works almost all the time now.  And when it doesn't
I just sit and try and again and after the 4 or 5th turn it spins over.
This makes me think it's just a bad spot on my starter and when the solenoid
kicks it and kicks it it finally turns past this bad spot and takes off.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ... he asked if I had a hammer
&gt; &gt; in the car of which I had and gave to him.He then went under the
&gt; &gt; van and whacked the starter motor , and asked me to start the
&gt; &gt; kombi  and to my surprise it started.
&gt; &gt; ...
&gt; &gt; At the first chance I had I bought and replaced the brushes and
&gt; &gt; cleaned arond the commutator ...
&gt;
&gt;  It's not the starter motor itself that's playing up but the solenoid
&gt; that activates it. this is the smaller cylinder attached to the big
&gt; motor part. When it gets hot it's sticking and so there's never
&gt; any current getting to the actual motor.
&gt;
&gt;  Try cleaning the solenoid, rather than the motor. You may even be
&gt; able to replace just the solenoid, depending on which year bus you
&gt; have (after the mid-seventies they don't appear to be available
&gt; seperately).
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; W.
