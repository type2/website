Subject: most excellent fresh-air vent cover

During one of the many desperate discussions on bus
heating, a list member passed along the tip to put a
strip of magnetic sign material over the front grill
on the bread loaf to block Ol' Man Winter's icy
fingers.

A stroke of genius.

I stopped at one of those quick sign places and they
cut me a 5.5&quot;x36&quot; piece of gloss white magnetic
material and even rounded the corners for $13.

It looks like it's a permanent modification. (My only
fear is some #$_at_&amp;!&amp; will rip it off in a parking lot.)
