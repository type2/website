Subject: Strange readings on Oil Temp Gauge

Oh oh!!

I'm driving home down I-20 today, and hit a nice spot of rain. So, me 
thinks, lets see what it does to the temp! It was running aroun 200 or so.

I pass a few big ol' trucks, and begin to turn towards my exit.  As i 
slow down i look at the gauge. just above 120! whoa says me! Musta dumped 
alota water back there...poor little aircooled musta drowned! 
Anyway, i continue slowing, and gaue continues to drop! As does my jaw, 
since i KNOW it didnt get that cold!  So, methinks, maybe the oil 
pressure droped. I shade my hand over the oillight, and nope. nothing. 
&lt;maybe sender causing light to not work right? re: last nights question..&gt;

Anyway. I stop, to make my turn, and The needle runs back up to 120. till 
i put my foot back on the gas. Then the little bastard starts jumping up 
to 180, 210, back to between 180 &amp; 120 etc. Quite eratic. So's i continue 
on home, and the needle continues to do the same. I get to my driveway, 
get out, and the engine sounds a little louder. hmm..

Pull in the fence, park it, and sit down to ask:
WHAT THE HELL!?!

anyway,

thanks...
...david
