Subject: RE: [T2] fusebox/battery

&gt; Has anyone ever tried to rig a second battery to operate say...radio,
&gt; lights and other such things?


I sell an inexpensive Hella relay kit designed for just that purpose - part
number 1738, for $18.95.  It is very similar to the relay setup that was
factory-installed on Westfalia campers that came with dual batteries.
Installation instructions are included (although some knowledge of
electrical wiring is presumed).

You hook up your accessories directly to the second battery (via a fuse or
fuse block). For best results use a deep-cycle marine battery (available at
most auto parts stores).  When you are driving, the accessories run off of
your alternator just as they do now (and the second battery trickle-charges
from the alternator as well).  When you shut the engine off, the accessories
run off of the spare battery, which the relay isolates from the starting
battery so that even if you kill the spare battery completely the bus will
still start. A very simple and inexpensive, yet functional, way to add a
second battery, which is probably why Volkswagen themselves did it that way.
