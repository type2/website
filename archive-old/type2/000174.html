&gt;  I have a 73' Bus which runs fine in the summer but as winter starts and 
&gt; the
&gt;  temp falls she gets harder to live with. Although she starts well and idles
&gt;  on choke for 3-4 minutes she then stalls. When I restart she needs to have
&gt;  some gas to keep ticking over. If I warm her up for 5 minutes or so and
&gt;  drive off she stalls when I take my foot off the gas. She can take over ten
&gt;  minutes before she is warm enough to idle, she also tends to die on 
constant
&gt;  gas and will need reving.
&gt;  
&gt;  I live in Southern England and I need to use the bus for work 5 days a week
&gt;  but at the moment she is such a pain to use in rush hour traffic that I'm 
at
&gt;  the end of the line. If anyone can give advice, and stop me having to keep
&gt;  reving, it would be appreciated.

Hi Gareth,

Well you don't say what sort of engine you have or what carb(s) - my 
experience is with 1600 type1 engines but princibles apply accross the board. 
And you may have a 1600 anyway

Speed of warm up is controlled by the choke -  is there a good electrical 
supply to it? Is it adjusted correctly? is it simply broken? Consult your 
Haynes manual for procedures of adjustment. 

To assist with warm up and running when cold there is a hot air supply from 
the air blown over the #2 piston barrel into the air cleaner to provide warm 
air to the carb. If you've taken the oil bath air filter off and fitted a 
paper filter to the top of the carb then chuck the paper filter away and put 
the standard system back.

Do you have a standard exhaust - many of the after market systems do not 
connect up the input manifold preheat tube correctly so there is no exhaust 
warming of the input manifold. The preheat tube can also get clogged and its 
a _at_%$!* to unclog - tons in the archive on this.

Are the thermostat and flaps, present, connected and working? If not then you 
will be cooling the cylinders when the engine is cold, so prolonging the warm 
up time.

Is the coil good? as week spark may be OK when the engine is warm but no good 
when its cold - likewise check the points, condensor, and timing to make sure 
you are good in those departments.

As I've been writing this my memory has been whirring telling me I had this 
happen to me too and I've eventually remembered what cured this FOR ME The 
bushings of the lower (throttle) flap in the carb had become worn - when I 
decellerated, particularly going down hill, the flap would behave differently 
from when I did a tune up while stationary - the solution was a new carb.

If you have vacuum assisted brakes and the problem only occurs while pressing 
the foot brake then look for a vacuum leak in the brake lines.

Good luck
