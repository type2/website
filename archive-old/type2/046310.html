Now, this is a first for me.  Why would you want to move the battery to the other side - to rot the other tray out too? 

Replacing that right battery tray 'the right way' is a bear, i know - but with the inspired use of some alternate materials - wood, plastic, fiberglass, foam, tape - whatever - - maybe you can seal it up *and* provide a surface that will if not absorb the corrosive leakage of the battery at least repel it - they do make those 'battery pads' that are supposed to suck it all up.

Some of my tray was still there - enough to at least support a custom-cut piece of 3/8&quot; plywood in there and i use split foam pipe insulation around the perimeter to seal it.  True - i didn't give it alot of attention and it may leak a little (one of the things i need to get around to) but it is a hell of alot better than it was and my left tray will stay pristine.

Just my unsolicited 2 cents - if you move it over to the left, make sure that you take steps to prevent what happened on the right side - and make sure the right side gets sealed up  -big air leak there.
