&gt; After rebuilding and installing my fuel injected 2.0, i have run into a

&gt; couple of minutes before it starts up again.  I have already ruled out the 
&gt; possiblity that i cant drick stick, where do i go from here?

check the plug on the AFM, might be loose, sounds like what happens when
the AFM isn't communticating
