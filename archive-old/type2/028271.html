Hi All, 
A fellow listmember has offered to sel me his old oil cooler setup off of a 79 2.0L to fit to my 82 westy vanagon 2.0L.  Below is a description of what he is offering, and I would like the list's opinion as to whether or not this is the ideal setup for an aux cooler.  I am not familiar with the engine compartment setup on a 79 and how it differs from a Vanagon, so will this work or do i have to modify it?  Here it is:
&quot;The set up was on a 79 2.0 liter air cooled motor.
It consisted of an evaporator coil from a 75 MonteCarlo made by harrison
with female 1/2 npt aluminum collars welded on each end for the AN 8
fittings for the hoses.  I had a thermostat in line with bypass that would
open at 165 and be full flow by 185.  if you don't like those numbers, the
valve is made by Amot and they have interchangeable guts so the valve sill
work in many differnt temp ranges.  The hoses are Aeroquip Aircraft quality
stainless steel wrapped teflon hoses good to over 400 degrees.  The remote
filter was a ford and the engine lasted over 100k before the rebuild.  The
water cooled engine is the one tyhat's real picky about whicvh filte it
gets.  You can buy a Bosch filter for a Ford if you want!! My cooler sat
flat in the driver's side of the engine compartment with an air box and
scoop around it so its heat didn't get recirculated in to the enigne's
cooling fan and negate the initial cooling of the oil by making the heads
and cyl run hotter!.  This system really worked well.&quot;  
How does that sound?  Would I be better off with a electric fan assembly under the slider/pass side of van?  Any input greatly appreciated!
Thanks
Mike 
82 westy
