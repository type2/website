Subject: [T2] Gas Heater Parts

I just purchased a plug from Ark last week  ( have yet to receive it). Looks
like he knows what he's doing.
Below is the message he sent when I inquired about a plug.

Hi,
I do have several brand new original German spark/glow plugs in original
 boxes.
 Yes, they are pricey, $80 each (shipping included). However with the plug I
 send an instruction of proper use.
 The instruction lets you know what affects plug's performance and how to
 extend plug's life.
 I have many customers bought heaters from me or periodically ship heaters
 for inspection and service .  .
 At this time I have sale on the following items for your heater:
 High power electronic ignition kit ..............$110
 Electronic fuel control kit               ...............$100
 Electronic 3-program (7-day) NEW German  timer-clock-calendar-thermometer
 (all in one small unit) for heater automatic start and shut down (vehicle
 warm-up) ...................$105

 Kits shipped prewired for in-minutes changeover. You will never worry about
 points and will have practically maintenance free reliable heater which can
 be tuned to emit up to 25% more heat at efficient smokeless combustion. Ask
 for details.

 Payment method - money order or cashier's check issued to Ark Mirvis and
 mailed  to the address below.
 Kind regards,
