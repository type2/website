Subject: RE: Subject: Source for 2L heads?

&gt; Someone pointed out a few months ago that the vast majority of heads
&gt; coming out of AVP and MSHP have been welded. He further claimed that this
&gt; reduces the life of the head well below that of a new head.
&gt;
&gt; For the longest head life, the best route to go may be to get the new
&gt; heads from Spain (at about $400 a pop) and send them to Marc Stephens for
&gt; the valve seat treatment.
&gt;
&gt; But be aware that even Marc Stephens isn't perfect. David Schwarze and I
&gt; have both gotten unsatisfactory heads from MSHP. Inspect thoroughly!


I can't comment on Stephens, whom I don't deal with, having been scared off
by their core policies (see the archives), an issue that I have _never_ run
into with AVP.  If there has been a failure of an AVP head, I have not heard
of it (in that I sell them and have never had a single warranty claim on
one, nor have I had anyone who purchased one from me later complain about an
out-of-warranty failure).  Not that I'm saying they're perfect, but I have
been sufficiently impressed that theirs is the only '72-83 head I'll sell.
If their track record is that good (at least with my customers), then I
wonder how much additional benefit could be obtained from buying a new,
possibly-flawed head (at high cost) and then sending it out for new valve
seats (at even higher cost)?  Maybe it's worth it if price is no object. But
I'll say this, when I needed a new engine for my wasserboxer Vanagon, I
weighed the options carefully (including VW factory engines, still available
for that year) but bought mine from AVP.
