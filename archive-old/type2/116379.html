Subject: Where do you keep your fire extinguisher?

Hi Volks- I just checked my fire extinguisher and found it was out of date.
Bought a new one (5 lb) and need to know the best place to keep it. I used
to keep it right behind the driver seat but the new one is too big. Any
suggestions? TBear ( and I'm sure we all keep a fire extinguisher in our
bus, don't we? :))
