Subject: Dipstick style temp. sender question

Has anyone had trouble with oil leaking from the dipstick tube after
installing a VDO dipstick temp. sender?

The new dipstick doesn't have a metal &quot;cup&quot; that covers the end of the
dipstick tube like the stock dipstick does.  Instead, there's a dense
cotton disk that butts up against the end of the tube. 

Anyone have any problems with oil leaking from this setup?
