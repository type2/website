Subject: FREE '81 POPTOP
Mime-Version: 1.0

One last time, somebody haul the '81 out of here else it goes to
the yard on the 24th.  It has a poptop with canvas in fair condition
(hey it's better than Dolan's.)  The upper cushions were mint as
well until a mouse ate a hole in the extreme rear of the rear one
but it could be patched with material from the bottom and look
perfect.  The canvas has water stains and many pinholes and the
top fizz is mildewed but not nearly as bad as some.  If you got one
you want to turn into a weekender, this is the ticket.  The interior
is there excepting the stove/fridge cabinet.  It is all ratty as hell and
I wouldn't use it.  Curtains are gone.  Front door panels gone.  Front
glass shot, rear glass gone, other glass good but no camper side
windows (given away just regular van sliders.)  Propane tank gone.
Only really good thing on this van otherwise is that the front end
bushings on the A-arms were all brand new 5 years and 10k miles
ago.  Most all signal lenses, window winders, etc present.  No parts,
no BS.  You take entire van from Clarksburg WV by 7/26/01.  No
engine, no tranny, no brakes, no grille.

If you really want to convert a van, I personally would only do it this
way.  To just cut a hole in the top of a regular van might look good but
you would NOT want to be in it in a rollover, you need to remove and
weld in the rest of the support structure, a major PITA undertaking.

Oh one of the front doors is pretty fair, the rest of the body is worthless.
Provided on 4 tires that hold air, and has a tow bar of sorts rigidly bolted
(no hinge) to the front of the vehicle.  You tow it as is AT YOUR OWN
RISK.  You can borrow my nice commercial tow dolly with brakes for a
totally refundable $1200 deposit (as in you give me $1200 cash, tow it
off, return my dolly get the whole $1200 back, else you bought it.)  It
will be a very light tow without engine/tranny and I'd almost guess a
strong waterboxer could haul it off, definitely towards the west.

This top and the electrical, front end, steering rack, column, etc got
to be worth it to someone.  It's nothing beautiful but could be the making
of a cheap weekender.  No questions, no BS, no pictures (well I might
take one on the 23rd if you are really interested, but no time till then)
