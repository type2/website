Subject: RE: [T2] more battery relay questions and fridge.. 

James,

'75 Westfalia Deluxes had a dual battery system that would
charge from the alternator or shore power via a control panel on the front
of the  closet in the back. My '75 Westy hardtop had such a panel. It had
a small meter gauge that indicated the state of the aux battery as well as
an 'egg' timer to charge it off shore power. There was also a fuse on the
panel to the best of my recollection (the bus is gone :(. 


'74 models worked a little different...

My current '74 doesn't have such a panel and thus the aux battery will
only charge off the alternator when the bus is running. The fridge has a
switch that will allow operation of either the aux battery or shore power.
I've never seen a '74 (pre August) that has the option of charging the
battery from shore power. I'm pretty sure that it was introduced in late
'74 for the '75 model year. If your battery is under the seat, It has been
moved. It sat in the driver side of the engine compartment on a stock
westy. The realy ( *i think*) is/was mounted just left of the engine door
in the engine compartment.

You will need to install a kit to charge the battery off the alternator or
shore power. Bus depot has the relay for the alternator for $20 or so. I'm
not sure where you can get a city power charging kit off hand...listees?


..Or you can try to find the control panel and inverter off a
'75 and keep it stock.

'74 and '75 U.S. Westies had a very similar
interior...the only changes were the power control panel and shore
charging. The table moved from the wall and a jump seat appeared in '75.
Some other oddball optioned changed in '75 too...like the city water
faucet...although I tihnk i've seen some '74s with that. The placement of
the exterior connections changed too. 


I have lots of '74 and '75 westy parts in lots of colors if anyone is
intrested in making a trade/deal. :)



Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.... '74 and '75
westies are all i've owned, im very used to their setup

Due to the recent questions about relays and such I have one of my own to
add: Bus : 74 Deluxe Westie. Has the fridge which only has a coldness dial
and a 12volt / shore power switch.

The extra battery is under the rear seat.  It powers the fridge well
enough I believe but I am not sure how it recharges. Are they supposed to
automatically charge with shore power connected? Or do they have a relay
installed which charges the battery while driving?

Reason I ask is that the battery seems to be constantly drained. Even when
driving around.  I wasn't sure if it should recharge when I have it
plugged in.  I have an extra relay I could pop in to charge the battery
while it's driving but could it harm anything if it so happens that there
are two relays going at the same time?

I couldn't find any info in the archives that told me definitely...

Thanks

James
