&gt;Next discovery, she isn't a 1700, but a 1800. Okay, Cool!  but now the funny
stuff... they did &gt;put a 1800 head (p/n 022 101 371 H) on the 1 &amp; 2 side, but on
the 3 &amp; 4 side, they put a &gt;1700 head.. (p/n 021 101 371 J)
&gt;Has anyone ever heard of this?  I checked, the 1700 was not bored out and the
1800 had &gt;previous seat damage to the #2 cylinder...

A 1.7L head does not fit the 1.8L bore
unless it is machined. In addition to a
difference in the valve sizes, it also has
a variation in combustion chamber shape
and volume, effecting a different compression
ratio. Unless both heads match, there is a
lot of unnecessary stress directed through the
rods and crankshaft resisting the difference.
Replacement heads should be compared for
combustion chamber displacement, regardless
of the source of supply.
Your 1.8L head is designed for a carburetor
engine, and is a good choice for replacement.
There is another 1.8L head for a fuel-injected
engine configuration, which has smaller valves.
Trade out that 1.7L head and get a matched
pair of something proper for your application.
