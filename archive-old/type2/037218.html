&gt; Lets hear more about these advantages - *if* the data has been gathered and
&gt; CHT being most important.

I do not believe that the advantages exsist, this is the old
Dino/Synthetic oil argument all over again....considering the amount of
work involved I do not believe there is any reason to make the change and
too many opportunities to &quot;screw&quot; it up and make the cooling much worse.

There is also the advantage with the flat engine of the direct drive fan,
no fan belt to adjust or worry about breaking.

short story
  on interstate 95 in very busy traffic my fan belt broke, it was a
construction site with no shoulder,  my flat engine stayed cool so I drove
about 8 miles to a safe place where I could put on the spare I carried....
I doubt I could have safely driven 8 miles on a hot summer day without
cooling on an upright engine.
