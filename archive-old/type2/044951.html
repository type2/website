Subject: Re: [T2] Which engine should I use for my 73 Westy?  Found a 2 L I think?

Thanks to everyone that replied to my questions about an engine for my 73
Westy.  I still haven't been able to catch the person at home that's selling
this type 4 engine but I did find out more info on it and will get to see it
tomorrow.  The engine is complete, pulled out of a 75 bus. It has all the FI
parts, brain, harness, etc, also complete with all tin and exhaust so it
should be just what I need for my bus since I don't have any of those parts.
The person selling it said he drove the bus and has the engine on the ground
now but I can see it run.  If it's the original engine from a 75 then it
should be a 2 liter shouldn't it?   Also will the 75 engine mate up with my
73 tranny/bell housing?

Thanks,
John
