Subject: Re: [T2] What to do?

John,

&lt;Big sigh here&gt;

Based on your daughter's comment, it's time to go check out the storage 
rental places.

&gt; It isn't the money, it's the space.&lt;


Buy some space....and time.

Cheers, dave

&gt; All this talk about unrestored buses is hitting home.  I have a '71 Westy
&gt; with an honest 59K on it.  The body is badly rusted along the rockers and
&gt; corners, the interior is beautiful (PO had it for 27 years, no kids, used it
&gt; two weeks a year).  I've had the brakes completely redone (new drums,
&gt; slaves, calipers, etc.), and the engine ran perfectly until just before I
&gt; garaged it almost two years ago.  It starts right up and runs around like an
&gt; old friend when I run it occassionally, but smokes after it warms up.  I
&gt; haven't run that one down yet.
&gt; 
&gt; My point is that it pains me to have it sit there.  I'm a year behind on a
&gt; house restoration job, and I just can't pay any attention to it.  It's not
&gt; even registered at the moment.  The new house has a nasty little one car
&gt; garage, and the second car is going to sit off to the side on the driveway
&gt; as it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it's time to just say goodbye, and get another when I have room.  It
&gt; cheers me up just sitting in it, and as my daughter once said, you just
&gt; can't be angry when you're driving the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't be the only listee who's had to face this one, and it's Friday.  It
&gt; isn't the money, it's the space.  What do you say:  I don't want to store it
&gt; way out elsewhere, but I feel stuck and the clock is ticking.  Thoughts?
