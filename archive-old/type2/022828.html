&lt;&lt; I took the two Vanagon engines I'm rebuilding to AVP for machine work.  
 Leonard said that he now routinely align bores all the type IV cases he 
 works on because of the high accumulated miles on these engines.  &gt;&gt;

hmmm...to me this doesnt sound good.  i am glad he is at least checking them 
first ( i hope) before slapping them on the machine and running the align 
bore cutters down the center.  i have always liked the type iv a bit more ( 
and trusted it more) one reason was its  apparent ability to not need align 
boring as many believe is a simple routine machining job.  for those who 
think it is....read a couple pages of gene bergs writings on align boring and 
see if you dont change your mind.  oh well, it just my opinion.
