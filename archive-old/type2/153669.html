Gentlemen and ladies of this list, I follow this list to become &quot;educated&quot; in
the workings of my &quot;ride&quot;, yet, I am still amazed that we collectivly love our
rides, but diseminate all we appreciate, over what are &quot;individual
preferences&quot;, outside the list items, and much as I agree that &quot;politically
incorrect&quot;, is a euphamisn of convenience, if you lined all of the list users
up side by side, and asked them what was most important, in the theme of the
list, I would hope that the first answer would be, &quot;because I have one&quot;!  Let
the dust settle, appreciate what you have said, and through the &quot;aspect&quot; of
freedom of speech, let &quot;us&quot; move on!  Flame shields active!
Sid
