Yes, I did.  I got one from aircooled_dot_net, and I think it works... I'm
not totally sure yet... I installed it, then uninstalled it, and I'm
getting a new bus soon, so I'm going to be welding it on there.  It
responds really fast so the hard part is logging the informtaion that
it's giving you... it wouldn't be bad if it were hooked up to a
computer..

The other problem is that this is a narrow band (most of the low end o2
sensors are) and therefore when you get close to the stoichiometric mix
(ideal mix) the curve of the sensor is very steep so getting a value
around that stoich area is somewhat difficult... 

Look in the archives for o2, afm, and stuff like that..

later

&gt; Speaking of AFM's and how to adjust them, (or more generally, how to monitor
&gt; fuel/air mixture) - has anyone installed an oxygen sensor on a T2 exhaust
&gt; manifold? I was thinking of trying this as a method of checking and
&gt; monitoring mixture.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments or suggestions from anyone who's done this?
