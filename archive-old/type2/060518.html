&gt; Y'all,
&gt; 
&gt;  but does 
&gt; anyone have antenna alternatives?
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;&lt;On a Bay Window install an antenna that
&gt; is imbedded in a clear strip that you install
&gt; right on the glass, inside,,,,or try a inductively coupled
&gt; antenna that you stick to the glass on the outside
&gt; and then stick the receptor on the inside. Goes through
&gt; the glass via the same magic (kinda) that gives you
&gt; radio reception. 

The through-the-glass antennas work fine for VHF frequencies and
above, which means that FM reception will be good but AM will not.

Another alternative is to run a wire out of the engine air intake, as
I do for my amateur radio antennas.  Works well with a roof rack and
the only hole you have to punch is hidden behind the spare tire.  This
works well for ham and CB antennas as the hole can be made big enough
to pass coax with PL-259 connectors attached.
