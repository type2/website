Thanks to all who helped w/ my starting problem ... it is indeed the &quot;Hot
Start&quot; problem that I had never heard of.  You have all provided me w/ the
most valuable gift you can give ... new knowledge.  I also learned how to
take a starter out of my bus in the event that I ever have an actual starter
problem LMAO ... in fact, in the process of looking for a starter I took
them off of 2 other junked buses and discovered that not all loaf starters
are the same ... all this knowledge cost me nothing but time and scraped
skin ... you can't beat that price even at WalMart.
