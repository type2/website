Agreement, Stan, on the OEM folding bed. But we found that cooking inside 
the cabin on the built-in propane stove produced too many oily vapors, 
humidity, and excess heat......so we cook outside, and the portable kitchen 
makes that very convenient. Also, the original writer (Eric) didn't want a 
pop-top, which makes cooking outside very probable for him.   And the OEM 
refrigerator isn't as convenient for that kind of cooking as a portable one 
plus cooler. We like to drive up to a campsite and unload the kitchen 
module and do all the food prep on whatever camp table is provided.  For 
primitive sites, we supply our own folding table. We don't use or need the 
OEM cabinets and they take up valuable space (although they look just 
great.) And most of the time we don't pop the top. We tried the OEM &quot;wheel&quot; 
and it didn't entirely suit our camping style, so we supplemented.

I believe I'd advertise for the OEM Westfalia parts required and not try
to re-invent the wheel. Their cabinets get loose once in a while but you
can retighten the fasteners. I believe this flexibility feature is why
Genuine Westfalia cabinets stay nice for so long.
