Subject: I Need Photos of 72-73 Bus Engine compartment

 Hi all I have a request, I purchased a 73 bus, with a
72 engine installed. The guy I purchased it from did
not have any of the hoses plugged in properly. So for
the last 6 months its been a Jigsaw Puzzle. I would
really appreciate some good pics of the 72 or 73 year
engines, so I know what I need to keep and/or add. Its
probably easier to send them right to me at

Thanks Drew Barnes...73 Bus
