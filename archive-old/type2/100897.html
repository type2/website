&gt; That's not going to heat a bus very well, the South Wind bus heaters are
&gt; 20,000 BTU, the under dash models are 13,000 BTU.  Even the bug style South
&gt; Winds are 13,000.  Check out ebay, buy a South Wind, then get the parts and
&gt; rebuild it.  Gas heaters are no harder to work on than a carb and just like
&gt; a carb, you need to be sure and replace the fuel lines.

remember these are brand new and much more efficient at transferring the
heat, more inside less in exhaust.  also they come in three sizes 12,000
being the smallest, I believe they are also 18 and 24,000 BTU  they are
also very compact and fully self contained.  also they are designed to
recycle the interior air.  the VW heaters draw outside cold air. 

&gt; I started working on the South Wind heaters in the early '70s and have never
&gt; seen one that was every on fire, but I've seen PLENTY of VW's that had been
&gt; at one time (or more).  Many people will say gas heaters are a fire hazard,
&gt; but none have ever been able to produce a burn't South Wind heater other
&gt; than ones in engine bays where the engine caught on fire.

I haven't seen a burned Eberspracher ether

not putting down the Southwind it is a good heater too. all in all only
buses with aux gas heaters have I ever been in that were warm in winter,
and I ski so I put mine to the test
