&gt; please re-read that post. I am looking at the pistons withdrawn down into the
&gt; case bores. The ends of the piston pins arren't visible, nor can the case be
&gt; pushed back together to expose them.

There is a stud inside the case, above the oil pickup tube that will
have to be aligned, and the case  will go together a little more, but not
completely, because you have lost alignment of the main bearing shell pins.
It should be enough to get the pistons off, however.
