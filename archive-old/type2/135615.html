Subject: Re: [T2] UPDATE: Quick help needed: 73 WON'T START!!!!

Gerald: Thank you! You gave me something logical to try that I hadn't
thought of.

I was about ready to pull the alt (and we all know how much fun that
is) and have it tested at a shop tomorrow. I'll definitely try the
points trick first. I have a spare set of points and condenser around
somewhere, and if not I do have that much money...

It's definitely not the wiper motor, since when I saw how it was
heating up wires I disconnected it.

Though it's possible while it was on it did some damage... 

Now that I&quot;m more relaxed and have a few Cap'n &amp; Cokes in me, I'm
thinking more clearly. . . heh  What is the possibility of me having
shorted a wire while messing with the wipers and blowing either the
regulator or the goodies in the alternator? (I've got this image of a
burned out diode or bridge rectifier in my head that won't leave...)
The only thing that keeps me from being sure is the fact that I *do*
get dash lights under some conditions. Many of my tests were done with
the Volvo running and jumper cables attached. So I definitely had
current available. But something's sucking it up...

Thanks all!!!
