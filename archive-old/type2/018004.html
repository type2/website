Subject: question on the poptop hinges and how the top sits when closed
Message-ID: &lt;373B807D.5667_at_ibm_dot_net&gt;

Question: When my top is in the closed position, the rear corners are
touching the metal body when the seal is not on the top.  When I put the
seal on and close the top - the round seal part is completely
compressed, and I can fit my fingers inbetween the top and the body on
the side.  I have tried to adjust the position of the hinges where they
bolt to the top of the bus.  I loosened all of the bolts and slid the
hinge as far forward as possible - complete compression.  Then I slid
the hinges as far back as possible - less compression, but the seal is
still smooshed and there is still enough room on the side to slide my
fingers in.
Any thoughts?
common experiences?
