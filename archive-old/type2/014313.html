Subject: Intermitent Backfires

I recently purchased a '71 Westy and was told by
seller that it needed a new carburetor(sp?). I bought
a new carb, installed it, adjusted the valves and
fired it up. Sounds good but I'd say every 5 sec or
longer I get a small backfire  ---pop---. The bus was
sitting for 2 months before I bought it. What is
causing this and how do I fix it?
