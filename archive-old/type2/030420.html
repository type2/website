Volks,

I would dearly love it if surveys were conducted off-list.  I am not
opposed at all, especially on Fridays, but questions like the one asked
today generate an awful lot of posts, and are much better served if you
phrase them like this:

I would like to conduct a survey on X.  Please respond to me privately.
I will collate and post the results.

Note well, this imposes a certain duty on you to do the collation and
post the results :-)  I know it's Friday, and I try to stay quiet on
Fridays, but my goodness...  what a lot of posts!

If you see this before you post to the list, could you please send it
directly to Bernie?  (WMeinhart_at_email.msn_dot_com)  And, Bernie, could you
assemble them and post a combined response?

                           H Steven Dolan
			   Administrator, type2 list
