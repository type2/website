Verify battery rest voltage after rebound from load test. Clean case and 
cables. Verify no vacuum leaks. Verify hot blue snap at plug gap. If no, 
standard ignition system inspection. (Plugs fouled, low volts to coil 
(ignition switch resistance), cracked cap or rotor, points foul or dwell 
wrong due to wear of rubbing block, high resistance in HT wires, dwell and 
timing must be correct.) If yes, check fuel pressure and volume, temp 
sensors, cold start injection system (cold start injector, thermo-time 
switch, idle air bypass valve), free movement of air flap, on FI, or choke 
adjustment/function on carb/s.
