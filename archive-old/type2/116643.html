Jay and Lynn will be holding a T-Dying Clinic on Saturday.  They will have 
the dye and such - you provide the shirt. There will be a $5 fee to cover 
the supplies, all profits to the Full Moon Bus Club.  Many have already said 
they want to dye their High Country T-Shirts.  This year's HCBF shirts will 
be white so that those who want to dye them can.  Lynn says you will need to 
bring them your shirt, or whatever you want to dye, to them on Friday night 
because they need to soak overnight in SodaAsh - which insures the vibrant 
colors :-)

If you would like to donate a door prize, please let Buddah know.


thanks,
let me know if you have any questions, suggestions or demands :-)
Buddah
