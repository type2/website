I believe Wilson says that you should not use the rubbery type of sealer to
seal the case because it will cause the case not to mate fully and will
cause a loss of bearing crush.  I'd advise you to use something else - I
use the Permatex (3H?) aviation sealer - brown gooey stuff that goes on
with a brush - and it's always worked well for me.
