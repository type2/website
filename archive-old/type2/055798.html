Subject: Door handle button doesn't open door
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi All,

The button on the outside of the drivers door is not working. 
I pulled it and it stayed &quot;in&quot; without opening the door.  I pried it out and applied
some liquid wrench, and now it doesn't stick in, but it doesn't open the door
either.

The door opens fine from the inside, and the lock works fine - i.e. if I close the door
with the door locked the lock unlocks.  Usually I would lock the door and hold in
the handle as I shut it so that it stays locked, however now since the lock button
isn't working it unlocks as if the button was not pushed.

Any ideas?

Thanks, 

Mark
