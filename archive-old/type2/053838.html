Subject: RE: What kind of engine

Hello,
I am running a Mark Stephens High Performance built 2.1 liter in my 81
Westy.  It is an amazing difference and it uses the stock l-jetronic unit
and stock exhaust.  I had fun tricking the fuel injection to run richer than
stock but once I got it dialed in the power difference is huge, and it
passes smog in CA  ( you have to lean it out a bit for the test but not to
dangerous levels). 

Any one out there need a 2.0 liter hydraulic t4 that runs but is tired and
needs a rebuild? San Francisco Area cheap

I'm curious about your opinions about what is the 'best' engine for a '72
bus.  I've heard that 1700's are the most stable, as in live the longest and
are most durable, but it was just one person's opinion.
I'm toying with the idea of building an engine.  I don't want to pull my
1700 from my bus as it runs and I need it running, but it would be a great
learning experience, etc.  I'd be in no hurry as it would be a project and
not a rebuild to get my bus running kind of thing.

I would like to have a reliable motor with a decent amount of power.  I.e. I
can cruise down the road at 70 mph on a flat-ish highway without worrying
about blowing the engine up and I don't have to fiddle with the carbs/jets
every time the weather changes or I change my altitude by a 1000 feet.

I keep hearing about Porsche engines, V6's, Japanese motors, hydraulic
lifters and electronic ignitions, rubberbands used by NASA and hamsters on
Crack being used.

Any thoughts?
