Subject: Re: [T2] Baywindow Bus Sighting: Riding the Bullet

I don't think they totalled it.  They don't show a crumpled front,
just broken front window.

Now, what 2+ 360' spins will do to a bus... (plus retakes?) ...  and
HOW to get a bus to do that.

Still enjoying the Lybian's sunroof in Back to the future'ly yrs,

Dean
