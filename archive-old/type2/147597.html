Subject: Side tent for sale

I have a VW side tent from a mid 70's bay for sale. Here is the catch:
The bottom was taken off (unstitched). It can be sewn back on real
easy with a heavy duty machine. I was quoted $80.00 by a local shop and that included reinforcing the lower corners. I have all the poles and stakes.
One pole was repaired but works great. There is a few small holes ,nothing major. I also have most of the original stakes if not all. It can be shipped but expect a couple heavy packages. The rubber gutter strip is also in nice shape. My digi camera is broken so unless I can talk my wife into a new camera or borrow one can't provide them. You are more than welcome to come look at it. First $200.00 takes it. 
I can take paypal. In MYSTIC,CT.

Bill
