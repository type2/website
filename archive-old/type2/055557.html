Subject: rain fly?

hello everyone

I just wanted to add a note to the post &quot; VW Camping Tents &quot;  one of the
questions asked was did they make and original rain fly and the answer is
yes.  For the add a room tents from the late 60s and 70s there was and
original canvas rain fly you could order as an option I believe.  There was
one floating around here in the northwest, at the classic last year in
california it was on display.  It was sold before I had a chance to make a
pattern from it.  I am still interested in reproducing them if anyone can
help me out with a pattern (susan?) I would realy apreciate it. hope this
helped

keep camping
