Subject: For Sell

I just got a new  air compressor so I am selling my old one. It's a
Sears 1.5 HP 12 GL tank  air compressor.  I used it to do some painting
and it seemed to do okay.  I have also used it with a siphon sandblaster
and if you are doing a small area, it will work, if you are patient. It
is also good for cleaning up things, filling up tires, and a number of
other things. If you are looking for a compressor that will run 
pneumatic tools most of the  tools  require a larger air compressor.

This air compressor sells new for around $200.00

I am selling this one for $75.00 

If you are interested give me a call at 404 687 9217 or E-mail be at
