Subject: 71 Westy wood headliner refinishing
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hi....I am helping my friend fix his 71 non-pop top Westy

The wood paneling is peeling off the top layer of what looks like varnish

I think its because the previous owner used a propane camp stove to  much and 
it became moist....

the wood is fine, only the finish is flaking....

is there anyway to make it look right again ?

thanks for your help and suggestions
