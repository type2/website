High idle shouldn't cause the bus to overheat.  Your bumper can get very 
hot if you don't have the heat shield between the muffler and bumper (under 
the rear tin).  Other than that, I can't comment because there are way too 
many variables.  Get some gauges (oil temp and pressure) and some readings 
from them and we can go from there.  Or, you can &quot;fly blind&quot; like those 
budget-minded marketing people at VW intended (I'm sure the engineers were 
in favor of gauges).  :-)
