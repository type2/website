Subject: Re: [T2] Heat Exchanger Removal?

Chris,

Type 1 and type 4 engines have almost *no* interchangeable parts.
In other words, headers and mufflers for a t1 will *not* fit a t4.


You will never be able to generate enough electric heat to keep warm 
with a battery...this has been discussed on the list endlessssssssly.

Hot jet coating headers *is* supposed to reduce radiated heat from the 
headers quite a bit.  From 750 to 300 degrees.

If your heat exchangers  are in good shape, leave them on...you won't 
regret it, and you will stay warmer in the long run....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Now just to make sure I'm not being dumb again, the Heat Exchangers are
&gt; their ONLY for passenger comfort right? So taking them off, shouldn't

&gt;  
&gt; See, I'm going to install electric heaters/blowers off my aux. battery.
&gt; So I'm thinking to remove the heat exhcangers, and have my headers
&gt; Ceramic coated (to keep heat down). Their ARE normal headers under the
&gt; heat exchangers right? Or if I take off the heat exchangers will I be
&gt; left needing to find some headers that fit. 
&gt;  
&gt; Also, I see a lot of headers and mufflers for Type-1's. Will those fit
&gt; onto a Type-4?
