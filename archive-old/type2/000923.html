Hey everybody,

This upcoming weekend (6-26) I'm planning on driving my 71 bus from southern
New Jersey to the coast of Maine. I'm in no rush to get there and even less
to get back. I want to use secondary and surface roads.

 Does anyone have experience driving such a route? Any nice places to camp
along the way? And campgrounds in Maine that you've enjoyed? And also, as a
bonus, VW garages along the way?

TIA.

Bill
