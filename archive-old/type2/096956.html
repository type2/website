Subject: Re: [T2] oil, and the berg dipstick sender

&gt;Craig.

&gt;I have the Berg sender as well and really love it... Can you give
&gt;a quick rundown on how you set up the buzzer system?
&gt;chris

i went to radio snack and picked up a 12v piezo buzzer - 03a99 if i recall
correctly.
then i connected one buzzer wire to the black wire that feeds to the black
plastic housing in which the bulbs sit, and then took the other wire from
the buzzer and attached it to a ground (screw under dash).
look under your dash it it should be more obvious than i'm describing.

one could take a diff. sounding buzzer and do it for the gen light, too.
also good for making sure those lights aren't burnt out. i forget which way
it works, but if the oil light burns out w/ this setup, you'll either NOT
hear a buzzer when you turn on the ignition, OR you'll still hear the
buzzer if the engine overheats, but not see a light -  natch. we'll find
out when the bulb goes :)

does get a bit annoying when you are doing something that requires you to
leave the ign on, as the buzzer is LOUD, but worth the hassle.
