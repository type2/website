Volks,
I have a new rebuild here that i have put in my SC.  New wires, pertronix,
plugs, etc.  Plugs are torqued in.  Timing set at 30 degrees total, with an
009 dizzy and dual kads.

Thing starts on about the 3rd turn of the key..............and stalls when I
give pedal.  Does this 2 or 3 times and then runs and pops(sputters) a lot
when i try to give it gas. It will warm up and smooth out, but I have not
road tested yet for fear of the worst.  I have done a few other rebuilds,
and usually they run smooth right off the bat (more or less).  I know the
carbs are good, for i had them recently on  a 1600..............I balanced
them earlier in the week, But the readings on my synchrometer seemed a
little high for 1000 rpms.

I have adjusted the valves, same result.
