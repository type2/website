Subject: Re: [T2] Engine removal

Stephan,

I've done it in a similar way a loooong time ago.

Please believe me, it is so much easier with a jack, that is is almost 
worth any amount of time, begging, borrowing or money to have a jack.

Plus!  When you get ready to put it back in, you can almost  roll it right 
in.

*please* get a jack!

The case *is* strong enough, but please consider a jack!

Pull the engine ,then place the 4x4's on each side under the engine as you 
let it down toward the floor.


Cheers, dave

&gt; Dear list,
&gt; 
 After years of avoidance, my first engine pull is going to happen. It is 
 a well covered topic, but I have what I think is a new question. Do I 
 have to support the engine under the sump plate as all the books say, or 
 can I put supports on  either side of it (they would press against the 
ribbed part of the crackcase)? To be more precise, I have cut a 
 foundation block so that two foot long pieces of 2 inch square timber 
 will  just slide in like railroad tracks about 8 inches apart from the 
&gt; back of the vehicle. They are a snug fit, so when I let a little air out 
&gt; of the tires and push the van forward (I have a removable rear valance), 
&gt; I am hoping to leave the engine behind on a nice stable table. The 
&gt; crankcase looks strong enough to me, but I don't want to do this, crack 
&gt; the case, and then have everyone saying I should have known better.
&gt; 
&gt; Forgot to say, it is a type I motor (it's a UK 1973 1600 DP).
