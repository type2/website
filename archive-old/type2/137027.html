Subject: FI ECU Compatibility and need one too

Richard and list,
Richard, if I understand your compatibility list correctly, all 
air-cooled Vanagon ECUs are alike, Federal or CA, 80 - 83, as long as 
you stick with whatever transmission you have.

Have I got this right?

If so, does anyone have an AC Vanagon, manual transmission version ECU 
extra I could purchase?

Richard, thanks for your website!

GG
'82 CA Vanagon Westy, 4-speed
