&gt; &gt;o My question is.  How do we
&gt; &gt;get it started?  It has been sitting for so long that the pistons are
&gt; &gt;probably frozen.  How do we get it running without tearing the engine
&gt; &gt;apart?  We were told to put mystry oil down the plug holes for a week and
&gt; &gt;let it seep in and loosen the pistons.  Do you folks have any advice?
&gt; 
&gt; Check the oil. Make sure it's between the two notches, preferably closer to
&gt; the top one. spray some wd-40 on the battery straps, remove battery and put
&gt; on a couple of phone books and trickle charge it overnight. In the morning,
&gt; put battery in, make sure the fan belt isn't super loose. start it up and let
&gt; it run for a half hour. If the charge battery still doesn't turn it over,
&gt; then remove the spark plugs and squirt a little bit of castrol oil into the
&gt; spark plug holes there in from an old oil can that squirts -not too much-
&gt; then be spinning the motor with a wrench on the generator nut until it
&gt; loosens up. fire it up!

Chris, Chuck:
I think I'd drain and flush the fuel tank and probably have to take the
carb apart and clean it out too. Then of course the brakes will be
totally toast. Every hydraulic cylinder will be rusted. At least that's
how it is here in the midwest. Sitting is much harder on brakes because
the accumulated water in the brake fluid never gets boiled off!
Making a long-time non-runner driveable again is a big piece of work.
