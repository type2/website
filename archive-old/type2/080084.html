&gt; &gt; The answer is probably yes, but it doesn't matter.  Take a 3&quot; drywall
&gt; &gt; screw, put it on the ground, point up. Put a tire on top of it. Give a
&gt; &gt; single blow with a 3,000 pound hammer moving at 60 miles per hour. OK?
&gt; &gt; 'Nuf said?
&gt;
&gt; ...of course,  the chances of that screw staying on its head when you come
&gt; near it at 60 mph are pretty slim, i'd say....but if the screw it lucky
&gt; i'd still find a way in.

Ever notice that most flats are on the rear wheels?  The front tire stands
the nail/screw up just long enough for it to puncture the rear tire!  On
my street motorcycle I run a mudflap in front of the tire that just clears
the ground.  Knocks the nails aside.

&gt; &gt; As for personal experence, I patched the S rated tires on the quantum
&gt; roughly 10 times...well, plugged, actually, in a little over a year since
&gt; new. (of course, that was 50 thousand miles ago, too...and the new set is
&gt; so far hole free..).

Wow!  Sounds like it was driven by a carpenter!

&gt; Fingers crossed, I've never had to plug any of the load D tires I've
&gt; owned. (three? sets of Y370s...even when they were down to nothing more
&gt; then a slick, and the bridgestoners that are on the 66
&gt; now.)

My Bridgestones have been hole-free as well.  I think that the highway
tread might not hold nails as well as more aggressive treads.

&gt; No real changes in driving conditions, at least between the 66 and the
&gt; quantum.  The tire-eating-monster '69..well.  She saw a LOT of extreme
&gt; terrain.

Which is why I carry 2 spares while on the road.  The tires are hard to
find and I'm not going to get stuck with buying 195/75s again!  If you go
out to central Nevada, you'll see two spares in every pickup.  They don't
even bother to secure them since they go through tires so fast!
