Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Oil temp sender/sump plate

on 9/4/03 16:32, Marc related:
&gt; 
&gt; Given all the talk about inconsistent temp readings from sump plate temp
&gt; sensors, would it be better to just install a cylinder head temp system
&gt; instead?

in addition to, i would have to say.

&gt; What value do oil temp readings give you over cylinder head temp
&gt; readings?

oil temp = rpm related. you can run nice cool head temps at 3800 rpm on flat
ground, but your oil temps may go up.

head temp = load related. climb a long hill at 3000 rpm, and the oil temps
may stay low, but your head temps will rise.

&gt;  Do you use these readings in conjunction with oil pressure
&gt; readings?

with oil temp, head temp and pressure you will always know what is going on
back there...
