Subject: Re: [T2] Beetlemex engine first start Q

One more key item to add to the to-do list for prepping your meximotor:

That upper-right-front bolt hole in the bellhousing, for one of the four
bolts between the engine and the transmission, has threads that need to
be removed BEFORE the engine gets put in the bus and mated with the
transmission.  I discovered this last Friday night AFTER installing the
engine and discovering that the the bolt (which, keep in mind, can't
turn since it's braced against the starter) wouldn't fit through..
(thought process went like this: &quot;is it misaligned somehow?  no, can't
be.  what the heck is going on?  oh.. no, it couldn't be..&quot;)  Now I get
to re-drop the engine tomorrow and try again.  But hey: it's all good
practice!  And since I finally got my private pilot checkride out of the
way (and passed!) this afternoon, I'll actually have the spare time to
get it done.

I also added an oil filter: wishful thinking, maybe, but I want my new
engine to stay that way!  NW ConRod set it up for about $200 including
labor, parts, fittings, hoses, etc.  Incidentally, I found out in that
process that NW ConRod actually sells meximotors.  Something to consider
when shopping around.. I had no idea when I ordered mine that I could
have bought it with a personal guarantee from the friendliest, most
reputable VW machine shop in the country.  Hella tempting, I'd say.

Thanks again to Chuck Meanley for his help in getting the thing put
together.. I couldn't have gotten that distributor drive gear right on
my own!

Good luck!
