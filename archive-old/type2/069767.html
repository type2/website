Subject: Getting my bus home...

As many of you already know, I bought a bus last October but have left it 
sitting this good ol' gal's farm that we know.  She's been in no hurry to 
get it off her property and I didn't have room for the bus.  I still 
don't - but I found a kind farmer who rents storage on his land for $5 a 
month.  That'll do.

Anyhow, I made an expedition out of the 70 mile (one way) trip and 
invited my youngest brother, sister, and cousin to go for a road trip.  
They gladly accepted so off we went down into Kansas with all our needed 
gear - 45 gallon trash bags (needed for cleaning purposes), hornet and 
wasp spray (carb cleaner works just as good - melts their bodies!), 4 
cement blocks, 4 landscape timbers (cheaper then 4x4 posts), set of 
tools, hydraulic jack, and some 2x4 scraps to put on the jack.

My goal was to get this bus ready to haul home.  It was full of such 
things as dual port heads, cardboard sheets, pop cans, beer cans, old 
clothes, aluminum chimney pipe, vaccuum cleaner parts from the 1950's, etc.
The bus had also sunk into the ground about 6 inches from setting so 
long so I wanted to get it up and out of the ground and then tow it away 
from the building it sat next to so as to gain entry to the side doors.  
It would be a lot easier to clean out if we could do this.

Within an hour, I had each wheel up on a 2x4 scrap, and after 2 trips 
with the air bubble, filled 3 tires and had to change the LR because dry 
rot rendered it useless.  Anyhow closer inspection revealed that indeed, 
the front 2 wheels have the 5 lug chevy pattern (no adaptors - it's the 
drums) while the rears have the standard gaping hole 5 lug pattern.  

This 1966 has the extra window on the side with jailbars around the 
back.  It appears to be factory beige with beige interior.  The only 
seats in it are the 2 seats up front - I think the gal said she had the 
bench seat for it but I'll bet you 2 flips of coin that it's gone for good.
Anyhow, we got it towed about 10 feet backwards with the use of a cable 
and my Suburban.  

We ended up removing 2 bags (remember - 45 gallon now) plus -  of trash, a 
tad over 1 bag of aluminum cans, and a ton of generators, Briggs and 
Stratton engines, 7 heads, and at least 200 lbs. of old electrolux 
vaccuum cleaners parts.  It's amazing how much that bus held.  Anyhow, I 
sat behind the wheel of a bus for the 1st time today...and the neat thing 
is, I had to fight my cousin for the driver's seat!  Moving on, I 
finished the day buy propping it up on cement blocks to keep the weight 
off the tires and sometime next week I'll be bringing it home.  

The body has some rust but for the most part, it's solid and the axle 
hasn't rusted out.  The only cancer I see is about a 4 foot span on 
either side on the bottom and on the 2 rear corners.  These are hard to 
replace I'm sure but otherwise the bus is real solid.  I need to run all 
new breaks, put a new engine in it, and make sure the mecanicals are up 
to par and I'm ready to cruise!  I want to get an old reel to reel tape 
recorder and fill it with Led Zeppelin and all my other favourite tunes 
and cruise the contryside with it.  That woud rock!

I am impressed with the simplicity of the bus.  Lots of space to work on 
it underneath and everything mechanically related is either packed up 
front or in the rear with very little in the middle.

Just wanted to let you all know the 66 is almost home! 

Slater!
