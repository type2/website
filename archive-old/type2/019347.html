Subject: Possible single cab and Computer Gurus Help!

Hi Volks,

I'm pretty excited about the possibility of adding a 1969 single cab to
my bus herd.
I will be looking at it either Tuesday or Wednesday.  Any particulars
that I need to look for?  I know the areas where to look for rust, any
place special for a single cab?  Well that is my bus stuff.  Now to my
real problem :0)  I am trying to finish up my two grad courses this
summer and I am allowed to use any resources other than my classmates.
Do any of the list have any expertise in the subjects of computer
architecture and or C++ programming knowledge.  If you would like to
lend me a hand in some problems that I have been banging my head against
the wall about, PLEASE  email me at airhead_at_acvw_dot_com  Thanks, I want to
finish this stuff so I have some bus time before the school year starts.

Thanks,

Auker
