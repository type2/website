Here's an interesting one from Fred Hansson's VW Archive page: (Contact 
them, not me)

big van for sale
   Speciaal made by the Kamperink Company in Holland. I turned
   one into a camper and spent a year traveling in Europe. It worked so
   well, I returned to Holland, visited the factory and bought a second
   one which I shipped home. I used this one as daily transportation
   during college then put a Buick V-6 in it in 1989. Since installing
   the new engine in '89, I have only put a few thousand miles on it.
   The cargo area is great. A six foot man can stand up inside, it is
   wide enough for a queen sized bed, has a removable double stainless
   steel sink, (had a propane refrig), propane forced air furnace,
   sliding rooftop skyights, side and rear doors. Additional rear bumper
   with motorcycle rack and trailer hitch. The interior accomodates full
   lenth windsurfer masts, full lenth boards (13&quot;).
   The van has never been in an accident, body is straight, needs paint
   and rust work. Because of mostly sitting and rust, the brake system
   needs complete cleaning although the drums, rotors amd pads are
   probably still like new.
   I hate to sell it but now live a couple of hours from where it's
   stored in Irvine, and don't have a convenient place to park it where
   I'm now living.
   Thank You,
