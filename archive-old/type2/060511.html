Subject: gas in oil

I have been having this gas-in-the-oil problem in a 74 westy since I had a rebuilt 1800 type IV installed, probably 500-1000 miles ago.    Not to where the oil level was any higher, just an obvious odor.  Before that the vehicle sat for a few years without an engine.  The pile of parts included dual dellorto carbs, which I had cleaned up and installed, then rebuilt and installed, then removed and installed a new weber progressive.  I know, I know, but my 75 bus runs great with an 009 &amp; weber progressive, so I went that route since I thought the dual carbs were the gas leaking culprets.  OK, I still have a gassy smell in the oil, so I decide that I'm not getting a clean burn a combustion chamber or two, so today I was going to install new plugs, a new 009 dist. with electronic ignition, new plug wires, change the oil, you know, get a clean start.  When I walked by the vehicle this morning the gas smell was really bad, so I checked the oil, and it was about 2 quarts higher than !
the top fill line on the dipstick.

The electric fuel pump was there when I got the camper.  It is mounted on the inside lower frame member, lower than the engine and the gas tank.  

Those are the facts, here are the questions.

I was going to replace my camper's tank and electric fuel pump from my wrecked 79 bus, both working fine when bus was wrecked.  Do all those lines from the vent system have to be hooked up?  Can they just be plugged off at the tank?  I know VW didn't do anything just to do it, but that mess of tubes, explain that.

Is it possible that some trash is in my float chamber, and gas has siphoned into my crankcase through the carb?

I'm really getting a little frustrated.  I don't want to mess this engine up, but I'm already worried about the pistons &amp; cylinders.  Oil pressure is good, but I havn't done a compression check.
