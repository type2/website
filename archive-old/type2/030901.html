&gt; &gt; OK, Loctite is a must.  My question is, how do you get that nut off
&gt; &gt; the next time it must be removed?  The last gland nut I removed bent

loctite makes a &quot;removable&quot; version that keeps a bolt from vibrating loose
but will release when constant presure is applied from a wrench.

will have to look in my tool box for the number, I use it on all the
&quot;removable&quot; bolts and nuts even head bolts etc.  never had a problem with
it coming loose nor breaking the bolt when needed

&gt; &gt; my flywheel holder angle iron tool so that I had to reinforce it
&gt; &gt; before I could get the bloody thing off.  If it had Loctite on that

been there done that

&gt; &gt; The gland nut is one of the design features I like least about VW
&gt; &gt; engines.  No wonder they went to multiple bolts on the Type 4 engine.

yup, glad I went to type 4 engines about 20 years ago, when they were
brand new and only avaliable in a type 4 car!  haven't used anything else
since.
