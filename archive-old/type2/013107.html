Hello Victor,

I am sure everyone will have their opinion on this
issue and here is mine.

I currently own a bus that is not in driving order and
has just been a project and not transportation so far.
My goal is to finish the body work, get the engine
running so I can drive it. If I were you, I would
forget the minor dings for now but continue replacing
all of the rust pannels and get rid of as much rust a
possible. Once that is done, have it sprayed in a
professional, rust restant,high quality primer. This
way, you could fix each ding one at a time in your
spare time until you are ready to have it painted.

For now, I probably would not worry so much with the
window rubbers. You can save bits of money here and
ther and buy and install a few at a time. The same
with the canvas. If you are looking at a paint job
that is more quality (and expense) than Maco, I would
make sure to remove the window moldings before hand to
prevent from a nasty paint line showing if you
purchased new rubbers after it was painted. Removing
them first will also reveal more rust to deal with but
better to fix it before it is painted than after.

This way, if you are shipped off and leave the bus
behind, it woln't be a pile of rust when you return.

Well, I guess that was my 2 cents worth.May be it
helped, or may be it just made you verry sleepy.

Either way, if you fix it like you want it, it will be
somthing you can be proud of and not disappointed in.

Havew a nice day!

&gt; I'm faced witha dilemma.  I still need to
&gt; replace all window rubber,
&gt; repair a few small dents, replace the bottom portion
&gt; of the nose, the beam
&gt; behind it, and have it painted. almost forgot, I
&gt; also need to replace the
&gt; canvas. 
&gt; On the good side, the bus drives great, and the
&gt; interior is in very good
&gt; shape. I'm leaning towards doing a partial
&gt; restoration, new rubber, MAACO
&gt; paint job,etc. It just kills me to do stuff half
&gt; ass, but I don't want to
&gt; put lots of money into it and then receive orders to
&gt; go overseas(I'm in the
&gt; Army)
