Subject: Re: [T2] Belly pans?


It is supposed to have one of those clip on &quot;holders&quot; that the screw goes
in to...slept too much lately...I can't remember what to call them.

Basically a folded piece of metal that has a screw hole in it.  Slip it
over the lip, raise the belly pan up to and put the screw thru them.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Don't know about the size, but mine were just metal screws. &amp; it
&gt; looked like a few of them are infact stripped out.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; or maybe my hole is really stripped
