Stock OEM (as in Elring) intake gaskets have never been sandwiched since the
dual port T1 engine.  No sealer is necessary on properly fitted and torqued
parts, and silicone is not an adequate band-aid.

&gt;The gaskets between manifold and head (both input and output manifolds) are

&gt;On fitting the metal ridge is deformed and the black compound is compressed

That's very interesting.  The gaskets that I have seen look like they were
cut from a single sheet of aluminum and the small ridge is just a
deformation of the metal - definitely not sandwich construction and
definitely no goop inside.  By strange coincidence I've had a terrible time
in the past getting those gaskets to seal, even the first time.  They
always had small leaks as evidenced by the WD-40 test.  I was finally able
to get a decent seal by sanding and polishing the mating surfaces of the
head and intake manifold.  I've seen many engines that used various types
