Subject: Was: Being Sued by VWoA

Hey all, first I want to thank you all for your help when I was in need.
Let me recap..I had recieved a few letters from VWoA thru Continental
Enterprises stating that I could no longer sell some hubcap clocks I had
made a year or so earlier. We agreed to all their terms, then they
turned around and said we had to pay over $3000 in damages, and if we
didnt by a certain date, that amount could be tripled, and to top it
off, we get that letter right after going to a VW show! Anyways word
spread thru the newsgroups, and I was pointed in the direction of a fine
attorney, yes, I said FINE attorney! He did a great job with these guys
for me, writing them a lettr on my bahalf,  and for the past few months
we havent heard anything back from them. And he didnt even charge me a
penny! So thanks Chris, and once again, thanks to all who tried helping
me out! You guys saved me a bunch of cash and headaches!  
Brian
