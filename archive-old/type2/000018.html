Subject: Flywheel Installation!!
Message-ID: &lt;0.2628e660.2537da01_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I measured my flywheel play _at_ .005 and then follow directions installing the 
seal, then the sealing ring and once you install the sealing ring and bolt 
the flywheel back on , your .005 of crank play is now gone.  Is this the 
correct procedure or am I missing something????

   Thankyou
