&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; My family and I will be driving from Toronto, Ontario, down the 
&gt; eatern
&gt; seaboard, across
&gt; the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico, down through Texas and 
&gt; finally
&gt; into Mexico.
&gt; I've been looking at &quot; RV Park and family campgrounds of America &quot; 
&gt; on
&gt; the internet
&gt; and find that it will cost around $25 - $30 per night for our VW bus 
&gt; and
&gt; tent.
&gt; These campgrounds range from 40 - 800 RV sites in size, and they all
&gt; have cable
&gt; hook-ups, game rooms, hot tubs, swimming pools, big screen tv's etc.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is; are there alternative campgrounds that are perhaps
&gt; smaller, unusual,
&gt; and cheaper through the US ? Where do bus folk go when traveling ? 
&gt; How
&gt; does one
&gt; find these places ?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help.
