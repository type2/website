Subject: Edmonton Listee's??

Hi Volks,

Business takes me to Edmonton from Monday - Wednesday. If there's  
anyone on the list who wants to get together and talk buses on Monday  
or Tuesday night, please drop me a line.

I've pulled this stunt in Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Vancouver (twice)  
and Abbotsford BC, and have found it quite worthwhile EVERY time.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
