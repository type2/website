Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Pump

I'll attest to &quot;toast when dry&quot;- once left it running when in the
driveway to pump up the lifters, came out, and it had stalled....#_at_&amp;#&amp;^%
the tank had run dry and upon filling it, it would not start.  Sigh,
that pump went 243,000 mi- I've never run out of gas on the
road.........

 If you ran it without fuel flowing, it will get loud real fast and be

 in but a few moments. They are cooled by the fuel and without it will
burn
