&gt;I read your article and it seems more than some of us can do at this
&gt;point, however for regular heat during winter do you reccomend forced
&gt;heat? I have heard there are some on the market but have found none so
&gt;far.

Ed,

I don't know which of my nearly 200 articles you've read although I can guess
it was one having to do with the onset of winter and the poor heating in
early buses.  Also, your definition of 'forced heat' is not clear.  I've
writing several articles advocating the conversion of the present open-loop
(one-pass) heating to closed-loop (recirculating) heating, as is used on all
modern cars.  But perhaps I can help in another, less expensive way.

For a quick winter fix, if you have an old bus try plumbing BOTH heat
exchangers to the central duct -- there is a 'Y' built-in for this purpose.
 Use flexible aluminum tubing, as for heater ducting (the ducting will see
over 200 degrees).  You can cut up an ironing board pad or hot water heater
insulation wrap to insulate the new duct.  Up front, pop off your interior
panels and stuff the space behind with dacron (polyester) quilt stuffing --
you can get a big bag of it at K-mart or similar stores.  Look in the sewing
section.  Back in the cockpit, make sure you have no air leaks around the
penetrations through the floor Under the cockpit, insulate the heater duct
and make sure your belly pan is in place.  If your belly pan is missing,
fabricate something to serve in its place -- you want to deep water &amp; air
from chilling that section of the heater duct.

Back in the cargo bay or passenger compartment, lay down at least three
layers of cardboard then cover it with plastic then cover the plastic with a
final layer of cardboard.  Replace the top layer of cardboard whenever it
needs it.

What these mods do is force all of the engine's heat to the front of the
vehicle -- you can melt ice of the windscreen in short order with both
heat-exchangers on line.  Really :-)  The quilt stuffing and cardboard are
just insulation.  They will help retain whatever warmth you can develop
inside the vehicle.  You'll find additional details in my article on
insulating the bus.

If you live in a really cold climate you're going to have to shop for a
gasoline heater.  The interior volume of the bus is simply too large for the
two heat exchangers to keep it comfortable without at least an inch of
high-density urethane insulation between you and the metal skin.  And that
means roof, walls and floor.
