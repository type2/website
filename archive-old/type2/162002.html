Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical Questions - 2nd battery - Accessory

James
&gt; Question 1 - How do I clamp this additional battery down?  How have  
&gt; others done it?
I have an additional battery under the spare wheel well (which is  
passenger side here Down Under)
two small holes were drilled either side of the battery and standard  
battery clamps fitted through the
metal work under to hold the battery in place.

&gt; Question 2 - How do I wire my bus so I can run my radio and other  
&gt; powerered accessories without having the key in the run position?   
&gt; I need really small words for this answer, I am not an electrician  
&gt; for sure.
I have run from the automatic changeover relay, two cables purchased  
from local FLAPS.  These were
calbles designed for providing power to large capacity amplifiers.   
The cable including the outer sheathing
are about 8 mm (5/16&quot;) in diameter.  both cables are fitted with fuses.
One cable goes to a junction box inside the cabinet next to the  
sink.  From there I draw power for the
inverter (600w) and the flat screen TV.
the second cable goes right to the front to provide power for the  
driving lights relay and the CD/radio.
This allows me to have the radio/CD or TV running without the  
ignition on.
