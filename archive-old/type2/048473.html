Subject: [T2] Clunking noise

My 78 has just developed a clunking noise
(quite loud). This noise seems to track wheel
speed, not engine speed, it doesn't matter
what gear.
The clunking noise only happens when the
engine is in gear, if I'm rolling with the
noise, and hit the clutch, it goes away.
It also only happens when there's a load on:
removing my foot from the gas, or going downhill,
its quiet.
Both rear wheels spin freely when jacked.
This is a metal-on-metal knock, quite loud,
obviously doing major damage.
The frequency is about 1 beat per rotation
of the axle.

Prior to the constant noise, there was
a clunking sound that used to happen sometimes
when I was turning.

What might I look for? Any suggestions on
what this may be? I can't drive it again until
I find it so I'm incented :)

CV?
Bearing?
Transmission?

&gt;From reading the archives, it would appear one
of the CV's is the main suspect. How would I tell
which?
