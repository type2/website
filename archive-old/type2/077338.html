Subject: RE: [T2] rear suspension woes

Blake,

This is right up our alley.

This part is called a radius arm. The Part number that you are looking for
is 211 501 066 J this is the right radius arm and fits the years 1968-1971.
The radius arm changed at the end of 1971. This is a bit involved but
doable. The biggest problem would be if the pivot bushing froze. This part
can be seen our web site under Rear Axle and then Double Jointed axle. Let
me know if you have any other questions. If you need this part let me know
we have them. Just a bolt up under the body and a few bolts to the back of
the wheel bearing housing.

Subject: [T2] rear suspension woes


Howdy,

I seem to have a large sort of problem on the rear end
of my '71 Westy.  I have tried (unseccessfully) to
figure out the names of the parts so I don't sound
like an idiot, but here goes.  Behind the brake
backing plate, there is an arm which goes toward the
front.  This arm has a cup on it, facing up, which
should catch a rubber thing located on a separate arm.
 The driver's side set up is OK, the passenger side is
not.  Where the cup should be - it isn't.  The arm is
there but the edges of the cup which extend beyond the
arm are gone.  So I am going to try to replace this.
My questions:

1.  What is the part number of this thing?

2.  Will the same part from a '73 work on a '71?

3.  Is this extrememly difficult? (I couldn't find
anything discussing it in either Muir or Bentley)

4.  How the hell do I get that thing off?  It appears
I pretty much have to tear down everything around it,
brakes, bearings, the arm that goes to the torsion
bars, etc.  Is there an easier way?  I want to do it
right, but I'd rather not work on it all winter.

Any information about this would help, as I am not
really looking forward to this.  However, when its all
done, my rear suspension should be all nice and
POR-15'd.

Thanks

Blake
