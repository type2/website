Subject: Q: What kind of trailer hitch for my '72 camper? -Reply

I know, I know.  You might think I'm nuts for towing ANYTHING with my
bus!  Don't worry.  It's a lightweight and small boat on a small trailer and
I'll only be towing it 1.5 miles once in the Spring and then again in the Fall.

Having said that, does anyone know about any kind of hitch that will
mount to my bus without replacing the stock '72 bumper?

I believe that we sell trailer hitches for all buses 72 and up...
I send you a part number and price next time I go into work...
