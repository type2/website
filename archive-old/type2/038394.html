&gt; Sorry, probably been covered before, but wondering if the electronic

&gt; milage.  I'm getting 10mpg now. Also this will cause some sluggishness.
&gt; Can I use an elec ignition, say pertronix, to counter these things? if
&gt; not do they remanufacture the vacuum, or do i have to buy used?

i'm using an 009 on my 71 and i get 20 MPG, you have more wrong than just
your distributor... Also, are you sure your odo and speedo are accurate...
that will throw off your MPG figures and give you a false sense of
despair/optimisim depending on the direction of the error...

take care,

Steve
