Subject: Re: fuel sender wire info request

It seems to me that you should be able to reconnect the wire without having
to cut anything. Just remove the firewall and you should be able to reach
the sender.  It's not like you have to remove the sender...
Well, I'm assuming you have a '73 or later bus with access to the engine
compartment from the top. If not, go ahead and cut as Mark suggested and you
might as well make to hole large enough to be able to remove the sender.
