&gt; Hi, I am looking for the light over the license
&gt; plate for a 1972 bus. Does 
&gt; anyone have one. I have one from a different year
&gt; and it doesnt fit, so Im 
&gt; pretty sure 72 is the only one that will fit, thanks

Measure your screw holes from center to center. They
should be 140mm. Same as 72 to 79. 68 to 71 were 130mm.
