Subject: trade CD Changer and Amp for Carb

subject line says it all but i will say a little more anyways...LOL..
i need a new carb my weber progressive is shot...////
doesnt matter if it is the same carb or not..?
mines just worn out...even after rebuilding it 
i have a pioneer cd changer only missing the cd magazine for it which you can get for it for a couple of bucks...
and i also have a SMALL AMP....(would have to look at the name on it...)
i have a new( cd)stereo that suits me fine ,.. so i am willing to trade this for a carb or cash if anyone is interested,....
i have a brand new engine and am busted .....but must have a diffrrent carb......
i will be at everybus for its worth...
thanks 
peace
Chris
