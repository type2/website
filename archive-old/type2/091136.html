Subject: Re: [T2] folding tire

only two words came to my poor little befuddled mind when i saw the
inflated pic...

*thunk!*  &quot;HOLY S**T!!!!&quot;
(the thunk was my jaw hitting my computer desk)

how does it all STRETCH so much??? and how long did it take to air that
thing up? an hour? has anyone demonstrated this to the &quot;ripley's believe
it or not&quot;? i have seen some strange things on that TV show... but seeing
this tire turn into THAT!!! WOW!

chris, still in shock
70 westy, with a NORMAL spare tire on the nose...
