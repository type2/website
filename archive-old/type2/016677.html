&gt; 
&gt; Why preheat the carb air?  Does it make a difference in a FI system?
Scott:
I guess I'll try to tackle this one. Yes, you're right most FI's are
tolerant enough to not need preheated air-most( have you ever seen a
75-mid 76 bus AFC?). It's the same reason late 356-912-911 Porsches
don't need pre-heat or chokes or exhaust gas-heated manifolds:There's no
opportunity for gas to puddle and give poor distribution. Single carb
systems on vw's and (all larger 6&amp; 8-cyl. engines) make up for puddling
and poor distribution with massively overrich conditions while choking.
Oldtimers with handchokes always warned about washing down cylinder
walls with raw gas fom using too much choke. This is particularly
relevant to progressive weber 2-bbl conbersions on type 4 engines-
without heat under the carb to boil off puddling and pre-heat too, these
conversions will never work at idle and off-idle conditions. Sure,
they'll work at larger throttle openings and warm temperatures, but they
are not good for commuter cars. FI and multi-carb setups on the other
hand work quite well, particularly when there is 1 barrel per cylinder
like a Porsche, no chokes needed!
You're right about the denser cold air. Carbs work on volume and engines
are dependant upon mass and they aint the same thing. Remember back to
physics class (33 years for me):something called Boyle's law?
That's why last generation carbed cars and trucks(I'm thinking now of
non-VW vehicles) had all kinds of hoses and valves and sensors. Prior to
1971 manufacturers could just get mixtures in the ballpark and they'd
err on the rich side cause that's where it ran nice! 71-75 cars had
terrible driveability until electronic FI came along and let them meter
very precise stoichiometric air-fuel ratios. Mass air sensors were
another leap forward because flapper boxes measure volume and not mass.
I guess VW figured we with type 2's and vanagons weren't quite ready for
thes big boys yet!(didn't feel the need to spend the money-they were too
busy trying to design waterboxer head gaskets to fail every two years so
to keep the dealers in boat payment money). There, how's that for a nice
concise answer-puddlin fuel.
