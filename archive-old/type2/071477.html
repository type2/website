If any one is interested, and has at least 7K to burn, there is a '76
Westfalia for sale on ebay, says under 50K original miles. Minimum bid is is
$7,000.00. There is also an '84 Westy, &quot;hard to find pop-top model&quot; ( hard to
find?) for $4,000.00. Now for the comment: the '76 is located in California.
It used to be the west/southwest was the place to find good rust free VW's at
sane prices. Not anymore. Lately, it seems the price madness has spread west.
I've seen several late 70's Westys here on the east coast that sellers said
they  bought out west and drove back, all for sale in the 7-8K price range.
Looks like the west coast folks have caught on.    Jeff S.
