I need to get new tires for my 71' Westy and I'm looking for
recommendations.  I plan to do a road trip this summer through both the U.S.
and Mexico and want to make sure that I have good all around tires that will
hold up well through a wide variety of different terrain (especially on the
roads in Mexico).  I don't want to give up fuel mileage, speed and ride
comfort on open paved roads, so I would prefer to stay away from oversized
and/or heavily treaded tires.  Any recommendations (e.g. brand, size, etc.)?

Thanks.
