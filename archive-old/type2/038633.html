Subject: Must disagree - Re: Automatic to Standard conversion

Hey all,
 I have a first hand account of the auto to manual conversion.  It's not
that difficult ( &amp; I have a hard time ajusting valves;-)
The first thing I did was get a moderately wrecked bus that had 4 flats
&amp; was being used as a storage building.  I extracted the manual linkage,
etc (along w/ a lot of FI hardware - I was converting my bus back to FI
as well).  I was already planning on purchasing a rebuilt standard
trans, so I did not need the manual trans in the bus.

My reasons for the switch were :
I had always wanted a manual ( good reason to start with ;-)
Julia &amp; I had taken the bus cross country w/ it as an automatic.  I
personally didn't care for the shifting &amp; general *feel* going up the
hills/mountains.  More than that, I didn't like the feel even more
coming down the mountains.
W/the manual trans, I love winding through the mountains using the trans
as a driving tool.  Especially forest service roads, etc.  I just never
really felt that great in her when she was an auto (I will also admit
that I have re-done the entire brake system &amp; suspension system since
the std conversion, and all of that work has greatly helped the handling
as well.)  Gas mileage was another point, but when it was an auto it was
also carburated.  SO, there are multiple variables to consider in each
condition.  But I think that the buses were meant to be standard drives
- It just feels better to me.

What I did:
I know I will miss a bunch of points, but e-mail me if you want more
details.
Pedal assembly.
Take a look at the pedal assembly.  Figure out how it fits and works (do
this for all the other linkage parts one at a time)
Disconnect the pedal from the assembly, loosen the clutch cable at the
trans. pull the cable out of the mecahnism in the front.  The pedal
mechanism assembly is bolted to the frame.  Loosen 2 bolts and take it
off.  Pull the clutch cable completely out of the tube. (You should
purchase a new cable - make that 2, you'll want a new spare).  In your
automatic, the holes w/ the nuts welded to the frame already exist.  The
hole for the pedal is also there. It is just covered by a grommet (I say
this with confidence, but I have only looked at 2 autos.  Both of them
are as I describe, but I have limited experience - feedback??

Shifter
The shifter is bolted to the floor.   The linkage for the auto is just a
cable if I remember correct.  However the tube for the manual shifter
linkage is in place.  And the manual shifter bolts in perfect.
Disconnect the cable from the trans and from the shifter.  There will be
a few wires connected to the shifter.  one is for the illumination light
&amp; the other two are made into a switch at the shifter.  The auto will
only start when in N or P.  The mechanism to achieve this is a contacts
between the wires when the shifter is in P or N.  Straight wire this
together.  Then the bus will turn over whenever you hit the key.(You
could get fancy &amp; hook up some kind of switch to the clutch pedal or at
the trans itself that will only allow the manual to start when the
clutch is pushed in ;-)

At this point you are going to have to pull the engines &amp; trns from both
buses

Shifter linkage
The rods for the shifter linkage pull out of their housing.  Pull it out
of one, clean them, grease them, check the plastic bellows on the rods
that keep the grease in sections &amp; in place.  Then slide them into your
bus.  The linkage will fit together in the front.  You will need to bend
a little bit of metal where the shift rod bolts to the floor.  But it is
all metal under and to the sides of the shifter (under the bus)  No
cosmetic problems inside at all - well, maybe a little more air through
the clutch pedal hole.

Clutch cable tube
This was a problem.  I had to use a dremel, hacksaw, &amp; chisel to break
the weld spots to the old frame.  Find some places that you can use as a
mark for the re-installation.  such as all the places that the tube
passes through frame holes.  I slid it out - tedious.  I cannot remember
if I pulled it out the front or the back of the bus.  When I put it into
the new bus (and load it w/ grease first) I used hose clamps around the
tube on either side of it passes through any frame hole as the new
*welds*.  I told myself that I would eventually get them welded, but
it's been 40K w/out a problem.

Accelerator cable tube
The auto accelerator cable was shorter &amp; had a connect down to the
trans.  It was encased in a plastic tube.  The manual was in a metal
tube.  I extracted the metal tube, but I never used it.  I ran the
manual length cable through the old auto plastic tube &amp; then on to the
engine.  I had some extra length that I made up by slipping the cable
through a flex metal tube and  therefore added some length to the run
that the cable had to go through.  Btw - get 2 new accelerator cables -
one to use &amp; one as a spare.

Trans mounting.
All of the holes are the same.  Keep all of the hardware from the
manual.  I think the mounting plate at the nose cone may be slightly
different.  You will need to get the drive axles out of the manual.  The
auto has 2 different length shafts ( &amp; neither length will work on the
manual)  Go ahead and re-grease the CV - or inspect &amp; get new ones.  Get
new boots as well.  bolt in the CV's &amp; axles.  You will need to get the
starter from the manual.  The auto/manual starters are different &amp; not
interchangeable.  Remember the wiring, or tag it.  Bolt the clutch cable
sheath to the side of the trans.

matching:
you will need the flywheel from the old manual - get it resurfaced.
Then take the  flange off  the auto crank shaft.  put the flywheel on,
check the pilot bearing, get the clutch &amp; pressure plate &amp; new throw out
bearing.  You may also need to get a diferent ECU, if you have FI.  I
think there are 2 extra wires on the auto ECU.  Use the ECU from the
donor bus.

Sooooo,
I didn't have to do any welding, no major cutting, and not too much
precision skill.  Just a lot of observing &amp; visualizing how it *should*
be.  It did take me some time, but I was going through a lot of systems
at once.

I am exremely pleased w/the manual - 40k miles so far.
gas mileage before - auto &amp; carb - 13-14
gas mileage now - 4 spd &amp; FI  - 17-20/21 (I got 23 mpg in one 280 mile
trip)

The reason that I think the bus were meant to be standard is that the
bobies are all generically made for a manual trans.  Only the clutch
cable tube &amp; the acc cable tube are not on the auto frame.  And all the
auto components were made to fit to the manual connections, holes, etc.

I love it,
but most of all, I wanted it.
it did cost some money - but I already had too much history in that bus
to sell it &amp; buy another one just because mine was not a manual.

ymmv

take care

You wrote:

In a word, no.

I have heard exactly one third hand story of someone who actually did
this.
And I don't put much stock in third hand accounts of any kind. I checked
this
possibility out myself a few years back when I was in the market for a
new
auto tranny for my '78 Westy. The conventional wisdom from just about
everybody I've spoken with about this (including good shops like Volks
Cafe
in Santa Cruz, CA) is that the conversion would cost you considerably
more
(money and/or personal time and energy) than it would to sell your auto
bus
and buy another one that's already a manual tranny bus. And a lot of the
cost
would be labor in cutting new holes for the shifts, welding in brackets
and
tubes for the shifts and making all those square pegs fit in round
holes.

If you are a handy welder with a lot of time on your hands and
substantial
from-scratch mechanical aptitude, AND think the job would be your idea
of a
good time, AND have a ready source of the junkyard parts you'll need AND
just
can't possibly stand to part with your existing bus due to very
substantial
and personalized investments in that vehicle, then have at it. If you
are
like the rest of us, you're going to be dollars, busted knuckles and
months
ahead of the game just trading buses.

Your actual mileage may vary (but not by much).

Good luck,
