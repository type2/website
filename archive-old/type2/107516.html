Subject: Re: [T2] looking for THIS hose 

I've had some luck with finding a slightly larger hose and using teflon tape
to get a tight fit. The stuff is impervious to common solvents like gasoline
&amp; oil. It's best to retape every time you remove the hose though.

For a 76 FI it's the hose going from the S-hose to the oil breather. Mine
broke and I was wondering if this is sold by anybody new, if I should start
looking in yards, or if a non molded replacement will suffice.
