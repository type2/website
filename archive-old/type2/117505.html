&gt; So here I sit, idly wondering about my new (old) van

&gt; 
&gt; It's a 78' van with some camper goodies inside. New(er) all season
&gt; tires on it, 2 batteries, supposibly in good mechanical condition with
&gt; a block heater.

sounds good to go, 
&gt; 
&gt; Winter's get pretty cold here in Saskatchewan (Canada) and I was
&gt; wanting some input on if I can expect this thing to drive ok this fall.
&gt; Good oil and... ?  You would think an air cooled machine would love
&gt; the cold.

OPERATOR HEAT is a major shortcoming of the VW van, small engine, big
interior.  check to see if yours has a gas aux, many Cdn vans had em and
they are about the only things that really work to keep it warm.

&gt; For day to day travel I have a beater of a car but every 3-4 weeks
&gt; I have some long distance travel and it would be nice to use the VW.
&gt; (ie 7-8 hours one way)

I also got a seat heating pad that plugs into the cig lighter that is nice
too.  

&gt; Am I being unreasonable and overdemanding like my ex was?

nope but dress warm
