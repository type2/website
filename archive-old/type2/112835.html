Subject: 12V Battery (vented or not)?

Hi guys,
Ok, I've read the archive, but still!

I was told that today's batteries (12V) need higher voltage to be kept 
full and our older regulator doesn't do the job properly as to keep 
those new batteries full????

Ok, so am gonna find a older style battery like I have on mine right now 
(it as a vent/breather on 1 side and it's about 4 years old-99 on it), 
so I went to my local part store and the guy told me that he don't know 
what am talking about and my current battery is a standard battery with 
a &quot;vent&quot;..... Ggggrrrrr....

I want to go &quot;dual&quot;, I want to put the new battery as the &quot;main&quot; and the 
older one as a backup with the relay! That it that all, I don't need a 
theory on how everything work inside a battery but only if some of you 
guys are using today's battery with yesterday regulator in your bus, if 
so, is it working properly?

Or! Which company make the &quot;Vented&quot; old style one???

My alternator is the 55amp one

Thank you gentlemen's
Ben
