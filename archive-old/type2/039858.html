Subject: Canvas install- why not screw bottom first????

Hi Marvin, I'm just removing my top canvas now- noticed that the orginal
was pulling out a bit here and there (see staples showing between
plastic outer and wooden underneath- does the canvas get tighter with
age??)  -Working &quot;around the corner&quot; to staple the top first and then
trying to get the right tension/alignment on the bottom with the top
partially down seems ass backwards.....seems easier in reverse, do the
bottom first, when you can see what's happening, then staple the top
under desired tension while sitting inside, working from centers to
corners.  Then finish with the strip over that, or use any decorative
trim/webbing/fringe from SO-FRO fabrics.  Only downside is it will show
from the inside when up- but way up there, who cares- anyone else do it
this way or care to comment on this method??
