Subject: Re: [T2] i saw another commerical with a beetle / and i have a
  bus question

I have a 67 ghia vert that I'm restoring now that has been in more then 20  
movies. It belongs to an individual, not a movie compony. He has told me that  
the people that make the movies knows that there were/are alot of aircooled 
VW's  out there and when they make a movie that took place in the 60'and 70's 
that  they want them in the movies so its more realistic.
