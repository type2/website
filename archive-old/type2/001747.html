Come over and chat with us bus people on IRC.   You might
find me there on some weeknights from 6-8pm Pacific time.
Server:  irc.type2_dot_com  or  irc.digital-galaxy_dot_net
Channel:  #buslist

Have a look at the web page I built one afternoon.  You'll
find it is mostly photos.  It's very simple; like the good olde
days of Mosaic.   URL is below.    Have a nice weekend!
