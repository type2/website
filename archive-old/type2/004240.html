The headliner in my'71 bus is totally intact and in really good cond. except
its stained -and resists all attempts to clean .I'm aware of the problems of
putting in a new headliner and the necessity not to get it too wet when
cleaning it(rusty roof inside).Any one got any ideas on restoration anyone
with experience of painting using 'Plasticote' paint as someone suggested
