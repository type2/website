Subject: RE: Fuel return line on fuel injection 1700

&gt;I removed the pollution control &quot;spider&quot; from my gas
&gt;tank on my 1973 bus. I put rubber caps on the two
&gt;tubes that stick out of the tank where the spider used
&gt;to be. Suppose I did install a fuel injection
&gt;system... Could I install the fuel return line in one
&gt;of those two tubes that stick out?

Ah.  Another problem that I weighed myself a few years back when I put FI on my 
73.  I thought about this long and hard since my original tank was in perfect 
condition and the FI tanks I had access to were moderately ugly.  I finally 
decided against it because of the increased turbulance and in-tank vapor this 
would cause.  

If you're not sure what I mean, try pouring Coca-Cola into a glass by pouring 
it carefully down the edge of the glass.  Not too much foam.  Now try pouring 
it from 15&quot; above the glass.  OK, so gasoline doesn't foam like Coke, but 
you're still going to be creating a lot of air bubbles.  Not to mention the 
increased vapors floating around in there which seems like it would cause the 
gas to evaporate faster and create more gas-smell outside the bus.

I still say, if you're going to go to all the trouble of fitting FI, why not 
spend a few bucks for a decent used tank with the proper tubes on it.
