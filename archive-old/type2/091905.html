Subject: Re: [T2] 77 bus disc brake bleeding

Whoa- in my experience, a pump of the pedal pushes out about a cc from
the tubing.....I always assumed that with a slow pedal push (not a
tromp) the open bleeder causes no hydraulic pressure to induce pressure
against the springs of the wheel cylinder (rear brakes).  Thus the rear
shoes should not push out?

&gt; Now... the real reason for the post...  the one thing that no one tells
&gt; you is that to successfully bleed brakes, at least by the pumping the
&gt; pedal method, you need to adjust the rear shoes hard against the drums!
&gt; This is true whether you are bleeding the rears or the fronts.  The MC
&gt; piston moves a grand total of maybe 1 cc in a stroke.  If the rear shoes
&gt; have motion, then 90% of that cc will go to moving the rear shoes against
&gt; the drums, then the remaining pittance will push air out.  It goes 10x as
&gt; fast if you use the whole stroke to push air out!  (and, face it, rear
&gt; brake shoes *always* need adjusting :-)
