chad colwell sends:

&gt; i HANE A 79' WESTY W/typacal RUST, UNDER WINDOWS,BEHIND REAR BUMPER. hOW LONG
&gt; WOULD A GOOD PAINT/PREP. JOB LAST WHEN DRIVING ONLY SUMMERS LITTLE RAIN, LAST
&gt; BEFORE RUST REAPPEARS, typically?

Remove the windows and rear bumper and get rid of the rust. (Also look close
at the bottom three inches of the Vanagon.) You will be much happier with
the final result.
