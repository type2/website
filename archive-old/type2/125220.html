Subject: Bus shocks

I saw a post a while back but can't find it in the archives.

It listed the shocks used on a bus.  2 were for the front and 2 for the 
back.

One of them was the KYB gas adjust but the other was something else and I 
don't remember which was which anyway.

Would anyone happen to remember the post or know the info?  I thought it 
might have been Richard Atwell but couldn't find it on his site.  Great site 
by the way.  :)

Thanks in advance,
Snoopy
