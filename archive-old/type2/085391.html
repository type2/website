Subject: Re: [T2] A &quot;NEW&quot; '68 Crewcab?

Hi Volks,

In 1980 my mom owned a 1971 westy that had the 73+ turnsignals up high on
the nose.

It had been in an accident and the whole nose was replaced with the later
73+ design. It still had a 71 bumper, and everything else were still 1971
issue.


Happy trails,

&gt; It looks to me that the front turn signals are in the wrong place.
&gt; They should be next to the bumper. In 1972 VW moved the turn signals
&gt; up next to the air intake.  However, I did once own a 1971 bus that
&gt; had the newer style front turn signals. That has always been a mystery
&gt; to me. Anybody know the story on that? The rear tail lights on that bus
&gt; were correct for 1971.
