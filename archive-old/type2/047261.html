&gt; &gt;I put them back in with plenty of grease, I like to use CV joint grease. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I used grease but can't figure out why everyone says to.  They slid in 
&gt; just fine without grease during the trial fit.

I prefer a synthetic grease for cables. It doesnt gum up, turn to putty,
breakdown or pick up moisture as readily as conventional grease.
