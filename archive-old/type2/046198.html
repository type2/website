Deltano, Jeff &lt;JDeltano_at_NidecPG_dot_com&gt;queries:

&gt; I am heading up to Vermont from Mass this weekend for some
&gt; hiking+camping. I remember someone mentioning a VW Junkyard in Vermont. I
&gt; need just a few more things to get Schlampig on the road. Does anyone have
&gt; an address or Phone # for this place?

John's Car Corner--US RT. 5, Westminster, VT.  Take I-91 to exit 4 and go
north on 5 or Exit 5 and go south.  802-722-3180  They close at 1 PM on
Saturday.
