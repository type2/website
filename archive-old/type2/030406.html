&gt; Not to start an argument, but how did the German's do it on the original
&gt; covers?? The wire was in them when I took the old covers off.   Maybe I am

*nod*  I dont know how the germans do it.;)  They still do, btw.  New
Beetle seat covers still have a few sections with sewn-in wire.  I'm sure
one could hand feed the wire into the channel, but it definitly adds a bit
of labor to the whole ordeal.

Most OE manufactures of seat covers (cloth or leather) have more solid
rods that they use. (ie: toyota camry, avalon, corolla; honda accord,
prelude, etc rear seat bottoms.)  2-4 sections of rod that is slid into the 
channel afterwards.

None of the Aftermarkeet manufactures that I've dealt with do this, they
just sew the cord in, which makes it much easier on we monkeys who have to
put their covers on!:)


&gt; not seeing something here, but I believe when you, not meaning you
&gt; personally, but when a company states they make or build to the original
&gt; OEM, doesn't that mean to original factory standards??

*nod*  I would agree, yes.  Unfortunetly, it doesnt always work that
way.:(  Call them and bitch!:)  I'm always chewing our sales rep's behind
everytime he comes around, for quality issues. (both Katzkin and Classic
Soft Trim)  Occasionally, I'll even see the problems corrected on the next
kit!:)

good luck!
