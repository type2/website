Subject: [T2] late model bus oil plate = 914  w/ sender hole?

can anyone confirm or refute this:

i have heard that the oil plate on the bottom of a porsche 914 engine will
fit the later model air cooled bus engines (you know, that plate on the
bottom with the little bump and 2 bolts), that the 914 engines came with oil
temp senders factory installed, and that the sender hole is the same size as
the vdo sender for their oil temp gauge (9/16&quot; dia).

(it would be great to prebake one of these, a la julia child, for an
installation next oil change. no fuss, no mess.)

thanks,
victor
