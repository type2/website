Subject: Need a thermostat

After stripping down the engine in my 80 Westy I have discovered the 
thermostat has failed. If my memory serves me right the type 2 
thermostats went NLA a couple of years ago. I recall some posts about 
using the type 1 thermostat in the type 2 engine. tried for the last 
hour to find reference to the required mods but found nothing but a 
bunch of debates about the value of thermostats and flaps and how to 
adjust a tstat.

Does anyone out there have a good type 2 t-stat they are willing to part 
with and/or does anyone know the needed mods to use the type 1 t-stat in 
a type 2.
Thanks
Tom
