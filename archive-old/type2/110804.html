For those of you who have never heard, or have forgotten. type2_dot_com
has a small irc server setup which allows real time communication for
those of us who don't seem to think that email is quick enough ;)

it's at irc.type2_dot_com channel #buslist

it's usually pretty durn slow, but every once in a while there are
several people on. consider this your very own personal invite 
&lt;insert name here&gt;

You can find a bit more about irc here:
