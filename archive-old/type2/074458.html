I really need to sell my 82 westy.  Here is the scoop.  I was asking =
$5000OBO.  I have lowered it to $4000OBO.  Let's see what kind of =
response that gets.  I really like this bus but finances are forcing me =
to sell it.  There are pictures at my web page listed below.  Here are a =
few details.

     1982 Vanagon L Westfalia, 4-speed, with 116K on bus &amp; 8K on motor.  =
Compression is 115PSI all around.  Lot of things have been done to this =
bus in the year I have had it.  I have receipts for almost everything I =
have done.  Everything works &amp; works well.  All screens, curtains, =
cushions are in very good shape.  There are a few dings that the =
pictures show.  Tires, AFM, cold start valve, front brakes(VW), small =
vacuum hoses, coil, Pertoronix, fuel tank vent lines &amp; grommets, clutch =
slave cylinder, clutch, pilot bearing, windsheild &amp; seal &amp; much more.  =
Email me for more details.  Thanks.
