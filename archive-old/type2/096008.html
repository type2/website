Subject: Don't scrap your Buses!



Hello everyone,

In reference to a recent post concerning a bus for sale, I did a follow-up
and found the bus had been trashed.  Please - don't scrap your buses or
beetles!!  Personally I am from Quebec, Canada where buses, yet alone spare
parts are extremely hard to find.

If anyone is looking for a good safe home for their old vehicles,
non-running or running, I can provide a great place and genuine TLC for the
vehicle.  It is a shame to send away these buses to the scrapper as they
become less and less available!!

Thank you,
Shawn
Montreal, Quebec.
