&gt;I don't know what you guys are talking about.  I've been in Colorado for

Uh, Mike... your engine is making way more power than a stock motor.  I have driven the same passes you have and my bus's already meager hp was reduced by about 1/2 at the summit.  It was also idling really rough.  Not saying it's not do-able but for *most* of us, well... our busses feel the effects of elevation.
