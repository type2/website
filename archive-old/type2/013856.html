Subject: gears

Sounds like the plate that is at the base of the shifter
needs
to be adjusted. This plate is what controls the action of
the shifter and is a adjustment plate... it cant just be
bolted back down. The manual describes how to do it... or
if the archives are up there is a couple of write ups on
it. I am at work or I would look it up for you.
