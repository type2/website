Subject: Re: [T2] 72 Camper Question

Hi Mark,

You might both be right. As others have mentioned, the 1.7L dual-carb  
&quot;pancake&quot; engine was the only configuration sold in North America.  
However, it is possible that the bus you're looking at might be an  
import from another market where the 1600cc engine was used. It's  
also possible that the engine is a transplant. It's also possible  
that the bus is actually a 68-71 model and has been mislabelled as a  
72 for some reason.

Does that mean that the engine has to be replaced? Not necessarily.   
It depends on your needs and intentions.

If you are looking to perform a concours restoration, then you need  
to verify what motor was originally in that vehicle. the M-code plate  
would be your best bet for that, since it identifies the delivery  
port, and therefor the target market. Hint: Wide-5 wheels indicate  
you're looking at a 68-1970 model. Square rear turn signals and the  
lack of an above-engine access hatch indicate a true 1972 model.

If you are simply looking for a driver/camper/commuter, then the only  
thing that really matters is if the engine is in good running order  
and is properly installed. Check to make sure the engine has a rear  
bearer bar. Without one you are over-stressing the transmission  
brackets. Check to make sure the cooling tin and seals are all in  
place. Check the oil level and condition. Check the compression. If  
everything checks out OK, then just drive it and don't sweat the  
small stuff.

You will get a LOT of opinions on this list about what's right and  
what isn't.  The 1600 engine enjoys better aftermarket support. The  
type4 engine (pancake) has a better torque curve to power a bus.

Here's a good page to explain the M-code:

Happy Trails,

&gt; I looked at a non-running 72 camper today that had a 1600cc motor.  
&gt; I thought
&gt; they came standard with a 1700cc. The owner said the motor was  
&gt; original.
&gt; I'm interested in buying the bus, but not if I'm going to have to  
&gt; replace the
&gt; engine.
&gt; Is he correct or am I?
