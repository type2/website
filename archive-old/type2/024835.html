Not affliated with anyone....

Went to Midas the other day to have a complete replacement of my exhaust on
the T*y*ta. Saw a bug up on the lift. Said to the guy, you replace Bug
Mufflers? He said, veery slowly, yes, we do. I pondered this for a moment,
and asked the inevitable question: do you guarantee them for life? He
paused, looking unhappy, and answered slowly, yes. I asked how much and he
said $100. (how much is a bus muffler german issue for a 68-71? About $90) I
thought to myself gold mine! Ok I don't have a bug. I have a bus, I don't
like mechanics, I do it all myself, but what if they could do the work for
me?
I know we are all a special group of individuals, who rely on our own work,
but what if the midas company is our &quot;stainless muffler&quot;? My mind reels with
the thought.
I will have to work up alot of courage to take the 69, 70 and 63 to the
shop, but I cant help but see the value here!
Your Thoughts?
Jason S.
