Subject: Brake light battle continues

I have been battling the electrical system in my 69 for some time. It's really 
just all the different lighting, I can get high/low headlights to work and all 
of the turn signals but my brake lights are still giving me trouble. I did get 
them to come on when the pedal is depressed but for some reason the dual 
filament thing is not working in the bulb(1157). Seems like only one of the 
filaments is working. When the parking lights are on and the brake lights are 
activated the same filament that was on for the parking lights just gets 
brighter instead of the other filament lighting up. Same for the turn signals. 
I know the wiring is clean, hooked up right and bulbs are good. Any body run 
into this before? Any suggestions? Thanks
