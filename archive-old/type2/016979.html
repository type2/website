&gt; A final note...I've never had much success in getting a poorly operating
&gt; carburetor to work properly by &quot;rebuilding&quot; it.  The &quot;rebuild&quot; kits
&gt; normally have gaskets, accelerator diaphragm and float.  Unless the
&gt; diaphragm or float is your problem the kit doesn't really do anything.
&gt; Carburetors are full of little passages and I think over time they get
&gt; clogged.  I've soaked the entire carb in nasty solvents for days, blown
&gt; compressed air everywhere I could and still couldn't the things to work
&gt; properly.  One time I finally broke down and bought a new carb and I was
&gt; back in business.  Am I just unskilled or unlucky, or a carburetors
&gt; tempermental things that are difficult to set straight once they are
&gt; messed up?

Mark:
I have never found a carb I couldn't rebuild and get to work pretty
good. It helps to understand what every little thing does, but if you
understand venturis and air pressure and LOGIC, then you can figure out
what is supposed to happen, then deduce why it ain't. Experience helps,
because most carbs experience similar failings. Floats sink, accel pumps
deteriorate, idle and main jets get plugged with debris, needle and seat
assy's get fouled  with debris (and flood), transition jets with carbon
or varnish, base gaskets fail, and of course throttle shafts wear.
1/2 to 2/3 of problems blamed on carbs are, in reality, something else.
When I was 20 years old I bought a 60 Corvette with fuel injection. A
good friend of mine (and the best automotive machinist I've ever known)
told me that most of these wonderful units were taken off because of
problems other than the fuel injections. I think that holds true for
most carbs. (I still have the Corvette- the FI still works fine, 30
years later).
The toughest carbs I ever worked on were on a 73 bus w/automatic. It was
never right till I replaced the dual vacuum advance with a new one. I
tried 009's, earlier type 1's, 356 Porsche distributors, NOTHING worked
except the stock setup, set on stock specs. Everything else would either
have too high idle or poor off-idle characterics (not cool with the
automatic). I think that the dual advance made it work right.
The dual vacuum advance is in reality an advance and a retard. The
retard side is connected under the throttle butterfly to respond to
MANIFOLD vacuum. Under proper setup this only comes into play at idle
and trailing throttle. At idle, the timing is set so that firing takes
place around 5degrees AFTER tdc. This is not a normal timing and the
engine would be much happier firing 10-15 degrees sooner. I'm sure this
timing was necessary to reduce NOx or some other smog component. So
there is your engine idling along, kind of laboring actually, you've set
the idle mixture so it will at least keep running. Now you give it a
little tap on the gas pedal , the manifold vacuum drops to near zero,
the vacuum retard immediately goes away, and your engine gets an
immediate 15 degree kick in the advance in addition to a little more air
and fuel from the accelerator pump. I'm sure that 
somebody that knows carbs could have made it work by increasing main  or
idle jet size, idle air correction jets, emulsion tubes or something.
Webers have 4 or 5 replaceable parts that will change these
characteristics. I'm not THAT much of an expert, I'm just trying to get
the damn thing to run so I can get it out the door! I am blessed with
the knowledge that if it ran that bad in 73, NO ONE would have ever
bought it! After changing the advance and setting it up accordin to the
book, those elderly carbs outlasted 2 more engines!
