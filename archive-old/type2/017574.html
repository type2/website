Subject: fast up a hill in a bus?
Message-ID: &lt;3706C6C8.50F7_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

&gt; Is there anything I could do to 
&gt; this engine to give her more power but still keep her fairly simple and 
&gt; stock,or would it be better to just go for a bigger VW engine from a 
&gt; later '70's bus?I want to be able to get up hills on the highway at a 
&gt; somewhat normal speed(ie.-not 40mph)


Why in the world would you want to go faster up a hill.  I just loves
pissing all those people off...Cheap thrills, y'know.

sorry, I couldn't resist.
