Subject: Break light coming on

hey now,

engine still running great after the rebuild 80 miles ago! :-) brake 
light is coming on though. when i crank the engine it comes on and 
doesn't go off until i hit the brakes. then it may or may not
come on again and goes off when i hit the brakes. then it won't
come on for the rest of the day. brakes are good, i've got fluid,
new pads were put on during the rebuild. this happened sporadically
since i bought the van a year ago. could it be an electrical problem?
i know it would come on and stay on when i had a burned out turn 
signal once. but i don't have one now.
