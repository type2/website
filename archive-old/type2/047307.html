Subject: [T2] Firewall Tin

	Hello everybody

I pulled the 1600dp engine in my 70 Westy a while back because I noticed,
while doing a compression check, that the firewall rubber seal was in real
bad shape. There was realy nothing left of it. When I pulled the engine I
also noticed that I had a combination of dual port and single port tin on
the cylinders. I found and installed the correct tin on the cylinders, so
now my spark plug seals will do the job intended. I have also replaced the
rubber firewall seal in the engine compartment. From looking and matching up
the firewall tin to the engine compartment, I cannot see how it can make an
airtight seal. The firewall tin I have does not follow the same shape as the
engine compartment. Not even close on the corner radius. So, my question is,
do I have the wrong tin ? Could I have bug tin instead of bus tin ? Could
anyone point me to where I might find a picture of the proper firewall tin
and does any body in southern MA have one they can part with ? I am all set
to finnaly put the engine back in and drive the bus, but I do not want to
cook a good engine because of not having a tight engine compartment. Thanks
in advance for the Info.
