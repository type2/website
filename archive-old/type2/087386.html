Subject: mixture and bypass screws

Please help me understand the  34 PICT-3 carb by doing the following 
multiple choice test.

The bypass screw allows more or less  	AIR	FUEL 	to enter the venturi.

The mixture screw allows more or less		AIR	FUEL 	to 
enter the venturi.

Or...... is it not this straightforward?

The cutaway drawings on p 10 of the Green Bentley have me confused.

Thanks, Jack
