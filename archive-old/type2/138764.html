Subject: cht wiring

What is considered to be the best place for a cht guage sensor lead to exit
the tin when the sensor is under spark plug #3. This will be on a 1980 engine,
doesn't have the hole through tin for the factory temp sensor for the F.I.
Sensor. I am concidering drilling a hole through the tin near the plug access
and using a tight fitting rubber gromett to keep cooling air where it
belongs.
Thanks
Tom
