Just a thought, which may not be completely appropriate to the bus list...

I am looking for a VW 412 in fair-good condition to be my daily driver, so 
we can preserve the Westy for camping. Do any of you have one or know of 
one that I could buy?

Motor can be blown, but all the ancillary parts must be there. The rest 
(body, interior, and accoutrements) should be in decent shape, and intact. 
It will be restored to &quot;daily driver&quot; condition so some imperfections are 
okay.

Wish list: located less than two days drive from NC, A/C, Auto tranny, and 
aux. heater, cream or red color, 1973 or 1974. Price negotiable. Look out 
your window...is there one in the yard that your spouse has been ragging 
you to ditch?
