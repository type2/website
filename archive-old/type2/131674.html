Subject: RE: [T2] Bolt &amp; Nut Sizes -- 2nd Post

Hey Jason,

You should check with Wes Brown and see if he has them. Give him a call 
aroud 6PM he should be home. He knows some guys in Fletcher(I think) that 
have some parts buses to find the brake nut thingamabob you are looking for. 
Did you try Whitey at German Automotive up there? NAPA carries quite a bit 
of the metric stuff and if they don't have it they can get it quickly.

Do you have a Bentley? Engine and Clutch Pg. 87, there is some help there, 
not much.

&gt;Muffler Bolts - bolts, nuts, washers?  Easy to fake a replacement, but I'd 
&gt;like to get it right.

Muffler to heat exchanger - self-locking nut M8 - I would say the pitch is 
1.25 and the length about 20mm. If this is right, which you could mock it up 
to make sure before you buy all of them the bolts, would be M8 X 20mm X 
1.25, Nut would be selflocking if you can find it M8 with the same pitch 
1.25 and an M8 sized lock washer.

&gt;Tinware Screws - hex head or flat head

Pick the head you want, these are M6 X 12mm X 1.25, see below Part B under 
engine tin.
