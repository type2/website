Subject: [T2] Cooling Tin Grommets &amp; Alt. Elbow

Does anyone know where to get a new rubber alt. elbow? This is the elbow
between the alt. and the fan housing. Bus-boys say NLA with part#
021-903-655B.  However, I googled 022-903-655 and found one (Automobile
Atlanta) for a 914 but $30! and a few pages in German. Or can I glue this
one back together?

Does anyone know or have a list of all the rubber grommets in the cooling
tin and engine area? A list with part #'s and descriptions would be great.
I
know this is a long shot.
