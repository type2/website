Subject: Re: [T2] EMPI muffler installation

Mike,

I can't imagine anyone using sealer on exhaust gaskets...never seen it 
done either.  Even the red stuff is goona burn off pretty much right away.
Most exhaust gaskets are made of some sort of asbestos or metal that 
shouldn't need any sort of sealer whatsoever.


Not familiar with that exact muffler, but as they kinda &quot;hang&quot; a lot, you 
get quite a bit of bouncing around, so you also a lot of need for keeping 
them tight against the header pipe in some way....or mounted to something
that won't let them bounce around  lot.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Is anyone who's on-line at the moment familiar with this particular muffler?
&gt; A few questions...

&gt; 2. I've been advised to use hi-temp (red) silicone sealer on both sides of
&gt; the gasket.  I also plan on wire brushing all contact surfaces on the
&gt; manifold before installing the new muffler.  Good ideas?
