Subject: Manual control of heater fan
Date: Sun, 18 Mar 2001 16:41:26 +0000

I have effected a cunning modification to Sally's heating system that I
thought I'd share because I've not heard of anyone else doing it.
It annoys me that it is not obvious whether or not the booster fan is
running:  Lever almost all the way down = off, lever all the way down = on.
Also, it would be nice to have max heat all the time and turn the fan on
and off without messing with the lever.  So I took the wire off the lever
terminal and connected it to a switch, then connected the other end of the
switch to ground.  Close switch, fan comes on - easy.  I just have the
switch dangling under the dash at the moment while I trial the system, but
it seems to work well.  This mod can be put back to stock at any time with
no permanent alteration to the wiring.
