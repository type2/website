Subject: Re: [T2] distributor drive gear backwards situation

&gt;With the distributor spun around 180* and the cables crossed, you 
&gt;essentially have a double negative

When the dist is 180 degrees out, you can correct the firing order by swapping the cables but then you loose the ability to adjust the timing when the vacuum can collides with something. If you don't have a vacuum can dizzy, you can get away with it.

&gt;Now, as far as lining up the distributor drive gear (which I would 
&gt;verify regardless), there is a way to do this, but I forget how.  If I 
&gt;remember correctly, the bentley shows what the distributor gear should 
&gt;like like at #1 tdc (I think).

Pictures in my FAQ:

&gt;Now this is assuming, of course, that the distributor drive dog is 
&gt;installed correctly.  In the event that the distributor is really out 
&gt;180*, you can always flip the drive dog on the bottom of the dizzy 
&gt;instead of pulling out the gear
&gt;
&gt;I think the above is right.  Could someone please confirm?

Right. It's safer than trying to remove the gear and washer without it falling into the case but it's also a pain to remove that little pin.

You could try to pull out the drive pinion and hope the oil keeps the washer attached to it (or the base it sits on). I think there was a discussion not too long ago that said the washer normally falls into a &quot;safe&quot; region of the case. If that happens then you need a spare washer and some practive runs with the washer and some grease with the washer will help you set the pinion right (the gears are helical so you have to put the gear in offset and watch it twist into position).
