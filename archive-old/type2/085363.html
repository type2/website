Subject: Part inquiry and advice

Two questions for experts:

In this picture, does anyone know what the white cuffs at the end of the
heat exchanger control boxes are called?  They looks like asbestos or
something.  I'd like to replace them.

In this one, I'm trying to clean the front of the case.  Is this magnesium
because it's not responding to Aluminum polish?  What will clean this up?
