Subject: Smog (was 2004 calendar)

From: Richard Atwell &lt;ratwell_at_mac_dot_com&gt;

&gt;Billy knows the smog system probably better than &gt;anyone. Lost of info in the archives.

A dubious honor, at best.

My only regret? Not having seen it through, but as I mentioned to Jason off list, the new owners dumped $2K into her to get thru and now have to smog again next year(!) even though she should be exempt on 1/1/05 because she failed twice as a gross polluter.

The AFM, muffler, catalytic converter and other parts were replaced.  I know the AFM sounds like a suspicious shop wack, but when I tested it about 2 years ago against the bentley, it was just barely in spec.

Some folks on the list seem to have had it easy in Calfornia lately with the smog check.

They got the gold mine, I got the shaft.

Billy
