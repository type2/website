Subject: carb matchup and stuff

Hi all,

Is there a practical limit to what size stock SP engine you can
use a 28 PICT before you ought to move up to a 30 PICT-X? Also,
is there anyone that I can send a carb to to get the throttle
plate bushings replaced? Oh, and one more thing, does anyone know
off-hand where to find the distributor list that tells you which
distributor was originally used in which application by part
number? I think I remember seeing it somewhere online, but I had
about 50 Bus web pages bookmarked and can't remember for the life
of me where to look again!  Thanks!
