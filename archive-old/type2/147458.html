&gt; Last January I was in Thunderbay Ontario Canada and it was -42 farehight so

&gt; also drain all the oil from the motor ad boiled it in the house, than I put
&gt; it back in the motor just before I had to start the motor. This was a very
&gt; common thing to do up north in the 1950. Then we would also boil the
&gt; antifreeze to help start the car.

I have a hard time thinking of any reason to go through that much 
trouble to drive somewhere, short of an emergency room trip. I would 
just go back in and drink some hot coffee. ;)
