Does your distributor have a centrifugal advance? If so, it sounds like the
weights in the distributor are not returning and are resulting in a high advance.
When you shut off the engine and the distributor stops spinnng altogether, the
springs can finally return the weights and the advance is normal..... until you
rev it again.

It you have a vacuum advance, it's something else!

&gt; Howdy!

&gt;         My newly recomissioned 74 is behaving badly. After it warms up, it revs
&gt; high. When cool, it idles normally. Only after driving does it rev high,
&gt; and maintain its high rpm no matter what, while running. The annoying
&gt; thing is, if I shut it off, even for 3 seconds, the idle returns to
&gt; normal. I originally thought it was a sticky choke or a sticky throttle,
&gt; but It looks fine and works fine while it runs, right up to when it
&gt; revs...
&gt;
&gt;         I have stock carbs, stock dizzy, stock everything, and the bus is a
&gt; federal bus, not a fornicalia bus...
&gt;
&gt;         Any ideas?
