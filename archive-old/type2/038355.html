Subject: Re: Carbs, FI and a change of mind

Steve makes a good point about the learning curve and the *real* --though
not necessarily monetary-- cost of understanding FI.  Also keep in mind that
the FI systems are quite old by now and need to be checked and restored.

Now some of that work is easy, requires no specialized knowledge, and will
probably restore performance in a majority of cases.
(1) Replace all fuel line with FI-rated hose, and don't forget them little
stubs right on the injectors!
(2) Replace all vacuum hoses with the _correct_ kind for a snug fit. Check
for other sources of vacuum leaks, too.
(3) Clean and check all electrical connectors for positive contact, don't
neglect ground connections.

Then there are the more expensive items: After all these years, the
injectors are probably leaking or not spraying properly and need to be
replaced ($40 a piece?), the AirFlow Meter is wearing down, the wires in the
wire harness may be getting brittle or cracked, the auxiliary air regulator
is not properly closing or opening, etc., etc. If you don't want to waste
money on unnecessary replacements, you will need to learn how to
troubleshoot/inspect/benchtest the components. Once all is running properly,
you might want to take the bus to an authorized Bosch Service and have the
AFM fine-tuned. Chances are some bozo already played with the CO adjustment
screw -- just because he could.

In the end, you (and your state's emissions laws) decide whether you go for
carbs or FI. Obviously good and properly set-up carbs will work better than
a neglected FI system and a restored FI system will run much better than
poorly pieced-together aftermarket carbs. I'd say, give your FI a chance.

For help on troubleshooting, may I suggest the HTML FI troubleshooter found
in the sig below.

Have fun!
