Subject: Re: Rear Drum Removal!

Volks,

[78 Westy Deluxe]

I'm in the process of doing my own brakes; fronts were easy, rears have been
a whole 'nother story.  Sadly, I've not the five-fingered castellated nut
remover/puller thingy of death that Bentley says is required... and checking
Muir revealed that it's &quot;usually 36mm&quot;.... guess what?  It ain't.  'Brought
a 36mm socket home to discover it's not even close.  What is the size,
anyway?  Am I approaching this from the right angle to start with?  What
MUST I do to get those bloody hubs off so I can replace shoes and cylinders?

Patiently awaiting wisdom,

Justin L. Smith
