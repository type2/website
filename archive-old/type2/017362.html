&gt; in a work vehicle, hauled VW parts all day and still does, that is
&gt; pushing 250,000 miles. They can and will last.

     My new '69 which was maintained by the VW dealer burnt it's valves in
25,000 miles. And I hate to think how many times it was rebuilt after that.
I recall one alignbore and one new case among those. Your above mentioned
parts hauler probably never left the city. Mine was mostly highway,
pedal-to-the-metal 90% of the time, with a heavily loaded vehicle --- that
just burns up a too-small engine. Any engine that is run full-throttle most
of the time will live a very short life, even big Detroit rron. With a T4
2.0L in a bus you can run 3/4 trottle and still make the speed limit most of
the time.
