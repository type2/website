While you are &quot;resetting&quot; the black box, why not just do what I did? Remove 
it from the speedometer input and output cables, open the box and remove the 
gears that are driven by the cables. Then reinstall it and you have a &quot;pure&quot; 
speedometer drive system, with no more gear noise from that infernal box, 
and no more annoying light every 30,000 miles. The gear noise was 
particularly nettlesome...interfered with my enjoyment of the happy &quot;hummm&quot; 
wafting from the engine compartment!
