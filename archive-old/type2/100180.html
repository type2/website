&gt; An earlier post about SP rpm's and mpg reminded
&gt; me of a question I have for you folks.  I'm
&gt; thinking about a 70 bus with a SP engine.  I've
&gt; heard lotsa claims with respect to better mileage
&gt; from this engine.  True or not?  Is this due to
&gt; the head?  Due to 28/30/31 Carbs?  Due to lower
&gt; speed due to less hp?  :)
&gt;
&gt; I've heard some claim the SP's heads last longer.
&gt;  True?
&gt;
&gt; Any comments and suggestions gladly accepted.

given the choice, I'd go single port.

my dual port runs hot despite a million things I've done to
try to fix this condition.   My next step may indeed be
to pull the 34-Pict-3 and try a 30-Pict and see if that
actually makes a difference, but I'm not holding my breath.
This, in comparison to folks with sp's I know who cruise
at 60 and have never had a temp gauge, and never blown
an engine, even when driving in the desert.

Also, when discussing having a 1600dp built, Jake Raby
said he'd rather build me a 1600sp than a dp because
he felt they were bomb-proof.
