Subject: Relay behind blower fan- where do the wires go?

on the stock wireing on my 74 I have
yellow w black stripe -- output to fan w/inline fuse
brown -- to lever arm switch (to ground)
blue -- assume it is for relay activation voltage but
not sure right now..
red -relay switched constant 12 volts.
  No black wire in the bundle. Is the fan working?
I am pretty sure the brown wire ends up at the lever
arm
switch which activates the relay.
  I removed my blower fan from the engine compartment
and
use the relay to run the bilge blower fan that is in
line
with the heat tube under the bus... so I cant say for
sure
about the fan wireing.. but as I remember the lead off
the
fan to the yellow wire on the harness was black.
  The in line fuse goes between the fan and the relay.
I can dig into it further later if that would help.
