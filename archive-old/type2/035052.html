&gt; While doing some body work on the 72 Westy I wanted to remove the

&gt; What was the purpose of this tag?
&gt; 
&gt; I also need to replace my front windshield and have not been able to
&gt; find one listed in any of the web vendors sights, any one bought one
&gt; lately, how much?

California law states that campers have to meet state standards, and
they need the tag to be sold.  I have never seen anyone actually check
for this tag at any time.  Take it off and put it in the glove box.
