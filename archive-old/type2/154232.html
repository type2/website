Subject: Photo under dash needed

I've got a '79 Westy whose previous owner didn't have clue.  Today I
reconnected all the dash vents but still have some questions that could be
answered by looking at a photo of someone's correct bus whose kick panels
are removed.  Two things I'm unsure about... 

1)  What the wiring should look like - for example, I have some relays that
are not attached to anything.

2)  My bus has an under dash A/C unit (not currently working) and I'm not
sure how the hoses to the A/C unit should be attached.

TIA and have a great weekend.
