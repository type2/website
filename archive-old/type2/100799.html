Subject: New Plastic stud locks for type IV

Jeff wrote:
The type IV engine has plastic inserts that go around the six main bolts
used to hold the case together. They keep the bolts from falling out of
the case during reassemble and when splitting the case. Anyone know
where I can get new inserts? Do they come with the gasket kit?
