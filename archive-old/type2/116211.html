Subject: another part question

Hi,

Is there some sort of clip (if so what part #) that goes on the end of
the speedo cable in the wheel hub? Mine just has a bit of silicone'ish
stuff there.

Then I have removed the step pads at the front door step. We just
painted with POR15 and top coated with a textured paint, really cool I
think. The question is do any of the suppliers have plugs to fit the
drain holes, also the holes in the back near the engine lid.

One last thing a rubber plug came from somewhere under the bus and I am
not sure where it is supposed to go. This is a crazy question but does
someone have pic's of the underside that shows where any plugs should
be.

Peace

Meg
