&gt;I just ordered a set of rebuilt heads about $180 a piece for a type 4 1776
&gt;from Bus Depot.  I asked about new and they said they refuse to sell new
&gt;because of an inherrent problem that VW never fixed with dropped valve
&gt;seats.  Is this a real problem? 

Some say it is, but personally I'm not convinced.

&gt;Well the ones Bus Depot sent ended up being
&gt;from AVP and arrived cracked where the exhaust port goes thru the head. 

If you're talking about cracks in the exhaust port where the manifold
attaches, this is not supposed to be a big deal.  Mark Stephens quotes some
article from VW which claims that that area of the head may
&quot;stress-relieve&quot; within the first few minutes of operation.  I have a
friend with a rebuilt set of heads that arrived from Mark Stephens with
lots of cracks in the exhaust ports.  If the cracks are near the valve
seats, that's a whole different problem and it's serious.

Again, I'm skeptical since I've never had such cracks in the exhaust ports
of any heads I've run.  You'll have to decide if it's a problem for you.
If you're having a mechanic do the work, I guess it's a problem.

&gt;Not
&gt;to mention after paying 2nd day air it arrives a week after I ordered it.

Bus Depot probably had them shipped 2nd day direct from AVP.  If AVP didn't
ship them 2nd day, I would call Bus Depot and ask for a refund for part of
the shipping.

&gt;Has any one else dealt with AVP before.  

Several people on the list have, and I believe the concensus is that AVP is
a fairly reputable shop.

&gt;heads(even if I change out the bad one.)  The ones he uses he says are new
&gt;from Germany and are $500 a piece.  But then that goes back to the original
&gt;problem that Bus depot says about the originals...
&gt;Who is right?

I would lean towards believing AVP and Bus Depot, and I sure as hell
wouldn't pay $500 each for new heads.  Even without the supposed problem
with the seats, they are not THAT much better if the rebuilts were done
properly.
