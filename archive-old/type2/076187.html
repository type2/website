&gt;Evening, all-

&gt;What is the opinion on the list of the Shell Rotella 15W40 dino oil? It
&gt;would be for use in a daily driver 1974 T2, 1.8 ltr, with hydraulic lifters.
&gt;I live and drive in western KY where the winter temps rarely go as low as 0F

I've run 15W40 Rotella exclusively in some of my better vans, often year
round in WV, though I do switch out to 20W50 in the air cooled.  The
Rotella is good stuff, and is the minumum that should about ever be run
by the book in an air cooled VW in the continetal 48.
