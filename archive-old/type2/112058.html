&gt; I have driven a bus with a cylinder head temp (CHT) gauge, an oil
&gt; temperature (OT) gauge and an oil pressure (OP) gauge.  The CHT rises
&gt; quickly with load and falls quickly when the load is removed.  OP follows
&gt; it with significant damping and OT lags OP very significantly.  The lag
&gt; between OP and OT may be a function of sensor placement.  The OP sender is
&gt; located right after the pump and reacts almost instantly to changes in
&gt; pump efficiency whereas the OT sender is located in the sump and has to
&gt; wait until the cooler oil reaches and mixes with the reserve oil in the
&gt; sump.

This is interesting.  Since nasty effects like stud pulling are a function
of CHT, it looks like driving by the oil temperature might yield a
situation where you could have the heads at dangerous temperatures before
the temp rise shows up on the oil temp gauge.  Looks like a CHT gauge is a
pretty important thing to have if you push the limits.
