&gt; Any of you type-4-engine Bus folks know what the threaded hole in the top of
&gt; the fan housing is??? It's about 1 1/2 inches (I think).  It was pouring out
&gt; air until I taped it temporarily 'cause I figured this couldn't be correct.

&gt;           Porsche-style indeed!! you're running a 911/914 engine---look down
&gt; through that hole to line up on TDC...now I'm wondering how you found TDC
&gt; before...

that hole is also in type IV engines that were used in type IV cars too. 

the type IV engine gets it's designation since it was first designed for
the 411/412 VW's The real type IV, last sold in 1974 as an 1800, in the
USA at least they were ALL fuel injected.  so yes there is a stock 1700 FI
type IV engine, I had one I swipped from a 71 411 and converted to a bus
style FI, worked ok as a spare engine when I had my 2L out for work
