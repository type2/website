Subject: Aftermarkey wheels for a Bay

Has anyone found a good source for an aftermarket wheel that fits a '71 and
later Baywindow bus?  I have been looking around and found wheels that are
15X7 with offset of 38 mm and have a center bore of 72.6mm.  Will these fit?
I want to lower the RPMs while cruising on the highway. Thanks.
