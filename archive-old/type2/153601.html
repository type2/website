Subject:	VWs harassment of enthusiasts


Mr Philips:

Please tell your client that I, a life-long owner of VW/Audi products
(including my present V8 Touareg, Audi quattro, and 1978 Westfalia
Campmobile undergoing a $15,000 restoration effort) and I am livid over this
asinine &quot;cease-and-desist&quot; demand on a Volkswagen enthusiast's cafepress_dot_com
store.

This act is petty.  It is vindictive.  It is the behavior of a bully who
picks on little people only because he can.

Volkswagen ought to be ashamed to harass the few owners who are proud of
their VW!  As for me, it will be a cold day in you-know-where before I
purchase another VWAG product.  BMWs work better, cost about the same
net-net, and they actually treat their customers with basic dignity and
respect.

Oh one more thing:  my Touareg has made thirty trips to the dealer service
department in fewer than twenty-four months.  VW should spend half as much
time on quality control as it does preemptive enforcement of dubious claims
on public-domain &quot;IP&quot;.

PS:  I have already begun reporting your abhorrent demands to all my friends
and associates.  So far, they share my outrage.
