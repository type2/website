Subject: curious thermostat stroke
Message-Id: &lt;v01510101b360c95a010f_at_[207.172.43.81]&gt;

I'm rebuilding a 1776 on a test stand.  Usually, I install the thermostat
after the fan housing and all the tinware are in place so I have never
watched the movement of the four vanes as the rod is pushed up and down by
the expanding/contracting bellows.

This time, I was curious. I installed the fan housing, connected the four
van levers with the flat connecting rod, connected the spring,  removed the
generator/fan from the fan housing, and watched the vanes as I moved the
rod up and down by hand.

I wanted to answer the question: If I install the fully contracted bellows
on its bracket with the rod pulled down far enough to close the vanes, will
the stroke of the expanding bellows open the vanes all the way to allow
maximum cooling.

I could not do the experiment. Even though I screwed the bellows fully onto
the rod, when the vanes were closed by hand, the bellows hung so far below
the bracket that there was no chance of the vanes closing all the way.  I
enongated the slot in the bracket as much as I dared withoug weakening it.
Still not enough slot to meet the bellows in the &quot;down&quot; position.

Can anyone suggest an explanation?  Are the vanes meant to be fully closed
when the bellows is fully contracted?

Thanks, Jack
