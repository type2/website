Subject: selenoid replacement

I am going to replace the selenoid for the starter on my bus as well
as replace some of the wiring that may be getting old. Question is this...

My bus isn't near me (It's awaiting me at the farm in a heated garage)
It's a 78 with a 1700 fi engine. I believe it's a bosch unit... I can't 
remember
for certain.

Which selenoid do I purchase here in town before heading out... anyone
know for sure?

J
