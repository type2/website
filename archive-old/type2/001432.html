hey folks:

driving a 76 bus. about once a day when I use the brakes, I get hard =
pressure after about half the travel of the pedal I should have before =
braking normally starts. Not mildly hard or getting harder as I go but =
HARD right away. It'll still stop, but I have to stomp on it. I have the =
brake booster on board, serviced the front brakes recently....

What's up?

Billy
