Been a while, but I think there's a VW repair shop in Brick
Township...A phone book search should turn it up if it's
still around. Luckily, it's a '71, so a good Beetle 1600
could be fitted with an adapter to get home (Sorry,
Dr. Tim...;-(
There's also Pegasus Motors in Elizabeth (without a
recommendation, BTW)
Automotion in Passaic (ask for Aldo...)
