Subject: Re: [T2] where to put spare on 77 westy ?(AnswerNemo)

Hi Volks,

What about a donut spare from some other 5x112-rimmed vehicle like a  
mercedes or passat? One of those would take up a lot less room under  
or inside a bus or even (gasp) up front.

Obviously you would need to be VERY careful not to drive very far or  
very fast on it, but it would be better than being stranded.  
Sometimes a can of &quot;Fix-a-flat&quot; just isn't enough:

Happy Trails,
