Yep, I have experienced them, on more than one occasion.

I can e mail you pics of one that went flat and never made it out of my
driveway! with their matching lifters..

Subject: [T2] Question on Scat Cams/lifters


&gt; Hi gang...
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering if anyone with first hand experience with the
&gt; camshafts/lifters from this supplier in a type IV application, can
&gt; provide some factual data on their experiences...
&gt;
&gt; I took apart a Vanagon low mileage engine recently...it was supposed to
&gt; have been rebuilt recently...new heads, black bearly off the cam
&gt; lobes...new P&amp;C...but the #1 rod had spun a bearing, and tossed it
&gt; everywhere til it was gone..
&gt;
&gt; I had a little trouble figuring out it was a Scat cam, as it had no
&gt; stamped-in markings, but comparing the casting markings against a new
&gt; one, along with the cam gear, figured it to be a 20086...
&gt;
&gt; So here's what else I found...
&gt; Two of the eight new lifters were concave....
&gt;
&gt; All of the lobes were worn providing a lift (subtracting lobe width from
&gt; height) of anywhere from .219 to .259...
&gt;
&gt; I've heard a lot of negative comments about Scat cams over the years,
&gt; but nothing recently concerning premature lobe wear. I'm looking for
&gt; some first hand experiences if anyone has them.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Den.
