&gt; What is the original color of the under color.
&gt; For those of us who want to do a ground up resto knowing only the exterior
&gt; color and interior color does not help when it comes to the under carriage.
&gt; Are they all the same or do they vary according to exterior colors.
&gt; My bus would is mouse grey.
&gt; Any help would be appreciated!
