Subject: Impound hearing update

Well, I had my impound hearing, which was just me, the Department of
Transportation officer who received the call, and an arbitrator. I wore
my Poor Richard &quot;Netvergnügen&quot; t-shirt, and the officer complimented me
on it! :-) The arbitrator read the tow report, read the pertinent penal
code section, the officer gave his side of the story, I gave mine, and I
submitted a detailed statement for further perusal by the arbitrator. I
was pleasant and cheerful and honest the whole time.

I'll be notified by mail of the outcome (wah-waaaaaaah). I gave it
everything I had, so we'll see how it goes. Either way, I did my best.

Nikki
