Subject: Re: [T2]oil coming out of dipstick(update)

Aren't we just talking about rings/cylinders that won't seal? The Corvairs have problems when turboed or run at REALLY high rpms b/c under those conditions they produce more blowby (crankcase pressure) than the stock system can get rid of. Consequently it blows out the dipstick. One solution I have heard the Corvair guys mention would be to cut the bottom (inside the crankcase) of the dipstick tube off. That way the pressure exits without taking oil (or as much oil) with it. That works for them. I don't know if that would be the solution for a VW engine. 

I'd guess your engine has a bad compression ring(s) and the dipstick is the natural exit for the oil (least resistence). I would vent the heads (some of the VW heads came this way - Type III I think?). Some of the Porsche engines did too. 

The Beetle performance guys have to do this too sometimes. Tubes to a oil/air separator on the firewall from the heads. Drain tube into the crankcase. Maybe vent it to the aircleaner. Some prob vent it to the atmosphere. 

Maybe you need to rebuild or just do a topend rebuild (pistons/cylinders/etc). Maybe your valve guides are worn, maybe the cylinders are warped, maybe the compression rings have too much end gap, maybe you have a small hole in a piston. 

You fix the symptom or the cause... The cause fix is going to be more time consuming and expensive obviously. 

I'd read up on the performance Beetle guys. www.shoptalkforums_dot_com is a GREAT start as is all the Beetle performance books. Different engine, same desgin more or less, same limitations. 

Hope this helped just a bit.
