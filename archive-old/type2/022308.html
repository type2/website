Subject: 1980 Vanagon Charging?
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a friend with a 1980 Vanagon. He seems to be having charging 
problems. He found a silver box on the firewall with 5 wires coming out of 
individual ceramic tubes. He says it's the voltage regulator. It definitely 
had problems. One of the wires was severed and 2 were frayed almost to the 
point of breaking.

I don't know much about these later beasts, but this thing sure doesn't 
look like any voltage regulator I've ever seen. My 1971 bus has it sitting 
right on the firewall where it belongs! This thing has a couple of part 
numbers:

022 906079
0 280 159 001

So my questions are:

1. What is this thing?
2. Would this thing cause the battery to not charge up?
3. Where the heck is the voltage regulator?
