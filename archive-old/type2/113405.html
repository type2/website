Subject: Re: [T2] 30PICT on a dual-port manifold

&gt; I'll be switching from a single-port to a dual-port manifold on the 
&gt; rebuilt engine that's going into my '70 at the end of the month.  I 
&gt; can get a new 34PICT carb, which is stock for the dual-port setup, or 
&gt; I can keep my 7-year-old 30PICT and use the adapter, at about a tenth 
&gt; the cost.  Opinions?

I'm running a 30Pict on my 1600DP with a vacuum advance dizzy and am 
quite happy with it.

I've heard that it also works really well with the 009.
