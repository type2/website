Hey Everyone,

I just wanted to thank everybody for all the great responses regarding 
my stalling problem.  

The consensus seems to be either wiring or the voltage regulator, I'll 
have to check both.  Luckily I do have the factory repair manual and 
will get to it when the rain stops here in Bellingham, and tell you what 
if I find.

Thanks again everyone,
