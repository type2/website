I get water in the corners of the back area (including the spare tire well)

after a heavy rain or a high-pressure wash. I'm fairly sure the culprit is
a
worn-out hatch seal. When I open the back hatch after a wash, I can see
where the water has infiltrated the seal at the top corners. So I bought a
new one and plan to stick it in there real soon.

I'm wondering what types of adhesives people have used to replace this seal

... or the sliding door seal, which is similar in design. Any advice will
be
much appreciated.
