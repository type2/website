Victor,

Make darn sure it's not the heads leaking, instead of a hose, or pump.
The 85 is the last year for the 1.9, and a stronger engine than the
later 2.1's.
Cantankerous, expensive to repair. (allot more than the T-2's)
Prone to seam rusting, among other places.
Prior to purchasing it, take it for a spin.
Crawl under it and scope out the leakation.
More comfortable to drive than the T-2's, and better handling, but like
I said one heck of a lot more money for parts, and if you have problems,
more headaches.

You ought to hang out at the Vanagon list for a couple of days and see
what goes on over there.
The price sure seems right------

Good Luck,
