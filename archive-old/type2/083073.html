Subject: re: bentley manuals, ect, ect

you can get bentley shop manuals at your local vw
flaps if you live near one.  i live in so cal so that
is rather easy for me.  if you don't have the luxury
of living in the peoples republic of kalifornia then
your best bet would be either Amazon_dot_com or order one
from So Cal Imports.  If memory serves me it should
run you 35$ or less unless you were to be so lucky as
to get a splitty then it is around 90 for the official
shop manual.  

since i haven't introduced myself to this list yet, i
am an avid vw nut like most of you and i just bought
my first bus, a 72 westy with an 1800 with dual carbs
in it.  i have never worked on a t-4 engine before and
i look forward to it.  in my sig i'll put my heard of
vehicles.  can't wait to get the body work done on the
westy, paid 1000 dollars for it and it is real
straight with no rust save for a few little holes
under the windshield which i have already por-15'd. 
it has the bed, long cot and kids cot in it with all
the closets ect but it is missing the sink.  i found a
guy with a 76 for sale who might be willing to sell me
the sink and stove out of his for 200$ (is that fair?)
 as i'm sanding off the paint i've found this to have
been a true hippy van as it is like one of those jaw
breakers that have different colors wherever you sand.
 all in all it is a great van, can't wait to paint and
cruise in it.  

big question,  i got new window rubber from &quot;bill &amp;
steve's&quot; and while the drivers door seals awsome their
is a gap between the outer scraper and the window on
the drivers.  is their a bow to these windows and
could i have the wrong window on my drivers side?

sincerely,

paul and laurel kagel
