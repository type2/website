Dont have any spare parts lying around right now, but was able to find a 
rebuild kit at my local flaps. I've run a bug spray on two different buses 20 
years apart (same carb)
pretty easy to set up, does require a throttle cable extender. Gives good 
throttle response and of course you have to run an 009 dist. Even gets a good 
review in 'how to hotrod' . Only complaint is due to height, you have to run 
a small air cleaner
