&gt;If I have to pay $60 for it and wait for it to be shipped, I will but I'd rather find it locally for a bit less money.  Anyone know what kind of pump this is, or what type of vehicle originally used it?

Similar to that would be Airtex p/n E8012S -- most anyplace can cross-refernce that number 
and it's a fairly common pump.  I ran a non-brand (Amgauge) version of that for *years* and 
never had a problem.  Still worked when I sold the car .. couldn't say the same for the engine 
that went in at the same time. :-(
