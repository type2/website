Subject: headlights etc.
Message-ID: &lt;69731ff2.24acc278_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

i had removed the headlights in order to repaint the front end of my 70 
westy. now that i seem to have everything reattached the headlights and the 
left front turn signal do not work. the bulb for the turn signal looks fine. 
if something was wrong with a fuse wouldn't something else not work too. all 
the other lights work except the headlights and the left front turn signal. 
what else should i be checking?
skye
