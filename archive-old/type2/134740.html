Subject: Re: [T2] Cabin Heat and 72-74 NOS

haha Good condition means that they aren't rusted out. They were laying in 
the back seat of a bus I received recently and  I just put them in storage, 
but after Ron's post I thought there might be someone out there searching 
for them.

I honestly can't say if the flanges are flush or not as I don't know the 
history of them and they are outside in the cold and I am inside and warm. I 
could possibly take some pics or check the flushness of them if need be 
tommorrow. If nobody needs them it's no big deal. I wan't thinking so much 
of my wallet as helping someone to fix their heat. Thanks Richard for the 
head's up.

Rob

&gt; What does good condition mean? These parts are stainless steel but the 
&gt; flanges are normal steel and are often quite warped from the heat. It 
&gt; makes sealing the exhaust system difficult unless you heat up and flatten 
&gt; the flanges and then grind them flat.
