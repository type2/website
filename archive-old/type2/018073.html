If other VW owners are like me they take loads of photographs (Oh look! another
bay window with 4 wheels...) so they get lots of spare plastic film canisters.
If not, your local processing shop will be glad to let you have dozens for
nothing. Drop the nuts and bolts in these (you can even put a spot of cleaner in
the canister too!) and lable the canister with a permanent (OHP-type) marker
pen, or with tape. For bigger items you need to eat lots of cottage cheese...
