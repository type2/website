&gt; When did the 1600's stop in the Beetles?  Or did they...

&gt; My 71 Campmobile has no exhaust at present, but looking around in a local
&gt; junkyard, I found a &lt;73&gt;Beetle with intact exhaust and perfect, rust free
&gt; exchangers. I know the exhaust is different, the question is, are the
&gt; exchangers? Can I use 'em on my bus? TIA

The heater flap connections are not the same.  The bus hooks up from the top
and the beetle from below. You could use them if your not concerned with
hooking up the heater cables.
