Darrin I had to take my alternator out of my 74 westy for testing, and for
some reason you have to remove the dipstick to get the alt out. But upon
removal I some how managed to pull the bellows out. Mine was no longer
rubber it was hardened plastic and snapped in pieces. Yes oil went
everywhere so it is possible to have that much of an oil leak. I ordered my
new one from Bus Depot,and have had no new oil leakage since then.
