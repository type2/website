Subject: DA6 question

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

I am having a hell of a time getting my DA6 heater to ignite.  I installed
it on my 81 Vanagon westy, and had Robert Keezer bench test it first, and it
worked for him.  Since then, I have installed, and only get it to light a
few times.

I think the wiring to the hot source may be wrong.  If anyone has one of
these installed, I need to know where the wires in the fuse box attach
(which fuse)  Currently, when I put my key in the ignition, the light on the
control knob comes on.  Also, within a few seconds when I turn the control
knob to the right, the aux fan and combustion blower come on.  Sometimes,
after another minute or so, the fuel pump starts clicking.  I have
discovered theat if I jump the green wire on the fuse relay panel to the
other red wired fuse, the fuel pump always clicks.

I have verified spark.  The glow plug seems to work.  Fuel is being pumped,
I have verified.  Somehow, the sequence of events that makes it ignite is
not occurring.  I have overkilled the grounds from the heat exchanger, so I
do not think it is a ground issue.

Any help is appreciated.  And also, I know a DA6 was designed for diesel,
but I have been assured that it will run on anything., and I have had it
running, all but briefly.

TIA
