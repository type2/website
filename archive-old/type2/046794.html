&gt;&gt;Question:  Is it possible for a dizzy to be put in incorrectly? As in the
&gt;&gt;mark that should point to cylnder 1 being TDC is actually pointing to
&gt;&gt;cylnder 3 being TDC?
&gt;
&gt;No and Yes. No, the dizzy can only go into engine (engage the distributor
drive
&gt;gear)
&gt;one way. But Yes, 

Very excellant, efficient, complete explanation of the problem, Chris. 


Will add:

Do it stock. Verify it once. Results insured. If not stock, verify
everything twice, then continue to verify results.
