Subject: [T2] FI lovers question


&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; 78 Champagne edition...  2.0l with fi
&gt;
&gt; You convinced me that fi was good(don't go carbs).
&gt;
&gt; I learned it...no problem.  It works well, I can reach in and turn the key
&gt; and it fires right up.
&gt;
&gt; Now it's time to start replacing some parts, mostly I figure I have a
&gt; slight vacum leak in the large rubber tube that goes from the afm to the
&gt; plenum.
&gt;
&gt; I just tried to order one(from bus-boys) and was told that it is(dreaded
&gt; words) NLA.
&gt;
&gt; What now?  Do I grovel at the Mack truck shop looking for the large sizes
&gt; of preformed intake and radiator hose tubes and roll my own, or does
&gt; anyone have a good source for &quot;new&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Looking for tubing, dave&lt;grin&gt;
