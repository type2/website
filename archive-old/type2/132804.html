Subject: Free '72 parts bus in Oakland, CA

The ad below was on the SF Craigslist.

I checked it out at 10:30am 6/21.  Lot's of good stuff for the
pickins...glass, doors, body panels, westy side windows etc are look ok.

It's a non-poptop westy with full 72 westy interior.  Not too bad shape, the
seats etc look pretty good.  The engine is partially gone, but the bus has 4
wheels and is unlocked.

Bring a flatbed tow-truck and haul it away.  Or bring your tools and pick
and pull it apart.

(The VIN plates have been removed so I assume the owner just wants it to
disappear...and juding by the other cars on the block this street appears to
be a sort of a &quot;Death Row for vehicles&quot;).




'72 VW Westfalia van w/'75 fi 1800 free parts !! (oakland east)
