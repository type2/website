Subject: Re: [T2] master cylinder install success(kinda)

The machine shops around here dont like ya unless you drive a chevy.I broke
a head stud on my bug and needed it drilled out and replaced.The best time
frame I got from the three machine shops around here was&quot;we might be able to
get to it next week&quot; so I loaded it up and drove thirty miles to the nearest
vw guy and he drilled it out and replaced it in about five minutes.Plus this
was stripped pretty bad.A LOT of metal came out when I loosened
it.Considering I have to get off work early to get up to the vw guy(and its
pretty hard to get off work early)it was just easier to just get a rebuilt
one.Im gonna do the other side next week.My next order I place with one of
the vw places Ill get some new brake hoses too.Im not sure how long all that
stuff has been on there anyway.Bottom Line... my bus stops very well now so
Im happy.Later
