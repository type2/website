Subject: tire size for 77 bus

Hey volks, I tried to search archives, but to no avail. I
would like to know if anyone has tried to run &quot;aggressive&quot;
off-road tires on their bus. Local tire shop can get BFG's
KO, I forget the tire size to be exact, but I believe it was
something like 27x8.50? I could be wrong, I dunno. Where I
live (bfe) is nothing but hard, sharp rocky roads and long
ones at that and need tough tires. I really like the BFG KO
series look to me with the tri plywall and tough tread,
durable to go off road wherever you want, but safe on the
road. Anyone have any experience with this tire or size
range? Thanks! -Mark B.
