Well,

It's been a long time since I've posted anything to the list.  I thought it
was gone?  Good to see it back.  If anybody remembers, sometime last year I
started building a 2 liter for my 72 Westy with dual baby Webers.  Well the
time has come to install that puppy and I have to make room in my garage, so
I wont have room to store my 1800 engine.  Its a great running engine that
sees daily use since I drive my Westy EVERYDAY.  Anyway, It has dual
Dellorto carbs and runs really smooth.  The rings, gaskets and valve job
have about 10K miles on them.  The buyer can drive it before I yank it.  If
anybody is interested please pmail me.  Thanks.
