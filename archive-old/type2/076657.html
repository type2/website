Subject: Re: [T2] Intake runner sleeves/boots

Sean,

I have 78 so I assume that they may be similar...I had the same problem on
the 1/2 side of mine, but not the 3/4 side.

Lots of lube and the patience of Job.  Hold your mouth just right helps
too.  I just worked with it until I got it.  I think I ended up *just*
fitting them over the manifold end and then getting them started as I got
the manifold on the bolts at the same time.

It's just one of those things....

Cheers ,dave

&gt; Hi everyone and Happy Turkey day to all.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 1980 Westy I am rebuilding and have hit a stumbling block on the
&gt; 2.0l re-assembly.
&gt; I cannot get the intake runner (rubber) sleeves back on the air distributor
&gt; and runners. When I remove the air distributor and put the sleeves on the
&gt; runners, I cannot then slide them back onto the air distributor to connect
&gt; them.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help/advice would be appreciated
