Subject: Not White Hubcaps - grey

I was wrong...the original hubcaps on my '70 ASI/Riviera pop top camper were 
not white, as I thought.  They - according to closer inspection of original 
brochures - were a light grey color.  Anyone seen these around, either on 
someone's camper or else sold somewhere?
