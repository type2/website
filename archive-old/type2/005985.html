&gt;Hello All --
&gt;Well, my 79 had her compression checked today and I have mixed emotions
&gt;about the results.  She's been running like a champ and quite smoothly,
&gt;ndicates no significant oil usage, and I haven't been sensing any power
&gt;loss.  The readings were as follows:
&gt;
&gt;#1: 110
&gt;#2: 100
&gt;#3: 115
&gt;#4: 130


Travis,

Lots of variables go into a compression reading:
- Were all the plugs out?
- Was the throttle held open?
- Was the engine warm?
- How long was the engine not-running before the reading was taken?
- Was the gauge fully screwed into the plug hole, or was it held in firm 
enough (depending on type of gauge)?
- Was the gauge read correctly?
- When comparing readings with previous ones, was the same gauge used?

I have 2 gauges and they read more than 10 psi apart. I also get ~ 10 psi 
variation from 2 consecutive readings on the same cylinder (probably for 
one or more of the reasons above).

I wouldn't worry about your readings. You don't have mechanical lifters (I 
assume) so there is nothing you can adjust.

Overheating is the biggest problems with these air cooled jobs, so make 
sure all your tin and engine seals are in place and make sure your timing 
is *correct*. I think your 79 has a single vacuum  dizzy, so it should be 
timed at 7 btdc.

Also, gummed rings can be a big problem in hot running engines - especially 
if 10W40 oil is used and/or oil is not changed regularly. My 77 had 
compression of ~90 in one of the cylinders 3 years ago. The PO believed his 
owners manual when it said change the oil every 7 k miles. He also ran 
20w50 or 10w40. Some of these wide range multi weights have gumming 
problems. I run 10w30 or straight 30w (depending of season). I also change 
the oil/filter *every* 2k miles. The cylinder that had 90 psi, now has 120 
psi. Maybe the regular oil changes are un-gumming the rings.

Get your compression checked (or better yet, check it your self) again in a 
couple of months. In my opinion, you have nothing to worry about.
