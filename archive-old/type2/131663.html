Subject: RE: [T2] Metal Fuel Hose

Hold on now. What metal line did I forget or never see? Is it only on the 
driver's side? The other being the pressure regulator. I assume it is 7mm, 
but is it just a straight piece of pipe?

&gt;From: &quot;alalumia&quot; FIX THAT RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;Use brake line if you have to.
&gt;Or I am sure someone has spare metal line to send you.
&gt;Then wrap some fuel hose (slit) around it to shield the metal through
&gt;the tin hole.
&gt;You are risking a bus fire in the most usual way!


&gt;I noticed my engine does not have a metal tube that passes through the
&gt;front engine tin.  The fuel line just passes through the tin.
