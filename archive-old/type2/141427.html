Subject: Re: [T2] VW is to Mercedes, as hard is to find..

&gt; Ok.. real quick.
Which Mercedes year and sedan model have the same wheel size and bolt patern as the 78 bus?
I'm trying to order the Kleen Wheel brake dust guard
(http://www.brakedustcover_dot_com/)..  im sick of the dirty wheels every darn day.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

All except the G-wagen are 5 x 112mm.

But, only the 140, 215, 220, and ML class have 14mm wheel bolts. All the others are 12mm.

As a MB tech of 27+ years, we do not recommend OR sell them at our dealership. Even though some brands have
slots in them, ALL of them cause overheated brakes because of zero cooling air flow.
Find a better set of brake pads.
