Subject: Re: [T2] Very Green

&gt; There is a test plug on the left(drivers side) of the transmission. It is
a
&gt; 17mm allen fitting. I had to go to a tool shop to find an allen that size.

I, being cheap/poor, and finding that my local FLAPS wanted like $20 for
this allen bit, just bought a bolt with a 17mm head and grabbed it with
Vice-Grips.  $.93 later, I had my tranny tool.  Enjoy!
