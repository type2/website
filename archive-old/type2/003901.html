&gt; I ordered the H4 knock-off headlights that Ron at BusDepot mentioned a
&gt; few weeks back and just got them installed -- WOW what a difference!
&gt;
&gt; I re-wired the headlight circuit to take power straight from the
&gt; battery. I ran two 10 guage wires, one each for the high and low beam. I
&gt; also ran a 10 guage wire back to the battery ground....
&gt; This follows the recomendations found at the following link:
&gt; http://lighting.mbz_dot_org/tech/how_to/relays/


Before I get deluged with concerned inquiries from others who have the
headlight kit, no it is not neccessary to do this rewiring; you may simply
replace your stock bulbs with these H4 kits and use your existing wiring.
They do not draw enough additional current to *require* rewiring if all of
your wiring is up to snuff.  However, I would most certainly *recommend*
that you follow procedure that Scott used if you want to get the most out of
the upgrade.  To recap, these headlight kits run $34.95 for the pair,
complete with bulbs, housings, etc.  They are drop-in replacements for all
busses and Vanagons thru '85 (including 6v models, but then you'd have to
buy 6v bulbs since 12v ones are included).
