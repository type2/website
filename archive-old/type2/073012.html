Subject: fraying clutch cable

I'm seeking some advise on what you think I should do. I need to get a new
clutch cable soon, and the robert at biesman's (mechanic) owes me a new one
because supposivly he just put a new cable on there for me the other day.
Well today about half of the strands broke off of the fitting on the peddle
end. So I just put a spacer in btween the clutch arm and the nut by the
engine and tightened it back up again. The only reason I had to do that is
because I need somthing that will hold so I can drive it in the the shop
about 15 miles away. The thing is that I'm afraid that It Is gonna snap
while Im driving there (Like at a light or somthing. I would have it towed
but I can't afford it right now.. what do you recomend I do if it snaps or
looses enough tension to engage the clutch?

I have to do it tomarow morning befor the trafic starts building (to
minamise shifting) so quick responses would be appreciated!

By the way it's on a 64' transporter.  :-)

thanks for any reply's, I really appreciate it!
