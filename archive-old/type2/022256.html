As for heat, it may make a difference. Last winter while driving my 
friend's '78 Riviera in the cold of winter (Tennessee style, 30's) my wife 
complained it was too hot in the van and would I turn down the heat???!!!

How many times have to heard that??? (This is the friend's van with the 
second layer of metal on the U-pipes still intact). If you ever get the 
chance, drive a 70K mile bus that has been well taken care of. It quickly 
puts you own bus's real condition in perspective!!!

Our bus however makes ice all winter long. Our's was a bit draftier (okay 
alot).

We just replaced ALL of the the weatherstriping and rubber on our '78 Westy 
so I'm anxious to see what effect it has on our bus. Also switched to 
'72-'74 style heaters and I have to finish making all of the parts mate (I 
had to replace the OEM exhaust, it finally rotted off) and the desired 
replacement system (ala RMMW) required a '72-'74 heater system (which I 
think would be superior since less plumbing hanging out in the wind).

As for the wrap you mentioned. This will accomplish the exact same effect 
as the second layer of metal now missing to rot -- HOWEVER -- and you may 
not care (I wouldn't hesitate to see for myself) -- the wrap will hold 
moisture against the steel and will overheat the metal, and accelerate the 
rusting process of the steel. I'm told wrapped pipes may have to be 
replaced annually or semi-annually. The good side is you'll make more power 
(another hamster is worth something right?) - the reason the racers use it!

Another option would be to have a pipe, slightly larger in diameter than 
the OEM U - pipe, bent in the same U. Then split the new pipe and have the 
halves spot welded over your U-pipes. Or just buy the OEM replacement pipes 
- what do these cost?

&gt;Christopher and Chris,
&gt;Thanks for the information and response, respectively. I was close, but 
&gt;didn't appreciate that a hotter pipe would also lower the HC. I haven't 
&gt;had a problem with passing Cal smog tests in the past 22 years, but it is 
&gt;getting kind of close; on the last biennial I was about 50 ppm below the 
&gt;limit. I'm thinking of buying some of that hot rodder exhaust wrapping 
&gt;tape, which should have the same effect as the extra wall. It comes in 
&gt;fairly long rolls for $15-20; maybe it is enough to do 4 or 6 pipes, in 
&gt;which case we could share a roll. Anyone see anything wrong with that as a 
&gt;'fix'? If it also increases the burning of HC it should make for more heat 
&gt;dissipating in the heat exchangers and better winters in the van for the 
&gt;passengers, though I'm uncertain whether it would be noticeable.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
