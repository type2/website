Subject: Re: [T2] Add-on taillight assemblies?

&gt; From: &quot;Eric W. Bradway&quot; &lt;eric_at_bradway_dot_net&gt;
&gt;&gt; ... I'm not interested in original look...
&gt;
&gt; These would be shipped so that they could be easily painted to
&gt; match/complement the customer's' bus' colors.  I could cast-prime them, but
&gt; the primer color/type might not be what a particular customer prefers.

I was just looking at prices on the LED lights. They aren't too much more
expensive than new German OEM taillight assemblies for the Bay. I also need
side markers (both sides were taken off by people parking too close at the
University parking lots).

If I could get a prefab mounting plate for the taillights, it would easily be
work $30 per taillight to me. I know the lights would be extra beyond that.
I'd end up spending about $75/taillight but the result would be fantastic
IMHO...

-Eric
