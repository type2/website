Subject: type2 sightings - movie

i rented The Pirates of Silicon Valley the other night and 
was amazed at how many vw type2's were in the movie.

a mid 70's westy, a nice blue and white double cab 
[don't know what year, but it's got thos little round taillights],
a Thing, and at least one bug.

... the movie it'self
is rather interesting too.
