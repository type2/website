&gt;&quot;Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
&gt;Won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast,
&gt;I love you all, but Jesus loves you the best
&gt;And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight...&quot;
&gt;&lt;traditional folk song, something like that...&gt;

     Eloquent. And the music, which has to me always been a comfort, 
rings in my ears. If possible I will attempt to post an MP3 of this 
tomorrow. 

     I never really knew Josh, other than from his posts. Nonetheless, in 
the words of John Donne (from 
http://www.rjgeib_dot_com/thoughts/donne/donne.html):

&gt;       No man is an Iland, intire of itselfe; every man is a peece of the
&gt;       Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the
&gt;       Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well
&gt;       as if a Manor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death
&gt;       diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore
&gt;       never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

     The bell tolls for us all.


Peace,
