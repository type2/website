Subject: Re: Exploding Oil Filters

&lt;Paul Wies asked what the symptoms of an exploded oil filter were.
Though two out of three of my experiences were non-VW, I figure the rest
of you may want to know just how many experiences it takes me to learn my
lesson :-)

Note that bursting an oil filter is more serious than it appears at first.
Though replacing the filter and changeing the oil may seem to be the end
of it, remember that the filter element bits are left in the engine.
Circulating.  To those little tiny oil passages.  OOPS.  Though a bit of
tissue is nowhere near hard enough to ruin a bearing on its own, blocked
oil passages very well may.&gt;

Paul,

Well, it depends.

On the '47 Dodge, there are all sorts of clues.  The pop, the sound of oil
squirting against the front hood, the pressure drop, etc.  That car,
however had a wierd filter arrangement.  It was not your typical screw-on
canister but a container that held (are you sitting down?) a roll of
toilet paper.

On the '64 Ford station wagon, the clue was the oil on the driveway.  It
was deep winter and I started the car to preheat it, got out to go back in
to the house, and noticed the oil pouring out.

On the '78 VW bus, the only clue was the oil light.  Well, the next door
neighbor running down the street might count, but since I didn't notice,
'til after the light came on, it probably shouldn't :-)  Fortunately, from
my place to the VW dealer is 4 blocks and all downhill.  One of the
plusses of living where I do.

In each case, the only linking factor was that it was terribly cold and I
was running oil that was too heavy for the climate.  In all three cases, I
was attempting to compensate for oil leaks by running heavier oil.  I
wasn't born brilliant, and I am not sure that I have grown better over the
years, but I do know now that heavy oil will not compensate for an oil
leak, and may cause more serious problems.
