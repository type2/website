Subject: ACS&amp;R Shirts!

A batch of Richard Palmer's soon-to-be-famous Air-Cooled Search &amp; Rescue 
Team shirts arrived on my door step this afternoon (I ordered a couple 
hundred dollars worth to guarantee early mailing).  They are *so* cool!  
The design and execution are truly first rate.  Way to go Richard!

I will have a few of these available for purchase at this weekend's 
Mo-Kan VW Club swap meet in N. Kansas City (in XL and XXL sizes).     
Find me early (these won't last long) ...  :-)
