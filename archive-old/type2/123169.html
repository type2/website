&gt; &gt;Found everything I needed but also found some nice little brass ball
&gt; &gt;valves for less than $10.
&gt; 
&gt; The brass shouldn't care, but I wonder about the compatibility of the
&gt; seals in the valve with gasoline.

I use em in my fuel line and they have no valves at all they are precision
machined to not have gaskets
