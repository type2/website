Subject: Re: [T2] Child's cot

so I made a little joke yesterday about a certain &quot;Camper Manuel&quot;, which
listmember DMBJOC_at_aol_dot_com had accidentally written on a post. Well I just
sent it to him, then I thought it was kinda funny so I posted to the list.
No ill will was meant. ITS A JOKE!

Well, he got a little grouchy about that and had these fine words to say to
me. I guess some of us are more sensitive than others about our grammar
shortcomings. Bus content? Don't respond to this bunghole's BUS questions.

rode in on.
