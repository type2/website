Subject: Re: Be honest... How fast?

Well, I like to drive flats at around 80 and do uphills
around 65.  Too bad that's not what I get.  I usually do
around 70 or 75(with a good wind) on flats and anywhere
from 55 to 35 on hills on my 75 Westy depending on how long
it's been since I replaced the fuel filter and the hill of
course...  I just put new heads on it around 5K miles back
('96 (been out of the country a bit..)).  How knows when
