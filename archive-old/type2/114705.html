I had a great time at bug out. So what if there are alot of h2o guys there,
they need a place to go to. There was plenty of air cooled rides there to
make me happy I will be there this year with the wife and kids again and
plan on haveing a great time. See who ever goes there.

If you are going to the Manassas bug out figuring it to be a great
air-cooled show, don't bother.  i went up last year, in the spring, for I
had heard what a great air-cooled show it was................HARDLY!  I saw
a couple nice busses, and a few sweet single cabs, but no ovals, split
window bugs or anything.  It has turned mainly into an event for the water
cooled jettas, new beetles, etc., with the big stereos that they crank up to
their rap music.

I was really disappointed, and emailed the people that ran the show.  They
told me tha tover the years the event has changed..........fewer and fewer
of the old cars come to it anymore.

The drag racing is fun, and the swap meet is better than
most.............Mark Dearing from Salem Imports  always has cool
stuff............

The Florida Bug Jam blows it away, by far for vintage vehicles.
