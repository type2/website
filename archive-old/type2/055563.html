Subject: buses and parts FS Oregon

We are thinning the herd at my shop.

We have:
63 doublecab
 1500 runs, but has major oil leaks, probably rear main, and p/r tubes. 
All corners dinged, rust all over, perfs in gates, floors, and rockers.
Not a pretty bus, but project for someone who is good at bodywork.
$900 takes it, less if you are a good talker.

67 hardtop deluxe, relatively straight body, no engine, no interior,
transmission screams. $350 and you haul it away.

79 westy camper, parting out.  Drivers side has seen the pavement. Top
decent but not perfect. Engine and trans shot. Have front seats in
original green plaid in mediocre shape, bed is gone, sink cabinet gone.
Closet and roof cabinets still there and many parts. Not shipping
anything bigger than a breadbox. Parts are cheaper when you pull them
yourself.

Several other splitties in different shape, some runners, some not.

84 Vanagon 7 passenger, brown, 100k, just did head gaskets, clean and
straight, $3000.

I dont have pictures and we will not deliver or arrange for vehicles to
be transported. 

If you are interested, Call Independent Bug Werks at 541-752-4884 
between 7:30am and 5pm  Pacific, mon-fri and ask for Jack. Or come see
them at 605 SW 13th, Corvallis, OR 97333.
