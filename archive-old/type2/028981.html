I'll add my two cents. I have a degree in engineering while obtaining this
degree I have studied heat transfer. As most know there are three forms of
heat transfer. Radiant, conductive, and convective. All three of these are
carefully considered when building an engine especially convective when
dealing with an air cooled engine. In fact, in a finite element course we
studied a problem of a cooling fin, if I remember correctly we looked at it
twice once without and once with a convection term on the boundary. Of
course there was a significant difference in total heat transfer when the
convection term was added. This leading to the point of this email. VW calls
the lower tin a &quot;heat channel&quot;. I believe that this is do to the fact that
the heat produced by these engines is channeled and kept contained within
defined parameters (i.e. within the tin). While the cylinder heads are
designed in such a way to rapidly dissipate heat it is not to say that the
engine core need be cooled as fast in fact. I would almost say that the
&quot;cooling tin&quot; is not &quot;cooling&quot; at all. It is assuring that the engine is
properly heated. By controlling the ambient air temperature within the
engine core (via the heat channels and cover plates) the convection effect
on the engine is controlled. The thermostat is within the controlled ambient
air. When this ambient air is warm enough then the thermostat expands and
opens the channels for the cooling fan air outside air. Now cooler outside
air is actually keeping the engine at that thermostat temp. 85 degrees
centigrade. Take all this with a grain of salt. FYI we have lots of great
heat channels and cover plates if anyone needs any. Hee hee!

&gt; If your engine is warming up fast it emit less unburned fuel and several
&gt; other bad gasses. Let us try to stop the greenhouse effect the best we
can.
&gt; Keep those thermostats where they are supposed to be.
