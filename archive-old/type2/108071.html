Subject: RE: [T2] Crap now enigne wont turn!

I assume you're using a big wrench to turn the big nut on the alternator?
This should turn the engine, but it ain't easy at the top of a compression
stroke. If you're sure the engine is stuck:

1) Make sure it's in neutral
2) Is the starter still in it?  If so maybe the starter solenoid is stuck in
the flywheel? Remove the starter and try again.


Good Luck
