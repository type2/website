Check with your local glass suppliers. Locally I hear you can get a new 
windshield installed for $150.

I suggest you supply your own new gasket (West Coast Metric makes the best 
IMHO) and make sure that if they break it during install they have to 
supply a replacement at no cost to you.

My wife and I installed our windshield (reinstalled it) after our paint 
job. Very careful we were using alot of silicone spray.

Not hard just scary.
