Subject: vw emblem

Hi Volks,
I have a quick question.  When I bought my bus, the emblem was missing.  I 
have recently purchased a replacement emblem and my problem is that it is 
attached from behind, meaning it is attached by nuts from the inside of the 
bus.  My question is how do I do this?  I own a 70 by the way and I don't 
quite see a way to get past the air system.  Is this possible or do I need 
another emblem?

Thanks,
Rick Meier
