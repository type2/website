&gt; And I am betting 1 good virtual 6 pack of german beer that Mike has a 
&gt; normal &quot;un-sealed&quot; lead acid battery in his bus.  In which case, his new 
&gt; expensive battery cables will benefit from the 99 cent corrosion 
&gt; inhibitors.

hello Dave yes the odds are in that direction but you never know if they dont 
tell you and murphy is still out there     and those felt rings do work OK    
  I dont think the posts being made of lead have anything to do with the 
corrosion build up   Later and have fun  Mark dearing
