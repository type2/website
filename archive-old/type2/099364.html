&lt;&lt; I've used Yellow Freight to ship an engine accross the country, strapped
on  a pallet and wrapped in plastic and then covered with a cardboard
homemade cover.  have done it twice both times arrived undamaged (this is
a T-4 engine) cost about $100
 &gt;&gt;

Ditto. Check out the large trucking outfits in your area. Cheapest is terminal
to terminal. Box it securely and deliver it to the closest terminal to you 
and 
ship it to the closest terminal at the other end.
