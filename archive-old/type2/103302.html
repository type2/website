Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Berg Temp Dipstick

Re the Berg temp dipstick going off too readily- I've had the same thing
happen, and it wasn't because it was too hot. You have to line it up right
or the little temp spring rolls around and grounds out on the road draft
tube. You have to look back there if the light comes on, I panicked one day
thinking I had no oil pressure. All I had to do is turn the dipstick a bit.
The engine was at the correct temp.

&lt;The dipstick sender from Gene Berg is easier to install, but it is not
really a gauge.  Rather, it is a temperature switch that you hook up to the
existing oil pressure light or a new light that you install.  I tried this,
and what I found is that it kept turning the light on under even moderate
driving conditions (71 westy with stock 1600 DP).  I checked and found it's
calibration to be accurate as best I could tell, but having the thing going
off all the time was annoying and caused me to ignore it.&gt;
