Subject: Re: The Wonderful Smell of Gas

Casey --
I've dealt with this one on both my 79 and my girlfriend's 77.  (In my 79's
case, I unknowingly saw the left rear leaking gas while parked in La Paz,
Mexico after a fill-up just before heading farther south - and just about
sh*t bricks.)  In both cases, it was the small 3-4&quot;-length of braided fuel
line that connects the ends of the two metal (?) venting lines up within
the rear left side.  If you reach behind and above (and a little towards
the front of the bus from) where a battery would sit if you had one on the
left side -- or better yet, if you stick your head partway in and shine a
little flashlight back up in there if the fumes aren't too overwhelming --
you'll find the little piece of hose connecting the two non-flexible vent
lines.  Actually, it may only be connecting one of them -- in which case
that is where your leak is coming from.  In both of my cases, the line had
rotted and just split away from one of the vent lines, giving the fuel an
easy route to the pavement via the rusted remains of the left side battery
tray.  You may have to peel the old hose like a banana to get it off, and
it may be a bear to get the new piece of hose to fit into the narrow space
between the two vent lines -- but persevere and you shall succeed.  Have
fun...
