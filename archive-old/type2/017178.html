Clark and the rest in the list:

Before a had my 73, I had for 12 years a Brazilian CHEVETTE.  Few years back, I
desided to change the original fuel pump for an electrical one and hot wired it
directly from the switch (using a relay ofcurse).  I knew the this could be a
time bomb if a very heavy accident should accur, but by the rest it never
failed.

I know that the Ford SIERRA known in Europe as the Ford Merkur, has this system
as well as other important European cars, and they use a relay type the works
only when the alternator is giving more that 13 volt, so if you stop your engine
but with the switch on, still the pump wont work.  Probably you can check on
this.... Just guessing !!.

I have  (seme where) a SIERRA manual (the type made and sold in Venezuela) and
will check if I can get to the pump diagram.  If so, I'll try to get it to you.
