&gt; &gt; Q2.  How does the fuel gauge work?  My gauge reads ok when the tanks full
&gt; &gt; (it shows it as being over 3/4) but when the tank gets down to around half
&gt; &gt; or less, the gauge jumps around, pegging both ends, frantically.  It doesn't
&gt; &gt; seem to do it as bad when the car is on but not running.  Thoughts?

&gt;The problem is intermittent connections in the sender.
&gt;Inside the sender are 2 stretched conductive wires and a contact on a
&gt;float the wires can get contaminated spots that dont conduct well and you
&gt;get a jerky fuel gauge.
&gt;The best fix is to replace the sender.
&gt;You can fool with the senders innards but its a real hassle to put it back
&gt;only to find that it still doesnt work so well.

I had a fuel gauge that worked like this, and I thought I needed replace the 
sender. I knew that the sender was alright when I put it in, although it had 
been sitting for a few years before I started using the car. I thought it had 
gone bad. I was surprised to find that it worked just fine after I installed new 
gauges. If you have a spare fuel gauge, or a friend who has one, you could 
try and hook it up to your car and see if it will solve the problem, just to 
make sure it is the sender. The fact that your gauge is 'jerkier' when the 
engine is running could point to a faulty voltage stabilizer, the square thingie 
behind the fuel gauge.
