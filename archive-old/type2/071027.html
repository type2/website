Subject: Depressed..have to sell my cherry 71 crew cab in FL
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Well gang, it's me again, the phantom poster. I have come to a decision that 
I already know I am going to regret. Due to my financial situation I have 
decided to sell my 1971 Crew Cab. 
The truck is super solid. It has absolutely ZERO frame rust and only a few 
tiny  holes of rust in the front floors. The rear cargo floor is perfect.
The cab is about 97% rust free. There is some rust under the passenger's side 
of the front bumper (cut out) at the bottom of the nose, a couple of spots on 
the roof and some tiny holes where the door panels touch the sides of the 
front floor (near steps). Check out the pics of the rockers. All rust has 
been cut out. From what I can see there is no bondo in the body covering old 
rust areas. I looked inside by removing the fuel take covers and it looked 
untouched. The bed is super straight with only one small dent. The problem is 
that the previous owner cut out a couple of panels (to repair rust) and never 
welded back anything. The first area is where the bed seam is (near the cab) 
and the strip is cut from one side to another right above the storage box. 
The other hole is over the engine compartment. This was cut for engine 
access. one Battery tray is rusty but rear corners are perfect. Bed gates are 
in good condition. No holes on the gate sides but some bondo is visible on 
the bottoms (??). The rear tail gate has a good size rust hole on one corner 
but is in repairable shape.  If you look at the photos you will see details 
that are important. Here's the bad: Cut rear fenders, glass sunroof 
installed, and engine compartment has been trimmed out.  The truck had a 
corvair drivetrain when I bought it. I drove it for a while and then pulled 
the drivetrain and sold it (wanting to convert back to VW). I have done a lot 
of work to bring the truck back to a stable vehicle. It was a driver up until 
about 10 months ago. I replaced the master cylinder, all brake hoses, one 
caliper, rear wheel cyls and shoes, re-installed the original instruments and 
repaired the dash wiring to factory specs. The interior is old but in good 
shape. It features a custom built center console and dual 914 Porsche front 
seats. I have original front seat frames that are included. The dash has a 
new glove box and has been drilled for three gauges. There is also a tach 
located in the clock position. The 16 inch wheels are custom modified to fit 
and came off of a 1998 Mercedes Benz. They are truly unique!
This truck is super solid and an excellent candidate for a driver or show 
vehicle. I have looked for over ten years to find a truck this nice here in 
FLorida. THis is why I really do not want to sell her. My problem is 
financial. I cannot afford to fix her and I need a daily driver right now. I 
am asking $4000 for the truck. Those who have had extreme welding done know 
how much body work will set you back. This is SOLID!!!!! I amy even accept a 
partial (NOTE, PARTIAL) VW trade for a unique daily driver and some cash. 
LIke I said, my motivation is money here. It kills me to sell my baby. If 
nothing comes of this soon I may end up finding alternate sources. Speaking 
of which, does anyone want to buy a 1998 Beetle for only $13,500? Find me a 
buyer ASAP and I can save my truck!!!!
Here's the url for the pictures. If you are serious you best move fast.
