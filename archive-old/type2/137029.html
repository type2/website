Subject: Re: [T2] MSquirt in an upright?

Well, instead of doing 4 injectors, you can also do throttle body 
injection instead which only uses 1 injector with higher fuel flow.

I would check out http://www.msefi_dot_com for more details.

later,
Mike

&gt; just idle curiosity at the moment... but is there any looming hurdle to 
&gt; converting an upright (1679cc T1) to MegaSquirt? i mean, i am aware i 
&gt; need to collect all the relevant fi bits, but will it be possible to put 
&gt; it on a bus that originally had a NON-fi motor?
&gt; i'm mainly guessing there might be some electrical components or wiring 
&gt; that need to be spliced in :)
