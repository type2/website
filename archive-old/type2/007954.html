Hey, This is my first post. I was wondering
if anyone could give me any information on
some good VW mechanics in the Atlanta Area.
I have the name of one guy but would like a
few others to compare. Any info would be appreciated. I really want to find someone who
specialized in Bus repair. Feel free to email
me.

Thanks,

Greg
