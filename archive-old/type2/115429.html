Subject: Re: [T2] Points?

10 or 12 sets of points later, and you could have had yourself a new 
electronic ignition.  I'm a purist about some things, but setting dwell and 
gapping an archaic spring mechanism goes a bit beyond my need to keep it 
original.  Anybody care to expand on why you would want to keep your 
points(beyond the need out of necessity)?
