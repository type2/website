Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question

Terry is absolutely right on this one.  The dent guy that I have used 
lately on a new car was *terrific*.

One dent that I thought ruined the car forever was absolutely invisible 
when he was done.

Look in the phone book for *paintless* dent repair.

I can't recomend these guys enough.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Prices differ locally, and as per how many dents where.

 And as I'm not there and don't have one iota of a clue of what the
 damage is by a internet description--don't ask me ---pick up the
 Alexader Graham Bell, and make a couple of phone calls.
&gt; 
&gt; The local dent guy will be more than happy to give you an on the spot
&gt; estimate.
