Subject: Re: [T2] Intake Gaskets, fuel injection

This will sound sacrilege to some, but I've probably built far more T4 engines over the years than most of those who will consider it so.  I've reused the phenolic blocks/gaskets in a pinch (and occasionally when not in a pinch cause I was just in a cheap mood, building a gasket set out of remaims of old gasket sets) using a nice even layer of good old not hardening black permatex on them.  Actually I use the permatex even if I replace the gasket and it has the thin paper (usually pink, sometimes beige, sometimes gray)gaskets on them, if they are the better ones with grafoil (grey, slightly shiny) I don't permatex them, grafoil is great stuff.  Strictly it isn't right to reuse, and they aren't THAT expensive, but I've done it without issue, and they've lasted just fine for tens of thousands of miles at least.  You don't get the &quot;crush&quot; of using a new one, but I feel the permatex makes up for it in the pinch sealing wise.  Gasket sets come/don't come with these variably,
 probably depending a lot on the original market for the gasket set, regardless all FI T4 from 914 to bus to vanagon came with these AFAIK, most specifically including any US spec FI Vanagon.  If you don't see a paper gasket on the block BTW, it is probably one of the grey grafoil gasketed ones and you are missing it, the gasket layer is well adhered to the block and quite thin.  Using the thick green paper gaskets instead would not be appropriate by themselves and too thick to use in conjunction with the existing phenolic block.

It just now occurred to me that perhaps the phonelic block is reusable, with
paper gaskets on each side? In and of itself, it sure is not going to seal
much, yet there was nothing on my engine, except the block, no paper, no
residue, or anything like that.
