Ok Listees,

I have a question but I don't mean to start a flame war. ;-)  With all the
supporters of fuel injection out there, how come no one has a fuel injected
1600 in their bus?  VW has had a number of fuel injected 1600s in the type 3
and later beetles.  It seems that with all the frustration out there over the
34 PICT 3 carbs someone would have tried to transplant a FI system from a
beetle or type 3.  I understand that the FI system on those engines is only
meant for &quot;stock&quot; type engines.  That is it should be a 1600 and not anything
larger and it should run a stock cam and exhaust (probably, don't know).  How
about it?  Is this a totaly lame idea?  Inquiring minds want to know.

I'm breaking my own rule here about &quot;better to remain silent and be thought a
fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt&quot;.  Any discussion?
