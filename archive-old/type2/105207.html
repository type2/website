Daniel,

Opinions abound, but it's safe (i think) to say that if you make a habit 
of driving over 230 or 240 degrees, you will shorten your engine life.  By 
how much may vary though.  Under 220 is good.  Under 230 is ok.  Under 235 
with stops after climbing long hills will work, but probably take 10,000 
miles or more off your engine life.  250-260 is bad, but you probably 
won't see catastrophic failure on a new-ish engine (at least I didn't).

In any event, beetles have a lot less mass to push around than buses, so 
hopefully these will be easier boundaries to keep within the limits of.

Cheers,
	tom
