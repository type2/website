Subject: westy with Rabbit 
Date: Tue, 13 Oct 1998 15:15:37 -0700
Encoding: 8 TEXT

In the paper this week is an ad for an '82 Westy with an '84 Rabbit engine. 
I've seen some discussion of this conversion somewhere- someone's website, 
I think.  It seemed pretty tough.  What are your opinions on the 
driveability/depandability of such a conversion?  They're asking $3800.

Gracias,
Bielavitz
