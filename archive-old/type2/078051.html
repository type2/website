Subject: Re: [T2] 15&quot; wheels




&gt;And what...  can't put the 15's on the 64-70?   I have a 70' and I &gt;would not
mind putting 15&quot; chromies on it...  otherwise I'll have &gt;to wait until I go
&gt;all disc and have them drilled out for a whole other type of &gt;wheel?

I have a set of 15's on my 67 EZ camper and I can't wait to get rid of them. WAY
too tall and the bus looks and handles like crap. A wanna-bee  Bigfoot!  Don't
even ask how far off the speedo is!  At least with split buses you can change
the speedo depending on wheel size. The ratio w/14'' is 0,77 and w/15'' is 0,80.
But bays don't have that option.

At first I thought she had a later bay until I realized she had a 68/69. 71 and
up only came with 14'' unless you want to put Mercedes wheels on.
