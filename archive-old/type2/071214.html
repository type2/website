Subject: Upgrading wiring to fuse box, a Question.
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Well, the subject line about says it all. I'm swapping in a 70amp alt., which 
has been built to 90amps by my Godlike alternator and starter guru.( This is 
going into a ' 78 Westy, 2.0L FI, BTW) So I'm wanting to upgrade the wiring 
from said. I'll run 8ga. from the alt to the starter terminal, but want to 
know if anyone out there has ran larger wire to the fuse box and ing. switch. 
If I'm reading the Bently right, it looks like I'm gonna have to run an 8ga. 
wire to the S9 lug of the fuse pannel, and also to the back-side of the ign. 
switch itself. Not gonna worry about the headlight switch, as I've already 
converted that to a relay operated system. Also gonna bring a 6ga. ground 
directly from the batt. to the front of the bus, and connect all those 
&quot;interesting&quot; chasis grounds to it. Thusly, if any of y'all have done what 
I'm thinking of doing, please tell me how 'ya did it, and if it was indeed 
worth the  hassle.
Thanks,
Robb
