Its time for some pre-spring cleaning. I would like to clear out a few buses 
that are sitting around. These buses would make great projects or parts 
buses. Have upwards of 10 buses to get rid of and tons of parts.

1-1971 Westy
2-1972 Westy

1-1979 Westy

Buses are located in Rockford, IL Pictures can be seen at:

All offers considered. I would like to see as many of these buses in new 
hands as possible. Thanks
