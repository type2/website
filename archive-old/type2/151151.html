Subject: Progressive vacuum advance problem?

I've had my new SVDA for a week, and I don't seem to be 
getting ANY vacuum advance, although the bus seems 
to appreciate the new points, cap &amp;amp; rotor.
It doesn't seem to matter if I connect the hose or not,
although sucking on the distributor seemed to make all 
the right things happen.

What vacuum should I be seeing at the port on the 
carburettor? (center mount Progressive DFEV was the 
consensus ...:)

How bad a sign is it that mine is too low to measure?
(slight suction on a finger over the tube but no reading
on a gauge at any RPM. Decent vacuum elsewhere in the system, 
although a drawn out hiss after shutting off the engine has got 
me crawling up and down looking for a leak on the way to the brake
booster).

The hose had been plugged with a screw and a hose clamp.
If enough gunk had been sucked past that, should I be able 
to blast it out, or is it time to take it apart?

To avoid lots of follow up questions from me, where do I find
an idiots guide to carb rebuilding and tuning?
