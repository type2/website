Subject: Weber 34ICT dual VS single progressive

Hey guys.... i have some customers on a budjet.. looking for carbs (1700 
&amp;1800cc type2 bus engine).

I have my way with the single prog. Weber... but i need feedback or 
comment on other options (icing is a problem here in Canada), the dual 
34 ICT look like a good option... remember, money IS an issue...  i see 
that those carbs doesn't have any choke.... any comments would be 
appreciated... what about those new Solex on the market???

Regards, Ben
