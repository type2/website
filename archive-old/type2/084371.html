   Good! Maybe the new sump sender will give a more proper reading. Did
they find an exhaust? That crappo header setup of his was really ratty
when he left here.

   Sorry to jump in on this so late, but I spent the last four days
doing my best to see that the fish on the Texas coast were well fed and
the bait stand operator's retirement fund grew.

&gt; Peter mentioned that he had his temp sender there, and that he was looking
&gt; for a sump-type sender.  Seemed funny to me too. Not that it would be
&gt; hotter, but I would prefer the oil-pressure-regulating-area to stay stock!
&gt; I had a sump-type sender on my workbench, so he will probably install it at
&gt; his next oil change.
