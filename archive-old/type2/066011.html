&gt;You are among several who have posted that it's illegal to retrofit old
&gt;vehicles w/ smog devices. I assume this is just in CA? Do you know if it
&gt;also applies if a later model engine was retrofitted, one that
&gt;originally came w/ these devices installed? I seem to recall, a number
&gt;of years ago, articles mentioning fitting 'converters into street
&gt;rods... but that may be a thing of the past.

The way I heard it was this:  In California, you can put a later model
engine in a car if that exact engine was available in the same car in a
later year in the US.  For example, you could put a '79 bus engine into a
'72 bus, and after some paperwork the smog stations would smog the '72 bus
as a '79 for smog purposes.  This means that from that point on, you would
be *required* to have all of the '79 bits, such as fuel injection,
catalytic converter, etc. in order for the '72 to pass the California Smog
Check.  What you could NOT do is put in a '76 type I engine from a European
type II, because that model was never sold in the United States.  You
cannot put in an engine from an older model year.  I often wonder how
strict they are with that &quot;same model&quot; requirement - would it be legal to
put a '93 Eurovan engine in a '72 bus (assuming it could be done)?  I don't
know the answer to that one.
