Subject: Dog house oil cooler &amp; pedestal questions

I'm building a franken motor for my '70 bus out of a bunch of 1600cc.

I purchased a doghouse oil cooler &amp; pedestal in hopes of converting
everything to dual port.
Only problem is that they did not come with hardware.
What do I need to install this?
And now that I am looking at it, I am confused as to how to mount it.
Help! hehe
