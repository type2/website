Seeing as everyone else is talking about valves tonight....

I bought a set of new 37.5x40 heads from Mark Stephens last 
year, but am finally getting around to working them over
for installation. I ploshed up the really rough intake and exaust
ports to keep them clean and to help flow, and knocked the
rough stuff off of the combustion chamber walls. I also 
stoned some major roughness off of the valve
cover sealing surfaces.

But, when I went to lapp in the valves I discovered that
the seats have been cut to 60 degrees, while the 
valves are cut to 45 degrees. It looked like the Mark Stephens
guy did the first step of my 3 angle valve job and forgot
steps 2 and three!! (I think I waited too long to bring it
to their attention now)

So, I must now take them to a local machine shop to
get the seats cut to 45 and 30 degrees. Any idea
what a fair price would be for a machine shop to do that?
All 8 valves, two different sizes. Are these common import car
sizes? (The clearance around the exaust valves is kinda
tight, they would have to have the right diameter tool.)

I just dont want to get fleeced, but if they offer a fair price, 
I want to get them done soon.
