Subject: Re: [T2] Long (dong silver) Mirror 

From: &quot;andy&quot; &lt;andy_at_pon.type2_dot_com&gt;
&gt; Sorry little guy :) Mine is 6&quot;. I just measured it. :)

Yowser!  So the mounting stem on my own mirror the smallest?

Then I'll have to either find the longer one down here, or find someone who
wouldn't mind my borrowing the longer stem for a little while.  I
disassembled my mirror, and while the inner glare mechanism is a bit more
complicated to reproduce than I'd expected, it's not impossible.  I can't
see reproducing the shorter stem, though, if the better one is available.

I'm also thinking of maybe adding a channel through the ball on the stem, up
through the stem for possibly wiring something (alarm LED?) inside of the
mirror.  Not that I'm exactly sure how to get the wires from the sending
device, up to the mirror mounting point on the roof...

&gt; &gt; ... noticed that the collar that accepts the ball seems
&gt; &gt; to be deteriorating...
&gt; This is pretty common and Id be glad to listen to suggestions on this
&gt; one.

The cup is the top of the glare adjusting mech.  Replacing it means
replacing the main part of the mech.  My mirror housing is severely sun
damaged.  Repair will probably replace the texturing on the back of the
housing with a different surface, but replacing the glare mech will
definitely take care of the deteriorated cup.  Not sure what to replace the
little friction disk in the cup with, so I'm saving mine for the new
housing.

&gt; I con only say from experience with 68 and 69. The long mirror is
&gt; identical mounting wise.

Thank you.
