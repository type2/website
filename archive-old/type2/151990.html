&gt; Somewhere in that algorithm is how much use the bus is going to get..
&gt; if it's your daily or a critical driver, even more so.   I'm not sure

that is a key factor in any decision,  what are you using your bus for,
how hard are you using it, how long will you keep it etc

in my case it is a daily driver, it is my only vehicle and I've had it for
13 years now and plan on keeping it as long as I can. so putting a few
bucks into is for me a good investment, other folks will have to make
other decisions, this goes not just for shocks but for everything you do
with your bus.

  is it a &quot;trailer Queen&quot;   or a &quot;rust Bucket&quot; or somewhere in between
only you can decide how good is good enough, just err on the safe side
when it comes to safety issues
