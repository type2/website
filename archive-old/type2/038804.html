&gt;&gt; Question #2
&gt;&gt;     When it rains, I get water on the floor under the dash.
&gt;&gt; Is my windshield seal or the front air vents  leaking?

&gt;Almost certainly the windshield.

My .02:  I found that surprisingly large quantities of water were leaking past the windshield washing fluid &quot;squirters&quot; on my 1970.  As a temporary fix (or determine whether this is your problem), affix some ductape above the squirters so that all water will be directed away from the base of the squirter.  This cured my wet floor problem.  Good luck,
