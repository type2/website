I agree 100%, and sometimes the local guy will drop the price if you tell
him that you can get the same Welder/Bus Parts/Tools from a larger place
mail order. If he came cut the price 10% and still get your business then he
still makes money. If you go mail order it, he makes nothing. Also, there
will be times when you need him for those welding supplies. This applies to
your local VW parts supplier as well as anything else.

Thank the man, and then go buy it at Harbor Freight .

It's Friday (almost), fair's fair.  I've done it too, but exploiting a local
small guy for his display and helpfulness and then saving a couple of bucks
buying the same rig by catalog is dim busma.  And on a less lofty level, who
do you think is going to help with your questions when you're up and
running?  I say buy local and buy small when you can.  When you can't, it
can't get any easier than it is now.
