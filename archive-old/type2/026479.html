&gt;1. Can I clean and reuse my oil cooler? How? Remanufactured 
&gt;ones are available($120) but why not remanufacture my own?

Just pour some gasolene in each of the holes of the cover, cover them with
your fingers or favorite rag and shake 'er up.  Dump out the gas and repeat
the process 2 or 3 times until the gas comes out clean.  I blow the thing
dry with my mondo-shop vac (DON'T VACUUM it dry!!!), but any compressed air
or even a nice, sunny day will dry it out.  Use appropriate precautions when
working with gasoline (duh!).

&gt;3. This one bugs me:  3 years ago, I replaced my alternator. the new 55 amp
&gt;had a round fitting where you attach the rubber &quot;L&quot; shaped hose from the
fan
&gt;shroud.  Well, I bought a new rubber piece at vw and it had a
&gt;three-quarter-moon shaped end instead of round.  So, there is no seal
&gt;connecting my alt to the cooling system, it just sorta blows in the

You kinda lost me on this one.  If I remember right, the original ones were
kinda oval-shaped where they attach to the alternator and round with a big
inside 'C' clip where they go into the fan housing.

--Do you mean the new rubber elbow has a different shape fitting?  If so,
they sold you the wrong one.  Use the old one or go get another one.
--Or do you mean the new alternator has a different shape fitting than the
old one did?  If so, use the back cover from an old alternator.
