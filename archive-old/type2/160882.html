Subject: Re: [T2] Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator with 34 pict 3

Or option D - Convert your existing linkage to the alternator version.
It is possible to take the linkage apart, flip one part over (the
inner piece), rotate the other part (the outer part) 180 degrees and
reassemble it so that it clears the alternator. (Note, some very minor
grinding of the alternator body may be required to allow full return
of the accelerator pump linkage, though with careful positioning of
the carb on the manifold this can usually be avoided). I had this
problem when I went from the Weber DCNF that came with my bus to the
34PICT3. Someone on the list was kind enough to send me pics of what
the reassembled linkage looks like, I have them available and can send
them off list to anyone who needs them.

Stacking lots of gaskets is a bad idea as I'm told you need the heat
that comes up through the heat riser tubes to the intake manifold to
keep your carb warm and prevent icing.

&gt; I found this in the Samba groups which might have some good info
&gt; http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=177529. I think the three
&gt; easiest are A. Find the alternator version linkage,  B. Grind the
&gt; alternator, but stack some gaskets under the carb so you don't have to grind
&gt; as much off, C. Make your own spacer by cutting the carb mounting surface
&gt; off a trashed manifold and filing the bottom flat. Good luck!
