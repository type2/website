Subject: muffler heat shield

Hey Volks,

You know that asbestos-laden rectangular heat shield that goes just above 
the muffler and is held in place by connections to a couple of rear tin 
screws? Mine is so rusty that the connectors have failed and it is 
falling off. It rattles terribly up there at idle, but I don't think it 
can actually fall out of there. It might though. I should do something. 

It's intended to insulate the rear tin from intense radiant heating from
the blazing hot muffler. So it's part of the cooling system. I want to
replace mine, but no one seems to sell them. I was just advised by one VW
shop to get some kind of insulating muffler tape made for racers and wrap
my muffler in the stuff. That could work, I guess. 

Anyone else ever replace this part? I was hoping to find some kind of 
non-asbestos, after market replacement. The Bus Depot seems not to have 
such a one. 

Anyone else run for extended periods without this part? Does bus run 
hotter? Do rear tin seals get crisped or melted? 

ANyone else ever implement a non-stock replacement for this part? What 
was it?

I guess I could MacGiver some bailing wire solution to hold my crumbling 
original in place until it rusts away to nothing. Would be nice to lose 
the asbestos though. 

All wise commments welcome,
