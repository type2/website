I have been reading about busses and poptops, and hightops. Shame on VW 
for not making a hightop latemodel bus. Early busses had the option of 
ordering a 6 ft tall steel top. Now I am not one to do this to anything 
as rare as that, but a 60's model hightop bus with a camper pop top 
would be awesome! Think of the cool cabinets and storage available!

Ok so it would be very top heavy so to speak....
