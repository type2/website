Subject: T2] Westy florescent interior light replacement needed

Hi folks:

The fluorescent light on my 78 Westy finally fried out the other day.  
the switch was wonky but it stayed off.  Then it started to turn itself 
on and drain the battery.  Bad thing.  Especially when parked in 
Sacramento on a street at night after a 12-hour day.  Bad thing indeed.

When I jumped the bus, the switch and circuit board in the light arced 
and smoked.  I assume the unit is fried.  After removing the unit, I 
tested the wires with a VOM and they were OK.

So, I guess I need another light for the camper.  I'd like something 
which fits in the existing hole.  Does anyone on the list know where I 
could get one?

Thanks,

BEN
