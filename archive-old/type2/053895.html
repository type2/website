You almost certainly have an 091 trans in your bus.

&gt;will the 81 engine fit in the 77bus with a 77-79 trans?

It will bolt up, yes.

&gt;What does Tom Wilson mean by unique case and heads?

The case is different in the oil breather area (minor) and also where the
case meets the fan housing.  So you will either have a mismatch between the
79 fan housing and the case, or between the 81 fan housing and your engine
tin.  Neither situation would be acceptable to me.

&gt;Any one out there done this?

Yes, I bought an '81 Vanagon engine for my '73.  I ended up not using the
Vanagon case, but instead put the internals of the Vanagon engine inside an
old '72 case.  Voila, hydraulic 2-liter with no fitment problems, and it
will even fool the California smog nutzis.  I'll admit that it was a lot of
trouble, but if the price is right on the Vanagon engine, hey, it may be
worth it.
