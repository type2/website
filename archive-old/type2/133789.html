Subject: '77 Automatic FI

Well list I am back again.

Senario:  1977 (Manufacture date Nov. 76), Westy Automatic Trans., currently 
Webberized(Single Progressive), needs to go back to stock FI. Simple to put 
together parts list, hard to rob a bank and make the get away to pay for 
with this Webber. I have some one willing to put together a complete setup 
affordably (Parts from '76-'79).I have been told by many that a complete 
system from any of those years would work reguardless of year of Bus.

Questions: Is this true? Does this apply to Automatics as well? Are there 
any interchangable parts? Or better yet does anyone know the parts that 
can/should not be interchanged?

Access Bob I think we started with this back in November (ECU...What's the 
Difference?), but I want to make sure this pitch is not a curve ball before 
I start swinging away. TIA.

TravelOn,

Michael Knight '77 Westy Deluxe, AT  &quot;el Verde&quot;
