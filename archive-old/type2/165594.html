&gt; &gt; When I am climbing up the highway on my way over Mt. Hood I can go 45 in 4th gear or 3rd gear, in one its wound up pretty good, in the other it is lugging, in which case am I running cooler?
&gt;
&gt; Right off the bat, I would automatically say 3rd.

It's not so much the gear as the throttle position.  I generally climb
hills at about 3/4 throttle and select the gear that this throttle setting
will support.  VW said that their engines could be run at WOT all day, but
it never hurts to be a bit more conservative.
