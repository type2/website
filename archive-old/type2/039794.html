Since when did this list turn into a bill collecting service?  I'm
surprised this item was allowed to be sent out to the list.  Certainly this
is a personal matter between Mr. Sage and Mark Stephens.  Perhaps Mr. Sage
is not a very good business man for allowing the bill to becoming so large .
Mr. Stephens may have a legitimate reason for not paying Mr. Sage.
