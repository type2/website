{Deleted text}

Ever optimistic, I oiled up my new Bosch Platinum plug and gingerly started
it in the remaining threads.  It took.  I threaded it in all the way, and
then tightened it just a tad more (per Muir) to seat the seal.  I've now
driven it over 100 miles and it's still in there.  


=============
Instead of oil to lube the spark plug threads, use a high temperature
anti-sieze compound.  Oil will &quot;bake&quot; at cylilnder head temps and cause
problems ( as you have discovered).
