&gt; Hello Fine List People:
&gt; 
&gt; We're all familiar with the spare tire mounted on the front of a bus,
but has anyone mounted a spare on the back hatch, kind of SUV-style??  I
figure you could use the same mounting kit as used for the front.  Also,
the sheet metal may have to be reinforced, and maybe a lift-gate shock
absorber-type of thing may need to be added to handle the extra weight of
the tire.  Has anyone done this??

A few years back I saw a rear tire carrier at a wrecking yard.  it was
made of 1-1/4 inch square tubing and mounted to the bumper with swivels
and to the right below the rear hatch with a pip pin.  The pin could be
released and the tire swung down to access the engine hatch and, I
suppose, the rear hatch (I couldn't tell if a tire, when mounted, would
obstruct the hatch)

I wouldn't do it to my bus, but it was perferable to the front-mounted
spare in terms of the damage and potential damage to the bus.
