Subject: Re: [T2] Multiple Gauges - Dead Gauge?

Hi Tim,

The gauges fit fine, and look like they were designed to go there.  
Removing the ashtray and glove compartment beforehand helps quite a  
bit with the install. Measure carefully to find the centre point.  
Then measure inwards from the radio edge to align the outer gauges  
with the edge of the radio. Check to make sure the centers of all  
three gauges line up vertically. Mark carefully, then measure again,  
twice. Drill the center points with a 1/8&quot; drill bit. The foam is a  
bit less than 3/4&quot; deep before you hit metal. Once the pilot holes  
are in, have at it with the hole saw.

I used a good 2&quot; hole saw (50.8mm) and then carefully enlarged the  
hole in the metal with a dremel tool until the gauges fit nice and  
snug. The result was so snug that my gauges don't need the retainer  
clips on the back to stay in place.

&gt; greg,
&gt;
&gt; I'm getting ready to install 3 gauges in the space you're talking  
&gt; about- below the radio &amp; above the ash tray. How tight was the fit,  
&gt; in your case? Did you cut the dash to install the gauges? Any hints  
&gt; or help would ease my mind, thanks!
