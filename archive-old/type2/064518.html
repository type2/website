Ron Van Ness re-posted a blurb regarding the possible existence of some
ultra-sensitive folk on the list.

VanBondo says,
Uh, could I have a list of these folks and their hot buttons so I could do a
better job of what I do? ;-) ROFLMAO
&lt;I'm kidding!, I'm kidding!&gt;

The following is a new list acronym:
CIA &lt;---- &quot;chill in advance&quot;
- - - - 
Look, that is not an appropriate acronym.   I hope that you and other law
abiding citizens of this great country have a little more respect for our
governmental agencies.  And why don't you go live in Russia or China if that
is the way you think of the USA?
