Subject: baseline run  made  ??? is oil way to high??

Just completed a run to establish a baseline for my westy on the gauges.
Anyone familiar with denver metro
ran from i225/colfax to  kipling/colfax At the peak heat 93 degrees 
ambient.  Did the approx  18 miles in constant stopping and idling

stop go snail pace  of colfax.
oil temp climbed to 270 range heads 320 degree high 290 low

used the highway 6 to 25 around east to 6th/225 avg speed 60
oil  dropped  to about 240  heads going uphill 370 to 400 flat  level 
300 to 320

These  oil temps seem  to high.   they are much higher than my type 1 
bugs with 1915s in them did.  Only addition to the bugs was  a  deep 
sump.

oil pressure in the 20 to 30 range on the highway.
