Subject: High-Speed Missing: Electric or Fuel?

Hey All --
Just got back from a 3000+ mile road trip from Oregon to the Arches, Mesa
Verde, and Grand Canyon national parks (and back) in my girlfriend's 77
bus.  Great fun, but we had our share of anomalies -- and there is one I
want to ask about.  Cruising SW through the incredible Monument Valley (UT)
at 60-65 MPH, we noticed some irritating scratchy sounds coming from our
door-mounted speakers, nearly drowning out my Neil Young tape.  Immediately
after, I felt the engine miss significantly.  I turned the cassette player
off. Over the next 45 miles or so, it would miss intermittently (like, once
every 5-10 miles or so) and did so enough to make me want to stop and take
a peek into the engine compartment for anything noticeable.  Nothing.  The
engine continued to do this for the duration of the trip: intermittent
single misses at high speed.  Having had to deal with various fuel-related
problems in my 79 bus, I began to think &quot;fuel filter.&quot;  However, over the
miles as the missing would apparently subside and we would became tired of
the silence, we would try the cassette player/radio again and after awhile
it would again emit scratchy noises and then the engine would very
noticeably miss soon after (and continue to do so at intermittent
intervals).  It became obvious that the two events were related.  My &quot;fuel
filter&quot; theories quickly changed to &quot;electrical&quot; but I have no other clues.
 (I do know that the wires under her dash are a real scary rat's nest, and
began to think that there might be an exposed wire touching a wrong place
somewhere.)  Anyway, does anyone have an idea of what connection there
might be between the stereo and the performance of the engine, and/or how I
can investigate further, and/or how I can fix it?  Thanks for your ideas!
