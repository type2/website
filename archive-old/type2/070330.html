Re: The Lost Treasure of Linden Lure

I called Tom M. the day after he stood me up for our trip to find the 
Busses.  &quot;This number has been disconnected or is no longer in service.&quot;

I was not too suprised.
I *was* susprised, however, to receive a call yesterday from a Dr. Cohen 
who is Tom's daughter's physician.  He apologized for interrupting my 
busy day, but he just *had* to know if I had any vintage Mustang parts in 
my garage.  I seems that Tom had told him that I was the vice-president 
of Bass Pro Shops (no, just senior P/A) and that I had a stash of NOS 
early Mustang parts.  &quot;You mean you don't have any convertible tops?&quot;

I had to laugh.  Apparently Tom knew which buttons to push for a Mustang 
fanatic as well as a Bus nut.  As I told the good Doctor *my* story of 
misinformation, bad directions, and missed or postponed meetings I could 
hear him mumbling words of agreement ... BTDTBTTS.  

I now have outside confirmation that Tom is a pathelogical liar (sp?), 
but you all knew that already.

Fool me once?  Shame on you.  Fool me twice?  Hey, we're talkin' 
VOLKSWAGENS! ;-)
