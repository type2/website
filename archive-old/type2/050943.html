My bus is 30 years old. I wouldnt do this to it. Sometimes , in a fit of
envelope pushing I go 70 for a little while in the desert. Mostly 65 ish.
The technology is old, I love it, and put my life on it daily. However....

&gt; held it at 79mph for any length of time.  This would require full
&gt; throttle and nearly 5000rpm in my bus.
