&gt; &gt; But you know when that dark nite of the soul and out-of-gas feeling
&gt; &gt; comes over you, it will be home waiting for you and that old piece of
&gt; &gt; water hose will be right there... ;-P

Which is why a long piece of 1/2 inch clear tubing resides in the parts
box.

Syphoning tips:

1. Use the pump if you have one  Otherwise go to step 2.
2. Use a clear hose long enough to go from the gas level in the tank out
of the filler, down to the ground, and then back up to the filler.
Stick the hose into the tank, making sure that the end is well below the
fuel level.
3. Allow a loop to droop to the ground while holding the free end in your
hand.
4. Keeping your mouth above the filler opening, suck on the hose until the
fuel in the hose reaches the ground.  If you keep the end of the hose
above the fuel filler, the gas will never make it to the end of the hose
unless you suck it there (and you won't).
5. Put your thumb over the free end of the hose and put the end of the
hose into the gas can to be filled.
When the can is nearly filled, lift the entire can above the level of the
fuel filler on the bus.  Now the syphon hose can be removed without
spilling a drop.

The above technique was sharpened over years of riding dirt bikes with
people who were too cheap to pop for a large capacity tank.  I ended up
being the &quot;tanker&quot; more times that I can count.  If you think that
straight gas tastes bad, try a mouthful of 2-stroke mix.  Pleh!
