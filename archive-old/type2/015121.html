	Stephen,

	It's allways fun to read about someone doing the same misstakes as
oneself:-) The second time I &quot;flanged&quot; my exhaust system I did it the
following way:
 I welded the flanges straight on the unshortened heat exchangers. This way
you can even go back to donuts (God forbid) and clear the engine support
bar. And it's easier to weld this way if you have the heat exchangers on
the bus. I shortened the mufflers tubes instead, mufflers have a shorter
lifespan than heat exchangers and they are cheaper to do misstakes on.......  

To make the welding process easier I made the holes in the flanges big
enough so the tubes would fit into them. I slid the tube halfway into the
flange and welded on the inside. This way you don't have the problem with
the nuts and welding seam. And it really looks proffessional with no
visible welding seams. You just have to grind them with a rotating file so
they don't resrict the exhaust flow too much.

&gt;Ok,

&gt;What I learned:
&gt;
&gt;  -- The #1 issue is alignment, the two flanges must be in sync for the bolt
&gt;holes to line up.
&gt;  -- I believe Hoover and others recommend putting the muffler and heat
&gt;exchangers on the bus to do the welding.  I started by welding the flange on
&gt;the muffler, outside the car, then grinding it down to get a perfect seal.
&gt;However, to ensure alignment of the two flanges (hole to hole alignment), I
&gt;put it on the bus before doing the heat exchanger side.  This doesn't work
&gt;well at all on 1968 later busses with support bar.
&gt;  -- I also put a set on my new engine for 1963 truck, no support bar.  This
&gt;welding wasn't easy for me.  You are trying to weld a circular seam, not
&gt;cover the bolt hole areas, and well -- for me it isn't easy.  And also just
&gt;as difficult to grind the mistakes off :)  You have to get the weld right at
&gt;the seam where the pipe and flange meet, all the way around.
&gt;  -- Then of course, I consider that what if I want to swap parts -- gee,
&gt;what is the likely hood that any of my muffler / heat exchangers sets are
&gt;going to match alignment of the bolt holes :)

In Finland we use to say: Tekemällä opit!

Eh, you want that translated? By doing it you will learn!

If freezing in a VW bus makes a man out of me,
