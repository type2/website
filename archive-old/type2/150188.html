&gt;     Hey volks, what is this thing?  Gray, about 12 inches long, maybe 2-3 
&gt; inches wide, with squeeze clips.  It has rounded corners, and was setting 
&gt; in the battery tray.  part 211 945 285, which I googled and all I can find 
&gt; is that it's a &quot;Cap&quot;.
 

Jay.. I think it is the wire trough cover for your tail lamp housing... it 
goes on the front*  [FIF] of the tail lamp holder probably right beside 
where you found it... compare to the other side and see how it fits... 
hopefully your other side is in place to look at.
