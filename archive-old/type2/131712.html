Subject: Re: [T2] Dual Battery Relay

I wonder if this is why my fridge does not work. Well it maybe other 
problems. I connected the shore power and can use the electrical outlet but 
no fridge. I thought it was supposed to be able to work on shore power, or 
am I just wrong here?

You don't happen to have an additional set of wires over there too do you? I 
still have not been able to locate the ones that Karl spoke of for the fuel 
pump. Maybe the PO cut them out.

These two wires are the power leads to the inverter and fridge,
&gt;etc. One is ground, the other power. If your fridge IS working and has been
&gt;connected to the main battery you can reconnect them to the dual battery,
&gt;via your new relay. As far as I know the dual battery only ran the fridge
&gt;and sink pump.
