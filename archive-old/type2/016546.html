I just picked up a '64 accessories brochure that shows that A/C was
available that early (at least for beetles).  I have seen a '73 Bus with
&quot;factory&quot; A/C altho this may have been dealer-installed...  The thing I
learned while working at a VW dealer in the late '80s: Most of the early
VW accessories were Dealer installed as it cost quite a bit more for the
factory to do it.  If it wasn't Dealer installed it was &quot;Port Installed&quot;
wherever it came into the US...  This is still true today with some
models.

    The dealership I worked for was Gateway Motors Inc.  in Nashua NH.
Gunther Mattoni (owner now retired) was one of the first 25 VW engineers
to come to the states to teach the &quot;Dealers&quot; how to service the cars
(this started in 1955 with the founding of VWoA).  At that time most of
the &quot;Dealers&quot; were small corner garages that sold several different
lines of Imports.  Hoffman was one of the rare Major distributers.  When
Gateway started in 1962 Gunther was given the distribution franchise to
most of northern New England.  They were exclusively VW until the mid
'80s when they picked up a Mazda franchise.

    Take care...
