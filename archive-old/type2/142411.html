&gt; I have a '79 bus with the stock California emissions setup with the cat

&gt; keep the stock emissions set-up. I've babied this exhaust system for 15
&gt; years and everything but the muffler is in excellent shape so I will
&gt; keep it. The muffler itself has been patched and patched and patched

The part number you want is 071-251-053C.

Leistritz and Ernst (German) have stopped making this mullfer. Maybe BD has some left. You can find Dansk (Denmark) and ANSA (Italy) at various vendors.
