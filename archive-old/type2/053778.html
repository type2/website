Subject: Re: Wiring Harness for '70

Robert Clark sends:

&gt; I'm restoring a 70 standard and have run into some problems regarding
&gt; wiring.  That is - the guy who owned it before me thought of himself as some
&gt; sort of electricity guru and replaced all of the original wiring with his
&gt; own black and red wire (at least he did use 2 colors).  So I've decided to
&gt; just rewire the whole thing.  The fusebox is still intact and in good shape,
&gt; I have the requisite switches etc. but I can't seem to find the actual
&gt; wiring loom from anyone.  Pre-68 sure - a complete harness is available, but
&gt; not for a 70.  I can find a main loom easily but I would rather spend the
&gt; extra money and rewire all of it.
&gt; 
&gt; any help would be appreciated...

Since they don't allow you to shoot people just because they need it (&quot;he
needed killin&quot; is no longer a usable defense even in North Carolina), and
this guy does, you may be pleased to know that JCWhitney sells kits
consisting of rolls of about 20 different colors of wire. Get one of those
and a pound of push-ons (where you can get push-ons by the pound I don't
know, and believe me when I tell you I'm looking!) and rewire it one wire at
a time.
