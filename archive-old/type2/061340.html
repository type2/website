Subject: Fuel Injected 1600

This was an old thread that seemed to be dropped.  I couldn't quit.

So here's where idea # 345B comes in:  I wanna try this.

Use the manifolding from the D-Jetronic system.  The manifolds, runners,
and throttle body/generator stand, auxillary air valve,  from the old
type 3 or 75up bug.

Get a CIS fuel system from one of the 4 cylinder european cars from
between about 73-83.  Need the fuel pump, fuel distributor(rail),
pressure regulator, air flow meter, air cleander housing, thermo-time
switch, ECU, injectors, etc.

The systems should be pretty compatible.

Whadda Ya Get?

Better Volumetric Efficiency, Better low RPM power (including better low
speed torque, which our busses need), better high RPM fuel delivery, and
probably better mpg.

Sounds interesting, huh?

I put up a page with more info for those interested:

Lemme Know whatcha Tink (especially if you have an old FI system for a
1600 laying around;)
