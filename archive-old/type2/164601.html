Subject: Hankook tire query...update

Thanks to those who have replied so far on my questions about the Hankook
RA-08 tires in the 195 series, 14 inch size.  It seems that out of all the
comments that only one person actually may have those particular tires on a
Westy.  He commented that they were &quot;squirrely on the highway&quot; - not what I
really wanted to hear!  I'm still waiting to hear back from him if indeed he
was talking about these particular Hankooks or some other tire.  So are there
any others that have actual experience with this particular tire and series
size who can give us a review.  I REALLY can't afford to blow 4-500 bucks on a
set of tires and be unhappy with them.

Everything else I've read on the Hankook site and Bus Depots site seems to
suggest that this tire ought to be great for my '87 Westy.  High inflation (up
to 65 psi), stiff reinforced sidewalls, a little taller than my old Michelin
MXL 205/70R14.  I'm still hoping that someone out there will measure the outer
circumfrence of an inflated Hankook RA-08 195 series tire.  If any of you out
there have this tire, could you also send me what it says on the sidewall
about the sidewall plys?  My Michelins have a circumfrence around the middle
of the inflated (say 32psi) tread width of 79 1/2 inches and they say
&quot;reinforced&quot; and &quot;2 Rayon sidwall plys&quot;.  Ron of the Bus Depot, any chance you
could you fill in any more info on this particular tire?  Your staff (very
nice and helpful) could only tell me what I could read on your website and
obviously didn't have a tire mounted/inflated to take a measurement from.

Eagarly waiting to hear more about these tires...
