Yup denser is better as far as the intake charge is concerned. But if a carb
isnt provided with some heat and a center mounted carb on an aircooled would
not get much on its own, the venturi of the carb would make the air so cold
that it would 'ice' up. I'll leave the gory details to George, but think
Bertolli principle, in fact it dosnt have to be really cold, a cool humid
day would do it.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Nope, I like some heat in those manifolds, especially for colder

&gt; Hmm, wouldn't a cooler intake temp. (short of actual &quot;icing&quot;), result
&gt; in a denser (i.e. higher &quot;mass&quot;) air fuel mixture? Optimally, I thought
&gt; an engine should take its air from the coolest point possible away
&gt; from engine or any other source of heat?
