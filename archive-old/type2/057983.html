Subject: First Day of Driving and New Yokohama Tires

Drove my 71 7 passenger for the first time last Friday.  This is the bus
purchased for $200 with no motor, bad main wiring harness, and no
headlights.  All of these have been addressed, but the bus needed new
tires desperately.

Used Discount Tire Center and purchased 4 Yokohama Y356 185R14C tires
last Friday afternoon.  They had me in and out in one half hour.  These
tires make the bus drive and handle extremely well.  I am very pleased
with the purchase.  I will let you know what I think of them over the
next year.
