Ok...  I'm not sure if I have a dual or a single advance.  When I checked
the manuals, the timing settings were based on an engine code and a dizzy,
and did not mention single or double advance dizzys.  I have one vacuum
line coming from the bottom left of the vacuum chamber that runs to the
carb, and a line on the back that runs to the exhaust manifold.  Does this
sound right.  Is this single or double.

&gt; that!  Much less could affect your performance and much more WILL be very
&gt; bad for your engine.  If you have a single advance distributor idle timing
&gt; should be about 5-10 degrees.  Whatever it takes to wind up with 30 degrees
&gt; maximum.  It really sounds like you have a carburetor flooding problem.

The power is pretty good, although the idle is a bit rough.  I also get
backfiring occasionally when I let off the acc. pedal over about 40mph.
Not always, but fairly frequently.  

I too think that there is too much gas running throught the carb.  I've
got to check the float and needle valve.  Anything else to look for?

Cheers,

Tom
