Hi all,

     Got quite a few replies. Also have a problem w/access right now, 
using a machine at Kinkos, can't afford much of this. Here's the deal: I 
expect the stuff'll be there for about a week. We're already gone, so 
delivery is out of the question-wasn't any room in the truck anyway. 
Anyone in Austin is welcome to go get what they want, might want to post 
to the list after you get it and save someone else a trip. Address is:

20 Olmos Dr.
Austin, TX 78744

Sink is behind the house (no fences or anything, shouldn't be any trouble 
grabbing it. Hubcaps are in the sink. Not in the greatest shape, but I 
expect they're workable. 

I know there are listees in Austin, so perhaps a plea to the list will 
help if you want it shipped. Sorry about the short notice, moving's been 
quite hectic. Don't expect I'll be checking mail much over the next week 
or so, half my machine is in a truck somewhere between Texas and Cali, 
and Kinko's costs too much... Phone for me is (I think) 916 989 0335. 
Check the phone for Jeff Morrow if that's wrong. Keep in mind, if you 
call asking about this I probably won't know much unless I've checked in 
again...


Hope all is well with y'all... Moving sucks. But hey, I'm looking forward 
to a run to Kings Canyon once it's all over...  ;-)


Peace,
