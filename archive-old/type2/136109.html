Subject: Stripped Intake bolts...

Man.... I feel like such an idiot. I thought I was experienced enough and past the days of stripping bolts and stuff... apparently not! :)

Well, it looks like I managed to strip the threads on TWO of my intake bolts on the drivers side of my 1800 T4 motor... :( :(

Before I make it worse, can someone make a suggestion as to what I should do at this point? I figure my next step is to install a helicoil in the holes. Does the Bus Depot sell ones? Should I go with one that will allow me to use the factory bolts?

Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks!!!

Todd
