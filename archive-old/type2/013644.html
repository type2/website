&gt; Subject: Stolen Bus alert
&gt;
&gt; Hello Ron,
&gt;
&gt; I just got a message that a stolen bus could be recovered. It's the
&gt; yellow 16&quot; Syncro Crewcab of Andreas Lidl, Germany. It was stolen 23 
&gt; Jan 2001 in Duisburg. In the week before last week the van could be
&gt; recovered in Amsterdam. It has been detected during a regular traffic
&gt; control. The van got a new VIN-number, and the odometer was set to 
&gt; lower kms. And it was loaded with stolen good until top the roof. The 
&gt; Syncro is still in nice condition, only some new scratches has been 
&gt; added. The right owner seems to be lucky, I got the message from 
&gt; reliable third party. Please forward this message to the stolen bus 
&gt; alert list.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you
&gt; Helmut
&gt; '80 Vanagaudi
