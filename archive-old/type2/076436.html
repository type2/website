Subject: Re: [T2] Welding your VW --go to college

Yes, if you can get to a community college, take their intro classes in both
gas and electric.  Make friends with the instructors and you can come back
and use their fancy tools even after the course ends.  They usually don't
charge hardly anything.

Who says you shouldn't play with fire?

Regards,

Grant
