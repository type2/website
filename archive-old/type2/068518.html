Thats me !!

Well, um, actually I have a type 3 !!  However I find useful mech stuff
here, and am thinking of pushing the squareback into a convenient river
and getting either a beetle or a bus.  My biggest gripe with the type3
cooling troubles.  At least some of the trouble may be that the car is
a 69, came with a 71 motor, and I dont know if some important bit of
tin ware has been &quot;lost&quot;.  I'll be finding out more about retrofitting
it this weekend, but apparently it is rather arkward.

However a question :
What sort of fuel economy do people get out of the normally aspirated
upright motors (say a 71) around town and on the highway?  Are there
big differences between motor sizes?  Reading Bob's sermons, CDI seems
the way to go.

Thanks
Andy
