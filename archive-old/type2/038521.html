Subject: Re: LEDs in the dash (was '69 electrical FIXED!!)

Andy,

You are correct; I don't know much about this (I *did*
know what LED stood for, though;-), but I'm curious
enough to keep experimenting.

Armed with the info from your e-mail, I went back to
Radio Shack and did a little more checking and found
that you were correct. 

I found &lt;with the help of a seemingly knowledgeable
sales person&gt; a 1.2v LED that could be used with a
resistor (I forget which size), that produced
3,000mcd, vs. the 23mcd that my test-subject had. I
assume that this is not a linear projection (the
3,000mcd is not actually 130.4 times brighter than the
23mcd), but that it's still *substantially* brighter.

So here's the current problem (no pun intended); all
the LEDs I see are colored (red, yellow, green, blue),
but the lights I want to replace are clear... Also,
the 3,000mcd is only available in red. The other
colors drop substatially in intensity/brightness from
there.

I suppose I could go with green LED's behind the
turn-signal indicators and generator light, blue
behind the high-beams and parking light indicators,
and red behind the oil-pressure light....but what
color would I use for the guage-cluster lighting
itself??? It would have to be bright, so that limits
my selection to red, or blue....neither of which
sounds too appealing!

Also, if I went to a colored-LED, I'd do my new VDO
guages as well, so...red is out, as the red-needles on
my new VDO's will register as black (right???). Blue
would only be slightly better (I imagine they'd be a
bright purplish color)....still not a good option.

My whole point in attempting this, is to not only be
able to see my guages better at night (especially in
traffic), but to get my stock guages on par with the
'brightness' of the new VDOs. As it is, the new VDOs
are so bright, they overpower the old ones, making it
hard to make a quick glance at the speedo and be able
to read it without waiting for my eyes to adjust. Does
that make any sense??? I can't see any better way to
explain it.

So...I may just end up putting the new VDOs on a
potentiometer, and dimming them to match the old,
unless I can find a better way. 

As usual, any help is greatly appreciated!

&gt; OK you misunderstand LEDS I see.
&gt; An LED is a Light Emitting DIODE.
&gt; If you know diodes you know that they are like a one
&gt; way valve for DC.
&gt; In the reversed polarity they pass no current and
&gt; also do not light.
&gt; In the forward bias position they pass current and
&gt; light up, BUT...
&gt; Diodes have particular voltage drop due to the
&gt; physics of the junction
&gt; inside.
&gt; Typical silicon diodes (red, green,yellow, amber)
&gt; have approx a
&gt; 1.2V or so drop. Some of the new type diodes (blue)
&gt; have a highr voltage
&gt; drop ~4v. But they have low resistance and will burn
&gt; up unless a resistor
&gt; is added in series to limit the current.
&gt; LEDs have a working current (perhaps 20ma) so if you
&gt; want to use a
&gt; typical diode in a 12V circuit..
&gt; R=voltage/current   voltage on the resistor=12-1.2(v
&gt; drop for led)=10.8
&gt; current we want is 20ma(the led working voltage)
&gt; so 10.8/20ma=540 ohms
&gt; now we dont want the resistor to fry so we need to
&gt; figure whe wattage we
&gt; need  watts=VA or 10.8*.02=.216 Watts typical
&gt; resistors come in 1/4w 1/2 w
&gt; etc. if you use a 1/4w it will be close to the
&gt; rating and will get pretty
&gt; hot so id use at least a 1/2w but prob a 1watt.
&gt; circuit    +-------&gt;&gt;&gt;|-------RRRR-----G

&gt; 
&gt; Sorry if this got so long.
&gt; the 12v leds you found were probably made with a
&gt; resistor as a lamp
&gt; replacement.
