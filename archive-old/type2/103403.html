&gt;What do you flush the evap and condensers with before they go back into service?

I know this one.  There is a special flush for this purpose.  It is very expensive - about $40/gallon last time I checked.  I simply blew this through my condenser and evaporator with compressed air, but I think A/C shops have a machine that circulates this stuff through instead (a much better way to do it, I'm sure).

&gt;FWIW I plan to use both systems with rotary compressors - bus will be Corvair powered by then and the Beetle is Type IV powered (all custom shrouding so not stock bus with the thin pulley).

Cool.  (pun intended!)

&gt;Any new info on the good, bad, and ugly of replacement refrigerants? No R-12 for me. I bought a 30 pound cylinder (was it 30?) back in '95 to store for later and the damn thing leaked all of it out within a year . Lots of $$$ gone poof!

Ouch.  Sorry to hear that.  I have used R134a and Freeze-12 in my bus.  134a works okay but Freeze-12 works better.  Some people seem to have an aversion to Freeze-12 because it is a blend.  After doing a bit of research, I am betting (my compressor) that it will work fine provided that Ester is used as the lubricant.  With mineral oil, I would not use anything other than R-12.
