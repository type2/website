The relay is ALOT easier to install then this, and you do not have to pull
with push buttons, etc., it all re,mains stock.

&gt; walt-
&gt; what you need is one of 2 things. the first is called a push-button. it is
a
&gt; button in your cab that activates your solenoid. i'm not sure how to do
this,
&gt; but i do know how to do the second. hook a new wire with a
&gt; female spade to the ignition terminal on your solenoid., and wire it to
your
&gt; battery.
&gt; turn the key in the on position and touch the wire to the + terminal.
should
&gt; start it
&gt; everytime. it is most likely that the wiring is fried, and this will be
your
&gt; best bet to solve that.

&gt; &gt; Hello Listers:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've checked the Type 2 archives, and I kinda know what to do next but
some
&gt; &gt; hand-holding and reassurance from the list would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My wife and I took the '76 Campmobile camping at Ocean Shores, WA this
&gt; &gt; weekend and all was well until the trip home.  The bus started just fine
&gt; &gt; after packing up at our campsite.  We stopped for gasoline about 60
miles
&gt; &gt; into the return trip and, after fill-up, when I turned the key all we
got
&gt; &gt; was a &quot;click&quot; from the starter.  A couple of dirt bikers gave us shove
away
&gt; &gt; from the pumps and we bump started the engine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When we got home I checked the Bentley manual and performed the &quot;lights
on&quot;
&gt; &gt; test.  The headlights go out when the starter switch is engaged.  I
cleaned
&gt; &gt; the battery terminals (even put in a new battery) and still no go.  The
&gt; &gt; lights still go out when the switch is engaged.  Where do I go from
here?
&gt; &gt; Perform the jumper wire test?  Whack the stater with a hammer?  Could it
be
&gt; &gt; that the wires at the starter might be corroded?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any and all suggestions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Best regards,
