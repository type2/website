Here in Orygun we don't really get that much cold weather.  But the average
temps have been 14 degrees in the morning.  Topping out at about 33 degrees
for the past week.  As some of you may not know, I parked my bus about a month
ago in favor for a Thing.  (forgive me Albert for I have sinned).  The Thing
fired right up this morning as always.  I looked at the bus, hmmmmm.   While
the Thing was warming up I gave the bus a try.  Vrrrrooooommmm!  The only I
really do for my Volkies is keep them tuned and I run 30 wt. oil in the
winter.  The only trouble I've had so far during this cold spell is 90 wt in
the transaxle seems a little stiff.  So I've taken to backing in the front
yard so I just split in the morning.  
    Peace, Love, and BTW I've finally put the top up on the Thing
tonight....&lt;sneeeeze&gt;
