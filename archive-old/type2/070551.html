Subject: Gas Heater for ' 78 Westy Needed.
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Well, with cold weather approaching, my wife has decreed that I've got to get 
an aux. source of heat for my Westy, or buy water pumper car to drive her and 
our new son around in. So, as I don't really want to buy another car, I 
thought I'd ask the List if anybody out there had a line on where I might get 
my hands on a BA-4 for my ' 78 Westy. Any ideas?
Thanks,
Parker
