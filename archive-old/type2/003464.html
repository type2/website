--+AD4-Can anyone recommend, or does anyone have any experience in installing
+AD4-auto-retracting shoulder-lap belts for the front seats in a Bay Window
+AD4-bus (1971).

Hi Lauria

I fitted some to my 79, but it took a little while to fathom them out, as
they came in a box listing numerous models they were designed to fit.
There's loads of brackets and washers, some of which you discard, but when
its all together it works just like a modern car. Ideally try and get
somebody to explain the kit to you, though this is a bit hard if like me you
get them mail order.
