Subject: stallin' 78

So ... I'm driving along ... bus all warmed up running well ... then I put the
clutch in and slow down for a stop sign and I stall.  This seems to happen
more often when it is warmed up.  It sort of comes and goes.  I thought maybe
I was just idling a little low so I checked the idle and it was like 900 rpms
when parked.  I also thought it might be a dirty fuel filter as ... my gas
tank is pretty bad inside but the filter I took off didn't seem too bad.  Any
suggestions.

I haven't actually noticed the stalling since I changed the fuel filter but
... given the filter didn't seem too bad I don't think that was the problem.
