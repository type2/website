Subject: RE: Synthetic oil

Bob writ :
&quot;If you ever meet somebody with astronomical mileage on their engine, ask
them how often they change the oil. I have and the answer is never &quot;every
5000 miles, just like the manual says&quot;. &quot;


I am not sure what classifies as &quot;astronomical&quot; these days, but I had
225,000 miles on a virgin engine Mazda 626 with changing the oil every 5,000
miles.

I also had a Honda Accord which I used Mobil1 and changed the oil every
7,500 and then switched to Pennzoil and changed it every 5,000.  Did not
burn a drop of oil at all when I sold it with 140,000 on it with a virgin
engine...  Granted it had some other issues, gotta love those &quot;superior&quot;
Japanese cars...  Yah, right!  

My father is running a Acura Integra with 200,000 with Pennzoil every 5,000,
virgin engine does not burn a drop.

Father-in-law Cadillac Sedan DeVille 260,000 miles, 4.5 V8 I think, with oil
every 5,000 on virgin engine...  Got rear ended a little bit ago and totaled
the car.  Who says America cannot build a good car?

...  If the ding dang rod bearings would quit spinning on the T4 motors I
think they could go 200,000ish with loving care.  Great motors when treaded
right.
