Subject: Re: [T2] Need help insuring Westy in Texas

Rob,

You might try Farmers Insurance or the whoever you have your house? policy 
with.

Went thru the same thing when I was growing up in Texas and they made 
insurance madatory(waaaay back).  Farmers took care of me and I've been 
with them ever since.

Won't *ever* do business with Geico or Allstate.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey, y'all...
&gt; 
&gt; ...about 3 weeks ago I got a letter from my insurance carrier, Allstate, 
&gt; telling me that they weren't going to renew my policy with Allstate Property 
&gt; and Casualty &quot;because Property and Casualty has been losing money in Texas 
&gt; and we can't raise our rates because of the awful regulators&quot;, blah blah blah 
&gt;  - 
&gt; 
&gt; ...so, to show their appreciation, they're wanting to throw me and the rest 
&gt; of their &quot;valued customers&quot; into their (unregulated/high risk) county mutual, 
&gt; and, in my case, bend me over to the tune of a 43% rate increase on my two 
&gt; vehicles, with no more defensive driving discount...  and this after I've 
&gt; given them my business for 20+ years...  Both my partner and I are 50, with 
&gt; no accidents/violations on our records. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to find insurance with other carriers, and while I've gotten 
&gt; quotes on my '89 S-10 Blazer (significantly lower than Allstate), I'm having 
&gt; trouble getting quotes on our '76 T2 Westy, and I'm afraid if I can't insure 
&gt; both together I'll end up paying as much as I would pay Allstate due to not 
&gt; being able to take a multiple vehicle discount.   One agent told me yesterday 
&gt; that our Westy didn't qualify as a personal auto because it has a sink, 
&gt; stove, refrigerator, etc., but it also doesn't qualify as an RV because it 
&gt; doesn't have a permanently installed, plumbed toilet - she advised me to stay 
&gt; with Allstate and take the reaming.
&gt; 
&gt; Can any of you (preferably in Texas - we live in Austin) tell me how you have 
&gt; your Westies insured, and (again, preferably in Texas), can any of you refer 
&gt; me to a decent company that won't gouge me?
&gt; 
&gt; Rob Bollinger
&gt; Still (somewhat) hopeful in Austin
