Subject: Wiper Question

Is there any way to &quot;tighten&quot; a bus winshield wiper's clamping action to the
windshield.  One of mine is kind of weak.  I switched them, so the &quot;strong&quot;
one is on the drive's side, but the other wiper just doesn't spring very
hard on the windshield.

Can this be fixed or do I have to find another wiper?
