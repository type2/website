Subject: '77 Brake Overhaul
Date: Wed, 3 Mar 1999 16:02:28 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Wanted to comment really quickly as I'm about to do an end to end overhaul
on the brakes for the '77 Westy.  I've ordered all the main parts including
the German ATE rotors and drums (I guess German drums appear to be), brake
hoses, ATE pads, and rear shoes from Bus Depot.  I want to note how
exceptionally pleased I am with the quality of the stuff particularly the
German rubber lines.  Ron is selling these things for about 2/3 of what
anyone else lists what are probably Brazilian parts for.  He actually has
most of the Brazilian for $1 or $2 less but at about $40 for all new, all
German, soft lines it is LUDICROUS for anyone out there to be driving along
with cracked ugly 25+ year old hoses.  Brakes are important people, the '77
is the nicest Bus I ever saw and all its parts still look great but relying
on 20 year old hydraulic hose is foolish.  The prices on the rotors and
drums are comparable to anyone but these are after all definitely ATE.  I've
half considered a DOT5 upgrade to the brake fluid at this point as well and
was going to spring for a new master cylinder as I've gotten calipers and
wheel cylinders locally (Advanced Auto, $33, $10 respectively, lifetime
rebuilt and new Varga) but am too worried about possible damage to the
pressure regulator which is largely irreplaceable I surmise, so even though
this Bus sits too much she will continue to sit with the Castrol LMA.
Anyway as far as questions which is the point of all this, I'm wondering if
anyone knows someone who sells the stock pad backing plates, or if anyone
has used the stick on aluminum pads for sound deadening.  I'm also wondering
if anyone has considered stainless pistons, I'm thinking of pulling apart
the rebuilt calipers and turning out 4, 316SS replacements as the previous
failing of the Bus has been corroding pistons from sitting too long even
though it gets a fluid change yearly.  Anyway opinions or a source for the
backing plates appreciated.
