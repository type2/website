Subject: Re: Fw: AVP

&gt; &gt;I did not
&gt; &gt; witness the final steps of
&gt; &gt; engine dyno testing at the facility, so this must be
&gt; &gt; performed at another
&gt; &gt; location. It was apparent that my specific engine
&gt; &gt; had been tested, so I feel
&gt; &gt; confident that this must be the case. I did not ask.
&gt;
&gt; If you didn't see it and didn't ask....what makes you
&gt; believe it was actually being done?
&gt;
&gt; I don't mean to sound negative, but in truth, your's
&gt; is the only 'positive' testimonial for AVP that I've
&gt; heard in the 2+ years I've been on this list :-(
&gt;
I am not advertising for the guy, I just visited his shop to see where I had
spent 1200 of my hard earned dollars. I originally chose AVP for two
reasons, the reputation on THIS list and the advertisement in a VW magazine
claiming that they dyno tested all of their engines. I have so far had no
AVP problems with my engine. In fact the service that they have rendered me
so up to this point has been exceptional, and personal. They even got for me
(some) credit from GEX on the 15K rebuild the PO had installed. I was
curious about the Dyno thing, because before I purchased my engine I asked
Erin about it, and she made out to me like she did not know why they tested
the engines, except that they had purchased a dyno and she guessed that they
'just wanted to use it.' My visit was short, and I didn't ask about the
dyno. I do know that my engine arrived with clean oil inside, as if it had
been run and drained, and when I started it for the first time there was no
valve noise at all. In fact, if I had not gotten smart and tried to adjust
the valves, I would have not had to touch them at all.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe, after visiting his shop that he is a
&gt; &gt; competent rebuilder and
&gt; &gt; worthy of the money I spent on my engine.
&gt;
&gt; I dunno...considering the volume he must be doing, I
&gt; can't see how it could be possible that he does all of
&gt; the rebuilding himself. Not if he does all he says he
&gt; does, anyway.

It looked to me as if he does about two or three engines a day, and he has
his shop completely organized around this production. It looked like he does
mostly waterboxer engines.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I dunno...just my opinion (which means very little). I
&gt; hope you're right...there are *far* too few honest VW
&gt; rebuilders around!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Still, nice to hear something nice about AVP for a change.
