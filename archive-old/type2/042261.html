Hi Ryan,
I may be opening myself up to being flamed, but I can't help but ask.....
Why drive your bus so fast?
It appears that you enjoy it greatly.
Texas heat !?
Sitting out in front of your wheels right behind the VW emblem !?
Doing 75 mph to 85 mph !?

Those people in new junk cars drive fast for a reason.
They ain't got cool wheels.
You do.
Take care of 'em.
Slow down and enjoy the ride.
Let your bus enjoy the ride.
Once you're there, the best part of a bus trip is over !
