Subject: Re: [T2] Overhead Console (LCD-TV)

&gt;Audiovox no longer makes this model (AFAIK), but make a larger unit with 
&gt;more goodies. The new unit (IMHO) would still fit quite nicely and remain 
&gt;out-of-the-way.

Got a flier in the mail yesterday from www.partsexpress_dot_com and they have a 
good variety of these monitors for sale in the $150+ price range.

Prices are coming down b/c they had whole mobile DVD systems for less that 
the monitors were last year.

I'm thinking about buying an LCD monitor for the kitchen that will fold up 
under the cabinet. Would be equally nice in the bus but I don't expect alot 
of TV watching during trips as we are usually pretty tired at the end of 
the day.

Good luck.
