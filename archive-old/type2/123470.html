Subject: RE: [T2] Re: GEX Motors

Hey Volks,

Okay most of you have read my GEX situation with the engine. Did somebody 
say Transmission? How can I tell if my Tranny is stock or different? Is the 
GEX stamp on the transmission, too? It is an automatic 1977(NOV 1976). Where 
do I look?


Thanks,

Michael Knight
