Volks,

I am about to replace the training arms on the '73.  I have bought a new
set from Bus Boys with new ball joints pressed in.  I have done this job
before, and it is no joy :-(  Removing the steering knuckle is OK,
removing the sway bar is OK, as long as you have the correct tool[1], but
the upper arms are a metric bear[2] to get off.  I went looking in the
library for any improved techniques and saw Mike Gensler's excellent
article which basically detailed what I already knew :-(  Remove the bump
stop and whale away with a sledge hammer.  I have done it this way, but I
am not happy about it and figure there *has* to be a better way.  Any
suggestions???

[1] the correct tool for removing the clamp on the rubber of the sway bar
is the mongo sized vice grips that are built to grip 3&quot; pipe.  If you
compress the rubber a bit, that tapered clamp slides right off.  If you
don't it is a hellish experience!

[2]  a metric bear is 2.2 times as large as an english bear :-) It *is*
friday after all :-)
