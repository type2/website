Subject: Heat!

Hello all,

I've been following the heat threads recently and reading up on Bulley's
site about insulation and how the heat is supposed to be.

Today I decided to get the heat working well on my '79.  I was getting a
faint breath of heat but it still felt drafty inside the van and while I was
never really cold, I was never really warm either.

Today I went to the store and got some duct insulation.  I pulled all the
paper heat hoses under the van, and wrapped them with the insulation.  While
I had the hoses off, I adjusted both the flapper valves, one of which was
way off.  Then I noticed the pipe that connects to the left heat exchanger
was off a little bit, creating a leak where the two joined.  I had to do a
pull up of sorts on that to get it back in the right place.

I also noticed that one of my control cables is bent.  The cable that
controls the distribution box under the van and determines which vents the
heat comes out of is bent and the flaps in that box are as a result in the
closed position no matter what the position of the left red lever.  So if
anyone's got that cable and wants to get rid of it, let me know :-)

Put it all back together and...when the engine is idling and the heat is on,
I can actually hear the air rushing out of the vents!!!  As engine speed
increases the sound of the rush gets louder.  I've never heard that in any
air-cooled VW I've ever had.  There is a LOT of air coming out of the
footwell vents or defroster vents (depending on what's selected) and that
air is HOT.  I think once I get the control cable replaced the distribution
of the air will be a bit better but for right now it's warming up the
driver's area very very well.  I am amazed!

It's amazing how well the heat works when it's in proper working order.

But again, if anyone's got that cable, let me know :-)
