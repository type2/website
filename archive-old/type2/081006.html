Subject: Re:Carbon removal

Carbon is easily removed by soaking the parts in a product called 512M made
by the Brulin Corp.  It's an industrial detergant.  Once the part has soaked
for a day or two, just rinse it off.  Repeat as needed until all the carbon
is gone.  For info check out

I have no idea where you might get this.  The company I work for orders it
direct from Brulin in 5 gallon cans.
