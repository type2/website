Subject: Sump or Stick?

Hey all...

This be me, Gene, with my '81 Westy still without guages.....that is, I have the 
oil-temp. guage, but the dipstick sender they sent was for a bug....even though 
the VDO catalog said specifically for T4 engines....and the head-temp. guage and 
sender are still on backorder.  

Does anyone know of someone somewhere with a head-temp. setup in stock?

About the oil-temp. sender.....I was thinking that maybe I could carefully 
measure the differences between the two, and cut the guide tube short enough and 
straight enough so that I could use the beetle dipstick.....I don't mind having 
to lift the engine cover (remember..Vanagon!) to check the oil.  Any thoughts on 
this *scary* procedure?

And what about the differences between the 'stick sender and a sump-plate unit? 
 Has anyone determined what the actual difference is in degrees between the two? 
 Can guages be calibrated?  

Any advice would be well received!

Thanks, Gene
