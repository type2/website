So I'm looking into this '77 westy I've been asking y'all about and
getting great info on. I called my insurance agent and she said
nobody she deals with will insure it! I am in a very 'good' risk pool
really cheap rates, super clean record, married &amp; 28.  All I'm
looking for on the bus is liability. I told her it is an RV, since
that is how I'd register it, but it apparently doesn't qualify
since it doesn't have its own heat/a/c units &amp; enclosed toilet.
I asked if it were simply a van, would it work, she said no, since
you told me it is an RV, PLUS, no one wants to insure a 22 year old
van. ????.  I know, I need a new insurance agent, but they are so cheap
on my car. Has anybody had this problem?  Can somebody recommend a
good company that insures their bus?

Thanks kindly
Patrick
