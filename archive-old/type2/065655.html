Subject: Cockpit partition?

I have sometimes wondered the same thing - but to keep the cool in! Here
downunder there are a number of commercial couriers who have a curtain
behind the front portion of a vehicle so the driver can experience SOME
degree of cool from A/C.  These curtains are usually made of a
transparent ?PVC? material.  It is probably NOT PVC as it is clearer
than most common PVC.  It is slightly greasy from memory (when new) and
is about 2-4 mm thick.  Its weight means that it hangs well, although I
would imagine great care would be needed in mounting it.  (In my pop-top
Vanagon there would be no-where to hang it).

The curtains I have seen have two overlapped sections so the driver can
walk-through.  I suspect that although the material is clear, vision via
a rea-view mirror would not be all that good.


For what it is worth.

&gt; Has anyone designed a successful cockpit partition (you know to keep
&gt; the heat up front).  I have considered doing this but there are many
&gt; options. I suppose curtains would be easiest but you cant see out the
&gt; back window. What else is there? Brett
