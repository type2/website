Subject: Re: Uh, which wires to coil? 76won't sta

According to my 77 diagram, the black wire with a fuse is for the back up
lights, which work when ignition is on.  The hot black wire is activated by
your ignition key, going first to the blower relay and on to the coil (+)
terminal.  Another wire must go from the (+) terminal to 86c of the double
relay, being the means by which this ign. (+) tells the FI relay to close
and give power to the rest of the  FI system while engine is on.  It shows
black in the FI diagram.
   The green condensor wire should NOT be positive- it goes to the negative
terminal of the coil.   Of what is left,  another (-) wire must be the
pulse pickup going to the ECU #1 terminal (shows white in 77).   The
striped wire is likely the computetr analysis wire going to the multiprong connector.
