you are now a full fledged member of the masochists society of VW, from

&gt; 3. I will replace all rubber, including the fuel lines, however I really
&gt; think the fuel ring is tacky. Is there any experience with replacing all
&gt; this with stainless braided fuel lines, especially since the ring must
&gt; maintain 35 lb. continuous pressure  ?


I replaced the rubber parts with braided stainless but left the tubing
itself.  it is a PITA but I don't think it will ever leak.  the stuff is 
really awkward to work with, and the filiments will cut you something
fierce
&gt; 
&gt; 5. I cannot find the Probst fuel injection book for Bosch systems. Does
&gt; anyone have an extra copy they would like to sell ? Please pmail me if
&gt; so. Dirty/used is the best !

is this the VW troubleshooting book or a different one, if so I will send
you an (incomplete) photocopy of the book.  if it is a different book, I
will also ask for a copy

&gt; 6. The exhaust manifolds from the heads have lost the protective sleeve
&gt; which covered them. I recently thought I saw a thread about wrapping
&gt; these with a asbestos type material, but could not find the thread in
&gt; archives. Anybody know about this stuff ?

You will have a very hard time finding asbestos anything in the USA,
