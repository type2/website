Daniel, thanks for the offer. After several more hours of poking around with
the tester I have come to the conclusion that the switches are bad. When I
bypass the switch and jump the proper terminals in the switch boot the
lights work perfectly, so that must mean that there is power going to the
switch and continuity in the wiring downstream to the lights. I have ordered
the new switches and they'll be here in a couple of days.

thanks again,
Dave
