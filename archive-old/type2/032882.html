Subject: VW bus club in Holland

Just some factoids about buses in Holland:

In Holland (or more acurately: the kingdom of The Netherlands) a small group
of people founded the &quot;VW bus club of The Netherlands&quot;  in 1994.  Currently
the club has close to 500 members. Considering the fact that our country is
only 1/4 of the size of the state of Florida you can see that we've really
done well (but we have as many people living in this country as they have in
all of Autralia!). The club caters for all tastes as we have members with
buses ranging from the early sixties up to brand new ones. The majority
however consists of loafs from the mid and late seventies and Vanagons.
However I'm surprised to find how many fairly new Eurovan based Westies we
already have. These beasts cost a lot of money !! Expect to pay upwards from
$20,000 even for a 7 year old second hand one. Of course as campers go they
are very well laid out. Personaly I'm more in love with early bays. These
new things just don't have the Kharma (or was it Karma?). We also run our
own list-server (in Dutch) and currently have over 80 members subscribed to
this list.

I created the website for our club 2 years ago and we have had over 10000
visitors so far. Of course this site is in Dutch but it contains many
pictures. If you'd like to have a look feel free. The address is :

I just added a couple of new pages:

If you're interested in 'strange buses' you may want to look at the 'Hot
Dog' bus. http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/vwbusclub/Da_Ponte/Da_Ponte.htm

We also have a collection of pictures in 'Het fotoboek' (the photo-album).

Here we have pictures of splits, loafs, vanagons, Eurovans, and LT's (anyone
know what that is?).
