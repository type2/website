Subject: clutch job advice sought
Message-ID: &lt;372549DB.ACB624AC_at_home_dot_com&gt;

I have pulled my engine on my 68' because my clutch started making an
awful sound when depressed.
I think I need to replace the throwout mechanism because it seems to be
off center. The throwout bearing itself
has straight lines across it as though someone took a ruler and
scratched fine parallel lines all across it. The other
suspect component is the pressure plate which I haven't ever replaced.(
I've replaced the clutch disk twice.)
My pedal has always been abnormally hard to push down and I want to fix
it!!!!!!
As it stands I'm going to replace the whole system throwout lever,
bearing, and possibly put in a
diaphram clutch as opposed to the pressure plate. Any comments are
welcome.
