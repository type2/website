Wow!  This is just what I'd love to get - (really??).  Me a 30-year
wannabusser (since starting college when I saw &quot;Alice's Restaurant&quot;) in
mid-life crisis looking for the meaning of life by restoring life to a
venerable object such as a T-2.  Anyway, it's a long story and not my reason
for posting.

I live in Chicago (winter snow and road salt), so orphans such as this one
coming from outside the rust belt really appeal to me.  Besides the many
challenges a bus like this poses, one major challenge is figuring out how to
get it home, especially since I don't have my own means of towing 5000# even
a short distance, let alone 1000+ miles.  Commercial carriers or towing
companies?  Don't think so.  A friend recently blew the engine in his super
beetle 300 miles from home and the tow cost him over $400.  Rent a car
transporter?  U-Haul and Budget rent these, but you need at least one of
their 14-foot trucks to tow it with (not having my own), and adding up the
cost per mile they would charge it doesn't come cheaply.  What about
shipping via container?  Don't know anything about this, but tons material
move cross country every day.  Plan would be to secure bus in container,
container ships inter-modal to Chicago, container comes to my garage, bus
gets unpacked, container goes away.  Cost?  Damage?  Any better way of doing
this?  If not, I can accept the hard facts of bus-rescue life and can accept
them as just part of the cost of T-2 love.

TIA
