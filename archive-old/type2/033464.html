price point:  new slider and re-fabrication of the bottom 4&quot;
of the door itself, new rocker panel, and prime was $800 at
a body shop not afraid of rust.

fwiw, it took me a while to find such a shop as collision
repairs on insurance dollars makes a lot of shops as happy
as they want to be.

location for this was Cambridge, Mass., i.e., not a low-rent
district, etc.
