russell - 
typically the 2.0 engine will indeed have hydraulic lifters and thus solid (rather than hollow) push rods. however, this is not always true...i would suggest simply pulling off the valve cover and shining a light into the PRT to get a good look at the lifter...you can see the difference even when it's installed. also, you could put some pressure on the push rod and feel the lifter &quot;give&quot; a little if its hydraulic. so the correct valve adjustment, as you mentioned, is simply turn until the bolt touches the valve, then two more turns.  

in my limited experience w/exhaust sights and smells, i wonder if your gas and smoke is simply a rich mixture...does it burn your eyes when you hang out back there? as always, look for the *simple* explanation before making it more complicated. if your lifters are indeed hydraulic and the heads are in decent shape, i would be surprised to find the incomplete combustion you mentioned.

but i'm no expert...just my $0.02
