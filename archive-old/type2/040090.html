Subject: Oil Burner/Front Windshield replacement

I am looking at purchasing a '73 VW Bus.  A mechanic will look at it
early next week.  It is being purchased as a project.

The engine is a little bit less then perfect.  Its burning oil (blue
smoke), but the compression is good.  This would suggest that valves
are not sealing properly.  To repair then, one would need to remove
the head and send in for rebuild.  Is this assumption reasonable?
Should I be able to remove the head myself?

Also, the front windshield is cracked and will require replacement.
Is this a do-it-yourselfer's job?

Derek
