Subject: Santa came early, wearing a brown suit!

Merry Christmas everyone!

Well UPS is really doing a great job this year.  I had ordered all the
body metal replacements for my '74 Micro last Friday...British Columbia
to Florida in 3 days (free shipping too), wowee!!! I also purchased a
bunch of nice sale items from Harbor Freight to make the transplants go
smoother...now if I can just find some time :-)

I've been thinking more about this resto than any other I've done in the
past. Being a stock pervert for the past 15 years or so, and having
restored many early models...I'm beginning to think about a mixture of
stock and modern technology.  After all, it is a 74' model, the same as
me (gosh I'm getting old) and I could really do something special with
this bus.  I'm thinking of a resto which looks fresh out of Germany with
mucho state-of-the-art technology hidden deep within? 

What are some of your favorite electronic mods???  Keyless entry,
lighting, sound/entertainment systems...????
