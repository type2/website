Subject: Re: [T2] pic of seatbelt L-bracket?

[...]


&gt; I think that I requested such a PIC &amp; also want to see it


I found a pair of retractable belts with the bracket on them. I have already
installed the passenger side one on my 77 Westy. Except for drilling a 1/4''
hole for the guide pin, they were a bolt in swap. You may have trouble finding
more of them..... they came from a 411/412. They are part # 411 857 705D.
I will take pics of the left one and send them to whoever wants them tomorrow.
