Eddie,

Thank you for digging up the information on timing and TDC.  Since I no
longer have web access, and since various computer crashes have wiped out my
back-ups, I'm stuck when it comes to providing copies of such things.

I should point out that the information was specifically meant for Type I
engines, although the principle is the same for Type IV's.  Also, I believe
Clara reminded me that there is some small difference in the OD of VW
crankshaft pulleys  -- my numbers are only valid for a pulley of 7&quot; diameter.
