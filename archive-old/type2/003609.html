Hello All,

Mary Beth and I are off for 8 months of Bus Living and Travelling !!!!!!!!!
Yippee !!!!!!!!!

I managed to get a few pictures of Casper on the home page before we left.
Not much time to do same, but these will show the bus and some details of
the recent work performed, as well as the &quot;no holes&quot; methodology I used for
the amateur radio installation.
Here:

BTW,
While on the road, most of my ham radio communication will be done on 18
MHz, for those that can get up there and say hello to N5RP and XYL.
