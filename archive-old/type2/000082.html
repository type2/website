&lt;&lt; 
 I suspect that without them they would not move but not putting on the wires
 is an experiment I don't want to try with my or my clients engines.
  &gt;&gt;
I have been running my engine with the wire on the right side, no wire on the 
left ( that way when I bought it) for quite some time, and neither side 
leaks. Go figure. Not to say the wire isn't needed, and if I come across one 
for the left, I'll put it on. Just doesn't seem to make difference on mine... 
so far.      Jeff S.
