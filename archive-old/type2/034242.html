&gt;   My 77 westie has given me a not very nice Christmas

torque converter seals are avaliable from Ron (Bus Depot) for about $5 or
so, I replace mine whenever the engine is out.  (sort of like the throwout
bearing)

they are no harder to replace than a wheel seal.

&gt; nothing to do but tow her to the only mechanic I know
&gt; who still works on aircooled.
&gt;     I've got two options, according to my mechanic:
&gt;  1. replace the seal, and hope it went due to age
&gt; alone, not some other problem that caused high
&gt; pressure that might blow the new seal.  

because it was leaking slowly for a while I tend to doubt it is anything
else (try to find a torque convertor bearing too, if you find one let me
know)  it seems the most common failure is the oil pump, and it is a &quot;Not
worth the energy repair&quot; find another tranny. 

&gt; 2.  Convert the bus to a standard transmission from a

this is a VERY DIFFICULT project, the auto bus is missing a few components
that is required for the manual.  besides the tranny and clutch, and
flywheel, you will have to put in a clutch pedal and linkage, a shift
system and linkage, also the tranny mounts are different.  and the
accelerator system is different, AND if you have a fuel injected engine
the ECU is different.

&gt;    Has anyone seen a pattern on auto transmission
&gt; behavior in this regard?

fix the auto tranny, it has one big advantage over the manual, it
constantly monitors your power needs and adjusts the gears to the power
demands.  Thus it is next to impossible to lug or overrev the engine.
this helps increase the life of your engine by not overworking it (IMO)

&gt;    Has anyone done the conversion on a late bus? any
&gt; comments on problems and procedure would be most
&gt; helpfull as I decide what to do.

if your mechanic will do it for $1,000 and includes all the parts needed
including the ECU (1977 Manual-CU57X  auto - CU58X) this is $275 alone

&gt;   Searching the archives seemed to only turn up:
my opinion.
  if it is an automatic leave it an automatic
    if it is a Manual leave it a manual
