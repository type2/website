    I am rebuilding a set over carbs for my '73 bus. I am curious about
    what to use to clean them.

For those considering rebuilding carbs, an area that may require attention
is the throttle shaft bushings (bushings near the base of the carb
through which the shaft for the butterfly throttle plate controlled by the
accelerator cable passes).  Loose bushings can result in a vacuum leak. 
I recently sent a Solex 34 Pict 3 carb body to Rimco to be re-bushed. 
Rimco completed the work quickly, but I haven't yet installed the carb. 
Originally, the carb had a brass bushing on the drivers side and a plastic
piece on the passenger side.  Rimco installed brass bushings on both
sides.   I'll report on the results when I install the carb.  The charge was
$30 plus shipping ($8.00 in my case).  Rimco's address is in their
DB&amp;HVWs ad.
