Subject: 56/57 in Tallequah, OK

Hey, did anyone ever check into the '57 panel I reported on in Tallequah, OK
earlier this year? I seem to recall that someone was going to check into it,
but I don't remember hearing anything else about it. I ran across my notes
on this bus today. It really should be rescued. It was reported to me as a
'56, but it's really a '57 walkthru double door panel (VIN # 315427).
Relatively significant rust, but definitely not a crusher candidate. My
notes say: &quot;needs rockers and backdoor lid. Dash rusty, etc. Front and back
windows out. Doors not cut&quot; (like the Sundial Campers). I remember there was
a logo on the side...?a dry cleaner's I think?

If no one already has, I may call this guy and see if he'll sell...and for
how much. Not that I can afford it, but hey, maybe the kids would like a bus
for Christmas. ;) Joe
