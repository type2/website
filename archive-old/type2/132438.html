Subject: RE: [T2] VW's take on tires - Owner's manual and Bently specify
   these  tires.

George Lyle responded:

&gt; Close, but the maximum loads for a given load range are lower for the low
&gt; profile 195/75R14 tire.  Since load range C is only rated at 1435 pounds,
&gt; you'll need load range D in this size.

Nope. _Specifications_ for the '79's require a minimum of 1267 lbs., as I
have demonstrated. However, I feel more comfortable with half the gross axle
weight rather than 1/4 the gross vehicle weight, which would put me at 1433
lbs., still (barely)within the rating of the 195/75R14's.

&gt; Since the 195/75R14 tire is
&gt; smaller in diameter your engine will spin faster for a given speed,
&gt; something hardly needed in a bus!

Overall diameter varies from tire to tire, even within the same manufacturer
and model. That said, the overall diameter for the Bridgestone Deuller
195/75R14 is 25.7&quot;, the _same_ as Yokohama Y356's in 185R14's. The BS spin
811 revs/mile, and the Yoko's 808. What's that? Around a 0.37 % difference?
I suspect if you bought four matching tires, and you had the capability of
making the measurements, you'd find this much variance among them.

&gt; &gt; Nowhere in the owner's manual did I find any reference to
&gt; &gt; &quot;maximum load.&quot;

&gt; My '71 manual specifies a maximum load of 1520 pounds.

What ply design does it specify in the manual: radial or bias?
What is the gross vehicle weight listed in the manual?
GAWF? GAWR?

&gt;  It isn't likely you'll find LT tires in the
&gt; &gt; load range of C that do not meet the &quot;maximum load&quot; required of this
&gt; &gt; vehicle,
&gt;
&gt; Actually, since the maximum load varies with the size, the load range
&gt; alone is no guarantee of suitability.

Absolutely right. Always check the max weight rating before deciding on a
tire.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &quot;...The maximum load capacity... added to the weight of the
&gt; vehicle, must
&gt; &gt; never exceed the total load capacity of the four tires (marked on their
&gt; &gt; sidewalls.&quot;
&gt; &gt; For my '79 Kombi (the Kombi has the greatest GVW, not the
&gt; campmobile), that
&gt; &gt; works out to 5070 lbs. (ACK! Two and a half TONS?) divided by
&gt; four tires is
&gt; &gt; 1267.5 lbs.
&gt;
&gt; Be careful, the rear axle carries more than half the weight of the bus!
&gt; Note that the front pressure is constant at 30PSI regardless of load, but
&gt; the rear pressure can be as high as 44PSI, indicating that the rear
&gt; wheels are carrying significantly more load than the fronts.  If only 200
&gt; pounds of the evenly-distributed weight of 1267 pounds is shifted to the
&gt; back you end up with 1067 on the front wheels and 1467 pounds on the
&gt; rears, over the max load of the 195/75R14 load range C tire and
&gt; approaching the specified maximum load of the 185R14 load range C tire.

Right on about the uneven weight distribution, and this may have been the
thinking behind spec'ing the 1520 max load in '71, but these figures would
be the result of an overloaded axle by 101 lbs. I'm spec'd at a maximum of
2833lbs gross rear axle weight, 1433 each tire, and I will adhere to the
German engineers' specifications. I'd have to load ten 200 lb. people in my
van to approach capacity. The '71's must have different specs; the engines
are certainly lighter, as likely is the unladen weight. Can you confirm
this? More capacity available for payload increases the likelyhood of uneven
weight distribution.

&gt; German engineers don't tend to overspecify things like American engineers,
&gt; as they expect the vehicle's users to adhere to their recommendations.
&gt;
&gt; George

Absolutely, George. We're talking specifications here. The '71's are
apparently different than the '79's. I misspoke, not having had all the
reference material at hand. My apologies.

I'd like to hear from people who have different year owner's manuals. If I
can gather all the information, I'll put together one comprehensive post
compiling VW's tire specifications for the different years (I promise, it'll
be short!). P-mail me off list.
Please include the year and all the information from the WEIGHTS section of
the TECHNICAL DATA chapter in the owners manual, Unladen Weight through
Gross Axle Weight Rear for each model. English units are fine; no need to
include the metrics.

Thanks, All.
