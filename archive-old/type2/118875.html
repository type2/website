Subject: front nose section

Does any one know who makes front aftermarket nose sections - I expect that
some come from Brazil - but how bout Denmark?  Anyone know what gage metal VW
used on body panels in the past?  How bout today? How bout after market repair
panels?  I called Bus Depot and they tell me that the sections come from
California - what does that mean - made in CA? or ....

TIA
