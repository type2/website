I have a 1978 Riviera that needs some help.  I got it in August, and it stopped running in October :O(  
I will be able to afford repairs by later February, and I am willing to hand over cash to a shop/mechanic that will get it running again.  I have most of the service history.  

It was running well until the starter went.  I replaced it, and after I fired it up, the alternator light came on.  Great!  I fiddled with the wires, but couldn't really see any that I mis-connected.  I was told that the light could just be acting up (wrong!) and kept driving it until the battery died on me.  Now it is at my house and I need to have AAA tow it to a shop.

What I need is two new batteries (I can get those), an alternator, someone to install that (I have ZERO work space and no garage) and take a look at my electrical system to check for shorts/problems.  I would also like to get an overall evaluation on the engine/tranny if possible.  

In addition to that, I need 5 new tires and the back left wheel hub needs to be re-threaded b/c the wheel fell off while I was driving it (all 5 lugnuts came loose and the rim screwed up the threads- they'll probably need to be torched off b/c they're jammed on there pretty good now).

I also need to have a corner piece put on my exhaust (the current piece is rusted on- will need to be torched off).

...think you can help?  What am I looking at for the alternator work?  Also, I need a little body work done (rear, right panel by battery (and I need a new battery tray). 
Please let me know if you can reccomend someone.  My number is 503-944-3500 (work)  503-280-1980 (home)

Thanks,
Peter
