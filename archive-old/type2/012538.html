In my experience, those CVs don't come off when you
want them to.  Although heavy and bulky, I think
installing a half shaft on the road would be much more
do-able than trying to beat off a CV joint.  With my
two Westys, I know I would be lucky to get one out of
4 joints off on the road.  Add to this the spring
retainer stuborness and steel bearings that want to
fall out when you tilt the joint, and I think I would
be lucky to get it re-assembled at all on the road.
For me half shafts are the only way to go.

By the way, have you noticed a lot of sloppiness in
the joints of rebuilt half shafts?  I wonder how much
it would cost to get a half shaft with new CVs?  The
new CVs are so stiff they feel galled compared to a
well worn CV.
