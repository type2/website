Hey everyone,

I have a question that has probably been asked about a bazillion times, but 
here it goes. I have a 77 westy that has a webber progressive carb on it. It 
has a huge dead spot right off idle. If I don't pump the gas it will die. I 
know everyone hates these carbs, but i had one on my bug and it worked 
great(killed in fire of 1990). I also have a 74 westy parts bus that has a 
1700 engine with dual carbs(stock) on it. Should I tune the webber, swap for 
the duals, or try to sale/trade the 74 which runs and is almost complete(no 
it does not have a stool) for a set of dual webber 44's.  Any input would be 
highly appriecated.  All this gas pumping is driving me crazy.

                                                Thanks in advance,

                                                   Justin
