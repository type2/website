&gt;==================================

Sometimes they have used for half that. Thought that was of interest to
yuppie types. More for less is the thema. Takes research to pinch the last
thin dime, which takes time, which squanders the dime. I can tell you where
to look but I will never demand to accept my sence of values. That's why
you have to do your own reseach and decide for yourself. And I'm not
kiddin'. If you cruise the used book stores you can find a copy of ragged
Haynes for a few bucks. Don't waste your money on the Bible unless you want
the best value, over the long haul, in the interest of your retirement
portfolio and the kinders college fund.
