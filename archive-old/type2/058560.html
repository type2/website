Subject: no starty when engine hot

Pat,

What you are experiencing is a classic example of vapor-lock. In a
nutshell, your fuel is getting so hot, it's vaporizing IN THE FUEL
LINE. This is not a good thing, to put it mildly! The reason it is
seeping out is that as it vaporizes, it builds up pressure. The reason
it runs for a minute and dies is that you are using the fuel in the
float bowl, but the fuel pump can't pump vapor and the fuel is not
being replaced.

Is your fuel line touching any source of heat? Is it touching the
heat-riser under your intake manifold (assuming you don't have FI)? It
sounds overly simple, but this WILL cause what you are experiencing.
Is the fuel line under the bus too close to a heat source?

Fix this, no matter what it takes, as you might be facing an imminent
engine fire.

Also, get yourself an oil-temp gauge and install it. Otherwise, you
have no way of knowing how hot you are running. Don't go cheap here,
get a VDO. All told, you should be able to get everything for about
$50.00. Compare that to the cost of a new engine. If your engine is
running hot, it could also cause what you are experiencing. Vaporized
fuel and an overly hot motor is a DEADLY combination!!!

If the above scares you, it should. Fix it. Don't drive it 'til you do.

IMHO.
