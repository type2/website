Subject: Oil leak

Volks,
  My '78 westy is spraying oil from the right side all over the exhaust
manifold and heater box. This makes for a really nice smokescreen as I
drive. :-)  I haven't had the chance to really crawl up under and search
for the source, and it wasn't immediately apparent at a casual glance.
Should I be looking at anything *other* than a pushrod tube, or is that the
most probable culprit?

Thanks!
