Subject: Re: Three Scoop Question

Sorry about the delay y'all
The 3 scoop initiative was a success.  Engine temp dropped 15 degrees with 
corresponding drop in oil temp and rise in oil pressure.

I'm in the throes of installing remote cooler/fan setup, will run that then 
duct the 3rd scoop to the cooler.  Then I plan on adding a 4th scoop (When 
will the madness end?!) in the right side to complete the modifications.

The cooler install is linked off the scoop installation, found at 
http://members.xoom_dot_com/BurritoMan/scoop.html

Of course, I'll keep y'all apprised of how it works as we go (may need 
prompting)

Hey Uncle Dave, don't keep me in suspense amigo...How'd the three scoop mod
work? I'm thinking about doing something very similar to my ' 78 Westy( thou
I'll be ducking the cooler different from your set-up) So was it worth it or
what?
