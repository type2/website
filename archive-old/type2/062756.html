Subject: True Wheels?

I have some vibration in my '68 crewcab that I suspect might be caused by
the wheels being &quot;out of true&quot;.  When I put it up on jacks a couple weeks
ago and spun the front wheels, I could see as I watched the rim that it
wasn't out of round, but did move back and forth (from the driver's side to
the passenger's side - that axis).  The movement wasn't major, maybe a
sixteenth or eighth of an inch.  I'm going to check it and measure it this
weekend.

What kind of tolerances are there for wheels?  Can they be brought back
true?  Is it even a problem?
