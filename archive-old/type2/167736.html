Subject: Junk Buses in Pittsburgh, PA

Saw this on Craiglist:

http://pittsburgh.craigslist_dot_org/pts/376977139.html

Two &quot;junk&quot; buses in Pittsburgh, PA.  You now know as much as I do...

I may try to take a look at them in the next few days, but I'm not sure if 
I have time.

Also...I saw someone driving a bay-window Cargo van (i.e. no windows in 
the sides or sliding door) driving up Nobles Ln about 2 weeks ago, all of 
a half mile from my house.  I'd never seen a bay with solid walls instead 
of windows.

Cheers,
    Tom

ps  I'm not related to the owner of these buses in any way...
