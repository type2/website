&gt;From what I have seen, replacement plastic handles do not even hold up as 
well as the plastic originals. For the price(near $40), they should be 
something that should outlast the vehicle. I have been hunting around in 
junkyards( with some success) for 1940's- 1950's American car and truck door 
handles that fit on the shaft(yes, they were made of steel). The ones I have 
replaced are all still in service. I don't know exactly what fits, since most 
of the ones I found were in a mixing bowl full of handles, but it's something 
to hunt for.     ED
