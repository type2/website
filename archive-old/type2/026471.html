&gt;Without major modifications, (cutting and welding etc..) what motors 
&gt;can I put into my 1972 camper bus.  Currently of course it has the 
&gt;stock 1700 CC motor.  I plan to replace this or just rebuild it stronger 

All type IV cases were created equal and are all 100% interchangeable.  You
can take any type IV long block from a 72-78, bolt on your old intake,
flywheel/clutch, and exhaust and off you go.  I excluded 79 buses in that
last statement because they have 1-year only square exhaust ports on the
heads and would require the use of the 79 exhaust system as well.  

You can even take a motor from any year (70-76) Porsche 914-4 and bolt it in
as long as you use your old intake, flywheel/clutch, exhaust and sheetmetal,
but the oil filler and dipstick will be located differently.  You can
probably use any type IV motor from a VW type IV as well, but I don't have
any experience with them.

The intake systems are where the differences really start to add up.  The
original dual carbs that came with your bus will work, but will adversly
affect the power of any engine bigger than the stock 1700.  And if you want
to switch to FI from a late-model bus, in addition to needing ALL the FI
pieces (don't forget the ecu, fuel pump, relays, etc.), you'll have to swap
your gas tank so you have a return tube for the gas.

Best thing to do would be to figure out what you'd LIKE to do, then ask the
list what all would be involved with that specific application.
