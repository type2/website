Subject: Ticking/tapping on startup

Since late July my 81 Vanagon has been making this noise upon initial 
startup.  It sounds like a fainter version of that produced by a lifter 
that has collapsed, you know, when you let your bus sit for awhile and it 
makes a racket when you start it up but after the lifters pump themselves 
up the racket goes away.  Well, my motor is making this noise every time 
I start it up when the engine is cold.  

If the engine has been off only a few minutes, no noise.  Last night it 
was sitting for two hours, faint noise upon startup.  Yesterday morning 
after sitting overnight, louder noise upon starting.

The ticking/tapping noise goes away very fast as the van is driven and 
the motor heats up.  The van runs superbly otherwise.  Compression is 
between 130-137 in all cylinders, just tuned, and returned 20mpg on 
recent trip on a mixture of city streets, two lane, and four lane 
highways.  The motor idles well, accelerates smoothly, and runs happily 
all day.

If I had let the van sit for a month and I heard this noise for awhile 
after starting it, I wouldn't be concerned.  Just the lifters pumping up. 
 I am nervous because it happens so often these days.  Any suggestions 
about what might be going on here, the seriousness of the situation, and 
what action to take would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Tony
