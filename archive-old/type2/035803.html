Subject: Re: Rear Brake Drum on '68

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; My rear brake drum is not budging at all. Seems to be rusted on nice and
&gt; tight. No give at all. I'm having trouble getting info that relates to my
&gt; '68. Does anyone know of a way to rig up a puller for this drum or if a
&gt; rental place would really have a puller that would work on this? Any advice
&gt; is appreciated.

First, emergency brake off?  Adjusters backed off?  (don't laugh, lots of
pro mechanics have made these errors)

Next, now that the nut is removed give the end of the splines a good
bathing in penetrating oil.  Hit it several times over a couple of days.
Give it a few raps with a brass hammer around the &quot;snout&quot; each time.

Still stuck?  It's puller time!  You need to get a puller that attaches to
the drum via the wheel bolts.  Try the rental place.  Torque the thing
down firmly, keeping in mind that you are storing a lot of energy  in the
puller.  It might _fly_ off when it comes loose!  Still won't budge?
More penetrating oil, more tapping with the brass hammer with the puller
applying pressure.  If it's still stuck, you might try a torch (a big one,
not propane) applied to the snout of the drum to heat up the metal.

Ultimately, you might end up cutting the drum off of the splines.  Let's
not think about that.
