&gt; I have a 71 Westy that runs hot.  It has the stock DP 1600 with oil bath air
&gt; intake.  When I shut the engine off after driving it, the tin around the
&gt; engine is very hot.  Is it supposed to be this hot?  What should I check out

Bryan, that's normal: all engines get hot after you shut them off and the
fans stops. Instead you may want to pull the oil dipstick *immediately*
after you shut off the engine and see if you can hold it with your bare
hands. If it's too hot to hold, then you *may* have a problem, otherwise
don't worry.

&gt; first?  Should I replace the oil bath setup with a paper element?

No. The oil bath setup is such a clever system, I don't understand why it
got replaced with paper filters, which are more costly, no more effective,
and a hindrance to air flow. Anyone?
