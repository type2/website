&gt;Rik, what is the filter sleeve in the gas tank? Does the nut on the bottom
&gt;screw right out, with a scavenge screen there to clean?

Yes.  Most likely, the screen is either rotted away, or is completely gunked up
for the bottom two inches, or so.  Mine was like this--that's how I could &quot;run
out of gas&quot; with a couple of gallons still in the tank.  I have never 
encountered
one that was in any kind of condition to clean.  You want to get the screen
and the washer/gasket thing that goes with it (but must be purchased 
separately).
Buy a couple of sets, they're cheap.  Get a 25 foot roll of 5mm hose while 
you're at it.
You WILL use it all up in a few years--I just did, and must order another 
one.  Bus Depot
should have all the stuff.  Although some argue against it, I strongly 
suggest putting
hose clamps on all fuel line connections (this is for carbs.--I have no 
knowledge of
Fuel Injection requirements).  This also might be a good time to safety 
wire the fuel
line connections to fuel pumps and carbs.  There is an excellent article 
about this
in the Type2 Library.

You should really consider cleaning and lining the tank, the next time you have
the engine out (get the stuff on hand before hand).  POR-15 makes a kit, that
has been favorably reviewed on the List.
