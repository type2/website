Subject: Re: [T2] Re: '72 distributor in a '68

 &gt; I'd like to throw a curveball at this conversation. I have a '71 with an
 &gt; 1898cc stroker with Kadrons and a 009. I'm very disappointed with the 009
 &gt; you've got me thinking about the SVDA. But what's the best way to add in a
 &gt; vacuum port with the Kadrons on there? There's a T leading from the brake
 &gt; booster to the vacuum ports on the carb manifolds. So is this as simple as
 &gt; adding another small T for the distributor? Are there good and bad places
 &gt; to do that?

IIRC there was a description and pictures on www.theshoptalkforums_dot_com of 
where to drill the hole for the dizzy vacuum port.

Cheers,

Martin Strandgard
