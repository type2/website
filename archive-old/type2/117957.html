Subject: Re: [T2] Rear Wheel Bearing Job

&gt;Did you have trouble with the circlip? I'd be interested to know what tool
&gt;you use and where you got it from...


Hi Richard,

I used a standard pair of circlip pliers, and it took me a couple of tires 
to get the circlip out.  I found that sliding a feeler gauge (any size but 
the hallowed .006&quot;) between the bearing and the circlip was just enough get 
the circlip out of its groove.  Once it was out, I grabbed the circlip again 
(and with it out 1/16&quot;, I was able to get a better grip on it) and pulled it 
out once and for all.  Getting it back in was a breeze.

If you're doing your rear wheel bearings or are about to, I'd recomment 
spending the $15 I did for a pair of circlip pliers.  The big circlip WILL 
probably NOT come out without them, and I found them to have paid for 
themselves in their use on other circlips elsewhere on the Bus.  They are 
available at finer hardware stores everywhere.

Good luck!
