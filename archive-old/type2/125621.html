Subject: Replaced transaxle

I spent the entire weekend replacing the trans.  Shift travel is 
reduced by half.  It is much quieter now.

It still pops out of fourth gear!  What is wrong here?   I don't think 
it is the trans.  Could it be the linkage?  Is there an adjustment I 
can make?  It doesn't pop out of any of the other gears (I don't know 
for sure about reverse).

Chris
