Subject: Re: [T2] big-o 1/2 inch breaker bar

My Harbor Freight $39 (may have been on sale) 3/4&quot; socket set has worked 
very well.  No complaints even when I've used very large &quot;Helper Bars&quot; 
with no bending of the bar or cracking of sockets.

I also bought their 3/4&quot; drive 600 ft lb clicker torque wrench. works 
very well, but a hell of a big toy to store.

&gt;&gt;Can anyone on the list
&gt;&gt;recommend a 1/2 drive breaker bar or slider bar that happily takes
&gt;&gt;300+ ftlbs of torque. Sears is not an option, impact wrench is not
&gt;&gt;preffered.  Looks like everyone wants to sell those weak &quot;flex bars&quot;.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I can recommend a 3/4 inch drive slide bar and socket.  1/2 inch is
&gt;just too small for a gland nut.  Mine came from Sears, but they aren't
&gt;uncommon from any tool supplier.
