Subject: RE: [T2] CHT Temps

I just telephoned Westach regarding this gauge
http://www.aircraftspruce_dot_com/catalog/inpages/westcht.php since it is
advertised for use in certified aircraft. While it has no cold junction
compensation, the manufacturer states that it is calibrated at 75 degrees F,
and the compensation is linear (i.e., one degree in ambient temperature = 1
degree in CHT). Pretty inexpensive, and extra senders are readily available.
The biggest problem you'll run in to with this type of gauge in a VW van is
the length of the cable; anything over ten feet requires recalibration.

&gt; Except those don't mention any sort of cold junction compensation which is
&gt; what's needed to stabilize the readings.
