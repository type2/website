Subject: RE: [T2] Pleasur-Lift Air Shocks?

Good--your not trying to supplement what isn't there in the first place.

The only thing bad I can tell you is that the AC Delco air shocks have
an exposed air bag and will and can catch a wild stone or rock and will
punture.
The shock unit isn't separate from the air chamber.
You jack them up--you get a rock hard ride.
Yhis is just the way that they are made.

However, the Gabriel Air Shicks have a totally independant shock unit,
which means wherever or how much air you put in them the shock unit is
totally separate from the air bags--you still have a shock absorber
regardless of how high you jack the vehicle up. 

This is a bonus for a good ride.
