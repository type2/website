In twenty years times we'll be scouring the country and crowing over &quot;FINDS&quot;
.....-NOS Brazilian and MEX parts (Still in original packaging). 
Hopefully by then we'll have time travel and then where will we be? ,
EVERYONE will be driving the car he wanted but ....brand-new . Just pop into
that time machine and its 1957 again, .........(something to consider for
all of you who are in the midst of a totally stock rebuild and hunting for
that hard-to-find original made-in-wolfsburg-bus-only left-hand-thread
cadmium not chrome-plated panel-screw).
 
	&gt; and then where will we be?
&gt; so, again, how much longer do we have?
