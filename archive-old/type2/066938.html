Subject: dream trip

In my one and only lovely 1978 beauty I would travel at the recommended 58
mph through the following areas, in any order and I don't care what's in
between:

Western Canada
Northern Minnesota
West Virginia
the Northwest

Theses are all places I've never been before and have been wanting to go
for a while.  Of course I eventually want to go EVERYWHERE in my bus, but
for now these areas are my priorities.  Can't wait until I don't need to
work during the summers to make money for school- maybe summer after next
I'll treat myself to a nice, long, roadtrip like I could afford in high
school.

I would take with me an apple, a banana... haha?  But really, my boyfriend
and our camping supplies (since I don't have a camper) are the only
necesseties.  Oh, now you've got me dreaming and I have papers to write!!!
