&gt;The third option is what I did in my C*evy pickup for camping.  the second

&gt;fabbed bracket and a longer belt, and looks like it's factory installed.)

&gt;the cost of a rebuilt alternator was actually lower than the whizbang

&gt;This would be tough with a VW, but it isn't impossible.

I saw this done back in 1964 on a VW.
My friend (K9OVK) installed a Leece Neville 12 VDC alternator to separately 
power a ham radio transceiver installation, and it worked perfect.

Another guy (W2DMK) did the same thing in a Karmann Ghia, and I saw this in 
Orlando, FL when I summered down there in 1966.

So, as Geo says, it can be done, but as I recall, it was a little tight 
under the bonnet with that 2nd alternator installed back there.
