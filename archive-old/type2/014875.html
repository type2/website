Subject: fixing e-break
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

Im surprised this hasent come up, as ive never seen a bus with a working 
e-brake. But last weekend I said hey, ive got time, lets tackle that ebreak. 
The cable and everything came out with relatively no problem, but i cant seam 
to ge to be able to take the guide tube on the cable out of the backing plate 
for the drumbs. The new one looks like it just might slip out, but when i 
look at the old one, it loos like it might be cliped in, i dont want to have 
to the backing plate too, although as rusty as everything is i probably 
should..... Anyone dont this or have any tips?
