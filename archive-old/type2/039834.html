Subject: LiMBO at Carlisle

To all those planning to attend the Carlisle (PA) Import Show next
weekend, May 19-21: LiMBO will be there! We didn't get a tent this
year because the Fairgrounds wanted a $145 deposit up front. We easily
had the necessary 20 vehicles for the free tent last year, but not
enough registered as LiMBO members--so no free tent this time around.
We also expected a lower turnout this year, because Westies in the
Woods in Branchville NJ is the same weekend. (Believe me, these are
both excellent events. The conflicting dates couldn't be avoided. The
only reason I chose Carlisle is because dogs aren't allowed at the
state park in Branchville.) As a result of not having a club tent
we're going to be way in back with the other German marques. Just look
for a bus and park next to it! On the plus side, we're right next to
the showers and restrooms. I hope every can make it to one, or better
yet both of these fine venues.
