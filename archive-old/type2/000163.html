    Hello Everyone, upon close examination of my case I found small gouges in 
the lifting bores.  Does this mean my case is junk? I found no reference to 
this situation in Bentley or Muir.  BTW, in shopping for connecting rods the 
best price I found was at MOFOCO ($44).  Is this place reputable? Thanks For 
Reading, Pete
