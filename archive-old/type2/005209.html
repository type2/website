X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Headlights sounds like a bad earth connection.  You know it as 'ground' I
believe.  You need a meter or trial and error time to test relevant 'ground'
connections.  Power is being fed to the lamps from the brake circuit due to
a poor connection somewhere.  You must have seen vans with both rear
indicators suddenly glowing instead of just the one when the brakes are
applied coming up to corners, = Bad earth problem.
Can't help too much with your other queries  but popping the valve cover off
should give a clue on
hydraulicor non-hydraulic valves.  Compare it to pictures in the books.
I have no idea what an electric heater is doing in the engine bay.  Must be
brass monkey weather where you live.  Fuse blowing is incorrect rating,
motor taking too much current due to short or sticking perhaps.  Need to see
that really.
Wires will short out when the insulation is worn away.  Normally due to
inappropriate routing leading to chafing on a metal fixing.  Route cables
properly and use grommets when they pass through a panel.
Happy bussing.  Not the old English meaning of course which is entirely
inappropriate.  But there again...............

Sorry, it's been a long day.  Regards, Robert.

&gt; We recently noticed that our 1978 Bus (pop top, chassis no. 2382074081, 2
&gt; litre engine CJ109108, Westfalia interior SO 73/7) has a novel feature -
the
&gt; headlights come on as well as the brake lights when we apply the brakes.
&gt; I've been driving with the headlights on permanently so that people don't
&gt; think I am signalling to them all the time. Any ideas what I should look
for
&gt; when I go to fix it?
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, is there any way I can tell if I have hydraulic valves without
&gt; opening up the engine? I've read that they were introduced in the 1978
&gt; models but don't know if my bus has the original engine.
&gt;
&gt; And finally, the electric heater fan in the engine compartment has blown a
&gt; fuse twice. Does anyone have any experience where wires commonly rub bare
&gt; and short?
&gt;
&gt; Although I have a Haynes Manual and the John Muir books I'm new to this
and
&gt; any advice would be much appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
