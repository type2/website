Subject: Octane -- vs. RON

Jim,
   Do you have any idea how RON measures up to Octane. On the inside of the
fuel door it says to use a minimum of 91 RON. I may not have spelled that
correctly, but it for sure doesn't say octane. If RON is metric what is the
standard equivalent. This is a 65 Bus by the way. I generally use premium
unleaded fuel which around here is 91 or 92 octane depending where you get
it. Some stations have 93, but I haven't found too many of those.

Rick
