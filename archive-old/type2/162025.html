Subject: cancer

I started hand sanding the front of the vand today (77 riviera) and  
noticed lots of cancer and quarter sized holes near the windshield.   
Looks like I'm in for a lot of resto work for the rest of the  
winter.  Are there shops that carry replacement sheet metal, or am I  
better off just cutting off the front and replacing it all at once?

-Gary
