Subject: wow! what a difference the SVDA dizzy makes!

  Okay, so I was a little sceptical to all the response about leaving the 009's for the type 1 crowd.  Could it make that much of a difference for in city travel?  YES IT CAN!  I am truely amazed at the extra low end power and I am now making since I replaced the 009 with a 021-905-205P dizzy.

  This is on a duel carb (dellorto) 2.0 hyd. in a '72 westy.  With the 228mm clutch using an 091 bell housing on the 022 Tranny.  because of the tranny gears I don't have the top end you 091 guys have but I don't have a problem going up hills in 4th!

  Thanks for all the advice over the last few months......

 

Paul
