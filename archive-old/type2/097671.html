Subject: Dizzy from the Funk!

The recent conversation about .009 vs. vacuum made me think.  Funky ('71
camper 1600dp) has a .009 in him now.  Beetle Bug (our '71 Super Vert, also
1600dp) has her stock vacuum advance dizzy.  She's going to be parked for the
winter and (hopefully) he'll be on the road.  Do you think I'd be better off
with the vac. adv. in Funky?  How would I go about doing this?  I assume I'd
just have to match both up to TDC, yank, and swap.  (Keep in mind, this is
only if I get Funky's brakes fixed... see last post...)  Is there anything
else I'd have to do?

(I think the hardest part of this procedure would be convincing my wife to let
me take her baby's dizzy!  She has a pretty strict &quot;no raping Beetle Bug for
parts!&quot; policy.)

Have a good one,
Eric and Funky
