&gt; Ya know, i might have read the sticker on the door wrong, but i feel like
&gt; thats right.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody close to a 1974 kombi - just a bus, not the camper?
&gt;
&gt; Check the door sticker for the weight - GAWR or something like that.

Nope, the GVWR listed on the door sticker is not the weight of the
vehicle -- it is the maximum ALLOWABLE weight including passengers, gear,
etc.  So if the sticker says GVWR 4900 lbs then it means &quot;4900 lbs is the
maximum load for this vehicle, including the weight of the vehicle itself.&quot;

You take the GVWR minus the true weight to determine how much more gear you
can load up.  Of course, who knows the true weight of their Bus? :-)

The actual weight may be 3500-4000 lbs or so depending on the model and how
much crap you regularly carry around :-)
