&gt; the rear of the trans. (No removeable rear panel like 68-71).

Good question Al,
It's been a while since I've assisted with removing the engine from a
Bus as opposed to a Vanagon and I think last time I helped we removed
the engine and transmission.  So I don't know the answer to your
question.

If you just want to remove the engine in a Vanagon, though, there is a
nice trick you can do.  The Vanagon front tranny mount is hinged.  If
you remove the shift rod and possibly ground strap and loosen the bolt
through the center of the front tranny mount, the rear of the tranny can
be raised and lowered using the front mount as a pivot point.  Make it a
little easier to get the engine back in, or out for that matter.

In the Vanagon you can also remove the transmission without removing the
engine (so says Haynes, though I've never tried it).  

I love the removable rear apron in the '71 and earlier Buses.  What a
great idea! :-)
