Subject: Re: [T2] emergency flasher

Hi,

My main man from the Netherlands makes a good point! As I recall my 
69 and 72s did flash the green on in cluster with the key out. It is 
either a 1968 thing or something is not wired correctly. I have 
unwired and correctly rewired everything under the dash and even 
replaced the gauge cluster with one from another 68.

On a side note,with my 67,68 and 69 buses, the headlights would could 
be turned on with out the keys in the run position. On my 72s the 
only the parking (city lights ) operated.

PS, Vincent, why don't you fly over for EveryBus next year. We will 
put you up in style!

Thanks
Chris
