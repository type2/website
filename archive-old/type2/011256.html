Greetings Everyone.

Thank's for all the tips about what to take on my VW trip. I am glad to report that I needed none of it (except a rag to keep an eye on the dip stick).

Anyways, the bus got us there and home with no major problems at all, just 2 concerns.

1. It sounds a little like a valve is ticking, so I'm gonna change oil and do the valve thing.

2. Three times on my 2 hour trip home when getting off the Interstate, I pressed my clutch all the way in to ride the momentum a little and let the bus slow itself down and as soon as I depressed the clutch the engine quit. It was like it would not idle or something. No sputtering, no weird noises or anything, it just quit. We had all the window down, so at idling speed I did not even really hear the engine quit, I just saw the OIL and ALT gauge come on and noticed that the brakes felt a lot different. 2 of those times the engine was difficult to start back up, but sounded just fine when the engine started and took us the rest of the way home.

The bus can sit and idle all day long and it sounds great, I have never had a problem with it doing this, but this is my first trip and I have not driven it excessivly so I was wondering if maybe it was due to a warm or hot engine?

I am going to change oil and do the valve thing before my next trip and I was also thinking of putting on a temperature guage at that point as well...I'll check type2 for info on that.

Thanks,
