Use gaskets.  You're just begging for a vacuum leak.

&gt;First, I am using AVP heads I bought through
&gt;busdepot_dot_com(looks great and arrived early). I have
&gt;been told by a local VW shop that the most recent
&gt;specs call for the head to be installed without a
&gt;gasket (i.e. metal to metal). This runs contrary to
&gt;what I know about engines but hey I am open minded. 
&gt;Any advise?
