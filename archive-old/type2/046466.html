Hi Mark,

I have to agree with you on how nice an index would be.  Finding related
information across several chapters is tough.  I basically have no memory.  It
is usually a new experience, again, as I check all possible locations relating
to a technical topic I refer to the list by location in Bentley.  I just look at
it as an easter egg hunt.

As a member of the &quot;us simpletons&quot; club, I have to break things down to their
basic design and theory to feel I have some knowledge and understanding, then
build it up from there with experience.
