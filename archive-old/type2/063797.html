Subject: t-shirts..

Volks,

&gt; So, alas, I don't have any extras. I couldn't even afford to get
&gt; myself one from the last batch. However, I might be able to do another batch
&gt;sometime

Maybe we should at least spring for a t-shirt to the one who's gonna 
go through all this effort.....

What'll you say?
