Also check out marine suppliers that cater to commercial fishermen and boatbuilders, or peruse the ads in 'National Fisherman' and similar publications.

There are lots of companies on the coasts that custom build plastic or welded aluminum tanks.  You can have whatever plumbing, fittings, internal baffling, etc. you want.  

Besides commercial stuff, they do plenty of business with pleasure boaters that want added fuel storage.  Those projects often require all sorts of peculiar shapes to fit into available spaces below decks.

FWIW...
-----------------------------------------

&gt;&gt; I wonder with all this talk about gas tank problems if it's possible to
&gt;&gt; make a plastic version (like some modern vehicles) of our old gas
&gt;&gt; tanks.  It would seem you could make a mold from an existing tank and
&gt;&gt;make a copy of it and that would cure the problems...(just dreaming)...
----------
&gt;Well, boat folks have tanks in all sorts of sizes and shapes.  Check out:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.westmarine_dot_com
&gt;
&gt;Click on Engine Systems and then Fuel Tanks.  It will yield dozens of
&gt;different plastic tanks, one of which might fit the tank space of a bus.
