Subject: Re: [T2] re-establishing EGR in my FI 

I have the linkage.
However, if that washer is loose, then you lost the lock nut. And more than
likely the rubber boot on the other end is history too. That valve is a paper
weight. It is now history.
When it is working correctly, the valve only lets exhaust flow thru it in the
middle of its travel. It is closed at each end of its stops.

&gt; now i am ready to pile on the fuel injection onto the engine along with
&gt; clean EGR parts. however i have two questions as i go along: regarding the
&gt; EGR valve, when i found it encased with trapped carbon, i found what
&gt; appears to be something like a thick counter-sunk washer on the end of a
&gt; threaded item. not sure what it does or how it works, and i wonder since it
&gt; fits in loosly do i simply lay it on the threads and button it up...? any
&gt; explanation on how this works and correct installation is much appreciated.
&gt; second, i am missing the linkage fron the EGR to the throttle valve. i
&gt; suppose once the connector pipe was plugged with silicone the linkage was
&gt; tossed. does a listee have a spare.   - steve
