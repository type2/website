Subject: Re: '67 color schemes

Has anyone compiled a list of factory offered paint schemes for a '67 bus?

I'm also interested in info on seat covers.  I have catalogues from the 
common parts places (RMMW, WCM and a few others I can't think of...) and 
have only noticed one-color vinyl covers.  My bus has seat covers of 
fabric and vinyl, and the fabric portion has a striped pattern rather than 
a solid color.  The panels aren't one color either, and they also have 
aluminum trim.  None of the advertised replacement panels I've seen are that 
fancy.  Does anyone know of another source?

sounds like you have either a standard or a deluxe microbus.

the stock factory colours were

for blue and white deluxes - blue and white interior

for red and white deluxes-  the mesh platinum interior (a kind of coppery
mesh colour)

for standard micros - mesh gray, aka salt and pepper

I know of no sources for decent repros.  I have seen seats recovered in
material very similar the mesh grey.   The bit you sit on is the salt and
pepper, the bit round the edge is grey.    

mesh grey panels are the easiest to for used, as they were used on may buses.
 Unfortunately, the seat material shreds, so I would go to  a fabric store
with a swatch and look for something close.
