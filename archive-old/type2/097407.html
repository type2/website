Subject: Bus Sightings

Just saw a Splitwindow Bus in a Wal-Mart commercial.  It features 3 young
girls clothes shopping.  You get a view of the front, right side, and later
they're driving it, view from inside.

Also, if you have Hecht's in your local Mall. Next time go in and check the
pictures in the Young Peoples department.  They're in the back of what looks
like a 23 Window.
