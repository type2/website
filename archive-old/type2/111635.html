Subject: cooling deflectors question

My cooling system is complete with everything including and an operational thermostat BUT I am missing the little one way cooling flaps at the bottom of the fan housing.  Not the air deflector flaps on the top of the engine but the ones that are at the bottom of the fan housing where it mates  up with the heat exchangers on both the passanger and driver side.  
Tell me, how important are those and what are their purpose?
 
It appears that overtime the vibrations at that point have  worn away the 'ears' that the flaps would hinge on, so if they are really important I will have to swap out fan housings.
 
Thanks,
Pablo
