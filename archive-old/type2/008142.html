I did a little research today on the MB spare after a few technical 
questions were raised.
The space saver spare is only used on the SLK230. [in the USA] I took 
one out of a brand new one and here's what is on it: manufactured by 
Vredestein in Holland. Temp use only. Max 50 mph. size 165-15. Load 
range D. Max load 1280 lbs. _at_ 40 psi.
The curb weight of a SLK w/auto trans is 3033 lbs. The factory new tires 
are max load 1356 lbs.
A lot less then my 77 deluxe Westy which weighs 3820 lbs. without me in 
it!
Then I looked in the 75 Westy owners manual. [they came with space saver 
spares] On pages 12 + 13 there is info about them. Max pressure 32 psi. 
Max speed 50 mph. Max load 1500 lbs.
The MB space saver is 220 lbs. less load bearing. Will it work as a 
spare? I don't know except it will bolt on to a bus. The MB part # is 
170 400 01 00. Before anyone runs out and orders one... be warned: list 
price is $372.00 USD!!!
