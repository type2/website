Subject: Re: [T2] RUST PROTECTION

this is an interesting product.  the problem that i have is that they talk
about all their testing but don't provide any test results or &quot;cut&quot;
sheets.  for example if you walk into sherwin williams industrial store
and ask for a specification sheet on any of their products you will get a
sheet with how many hours the coating stayed intact in the salt spray
chamber.  it seems that these guys did the testing but aren't willing to
provide the data on their web page.  they are only providing testimonials
while playing up their &quot;secret&quot; test results.  if any one manages to get
their test results i would be very interested in seeing them.
