Greg,

This is a good idea, but it doesn't quite do the psychological work I 
need it to do, which is to have &quot;one foot in&quot; Maine.

Also, it's more complicated than I originally stated. In a couple 
years' time I hope to have my baywindow in Maine and a Vanagon Westy in 
Flagstaff, Arizona, until I can get myself wrenched free of entailments 
in San Diego.

In the long run, it would be no more expensive than having a boat (or 
two).
