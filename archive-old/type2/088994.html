Subject: Re: [T2] John Brown's Buses

Hi Bob,
&gt; &gt; All MD,VA, WV, DC Metro, and travelers are invited to John Brown's Buses
on
&gt; &gt; October 18-20 at the KOA in historic Harpers Ferry.  It should be
beautiful
&gt;
&gt; where is that located, up near the top of the hill behind Harpers Ferry on
&gt; 340????
When you cross both rivers, it's on the left at the light.  The KOA is next
to The Park.
.

  maybe a carabus up
&gt; to the &quot;Hilltop House&quot; for Sunday brunch buffet, one of the most beautiful
&gt; spots in Harpers Ferry the dining room sits right on the bluff overlooking
&gt; the river.

From what I hear the food has gone down hill ;0(

&gt; also the cemetary on the top of the hill, problem though is that the
&gt; National park service no longer allows parking in Harpers Ferry they have
&gt; a shuttle bus from a remote parking lot, so no photos of our buses in
&gt; downtown anymore.

My house is one block from the cemetary.  My neighbors are the Park Offices
and Superentendant, I think we might be able to get a photo shoot of the
buses surrounding the armory!
&gt;
Hope to see you there Bob and as many others that can make it!
