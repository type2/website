You might look in the yellow pages under 'Alternators &amp; Generators -
Automotive Repairing&quot; and find a shop that specializes in alternator and
battery repair. I have found these shops to be well worth the money for
starting/charging/electrical problems because they have the test
equipment needed to quickly diagnose these kinds of problems.
