Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel cut off

Hi Chris, I finally dug out the info on the solenoid. The brand is Airod,
have a look at the link of a local supplier
http://www.medauto_dot_com.au/main_files/solenoidvalves.htm
I paid A$40 for model S26, so that should be ~$20 for you.
It also came with two fittings to adapt the 1/8&quot;NPT to a hose end.
I've had it on for about 2 months and ~6000Mi with no problems except the
pressure build up.

Just a note on this, after the last couple of long runs I've done I left
solenoid turned on for a few minutes and NO pressure build up.
By the way, if you have FI, I though your fuel system should be designed to
handle much more pressure than the 3-4psi put out by the dual carb fuel
pumps. So I thought they would suffer less fuel leaking problems than the
carb models??
And besides, how's your Corvair conversion coming along?
Good luck!!
Richard

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Just offering some advice.
&gt; &gt;I have installed a solenoid cut off in the fuel line straight after the
tank
&gt; &gt;outlet on my bus ('77 2L type 4 dual carb) as well as a fuel pressure
gauge.
&gt; &gt;What I have noticed when running the pressure is ~3.5psi, but when I turn
it
&gt; &gt;off the pressure has risen to as high as 12psi. (it takes ~3 to 5min. to
&gt; &gt;drop down to zero)
&gt; &gt;I'm assuming when turned off, the heat from the motor heats the fuel in
the
&gt; &gt;line which is locked between the solenoid and the carb needle valve
causing
&gt; &gt;the high pressure. What this now does is make it MUCH more likely to push
a
&gt; &gt;hose off, or burst an old line. So just beware. I'm now wondering how to
&gt; &gt;relive this pressure!!
&gt;
&gt; What was the source or brand of the solenoid valve. That is on my to do
&gt; list. I have some info saved up but I'm always looking for more.
&gt;
&gt; Thank You!
