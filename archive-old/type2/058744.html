Rami,
Unless your bus has been modified, the 120 V outlet is connected to the
'shore' plug on the outside of your vehicle. This only works when your
vehicle is plugged into 120 V power. 

You can add an inverter of your own to get 120 V from your 12 V battery
(300W continuous output for $60 at Wal-mart).
