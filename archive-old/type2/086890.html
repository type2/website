&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 	For doing some body work on the bus I'm getting set up with a MIG.
&gt; Do y'all have any recommendations in brands/model of auto darkening
&gt; helmets?

love mine, will have to go out to the garage to see the brand though,
there is one that doesn't even need batteries it is charged by the welding
arc

&gt; Recommendations on wire choices, flux coated preferably.

use plain wire and mixed gas.
