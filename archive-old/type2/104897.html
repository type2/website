Subject: Re: [T2] FI Pressure Regulator - Good Link, Sorry

&gt; Smelled a bit of fuel and peeked around, found this on my '79:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.skanky_dot_org/bus/wonder/
&gt; 
&gt; It appears that I have fuel (not a lot) loose around the pressure
 regulator.  It looks like it's equally on both sides of the
 regulator...  Has my regulator gone?  Do these clamps work loose?

I can't tell you much about your regulator......your pic is the cold start valve!

Try tightening the clamps. But it looks like they may be at the end of their threads.
