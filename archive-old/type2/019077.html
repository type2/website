Graham,
I don't know much about modifying the electronic portion of the wiper system
for speed.  However, I have been thinking of installing one of those
after-market intermitent switchs.  That way I could set the wipers to wipe
every few seconds on those days when it's not really raining out, and it's not
really dry out either.
Also, one time I converted an old 6volt bug to 12 volts.  I kept the 6volt
wiper motor in and it worked just fine.  It ran really fast, but it lasted for
the 2 years I owned the bug.  I lived on the California North Coast where it
rains all the time so the wipers saw their share of rain.  I'm not recommending
this setup, I'm just saying what worked for me.
Have a good day,

&gt; BTW, the wipers still run WAAAAY too slowly... is there a electronic unit I
&gt; can buy or build to make it go faster? Perhaps a dwell unit?
