&lt;&lt; Go to any car stereo place and get DYNAmat its good stuff to keep outside

sounds out and inside sounds in. It will also cut down on the rattle your

door might make. Its not the cheapest stuff but it is really good stuff. It

will also help in insulating your bus......

Shop around for Dynamat...Although the stuff is good, it's not gold as
a few stereo installers in my area were pricing it...
&lt;&lt; www.partsexpress_dot_com  &gt;&gt;
is a good starting place for pricing, but I seem to remember a listee
who found an outlet even cheaper/more realistic... ?-)
