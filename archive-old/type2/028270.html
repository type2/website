&gt;I consider VDO to be a good quality gauge - that's what I run.  I am
&gt;comfortable with 230, wary with 250, and disturbed by 270 - in fact I think
&gt;I would pull over before I let it get that high.  All this with good
&gt;synthetic oil - I wouldn't go as high with non-synthetics.

I have also used VDO gauges. On my last bus (a '64 with an H-series case built to a 1600), I installed 2 sending units and set them up on a toggle switch so I could monitor oil temp from the sump plate and also from the pressure relief valve. The temps at the latter were consistently higher by about 12 degrees. I would run up to about 235 or 240 on the relief valve sender. I watched the oil carefully and didn't see any excessive breakdown at those temps, but these were not sustained. Maybe 10 minutes at 240; always when I was going through the mountains. I think the sump plate sender registered lower because it was in the air stream; the relief valve sender was not. I suspect the latter gave a truer reading.

Now in truth, you can't tell if your gauge is accurate unless it's been calibrated and the sender has been tested with it under known conditions. Bob Hoover suggested using boiling water, I think, to test the accuracy of the sender because water boils at a known temperature.

I installed a temp gauge with a sump plate sender in the '77 engine I built for my '72 bus. I'll probably use 235 as my &quot;red line&quot; for this. If I can't keep the temps lower than that, maybe I'm not doing something right. But knowing that either the gauge or the sender could be off as much as 10 degrees, I'll take note of what the bus likes to run and watch the oil for signs of breakdown. If I see that the gauge registers 240 frequently and that all is well otherwise with the bus (dipstick test, etc.), I'll adjust my thinking. If it seems to run 180 most of the time, I'll probably think of 225 as redline. I learned a while back that the kinds of gauges and senders I can afford are best used as relative indicators. Changes in their readings are indicative of changes in my particular bus.

Thanks! Joe
