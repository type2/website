Subject: Re: Help '79 bus backfires / won't start.

Don,

A few days ago, trying to solve a problem of my engine cutting out, I did a
tuneup, changing my points, plugs, condensor, dist. cap and rotor. In doing
this I removed the distributor, replaced the points and condensor, and then
reinstalled it. When I tried to start it, I got a loud backfire. It would
not start. I rechecked everything. The rotor was turning, the points set
roughly to get started (then to be checked with dwell meter), the plugs
were in, wires connected, and wiring from distributor cap in the right
order (1-4-3-2).

I pulled the distirbutor again and reinstalled it. This time I pushed
firmly down on the top of the distributor shaft (not just the distributor
body) and felt it move down farther than it has when I had first
reinstalled it, engaging with the offset slot that it has to align with
down in the recess in which it fits. I hadn't done that the first time, I
had only pushed down on the dist. body; and I had thought that since my
rotor was turning, and since the distributor can only go in one way, then
it had to be in correctly. It wasn't. Although the rotor was turning, it
wasn't correctly engaged with the distributor drive correctly. After my
second reinstallation, pushing firmly down on the distributor shaft and
ensuring proper engagement with the dist. drive, my van started right up.

Hope this helps!

John

&gt;Help! My '79 bus is making me crazy.
&gt;
&gt;edit
&gt;
&gt;The Problem:   After reinstalling the engine in the bus it will not start!  It
&gt;will occasionally produce a loud backfire but no attempt to start.   The only
&gt;time I have heard backfiring on starting like that is when spark plug wires
&gt;are put onto the wrong cylinders.  (Their not I checked)
&gt;
&gt;What I have checked so far:  Timing is set. Plug wires on the right
&gt;sparkplugs.  Fuel pump is new and pumping.  Coil is producing good spark.
&gt;Spark plugs are getting spark.  CHT sensor is new and functioning properly.
&gt;All vacuum hoses are in place.  All grounds for fuel injection in place.
&gt;Injectors firing.
&gt;
&gt;I am out of Ideas and I really miss the Busted bus Pages!!!!   Thanks in
&gt;advance for your help!
&gt;
