Subject: RE: [T2] Online Swap Meets?

You can ship your booster off to be rebuilt for about $65 from H&amp;R in Texas 
and they do an amazing job. It seems a &quot;good&quot; used booster that has been 
tested will be about that much anyways.

I'm in your situation now and I found someone that had a bad booster and I'm 
buying for $20 bucks plus the rebuild it will be about $85 total....alot 
cheaper than just buying a rebuilt one straight out. If you do buy a used 
one hoping to put it in your bus and last a while be sure and vacuum test it 
before you buy it or atleast before you install to make sure the diaphram is 
still intact.

&gt;I am looking for a good used Brake Booster for my '74 Bus. I have been
&gt;searching around for a while, and boy are these things hard to come by.
&gt;I really can't afford to get a new one for $170+core right now.
