&gt;thought they did a nice job of not pimping it to much. They never did say what
&gt;they did to the engine. Although they added something like three batteries to
&gt;it and several invertors.

They never do anything to the engine. The last one I saw at a friends house 
they did about $15k worth of work to a Ford Escort to make it look like a 
BMW, but never opened the hood. They also completely restored a Cadillac 
and made it look sweet, but again, it drove like a 20 year old Caddy with 
worn out shocks, bad brakes and a smokey engine. They should fire one of 
the &quot;Put a tv screen on every flat surface&quot; guys and hire a mechanic.
