Subject: MINOR UPDATE: Engine swap help (76 2.0L into a 73 bus)

Ok, minor change.  It's a 73 bus (not 74) and the engine code is CB.
Should that cause any problems?  I'm guessing it's the same issues as if
it were a 74.

Thanks,
Mike

&gt; Hey Everyone,
&gt; My friend has a 74 bus with problems.  It's got bad compression so 
&gt; something needs to be done.  We're going to do a leakdown test to 
&gt; determine the problem, but ultimately, I have another idea that I'd like 
&gt; to try instead.
