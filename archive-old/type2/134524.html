Subject: Re: [T2] Which year bus for resto.

&gt;I would say, off the top of my head, whatever you want. =D
&gt;
&gt; Really!
&gt;
&gt; Have you driven both types? How much do you want to spend to get a
&gt; powerful and reliable engine? The handling difference between a split
&gt; and bay is huge.

Well, Ive driven a 68 (mine) and a 74.  Never noticed a difference in 
brakes, but I've never driven a splitty; why the big difference in handling? 
Thanks for the power/torque info.  Adding it to my decision tree :)
