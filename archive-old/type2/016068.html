&gt; 
&gt;  I just found / realized that the Beetlemex engine case, which is stamped as
&gt;  a VW / Audi logo Brazil AS41 case... has no stud for the thermostat
bracket.
&gt;  Nor does it even have a hole to put a stud in...


Yes thats right, these cases are being built for FI engines which look after
the temperature electronicaly.

Good luck
Bob
