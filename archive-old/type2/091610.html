Subject: Re: [T2] electrical gremlins - just about to leave on a trip...

 From the note it turned out to be the license plate light was shorting 
to ground.  I have seen this happen on quite a few older vehicles where 
problems turn up after replacing bulbs.  Note that these problems will 
rarely blow a fuse as they just provide an alternate current path and 
not a short to ground with enough of a draw to blow the fuse.  Yours was 
very likely a very similar type prob and you hit a bump or something 
that broke the alternate connection.

&gt;&gt; Sorry for those on both lists - I had to post this both places for 
&gt;&gt; maximum
&gt;&gt; coverage...I need ideas fast...

&gt;&gt; I finally thought my '71 Westy was ready to go for early tomorrow 
&gt;&gt; morning
&gt;&gt; on
&gt;&gt; a 3 week trip...fired it up to go for our goodbye dinner, and the brake
&gt;&gt; warning light was on...shite...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When I hit the brakes, warning light went off... ??? When the 
&gt;&gt; headlights
&gt;&gt; are
&gt;&gt; off, brake warning light is also off. When the headlights are on, with 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; brake warning light, the right turn signals and the brake lights don't
&gt;&gt; work.
&gt;&gt; When the headlights are off, things are ok.
&gt;
&gt; hey mine did this too, 78,  It did it for a few weeks and then stopped,
&gt; never did find what caused it???? drove me nuts for months.
&gt;  if you find out what it is post it here I would love to fix it what 
&gt; ever
&gt; &quot;it&quot; is.
