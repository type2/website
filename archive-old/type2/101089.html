Subject: Re: [T2] Re:2000cc Engine Mileage Poll

Richard,


In my opinion, 2.4qt/1000miles would be the absolute max.

My rule of thumb on a t1 engine is 1qt/3,000 miles(driven hard).

If it gets to be where it uses more than 1 qt between oil changes, then
you have a serious rebuild coming!

I don't remember what my last t4 engine did, but I can't ever remember
having to add oil between oil changes.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;   FWIW,I have around 196,000kms (nearly 120,000miles) on my last 2 litre
&gt; &gt;   rebuild and still going  strong...although it does use a little oil 
&gt; &gt;these days...
&gt; &gt;   fair enough really...
&gt; 
&gt; I like reading the owners miles for kicks and I found this snippet about oil consumption:
&gt; 
&gt; http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/manual/pg56.jpg
&gt; 
&gt; 2.4 qt per 1,000 miles is normal?  I've been going through 0.5 quart per 1,000 miles so I find this much larger rate surprising.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course this is the same manual that says 75mph is the crusing speed.
