Subject: Re: [T2] Starter wire gauge?

Not sure on yours but on my 82 it is at least a 2 gauge wire from the 
starter to the battery.  For wires this size if you dont have the 
correct crimper you may need to get your correct length of wire and take 
to someone to do the crimping.  BTW the last time i was doing battery 
work i used the 2 gauge wire and connectors from a power amp kit. It 
also had the 4 and 6 gauge wire i needed for that particular job.  You 
may be able to take your measurements to  one of the stereo install 
shops to get one made.  That cable isn't cheap.

&gt; I've got my motot out (for a clutch replacement which was relatively

&gt; PO may have tried to jump the battery with the cables crossed and burnt 
&gt; off all of the insulation off the starter wire. I don't wan't to buy 
&gt; this part from VWoA, so I'm gonna try and make my own. What gauge wire 
&gt; should I use, and if anyone has done this before, what do I need to be 
&gt; careful of? Thanks in advance
