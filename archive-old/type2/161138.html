I had the same experience. I ended up using the tabs from the kit and  
reusing the clamps.

&gt; The searches I've done confirm others have had this experience with  
&gt; sway bar mounting kits, but no
&gt; one has mentioned if there is a &quot;good&quot; one, or at least one that is  
&gt; closer to what's needed.
&gt; Wolfsburg West, CIP, and The Bus Depot all have kits that appear to  
&gt; be very close (at least in the
&gt; picture) to what was originally on the bus.

IF you can find a Mexican clamp, you'll find it matches our German  
hardware. The Brazil front beam isn't the same as the German one.

I know of no vendors selling the Mexican VW clamp. I was able to  
track down a clamp through the VW dealers but I didn't always have  
good luck:
