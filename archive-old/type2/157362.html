Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injector seal dropped into intake

My opinion is that it might have made a mess for a
moment, but even that is unlikely. It would most
likely have survived long enough to have been
exhausted and burned up in the exhaust system or
lodged momentarily in the exhaust valve and mad a hot
spot there for a few revolutions of the engine before
being totally vaporized. I certainly would never pull
the head to go after it. If it was one of the nuts
that holds the injector tight - that would have me
concerned!

Did you see my pics in my album about fuel injector
seals / retainers and resurfacing the post they perch
on?
-BaH
&gt;   But, to make the thread educational (aside from
&gt; the lesson of do not remove your paper towels from
&gt; the open intake holes for seal installation while
&gt; injectors are sitting above the open holes), IF the
&gt; seal would have gotten stuck into the cylinder, what
&gt; then? I know the BEST thing would be to remove the
&gt; head and get it out, BUT would it do terrible damage
&gt; to leave it in and burn it up? Would it burn up or
&gt; just create permanent goo in the cylinder?
