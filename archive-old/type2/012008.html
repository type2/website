Subject: Dual Relay Grounding Problem
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

Hello,
I am a new subscriber to the digest.  I have been
having a problem with my Dual relay on a 1982
Westfalia.  When I disconnect the dual relay from the
fire wall, my van starts and continues running. 
However, when I attempt to connect it to the fire wall
via the metal screw, then engines dies.

Not being an electrical engineer, I understand this to
be a grounding problem, but my expertise ends here. 
Anyone have a similar problem?  I am beginning to
think the dual relay my be ok but that the wires that
plug in  are the culprit.  Any help appreciated.  Thanks!
