&gt; By being on the list I have heard a lot about a manual called Bentley
&gt; something.  Can some one tell me what it is and how to get it.

Robert Bentley is a company that reprints import automakers' official
service manuals. By using a Bentley you will have the same information a VW
dealer's shop would have if VW dealers still worked on aircooled cars. Bus
Depot, aircooled_dot_net, your local VW parts haus, many larger bookstores and
even Amazon will have it, and it will run you the better part of $40.

For Loaf buses (68-79), the book you want has a green cover.
