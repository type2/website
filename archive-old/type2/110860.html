Subject: protecting fuel line from firewall tin.

As I recall Bob had one method for protecting the
fuel line as it ran through the fire wall.
  At the hardware store find the lighting section
and look for the threaded hollow tube that you would
use to make a table lamp. the hollow tube is for
running the power cord through.
  Insert the threaded tube into the firewall hole
and then lock it in with the nuts that come with the
kits.. So you have nuts on either side of the firewall
then just push the fuel line through the threaded
tube.
(I.D. is smooth). Same can be done for your throttle
cable where it runs through the firewall so it doesnt
saw into the tin over time....
