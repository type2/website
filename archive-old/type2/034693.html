Here is what the Bentley Bosch fuel injection book has to say about Hot 
start-Engine starts hard or fails to start when warm; A. insufficient 
residual fuel pressure; B. Cold start valve leaking or operating 
continuously; C. Fuel pressure incorrect.; D. Air-flow meter faulty. For a 
you should test the residual pressure, for b test the cold start valve and 
thermo-time switch, test fuel pressure, naturally, and lastly test the 
air-flow meter. Some of this technical stuff is on Sean Bartnik's page at 
Type2_dot_com. Check it. Off to continue the battle against my heater.
