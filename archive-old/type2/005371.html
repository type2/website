Hiya All

I'm trying to find out the original colour of my 1968 bay, but I can't seem
to find the paint codes referenced anywhere. I have tried all the usual
places, but every colour except mine seems to be listed.  The code I have
got is 474735.  47 being the colour top and bottom (early bays were one
colour only  from what I have read) and 35 being the interior.  Does anyone
know what these colours are.  Thanks a lot

Tammy
