Subject: Re: [T2] hooking up second battery

Personally i dont recommend using the starting battery for anything when 
you are parked.  However a 71 is probably a lot easier to push start 
than my 82 westy.  I use a power inverter on my aux battery for most 
things.  this is because the inverter has a cutoff for low voltage which 
prevents me from draining the battery far enough to be a loading problem 
on the alternator.  constant draining of a standard auto battery and 
recharging does shorten the life of the battery as well.

&gt; So what is the deal on how to set up a reserve battery in a 71 bus with 
&gt; the
&gt; 1600. Does the generator have enough power to charge both. How should 
&gt; it be
&gt; wired up, and when camping should you switch to use only one or that 
&gt; doesn't
&gt; matter, I also want to put it in a 72 with a 2.0l, that is ours and the 
&gt; other
&gt; is our sisters. thanks for the help
