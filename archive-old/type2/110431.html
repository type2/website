Subject: Re: [T2] new shocks..WD40

Hiya,

   Don't use WD40 for freeing rusted bolts. Use something like &quot;Liquid 
Wrench&quot; or
my favorite &quot;PB Blaster.&quot;  It'll be right by the WD40 on the shelf if you 
FLAPS carries it. I just use WD for reinstalling rusted bolts and the like. It's 
a good penetrating oil and I have had limited success with it. I've even gone 
so far as to use some brake fluid in a pinch (like out in the junk yard). But 
you'll have more luck with something designed to loose rusted components.
