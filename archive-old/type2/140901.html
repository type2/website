Subject: Re: [T2] 82 Vanagon - Heater control flap housing

From Andy:

 Bill,
I had a related question a few days ago, and here are the helpful
responses I received.
The heater box connects via flexible metal tubing to a piece of tailpipe
 that extends rearward, is supported by attachments to the motor mount,
 and exits just behind the rear wheel.
http://www.shockwaverider_dot_com/newbus/picture-005.html shows a photo of the pipe, and
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t202410.gif shows the parts on the fiche.

I was under the vanagon bleeding the clutch tonight and noticed that the
Heater control flap housing has a short duct that points to the rear

Andy and Bill,
I have never seen the exhaust pipes on a air cooled Vanagon. That was a bay thing.

All the Vanagons I have seen have the mushroom tops like the 72-77 flapper boxes. ETKA shows the mushroom top.
80-85 Bentley, page 80.2 does not show the exhaust pipes and page 80.3 shows the mushroom top.
