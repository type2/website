Subject: Peterson's Field Guide to Loaf ID

Hey all,

Given the recent traffic regarding how to identify various years of =
loafs, I thought it might be interesting to put together a =
=B3Peterson=B9s Field Guide to Identifying the Elusive Loaf=B2. My =
intention was not to leave you splitties out, it=B9s just that I =
don=B9t have a clue as to how to identify anything earlier than =8C68.

This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide, but rather just a =
quickie guide. You know how it is, you=B9re driving along and after =
you=B9ve finished waving at a family that didn=B9t wave back, you =
think =B3hmmm, wonder if they were driving a =8C73 or a =8C74?=B2

I just ripped this information off the gopher site, and pared it down =
to what I deemed bare essentials. Any additions or corrections would =
be welcomed.
