&gt; &gt; I take the 2000 auto and put it in the standard 73?  Alternatively, can
&gt; &gt; I take the 2000 and the auto trans and put the whole deal in the 73, and
&gt; &gt; please remind me again why I don't want to do that?

you will have to change the flywheel/clutch to a flexplate/torque
converter, and the flexplates (as far as I know) have the 5 small torx
bolts as opposed to the type I single large gland nut.  think the
diameters are different too

&gt; Don't know if you can mate an auto engine to a manual tranny,

yes if you change the flexplate to a flywheel clutch (BTW I might buy the
flexplate from you if you are selling)

&gt; I'd guess no.  You can install an auto engine and tranny
&gt; into a manual bus, a pal of mine has such a beast.  I'd

switching from auto to manual or vice versa is a lot more work than just
the tranny, even some of the mounts are different, also the auto tranny is
linked to the accelerator so that entires system has to be changed to. if
you are changing from auto to manual there is the clutch problem as none
of the tubes or mounts are there.

in other words it is a lot of work

&gt; discourage it.  You get worse gas mileage, more maintenance
&gt; hassle and parts problems, and not that much better
&gt; performance to show for it.

well I have a 2liter 78 auto tranny and I don't see much difference in the
fuel mileage, the maintenance is &quot;different&quot; but doesn't seem to be much
more or less than my old manuals,  the parts problem is significant (why
do you think I want to buy your flexplate?) 

&gt; But then, I've always been a Type 1 engine guy, so maybe
&gt; I'm biased.

had em both and would never even consider a type 1 engine again, heck if
you gave me an old bus the first question I would ask is &quot;how hard is it
to put a 2liter hyd lifter engine in it?!)

but then I'm biased too
