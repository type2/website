&gt; Good idea!  I have the sockets and not a torch, so I go for the hub nut
&gt; first thing,

yeah, I don't think I have ever pulled em off via the &quot;easy&quot; way

I also usually leave the tire on until it is pulled loose, sometimes never
even take the tire off the drum.  but it is awkward to put back on but it
makes it a lot easier to get the drum off because of the extra leverage
working from the tread end of the tire and wiggling


&gt; &gt; I did the front next and that was an amazingly easy
&gt; 
&gt; I know!  Ain't it tho!  99% of the time, I can do new pads on good
&gt; calipers in &lt;20 minutes!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; After getting the old pins out, I had to push the
&gt; &gt; pistons in, alot.  I must have used all 200 lbs of me
&gt; &gt; behind a 12&quot; bar, for 5 minutes each piston to get
&gt; &gt; them in enough to have space for the new pads.
&gt; 
&gt; Mark, this is a sure sign that the flex lines in the front are swelled
&gt; shut on the inside.  the pistons should go back in with only moderate

for sure!!

&gt; BTW, a Vice-Grip 12LC pliers will make pushing the piston back in an
&gt; easier task.  Forgot to mention that in the original post.

I generally Leave the old pads in so I don't damage the seals while I am
pushing the piston back, also makes it easier to push in my experience


&gt; &gt; It is just tedious, frustrating, and you will end up swearing.
&gt; 
&gt; Yah, I strongly agree...  the swearing is a mandatory part of the job,
&gt; unless you are enough of a saint to merit divine intervention  :-)

swearing in German makes it easier for the bus to understand
