Subject: RE: [T2] 914 2.0 in a 79 camper
Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 13:17:54 US/Mountain

&gt;What exhaust system can I use to hook up a 1973 2.0 Porsche 914 engine 
&gt;in a 79 camper? What can I use in the way of heat exchangers

Ron Salmon is correct.  The 72-74 bus heat exchangers and muffler are the 
ticket on this one.

If you have a correct 73 914 2.0 motor, you'll notice that you have 3-bolt 
intakes on the heads (if they've been swapped for less expensive bus ones or 
1.7/1.8 914 ones then they'll be 4-bolt).  If they're 914 2.0 heads, the spark 
plug holes are located differently.  This means you'll need to cut new holes in 
your bus cylinder tin using a keyhole saw and you should close up the old holes 
(fiberglass works well for this).  You can't use the 914 tin because the whole 
engine compartment is shaped differently.

You'll also want to close off the hole in the tin where the bus oil filler tube 
used to go (914's fill from the breather box on top).  

And you'll need to use the BUS flywheel, not the 914 one.  Also check the 
length of the 2 lower studs that go through the transmission.  They're probably 
too long and you may want to install shorter ones.

You'll also need to install a pilot bearing in the end of the crankshaft - 
914's had theirs in the flywheel.  The opening in the crank is the same size so 
no problem - just make sure you put one in there!

If your 914 motor has an FI distributor, you'll need to replace it with 
something else unless you're planning on using the complete 914 d-jet FI system

Probably way more info than you wanted, but I've been there.  Let me know if 
you've got any other questions about this.
