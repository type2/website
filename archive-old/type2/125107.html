Subject: Which came first, chicken or egg?

Sorry for the not so clever subject line, couldn't resist.
How do you get into the heat adjust levers on a late Bay?
Bently shows removing the instrument pannel but the plastic levers are
attached to the metal levers with small pins.
The instrument pannel won't come off without removing the platic levers, you
can't get to the lever pin with the pannel in place.
Maybe come in from the top?  Looks like the top of the dash can be removed
with the windshield in place.
My red heat / direction levers won't pass each other.
Thanks,
Mike
