&gt;    79 Westy in need of exhaust.  Everything gone behind heat exchangers.
79,
&gt; is of course, a 79 only exhaust system. But I see in the Bus Depot catalog
&gt; that a 74 system will work, but w/ no converter.

&gt;     I'm wondering- has anyone bolted 74 exhaust on their 79? Can a layman
&gt; like me with ordinary hand tools bolt 74 exhaust right on? Without a torch
or
&gt; a welder?

I 'see' you have 2 list replies but neither mentioned the exhaust ports.
Does your 79 have square ports?
Or oval ports?
If you have oval ports, yes you can use 72-74 heater boxes.
You cannot bolt 72-74 oval port boxes to square port heads.
