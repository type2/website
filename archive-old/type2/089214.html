Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Noses

I checked that out already.. Heck.. That's as much as it cost me for my
whole buses, sans engines, and they came with good noses. I think this guy
is selling German surplus items, mainly German army stuff. There's an
interesting heater that's sort of like an Eberspracher for the German
version of the Hum-vee. The only problem is, it's not exactly cheap, and
it's 24V. Works on any kind of fuel.. That part is good. I guess you could
set it up, but another PITA, electrically speaking. Could you set up a
separate two batteries and put them in series to produce a 24V output,
feeding the batteries from two isolated voltage regulators, and install an
alternator (in place of the normal generator) to run everything? So, you
would have then one alternator, three parallel 12v voltage regulators
(small, easy to install), and probably diode-protected outputs going to two
storage batteries, connected in series. That would give you your 24V.
Whad'ya think? Jan B
