    Yep, shorting a battery lets off a lot of enery very quickly
   [snip]
    With regard to preventing battery shorts and to enable quick disconnects
    we have on sale in the UK quick release connectors. Instead of a bolt on 
    connector they work by a lever clamping action. 
   [snip]
    In the event of a fire these are very easy to disconnect. They are also 
    sufficiently easy to give you no excuse for not disconnecting the battery
    while you do that electrical job.
    
    I can let UK folk know where to get them if they mail me. Any-one know 
    where for you boys and girls in the USA?
    
I just saw these at Pep Boys....I'm pretty sure they were Exide brand,
so they should be just about everywhere.

Thought is was a good idea...may have to do it soon..
