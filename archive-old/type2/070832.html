&lt;&lt; Todd, here's a question for you:  If I have a trans (68-70) that 
pops  out of 4th, and I want to squeeze the most life out of it 
before it  gives out, can I just keep it pulled back and in gear 
with a bungee  cord, or will this accelerate its eventual demise?&gt;&gt;

Sounds like typical 3rd/4th slider wear to me.  Sure, try the 
bungee cord route and see if that works.  If the wear isn't too
bad then you can squeeze a few more miles out of it.  If the
wear is too much then it'll pop out even if you hold it in gear
by hand.  The shift fork will now be in constant contact with
the slider and it will begin to wear as well, however, I don't
think that you'll do any irreparable damage.  

I'd start to put aside some money for the rebuild thats in your 
near future.  I see similar wear and tear on transaxles all the
time and take it as a matter of fact.  After all, the trans could
be as old as 31 years now!
