Subject: Re: [T2] Good wipers?

I bought &quot;snow&quot; blades for my IH Scout 6 years ago from Bisio Motors in Portland, Oregon, I bought an OEM arm at the same time and the bill was 40 bucks I think.

I need to replace them this year.

The have seen sticks and mud and snow and ice and they have finally rotted, probably from parking it under a tree too much.
