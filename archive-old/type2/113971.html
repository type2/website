Subject: Wanted - full width rear seat

I have decided that, in the interest of safety the side-facing rear seats in my Safare have to go.  This was a tough decision because the side-facing seats are the most unique aspect of the Safare layout.  Nevertheless, they are coming out (going up into the attic) and I want to put in a full-width seat with fold-down backrest in its place.  The seat can be out of a standard passenger bus, or Adventurewagen conversion.

I would prefer a seat in good condition.
I would also prefer a black seat, though I would consider other colors (I can dye it).
The closer to Dallas Tx. the better.
I will pay a good price for the right seat so if you have a pristine one and want to get full dollar for it, here's your chance.

Please contact me off-list.

Thanks,
	-David
