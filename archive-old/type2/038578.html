&gt; hex. (All of the screws were still in, but loosened a 1 turn, then tightened 
&gt; back up, so I didn't have the weight of the door on the last screws.) What do 
&gt; I do? Am I SOOL? 

git ye down to your local FLAPS and pick up a set of &quot;EZ-OUTS&quot; (Buy best
quality you can) read the instructions, work carefully WEAR GOGGLES it is
a real PITA but they will come out
