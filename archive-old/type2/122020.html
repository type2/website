&gt; only two things ever really bugged me about owning a VW and that was

I agree.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that not having to deal with 
the valves and points is going to increase the likelihood that I 
perform regular maintenance more, well, regularly.  The points are such 
a pain to get to on the Type 4 engine that you basically must pull the 
distributor to adjust/change them, and I always found any task 
involving removal of the valve covers to be annoying on a VW engine.

My new engine came with hydraulic lifters, and Santa left a Pertronix 
kit under the tree for me this year, hooray!
