&gt; &gt;And where do you find magnesium on a loaf???
&gt;
&gt; Someone correct me if I am wrong, but aren't the transaxle
&gt; cases made of
&gt; magnesium through at least 1979?  Sure felt like magnesium when I was
&gt; tapping a bellhousing bolt hole in a '76 tranny a couple of years ago.

And don't forget those fan housings.  My '76 has a magnesium fan housing (go
ahead, ask me how I know - hint:  don't try TIG welding magnesium with
aluminum settings)
