Subject: Steel Braded Fuel Lines and Fittings

List-
  I am once again trying to improve the fuel lines on my 1972 VW Bus.   
I think the line fron the fuel tank to the engine is poorly designed  
and is a fire hazard.  I would like to run a steel braded line from a  
fitting on the tank to the fuel pump with a shut off valve at the  
tank.  These lines would have threaded ends on them.  Has anyone done  
this?  I think I can get the parts from a boat supply store if I knew  
exactly what to get.
My question is:  What kind if thread is on the fitting on the bottom  
of the tank where the line now connects?  I don't want to take it out  
without having a new fitting ready to replace it.  Is it what they  
call &quot;pipe thread&quot;?  metric?

Thanks for your help.
