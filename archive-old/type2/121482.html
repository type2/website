&gt;&gt; Bus Boys is closed because of the weather. Snow made the roads

Yah, I just managed to place an order with them at about 3pm today.  
Their power came back about 4pm yesterday.  He indicated to me over the 
phone that they plan on extending the year-end sale for a couple of 
days to make up for the couple of days that people couldn't place 
orders.

Happy New Year, everybody.  May the year be full of happy journeys in 
your Bus.
