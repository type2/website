I would definitely check all the connections, especially the
ones between the battery and starter. Start by disconnecting
the battery, as it's easy to engage the starter when messing
with the connections down there. I once failed to disconnect
the battery and the starter got hung...inching the bus forward
with me laying under the wheel. Since I was uphill, I managed
to get out in time to avoid a tragedy, but I was close to becoming
a statistic.

Also, check the charge on your battery. If you're getting a dead
cell, your bus (a '79, presumably with FI) won't start below
a certain voltage.

Good luck! Joe
