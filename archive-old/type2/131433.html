Subject: Solar Panel

Hello all-
I have been looking at mounting a solar panel on the roof of my van for a 
couple of months now.  I have a few questions before I commit to doing it 
though...  I am currently looking at the 100 W SolarPro put out by ICP Solar 
(www.icpsolar_dot_com) which is 30 lbs. but comes with a mounting kit and charge 
controller.  I would be using it to run a 3A fridge and charge the battery 
when I am in the wilderness for more than a couple days.

1) Have any of you done this?  How effective has it been? Any suggested 
kits?

2) I am mounting it to a pop-top that I still want to pop.  I planned on 
doing it above the hinges so that the weight is not multiplied by the 
leverage of the roof.  The model I am looking at is 30 lbs.  If most of that 
weight is over the hinges, would it damage/bend them?

3) What would you reccommend in terms of mounting to the fiberglass?  Also 
any reccommendations for wiring the cable through?

Thanks much - Trying to get myself ready for a trip halfway across the 
country!
