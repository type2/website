Hi Volks,

Take a deep breath, and click on
http://www.geocities_dot_com/vw_type2/westification/

Bet you can't hold that breath until the pics load.

It's a runner up for &quot;Ugliest HTML of the year&quot;, but the pictures tell you
where we're at. With a tailwind it could be there at EveryBus 2001!

Now that the cutting is finished, the next step is to weld it together. We
have a small arc-welder with a gas bottle...  but none of us have any
experience with it. If anyone knows of a good how-to video or web-page where
I can research the technique, I'd be happy to hear from them.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
