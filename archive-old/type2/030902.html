&gt; &gt; &gt; like to use the electric pump, since I'm using the same carb as the PO and
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't want to re-route the hoses.  Do I need to remove the mechanical pump
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; easiest route would be to take the fuel pump off, remove the push rod,
&gt; &gt; then put it back until you can get a block off plate

&gt; MUCH more satisfactory would be to leave the stock mechanical pump in
&gt; place and re-route the hoses, bypassing the electric pump. Hook the
&gt; inlet hose from the electric hose to its outlet and unhook the wire.

&gt; good reason manufacturers don't use ignition-switch-triggered electric
&gt; fuel pumps without safety interlocks and that's fear of lawsuits from
&gt; incinerated victims.

Which is what I suggested in the para you deleted!  I have used nothing
but electric fuel pumps for 20+ years and they ALWAYS shut off when the
engine stops, that is why I have no problem with em,  even the fuel pump
to the aux heater stops if the heater stops.  it is not hard to do and the
instructions are usually with the pump.

as for in an accident.

the FIRST RULE in any accident whether your own or one you come accross is
to ALWAYS TURN OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH.  then do anything else you are
trained or knowledgeable enough to do
