Subject: Re: [T2] #3 not again

After checking compression several times and doing the oil squirt, I did adjust 
the valves (hydraulics) and test again.  #3 is going, going...

Our new house doesn't even have a driveway, let alone a garage, and I really 
can't imaging doing this job on the street.  I've got tons of things I need to 
fix in our house (104 years old) and prepare for winter and really don't have 
the time for this project.  Maybe you can slap on a new head in a few hours, but 
it would take me much longer!  I've done it once before and had a mechanic do it 
the second time.

I've been at this juncture before, and I've put thousands of dollars into this 
bus already.  Time for me to move on.  I just want to know how long I can get by 
with the bus in this kind of shape.

&gt; If the valve is dead, get another head and slap it on there. Takes a few hours. Fix the broken head for a spare...

&gt; VW busses have GOT to be the cheapest vehicle on the planet to operate even if they are alot of trouble sometimes!
