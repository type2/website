Subject: &quot;Hiss&quot; -&gt; loose valve seat / leaky head gasket?

Hi all

I've got a '76 bus with dual carbs that has recently been suffering from a loss of power and rough running.  A tune / service a couple of weeks ago (set timing, valve clearances + new points, plugs etc) made no real difference to this loss of power.  The best clue to this I have is that I can hear a gentle hissing noise from the engine every fourth crank when starting.  A compression check resulted in 95/100/100/110 readings (not sure which cylinder gave what number), hence it couldn't be valve seat, could it?!

I have stopped driving my bus in case it is valve related.  My regular mechanic thinks it _is_ most likely valve-related and is trying to get me to fork out for a new head (~$700AUS complete) rather committing himself to fix the current one (if indeed that is what the problem is).

Anyone else ever experince this &quot;hissing&quot; noise?

Thanks for any assistance

Mike
