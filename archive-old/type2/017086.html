Are you sure you don't have any exhaust leaks?

&quot;all this cool smog crap on my bus which i disconnected.&quot;

Did it backfire before you disconnected it?

&quot;Did (either way it b/f's)i do not have big backfires, just these small
mini ones when i decel. does that still mean i have a lean mix? and how
the heck to i mix it right?&quot;

This should be in the archives, I suspect.

&quot;i've never had my carbs redone since i have dual carbs and it'll cost
too much to fix.  after november i am planning to rip out my dual carbs
an switch to single carb so i dont want to
redo my duals now. anything i can do in the meantime that doesnt cost 50
million dollars?&quot;

Having the PDSITs redone would cost less than it would cost to buy a new
single carb, which won't work right anyway, based on my experience.
