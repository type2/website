Subject: Engines &amp; Trannies FS in Utah

New engines and tranny available in Utah

A few years ago I purchased a 1983 Vanagon to rebuild
as a work van.  I bought a rebuilt Rancho transaxle
for it.  I built up a  2 litre engine from scratch for
it including new barrels, heads, main and cam shafts,
hydralic lifters, and new oil pump as well as bearings
and seals througout.  

I then found a newer 91 waterboxer I liked better for
a work van and the 83 has just been sitting.  The
problem is I have more in the unit than I can get for
it  ($2095 and the whole thng is yours) so I am going
to part it out as follows:

TURN KEY engine option...............$1750
Fresh built long block plus cooling shroud and fan,
heater boxes, intake manifold, etc.
just install the unit and turn the key!  (You will
need your old dizzy as I am going to keep this one to
put back in my parts cache for the one I loaned to a
AIDS patient from Princeton NJ that he never returned)

Long Block Only................$1500  (Brand New
Heads)
Put you own skin and manifold , etc  and install

I also have a rebuilt but slightly used short block
out of a 77 availabe.  I rebuilt this engine for my
77 Westy a few years ago and shortly thereafter had a
rocker arm stud break on one of the heads.  I bought a
whole replacement engine off a railroad action, so I
never reused this engine.

SHORT BLOCK  ................$400
Fairly fresh rebuilt case up with barrels and pistons
(no heads)

77 REBUILT Head  (Left) .........................$95

83 used pair of heads (not rebuilt but good shape)  
($100)
Put these on the 77 short block and use for a 79-
through 83

80-83 091 Fresh Rebuild Rancho Tranny............$500

78 091 used Tranny
( I saved this tranny for a guy in Port Heunume,
California, but I crashed my computer disc last spring
and lost his name and address.  If you are still
interested please get back to me or I will sell this
also)


Mountain West Travelers and local AIDS listees: Keep
this list and my phone number so when you burn up that
30 year old engine this year traversing the Rockies
youll have a replacement close at hand.

Engines and Trannys warranteed for 10,000 miles-- 
Bring back the unit, I ll return the Money 

Utah or surrounding States.  I dont want to ship
these.
