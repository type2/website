Subject: Re: [T2] Blatant spam: Rust-o-leum Industrial Enamel

The only problem with using any rustoleum product is that`s where it is
and that`s where it will be for good.
It has fish oils in it to slow down rust--that`s good--
But you will never be able to apply anything ever on top of it, other
than rustoleum.
Which I guess isn't all that bad--- 
As long as your into rustoleum
Any other material you lay on top of it in the event you may want to
change from the safety yellow one day, won't stick and it will fisheye
like crazy----

In the paint department at Home Depot (disclosure: I sell lumber there)
you will find a product called Rust-O-Leum Industrial Enamel. It comes
in quart and gallon cans; the gallons cost $22. It's packaged in the
most delightful colors--safety red, safety yellow, black, a light blue
for making handicapped signs, and a couple other colors I'm not
remembering right now. There's also a Primer for Clean Metal and a
Primer for Rusty Metal. All of the topcoats are glossy. There's also a
special traction additive for making non-skid walking surfaces. 
I got a can of this stuff in Safety Yellow (Home Depot employees pay
full freight on all our purchases) and painted the catwalks on a
printing press with it. I used a brush. It flows out really nice and
looks good. Catwalks are already nonskid, so no problem with the gloss.
It thins with plain ol' mineral spirits. 
It ain't car paint quality, but it's a far sight better than a rattle
can job--and at $44 for a can of primer and one of topcoat, it's about
as cheap.
