Subject: Re: Bus Depot where are you?

From: Simonetti Andrea &lt;simonetti_at_didael.it&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know why they don't answer?!? Did I trust too much? what about my credit card!?

Not this thread again! :-)  Andy, I can't speak to the vagaries of international shipping, but I just got an order from them the day before yesterday and it 
came in pretty fast and just as expected.  I've dealt with them for years with zero problems.  So I think your trust and credit card are safe.
