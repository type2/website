Subject: Getting Clutch Lever off of cross shaft (longish)

     Well it never fails, Try to make a little improvement, make more 
problems for myself. This time I decided that while my transmission 
(transaxle) was out for some other repairs, I would replace the return 
spring on the clutch cross shaft lever. Having the broken spring wasnt 
really causing a problem for me but I figured I would replace it out of 
good practice.

     As it turned out, removing the lever from the cross shaft was a 
huge pain in the A*&amp;  I actually ended up buggering up the shaft pretty 
good getting the lever off.

     I figured, no big deal....I had another tranmission laying around, 
I would just take the cross shaft and lever off of it and put the parts 
on my good transmission.....turned out to be even worse than the first 
lever removal. (I actually still have not gotten the lever off)

     If anyone out there has an extra cross shaft, lever and spring for 
a '72 or compatible, please let me know.I know that they can be 
pruchased online for a premium but would rather not pay the premium.

     Also if anyone knows the &quot;trick&quot; to getting the lever off of the 
shaft, please let me know. It may allow me to salvage the one I have on 
my spare transmission.

     Thanks for any help; Advice or Parts. -Jeff
