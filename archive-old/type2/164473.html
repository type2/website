Lots of buses and crazy Bus Pilots are coming from everywhere to enjoy Bus
Boo this weekend in Grand Rapids, MI! This Halloween Theme campout is great
for kids of all ages and adults. 

We are so excited! It looks like we are going to have another great turn
out. There will be great chili, tie dying, train rides, and lots of crazy
costumes. 

If you are planning on coming and would like to Tie Dye some items make sure
you bring them on Saturday and go to the forum to read the details.

Also Saturday night will be the Chili Cook Off. So bring your crock pot and
Mom's best recipe. If you don't know a good recipe then just bring your
appetite because there is going to be lots of food to eat! Bring your own
side dishes and table service. 

Please call Grandrogue Campground to make reservations if you haven't
already done so. (1-616-361-1053) 
Have a safe and enjoyable trip in. 

If anyone needs any help feel free to reach us at the Grandrogue Campground
and ask for one of the head knuckleheads from Buses By the Beach. 

Wishing you many miles of smiles!
