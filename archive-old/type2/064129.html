Subject: Unsub Instructions

Otay, I know this is a newbie question, but will someone please forward
the unsubbing instructions for the type2 list to me. I'm moving; this is
my last day at this job...and I need to unsub until I get a new e-mail
address. I have the instructions somewhere....but who knows where that is?

It's 11:00 am, so if you read this after 3:00 pm on Friday, don't bother
sending the instructions...someone else already did.

Sorry for the wasted bandwidth. If I win the lotto, I'll randomly award a
dozen good splitties to make up for it. 8) That's a promise!

Thanks! Joe
