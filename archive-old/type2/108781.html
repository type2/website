Subject: Dr. Tim and the Deutch Method

Well, it's almost Friday so I'll try and slip this one in.

Dr. Tim is well known to all of us on the list as having very exacting
standards of STOCK GERMAN ONLY!!! Do it once, do it right, the cost will
balance out in the long run.

All very true, can't argue with the logic or the results.

I can also agree with Billy, having been in his position more than once.
Quite often my priority has to be function rather than perfection. Financial
reality can make it difficult to justify the $100 part ( and that's assuming
I even have $100 to spend on ANYTHING) when I can get one that works for
$40. I know it won't last as long and I accept the responsibility for that.
My bus is my daily driver and I have to have it on the road--no excuses.
Sometimes I have to use the part I can get today, not the one that can be
here next week.

That being said, I can appreciate that Dr Tim is proceeding under a
different paradigm. As a professional mechanic selling his services to the
general public, he has to be concerned about things that don't apply to the
home mechanic. At the end of the day he has to look his client in the eye
and justify every minute of labor billed, the cost of each part replaced and
the necessity of replacing it, as well as the longevity of the repair. On
top of that he has to do it in such a way as to make his client glad he did
it and want to come back again after telling all his friends. Not the
easiest way to make a living but to each his own.

Anyhow, maybe we could cut the good Dr a bit of slack considering his
particular perspective. Then again, maybe he could cut us a little slack as
well.

Done rambling
