Dear friends,

This is a serious problem. As someone wrote, the ECU may suddenly go into
German mode. Given the time difference between Europe and the USA (6-9
hours) that could cause your car to suddenly halt for said amount of time.

In addition to this an often overlooked problem is that the year 2000 is a
leap year. Most people assume it is not because years ending with 00 are
normally not (the exception is once every 400 years).  This could very well
mean that your car (not limited to VW's) as well as various other computer
controlled appliances will not work on february 29 th, 2000 or thereafter.

Most people expect the biggest problems will become apparent in the first
days of 2000. I expect the biggest mess by the end of february of that year.

BTW lots of very useful info is available on the internet and trust me it is
not a hoax like so many of the computer virus scares. I know, I have
produced quite a bit of non-year-2000-compliant code until I started to
realise the problem (luckily many years ago).
