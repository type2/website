&gt; Where is the thermostat located on a type 1 engine??  I see so many beetles

It's above the tin just inboard of the right heater box and is visible
with a flashlight without removing anything.  To remove you take out a
piece of tin (four screws), the nut on the end of the bracket, and unscrew
the thermostat from the pushrod.

Look first, as I find very few bugs with the bellows in place.  Usually an
empty bracket.

&gt; Can the 914 thermostat (12 bellows) be used in lieu of the type IV 910
&gt; bellows) thermostat, or is there something critical about the temperature
&gt; openings on the two.

The temperature is stamped on the end of the thermostat, IIRC.
