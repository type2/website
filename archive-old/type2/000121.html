Subject: Orange Plaid Cloth Part 2

Whoops, I pushed the wrong button.

Anyway if you need the orange cloth that does not have green, call Bill Weber 
at
440-332-9459 or 440-323-6414.  He was very helpful on the phone.

Meanwhile for me, if someone has an old upper bunk or seat pad with the 
orange with green plaid, and it's in good shape, I'd like to buy the cover 
material for seat covers.
