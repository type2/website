Hello again ,
    I love this list.  I may be a lurker, with the occasional imput, but
this list has provided me with more information than most of my vw books and
for that.......Thankee-sai.  Are there any junkyard dogs out there who can
help me out?  I've been to most of the autosalvage yards in my area, but
have been unable to find a matching dash for my 78 Champagne Edition
transporter.  The PO of my bus was a radio(ham, cb) nut and he modified to
his liking the dash to fit one of his head units.... Needless to say when he
sold the bus he kept the equipment and left a gaping 3X5 hole in the dash
beneath the stock radio hole.  I want to mount some gauges in this spot,
which has been covered very nicely, until yesterday with a piece of
paneling.  Anyhow, the installation I want to do uses Bus Boys's 3 gauge
mounting plate which fits in the same place.  They say, on their web site,
that the gauges hold the trim in place.  But with no dash material to cut
the gauge holes out of, I am at a loss.  So is my dilema.  I need a
replacement dash(hard, expensive, and hard to find) or a section of a dash
3.5x5.5 steel, pad and vinyl to spot weld into place.  Anyone else
considered patching up their bus like a field hospital??  Any suggestions or
comments as to the practicallity of welding a patch into place are welcome
and much needed!!!  I think a saws-all would make quick work of the removal
from a donor.  Also, there will be compensation for time spent, price of
3.5x5.5 section of dash and loads of love from the Smith Family.

TIA
Isaiah Smith
78 Champy
