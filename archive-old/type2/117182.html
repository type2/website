Mike

That Golf sounds expensive. We would be looking at 600 UKP for a good one
that age.

The parts are available for Kombis, you will need to search around on the
web. I'd suggest you visit www.volksworld_dot_com to find some good links. As
far as I know only the engines are rebuilt in SA. The metal fronts and
other parts I'm not sure about. Allan Schofield in the UK makes repro parts
BUT shipping of sheet metal parts is expensive if you want them in an
uncrushed state !

Good luck with the negotiations :-)

Hello, Philip!

Congrats on your new engine for Ashley. If i take your pounds and convert
it to our Mickey
Mouse rand, i got a shock...!


Smelly salts helped....

Now you can imagine why we can not afford new things....
Just look at an old VW Golf, Mk 1. Just as &quot;old&quot; as it was in 1983...
But now it retails at 74000 Rand, making it approx 5692 pounds....
Would you pay that for an old Golfie?

Anyway, why I'm writing to yoy is this, that you said, your supplier's
warehouse was full
with SA made parts.
Are you talking of Kombi parts?

Because if you are, I'd like to know more, as we Volksie fans struggle to
get bits and
pieces.
I even drove deep into the free state, complete with on board geni, large
anglegrinder ,
cutting torch et al, just to get a left rear end for my splittie. This part
was sourced by
aNOTHER MAD vOLKSIE FAN amidst a kraal, and I must now negotiate with the
chief of the
village for it. (What a shlepp!)

So, please phil, tell me more!
Looking forward to hear from you.
In the meantime, from a summerly warm Melville near Johannesburg, i bid you
well.

Greets, Mike Bernard
