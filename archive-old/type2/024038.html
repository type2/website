Subject: Hawaii members
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a gentleman that is in the process of buying my 66 split panel van 
with a sliding door.  I'm trying to hook him up with other club members or 
owners in Hawaii that will be of assistance to him when he arrives. He also 
prove to be a  future friend or club member  on his way from Germany.
Increase The Peace
