Subject: Re: [T2] Engine conversion

&amp;lt;In the Vanagon, it was rated at a WHOPPING 45 hp!!! In the Rabbit, it was 58 HP.&amp;gt;

In other words - slower than the stock aircooled engine at 67 HP... And probably able to pull telephone poles out of the ground if it is anything like the diesels I have driven... &amp;lt;grin!&amp;gt; 

Actually I drove a Vanagon double-cab diesel quite a bit in Italy and though I would have gladly owned one it was not fast at all... Did drive several early 90's turbo diesel Golfs and they were quite fun.
