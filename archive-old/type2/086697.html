Subject: hesitation problems

I hope someone on this list can shed some light on a problem that I have
been having with my 77 Westy.
I recently purchased the camper from a guy who had it stored in a garage
for about ten years, After getting her home I
pulled the engine, tore it dowm to the long block,  and cleaned and
reassembled it. I replaced the injectors and fuel pump
put the engine back in and she started and ran fine. The only problem is
that after the engine gets fully warmed up it starts
to bog out whyen I step on the gas. It will idle fine, but won't
accelerate. The weird part of all this is that if I shut off the ignition
and restart she runs fine again. Has anyone out there ever experienced this
problem with a fuel injected type 4 engine?
I hope someone can shed some light on this mystery.
