&gt;&gt;It contains Methyl Propyl Ketone (107-97-9), Xylene (133-20-7), N-Butyl
&gt;&gt;Acetate (123-86-4), Napta (6472-95-6), Magnesium Silicate
&gt;&gt;(14807-96-6).   Maximum V.O.C. 400 grams/liter.  (What the does that all
&gt;&gt;mean?)

Each number is a CAS Registry number, sort of an ID number for the chemical.
The first four are solvents.  Magnesium silicate is a powder similar in
nature to sodium silicate (water glass).  Water glass with the appropriate
additives makes a good glue for many things, so I assume MgSiO3 does much
the same thing.

&gt;&gt;I don't see zinc listed anywhere.
&gt;
&gt;Magnesium, aluminum, they work too. It's a goopy silver paint and it smells
&gt;ghastly, right? It is probably a very good rust inhibitor if you can stand
&gt;to apply it.

Magnesium silicate is very different from magnesium metal.  And the solvents
listed actually are classified as &quot;pleasant-smelling&quot; by most chemists.
Unpleasant = methylamine (dead fish), butyl mercaptan (skunk), skatole
(human feces)...

Quiz next Friday...
