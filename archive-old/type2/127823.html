Subject: Re: [T2] LPG Pressure Regulator leak 

&gt; When I open the valve 
&gt; on the propane tank, there is a hissing sound from
&gt; the regulator mounted 
&gt; on the side of the tank (outside left side) and the
&gt; smell of propane. 
&gt; removed the cover from the regulator and localized 
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions?
 
  Simple. 
Go buy a new regulator and be done with it. You can
get
it done at a RV shop or just buy the part from there
and install it yourself. Depending on what you do the
cost should be from around 30 to 60 bucks.
Goodluck. 

Wes
