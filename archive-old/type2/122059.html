Subject: RE: [T2] Re: type of engine is this?

I have rebuilt a couple mopeds.. they typically run 49-250CC.  My state does
not require license plates on anything under 150CC.  My WeedEater is 21CC!!

His VW shop is lied to him.   If he meant 2100CC, which is more likely, I do
not believe that VW made a 2100 CC water cooled motor.
