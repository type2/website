Aaron,

I had to do some work on my son's Toyota Corolla a few months ago and my 
local non-VW guru, as opposed to my VW guru, suggested I use brass nuts 
on the exhaust manifold. These were readily available from the local 
exhaust specialist. Presumably, there should be the required metric size 
available for your VW.

I'm sure Canberra has an exhaust specialist or two. Give them a call.

By the way, people from Canberra have been known to bring their VWs to 
Orange for the attention of our local VW man. His reputation extends 
far and wide.

Regards
