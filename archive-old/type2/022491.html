Subject: RE: [T2] More Merc Wheel Info
Mime-Version: 1.0

Nice post Derek, I hope I can shed some more light on the subject. 

VW and other German car manufacturers mark their wheels with 
an ET value. ET, or Einpress Tiefe, means &quot;press in depth&quot;
(freely translated). The value represents the difference between 
the center of the rim and the surface of the wheel that will mount 
against the hub of the car in mm. The position of the center of the 
rim in relation to the wheel bearings and suspension and steering 
geometry is important and shouldn't be changed. The wheel can 
be any width, but as long as the ET and tire diameter are unchanged 
the center of the rim will still be where the manufacturer intended it 
to be, in other words, the track width of the vehicle, center to center 
of rim/tire, will remain unchanged. 

As for using Mercedes, BMW, or older Audi wheels, just check the 
ET on the wheel, and it if it is the same (or very close) as what came 
stock on your Bus (ET39), then you can use them. If the ET is higher 
they will sit deeper into the body and vice versa. ET can be lowered 
with a spacer, but you can't make the ET higher without machining 
and/or welding on the wheel.  Example, you find Merc wheels with 
ET44, a 5mm spacer will bring the ET down to the ET39 you need 
for your Bus. I know from experience that ET changes of, say, 10mm 
or more are very evident in the behaviour of the car. (steering and 
braking)

Hope it helps, 

Brian.
