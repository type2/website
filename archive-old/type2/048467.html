Subject: [T2] Smoke and Oil Solved!

Hello all,

Thanks for your tips. If you recall, I had an oil leak which I feared to be
related to an oil gallery plug. Luckily it was just a matter of having a loose
fuel pump which allowed oil from the crankcase to blow over the engine and burn
off, creating much smoke and unpleasant odor. So it was just a matter of
tightening a twelve point bolt. Pretty great if you ask me. 

Thanks again,
 - Ian Bridwell

Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For 
instance, let's say you're an astronaut on the 
moon and you fear that your partner has been 
turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out 
for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the 
door behind him and blast off. He might call 
you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but 
you just say, &quot;Think again, bat man.&quot;
