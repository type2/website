There are a couple of potential rescue bus candidates I know
of.  If interested drop a line.  I drive by these daily.

'71 Bus used as a dog house, no engine, slider always left open,
couple of windows broken.  Probably will sell cheap.

Late Bay fixed hightop camper, parked beside a garage.
Haven't asked owner about this one, waiting for someone
with interest to drop me a line.


For sale along the side of my commute road:

'87 Westi, blue on blue, new motor, rebuilt trans, new tires shocks,
and struts + more  916 or 530-663-4814  $8500
I can check this one out easily as it's on my daily travels.

Notice that my sig line shows my two '80's are for sale.  After I get
the driver running I'll post details.  If interested now, drop a line.
