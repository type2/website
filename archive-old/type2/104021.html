&gt; Check Bentley. Where are the specs for this off idle spring adjustment??
&gt; Not there, ergo, not proper. The only spec is for setting at idle. The only
&gt; resolution for the dicked with or worn AFM is a new unit from Bosch. But
&gt; that's only if you want it to run right with no repetitive trial and error
&gt; guesswork.

Tim,

That unit new costs almost 400 dollars. If all that has been done (in the
past) is adjusting up the spring tension, a good engine tuner with a dyno
and engine analyzer can fix it. You don't need the VW specs (at RPM's other
than idle) to tell if the combustion is good.
