Subject: RE: [T2] 73 to FI, Smooth Move

&quot;Snoopy
*OK I just got a 78 FI standard 2 L engine and want to put it in my 73.
*It looks like everything came with the engine except the brain for the FI
*that is attached to engine.
____________________________________________________________

Right On! I am with you. I have a '77 so it is less of a problem with 
location of the brain.

______________________________________________________________
*What else might I need.
*Where have other people mounted the brain?
______________________________________________________________

1. Patience
2. Bracket for Air Filter Box
3. Decelerator Valve
4. Kombi Relay
5. Resistor Unit

Anything else should be listed here.
