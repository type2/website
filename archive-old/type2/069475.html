Subject: Yankee bus invades the South! (Part I long)

Hi folks,

I'm back from a fun-filled ten day adventure through the South!  Originally
the plan was to visit a friend in North Carolina and spend a week camping in
the Carolinas.  In the end, we completed a 3,435 mile round trip from
Connecticut through the beautiful South and into New Orleans and back again
in our homey, reliable '71 Westy.

We left Friday, July 19 after much last minute packing.  That morning we
installed a rear hatch window seal.  I had removed the old, dry seal and the
window on Wednesday to remove the rust and rustoleum the sill.  The window
eventually went back in fine, but no thanks to me.  Lajiri, my fiancee,
ended up figuring out how to install the window after I stared at it,
frustrated and puzzled.  It was our first window installation and once she
figured out it would be a good idea to wrap the string around the seal
channel a couple times it was a cinch to compress the seal and pull the lip
over the channel.  Fortunately if one of us gets stuck solving a car problem
(usually me), the other is there to troubleshoot and straighten things out
(usually her).  With the van now watertight (heh heh), we finished stuffing
it with spare parts (including two spare tires which would come in handy
later) and camping items and pulled out onto the open road.

The drive to our friend's place in North Carolina (mostly down I-95) took
close to 14 hours thanks to some traffic in New York.  Amidst the major
domino-effect car accident in the northbound lanes we saw a highway car fire
in NY going and coming (both nonVW).  Ahhhhh, lovely New York--bye New York!
We chose to take the Pallisades Parkway through NJ to avoid the George
Washington bridge and enjoy the tree scenery along the parkway.  Our arrival
in Bynum, NC, just outside Chapel Hill, around 5 am was unceremonious: we
shut the engine down just after dipping into the driveway, and stealthily
rolled to a stop by our friend's house.  There we slept until our friend
took Buddy the wonderdog out for a walk at 9am.  Buddy, a playful black lab
mix, (who didn't hear our bus roll in the driveway hours earlier thanks to
the din of the house air conditioning) was very much alarmed at the sight of
our red bus and his frantic barking became our wake-up call.

We spent the weekend in NC, touring lovely rural Bynum and walking along the
Haw River.  Bynum is an old mill town and the houses on our friend's street
have only had running water and electricity since 1978.  One of the
neighbors told us a story about an elderly woman who rented a house in Bynum
since the Dark Ages and until she moved recently was payed a whopping rent
of $36/year.  The most famous Bynumite lives across the street from our
friend.  Clyde is an artist who is famous for making the world famous
&quot;Clyde's Critters&quot;, which are basically carved out hunks of cedar log and
miscellaneous added-on plastic bits to form animal-statue-art.  His house
has paintings of critters on the outer walls and roof, and his yard is
literally filled with his creations.  Clyde is very genial and welcomes
tourists to walk through his yard and view his art anytime--a really nice
guy and a nice, funky neighborhood.

While we were sorry to end our stay in Bynum, we had a big plan to meet with
a magistrate on monday morning and get hitched--our real reason for this
trip--and a nice surprise twist to this story!!  We figured we'll do a big
ceremony with friends one of these days, but we both liked the idea of
taking off on a roadtrip vacation and getting married.  So with little pomp
or circumstance we bought our license, swore our oath, said our goodbyes to
our friend, and hightailed it to Lousiana.  

We've always wanted to visit New Orleans, and last year when we spent time
in the Tennessee area we wanted to visit Lousiana, but ran out of time.  So
now, on the fly, we made another marathon drive from Chapel Hill, NC to New
Orleans, stopping every 400 miles or so for gas and taking shifts at the
wheel.  Our trusty 1600cc engine with 60k miles on the bottom end and 45k on
the top performed admirably.  At every fillup I checked the dipstick and it
was hot as finger burning hell, but we pressed on carelessly, confident that
our little bus would give us this trip as our wedding gift...and it did!

We passed through Atlanta, GA at 10:30pm--so no olympic-sized traffic
hassles on I-20--and vowed to see the sights on the way back through Alabama
and perhaps stop off in Washington, D.C. at a more liesurely pace.  When we
both tired of driving in shifts we would pull off at a rest area and catch
some sleep before the next leg of our journey.  A couple VW items that
complemented the trip well were the VW-Grundig shortwave radio that Michael
Heron sold me and our newly installed VDO clock.  The shortwave kept us in
touch with the olympics and other news around the world, so the further we
drove away from home, the smaller the world felt as we tuned in to radio
Netherlands, BBC and of course radio Deutschevela (sp).  And there's nothing
like relying on an original VDO clock in a German car for the time ;-). It
was at a KOA outside New Orleans that we decided to spend the night with
showers and a swimming pool, and hit the famous French Quarter the next day.  
Unbeknownst to us, what lurked at our campsite was a confederate army of
Lousiana ants that saw their chance to attack some yankee tourists.  While
that night's sleep went well, in the morning as I began packing our
makeshift awning I noticed a steady stream of ants climbing one of the
awning poles, marching across the awning, and disappearing under the front
door gasket.  When I opened the front passenger door, to my horror, I saw
the invasion was nearly complete!  The whole underside of the front mat was
infested with at least 4 regiments of the ant army and they were using the
cover of the dark red carpet to move reserves up the lines toward the
cooler.  The carnage that followed is too horrific a story to tell--as I
mercilessly crushed every soldier in sight.  The remaining holdouts would
get their revenge on me later, though. Somehow Lajiri went unscathed through
the whole ordeal.  The ants knew their real enemy and despite further
extermination efforts I was left with battle scars from the renegade ants
who attacked me later on our journey back through Alabama.  Those Lousiana
ants are tough cookies!

Hope this isn't too long for y'all--I'm having fun remembering and I'm
really excited about planning your next road trip.  Stay tuned for part deux
of our trek through the south and the further adventures of our fiery red 71
westy!
