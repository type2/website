Subject: RE: [T2] stuck driveshaft

Have you whacked the CV with a rubber mallet or block of wood? Its probably
just stuck. I'm surprised that you can't find a convenience store or gas
station that doesn't have a kerosene pump. 
Any auto parts store or even a Wal-Mart type store should sell gallon jugs
of degreaser.
