And if this is the case, be prepared to get some of the bolts out with 
vise grips. Applying anything other than a triple square to a triple 
square bolt is lethal, and DPOs are drawn to lethal tactics like moths 
to flames.

Be sure to replace all the bolts with triple square bolts. Don't be 
your bus's next DPO.
