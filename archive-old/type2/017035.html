Subject: Busses &amp; Bikes &amp; Bus tires

Hi all,

It being Friday, I feel secure in posing the following question/comment:

I have noticed in the signatures of numerous posts, that many Type 2
drivers are also vintage/classic BMW motorcycle riders.  It has been my
experience that similarities between the volkswagen and the
BMW motorcylce go beyond the engines, the simplicity, and the
comparative pace of motoring, and extend to the drivers' outlook on
travel, adventure and life in general.

Personally, I have three friends who drive classic volkswagens
AND classic BMW motorcycles (and nothing else!)  Attitudes of the
classic BMW folks and the classic Bus contingent seem to be very
compatible.

Thus, I would like to ask that any BMW motorcyle / VW bus pilots p-mail
me; I'd like to see just how far the correlation goes! I may compile the
anonymous results for the edification of the entire list.

&lt;begin REAL bus content&gt;

I finally bought new tires for my Bus... Michelin MX4 185R14 8-ply
reinforced, from Tire Rack.  I previously had 195-75R14 passenger car
tires of mixed cheap brands (hey, the PO put 'em on! at least all four
were the same size!), and I must concur with the opinions expressed by
many listees that the reinforced sidewalls make a world of difference in
handling!  I've had the tires since the end of December, and now that
I've had a chance to put them through their paces, I feel qualified to
comment.

The Michelins have a very nice mud and snow tread, but are not loud on
the highway and are also quite grippy on the pavement. I drove down the
Pacific Coast Highway (highway 1) to Big Sur -- lots of twists and turns
-- and the tires offered truly superior cornering.  I always wondered
why my buddy with a '66 splitty camper could take the corners so fast...
now I know his secret.  The off-road traction of these tires is very
good, as is their performance in the snow.  Haven't tried them in sand
yet; because they are narrow, I would expect to have to let quite a bit
of air out. Crosswind stability is markedly better than with the
unreinforced sidewall car tires.

If you are wondering what tires to buy for your bus, you may count me as
a vocal advocate for these tires!  You would be pleased.

&lt;/end REAL bus content&gt;

May you have a weekend of enlightend busma!
