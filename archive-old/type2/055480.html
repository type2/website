Hi all-

I can not remove the fan from my alternator core.   I even tried sticking the
alternator shaft into my vise and with a cheater trying to remove the big nut
on the fans side.  No luck.  How is this done?

I ignored the parts store advice to take it to a shop and instead spent a
couple of hours trying to get it off myself with no luck. Finally took it to
my neighborhood gas station/repair shop where the manager handed it back to me
in 30 sec after putting an air wrench to it.
