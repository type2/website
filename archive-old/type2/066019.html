Subject: Leaky oil questions'77 Westy

hey now,

well...i checked the level of my oil after my massive 'oil' leak. i didn't
notice much difference. question: if the rear engine seal was gone, would it
leak constantly? or only once the oil reached a certain pressure?

what other places could oil leak from? i haven't had a chance to really
investigate this since i'm at work. the oil didn't smell funny, like a swamp.
that's what someone suggested transmission oil smelled like.

i live about 20 miles from work. guess i'll try to make it home. i've got only
a quart and a half of oil with me, hopefully something will be open on the way.


wish me luck....
