Subject: RE: [T2] Seat Stand Mats for Westy

&gt; I have been on a search for these mats for my 76 Westy for a 
&gt; little while. The drivers side is easy to find (Wolfsburg 
&gt; West), but the rotating chair on the passenger side is quite 
&gt; different from that in this kit.
&gt; I have looked on the site as well as busdepot and gowesty...


Unfortunately it's not available. Only the ones you found at Wolfsburg
West (which we also sell) are currently repro'd. I have seen some people
use this one and patch it using pieces from their old one or a second
kit to make it look acceptable. Admittedly a rig job, but sometimes the
only alternative, given that it's hard to find a used one in better
shape than your own. :-(
