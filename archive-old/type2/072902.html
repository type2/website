Subject: jelly/jam redux

Some more info, and a thanks for the replies so far:
My friend Lewis had decided that the rear trailing arm bushings might be
mushy - that was echoed by several folks, as well as bad rear bearings
making for wobbly wheels. Rear bearings are newish, but I'll check em. How
does one check rear alignment?
I also notice that it looks like my passenger side rear sits lower than the
driver's side... wonder if that could cause/contribute? It looks like I
should relevel the rear for starters; I'll move it up an inch, too!

As for the tires: this may start another thread ;P but I was asked about
tire pressure. I have Bridgestone 603Vs.
Well, I have the rears at 60, the friont at 50. The tires are rated at
1710 lbs at 65 PSI; I know VW suggested that the tires be inflated to 40
and below, but those were passenger tires. While I have never heard of a
Bridgestone exploding like the sister Firestones, I DO know that the main
cause of tire blowouts is excessive load while underinflated; I have no
desire to be a testtube to see if a bus is 'overloading' a tire running at
half its load rating.

Opinions?
