&gt; Okay, what about all of us poor slobs with progressive setups? It seems
&gt; that one of the main drawbacks of the progressive is the lack of vaccum
&gt; ports.  Where would be a good place to put the tap for the booster hose on
&gt; this particular setup's manifold... or does it matter?

Just below the carb is the best place for the brake booster vacuum tap.
I'm not a fan of the &quot;big brass fitting&quot; approach, as the fitting extends
into the flow inside the manifold.  Better to get a piece of 1/2 tubing,
drill a 1/2 hole in the manifold, and then braze or even epoxy the tubing
in place.  After this is accomplished you can smooth the inside of the
manifold to eliminate the protruding hole.

&gt; Also, could the manifold be tapped to hook up a vaccum advance for a
&gt; dizzy?  Everything I've read says that if you use a progressive, you're
&gt; cursed with the 009. Where'd be a good place for that kinda vaccum tap?

Now, vacuum for a distributor is a different matter.  The vacuum port in
the carb isn't simply a passage to the manifold, but a passage to a
position just above the throttle butterfly.  The butterfly opening sends a
vacuum signal to the distributor to advance the spark.  If you hook the
distributor directly to the manifold vacuum it will actually work pretty
much backwards!
