Subject: chain saw blade oil undercoating

&gt; Does anyone else have input or experiences with this method.

Last fall I jacked up my bus and added 4L w/ a paintbrush.  I tried hitting
all possible area under the bus, and also in between the doors &amp; wheel wells.
It went on extremely easily and the big jug provideed enough  to give a little
shot to every nookadn cranny imageinable.

After a couple days it changed colour and you can see the rust protection
soaking in.  Now, 4 months later, I am certain this will slow or stop rust
from growing on the key areas, and I would strongly recommend this method.

I even added a couple shots of the chainsaw oil to my '87 Jetta and '93 Ford
Tempo to protect them through daily driving in a Canadian winter.  So far, so
good!

Best regards,
Shawn.
