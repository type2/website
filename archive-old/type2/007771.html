I am getting some good suggestions to my original question, but here are 
some additional clues to work with:

1. I've got blowby. That's why I checked the compression. Engine blows 
out one (old) seal after another at highways speeds. Oil everywhere, 
coating everything, on the final occurance.

2. Whoever last rebuilt this engine was no expert. Remember, the rotor 
points at #4 cylinder at TDC for cylinder #1.

So that, combined with the wet/dry difference makes me rule out 
valve/head problems, pray for rings (incompetently installed by PO or his 
rebuilder), and fear a bad piston.

I wouldn't care except that I am going to have to do a stealth 
drop-and-repair, since working with your hands is against the rules in my 
misbegotten 'neighborhood.'

Mark
