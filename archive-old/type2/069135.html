&gt;&gt;Turn engine on and I watch my brake pedal get sucked to the floor by the
brake servo.  This creates a no-can-move situation--like having the emergency
brake on.  I know the servo works on a vacuum from a line that run from it to
my intake manifold but why is it doing this?  I replaced all the braided
lines running underneath the bus so it's not caused by a leak in the line.
 When I disconnect the vacuum line at the check valve and pluged up the hose
leading to the intake manifold, my brakes work fine w/o servo.  Please, can
anyone tell me what's going on here?  Is it just a faulty check valve or is
it a serious problem with the servo?&lt;&lt;

My 73 Panel had the same thing happen to it a couple a years back.  It was
the check valve - replaced it - solved the problem.

Sounds like the check valve is bad.  Save-A-Bug there in Riverside should
have one for around $10 or lower.  Don't have their phone# but they should be
in the book.
