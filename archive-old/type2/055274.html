Subject: 1979 Westy.

Hello:

I just rebuilt the engine in a 1979 Westy 2.0 F.I.

Currently trying to set the timing after readjusting the Hydraulic valves.
Touch and turn twice, tighten the nut and your done kinda adjustment.

Then I wanted to see the difference. It starts real good but I'm
not sure why the motor has a hard time running below 2000 rpm.

According to the Ignition timing instructions for air-cooled Volkswagens.
I should be able to run at idle to set the timing.

I've lined up TDC based on the Crank pulley and Rotated the Distributor to
the
mark in the distributor body. I have a Fuel Injected Ignition system with a
solid state control unit.
Would that get me out of the &quot;setting points&quot; pre-requisite?


Thanks.
Can't wait to drive this thing again.


Michael
