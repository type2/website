Subject: Type 2 Ambulance Fan

I have a working ambulance fan for my '65 deluxe microbus.  
Since I'm finishing up the restoration of the vehicle, I thought it 
would be nice to add this little accessory now.  Only thing is the 
vehicle is 12 volt through and through and the ambulance fan 
motors are 6 volt.   I have to take both of these motors apart for 
cleaning, lubrication and to replace the wiring which has lost 
most of the insulation. So while they are apart, I like to change 
them over to 12 volt if possible.  Has anyone ever done a neat 6 to 
12 volt conversion by just modifying the motors themselves?  I 
don't want to have to wire in a volta-drop just for this.  

The motor housing has a SWF decal on it that says KVE1/6 Volt  
211 959 111.  I don't know if there is any variation in the part 
number over the years.  I have disassembled one of the motors 
and at one end there is a resistor(?) that looks like a squashed 
rolled-up newspaper that says BERU SK 406  0,4 µF 961 made in 
Germany.  Is this a resistor? and if so, can I change it to some 
other resistor that would make it operate properly in a 12 volt 
system?
