Subject: Re: test your injectors!

List:

Just thought I'd pass on an interesting site that deals with injector
cleaning, flow-testing, blueprinting, etc.  They did a set for my last
rebuild (&quot;blueprinted&quot;, patter and flow-matched to 2%) on a '78 2 liter.
It really did provide a smoother idle, smoother acceleration and perhaps
a little better mileage on the highway.  Couldn't tell a lot of mpg 
difference in primarily city driving.  No relationship to vendor, YMMV, etc.:

You can buy new injectors directly from him in &quot;matched&quot; sets.  Or he
can clean, rebuild and match old injectors.  

Hope this helps,
