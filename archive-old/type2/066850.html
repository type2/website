Subject: RE: Bug muffler on '71 bus? Need quick yes/no

The mufflers for the bug and bus are the same, except for the tail
pipes; the bug muffler has two that stick straight out, while the bus
muffler only has one, and it drops down and to the side. The Idiot's
Guide says that you have to trim some metal off the rear apron sheet
metal in order to fit the bug tailpipes, but I've got a bug muffler on
my '71 and the apron looks unchanged. Maybe only the earlier model buses
needed the rear apron changes.

Take a look at you're rear engine brace, though. My rear engine brace
has been modified (not specifically for a bug muffler, but for a whole
bug engine), so you'll want to make sure that the standard brace won't
get in the way. I'm guessing that the brace won't be a problem.
