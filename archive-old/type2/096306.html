I have always used a chain fall to hold up the tranny when needed.  sling
chain between holes in the frame under the center of tranny and LOCK it
firmly in place, I usually put a bolt thru two of the chain links making a
loop around the block so it cannot fall.  leaves entire area under bus
free for working on engine removal.
