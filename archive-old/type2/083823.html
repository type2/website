I'm not too sure of this. A pump curve is for most normal pumps gives
us this data: as pressure goes up flow goes down. Which in effect
causes a pump to be able to only pump out a certain volume at a
particular pressure. If the pump is defective is very well might pump
the required volume w/ no pressure on the pressure side, but fail
miserably when required to pump a volume w/ a pressure. Plus we aren't
taking water pumps here, but fuel pumps. I don't like giving anyone
advice which essentially says run that electric fuel pump into a
bucket &amp; hope something bad doesn't happen w/ that liquid bomb.

&gt; The only way to verify what happens past there is with the pressure
&gt; gauge, but how 'bout this? Instead of spending the money on a
&gt; pressure gaugue first, replace your fuel lines and see what happens
&gt; then. If that doesn't work, you know your pumps good, you know your
&gt; lines are clear, check injector spray pattern, THEN get the pressure
&gt; gauge to check the pressure regulator (or swap in a known good one).

No. While replacing fuel lines is a must for any bus you don't know
the history of, Diagnose then replace is the way to go. All he would
know is that he has new hoses, while this is a good thing he has no
idea of the condition of the pump, or any restrictions in the lines
that he can't replace.
