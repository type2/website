Subject: economical cruising

	A given cruising speed  -  say, 65 mph  -  uses considerably 
less fuel if approached 'from above': float down onto that speed 
gently from a slightly higher speed, rather than the more 'natural' 
method of climbing up onto it from below.

	I used this method to good effect in driving home about 200 
mi on my Renault 1108cc with no muffler (from a town where no spare 
muffler could be found).  The muffler had become almost completely 
detached at its entrance, leaving essentially a 9&quot; pipe from the 
exhaust manifold and little else, so it sounded like a machine gun. 
To get thru small towns I would enter at about 60 with the motor 
idling in neutral, and with any luck cruise out the far end at about 
20.  On the highway I found that if I approached 65 mph from below 
and drove steadily at that speed the machine-gun sound was very loud 
and likely to attract police attention, whereas if I got up to 70 and 
then floated down gently onto 65 it was scarcely louder than when the 
muffler had been connected.   We can safely assume less fuel was 
being consumed in this cruise mode.
	This apparently reflects some deficiency in typical carbs.

	(I can't comment on FI except that my wife's diesel (2L 
uncharged Nissan) sounds considerably quieter when cruised this way, 
and attains 53 mpg.)
