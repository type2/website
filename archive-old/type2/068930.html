Subject: Re: '80 vanagon westfalia: charging system 

Several useful suggestions have come in, which I'll be checking out.
Here's a variant on the symptoms, which is leading me off in another
direction entirely:

Did a short drive from work to the video store, and had the somewhat-
expected yellow light when I stopped, and it was still yellow when I
left.  I then went from there to a restaurant for dinner (about the
same distance as the previous drive).  Green light when stopped, and
still green when getting in to go home.

This leads me to suspect a loose wire somewhere, probably in the
vicinity of the engine compartment.  This is based on the tightness of
the connectors on both the previous and current batteries, and that I
can hear a difference in starter speed that correlates to the lights
(i.e., it really is getting low when there's a yellow light).

This ought to be exciting, as it'll be my first Vanagon engine
compartment expedition.  It sure is different from my '66....
