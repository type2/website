Subject: Re: [T2] Gas Smell

Do you have thin rubber lines going from the tank to an expansion tank?  
possibly a tank on each side.  If so these hoses can rot through and not 
be noted.  Not easy to replace either.  Had that problem on mine.  Not 
sure if a 72 would have the same lines.  Also a corrupted charcoal 
cannister can do the same.
