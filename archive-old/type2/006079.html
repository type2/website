&gt; thanks to all of you who answer my question about timing a 2000cc
&gt; engine.
&gt; I found the sticker with the tune up specs on the engine compartment. It
&gt; says 5 atdc.

That is ONLY if you have the wrong dual vacuum unit dist or a 79 Cal version
electronic ignition w/dual vacuum unit. Other than a 79 Cal, ALL 2.0L came
with a single vacuum advance that timed at 7.5 before.

&gt; Now I'm not sure if the engine of my recently bought '75 transporter is
&gt; a 2000cc or a 1800 cc ...

A 75 with a dual vacuum unit and a timing reference to 5 after should be a
ED engine code 1800.
Another thing to look at is the cylinder head temp sensor position/location.
If it is mounted right next to #3 intake runner and you can see it, it is a
2.0 head. If it mounts above #3 intake port and the wire comes thru a hole
in the upper tin, it is a 1800 head.

&gt; I was trying to locate the engine serial number but I couldn't see any.
&gt; Where is stamped?

On top of the case between the fan housing and vent box on a 2.0L.  Do not
go by the number stamped in the fan housing.

&gt; Is there any physical difference between a 2000cc and the 1800 cc&gt;? any
&gt; way to tell them apart?

No, you would need to disassemble the engine and measure. 1700, 1800, and
2.0 cases are interchangeable. The only difference on the outside is the
mechanical fuel pump mounting on the right front corner. 1700 and 1800
carbed engines have the pump. 1800 FI and 2.0 has the cast boss but no
holes.
