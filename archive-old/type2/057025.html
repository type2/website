Hi Volks,

George Crawford &lt;gcrawfor_at_altair.csustan_dot_edu&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt;   Rented a move called 'Killing Time'.  The killers spend
&gt; most of their time in a light blue VW bus.  It's set in
&gt; England so the interior reflects the change.  I thought it
&gt; was funny when the bus was tailing their target.  How can
&gt; you not notice a bus behind you for miles?

Well, this is not America.  ;-)

I wouldn't notice a Vanagon following me from here to Munich - 
they're common.  The only reason why I wouldn't feel good about 
following a car with a Vanagon here is keeping up with them. :-)

Yours,
    Erik.

There are many good cars available for $10k today - e.g., 4-5 VW buses.
