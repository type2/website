Subject: Re: [T2] welding under body parts?

&gt; Hi all - Would like some advice on welding the parts underneath the bus, like 
&gt; the jack supports, sliding door runner, and rocker panels.  (Been searching 
&gt; the archives, and am considering trying it myself.)  All I need doing is the 
&gt; actual welding repairs, the finish work I can take care of with my 
&gt; brother-in-law.  I guess my questions are, (1) What's the going rate to get 
&gt; the above parts repaired at a repair shop?,

more than you can afford, if you can find anyone to do it...figure $25-50
an hour, lots of hours

&gt; and (2) Is it something I could  try to do myself? 

probably, if I can do it most anyone can

&gt; I've worked on my own cars for years, but never with any 
&gt; welding or body repairs.  Thanks very much for any suggestions you can give 
&gt; me.  Larry

pick up a small MIG welding set up (I like the Lincoln Weld Pac 100 for
beginning) get the MIG adapter and a tank of Argon/CO2 gas.  also I think
the best thing I have bought was one of those outragously expensive auto
darkening helmets

then get some scrap materiel and practice, practice...
