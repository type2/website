&gt; here is the vin # in the window: 2262060517
&gt; The other code I gave you was off the plate behind the seat too.

Well, the dash came from a 76.......
What number is on the ''title''??
What number is stamped in the left rear corner of the engine compartment??
Is it cut out??
If it is....I would run from this bus.
