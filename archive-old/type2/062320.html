Subject: 78 FI cold start/idle

Hey Volx,

Does this problem sound familiar to anyone: When I start my 78 FI bus,
it runs at higher RPM just for a few seconds, then starts to settle
down to idle (normal so far).  However, the RPMs just keep dropping
until the bus almost stalls.  It will usually catch &quot;just before the
last revolution&quot; and come back up to a normal idle, but sometimes it
does stall.

If, before starting, I press on the accelerator, or if I give it gas
before the idle settles down, it will always stall.  The only options
are to not touch the accelerator AT ALL until the idle stabilizes, or
keep my foot on the accelerator constantly till the engine warms up
a little.

Where do I start to diagnose this annoying not-quite-yet-a-problem?
Is a full tune-up the first step, or is there a little something out
of adjustment somewhere that causes this symptom?

Rodney
