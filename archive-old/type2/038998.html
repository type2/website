Subject: For Sale: Fiberglass hightop and 70 deluxe and/or parts

As unfortunate as it may seem, the time has arrived for my 70 to part from 
me.  It currently lacks an engine and tranny but if someone wants to put it 
back together.  I can come up with the parts for it.  Otherwise June 1st I 
will be having a party with to disect the parts and decent body parts.  I 
live in the midwest so the bus has the usual rust.  If you need any parts 
email me.  The fiberglasss hightop is from a 68 adventure camper, I was 
planning on making a camper out of the 70 but have too much crap going on 
in the forseeable future.  The bus and top are currently located outside 
Iowa City, Iowa.  I have the cabinets that go to the hightop too if you are 
interested.  I'm asking $40 for the top but you'll have to come get it or 
arrange to get it (not really practical to ship it - although if you really 
want to........).   Price for the 70 depends on what you want.  Email me at 
jjmnoble_at_msn_dot_com or call (319) 627-4948 if you want/need anything.
