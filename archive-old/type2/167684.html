&gt; The only question now is about re-installing the rings. I didn't mark
&gt; them when I took it apart and I don't know for certain which ring
&gt; goes to which groove. When I took the engine apart I found the rings
&gt; were tight on #1 and #2 piston; I have heard this is not uncommon on
&gt; this engine. I  was hoping that the cleaning would fix this but it
&gt; doesn't seem to be the case.
&gt;
&gt; Do I need new rings, or do I need to have a machine shop open up the
&gt; grooves a bit?

rings are cheap, I would definately get new ones.
