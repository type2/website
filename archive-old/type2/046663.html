Subject: Re: [T2] touch up paint

&gt; hi i am down here in australia, i have a 74 kombi that is the factory
&gt; orange. Anyway tell me how to get some touch up paint?

You could try the VW dealer. Perhaps they still have it, it has been a
pretty common colour in the seventies, even in the early eighties I
think. Otherwise you can try a shop that sells car paint and ask if they
can look up the VW color and reproduce it for you. This must be the data
on the color:

German name:	Leuchtorange
English:	Brilliant orange
Paint code:	L20B

If you want to be sure about the type of color you can check behind your
drivers seat. There should be a sticker with the name of the color,
otherwise you can look it up on the metal plate...uhm, did I say
&quot;drivers seat&quot;? I see you probably live in Australia, then read
&quot;passenger seat&quot; instead of &quot;drivers seat&quot;.
