Subject: oooooooh, I'm excited!

Well, I finally sat down and pulled the case apart and completely 
disassembled my broken engine with the burnt piston #4.  Yesterday I 
brought it away to rimco and now it's in their hands.  They're going to 
align bore the case, fix the crank, clean up the heads, and i'm getting 
new pistons and cylinders.  This has be a really slow project.  hmmm... 
almost two years now!  Now I just have to wait patiently and hope that 
the case is good for the boring.  They said that the #4 bearing seat was 
a little funky so they're going to see what they can do....

keeping fingers crossed!
