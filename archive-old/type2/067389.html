Subject: Rescue this van. Vote.

        Quite a metaphor there Randall- :)

        I'd be willing to contribute $20 to rescue this van, no matter
which candidate wins. 

        Remember to VOTE Tuesday. If you don't vote, you've got
NO right to complain about the outcome. Voters can complain for free!
People are fighting and dying for the rights we take for granted
EVERY DAY. I too would rather people voted against me than didn't vote.
