The best thing for you will probably be to get the heads done.  
Putting a 2.0 will require much more funds to include all the peices 
beyond the long block.  Exhaust,intake (2.0 has FI)  The darn 
exhaust can put ones bank account in sad shape alone.

It can be done,  without too many pains.
My own opinion.

&gt; I have a '72 with the orignal pancake engine in.  My cyl. heads need to be
&gt; replace but I was thinking of putting in a Rebuilt 2.0.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 1) Is this a good idea in the long run or will I save more money by just
&gt; re-doing the heads?
