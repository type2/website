Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pump for type IV Whose to Use

&gt; good I say. So then looked at Bus Depot, been pretty happy with Ron's
&gt; stuff. They list a Melling Pump for about $70.00. More than twice the pump
&gt; at Aircooled_dot_net but which one should I use? I like the idea of spending
&gt; $30 over $70, but I want the better pump too. Any help here in making this

I have the Melling on my rebuilt 2L ENGINE 

&gt; idea what that is all about? I am getting low oil pressure when the bus
&gt; warms up at idle. Say 10-15 lbs at idle when oil temps are at 210-225.
&gt; Strong pressure on startup 60lbs. Running at 65-70mph when temps are in the
&gt; 210-225 range I get about 25-30lbs sometimes less. I say thats not so good?

25k miles or so on the rebuild and the oil presure starts at 60 doesn't go
below 25-30 at hot idle and will pump at least 50 at 55mph and 230temp,  I
don't let it get much over that if I can help it...will slow to 55mph at
240 and pull over and let it cool down (at fast idle) at 250, which has
not ever happened yet.

some of the folks at everybus saw my guage when I was there so can vouch
for the readings

now I think the key to all this was the guy helping me rebuild the engine
honed the guage in before installing it in the engine, oh and I run 15W-50
weight synthetic Mobil 1 in the engine
