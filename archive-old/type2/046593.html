Subject: Re: [T2] Westy Shower

[...]

I've seen the Eurovan showers at shows, but never in use so don't know just
how elaborate they are.

We've used a couple of SunShowers for years, on our old boat and Westy
camping in the deep boonies.  They are inexpensive, durable, and most
importantly they actually work .  We've actually been in situations where
they got a bit _too_ hot, and had to cool them down a little before
showering.

The 10 gal. size does fine for 2 people, and a pair of that size are
downright luxurious.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Can someone tell me where I could buy a new or used shower like the one
found as an option in the newer Westies?  &lt;&lt;
