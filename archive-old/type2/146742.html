Subject: re: brakes?

One of my front wheels was recently draging also. I replaced the calipers, the rubber hoses (all 4 while I was at it), the pads, and took the rotors to a gas station to have them turned. The wheels turn freely now. I didn't replace any metal lines. This is also a good chance to inspect the bearings and replace the grease seals.

Good Luck,

 So I took off the
wheels to see if one was dragging. The front left wheel was first and I could
not even turn it my hand.... So I took the tire off and it looked like the
brake was binding.
