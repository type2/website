Subject: Temporary remedy for missing studs?

So I finally found a source for the tranny mounting studs I was
missing.  I planned on using these to mount the engine to my engine
stand.  HOWEVER, they are backordered =(.  I don't see them arriving
before this weekend and I would really like to get my engine up on the
stand so I can tear into it and see what kind of shape it's in.  Would
it be possible to use a 10mmx1.5 bolt and cut the head off and use
that to mount the engine to the stand?  Do I run the risk of damaging
the case?  Would the bolt be strong enough?  Naturally I'd use the
proper studs when they arrived to attach the engine to the tranny.
Thanks in advance for your help, I'd really like to get moving on this
ASAP (but safely of course)
