Subject: Buster's New Bits

Hello List,

Well Buster is actually starting to take shape. Thanks to a very nice 
fellow named Bill Harris formerly of Arizona, Buster has all new 
cabinetry including Sink, Stove and Fridge as well as a bed frame. The 
laminate is peeling off but the frame and wood is in fantastic shape. I 
have started peeling off the laminate to re-laminate it. I went to Home 
Depot yesterday and talked to them about laminates, picked some samples 
and I feel fairly confident I can do this job. We'll see if I am crying 
to the lists for help :) I'll be putting pics up on the web site soon.

Buster was towed on Saturday to an RV storage facility, where he will 
sit for a couple months while I save up for a new engine. Got a pretty 
good quote. $1500 for the engine and $495 for labor. Sounds a lot better 
than the $4,000 I was quoted before just to replace the heads. I am 
going to search through the archives to see what engines are good and 
what engines to avoid, so I can be better informed. I believe I have 
read to stay away from GEX. I found out I have a Type 4 engine. I know 
what a Longblock is and I am sorta ok on the definition of a stroker. Oh 
and I know what turnkey is too. I am learning! :)

The only problem I had was on Saturday after we dropped Buster off at 
his new home (sandwiched between a full-size Partridge family bus and a 
5th wheel) we were discussing how I was going to get the stuff in the 
bus with the sliding door not working. So we had this bright Idea. My 
girlfriend got inside the bus and I stood outside and we tried to pull 
the door open. The back part towards the rear popped out but the front 
part was stuck. So I said &quot;hip-check it hard and maybe the front will 
pop loose&quot; so she hit it hard with her hip and the whole door dropped 
into the dirt. I imagine we looked pretty silly, two girls standing in a 
deserted storage yard with our mouths hanging open and dumb looks on our 
faces. :) We spent another 1/2 hour struggling to put it back in place. 
It's hanging there precariously, but from outward appearances at least 
you wouldn't really know that the door isn't attached. Unless of course 
a stiff wind comes by and knocks it loose. So this weekend I will be 
spending time with my manuals, and the door, trying to figure out how 
it's supposed to work first and then why it isn't working. Wish me luck.

Sherri
