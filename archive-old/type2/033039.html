Subject: starting my 79

I have new problem.  When I start my stock, 2.0l FI, 79 bus in the morning I
now have to give it a little gas.  Every FI bus I have ever started that was
in good condition started with no use of the gas pedal when it was cold.
Everything was fine until this last Sunday.  I started getting a high pitch
whine from the rear of the bus that was a constant pitch whirring sound.
Did not change in relation to RPM, gear selection, speed, or clutch
engagement.  Did this for a couple of hours then went away.  Monday morning
I wakeup &amp; bus does not start without the gas pedal slightly depressed.  Any
ideas?
