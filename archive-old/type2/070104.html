Subject: RE: HEAT CAUSE

&gt; This thread makes me go all Sam Kinison:  You want to know what makes 
&gt; something hot?  FIRE!  Fire makes things hot!  Thousands of explosions
&gt; per minute will make you warm!

Go get 'em Sam! But personally, I think it's those damned tires making the
car hot. You know, the heat from the asphalt radiates up through the
tires, into the axles, and then on to the engine, causing it to overheat.
That's why I try to stay off the paved roads as much as possible.

Check out the &quot;Heat of Combustion&quot; experiment at:

Do the experiment, then please report back to the list. Don't forget to
wear safety goggles! 

If you're really still interested in this thread, please stop reading
now! Don't page down, whatever you do!



















- ---&gt; These guys are really getting carried away, but the experiment I'm
sending them is pretty complex, requires lots of expensive equipment, and
should keep them busy for a couple of weeks, even though it really has
nothing to do with the original question...or aircooled VWs.

OBVW: they'll probably need their buses to gather up all the equipment.

I'm holding to my own theory until Bob Hoover throws his hat in the ring!
Joe &quot;It's Friday in my Mind&quot; Fournier.
