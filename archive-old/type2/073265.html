&gt;&gt;And when all threads are
&gt;&gt;lubed w/ anti-seize, I have a better chance of getting meaningful torque
&gt;&gt;readings.  I just put a brand new set of factory 16&quot; alloys on my T100
&gt;&gt;truck, and I sure wanted these megabuck wheels to be properly torqued.
&gt;
&gt;Possibly not. Torque specs are generally intended for dry threads, and
&gt;slippery lubricants are fairly difficult ( i.e. impossible ) to spec for that.
&gt;Chances are you have more pressure than you would like on those wheels.


Yes, I may have a bit more pressure, but I think I have more *uniform*
pressure than if I take my chances with the dry threads, which are bound to
vary in their levels of corrosion and roughness.  Lubing them helps to
reduce the differences, IMHO.
