Thank you for the tips, I checked the plugs, fond 1 loose, which didn't 
solve the problem, but seemed to make it much happier running on all 4. 
Then to follow up on the vacuum suggestion I took a gander at Richard 
Atwell's excellent hose diagrams and found a few missing components as 
well as some completely in incorrect places (it's a wonder it ran to 
begin with). After a short trip to the parts store for some hose she 
farts like a kitten.

Again my thanks,
-Andrew

&gt; What do your plugs look like? Sounds like the mixture is off, possibly
&gt; from vacuum leaks. The first few seconds the computer richens the
&gt; mixture. The AAR is also fully open only for a few seconds before it
&gt; starts closing. Those things could be compensating for a very lean
&gt; condition.
