Subject: New Acquisition

All:
        Some may remember, we had signed on asking for advice on a 
welder
for the 59 pass thru we were buying. Things have changed. We dropped
that deal and picked up a 67 that doesn't need half the work, for
the same price. This leads me to two things.
        First, the original bus still exists, a rather beat up but 
possible
project. The pass-thru had the engine in pieces on the cargo floor,
and a very dented roof. Underneath, rust was present, but not overly
so. However, due to the extra layer of sheetmetal, the state of the
frames was not obvious. Due to its age and rarity, it is a likely
candidate for the motivated. Title may be a problem, I did not
finish pursuing this when I found the 67. I also know of a stripped
shell WITH title nearby. IF at all possible, I'd like to see either
of these spared from the crusher.
        Second, we are trying to identify our new purchase. The VIN 
starts
with 287, so it left the factory as a 7 passenger. However, it has a
poptop (square) and some other strangenesses. In the luggage area,
what I assume was the spare tire well was cut out and covered by a
purpose stamped plate. The clam was ground off, and both areas were
painted with a varnish like substance, as were a few other points in
the cvehicle, including the mid- and back-seat mounts. The two front
seats are high back buckets, probably installed by a PO, but the
passenger seat is on a rather beefy swivel. The interior is
stripped, but there are panels on the walls, and original looking
&quot;styrofoam&quot; insulation behind. The headliner changes subtly forward
of the luggage area.
        My Question: is this a one-time Westy? Or some other 
conversion
that has been changed by some PO? We would really appreciate your
professional advice on this, to guide our restoration.
        The most amazing/strange thing: somebody had installed a VDO 
water
temp guage in the dash!(probably hooked up to a dipstick oil
temperature sender. We can't tell, most of the engine compartment
wiring was consumed in a light engine fire)
