Subject: Re: [T2] Taco grief

Man, all this talk of Tacos is making me hungry.

I had that same problem and I ended up replacing the gasket. I guess I got lucky that time, but it wasn't much. I believe I got it (along with some other items) from the Bus Depot.

&gt; 
&gt; &quot;It just requires a little futzing to keep things centered as you  
&gt; gently persuade the red ring to expand against the case hole as it  
&gt; rolls around the bevelled edge of the taco plate. If it goes crokked,  
&gt; back off a bit on the 10mm bolts and go at it again.  Colin&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck with it!
