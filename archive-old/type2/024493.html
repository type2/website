Greetings Friendly List Volks*

  Today we are going to try to get Ramona's new (NEW! As in &quot;still in the 
original box&quot;!!) 8track car stereo installed! I am NOT inclined when it comes 
to electrical stuff, so I have a coupla questions for you pro's before I 
start shocking myself.
  All I have is the owner's manual which only briefly tells you how to do 
this. This stereo must have been one of the last models made since it has a 
digital face with clock and channel display for the radio!
  Here's what it says:
    RED LEAD (fused): Connect to &quot;Accessory&quot; terminal of fuse block.
    BLUE LEAD: If car is equipped w/ automatic antenna, connect to antenna 
power relay.
    YELLOW LEAD: Connecting to vehicle's instrument panel illumination 
circuit will allow you to control the brightness of the radio digital display 
with the instrument panel control. (huh?)
    BLUE/WHITE STRIPE LEAD: This lead is for the digital clock, and MUST be 
connected to a terminal which will supply 12 volts continuously even w/ the 
ignition switched off. One such terminal is the +positive terminal of the car 
battery. Another source is the &quot;hot&quot; side of the ignition car switch.
  GROUND: Yayyyy! THIS one, I understand! Sad, yes?
  Basically, I don't even know where to connect. The ends of all of these 
wires are bare, no push-on's or anything, except the power lead which is 
push-on. Do these literally go into the same space in the fuse block as the 
wires that are already there?? They share the same hole? And the BLUE/White 
lead has to run all the way to the battery??? Outside the van? Or the 
ignition switch? I *do* have two &quot;extra&quot; wires dangling from my switch which 
I'd replaced a few years ago...maybe they can be of use here? Or, no?
  Anyways, this may seem VERY stupid to ya'll and if so, I apologize, but 
really appreciate any help you can offer. The last perm I had was about 20 
years ago, and I did NOT like looking like Little Orphan Annie!!!
THANKS, THANKS!!
