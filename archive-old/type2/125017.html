Subject: DA sander etc

OK,
I obviously did something wrong while treating the rust around my
windshield prior to replacement with the POR15, probably waited too long
to apply the primer.  I thought I had to wait til it was dry but still
could dent with fingernail.  That was longer than 4 hours, I thought due
to cool evening last night.  No matter...the result was the crackle
effect without buying crackle paint!
My plan is to buy a DA sander, probably from Home Depot($49.99 and
they're a 1/4 mile from my house) and some sandpaper and buzz off all
the primer and take the sheen off the POR15 and reapply primer and paint
before installing the replacement. 
1.  Anyone know of a screaming deal on a DA sander that is likely of
better quality than what I'll get at HD?
2.  What grit sandpapers should I purchase for this task?  
	Rust removal
	Taking off primer
	Scuffing up the por15
3.  What is the current consensus on adding a sealer in the grooves of
the windshield?  There used to be recommendations of roofing tar etc but
I was always worried that it would bleed out in the summer sun.
thanks in advance for any and all advice/experiences.
