Chris Andersen sends:

&gt; I am recently new to this list, and recently purchased a sweet 83 Westy.
&gt; All is well, except that ive noticed an occaisonal loud high pitched sound
&gt; coming from what i think is passenger side rear of vehicle, when i make
&gt; SHARP turns to the right.
&gt; Anybody have an idea to what this might be?  Have i over cranked the wheel
&gt; past some point that it doesn't like? Or is trouble lurking???

Sounds (pun intended) like a CV joint.
