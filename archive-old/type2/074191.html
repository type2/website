Subject: VW Heidelberg Radio Wiring - Need Help

Dear Volks,

I recently acquired a VW Heidelberg radio but didn't get the plug with
the wires for the back.  I want to put it in my new to me '86 Vanagon
Weekender.  I plan to wire each terminal one at a time since I don't 
have a plug. There is a label on the radio, but I'm not sure of what most
of the pin outs are for.  Would someone who has one please look at 
your radio and give me a little help.  The diagram shows:

Top row, top plug, left to right (looking at the back of the radio):

Pin 1 - scratched, can't read

Pin 2 - symbol of speaker with a plus sign

Pin 3 - looks like a Y superimposed on an I 

Pin 4 - + sign - must be the positive connection - is this one
always on or switched?

Bottom row, left to right:

Pin 1 - scratched, can't read

Pin 2 - letter S

Pin 3 - looks like a sun or light symbol - circle with rays coming out
of it

Pin 4 - minus sign inside a circle

Guess all I really need are the negative, switched positive and always
on positive.  The speaker terminals are labeled.  I would like to do it 
right and need to know what all are for.

Thanks,

David Hunt
