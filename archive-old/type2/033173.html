Subject: sunsceen dimensions....

Would any listees who are in possession of one of those fab' sunscreens on
their bay window, possibly be able to supply me with the rough dimensions as
come the new year I'd like to attempt to build one myself ( too darn
expensive a luxury when you've got a family to finance )...........
.....any advice on the subject would be very appreciated
Garp ( and family )
