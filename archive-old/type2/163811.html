Subject: Is my Brake Booster Core good?

So I got a new brake booster.   I got the old one but I have missed my
window for my core deposit(c'est la vie).
I'd like to spread the love and ship it to a fellow lister in exchange for a
list donation but dont know how to tell if my core is rebuildable or not.
Rather than ship them junk. I'd like to at least check it out first.  Tried
searching the list (brake booster core and various permutations there of but
no luck.

Looking for a few &quot;warning signs&quot;

-Zach
