My guess as to the best way would be to take a VW Bus from here down to
brasil and &quot;rebuild&quot; your Bus with all the Brasilian parts, or swap vins.
plates, and all. If you did this, I would get the thing very dirty, add lots
of US type stickers, and maybe even install a Westy pop top and US doors to
make it look US as apposed to Brasilian. The biggest external changes to the
Brasilian Bus are the front doors and the roof. You may want to swap your US
bumper on also. 
  You would be doing almost the same thing as BeetleMex does to ship
New(old) Beetles into the US.
  In short, it would be completely ILLEAGAL, but I do not thing if done
right anyone would notice. You would want to temporarily make the new Bus,
look like an old US spec Bus so they would not do any further checking.
Secondly, you would have to drive it over the border into the US. Maybe even
go with a group of Buses so your new one just &quot;fits in&quot;.
  Good Luck.
