Sorry, according to the Yokohama site (my search was breif but...), they do 
not carry this tire for a 14 inch rim (Vanagon stock).


&gt;On the Jeep, I put on Yokohama Geolander H/T's, which, I found out later, 
&gt;are one of the highest rated light truck tires on the market, and in my 
&gt;experience, deservedly so.  They have great ride quality, are quiet, don't 
&gt;hydro-plane, have good grip,

and will probably be the ones I put on my bus when I need new tires.

I dont think they make em!
