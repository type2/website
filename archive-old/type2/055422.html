&gt; I'm not surprised that your bus leaks.  Stock '71 buses break when they're 
&gt; driven at 70 MPH for long periods.  If you need to drive 70 you should get 
well,

I drive my bus at an indicated speed of 70 mph everywhere.  I drive it at
that speed in texas in the summer and in saint louis in the winter.

Since bus speedometers are consistently optimistic i doubt either myself
or our friend are going an actual 70 but its probably pretty close.

And before you say i'll cause my engine to die an untimely death, i have
over 65 thousand miles on a rebuild.  I did it myself and its done
well.  I havent had to really touch it other than standard maintenance
items and fiddling with the acessories (carb etc.)

So, from my perspective, you are dead wrong.

take care,

Steve
