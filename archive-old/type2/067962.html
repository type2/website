Subject: VW sighting in Patagonia catalog

Another Friday bit 'o' fluff.

I know folks keep an eye out for busses in movies, TV, and ads. One of
the funny things is that the media people sometimes get things wrong,
like using a late seventies bus in a story set in the sixties.

I found a weird one in an older Patagonia catalog the other day. People
who buy Patagonia clothing take pictures of themselves doing cool stuff
like climbing mountains and roping horses. The company publishes some of
the best shots as illustrations in their catalog. In the catalog I saw
recently, there was a large picture of a young guy pulling the engine
from a '71 bus. The caption said something about changing the front seal
and gland nut. It also mentioned that he's wearing the plaid wool shirt
advertised on the same page.

The price of the shirt is about $50.

That must be one very clean engine!
