Subject: Is there a 72 singlecab?

I need to buy a pickup truck soon so I can haul sheets of plywood
and other house remodeling materials.  My first choice would be a
72 Single Cab to go with my 72 Campmobile.  Is there such a
thing.  I'm thinking that engine and body parts would be
exchangeable between the two so that I could always be assured
that one or the other was driveable.  Right now my Campmobile is
a daily driver.
If there is no such thing as a 72 Single Cab I'm open to any
other reasonable suggestion.

Thanks
