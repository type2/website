Subject: Re: [T2] Questions? And CarFax

&gt; You know those orange reflectors on your doors that don't light up?
&gt; The little bulbs in the upper front lights are the side marker 
&gt; lights. They light up
&gt; at the same time as the red rear side markers. they come on when you 
&gt; turn your 
&gt; lights on.

Oooh! Ok....

&gt; Nah....you don't need them. VW wasted time and money putting them on 
&gt; every engine!
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, you should have them.


Thanks Karl...

     Yeah, a lot of people told me I didn't really need the bottom ones,
but I wanted to make sure because it did seem odd to me. I asked simply
because mine doesn't have them yet, so I wanted to know if I actually
needed to buy them. My motor was a GEX rebuild, but whoever put the motor
back in forgot nearly all the tin work. I'm also a bit bummed.. it seems
as if they re-used a LOT of parts. My pushrod tubes are rusty as hell....
I'm debating on whether or not I should try to remove them, sand them
down and paint them, or just hit them with some sort of rust converter
spray?! At the very least, I have those small pieces of tin directly
above the pushrods.. I hear that those are a pain in the butt to replace.

Ugh, I remember seeing a perfect set of tin pieces... EVERYTHING, on a
1972 Bus that I saw in the yard about a month ago. I didn't pull the
pieces off because, well, I couldn't get it off and I was in a rush. The
next time I came back, the ENTIRE motor was gone, plus the tin pieces. Oh
well....
