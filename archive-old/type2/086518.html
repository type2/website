Subject: starting fluid

I would use carb cleaner. That is what Master ASE certified mechanics hav=
e told me. It works, and I have been told that it is the safest way. Know=
ing that just the change in fuel these days cause valves to burn with the=
ir higher octane, could you imagine what ether must do? Hey, if you trust=
 telling someone to use it, it's cool! But since carb cleaner works, why =
would u use starting fluid? Sounds like everyone has an opinion on this. =
And, as far as starting the engine, why not just pour a tad of gas down t=
he carb? Always worked for me. Carb cleaner will work for this also, and =
you dont have to worry about destruction to the engine. Now I know we are=
 straying from bus content now but are there any ASE certified mechanics =
out there who went to engine building school willing to comment on this? =
I am just interested in giving the original messenger some sound, and saf=
e info. Why use something controversial if something that isn't is safe a=
nd effective?
