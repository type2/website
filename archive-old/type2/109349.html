Subject: [T2] RE: Mexico VW - call for help !!

&gt; it looks like some guys need help with their VW  Bus...
&gt; http://home.att_dot_net/~honey_bus/barrybus.jpg

Does anyone know the actual story behind this picture?  Was it from a news
article?

I'm curious as to the reason why these folk appear to be trying to save what
they can of their household goods from a raging fire.  If this in Mexico,
volcanic eruption?  Forest fire?  If South America, forest fire or gorilla
attack?  Any ideas?
