&gt; Haven't tried them, but I too am tempted.  One thing I worry about is how they
&gt; are fastened down.  I assume you must replace the rocker arm studs with longer
&gt; ones.  These studs are not very thick and were not designed to cope with the
&gt; added stress of holding down the valve covers.  Maybe it's not important, but
&gt; it bothers me.  I would feel better if they were held down by all four studs,
&gt; but I bet it's only two.

For some reason they require four fasteners instead of two per side which
means more work.

If it's like the Type 1 covers, the nut is replaced by a elongated nut
(forgot the name) that you still use to tighten the rocker shaft. Then you
secure the cover with 4 hex head bolts that screw into the other end of the
elongated nut. Included are o-rings to keep it sealed.
