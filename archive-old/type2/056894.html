Subject: RE: Pop-top canvas &amp; camping

Go visit Dawn at PLF. &lt;&lt;www.plfvw_dot_com&gt;&gt; also there is link from my type
II site
to her site.
----------------------------------------------------
A while back someone posted a question regarding the replacement of the
mosquito screen on the front window of the pop-top.  My canvas is in
good shape too but the zipper to the canvas flap is ruined so it can't
be zipped up.  It didn't see a response to the question so I am
wondering if anyone has ever tried to replace just the window and saved
the rest of the canvas.

The Olympic peninsula campout is still on.
