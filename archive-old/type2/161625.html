Subject: E-brake lite wiring?

P.O. removed b-lite from dash. Left a big hole. Got one from Pick-n-Pull. 
I'm not sure where to connect the wires.
There are 5 wires.
1 short red wire. Still has connector on it. Is there a reserved power spot 
under the dash for it?
2 brown wires. Why two grounds coming out of same spot?
1 grey w/ yellow stripe
1 black

Hope someone can help.
Thanks,
BusBoyBob
