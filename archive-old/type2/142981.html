Subject: Performance Type 4's?

So I was cruising aircooled_dot_net and saw some really large p&amp;c kits.
And it got me thinking.

Who's bumped up their T4 engines on this list? What were your experiences?

I'd ask this over on the Samba but Jake'd jump in and pimp his goodies
that only oil executives can afford. ;)
