&gt; Went to auto zone and bought an led &quot;third&quot; tailight for about
&gt; $18.  It is about 12 inches long.

&gt; super glued it to the top of the back window on the inside...almost looks 
&gt; stock&lt;grin&gt;...had to groove the gluing part so that it cleared the 
&gt; defrost strip.

yes good idea BUT that is not what I am trying to do

I am trying to get LED's behind the original taillight lenses so that it
looks stock but has bright lights so you can be seen, starting with
stop/tail lights, hope to get turn signals working too, not going to
bother with backup light.


may later put in the third light like you have done
