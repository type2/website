&gt; After posting I went back to my testing and discovered that I had 
&gt; continuity
&gt; at the resistor pack connection.  So, you're correct.  However, the Bentley
&gt; says the terminals for the FI connectors are 88e, 88b and 88f, which are
&gt; identified on the dual relay as such.  Is this a Bentley error, or am I
&gt; reading things wrong?

I don't have the bentley in front of me, but I'm guessing that you're 
reading it wrong.  The injectors have to have the resistors on one side 
of the circuit otherwise they will put too large of a load on the 
computer.  I believe that they are lo-z (low impedance) injectors.  I 
have to do the same w/ my MegaSquirt - that or turn on pulse width 
modulation.  It was easier to chop the stock harness and leave the 
resistors in place.
