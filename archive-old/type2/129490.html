Subject: Broken locks (interior)

Hey,

Quick question for you folks. The passenger and driver side doors of
my bus have broken interior lock mechanisms. Basically I can open both
doors using the outside door handle.....and I'm able to lock the
driver side door, but not the passenger side. I took off the interior
door panel to take a look at the mechanism and saw that the metal was
basically smashed from the release handle. So if I try to pull the
handles inside, they just flap around because there's no metal left to
catch and open the door. I've looked at The Bus Depot, BFY Parts, Bus
Boys, and California Imports for the part I need to replace.....and
the only thing I've been able to find is this....
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211898205N but since
it's really the inside of the mechanism that needs replaced, I'm kind
of lost. I also found this part
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=211837015H which is a
&quot;door latch mechanism&quot;....but I have a 73 bus, and this doesn't really
look like the part I need to replace.

Hope this isn't something really obvious that I've overlooked. I'm
just more or less looking for  a place on the Internet that has the
part I need to order. Thanks in advance for any help anyone has to
offer.

-scott
