Subject: Followup -- Idle cutoff woes
Date: Sun, 21 Mar 1999 20:55:10 -0700

Just wanted to thank all those who sent
me advice on the cutoff solenoid which wouldn't
retract without thunking it with a 17mm combination
wrench (well, a 13mm would probably work, but I
digress). I installed a new one on Tuesday, and
have had no problems since.

Thanks again
