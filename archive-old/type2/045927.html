Subject: [T2]  Need help identifying a piston, please, (apology)

Volks,

Please forgive my clumsy writing. Only after I started getting responses did 
I realize that the piston description I gave seemed as if I were describing 
the BAD piston. The description is of the pistons that are good, and that I 
want to identify, and one of which I'd like to find.

BTW, someone asked the crown height. From the center of the gudgeon pin to 
the top is 1.641&quot; or close enough to 41.7mm.

If anyone knows this piston, and especially if you have a usable one, I'd 
really like to hear from you.

Cheers/Don
