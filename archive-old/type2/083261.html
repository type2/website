&gt; My question is
&gt; Which engine was left to do the driving?
&gt; What if you were smart enough to hook both engines up to work together and have
&gt; four wheel drive?

There is a scirocco/late-bus hybrid that I saw at the Dade City bug Jam a
few years back...dual engine, dual transmision, &quot;four wheel&quot; drive.   It
even has two shifters...It doesnt use the full rear end of the bus, just
some of it, though.

I've also seen an ElDorado (mid-ninetys model) that had
been dual engined....they added an STS drivetrain in the rear, then
combined the throttles and (auto)transmission controls....four wheel
drive, twin transaxle twin engine.  Quite a beast, and looked stock from
the outside as long as the trunk was closed!

ps: it was a mkII scirocco and they had a plexi engine lid on the bus
engine compartment...)
