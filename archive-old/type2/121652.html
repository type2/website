&gt;Do you recall; if the push rod tubes are installed on the long block, is the tin that is between the p.r. tubes and the cylinders installed also? I don't have room to have two engines sitting around for long and would like to have every thing ready for reassemble when the rebuilt engine arrives.

FWIW, I've got an AVP 2.0L on the stand right now, and it came with the tin above the P/R tubes already 
installed.
