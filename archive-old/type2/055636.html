&gt;In an effort to balance the splitticentrism that sometimes
&gt;occurs on the list, it would be interesting to read pros and cons
&gt;of the in-line driver's side Westy kit of later loaves versus the
&gt;earlier, split-like kits.


Gee and in fact, we've done that like probably 3-4 times.  Them archives are
still up and running I thought.  Personally I vote for '77-'79 layout
inline, maybe no rear facuing seat but that damn fridge on the outside is a
SOB.  Course the fridge in the '77-'79 is useless.  Guess that's what they
made the Vanagon for.
