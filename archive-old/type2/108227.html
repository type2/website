Subject: Re: [T2] do I need to adjust end play?

Everything else being equal, the endplay is probably OK if the engine is
basically sound to begin with.  Checking the endplay is one of those things
you do just to be sure.  It's best done with a dial gauge, but can also be
done using feeler gauges.

Dial gauge:
Install the 3 shims, but no oil seal, and torque the flywheel down.  Pull
the flywheel out toward you as far as it will go and set your dial gauge to
0.  Push the flywheel forward as far as it will go and read the endplay.

Feeler gauge:
Basically the same process but you measure movement against an &quot;indicator&quot;
which can be a bolt, washer and some nuts.  Pass the bolt through one of the
mounting holes used to connect the engine to the trans, secure it in place
with a nut or nuts, mount a washer or somesuch on the bolt with some more
nuts and measure the movement of the flywheel vis-a-vis the washer with your
feeler gauges.
