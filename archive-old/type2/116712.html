Subject: Re: [T2] Total Immersion (flood damage and buses)

&gt;&gt;I would gnaw
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;my arm off before buying anything made lately for less than $100.  
&gt;&gt;Sears,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Makita, B&amp;D, no matter what, it's *ALL* garbage!

I disagree.. depends on usage.  I have a cordless drill from Sears and the
thing works and works and works. We redid the steel roofing on the house and
my Sears drill did better than the makita my uncle brought.  For a 1/4 of 
the price I
think. Warranty has been fantastic from Sears.
For basic home use I can't see why not.

For Everyday professional use buy professional tools. They are built to last 
longer
work harder on a day to day basis but you pay for it. It's in a different 
wearNtear
bracket.

The only Pro Tool I have is a Bosch Saw which works fantastic and has 
amazing
balance as opposed to say a standard skilsaw. But I got it used for a 
fraction
of the price of new.  If it wasn't available I would have bought a B&amp;D 
skilsaw.

(In fact all my furniture for the van has been made with the cheaper tools 
;)
