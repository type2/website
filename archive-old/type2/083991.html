Subject: Re: [T2] ac &amp; engine pull

Chuck:
I don't think it's as hard as you expect. My old 78 had a/c (I installed
it with a new kit in 1983)
If there is still Freon in the system, I'd just remove the compressor
from its mounting and tie it to the UNDERSIDE of the engine compartment,
up out of the way of the engine's path. I'd use some stiff electrical
wire (I'm and electrical contractor), like #10 or #12 solid wire. (Great
stuff for many temporary repairs, as well!)
I don't think the hoses will let you put it up into the engine
compartment.

&gt; hello-
&gt; 
&gt; I am dismantling my '78 Bus (stock) for restoration &amp;
&gt; I have the dealer-installed AC system.  I plan to keep
&gt; the system, perhaps replacing the york with a sanden.
&gt; For now, I want to get the engine out and wonder how
&gt; to deal with the attached compressor.
