My '74 has done the same thing before.

If it has carbs, look at the linkage on the passenger side carb, where it
connects from the horizontal bar to the throttle plates.  This is an
adjustable connector, and mine occasionally loosens up, which causes it to
lengthen every time I push on the gas, eventually causing a very high
idle.  I eventually had to duct tape mine (duct tape is the single most
useful item you can carry :) ).
