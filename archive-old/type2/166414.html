Subject: Re: [T2] baptism in fuel

Been there, done that. Was under the bus changing the fuel filter and
somehow got upstream confused with downstream and left the wrong hose
unclamped when I removed the filter. (NOTE TO SELF: in the future clamp both
hoses before removing fuel filter.)

I cannot say enough good about sealed fluorescent drop lights. It took a
full bath in gasoline with no problem. If I'd been using an incandescent
drop light...&lt;shudder&gt;

&gt; Why don't we think to CLAMP the hose first?
