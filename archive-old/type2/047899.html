we run into a similar problem here in Salt Lake City. We have a relatively
LONG grade from the city up towards Park City (Parley's Canyon). Guys
upgrade their car's power and all is good until they FULL THROTTLE up the
canyon. The cooling system is designed for stock engine output. Once you
exceed this, all you have to do is add a dash of ignorance and the engine is
history.

It's also worth mentioning that at high elevations, power decreases, but do
does cooling (thin air)!

&gt; &gt; It's not difficult to cool 90hp; it's another matter to cool 150.

&gt; Sounds like the turbo conversion should be a &quot;race&quot; only modification.
Sort of
&gt; like my earlier &quot;bum&quot; post concerning the 30 MM oil pump. :-)
