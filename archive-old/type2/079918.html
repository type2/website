Subject: Re: [T2] Bus insurance

I'm not sure that &quot;assigned value&quot; or &quot;stated
value&quot; insurance is a necessity.   Normal
insurance works in many states and definitely in
mine.  Be careful not to sign anything in your
insurance application or other contractual
material that limits your recovery to some amount
of value assigned to your vehicle.  Point is, you
don't have to settle for $400 just because some
dunderheaded insurance person says that's all
your bus is worth.  (Of course, you may have to
hold out, sue or threaten to sue, etc.)

Also, stated value is a problem too in that
insuring an item for more than it's worth is
usually illegal in that you have an insurable
interest only up to the item's value.  In other
words, you may still be arguing, suing etc.
