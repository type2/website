Subject: Re: [T2] Roof Rack - where to buy?

I do have Tom Conner roof rack envy anxiety.

But until me and the PowerBall see eye to eye (that's right, I'll still be
driving my bus if I win the PowerBall) I'm gonna have to build a rack my
self.

Check out:
    http://www.altrec_dot_com/shop/detail/4386/13  or
    http://www.noc_dot_com/ss/pp/racksys.html
for hardware.

&gt; Tom Conner in Deer Park (?), WA. Spokane area, IIRC.  Check the
&gt; archives.  It's there.

&gt; He's right, those are some very nice handmade racks, and I'm certain
they'd
&gt; last a lifetime. However, the original post metioned a financial need as
&gt; well. Isn't there anywhere you can get these type of things for less than
&gt; 300-400 dollars?
&gt;
&gt; I guess make one yourself!
