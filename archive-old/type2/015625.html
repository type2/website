&gt;We vacationed in Mexico recently.  We flew into Cancun, and went immediately
&gt;to Isla Mujeres.  We then went to Cozumel.

&gt;It appeared to me that about 30-50% of the autos in Mexico are air-cooled
&gt;bugs, busses, things, dune buggies, etc.  It was pretty cool.  

Even in that high temp environment, tropical not temperate, must not be too
many spec (Mexican specs and tolerances and metalurgy even) air cooled
motors burning up from overheating. I would guess that the only ones
destroyed from excess heat are the ones with aftermarket cooler setups or
other out of spec running.

I expect they all run pretty cool when maintained spec. This means also
that you do periodic inspections and when you see oil progressing from
weepage to leakage, you fix it. Leaking is not  spec. When this is allowed
over many months and miles, the oil film will creap into the cooling air
stream slowly over time. This wets the oil cooler and cylinder fins which
combines with dust to clog the matrix and insulate the fins. Result,
diminished out of spec cooling system function. Eventually, the last grade
is met that warps the rings or burns a valve prematurely due to lack of
maintenance when you ignore the leaks. Check Bentley. Inspection for leaks
is at the head of every lubrication inspection. It may not go on to say,
&quot;Fix any leaks found.&quot;, but it is implied and certainly is essential for
proper function.

Doktor Porsche understood these potentials for reduced cooling which is why
you won't even have an overheating problem if you continue to ignore out of
spec conditions until cooling efficientcy has been reduced substantially,
like maybe 20% or more. 

Every hole in the tin without a proper seal adds to loss of system
efficientcy. Spec is all seals in place, or at least a duct tape temp fix,
to prevent unnecessary heat flow to the cool side. Also, holes in the tin
mean a bit less air passing the cylinders. 

Your mainenance inspections must be adjusted for the specific way you use
the vehicle. By inspection only can you KNOW what the proper maintenance
intervals are. Rule of thumb milage/time intervals are not applicable to
over 50% of the vehicles on the road if you have in mind maintaining the
value of the vehicle for extended ownership and use as troublefree
transporation continuiously. 

If you must go non-spec because you have a non-spec criteria you want to
meet beyond what the factory design team contemplated, like I want more
horsepower than they gave me, then you have the task of engineering the new
application and being responsable for it's success or failure. If your
modification is engineered with the same safety margins as any good
engineer would allow, it can function properly and reliably. Bergs have
shown what can be done with enhanced engineering with the T-I motors.  

If you are spec you will not overheat. If you overheat, you are not spec or
you are outside spec operating parameters by a big margin.
