snip!

It will penetrate the
&gt; porous bondo compounds and react with the sheet metal underneath.

not to split hairs but my understanding/experience with POR 15 is that it should be applied _directly_ to the metal (it even states this on the can) as opposed on top of bondo etc. The directions on the canindicate that all you need to do is to scrape away loose surface rust and then apply POR right on the pitted metal..

a few points.. make sure metal is CLEAN before applying POR (i.e no grease/oil/road grime residues)

a few thin coats of POR are better than one thick coat of POR paint

finally wear _good quality_ breathing mask and have LOTS of ventaillation/fan POR has many nasty chemicals in in (isocynates for one).
