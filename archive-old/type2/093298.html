Subject: Re: [T2] Plastic plugs (valance)

Keep the water and rust in....

Seriously I'd like to know 'cause I'm going to have to get some soon.


&gt;I noticed there are two holes on each side of the rear valance.  I think one
&gt;used to have a plug it in and it has since fallen out but I'm not positive.
&gt;
&gt;Where there plugs there and what purpose did they serve?

Chris
