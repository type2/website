I've heard it's good netiquette to introduce yourself when joining lists...

I'm Jim Mowreader. Yesterday, I bought a 1972...uhh, what do you call a
Transporter that's been through the Oregon camper conversion plant? Anyway,
that's what I got. This one has a good transmission but needs *everything*
else, and to make matters worse it was sitting in a parts dealer's lot for
five years of North Carolina sun, a couple of hurricanes, the usual stuff.
