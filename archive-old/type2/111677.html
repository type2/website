&gt; I believe it!  Driving north on 550 one time from Durango to Ouray my 86 GTI

&gt; that read something like &quot;Red Mountain Pass, Elev 11,000 feet.&quot; Man, that's
&gt; an altitude airplanes fly at!  An altimeter (or an oxygen mask) would have

I've been over that pass a few times, both on my BMW motorcycle and
in my '71 bus.  The bus was much slower.

I use the altimeter function of my GPS as a way to guage performance on
hills.  With low power, you can really see the effect of steepness on road
speed, but once you get below 45 or so the rate of climb stays pretty
constant.
