I can  across a set of new heater boxes for an upright (1600cc) motor. How 
can I  tell if I have BUS or BUG heater boxes... the flap controls (hook-up  
points) are on the INSIDE (bug) or OUTSIDE (bus)  ?




hey Michael  the bus ones will have the controls on top, bug ones and  on the 
bottom  later  mark Dearing
