Subject: flaky panelling

sorry if this is not a real &quot;technical&quot; question, but this is a huge
list, so i feel i stand a better chance of getting some advice.

i have a 1970 westy with the wood panelling overhead. there is, i have to
guess, old varnish or something flaking off the ceiling and wall panels.
any time anyone touches it, it sticks to them and is difficult to get
off. i have tried a wet cloth to wipe the stuff off, but it just gets all
over the rag and comes off on your hands or back on the wood. does anyone
have any experience cleaning off the wood so that it doesn't make such a
mess? i am afraid to try sanding it (especially since it just comes right
off) because i don't want to make an even bigger mess.

IS THERE A LESS MESSY WAY TO CLEAN THIS STUFF OFF???

thanks for any suggestions,
chris (tulsavwchic)
