&gt; I think that the distinction here is between &quot;tight&quot; but movable CVs and
&gt; incorrectly assembled (locked) CVs,  If the CV can be moved (even with
&gt; some force) when new, it is not incorrectly assembled.  The use of dry
&gt; moly lubricants by the manufacturer can make new CVs very stiff until
&gt; they run a bit.  I've never received an incorrectly assembled new CV.

It's a matter of articulation. If a used cv joint is assembled incorrectly
it will malfunction in short order.This is noted in the original post
where two used cv joints were locked up. And yes, even a new joint
should articulate, stiff as it is.
