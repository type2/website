Subject: Air cooled vasser boxer

I saw in a VW mag last year a splitty double cab that had a &quot;vasser boxer
motor converted back to air cooled&quot; (yes you read that right)  They had
no specifics on the engine, but I was wondering if anyone had heard or
seen anything similar to this.  You see there a whole load of water
cooled Vanagons with leaky heads. Add a $1,500.00 exhaust job and the van
is for sales as a parts vechicle because of the $3,500 to $4,000 dollar
job.  A potential source for 2.1 Liter engines on the cheap. 
(also those in states without tough emission laws should consider back
dating these late models cast-offs to air cooled) 

Also a friend is looking at a 87 H20 Vanagon pop-top weekender type
tomorrow (yes it has leaky heads) Can anyone tell me about the
reliablilty of these engines, other than the heads?  and any experience
with Boston Engine (Boston Bob) rebuilt engines or elsewise?  P-mail me
on this last subject as it is off topic 
even for Friday ; )
