Subject: Re: [T2] HCBF: bus people in Iraq

Hey Bob:

thanks for the note:   of our moonies,  Kevin is in the service, so he does 
not have much access to email to keep up posted.  Snoopy is working as a 
private contactor so he is able to keep us posted.

he had told us about a lot of VW's that he has seen and keeps us up to date 
via the Full Moon Bus Club Forum

here is a link to the thread that snoopy posts up so we can find out what is 
going on
(you may need to join to read forum, it's free no email, so its all good)
