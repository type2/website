Ok Volks, I posted about my newest member to my VW family and expected to 
get the thumbs down post from most. What I got though was a lot of PM that 
said it should be saved. Honestly, I just bought it because I needed some 
extra rims and maybe a few other odds and ends from this bus for future use. 
After that, it was going to get the sawzall treatment to make some nice wall 
hangings. The bus is actually quite dirty, so the colors will be more vivid 
once I get a chance to wash it.

SO, if anyone out there is wanting to save the rolling art bus, drop me a PM 
with an offer of $$$ or trades. Im getting a good title, so that wont be a 
problem..

Again, the link to the picture is.
