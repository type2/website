Subject: Performance calculations (long and of dubious interest).

 Hi,
	I was playing around with some ideas about assessing the benefits
of engine swaps. I came up with the following and would be interested in
feedback. In particular any errors, assumptions that you think are
wide of the mark and opinions of the conclusions.
 Have fun... :-)

 Some back of the envelope calculations about bus performance:

Brakes:
	Given that a ('77) baywindow bus weighs about 1300kg and has a 1000kg
payload we note that the brakes are designed to stop the beast from rated
maximum speed (79mph) and thus determine that they ought to be capable of
stopping an unladen bus from a higher speed. Grip is linearly related to
weight and thus it is the efficiency of the brakes that determine stopping
distance (reference: Physics of Racing series).

 E(k)=mv^2 (energy increases linearly with mass but with the square of speed)

 Double the mass, double the energy
 Double the speed, quadruple the energy

 or, more generally:

 For same total energy: mv^2=MV^2

	 changing mass: v=sqrt(M/m)*V

	changing speed: m=M(V/v)^2
		

So, an unladen bus has 1300/2300 of the mass of a fully laden one and could
be stopped in approximately the same distance from:

			v=sqrt(2300/1300)*79
			 = 105mph

 Using the same calculation for a half load:

			v=sqrt(2300/1800)*79
			 = 89mph

 Any faster (or heavier) than this and a brake upgrade would be a Good Idea.

Power:
	A conventional car is said to use about 25-30bhp to hold 65mph.
Estimating that a bus has roughly double the aerodynamic drag of a
normal car (partly due to worse Cd and partly higher frontal area) we
might think that it would need around 50bhp to hold the same speed.
This concurs with the observation that a 1600cc dual port bus has 50bhp
and a top speed in the vicinity of 65mph.

 Given that aerodynamic drag goes up with the square of speed and is the major
part of the drag experienced we might suggest the following:

		Power | Top Speed
		------+----------
		  50  |   65
		  70  |   77	(cf. 2.0l bus)
		 100  |   92
		 125  |  103
		 150  |  112
		 175  |  121

 Noting, of course, that increasing the weight of the bus will not make a
large difference to its drag we need to bear in mind that a 125bhp bus would
probably be capable of over 100mph fully loaded- but stopping it with stock
brakes would take a while...

 
 Hills:
	Buses climb hills slowly as a result of their poor power to weight
ratio. Increasing this to a level more in line with other vehicles on the
road would offset the affect of hills.

	Energy = Mass * G * Height (G is force due to gravity- basically
				    how much the earth sucks...)

	We take weight as 1300Kg (empty bus) G as 10 (from school physics)
and height as the elevation gain due to gradient. On a 1 in 10 hill, for
example, you gain 1m elevation for every 10m forward travel, so if you are
travelling at 30 ms (about 65mph) you'll be gaining 3 metres of height
per second. Combining all this gives us:

 Power used climbing = 1300 * speed * 10 / gradient * 2.23 * 745

 1300 is weight in Kg, speed in mph, 10 is the gravitational suck factor,
gradient is the steepness of the hill, 20 for a 1 in 20, 10 for a 1 in 10.
 the last two factors convert from mph to ms and bhp to watts, allowing us
to input speed in mph and get power in bhp.
 We can combine the constants to get &quot;Power= 7.8 * speed / gradient&quot;, for
an empty bus, 10.8 for a half loaded one and 13.8 for one that's fully laden.

 We might then put together the following summary:


   bhp  |     empty (1300Kg)    |   half load (1800Kg)  |   full load (2300Kg)
        |			|			|
  Speed | level | 1in20 | 1in15 | level | 1in20 | 1in15 | level | 1in20 | 1in15
 -------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------
    45	|   24	|   41	|   47	|   24	|   48	|   56	|   24	|   55	|   65
    55	|   36	|   57	|   64	|   36	|   65	|   75	|   36	|   74	|   86
    65	|   50	|   75	|   84	|   50	|   85	|   97	|   50	|   95	|  110
    75	|   66	|   96	|  105	|   66	|  107	|  120	|   66	|  118	|  135
    85	|   85	|  119	|  130	|   85	|  131	|  147	|   85	|  144	|  164

 The number in the table being the power in bhp needed to maintain the
given speed under the indicated conditions.

 I think that this isn't far off what you'd expect to see. Looking at the top
left of the table we can see that a 50bhp 1600cc bus should do about 65mph
on level ground (a bit pessimistic?) and hold 45 on a pretty steep hill when
unladen. With a full load on it won't make 45 up a steep hill on the highway.

 If we move up to a 65bhp 1700cc bus we note that it'll see nearer 75mph on
the flats and hold 55 on the same hill. Load it up and it'll manage 45mph up
our steep highway grade. That seems about right to me, can anyone support or
challenge? 

 A 70bhp 2000cc bus isn't much quicker on the flats, though it does climb a
little better, however this is mostly because it's flatter torque curve allows
it to pull better as the load comes on- it would probably be close to 55 up
a steepish highway grade when laden, whereas the 1700cc bus would have come
off its torque peak and lost speed.

 What can we extrapolate from this? Lets say you want to keep up with freeway
traffic on the flats but you live in pretty flat countryside, so you don't
mind using the slow lane if you're touring. If traffic on your freeway moves
at about 75mph you can be happy with a stock type-4 bus. Similarly, if you
live in a hilly area and often carry a load but don't mind chugging up the
slopes at 55 a type-4 bus is just your thing.

 If you want to go further (actually, faster...) than this, you're looking
at an engine swap. Let's say you often carry a half load (500Kg: a family
might be half that, add in water, food gear and tools/spares and you won't
be far off) and want to be able to hold 70mph up a grade, the table above
suggests that you might need about 100bhp. Maybe a Golf/Audi engine would
work, or a Subaru unit (or a late model vanagon?).

 Perhaps you're a bit of a loon- you want to be able to keep up with the
big boys in the outside lane and still have enough in reserve to hold that
sort of speed up a steep highway (Well, they're going to be a bit upset at
having been passed by a bus- you don't want them to catch you at the next
climb do you?). You might be looking for 125-130bhp: Porsche/Chevy V6 territory.

  How about if you often drive a full load (dog, surfboard, six weeks
food and water plus half a ton of spares &amp; tools?) but want to be able to 
embarrass the BMW drivers as you cross the Rockies. In that case you either
need 180bhp (that's a 3.0l 911SC, BTW) and a serious brake upgrade or, more
likely, to have a quiet chat with these nice gentlemen over here in the
long white coats...
 
Cheers,
        W.
