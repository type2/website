Subject: Re: [T2] Dells vs. Webers

I think Fat Performance and CB Performance has what you want but you will 
have to ask specifcally for them. CB Performance lists only &quot;turbo&quot; 
emulsion tubes with no hint how they might relate to stock emulsion tubes 
but I think if you ask they will have what you want

&gt;Then maybe you could tell me where to find some emulsion tubes for
&gt;my DRLA 40's?  I have found zero sources for them in the US.
