Subject: Re: [T2] Re; Parcel Trays

&gt; They never touch your shins, nowhere near. Not the stock ones, and I have 
&gt; seen the aftermarket plastic one from Just Kampers and it is the same size 
&gt; as the stock ones, so they are fine also. If you have kids that like to 
&gt; put their feet up when they are sitting in the front seat, they get in the 
&gt; of that, however.

It's also a problem if you've got a girlfriend who likes to put her feet on 
the shelf, plastic parcel trays tend to crack when people do this in my 
experience :o(
