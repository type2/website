Subject: Bulkhead removal and different front seats

Hi,

I have a 9 seater microbus which I loath to change however my wife
just can't get on with the front seats. She likes her comfort (likes
to sleep in the car) and the bench seat doesn't recline. If I don't
get the comfort sorted its border line whether the wife will give it
the boot........ (Konis on the way to sort out the ride)

What are my options? I am thinking Vanagon seats or is there something
better? My wife has difficulty depressing the clutch while driving as
the current seat is just a little too high.

I have a full width bulkhead. Too get more reclination of the
potential new seats I think I would have to remove it. Any comments on
removal? I have seen this thread

http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/type2/034398.html

About strengthening if one is not in place?

Here's my setup

Bench seat in front with fixed pasenger front seat and railed drivers
seat. Here are some pictures of the front (the colour of the bus was
not my choice however its as solid as a rock and I'm getting used to
the green)

All comments / combinations welcome. I've got to get this one right !!

Charles
