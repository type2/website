Subject: Re: [T2]  brakes, what  did I miss??? 

Yes, air rises. Good thing you figured it out and next
time you'll know. Each of us starts at a different
&quot;level&quot; of understanding and mechanical aptitude.
Sometimes the simplest things don't sink in - often
because we get tunnel vision from getting too involved
in one aspect or another... Bottom line on the Bentley
mis-info is that there are two circuits - front and
rear. When bleeding, start at the furthest point. Most
of us old-timers were bleeding brakes when there were
single piston master cylinders. It mattered that you
start at the back. With the dual chamber, it is
essential that on each circuit you start from the
furthest point. Okay?

Pulling can still be an air bubble but is often uneven
adjustment. Sometimes it is the opposite side dragging
(no - really!) -BaH

Yeah, well if Bentley expects people to know certain
 things, why on earth
 would it contradict the knowledge it is expecting
 you already have? Bentley
 says to start from the front and work your way back,
 when the proper
 procedure is to start from the BACK and work your
 way front. WTF?
 
 Either way, I have my brakes now. All I have to do
 is get a couple of bottle
 jacks from Harbor Freight so that I can jack up the
 rear and polish off my
 brakes again.
