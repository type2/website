Subject: Re: Friday-Deadheads and busses

was writ...
&gt;I have been doing a very UN-scientific, informal sociologocal study over
&gt;the last few years of Deadheads, bus owners, and other totally trivial
&gt;stuff.  My findings are as follows:  1) Deadheads in general are NOT bad
&gt;bus owners, but the younger the bus owner\deadhead, the worse shape they
&gt;keep their bus in.  2)If you are considering buying a bus from a Deadhead,
&gt;first ask them what their favorite Grateful Dead song is or which GD song
&gt;first got them into the scene, If they answer &quot;Touch of Grey&quot;, run away as
&gt;fast as you possibly can and don't look back. 3)Don't buy a bus from
&gt;someone with both Grateful Dead stickers AND PHISH stickers in the window,
&gt;it will almost certainly not have been tuned up in the past year.  4)Don't
&gt;buy a bus from a Deadhead (or anyone else for that matter) who has
&gt;advertised the bus as either a &quot;Shaggin Wagon&quot; or a &quot;Hippie Bus&quot; or &quot;Dead
&gt;Sled&quot;, because they have obviously missed the point. 5) When buying a bus
&gt;from a Deadhead, you can add five kharma po!
&gt;ints for every GD Show that the bus has been at, but take away 2 points
&gt;for every PHISH concert which it has attended

seriously? before i became a sociologist i'd done some un-scientific
studies too. results: i learned not to generalize people on any scale.
sometimes its good to park the bus and travel by foot. is that in the
charter? all sorts of good people make bad buses. cb'ers, sure. case in
point: last week, a feller and his companion taking pictures of eugene
buses http://www.geocities_dot_com/eugenebuses/ drove over in his 71 deluxe
accident waiting to happen. huge oil puddles happened while he snapped
pictures; fuel filter a half inch above the coil - no clamps on the fuel
hoses; lots of valuable tools and parts, but no fire extinguisher. he had a
sticker on the bus that was from a univerisity, but it was cut to say just
&quot;universe&quot;. we're everywhere.

i never had the luck of touring dead &amp; jgb shows in a vw bus. even a beater
bus - that'd been a luxury. all young, jam band music makers come to
eugene. we will get parts, we will survive. almost certainly.   - steve
