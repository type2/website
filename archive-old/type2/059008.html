Subject: 1800 spitting oil/2.0 litre anyone? '64 FS

I'm looking into a '74 bus with an 1800 in it. This bus died 6 years ago and was trailered 80 miles to the shop where it now sits. Mechanic told dude it was ?lifters? and would cost $1200 to $1500 depending on what he found. The owner says it started smoking and then started spitting oil out the tailpipe; I think he drove it while it got progressively worse. Is this indicative of a cracked head(s)? valve guides? badly worn rings/cylinders? 

Dude said the same thing happened around 45,000; had it rebuilt. Then again around 90,000; parked it. Waiting for kid to grow up and take on bus. Kid grew up; bus grew weeds around it.

I understand that the 1800 is particularly bad for heads. What else should I know before I dive in feet first?

If I can find a 2.0 litre to put in here, what should I expect to pay? Anyone got one? What problems might I encounter compared to a 1600? This bus, btw, has a weber carb on it; not the standard dual carb setup for the year.

BTW, if anyone's interested, I have a good '64 standard up for sale for $2900 obo. Will consider camper-type trades.

Thanks! Joe Fournier
