X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Coocoo sends:

&gt; There was a scorching column in last month's Hot VW mag slamming anyone
who
&gt; wanted to modify their bus in any way, and I've had my ear bent at several
&gt; VW events about keeping the bus &quot;pure&quot;. Aside from cutting out the rear
&gt; wheel metal (yuk) I plan to personalize it any way I desire. It was a
rusty,
&gt; bondo covered piece of crud when I found it, so no one can say I've
&quot;ruined&quot;
&gt; it.

I say:

I've had the same ear bending, although not that often and my Bus is not
even rare yet!! It's a 75 Camper.  As for paint I plan to paint it like
Herbie, you know the thing numbers on the side, racing stripe across the
centre (offset) etc, with maybe a few period sponsorship decals etc.  But
the proposed paint isn't the reason I get hassled it's the V8 engine in the
back, which leads me to my question.....

Does anyone know of a tire that has the correct load rating but comes in a
235/65/15 and 215/65/15??  I plan to lower the bus with it's new(to be)
paint job and put on lower profile tires for even better acceleration as it
now runs 235/75/15 on the back.   I'd also like to move my radiator under
the front of the Bus instead of behind the current bullbar, anyone else who
has a water cooled conversion got the radiator mounted between the chassis
rails at the front??? and if so how does it handle the heat, bear in mind
I'm in Sydney Australia and can see Summer temps up to 110F occasionally and
if I head North even higher.

Cheers
Steve

P.S I've waited all week until Friday to post this, just incase ;)
