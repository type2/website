Subject: Fuel Injection Problem???
Message-ID: &lt;a166ef73.2464a0e2_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello

Well I have spent a little more time trying to figure out why the idle on my 
77 (2.0L FI) is horrible (previous post)..

Ever since I put in new fuel injection lines in it seems that the engine 
misses quite a bit.  After 10 min of starting and stalling and running a 
pretty high idle the engine will settle into a very very low skipping idle.  
If I spray starting fluid into the air cleaner the idle will smooth out and 
rise.  Does this mean a fuel injection problem??  I have checked the vacuum 
hoses three times they are all connected.  The plugs, cap and rotor are all 
new and the valve were adjusted about 1,000 miles ago.

Since the starting fluid helps I am thinking that this means there is 
something wrong with the fuel injectors??  Is there an easy way to test to 
make sure they are getting current?  How hard are they to pull out and check 
to see if they are delivering fuel??

PLEASE HELP!!!  I was just about to start go camping on the weekends.  

Has anyone else had this problem right after changing the fuel lines?  The 
engine used to run GREAT until I changed the fuel lines!!!!!  I thought that 
would be good karma??

getting scared of fuel injection,
