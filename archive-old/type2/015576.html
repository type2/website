&gt;Since buying my 71 westy a year ago I often hear a clunking sound somewhere 
&gt;back there when going over bumps (lots of bumps here in New Orleans). Since 
&gt;that time, the engine (due to other reasons) has been replaced twice, so I 
&gt;assume the mounts are ok, hope so anyway. Any ideas what to check for, in 
&gt;order of possibility? 

Don't assume or hope anything. Verify. Start with the motor mounts. Take a
lever and find a purchase from the chassis to the motor and see if you can
lift or twist the motor out of square with the cross bar from either side.
You could use a jack as well with care. Then grab hold of the various
exhaust pipes and such and see what you find. You just can't actually do
any of this without getting your hands dirty. Could be the battery if the
hold down is wasted like 95% of the originals that remain on the to do
list. Me too.
