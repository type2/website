Great idea. I didn't think about opening the rear hatch and attaching 
the IV to it. The small hose I used took about 15 minutes to drain a 
quart of 80-90 weight. The larger hose would have been a great help... 
but I could add 9/10ths of a quart to the reservoir. By the time I had 
the engine oil drained, it was ready for more oil. 

Oh yes, one thing I forgot. I pushed a tack through the hose and the 
nozzle on the bottle. The nozzle (nipple) is taper, so the hose kept 
trying to work its way off.
