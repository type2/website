Subject: good news

Well, I just had to share my good news.  At least I know you guys will care.  (OK, some of you!)   I decided many years too late to buy a good rolling jack and some  stands.  I'm starting to do a lot of work that I used to pay to  have done.  Seems like VW's sucker you into that.  Anyhow, I  checked Harbor Freight, Pepboys, Autozone, etc.  And guess  what?  The Sears Essentials store near my house had a 3 ton jack  for $59!  It's a bit heavy, but I'm really impressed with  it.  It goes almost 20&quot; high and is solid as a rock.  I found  it on the Sears website.  They didn't have one on the shelf at  this store but I asked about it and they had three of them in the stock  room.  I can go look at the part number if anyone else is  interested.
  
  A neighbor has a H. F. Chinese 2 ton unit.  It wouldn't hold my  Jag up!  It is a heavy car, but come on.  This one is no  problem.  And they had the good sturdy 3 ton jack stands on sale  for $18.  So I've got plans!  And no more borrowing my  neighbors jack.   And I love seeing that 'Craftsman' that was  $10 cheaper than 'Hong Kong Freight'.  Oh well, It's probably  Chinese too, but I've had good luck with Sears' stuff.  Up next,  steering box.  And Spring has arrived a bit early down  South.  Thanks for listening.  Cheers....KR
