Subject: Fuel tank venting to a Weber prog...
Message-ID: &lt;19990502171734.22181.qmail_at_aw164_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

List,
Couple-a gas tank questions:
Local bus boneyard/rebuild VW career guys says for old rusty tanks that aren't
too bad, he has been known to drop a few jasper-marble sized lead sinkers in
the tank, buy 5 or ten filters...
Cuss/discuss?

Main Q: No more dual carbs, no more funky breather with vac nipples all over
it, still got them fuel tank evap/fume reclamation lines runnin' up through
the 'vent pillars' and lookin' me in the face from the top of the engine
cmptmnt.  Can i just cap these things?  Should i &quot;T&quot; 'em into the PCV line
going into the bottom of the rectangular Weber breather? 

TIA,
