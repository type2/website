&gt; A friend of mine and her '76 bus are stuck in Oaxaca, Mexico. A head needed

&gt; things back up. She's been there for almost 3 weeks now and will soon need
&gt; to head back home to Quebec. If the bus cannot be fixed, she will need to
&gt; sell it there.

this is why im a fan of carburetors, any mechanic can figure it out..

If i were going to mexico i would take a t1 bus or a carbureted t4 or a
lot of spares and knowlege to go with my fi system.

&gt; Anyone down there who can help by any chance?

I am not down there but i can help.. by offering this suggestion:
If they have the money to do so, call a VW supplier in the us, have a
weber carb, fuel pump, and pressure regulator shipped down. Have the local
mechanics install this... limp home and put the FI back in order and sell
the carb. or keep the stuff in a cabinet just in case...

This would set them back around $500 plus whatever the mechanics charge...
and would keep them from likely taking a much bigger loss on the bus if
they had to sell it down there not running.

Heck, someone here probably has a single weber kit they would sell cheap
and ship down there... nobody likes those things.. anyone?

take care,

Steve

p.s. this is just an off the cuff suggestion, but may be better than
abandoning a loved bus... please offer more if you have ideas better than
mine.  I am assuming the stuck person doesnt have the know-how to
troubleshoot their FI themselves...
