Subject: Books on bodywork (&amp; welding)

All,
     I searched the archives but came up with much less than I expected on 
this subject.  Maybe I'm not good at searching :-)  I would like to know 
what books people have read and found valuable for learning bodywork, 
painting, and welding skills.  I was hoping to find a couple of books that 
could teach me in plain English (and pictures) what tools I need, and how to 
use them to repair rust by welding in new panels, fix dents, and generally 
prepare a vehicle body for painting.  The books do not have to be VW 
specific, as I imagine the basic skills used are the same.  If you have 
books to recommend on related subjects, I'll take those too!  Websites are 
also appreciated.  If this is a tired subject, feel free to p-mail me.
