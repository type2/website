&gt; Do any of you prefer a year? 

My favorites are the 78 and 71. (I own a 78 Westy)
Check out the Bus Depots Camper Buyer's Guide at:
http://busdepot_dot_com/campers.htm (This helped me alot.)

&gt; Are VWs good to learn mechanics on?

Easier then most vehicles. Be prepared to buy more
tools though.

&gt;  This isnt a big issue, however is 60 mph max speed?

I don't know about earlier Loafs, but my 78 can do a
little over seventy mph.

&gt; 6. How good are the car stereo?   Can it be easily
&gt; retrofitted with a new 
&gt; one?  

I just bought a anti-thief stereo system for my bus.
Radio cost $24, speakers $20. Nobody steals the cheap
stuff :)

Hope this helps,
