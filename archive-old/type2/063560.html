Subject: Bug heater cable in bus?

Hey all

Here's a question - I snapped a rusty heater cable on my 
'77 Westy.  I have a nice set of new cables for my '60 bug.
Intuition tells me the bug cables will be too short, but I
thought I'd ask anyway.  Anybody know if I can use the '60 bug
cables for the heater controls on the '77 Westy (without cutting
and twisting :-))?

        Thanks
                Jay
