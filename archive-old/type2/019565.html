&gt; &gt; has thought about &quot;wind power&quot; to charge a battery.
&gt; &gt; windmills can do a good job of supply electricity to a
&gt; &gt; home so why not some type of turbine, wind powered
&gt; &gt; generator on a bus.   driving down the road would
&gt; &gt; cause it to turn and could charge a couple batteries
&gt; &gt; for camp.

The drag on the bus would outweigh the energy generated.  Why not just
let the engine drive the generator, rather than the engine driving the
bus, creating the airflow to drive the fan, to drive the generator?  Far
less lossy.

&gt; I don't suppose you'd get much current from a
&gt; setup like this, but it would be &quot;free&quot; power

Only when you're parked up, or coasting downhill.

I've just got back from the Centre for Alternative Technology in
mid-Wales, they've got loads of ideas on this kind of thing.  If you're
on this side of the pond, go see them, pick up some literature.  They
have books and pamphlets on generating your own energy from a variety of
sources.  Why not cover the roof with solar cells?

Chris.
