Subject: Re: 72 westy shuts down when hot

More information, please. Does it sputter and stop or just stop? Does it 
happen when idling or when driving along?


Volks,
I just purchased a 72 Westy, beautiful looking bus but..., after about 40-45
minutes of driving it shuts down. No warning lights, or any other obvious
problems. My mechanic tried to diagnose over the phone, and gave me a
replacement coil, no change. It again drove fine for 45 minutes and again
shut down. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks in advance
