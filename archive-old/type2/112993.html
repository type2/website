&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever attempted converting a Bubble/High top back to a hard top?
&gt; If so, what were some of the challenges you faced? If not, what challenges
&gt; might you expect.

Unless your camper was made from a sunroof model Bus you're going to have a very serious roof leak to patch up - about 4' X 4'.
