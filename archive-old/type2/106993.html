Subject: Re: The reason my bus won't start...

I also have a bus with a red ground cable--and that is why I was able to buy
an unrunning bus for $650.  Took me a while to figure it out--would not run
with the electronic distributor so popped in a 009 and it ran.  Made it
about 200 miles before it got dark.  Sure enough it died soon after I turned
the lights on.

I didn't experience the alternator fireworks (since I have a generator) but
I would imagine that if that is what fried, if you replace it you should be
good to go (but then again, it should start and run regardless of alternator
condition).  If you still have no luck then go with the new VR.  Are you
sure you have an alternator and not the stock generator?
