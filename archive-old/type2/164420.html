Subject: We've got room - one way...

Hi all,

Great news for me, I'm finally going to pick-up my '59 Double-Cab down in the
Dallas, TX area and bring it back home to the St. Louis region next weekend
(Nov 17-19).  We'll be travelling down there with an empty trailer, so if
anyone wants/needs something (vehilcle) hauled on that route (STL to DFW)
email me at bill_at_bnnta_dot_com .  We'll be full for the return.  I can't wait to
get it out of the body shop and back into my garage for a slow re-assembly.

Fingers crossed for an uneventful journey...

Bill Bowman
