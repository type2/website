We drove our '76 westy through some pretty nasty winds to get to the 
first CCC meet at Big Sur in 1995.  I'd guess wind speeds of 35 - 50 mph 
and gusty, and it was something we had to drive very carefully in.  Bus 
was being blown all over the road, and Christa got so scared she started 
crying.  Learned later Linda Johnson cried driving with Steve, so it 
wasn't just me.  ;-)

I agree with Dave.  Park it in a concrete parkade if you can to get you 
and your bus through the storm safe and sound.  Get a ride home in a 
co-worker's Sentra.  Driving a bus in severe weather poses a risk for 
banging it up, so if you're concerned, leave it parked in a safe spot.

(If you can find a safe covered spot, why not spend a nice night riding out 
the storm sleeping in your westy?)
