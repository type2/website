&gt; &gt; Volks,
&gt; &gt; On the FI engine the safety screen would have to be removed to rotate the
&gt; &gt; crankshaft with a wrench. So my alternative has been to put the van in 4th
&gt;
&gt; The trick to that is to snip a two or three square section out of the
&gt; screen, so that you can get your socket and extension in ther. (you may
&gt; redirect all flames to dev-null_at_type2_dot_com, thank you.)

Or, you could squeeze the fan belt together with the thumb and forefinger while
turning the alternator nut with a wrench.
