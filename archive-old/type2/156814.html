&gt; I spill more gas with those things. I have no problem anywhere else. Just
&gt; with these &quot;Vapor Recovery&quot; nozzles.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody got any tricks or suggestions fo rmy 78?
&gt;
&gt; I tried shoving the thing all the way in, but then the nozzle gets stuck.
&gt; Holding the accordion tube by hand defeats the auto shutoff. Bleh.

1. get an early bay with a manly 2.5&quot; &quot;straight shot&quot; fuel fill
2. be happy!

Seriously, if you hold the &quot;boot&quot; back far enough the nozzle will function
normally.

Some stations have the &quot;bootless&quot; nozzles with the little vacuum holes in
the nozzle,  They work pretty well, but they are rare.

I agree about the gas spills.  When it comes to these nozzles &quot;It's not a
good idea, It's the law!&quot;
