Subject: Re: [T2] Tie Rods - Tips and Request for Tips

Hi Steve,

Why not grind a flat two spots onto the shaft of the stud? Then you can hold
it steady with an open-end wrench, while you reef on the nylock nut with
another open-ended wrench.

If the flat spots are on the shaft of the stud &quot;behind&quot; the nylock nut they
shouldn't affect the load capacity of the stud.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; OK, so I am still farting around with the poor '73 front end... shoulda
&gt; been done weeks/months ago, but I am a lazy scut and it is definitely a
&gt; secondary vehicle.  Anyhow...
&gt; 
&gt; Todays task was to get the tie rods back on.  Now some tie rods come with
&gt; castellated nuts and a hole drilled thru the stud.  These are a doddle to
&gt; return to service.  pop the tie rod on, tighten nut, insert cotter pin,
&gt; done.  Most modern tie rods, however, come with nylocks (aka stop nuts).
&gt; In *most* applications, nylocks are fine.  A bit hard to get on, but not
&gt; more than 20 ft/pounds and nothing a normal person cannot handle.  The
&gt; problem with using them on tie rods is that the stud is free to rotate and
&gt; applying 20 ft/pounds of torque is *certain* to make the stud rotate,
&gt; frustrating your efforts.  With ball joints, all the civilized
&gt; manufactureres cut flats into the bottom of the stud so you can get a
&gt; wrench on and hold the stud from turning.  With tie rods, ther is no way
&gt; to hold the stud, as far as I can tell (and I *looked* today!!!)
&gt; 
&gt; Now used nylocks go on much more easily than new ones, but you really
&gt; really do not want to reuse nylocks on tie rods!!!  Especially on the drag
&gt; link!!!  I used to reuse them, but was taught a severe lesson late one
&gt; night in PA when the nut dropped off one of my tie rods.  Cost me $60 for
&gt; one nut and I regarded that as a bargain!  One really nice thing about the
&gt; steering geometry of a bus is that if you lose one tie rod, you can still
&gt; drive *forward* and you can still steer.  It is not a happy ride, but you
&gt; will survive.  The same cannot be said if you lose the drag link!  You may
&gt; survive, if the road is straight and you stop quickly, but you will have
&gt; *NO* steering at all!!!
&gt; 
&gt; SO... I went out and bought 6 new nylocks.  For the archives information,
&gt; the size on these is M12x1.5, a large fine thread that is common to many
&gt; European/Japanese cars.  They are not hard to find at any decent FLAPS.
&gt; You have no excuse, OK?
&gt; 
&gt; Now, back to the original problem... holding the stud...  My first course
&gt; is always to give the tie rod end a couple raps with a hammer.  This will
&gt; *sometimes* seat the tapered shaft to the point that you can crank the nut
&gt; on.  If that fails, I have a plain M12x1.5 that I can crank on.  That
&gt; *usually* pulls the stud down firm, remove plain nut, crank down nylock,
&gt; done.  Once in a while (on two studs this time around) neither technique
&gt; will seat the stud.  On one of these, I had a third option that worked
&gt; out.  The right hand side inner stud was being a problem, but fortuantely,
&gt; the stud points up.  I put the hydralic jack under the tie rod end and
&gt; applied a bit of pressure, forcing it into the arm and got the nut on.
&gt; Not pretty, not good for the relay arm bushings, but it worked.
&gt; 
&gt; The last nut... a real problem child... is the rear nut for the drag link.
&gt; As described above, this is critical and I will not reuse a nut here.  As
&gt; a result, I need help.  Mark, Tim, anyone... HOW????
&gt; 
&gt; I have a pair of castellated nuts off an old tie rod (my plain nuts for
&gt; initial snugging) so one thought is to pull the drag link, drill for a
&gt; cotter pin and use a castellated nut.  I worry that the stud is hardened
&gt; (hell, I *hope* the stud is hardened!!) so this may not work.
&gt; 
&gt; My second thought involves marring the taper on the stud with a vice grip
&gt; so that it strongly engages the female taper.  Again, a hardened stud
&gt; would defeat this.
