Your respirator idea is not a good one.

e.g.
&gt;Here's a hairball idea I've had (I currently don't have a breathing
&gt;apparatus aside from my own lungs, that is):  I was thinking of taking one
&gt;of those army surplus gas masks and fitting it with a long hose that I could
&gt;place outside my workspace near a clean air source.  It seems like an
&gt;affordable way to avoid paint fumes/sawdust--I don't know how large the hose
&gt;would have to be or the limits of its length for safe breathing--I figure
&gt;after passing out a few times for lack of 02, I'll eventually get it right
&gt;;).  I haven't tried making one yet, just thought I'd &quot;throw the idea in the
&gt;air.&quot;

Because if you attach a hose to your face what you end up doing is
rebreathing all your exhaled air.  That works fine for a few minutes.  But
then CO2 starts to accumulate in your bloodstream.  CO2 is what regulates
your breathing rate.  So you start to breathe faster.  There is less oxygen
with each breath, you breathe real fast and pass out.  Soon you run out of
O2 and you die and your children inherit your van.

Unless you have two tubes and a one-way valve attached to the gas mask you
is sure going to expire.  Those GI gas masks are pretty uncomfortable, too.
They cover up your whole face, restrict your vision, make you wish you had
stayed home and got that college deferral.

Put me in your will if you have any '72 loaf parts.
