Subject: Re: [T2] - Key stuck in ignition..

Hi Aaron:

Here's what needs to be done:
http://www.ratwell_dot_com/mirror/bclausen/How_to_files/IgnSw/index.html

Once the lock cylinder is removed it should be possible to start the  
bus from the switch behind the column until the key switch is replaced.

www.steveslockshop_dot_com would be a good source to get a replacement  
ignition cylinder pre-keyed to match the door locks.


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
