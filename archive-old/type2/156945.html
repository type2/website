Subject: Re: [T2] Corvair Notes

&gt; The parts for my conversion came from Clark's Corvair: 
http://www.corvair_dot_com/user-cgi/main This included engine mounts,
wiring harness, axle adapters (that make use of the VW axles and CV
Joints), and vague instructions.

Got this from Clark's when I noticed that the kits were listed as NLA,
and asked them about it:
--
Sorry, we were the only supplier of the kits and over the years
interest slowed to the point that we did not reproduce more of the
kits, at this point the only things available are the axle adaptors and
the front transmission mount, all other items have been discontinued.
Most bus owners of these years are now wanting to keep them stock.
sorry.
--

I guess those wanting to increase the power of their bus will have to
find another alternative.  Back to climbing hills with the flashers on
:(

PS: an update on my front end efforts... I got the steering knuckles
connected to the new ball joints last night (but I just realized I
forgot to put the brakeline holders in. _at_#$%!).  Three steps forward,
one back.
