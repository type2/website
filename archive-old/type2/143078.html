Subject: Parting a 71

I've come to a point where I have to give up my 71 deluxe. I'm not happy
about it but that's life.

So, before removing it from my garage, how much of it can I salvage to fix
up my 73? Front doors? Sliding door? I figure dash parts and windows will be
interchangeable. I'm also thinking about cutting off the top and making it
interchangeable with my hightop. If the dimensions are right, it's a go.
Same with the windshield frame.

The deluxe trim in all the window rubber is near perfect, as are the wing
windows (!). The one rear wing in my 73 will get swapped, but the two middle
ones are sweet. I just like my sliders more. Too bad the trans isn't
swappable. heh The body deluxe trim is good, but some bad spots that
probably can be worked out are there. The deluxe front bumper is nice too.
No rear though.

Anyway, once I pull off whatever I want (or sell/give away), how do I unload
the chassis? Will a scrap metal dealer just come take it away? I have no
title so I can't have a junkyard take it.

(Chris? Want it for BB when I'm done?)

Thoughts?
