I appreciate Folly's carbs are no where near &quot;tuned&quot;...  and she is running
rough... but how does gas get into the oil?  The Folly's oil has so much oil
in it... it has thinned considerably.

Is this a result of Folly's rich running lifestyle ? 

And where does one begin to tune the mysterious stock carbs on her 1700cc
type IV??  What would be the first step?

Plase and thank yous always!
