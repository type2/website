Subject: Re: [T2] part # ID whatizit

i found out what this wacky plastic gizmo is (part # below):
in the 68-70 manual it notes this as an accelerator pedal stop. never
seen/heard such a thing! have you? do other folks have them - are they
useful? i don't see holes in the floor for them in my 75, but plain as day
two exist in the 68. loopy.      - steve

&gt;&gt; 1/2&quot; X 1/2&quot; X 2&quot;; plastic; and it has 2 split 3/8&quot; prongs. odd looking
&gt;&gt; gizmo, until it fits into something :)            - steve
