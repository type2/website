Subject: Re: [T2] Cold breeze

What year is your Westy? I'm trying to figure out a way to set-up a sheet or 
something that will prevent the heat from being sucked out through the back 
of the roof.

I know it's a little different from what your problem is, but I solved one 
of the the cold breezes in mine by simply pulling the curtains to. Makes it 
a little hard to see sometimes, but it made a pretty big difference this 
past weekend.

&gt;I have replaced all of the seals on my Westy. The doors, and both rear
&gt;hatches, and all of the pop top seals. It was around 36 degrees yesterday 
&gt;and
&gt;it was actually warm in the bus until I got above 40mph. Then this ice cold
&gt;breeze starts coming in through the pop top.
&gt;
&gt;There was some cold air coming before I replaced the seal, but now it is
&gt;worse with a new seals.
&gt;
&gt;It seems the top is not as snug as it was before, like the seal is propping
&gt;it up.
&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts on how to fix this or at least block the air? I would like to 
&gt;be
&gt;able to drive faster the 40mph and still not freeze.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
