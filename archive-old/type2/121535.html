Subject: Re: [T2] Custom &amp; Commercial Wheel Lives On in The 909

&gt;Chris M. - is that enough material content for ya?  :-)

Huh? What? Did somebody say anything to me???

I'm in the depths of the Corvair transplant and it's making my head hurt! 
&lt;grin&gt; Oh and frostbite b/c the garage ain't insulated. 20 degrees outside 
equals 35 inside... &lt;grin&gt; Were it my garage it would be insulted!

I bought way back when -  the early baywindow Trans-vair kit from a friend 
and I'm having to adapt it to my late baywindow bus. All the mounts are 
different.

I think I've got it now though. I'll be ready to fire it up tonight or 
tomorrow.

OH! So we're talking wheels now? Okay... Sounds good to me. When my budget 
catches up with my planning sheet I'm going to do it. Saw some nice 15&quot; 
tires at Sam's Wholesale over the holidays. I think they were even rated 
high enough. Dunlops.
