Subject: [T2] hydraulic valve noise??

I need some experience, insight and or opinions.  There never seems to be a 
shortage of any of these on the list ; ).

I finished an install of a type IV engine with hydraulic lifters this 
afternoon.  The engine has about 500 miles on a rebuild and has not been 
started for a year.  When I turned the key, it started fine and ran evenly, 
but it sounded like someone was in there working with a hammer in each fist!!

I'm assuming this is 8 hydraulic lifters with NO oil in them.

What should I be doing here?  Idle it until things quiet down, drive it until 
things quiet down or remove all of the lifters and bleed them? (ouch, on that 
last one)

thanks,
