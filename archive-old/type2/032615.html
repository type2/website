Since it wan't installed from the factory, it could be anywhere!  Most
folks put it between the fuel pump and the carb.  Wherever you put it,
be sure to clamp the fuel lines!

There also may be a fuel filter in the fuel pump.  Newer pumps have a
screw directly on top that allows removal of the top of the pump, under
which is a filter screen.  Older pumps have a brass hex fitting that
unscrews from the pump body with a filter screen underneath.

Finally, there is a filter screen in the bottom of the fuel tank.  You
have to remove the outlet fitting to get at this (after draining the
tank, of course!)
