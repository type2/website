Pull that firewall. There is a connection there where mine had rotted away. Drivers side as I recall. There is another connection above the right top corner of the engine lid. Finally check the filler neck and the filler neck hose (at the bottom of the filler neck). All pieces were badly cracked on my '78. I too had the same problem. 

Really you'd be better off to just replace EVERYTHING that handles fuel and is made of rubber. 

Lots of time, not much money.
