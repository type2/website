was watching the news, that isn't Scirroco weather the only thing I want
to be driving in that wind is an &quot;M1A1 Abrams&quot;

&gt; &gt; Just wanted to get your attention. Though that's really how hot it is
&gt; &gt; here! LoL!!!

PHFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFffffffffffttttttttttttttttt!!!!

Ok to get some bus in here, Yesterday I changed out ALL of my positive and
negative wires from the batteries, really splurged and went to West Marine
and made a completely new assembly of #2 guage wire.  hooked it up and put
a charger on it over night,  this morning it was pretty chilly before dark
when I went out (ok it was dang cold!!!) hit the switch and talk about
spin that starter motor!!!  was worried the motor was going bad, but it
seems it was just the wiring,  also while I was doing it I replaced the
rear start switch and put in a battery cut out switch too.
