Subject: Re: [T2] Starter Question

Hi Zach,

The starter relay is to help provide more voltage to the solenoid, not 
to make the starter turn faster.

Before you blame the starter... have you checked the battery?


Happy trails,

&gt; Well after driving for about 30 min today, my starter was turning real

&gt; Starter Realy deal I've heard about? How do I find out if that's what 
&gt; I need, or if my starter just bites.
