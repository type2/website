Subject: Another Webber jetting question 

Dear List:

My Webber progressive came with an additional  (I believe larger)
primary idle jet which I still have.

I want to try it out to see if it helps with the classic &quot;stumbling off
idle.'

Can someone explain where on the carb this replacement jet goes?  In
other words, where is the primary idle jet found?  I have a badly
reprinted diagram that I can't read, and I don't want to start
dismantling the carb looking for the correct jet.

Thanks.
