You won't find one.  The rotor would have to be much, much thicker, which
would require a larger caliper to accomdate the rotor.  This may also lead
to other problems with wheel fitment, backspacing, and caliper mounting.

It probably is not impossible to adapt something - I knew one guy that
split his calipers (on a different car) and added a homemade spacer to
accomodate the extra width of the vented rotor.  Of course, something like
this should only be attempted by someone with a lot of skill and experience
- it's very risky to re-engineer your braking system.

The only time I have wanted for more brakes on my bus has been on long,
steep downgrades.  I recently drove down a 13% grade which lasted for
several miles (descending from Bryan head ski resort) and the engine was
not nearly enough to slow the bus so I was pumping the brakes quite a bit.
The brakes got hot enough for me to smell the familiar burning pad smell
that you encounter behind big trucks on the interstate.  There was also a
small amount of brake fade.

I rarely encounter extended 13% grades, so improving my brakes has not been
a high priority for me, but I suppose someone that lived in Aspen might
think differently.  If I were that person, I would first investigate
getting higher quality pads and rotors.  I use Bendix rotors and
Performance Friction carbon metallic pads on the Mustang and they are a
vast improvement over the stock parts.  After ten minutes on a road course
the stock rotors warped and cracked badly, but the Bendix rotors did not
warp and showed only minor cracking under the same conditions.  I don't
know if the same improvement could be seen with the bus parts, but it is
relatively cheap and easy to try, and would be my first move.

Another thing that is common in the racing world is ducting air to the
rotors to cool them.  Some highly exciteable people even install fans in
the ducts (hmmm... reminds me of bilge blowers in the heater duct).

Finally, in this bus-owner's humble opinion, slotted and cross-drilled
rotors are not appropriate for 99.9% of the cars on the road.  The only
reason they are being sold by the aftermarket companies is because they
have a high profit margin and, as George Lyle mentioned, they know that the
sticker-peelin, speed-bump-scrapin, fart-can-muffler crowd will buy them.
