Hi,

&gt; From my experience, the pertronix fits right in without any modifications.

 Yeah, me too. though I understand that there are two versions, for 009
and for stock/vacuum distributors.

 Bear in mind that you may not need the pertronix, if you're getting the
Tiger CDI. The reduction in current/arcing through the points should
make them last for ages (don't take my work for it, check with Bob Hoover).
 Even as the rubbing block wears down, you'll generally only need to tweak
the timing, not change the points, as they won't be pitting and the dwell 
is largely immaterial once you have the CDI installed.

 I bought the pertronix first (they are available in the UK) so I do have
both. It is tempting to do both jobs at once, anyway, so that the ignition
system is sorted, but the chances are that all you actually need (for better
starts and reduced maintenance) is the CDI.

 On the subject of fitting Tiger581s: can anyone offer input on resetting the
plug gap, as they recommend?
 I have been running with stock gap (0.7mm) but intend to increase it at my
next service. I have in mind to go to 1.0mm, the bottom end of the range they
suggest (0.040 to 0.045 inches).
 Any comments from those with experience with this unit? I'm running it in
a 1970cc pancake (CJ engine, stock dual Solexes).

Cheers,
	W.
