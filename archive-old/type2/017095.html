I think the best way is to remove the whole canvas boot and replace in a
professional manner - i.e. rip out the seam and replace with new nylon
screen material. 

However, when faced with the same problem as you, I opted for the quick
fix (at least until I have more time or have another reason to pull the
canvas boot).
- I cut our the remains of the old screen as best as I could. Just the
screen and only the screen. I want everything intact so I can repair it
properly if I ever pull the canvas out.
- I cut a piece of new screen just a bit larger than the current
opening  so that the edges of the new screen will be over a single layer
of canvas when I attach it.
- I sewed a piece of trim matterial over the edge of the new screen.
- I sewed the new piece right over the original opening by hand. It took
about an hour because the last portion required me to jump in and out of
the bus as I poked the needle in and out of the canvas. I think a
special curved needle would make the entire sewing job possible from
just one side.

Of course I can't unzip the screen opening like I could before, but at
least now I laugh at mosquitoes.
