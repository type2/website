Subject: Re: Bus heater (fwd)

Al: good news! I tried Alpi's who forwarded me onto United Auto Parts in
Surrey BC. Within one working day I had a relay and an air circulation
blower pulled from an 89 Vanagon!

This morning I installed the relay and the darn thing works! Very well
indeed -  the BA6 really pumps out the heat.  

I'd like to put in a good word for UAP who provided me with excellent
service (unlike Hayman's in Toronto).

They have a good many Buses and Vanagons in their yard and will send out
parts at a good price.


If nay one needs any tips, ideas, or insights on how the BA6 works, I'd be
more than happy to help.

Cheers - DC

&gt;Allen,
&gt;
&gt;I just spoke to my mechanic tonight, and can describe his oil
&gt;cooler bus heating system to you. He prefers not to further
&gt;overload his limited home-life with extra calls, so I will
&gt;describe his system. 
&gt;
&gt;First of all he uses a 'passive' external oil cooling system
&gt;rather than a full-flow system, as I have on my van (and he
&gt;constantly chides me about). I'll describe that first, then add
&gt;in the internal/external heat bit.
&gt;His passive system uses a &quot;T&quot; fitting at the oil pressure sender
&gt;switch position to run both the VDO dual sender (switch and gauge
&gt;sender unit) and the line going out to his passive coolers. 
&gt;He uses steel or copper 3/8 ID tubing to accomplish the local 
&gt;sections, and power steering or aircraft Stainless steel webbed
&gt;hose with appropriate screw-on fittings as desired or necessary.
&gt;The line from the T goes to two external coolers mounted either
&gt;under the car up in front of the trannie, or in the usual ugly
&gt;position on the upper rear corner on the outside of the bus. A
&gt;bypass manual valve enables bypassing them. The output from the 
&gt;coolers goes back into the engine compartment, and goes to a fitting 
&gt;screwed into the fuel pump block-off plate, as he has since 
&gt;gone to electronic fuel pumping, as have I too.
&gt;
&gt;The interior oil coolers with fan are installed when he goes to 
&gt;Alaska, and are described as follows-
&gt;
&gt;  He runs the copper or steel 3/8 ID lines strapped to the hot air
&gt;heating duct which goes the length of the car underneath to just 
&gt;in back of the front seat area (he has a bench front seat).Then they
&gt;run up into the vehicle, where he fits them to flexible power steering
&gt;hoses connected to the oil cooler. The flexible hoses allow him to 
&gt;place the heater/cooler in the front cab or in the back as needed.
&gt;He has the hot air heat duct under the car wrapped in an insulating tube 
&gt;wh ich covers both the duct and the oil lines for the interior unit.
&gt;This keeps the oil lines warmer. The lines for this interior unit are
&gt;placed in parallel with the existing external oil cooler system,
&gt;he has a valve to close down the lines when the interior unit is not 
&gt;in the car. He can thus regulate how much hot oil goes to both cooling
&gt;units external and internal. He also said he blocks off the doghouse fan 
&gt;housing &quot;with a rag&quot; when using the interior unit. Obviously he is in
&gt;very cold weather when doing this. I dont know how he blocks off the
&gt;air intake of the fan housing with a rag. Probably a removeable
&gt;intake cover would be better.
&gt;He says he has to drive in a teeshirt with the window open in subfreezing
&gt;weather when using this interior unit.
&gt;I believe him. He is good at what he does.
