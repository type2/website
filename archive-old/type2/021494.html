I have done the dual port into a T4 Bus 3 times for people in the same
situation,got a cheap bus and a cheap motor , but at the time I didn't know that
tin was available,, so I made it myself

I didn't even use a rear hanger bar,, if an engine could hang on just the trans
in a bug,, then why not in a bus

So.. I didn't know then what I do now,, but 2 of those buses went to Vancouver
..about 4000 miles from here.... and one is still driving around!


Just to add, I read once that if tin is too hard to find or make,, then another
option for the cash challenged ingenious folks is an inner tube cut and riveted
across the air space 

All I am saying,, is It can be done, and has been done with success before me!
