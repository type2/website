unless my DNS servers are lying to me there is no DNS for this
domain...no MX (mail exchange) record.  bustedbus_dot_com and
www.bustedbus_dot_com do not resolve.  i don't believe email will make it
through under those circumstances.

anyway i was just wondering if chris and family made it here safely.
i'll drop by some day and see if he's around and introduce myself.
