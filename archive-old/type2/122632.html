Subject: Fwd: [T2] Hydraulic valves or solid?

It would save a lot of bandwidth if we could develop one of those 
personality profiles, with twenty questions, that would just resolve 
this kind of question once for all. Something like: Which of the 
following beers do you prefer? (a) Molson (b) Heineken (c) Strohs (d) 
Bud.

People who like Heineken also do well with hydraulic valves; those who 
like Molson prefer solid lifters. Strohs drinkers are better off with 
DP 1600 engines. And Bud? Type 1 engines with really big overbores.

Mark Hineline

Do they make Strohs anymore?
