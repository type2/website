Subject: Re: propane furnace option

Hi Steve,

Sounds like a Coleman.  I have one in my Riviera.  If you remove the grill is
there a 12/120v switch on the l/h side?  Is the exterior vent about 6x9?  If
so, that's a Coleman.  If you'd like, I think that I've got a pic showing the
vent that I can send to you.

The bad news is that Coleman is no longer in the RV business so there is no
parts or service available.

Mine bit the dust when I neglected to switch over to 12v and fired it off. 
Melted most of the insulation off the wiring.  I now have a 10,000 btu
hydro-flame unit to replace it with.

To test it, all you need is a propane tank with regulator (like for a
barbeque) and a 12v supply.Should be a piece of cake.

&gt; &quot;4,000 btu thermostatically controlled outside vented furnace system.&quot;(i
&gt; just wrote that first cause I was memorizing it in my head from when I read
&gt; it!) Ok so thats what I have in Blue. Its taken out at the moment but Ill be
&gt; putting it back in soon. It uses propane and I am unsure if it even works.
&gt; The button or dial/button that activates it is unmarked and I have no idea
&gt; how to even turn it on. If you turn it and push in I can hear a
&gt; click(ignite?)  since there is no propane in my outside tank I hvnt tested
&gt; it. I also am unsure as to the integrity on the tank.
&gt; Is it wise to have a small propane tank &quot;inside&quot; the hull? Do you turn on
&gt; the tank and just leave it on while your using it or can you just leave it
&gt; on all the time(switched when there is no draw to the furnace or stove?) AND
&gt; lastly :) how can I dry run my furnace? would I be able to use the little
&gt; propane canisters (that i get for free from work.. :)
&gt; If anyone has this option and knows how to work it , P-mail me. It should be
&gt; more comfy working on Blue in the winter when there is some heat back there.
