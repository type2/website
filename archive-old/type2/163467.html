Subject: Re: [T2] key switch gone bad?

Hiya James,

I've gone this route a couple of times now and the culprit, in each instance, 
turned out to be the electrical part of the ignition keyswitch.  All you 
(may) have to do is to replace that electrical part of the switch.  Easily 
available at any VW oriented FLAPS.  But you will have to remove the ignition barrel 
(which houses the mechanical keyswitch, the steering lock, and the electrical 
switch) in order to replace the electrical component.
