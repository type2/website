&gt; &gt;that's the problem, No spark of any kind.!!!  engine was running', stopped
&gt; &gt;power still to coil, plenty of fuel, but no spark
&gt;
&gt; Then the quickest way forward is to swap out the coil. If you don't have spare you can check it with an ohm meter.


put my spare coil in, replaced the pertronix with points, and changed out
the rev limiting rotor for a plain rotor.

it runs, needs to have the timing touched up but it doesn run, started
right up, not sure if that solved the intermittent loss of power issuee
which started this wholee mess, but at least it will narrow down the
problem points to check.


thanks guys, more frustration than real issue (I hope)
