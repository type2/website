Subject: [T2] sump plate bolts stripped?


1975 bus, 1800

My sump plate, put on by whoever took it off last before i bought it, was
put back on without the sealing washers... the result was that both bolts
(little 10mm head m6 bolts i think) came off with aluminum in the threads...
so the whole actual point of this message is to get reccomendations as to
fixes - should i go with inserts (if so, where can i find ones that small)
or should i put some studs in and fasten the plate on with nuts?

any ideas?

thanks!!

bill martin
