Subject: Re: [T2] wide tire myth

&gt;I dunno, did you smoke your tires?  :)

No way. I need them to drag race on! Pa-dump. But seriously...

I actually did get a chirp (more like a peep) in my last two races. Without 
the layer of melted rubber, though, I'm pretty sure I could lay a patch 
about 8-12mm long.

Does that mean I should go wider than 205s? 8}
