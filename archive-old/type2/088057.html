Jim,

I'm using a MegaSquirt on my '77 bus. I love it! I wrestled with the =
stock FI a couple of times and was never pleased with how much time it =
takes nor the cost of parts nor the results. When I say 'results' I mean =
that when I monitored my fuel/air mixuture with an oxy sensor, I found =
lean spots that I could not tune out. I ended up setting it a bit rich =
to handle this - but that's not a good solution in my mind.

I just took a 500 mile trip. MegaSquirt performed flawlessly. 21.4 MPG =
cruising at 60+ mph.=20

I've posted before to this list regarding MegaSquirt - so search the =
archives and you'll find some earlier posts.

Here are the problems I had when getting MS up and running on my bus:

1) A couple of code bugs were causing me to get fat injector pulses =
periodically. This problem has been fixed in the latest version of the =
code (2.0)
2) The signal coming from the points is used to trigger the MS to =
deliver fuel - just like the stock FI. This circuit needs to be tweeked =
with zeners/caps/resistors in order to get the MS to trigger without =
double triggering and without so much noise that the unit resets. I =
modified my v 1.0 board so the opto isolator used for this signalling is =
isolated in terms of the input/ground - I ran separate wires on top of =
the circuit board. This ( and installing the MS unit outside of the =
engine bay) seems to have solved any reset problems for me.=20
3) I originally installed the MS unit in the engine bay. Here is where I =
had processor reset issues. I have since re-installed onto the back =
cabinet just above the engine bay. This move and the re-routing of the =
ignition input has solved my reset problems. Theroretically the engine =
bay may get too hot for the MS unit - but I actually moved it just so I =
could probe the unit more easily - to help solve my processor resets.=20

Overall - I'd say the MegaSquirt is the BEST option for an aftermarket =
fuel system. Price is great. Performance it great. Tunability is great. =
I'm sure that many folks that aren't familiar with micro controllers and =
soldering, etc would not consider this. But for those not afraid to =
tinker it's a great option!

Someday I'll post info to a web page with pictures and specifics about =
my installation.

BTW - I'll bet you could find someone selling a version 1.0 unit if you =
ask on the MegaSquirt yahoo group.
