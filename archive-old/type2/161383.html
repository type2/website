BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!

Wrong answer, Bob!   The loony is a ONE dollar coin.

Our $2 coin has a polar bear on it, and is usually referred to as a  
&quot;twoonie.&quot;

You're gonna have to come up to TCWBC, BusFusion or BOTC for a course  
on Canadian Currency.


Happy Trails,

&gt;&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The weather in Southern Ontario has now stabilized, and the weekend
&gt;&gt; is shaping up for a spectacular winter campout. The park staff
&gt;&gt; reports that about a foot of fresh now has fallen and there is 10
&gt;&gt; inches of ice on the lake; perfect for skating, pond hockey and cross
&gt;&gt; country skiing.
