Hi all,
   I'm collecting my parts and whits in preparation for assembling my 1979 
2liter.  Tom Wilson, in his book,  suggests packing the oil pump with grease 
to prevent cavitation at initial start up.  I've never done this before.
   I'm always willing to learn something new, so I'm calling on the 
collective experience and wisdom of the list.  Do you think I should do this 
or not.  What trials and tribulations have you had with oil pumps after a 
rebuild ?
