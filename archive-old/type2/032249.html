About this pump thing, I've just got one question.  What about every other
time you start the engine, ie when it hasn't just been rebuilt?  It seems
to me that the system must drain out after sitting for any length of time,
and then, other than a small bit of residual oil, its essentially got to
self prime itself each time the engine starts.  Now, I know people are
going to jusp at the 'residual oil' phrase, and tell me thats the
difference, but then why not just put in some residual oil upon rebuild?
And also, don't bother to tell me that the system never drains, since the
other end of the oil passages are cetrainly above the 'water table'
conststuted by the oil level at rest.  So how could the oil pump thing be
more than a ritual which none of us can really test the importance of in
any objective way?  Just my thoughts about the thread.
