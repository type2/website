Subject: Parts Numbers Bingo!

Hiya All,

I'm in need of another VW part number if one of you nice people out there 
could oblige.......

I'm looking for the number of the driver's side domelight/buzzer doorjam 
switch for a 70 Bus.  I believe that this is the same part and number for a 
70 Bug.

The switch is a simple two-pole switch but with four connections (as opposed 
to the passenger side switch with two connections).  The one I have which is 
clearly marked with the VW roundel has no nine digit VW parts number on it.  
But it does have 8842 stamped into the outer shell plastic along with a 
circled K.
