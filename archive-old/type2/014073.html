Subject: Re: [T2] Neat Finding


&gt; Porter-Cable is a division of Delta I think I found.

No, Porter-Cable and Delta are both sister companies under Pentair at 
this point, and neither of them so far is manufacturing any re-badged 
products to my knowledge, and neither of them so far has been the victim 
of &quot;quality drift&quot; I hope. Both companies make oustanding power tools 
and I hate to see them in a message compared in any way with the 
contemporary Black and Decker. =^)

If Ryobi is really manufacturing Sears-branded power tools then maybe 
things are looking up for Sears again. You all know of course that Sears 
was nearly driven bankrupt from replacing 1/2&quot; drive flex handles 
because the foolish VW bus shade-tree mechanics keep breaking them on 
their axle nuts and bringing them back for replacement under warranty.

That was my pathetic attempt at bus content.
