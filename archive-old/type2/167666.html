&gt; The engine is water-cooled.  The goofy part is the fact is that it's
&gt; got two cylinders, four pistons and two crankshafts.  The crankshafts
&gt; are where you would expect the heads to be (there are no valves or
&gt; camshaft) and compression is achieved by the two pistons meeting in
&gt; the middle of the cylinder.  Intake ports are on one end of the
&gt; cylinder, exhaust ports on the other end.


the olde OP engines, submarines during WWII and the Fairbanks Morse
railroad locomotive.
 wonder how it would fit in the back end of a bus.
