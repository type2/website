Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Auxillary battery

&gt;If you want to be able to run your gas heater and other electronics while
&gt;the bus is parked, then a second battery is the way to go. Wire it so that
&gt;the electrical components draw from one battery, but the rest of the stuff
&gt;runs off the stock battery. That way, you can run the battery dead, but
&gt;still be able to start it up to charge it back up. I would recommend a deep
&gt;cycle battery for the secondary battery if you plan to use it for something
&gt;such as this.


I originally had my second battery installed with an isolator in the setup.
I got a little disallusioned when my alternator blew and I didn't know if
if was possible that it got over worked.

So, I changed the setup. I have the deep cycle charged externally and
whenever I can, home, on the road at a site, I plug it in and charge it.
The huge deepcycle I have seems to take a lot before it's drained. It's also
kinda cool to be able to Boost yourself in the event of a dead starter 
battery.
