Subject: Re: [T2] por15

&gt;I have a specific question and need some advise.  I went to get
estimates on
&gt;painting my 72 bay window bus and found that I have a rust hole in
floor of
&gt;the front passenger side of the bus.  It is where the floor starts to
round
&gt;up towards the seat and is rectangular in shape, about 1/4 to 1/2 inch
wide
&gt;and 5 inches long.  Will POR15 work for this type of rust?  If so,
should it
&gt;be put on the both sides of the floor?  I have some other rust areas
about
&gt;the same size, but the rust  has not gone completely though yet.  It
will be
&gt;about $300 for the 3 areas that need work if I have the bad sections
cut out
&gt;and new ones placed in.  POR15 sounds cheaper, easier and more
rewarding if I
&gt;do it myself.


I have those exact same rust spots and will be trying POR15 sometime
next week.
I ordered the &quot;Super Sarter Kit&quot; (basically a trial sized version) for
$13.95, $20.20
after shipping.  My larger rust problems are the seatbelt bolt areas
(front as well as
rear wheelwells) and just under the brake fluid resevior (a 3 x 4 inch
hole.)  Brake
fluid reaks havock on paint, someone spilled.  But I'll give a beginers
report on my
experience on POR 15 after I try it.

Also, has anyone heard of a rust product called Jasco?  I've heard it
works well and
is similar to and cheaper than POR 15.  Any help would, at the least, be
informative.

Many thanks,
-PM
