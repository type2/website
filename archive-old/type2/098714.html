Subject: 4sale:Advwagen step&amp; deluxe trim (again)

List,
This stuff has been boxed and ready to ship for
months. I've had a couple bites but still have the
parts.
1. The retractable step from a 1971 adventurewagen. It
was painted white sometime back. The underside is
rusty, but the part is sturdy. I *may* have pics of
this part.
2. A set of aluminum beltline trim from a 71 bus with
30 or so good clips. There are a couple of scratches
here and there and one piece has a little gray primer
overspray on it. Securely packed in a big long box. I
have no pics of the trim - sorry...

Your choice - $25 + shipping - USPS.
--or--
$40 +shipping for both parts.

Help me raise xmas money and get these parts out of my
bedroom!

thanks,
clark gordon
