Subject: Re: [T2] idiot light

Had a similar incident a year ago on my 84 Westy.  Turned out the brushes
and the slip ring were really wearing bad (I guess I would after 22 years -
original alternator).  Would have just replaced the Voltage Regulator/Brush
Assy (specific for the 80s Vanagon), but as I said the slip ring needed
resurfacing, so I just put a Bosch reman alternator in to fix the problem.
Been fine ever since.

&gt; Hey, guys.   My idiot alternator light is coming on more and more at idle
&gt; lately.  Is that a symptom that the alternator is on its way out?  It was on
&gt; the bus when I bought it 8 years ago.  Where does it actually measure the
&gt; voltage?  In the guage itself?  The alternator still works fine
&gt; otherwise.  And I've got a good battery. Never considered putting in a real
&gt; voltmeter. May have to rethink that.   Thanks...KR
