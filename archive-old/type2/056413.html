Subject: Porsche 924 gauges in 73 bus - long
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I just completed a minor project that I conceived several months ago
while wandering through the local junk yard.  I have successfully
installed a set of Porsche 924 gauges in my 73 Westy.  Why would I want
to do that, you ask?  Well, read on and I'll tell you.

I had been looking for a tachometer to install in my bus (without having
to pay $100 for a new VDO), but was striking out.  About the only gauges
I found at the junk yard were in a couple of wrecked early 80's Porsche
924's.  Since the price for gauges at the yard was only $7 each, I
removed the 3 (multi with fuel and temp, speedo with blinker, and tach)
along with the plastic mounting plate that holds them in place.

These gauges appealed to me because all the dummy lights are there, just
like in the bus and so is the gas gauge.  But also included on the multi
gauge is a temperature gauge.  Nice.  Also, the multi and the tach are
5&quot; gauges (same size as stock speedo) so are easier to read.  And the
dummy lights are BIG and BRIGHT!  And further more, the speedo has a
trip odometer on it!!

I cut the plastic cones that the gauges slip into on the 924 mounting
plate off of the face of the plate.  Then I obtained a SPARE bus gauge
plate and cut circles to match the size of the cones from the 924 plate.
The center one was almost the right size, requiring just a slight
enlargement, but the other 2 need to be quite a bit larger diameter.  I
did all the cutting with a band saw.  The biggest problem turned out to
be the plastic melting and re-sealing right behind the cut.  I also had
to drill an additional hole in the panel (there's actually a spot for it
above and to the right of the speedo) to mount the bight-beam indicator
light (also obtained from the 924 donor).  

After I got the cut-outs and the cones the right size, I JB-Welded the
cones onto the back of the plate and then used a bit of fiberglass to
re-enforce them.  Test-fitted the gauges and was ready for the
electrical part.

First thing I did was draw a picture of the back of the original bus
gauges and labeled each wire with its position, use, and color code so I
can re-connect everything back to the original panel (safely stored in
my closet) if I ever want to.  This picture also proved useful during
the conversion from the old gauges to the new ones.

The actual wiring turned out to be a little time consuming because most
of the connectors for the bus gauges lights (at least on my 73) were
those tiny little 1/8 inch thingies while the 924 gauges use standard
1/4 inch connectors.  Since I had no desire to cut my original wiring
harness, I proceeded to carefully thread/twist/tape wires with the
correct size connectors to the original connectors.  Then I hooked each
up in turn.

Results:
The speedo reads just slightly low, like in the 3% range.  So 30
indicated is really about 31, 60 is really about 62.  Since my old
speedo read about 20% high (60 was only 50), this strikes me as
insignificant.  I had to do the standard odometer drive gear repair (you
newer bus and Vanagon folks know what I mean).

The tach is cool.  Well lit, spot-on for accuracy, 5&quot; diameter so easy
to read and its a side-winder so it looks like it belongs in a race car.

The multi gauge is really cool.  The oil and gen dummy lights are bright
enough to see in broad daylight.  The gas gauge seems to be just about
right, but I haven't run it through an entire range to check it from
full to empty yet.  The only problem I've run into is that the 924 oil
temp sender is apparently calibrated differently so at normal operating
temperature, the gauge shows just barely out of the cool range (I'm
using a stock 914 temp sender right now).  I'm going to get a 924 sender
and see if it is threaded the same - that should clear up that problem.

Overall, I'm really pleased with the results.  The total cost was about
$45 (including the gauges, 924 panel, and spare bus panel).  Total time
spent was about 6 hours - mostly spent cutting and fitting the mounting
cones to the back of the bus panel and wiring adapters so I didn't have
to cut my original wiring harness.  For the money/time invested, I got a
tach, temp gauge (I already had the sender installed), 3 spare holes in
the multi gauge for future dummy lights, dummy lights that can be read
in the day time, a trip odometer, and 150mph speedo.  Now all I've got
to do is figure out how to get the bus to go 150mph!!
