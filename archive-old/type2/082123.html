Subject: Re: [T2] hard data, and guessing games

&gt;&gt;  I reflect upon the the principal's of seat of the pant's experience--
&gt;
&gt; While just
following this thread w/ small interest I can see one small
&gt; point that I believe you are
overlooking. Your perception is that in
&gt; the engines that you maintain (and others
engines) you have not had bad

As the engine ages and the technology improves, it really
does become an improvisational dance. Just try to be consistent and
reasonably scientific(coming from someone who used to add a drop of patchouli in an oil change
and kept a crystal inthe tuneup kit). There are many technologies (hydraulic lifters and
solid-stateignitions) that really improve on the engine, many of the old techniques
get phased out.Just the other day I was  trying to set my timing (after my Dad tried
too). Dad came up and said'unplug the timing light and tweak the distributor until it sounds smooth
-  keep tweakinguntil it's where you want it'.

Oil and additives become real voodoo with these engines -
as they were in my Porsche 911. Nobody makes an oil that works really well
in oil-cooledengines anymore. Except, maybe, the oil that Harley-Davidson sells at
their  dealerships.If you want the rundown on oil and oil-cooling, ask a hawg rider.
Persoanlly, I use the same oilon my Type 4 VW engine as I used in my 911 - straight 30 weight. I'm also
planning to add andexternal oil coolar and reserviour, like my 911. Will the 10.5 quart
capacity of thereservior and cooler of the 911, Porsche recommended oil changes at 15K
miles - in time withvalve adjustments. Of course, Porsche used solid lifters through at least
1989, so maybethey are better than hydraulic.

Do remember - if the dance is improv - you need to keep an eye
on the lead - your engine - to remain in step. You can't depend on the
prescribed footwork of awaltz or a rumbha - and you can't depend on the prescribed maintenance of
Bentley or Muir(although Muir says about the same thing).

&gt; things happen to them. Your
claim is that it b/c of the additives you
&gt; add. It's hard to quantify that since the simple
act of properly
&gt; maintaining an engine will help extend it's life to what it was
&gt;
designed for. I believe what you can claim w/ your experience with
&gt; these products is that
you have seen no detrimental effects to using
&gt; them. This is a good claim, I would hate to
put something in my engine
&gt; which causes it harm. I believe what dr tim is saying that
without
&gt; tests in a controlled fashion it's hard to tell if you get something
&gt; positive
from them. A request for hard evidence could be as simple as
&gt; running 2 identical engines
side-by-side non stop and checking if
&gt; there are any noticable differences after
different amounts of time.
&gt; It's not unreasonable to ask.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The Wright Bros,
flew an aircraft, with no data whatsoever----It was
&gt;&gt; their own failures,and
accomplishment's-- that they accomplished was
&gt;&gt; what they were there to do--fly---no wriiten
data
&gt;&gt; Not so far, not too long but they did it through their seat of the
&gt;&gt; pant
determination---no data, only  the input supplied from Clair
&gt;&gt; Chanute, who was
experimenting with unpowered glider's---the rest was
&gt;&gt; all on their own--trial and error---

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Same with Edison and the light bulb--Marconi with the radio, and a
&gt;&gt; whole broad
expanse of other's in the early days of trial and
&gt;&gt; error---zero documented data---
&gt;
&gt;
these aren't quite in the same arena. Look at them from this
&gt; viewpoint. with the wright
bros, it was quite easy to see that it flew
&gt; at Kitty Hawk. Edison? would have been easy to
&quot;see&quot; that the light
&gt; bulb he worked on worked (no he didn't invent it) Marconi as well.
