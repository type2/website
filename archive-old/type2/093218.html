Ewwww!  Yes, you need new fluid!  Here's what to do:

Go buy a couple of pints of brake fluid.  You can use the stuff from STP at 
your FLAPS, or you can get some better fluid (Motul, ATE) if you want a 
higher boiling point.  Since you're area is not mountainous (sorry, hill 
country isn't mountainous :-&gt;) you will probably be okay with the FLAPS stuff.

Buy a $1.00 turkey baster at the 99-cent store.

Suck the old fluid (okay, allow atmospheric pressure to push it :-&gt;) out of 
the master cylinder reservoir.  When it is as empty as you can get it, fill 
the reservoir with new fluid.

Bleed each wheel until you see new fluid.  This is really easy if you use 
the ATE fluid and alternate between blue and amber colors every time you 
replace your brake fluid.  :)  Of course start with the right rear, then 
left rear, then right front, then left front.

Done!  Put the remaining half-bottle in the bus somewhere for emergencies.
