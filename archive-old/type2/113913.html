Unfortunately, you are playing with fire if you stray from the OE setup.  This is because there is only so much cooling air available through that little duct, and generating more power will also generate more heat.  More wire in the same case also probably means less airspace inside for the precious cooling air to travel.  Get that alternator rewound and I bet it will not last long.  Do you want a few more amps or OE reliability?

I have only met one person who carries more batteries in their bus than I do, and I have always made do with the stock 55-amp Bosch alternator.  I have tried to explain in the past why a larger alternator is not &quot;the answer&quot; to charging an aux battery.  It's all about sustained load - a 2nd battery will not increase sustained load beyond the capacity of the stock alternator in most cases.
