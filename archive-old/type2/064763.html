Subject: Re: Help Vacuum Leak Checking

Thanks for the responses on vacuum leak check techniques.
So far the suggestions include:
Propane, WD-40, Starting Fluid, Various Carb Cleaners, Gumout, &amp; last 
but not least, Hairspray.  Anything else?
I see a trend here, hmmm, something that will ignite and change the 
engine RPM's.  Yes, TVII Bill, I'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.
So on my list for things to do while going home tonight I wrote:
&quot;Something flammable with a nozzle&quot;
I also have a product that I'll try tonight for sealing those pesky 
leaks, I keep you posted on results of THAT experiment.
