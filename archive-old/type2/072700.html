&gt;&gt; Why would you want to go through undoing the CV joints, linkage etc, to
&gt;&gt; pull the tranny just to get the engine out.  I don't understand.

&gt;    Well, I didn't believe it either, but David convinced me to try it,
&gt;and now that I have, I can say it's worth it just because putting it
&gt;back in is so much easier.
&gt;    This is on a T4, not the T1 on the earlier buses. On my '69, with
&gt;the removable rear member, you could slide the engine right in and out,
&gt;but on the T4's it is a major hassle for me to do it. Having the engine
&gt;and tranny together when you put it back is just much, much easier.
&gt;     I once pulled the engine in my '69 four times in one afternoon, and
&gt;had it back in and running each time -- no big deal. On my T4 it's a all
&gt;day affair for even once in and out -- just a lot more weight to try to
&gt;balance and you can't slide it in and out, and there's not really quite
&gt;enough room to work with.

I still don't understand why you would go to the trouble of pulling the
trans.  I just pulled my engine to replace with a rebuilt new one.  It took
me less than 20 minutes.  Undo 4 bellhousing to engine bolts, 4 carrier
bolts, 2 pcs of rear tin, oil filler extension, coil, and misc wires.
Wiggle engine out of bell housing an inch or two and slowly drop while
pulling backwards.  Its a little tight but it comes right out.

I have a &quot;harbor freight&quot; tranny adapter for my jack which I use on the
return trip, because you can adjust the angle of the engine better so it go
right in.  20 minutes out,  20 minutes in.

I used to have a T3 sq back that you had to take the tranny out with the
engine but it only had three points of mounts.  Two in the back of the
engine and one on the front of the tranny.  Because of the D Jetronic
problems I got quite adept at pulling it also.  One time when I was taking
a trip to Canada I threw a valve head.  Pulled it home, pulled the engine,
rebuilt it and was back on the  road the next day.  It got to where I could
get it in and out like it had a zipper on it.

Have fun
