Subject: +AFs-T2+AF0- Hard shifting


+AD4-Folks,
+AD4-   I've been having a problem shifting in my '78 Westy. The odd part (to me
+AD4-at least) is that it shifts fine when it's cold, it gets harder and harder
+AD4-as I drive. The shifter seems a bit sloppy too, I was going to investigate
+AD4-that this weekend, could that be the root cause of the hard shifting?
+AD4-

Hi Rob

Did you get any responses to your query. I've got much the same problem
which I'd like some help on.

My van is hard to get into 1st and 2nd gears. Sometimes it helps if I first
of all get into second (with difficulty) or else 1st is impossible. This can
be embarassing at traffic lights fumbling to get moving.

I've tried adjusting the shifter using the two bolts on the cab floor. My
Haynes manual says the lower part of the shifter should be vertical viewed
along the length of the van and slanted backwards 30 degrees, when its in
2nd gear. I tried to adjust it and it got worse+ACE-

I'm assuming some parts are worn and need replacing. How can I check for
this - anybody?

Thanks

Andy Vevers
