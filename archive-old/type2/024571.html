&gt;&gt;	Hello Everybody.....I just recieved a sale catalog from Harbor
&gt;&gt;Fright tools. They have an engine stand for under $40.00. Is there any
&gt;&gt;reason why this would not work for my 1600dp engine? I have seen the VW
&gt;&gt;specific one that bus depot and others sell for $70.00 and up. Just trying
&gt;&gt;to save some cash .

&gt;  I took an old 091 bellhousing (used
&gt;the 091 cause I had it but an 002 would work fine as long as you are
&gt;only using smaller clutches) sawzalled half of the bellhousing away
&gt;down about 3 inches (to an appropriately placed reinforcing rib) then
&gt;was able to bolt the bellhousing using 4 existing bolt locations right to
&gt;the real heavy duty engine stand mounting plate with only some minor
&gt;filing of the grooves in two spots on the mounting plate to accomadate
&gt;the VW bellhousing bolt pattern, didn't even have to get out a drill.
&gt;

I did the same thing with an002 bellhousing from my 70 Bus when the trans
locked up. I put a 091 in the Bus and used the bellhousing for my engine
stand. Works so nice, my second engine stand will be used for an engine
run/dyno stand. I will be using the bellhousing off my bad Bug trans after I
replace it.
