Good to hear you are satisfied on your caliper  (I cut my finger last night, 
and typing is a bit strange for me this morning!!)

I BELIEVE the calipers for the '71 and '72 are a smaller size than the ones 
for the '73 - '84.  (See Ron's BusDepot page.  Search on 'caliper')

Some people would prefer the larger '73 - '8X calipers and associated pads.  
But what about the rotors; does the '71 rotor fit with the '73 - '8X 
caliper.  Possibly NOT..

I called my East coast auto store - Trak Auto.  While they have rebuilds for 
my '78, they cannot get the '71 calipers.  (comparable prices, you $$ quote 
and what I was quoted for my '78 calipers).  CANNOT GET!!  And they have 
MANY parts for my '78, like boots, ignition wire sets, brake pads, caliper 
rebuild kits!!,  etc..

Call your Advantage back, and MAKE SURE the calipers are for a '71.  Then 
ask them if these calipers will fit a '78 (or so).  If they say YES, you got 
problems....

And DO NOT take your calipers apart.  That is, keep it as ONE solid unit, 
don't take the bolts apart that would separate the two sides of one caliper. 
  If you do, Advantage MAY NOT take that caliper as a core.  It was 
contaminated, in their eyes.  Actually, the rebuild is so simple, that it is 
not be worth their labor to get these two halves back together.

Another thing:  there are two types of calipers for my '78; Girling and ATE. 
I don't know about the '71, smaller calipers.
