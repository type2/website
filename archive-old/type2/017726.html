Subject: Name this carburetor?
Message-ID: &lt;371A73EB00065CAD_at_mail.murraystate_dot_edu&gt; (added by postmaster_at_mail.murraystate_dot_edu)

The PO installed a single carburetor from a Mustang on Maureen's 2L.  I
finally figured how to get it out.  It's filthy but looks OK.  I would like
at least to try to get it working properly but don't know specifically what
type of carburetor it is.  So if you can help, please reply by p-mail.
Thanks muchly.

Please don't tell me &quot;he shoulda kept the FI&quot; or &quot;get dual
Kadrons/Webers/Etc.&quot;.  I know and agree, but the first is wishful thinking
and the latter isn't an option at this time.

Carb has:

2 bbl with square ports w/rounded corners, 1.48&quot; inside dimension.  Number
&quot;5&quot; stamped into each butterfly.

Tag screwed to top is stamped &quot;77343&quot; and then in slightly smaller numbers
&quot;1368&quot;

Bottom back of body, at base, stamped &quot;R7343&quot;

Underside of top plate stamped &quot;IR-1296 B&quot;

Near fuel inlet at right side stamped &quot;I2R-5766 B&quot;

Air cleaner gasket is diamond-shaped with rounded ends.  Air cleaner was
cribbed up by the PO.

Again, many thanks
P'rfesser
72 bus, &quot;Maureen&quot;
