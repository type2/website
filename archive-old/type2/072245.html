just about ready to pour a little gas into the 68, and give it a go. found
a gremlin i wonder about - any help? has to do with a bit of a vagueness in
the bentley diagram:

i have 2 posts that needs a wire! there's a +/- behind the fuel gauge which
i suspect is for the --- fuel gauge. the brown wire in the main bundle
comes from the fuel sending unit.  it being brown i am putting money on the
neg post. what goes on the + post? my guess on that is juice from the #2
fuse, but again, not sure. between this + and #2 fuse, i have juice linked
to the blinkers. in other words, a black wire from #2, to both blinkers,
and the mystery + behind the fuel gauge. this is the best i can get from
bentley.

as it is i had blinkers working, and emergency flasher flashing, with the
exception on the blink both green arrows were on. during testing (which
means using the turn signal/emergency flasher, and checking lights) i lost
both blinkers and flashers and now have none. does this sound to you like a
bad ground, or more.   going for gas - steve
