Hey Volks

Well I have a wee lil problem!  This past weekend being the nice guy that I
am I decided to try (keyword try) and teach my lovely better half how to
drive my bus so that she too could understand and experience the joys of
puttering along holding up traffic (because you don't care how long it takes
to get where you are goin) drivin a bay window bus. Well after lots of
clutch poppin and grindin gears I went to drive it today and it was
extremely hard to find the gears. So I stopped thinkin maybe the clutch
needed adjusting, after ruling that out because I recently replaced the
cable and it was great before the weekend I got back in to keep goin. And no
first or second gear,  third and fourth and reverse are fine but no 1 or 2 .
Well 3 and 4 aren't quite ok there is about a foot play side to side on the
gear shift. Any ideas ??????????????
Is my gearbox shot
I haven't had any experience with tranny work so I am quite lost!!!!!!

Any suggestions are and will be greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance
