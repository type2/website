Subject: Clutch Cable Died, I think
Message-Id: &lt;2.2.32.19991111050326.008a77a0_at_206.165.6.151&gt;

My clutch pedal is flat on the floor. Does not want to come back to Momma. I
was able to get Vandela home, thanks to idly perusing Muir in bathtub years
ago. I remembered that it could be done. However, I think I'll let AAA tow
it to Chip the mechanic. My instincts and sense of timing aren't good enough
to get me through Tucson rush hour traffic tomorrow morning.

Does it sound more serious than a broken cable? Does it sound like a broken
cable?? It was acting a little sensitive the past couple of days, didn't
want to go into first or reverse. The clutch was new about 5,000 miles ago.

By the way, I bought a pair of new dual carbs from Ron Salmon. The service
was great, they got here when promised. The difference in performance is
unbelievable. Yah, I know I need a new engine (compression is 60 all the way
around) but it runs (or did until tonight) like a top.

Any clues about the clutch cable are appreciated.

Thanks!
