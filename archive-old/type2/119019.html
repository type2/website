Subject: Re: [T2] voltage regulator toasted

Now I'm worried. My 70 Type 2 which I bought new has the original generator
and VR (149,000 miles). I've spent several months redoing the engine (new
heads, case, P&amp;C's, cam, etc. It is pretty stock except for full flow ,
balancing and doghouse. Before installing the engine I noticed a few rust
spots in the battery area. I am refinishing this area for about the fourth
time so I thought why not put an Optima in and forget about future
corrosion. From what you indicate I am in for trouble using my original VR.
Can I in fact install a stock looking solid state VR that will properly
charge my Optima or will this only work with an alternator.

&gt; If you've really stepped up to the plate, as I did, and have opted for
&gt; the spiral-wound, &quot;starved electrolyte&quot; type of battery, then those bad
&gt; boys require an even higher charging voltage than the sealed or
&gt; maintenance-free batteries.  As such technology has come into play,
&gt; guess what, volks?  The manufacturers have spec'd different charging
&gt; rates for their VRs - but we're still stuck in the stone age, or the
&gt; '70s (which ever comes first).  I have seen, but not used, the Bosch
&gt; solid-state VR that looks just like the old-school
&gt; &quot;dumber-than-a-sackfull-of-hammers&quot; Bosch VR.  Same external can, same
&gt; plug arrangement on the bottom, but pop them open, and it's different
&gt; world inside .........
