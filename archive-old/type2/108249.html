Subject: Re: [T2] Manifold Problems

I did this just a few weekends ago. What a PITA!  I also had a tough time
getting the manifolds off the first time. I took a rubber mallet and kind of
tried to knock them loose first to break any rust. Then while lying under
the bus I had to wiggle and pull *alot* to get them to finally drop. At
times I was lifting myself off the ground while pulling on them. The problem
is that the studs dont come down at a perfect 90 degree angle to the head so
they wedge themselves against the flange of the manifold. What is even more
fun is getting those damn things back on while trying to keep the copper
washer positioned right. Again the rubber mallet came in handy. Make sure if
you are putting the same manifolds back in, or any for that matter that you
lap the mating surface of the manifold where it connects to the head and
gasket. It only takes a VERY small dent or surface abmnormality to create a
leak. Ask me how I know.

Good Luck!

&gt; I have a 1978 bus with leaks between the exhaust manifolds and the
&gt; heads.  I have removed all of the pertinent bolts (and without even
&gt; breaking off any studs).  My problem, I cannot get either manifold to
budge.
&gt; It's as if they were welded to the heads.  Any suggestions?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jim
