Subject: Re: [T2] Need Help in Redding, CA - Non-VW Emergency

Mark,
    Thanks for your reply - the Subaru is a loyal (4wd wagon). I totally
agree that he is ripping her off - and am frustrated that i cant do anything
about it....

I quoted mom a dealer price of $171 for a EGR valve for her car, and $49.99
for a OE O2 sensor....she hasn't said anything about the oil pump though....

I just found out the guy doesn't even have a certificate/license through BAR
(http://www.smogcheck_dot_ca_dot_gov/stdhome.asp)...

I think she may end up having to deal with small claims court (not sure yet)
unless she can get him to lower the price before she pays the rest- because
he is BSing her. I cant do that over the phone, because i cant inspect it,
and my mom honestly doesn't know what TO inspect...

Thanks for the info,
~H~

&gt; hello Heather     This guy is a rip off     All the subarus in 91 weren't
&gt; inteference motors which means that the valves dont get bent when the
timing
&gt; belt breaks.  Now you didn't say which model the car was  but most common
&gt; are the loyales and legacys  all which have hydralic valves so there isn't
&gt; any adjustments to them .  they are famous about the oil pumps needing
&gt; either rebuilt or replaced.  There is a rebuild kit for them which is about
&gt; $12  The o2 senser is a single wire unit and can be replaced for about $50
&gt; or cheaper using a universal one like bosch # 12 o25  . I would have to
&gt; check the egr .but the most common thing we see is the egr solenoid which
&gt; sets up the check engine lite and cost about $100 from the dealer.   Later
&gt; and have fun  Mark Dearing
