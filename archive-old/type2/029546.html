&gt; What gives w/the cloth &quot;net&quot; behind the metal lining of the heat exchangers? 

Well... if it is what I think it is (the mat that sits between the outer
shell and the aluminum fins on the OEM VW heater boxes) then it is an
asbestos pad that VW installed back in the bad old days before asbestos
caused cancer.  It was installed to keep the heat from radiuating off the
box and improve the heat flow to the front.

I do not know (but doubt highly) if the Dansk replacement boxes have this
pad, or at least if it is still asbestos.

&gt;   I was considering trying to use some sort of cleaning solvent to wash out 
&gt; the exchanger &amp; eliminate any oily/exhaust particle buildup that might be 
&gt; contributing to my smelly, smoky dilemma.  Would this backing (&amp; baffling, 
&gt; possibly insulative, I guess...) be harmed by rinsing the exchanger?

I would say leave it alone.  DO NOT clean it!  If it is intact and oil
soaked and hard as a rock, that is *GREAT*... it means that it can't shed
any fibers!  If it is nice and clean and fuzzy, then it can and will shed
fibers and they have a bad rep.  If you have removed the outer shell and
can remove this pad intact, I would do so. Replace it with a piece of the
hard high-temp fiberglass board.  Or just leave it out entirely.  The air
you get from the heating system will not be quite as hot, but it was never
very hot anyway :-)

&gt; I went ahead &amp; tried my 'blow test' on the exchanger.  Just using my hands 
&gt; to cover the exhaust entry &amp; exit ports, I placed my mouth to the open 
&gt; exhaust port &amp; blew.  Once I'd adjusted my hands to ensure no air 
&gt; hissing/leaking (that I could determine), I continued to maintain pressure.  
&gt; For about as long as I could do that, I detected no noticeable decrease in 
&gt; pressure.  This tells me (I think) that I don't have a large hole in the 
&gt; exhaust.  

Sounds like the exhaust-carrying tube is still fine.

&gt; my exchangers have a little play between 
&gt; the housing &amp; the exhaust manifold.  I could see this working if I plugged 
&gt; the exhaust ports.  Should I have this space?  If not, how do I seal it up 
&gt; airtight (optimistically assuming I don't have to exchange my exchangers 
&gt; after all)?

I am not 100% clear on this... the shell is usually a bit loose on the
exhaust pipe.  It would be nice if it were completely sealed up and air
tight, but it is not the usual course of things.  I suppose you could try
a muffler bandage, I dunno, I have very low expectations in this
department :-)

&gt; Also, I'd asked about a sealant to use on the exchanger-to-heat flap 
&gt; connecting pipe.  Should I seal the air ducts coming off of the blower &amp; on 
&gt; into the exhaust, as well?  I'm guessing yes, but I don't feel I've 
&gt; developed an uncanny VW intuition as of yet.

Well, Karl sent me a tube of MB super gorilla snot that I am gonna try
next time I have the system apart, but the black goop that I think was
original was a high-temp RTV variant.  Check with a heating contractor or
RV dealer, see what they recommend

And BTW, I don't feel I have developed one either... but I have only been
playing with them for 25 years :-)  Maybe eventually :-)
