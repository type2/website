Subject: [T2] stool

Hi all! Besides spending most of Sunday with Bob in Baltimore rummaging 
through a slew of parts, I did do one other &quot;westy&quot; thing that I'd like to 
share. Sorry for the long story!
My dad came across an old westy sitting on the land where he hunts. 
Apparently the land owners had this thing hauled in to use as a dog house. 
Dad said its been in that spot for over a year and wasn't in too bad of shape 
when it was put there. (Note here that he never mentioned this to me...even 
as i searched and searched for a westy of my very own!)
He said the old guy who owns it would be glad to give it to me if I hauled it 
away. I went down to take a look at it. Pretty sure it's a 72 (although i'm 
not real great at this!) White w/Pop top. It's complete, but body is getting 
rough. And boy does it smell! It's got about two inches of soggy dog food 
sitting on the back floor. Gross! And the smell of mice and dog urine galore. 
Now to the point. As i poked around inside, I saw a gold vinyl footstool, 
sitting there prime for the taking. i asked, and i was given! Pretty cool. 
The stool was in great shape, minus the hornets nest on the bottom. 
I'd like to mention that for my trouble, I got Poision Ivy pretty much 
EVERYWHERE! But i got a stool!!!
