Subject: Door &amp; Window rubber experiences?

I would like to hear from anyone who has used the following 
suppliers for door &amp; window rubber:

BusBoys
Rocky Mountain Motor Works
Vintage Parts
West Coast Metric
Wolfsburg West

I would appreciate comments on fit &amp; finish, quality of material,
etc.

Dave
