Subject: Re: SOS from Oaxaca, Mexico

I had my 76 bus converted from Fuel Injection to carburetor, and the 
manifolds are simplicity itself-just four bent tubes with flanges at the head 
end, and rubber boots to attach to the &quot;chamber pot&quot; upon which the carb 
sits.  As I said, in ' 85,  Oaxaca was FULL of vw's, and every other garage 
in town is a vw place. These guys KNOW their vw's, and know how to fix them. 
Getting a temporary carb installed has got to be a possibility. 
There has 
 to be a mechanic in Oaxaca that can get this bus running and get this lady 
home! Oaxaca is where these things go to DIE,  fer Pete's sake.  Please 
advise her not to give up, and please keep us/me posted. Okay?
