Subject: clattering '72 noise--rod bearing or wrist pin?

well, i found bearing shavings in the oil this afternoon. :(

so, either the wrist pin or the rod bearing is bad, or both.  is there
any way i can find out which before tearing everything apart?

btw, the engine has never been really hot, and everything was replaced
when i rebuilt it 10k or so ago.

my nagging feeling is that the noise sounds too superficial and is too
clearly connected to combustion to be the rod bearing--but would the
wrist pin still fit the bill?  i dont know about wrist pins going bad.

now that i know i will have to tear the engine down, my main concern is
not letting this happen again.  what can i do to find the cause of this
problem?  i really, really do not want to rebuild the thing _again_ next
summer.  doing the engine yearly will make owning a VW ludicrous.

many thanks to everyone who took the time to try to diagnose my problem,
and confirm my fears.

i guess i will now just go and be sad.
