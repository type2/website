Subject: RE: [T2] Late Bay front beams, what's the deal with those?!?!

&gt;So far I have owned 3 splits, and 3 early bays ALL of
&gt;these had good beams. I have owned\seen only 2 late
&gt;bays and BOTH of those had rotten front beams.
&gt;Coincidence or not???

John, I have three late bays and none of them have an issue with the front
beam, so you may be looking at a coincidence.  Two out of the three buses
have been undercoated every year and that has helped out quite a bit and
even the one that hasn't been undercoated still looks good.

HTH,
