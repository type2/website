&gt;&gt;Done a little casual research I can share. The best transmision seems to
be
&gt;&gt;the late 091 4-speed as is offers the highest geared differential, a 4.57
&gt;&gt;in combination with a .85 4th gear. There is a .78 4th gear out there if
&gt;&gt;you can find one, but $$.

&gt;S N I P

&gt;I searched for a NOS .82 4th gear when rebuilding my 091 and I finally
&gt;found one (its the so-called &quot;fine tooth&quot; gear).  Didn't know of a .78
&gt;gear but a stock engine would probably have trouble pushing it.  In the
&gt;&quot;hilly&quot; country of Colorado, you're out of 4th gear pretty quickly as it
&gt;is with a new motor and the .82!

Good point, I forgot about the .82, was used in late loafs with 1600s along
with a 5.43 diff.

I read a review of the &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot; tranny that Transform builds, with I
think that .82, and they said a better solution would be a lower diff ratio
(which doesn't exist) since it makes a bigger gap between 3rd and 4th and
you spend more time in 3rd then you used to. They did appreciate it on the
flats at highway speed.

The .78 was used on the late vanagon diesel, 85 and up, if it had a 4-speed
along with a 1.7L or turbo. I don't think any were imported into the US and
you also had the option of a 5-speed with those engines so they are pretty
rare.

The ideal 5-speed IMHO would have 4th slightly lower so I could climb steep
hills in it, and 5th slightly higher so i could travel at 75 at under
4000RPM
