Subject: 1641 in a Westy

Hi to all,

someone posted a question about a 1641 in a Westy. 
I have a 1641 in my 1970 Westy and love it. I upgraded the 
motor with new  DP heads and utilized the oil cooler and engine tins from a 1971 bus (better cooling to #3 cyl.). Additionally I put in a 100 Engle cam, the dreaded 009 dist. and retained the 30pict carb.. The bus crusises easily at 65 mph.. I think an engine set-up in this way is a very useful modification and well worth the effort. 

all the best - Andy aka moriniman
