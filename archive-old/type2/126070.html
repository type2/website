Subject: Re: Installed my stereo yesterday...

I know this is blasphemy in some corners but I insalled 3&quot; Boston
Acoustics in the vent holes of my previous Westy.  I removed the plastic
plenum(?) from under the dash and replaced that with two PVC elbows that
blew the fresh air straight out under the dash.
I removed insert and the tin tube from the dash and seated the speakers
with minor adjustment to the opening.
I prefer to have small high quality speakers up front as close to my
head as possible to carry the high end sounds and loved this set-up.
I'll look for some pix if you want.

I'm still trying to decide where to put speakers in this thing. The
back is easy. I've got a 5 (or possibly 5.1 if I find a cheap and
decent sub/amp/crossover kit) switchable (stereo/DVD) system planned
for the DVD player. In a camper all the cabinetry is just speaker
fodder...

But up front? I picked these up yesterday. They actually sound really
good for $20 set of boxed speakers:

tail.asp?storeid=2314950&amp;pagenumber=19&amp;rapid=62553&amp;listingid=-2098065058
&amp;

I decided on these less for the price, but as something I could toss
in right now, and still use later (camping, swap meet, whatever). But
I still want someting in the doors... I searched the archives, and
there are tons of people asking about speaker mounting, but few
answers about the front cab.

Has anybody on the list got speakers mounted in the door of their bay?
Mine's a 73 (dunno if there's a difference..) and the doors are THIN.
I'm not seeing anyplace to mount in the doors, but would gladly be
proven wrong.

What I need is:
Mounting location
Speaker thickness (exact model numbers would be appreciated as well)
Flush mount, surface mount, or ???

Thanks!
