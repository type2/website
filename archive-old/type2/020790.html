&gt; Hey everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have a question that has probably been asked about a bazillion times, but
&gt; here it goes. I have a 77 westy that has a webber progressive carb on it. It
&gt; has a huge dead spot right off idle. If I don't pump the gas it will die. I
&gt; know everyone hates these carbs, but i had one on my bug and it worked
&gt; great(killed in fire of 1990). I also have a 74 westy parts bus that has a
&gt; 1700 engine with dual carbs(stock) on it. Should I tune the webber, swap for
&gt; the duals, or try to sale/trade the 74 which runs and is almost complete(no
&gt; it does not have a stool) for a set of dual webber 44's.  Any input would be
&gt; highly appriecated.  All this gas pumping is driving me crazy.
&gt;
&gt;                                                 Thanks in advance,
&gt;

Justin:
The original fuel injection would be the best choice, the 74 carbs will work,
but probably nearly as much work. FI might be required by smog rules in many
states, too. See if the DPO still has the parts, or go junkyard scrounging.
Pickapart places would be the best place to get them. Try for the right year. I
think 77 and 78, maybe 79 49-state versions are the same. Do you know if your
car was originally sold in California? That would make a difference.
