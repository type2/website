Subject: Roadtrippin' with the '71: valve surprises, &quot;the lurch&quot; AND free parking! (long)

&gt;So what are you going to do about the valve problem?

Chuck:

Good to hear you're making progress on the '79. Looked to me like you really 
didn't have *that* far to go with it.

I'm not really sure of the status of the valve. It's #3E, has been getting 
tight almost since the engine was new. Strange, considering it has a 
doghouse. Anyway, on my way down to New Orleans this month I stopped off at 
David Schwarze's place in Dallas (list admin) and checked me valves there, 
at the 3,000 mile mark. #3E was .003, tighter than it had ever gotten 
before. Set it back to .006, then finished the trip - another 3,000 miles 
through Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico ... all pretty hot places. Engine ran 
fine, little hotter than usual but that's to be expected, so I didn't think 
much about the valve. Got home on Monday and checked them all. That one had 
about .005 of *negative* clearance (in other words it was holding the valve 
open, at least when the engine was cold). I'm waiting on a borrowed 
compression tester to check it out, but after I reset everything the engine 
stills runs fine, still has four good pulses from the exhaust, nothing seems 
terribly amiss. If it is burned, it's only just started. My experience is 
that valve clearances get larger when the engine's hot, so I'm theorizing 
that even after stretching, #3E was still closing on the seat (albeit 
briefly, and probably not an airtight seal but good enough to keep the 
gas-cutting to a minimum). All this is extreme postulation until the 
compression tester arrives, so I will update you then. If it's more than 10 
psi below the others I will plan on a head job this summer. In any case my 
valve adjustment intervals just became a lot shorter, like 1,000 miles for 
that valve and 2,000 for all the others. As they say, your mileage may vary.

One bit of very good news: I seem to have solved a very vexing problem 
that's been haunting the engine for a year now. Occasionally, with no rhyme 
or reason, the old bitch would lose power briefly under load, causing her to 
buck and lurch and generally act like the Millenium Falcon at Warp 5 
(obligatory Star Wars reference). Never could figure out what was causing 
it, but it happened so rarely and randomly that I figured it was something 
I'd just have to learn to live with.

Well, right outside of Dallas on the way to David's it stopped happening 
randomly and began happening regularly, or shall I say constantly ... anyway 
it did it for about 45 minutes, right after I gassed up at a station that 
was being filled from a tanker (bad, bad idea ... if you ever pull into a 
station that's being fueled, pull right on out and find another. All that 
gas being pumped into the tanks is sure to be stirring up 30 years of dirt, 
rust and dragonfly wings, all of which will soon be coursing through your 
fuel system). So, suffering through this particular batch of petroleum stew 
gave me a sudden new enlightenment on the lurching/power loss dilemma. I 
started blaming it on bad gas, which is sort of halfway right but I had 
finally found the right highway. Now it was just a matter of finding the 
exit.

Chatted with David about it (nice guy, very generous, hospitable and he had 
a swimming pool. God bless him) and the discussion focused on the 
carburetor, specifically the float valve and jets. Finally this puzzle was 
starting to come together like the picture on the box cover and the next day 
I stopped off at a gas station and bought two bottles of STP carburetor 
cleaner (&quot;Use every other tank,&quot; it says. I'll bet those STP folks would 
really like that) and put one of 'em in. Engine did its lurch thing on and 
off for about 50 miles and then it went away, but that's what it always does 
so I didn't count my chickens. Somewhere around Baton Rouge I filled up 
again and put in the second bottle. That did it. Engine has not hiccuped in 
3,000 miles. So I bought three more bottles which are now part of the 
collection of ethylenes, asbestoses and other happy items in my spares kit.

I think there's a lesson here. Amid my nightmares of a roadside carb 
rebuild, coil replacement and who knows what other time-consuming and 
expensive repairs would be needed to correct this suddenly very urgent 
problem, I neglected to actually *think* about what was most likely causing 
it. Once I actually did that, I found the solution in short order and it 
cost $2.09.

Oh, the parking story. This is a great one. Found myself in Austin, Texas 
last week, which is a fine place to find oneself. Problem is, no parking in 
Austin. Oh, there's parking but it's all taken. And once you find a spot, 
you can't feed the meter. That's right, you have to actually move the car 
every 2 hours. Since I was finding it hard enough in the heat to even move 
*myself* every two hours, I was predicting my stay in Austin to be either 
very short or very expensive, once all the tickets were counted.

Up comes the meterman while I'm parking. Asks me about the bus. Turns out he 
has a '72 (there are 56 VWs in Texas. All are in Austin). We chat a while, 
he checks out Luna. Then he points me a few blocks away, to &quot;his block.&quot; 
Needless to say, never dropped a quarter on parking in Austin. Thank you, 
meter guy. You rule.

Keep 'em running!
