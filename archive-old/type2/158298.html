Subject: Re: [T2] Throwing in the towel on my louvers

Mine are fine as long as they are all the way open.  They rattle if less than that.  I have one slider in a spare cargo door if you need it.  That's a long way to ship it, though.  I like the jalousie's.   Cheers...KR

&gt; Have you attempted a rebuild of your louvers? It's a lot of work, but
&gt; my faith in them has been restored since talking to a bus owner while
&gt; I was in CA that recently did his. They move smooth as silk and have
&gt; no rattles, even when driving with them open.

I don't have my Bentley in front of me, but I don't remember reading a
procedure in there.  You wouldn't happen to have a procedure or a link
to one for this, would ya Don?  I already have too many pots on the
boil to do it myself this year, but so far my 2008 is pretty open :D 
My jaleous windows rattle and clatter from engine startup to shutdown. 
I like them when we're camping, though.
