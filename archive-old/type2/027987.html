Subject: Type 4 ?: Oil Pressure Sending Unit Options
Message-ID: &lt;GPNPHLFLDCCPAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Egads! the $35 sending unit I just bought to hook up my light and my oil pressure gauge doesn't fit on the '77 engine I have. Well, the threads will fit, but the unit itself is too big without extending it out quite a bit with a small piece of pipe, which I recall is not a good idea.

I tried the archives, but they're down. If anyone has a solution or suggestion, please share. I would really like an oil pressure gauge, but I would like to do it right, if possible.

Thanks! Joe
