Subject: Re: [T2] Rim Color

Before this thread gets too far, you may want to search the archives.
Searching for &quot;tire michelin lt&quot; will get you more than you wanted to
know about the tires (for starters, 93R is too low).

A search for &quot;rim paint code&quot; will get you the colour code for the wheels.

The busdepot also has an excellent page on the tires that will
probably help you out, even if you don't get your tires from busdepot:
