Subject: Re: [T2] knobs, knobs, and more knobs

&gt;I'm going to be installing some fog lights on my westie this weekend since
&gt;for the past three weeks I've been able to barely see in the morning, and of
&gt;course it comes back before I head home from work.
&gt;Are there any manufacturers out there that make switches that look like the
&gt;original knobs on my 77 dash?  The lights came with a lighted rocker switch,
&gt;but I want to &quot;blend it in&quot; on the dash.

My Beetle had a nice pull switch that was OEM VW. I think it may have come 
from a Westy camper from the early 70's. In the Westy I believe it 
controlled the rear dome light? On my Beetle I used it for a switch to 
control an aux reverse light as my Beetle had none. Looked nice, worked 
nice. I was a newbie and making the OEM reverse lights work was beyond me. 
Simple system in retrospect.

If you find the part# would you pass it to me. I have to find the same 
critter.
