Pressures seem right on, but the sudden drop, perhaps the bypass
valve is gunky and sticking.  You can pull it in car, BIG flat screwdriver,
it is in the case back there by the oil filter a 1&quot; or so plug with a slot.

You need a new crush washer for it and should use silicone to boot.
Pull the plug (some oil will drain out but it is above sump level so you
need a pan but don't need to drain the oil)  The spring should drop out
as should the piston.  Take a good size bore cleaning brush (like 1/2&quot;
round) and run it up and down with some kerosene, clean the piston
off with 320 grit wet/dry in kerosene, make sure the spring looks good,
put it all back in with the new washer and silicone, tighten it pretty tight.
It is hard to get that thing out, often a piece of 1/8&quot; thick bar stock ground
to a big radius on the end (you'll see how the plug is cut to match) held
with vice grips is the best &quot;screwdriver.&quot;

And stop running 10W40 oil, there is no place for it in an air cooled
or any VW, so sayeth VW in any manual later than about '78.  Castrol
GTX 20W50 or straight SAE40 now that summer is here, and I like
15W40 Shell Rotella in the winter.  But the shell (diesel oil) may not be
wise in a 140k engine as it has a lot of detergent that may bust up more
stuff than you want.  Cleanest engine I've ever seen has run straight
SAE 40 in summer and SAE30 in winter its entire life and at 90k miles
(parent's '77) still looks like new in the rocker boxes and still has perfect
compression all round.  Go figure.
