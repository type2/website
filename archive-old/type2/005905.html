Driving home from a friends house I look out the back window and see that I
somehow turned on my smoke screen...um....wait a minute, I'm not a spy and
this isn't a BMW z3...once I snap out of my fantasy world I realize that my
bus is having a problem...Before I left the oil was checked, and everything
seemed fine....Pulled over, I check my engine and oil,  dip stick shows
plenty (after it set a few moments) I deside to turn around and go back to
my friends house (about 10 miles).  I try to start the engine but it doesn't
want to start, like it's got no fuel, it begines to start and second later
*clunck...clunk...clunck....*   the engine dies slowly (not a clunck your
engines dead)  Try again, engine seems seized.

I know this is going to be something bad...so I have it towed back, and I'm
in the process of droping the engine....my questions is...does anyone have
an idea where I should begin to look for the problem?
