Subject: Re: [T2] Replaced heads, loose pushrod tubes

Daniel,


You always have to &quot;stretch&quot; them slightly before you put them on.

Bentley and every other vw manual I have ever seen tells you how and 
approx how long to make them....I usually use my long extension and a 
13mm socket to hold them inside while I *gently* stretch *both* ends about 
1/4&quot; or so....don't forget to put the seam pointing to the top side of the 
engine!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hey everybody, as always thanks in advance for any advice/opionions.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, still in the middle of my head replacing job (1600 SP).
&gt; 
&gt; When i put the heads on the pushrod tubes were loose most of them, I thought 
&gt; they would seal up when I torqued the head but they didn't.  I thought that 
&gt; i had the head on snug but am wondering if maybe they were not flush against 
&gt; the cylinders or something.
&gt; 
&gt; The pushrod tubes match the old ones so i'm pretty sure they are right.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Daniel
