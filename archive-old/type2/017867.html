Subject: RE: Fix that suicide cabinet on your westies
Message-ID: &lt;372EF505.36221836_at_supernet_dot_net&gt;

Responding to the recent thread on the right rear cabinet in early loaf
westies:

I used to hate the blind spot too in my '68, and although a convex
stickon mirror on the passenger side helps, it's still awful dark back
there.  If i *ever* get my 71 westy on the road, I'm doing something
about the cabinet -- basically the &quot;armrest height&quot; modification.

BUT

I'm NOT going to saw the original cabinet.  Yeesh!  The cabinets are so
simply constructed it's a no-brainer to make a doppelganger at the right
height AND you can put drink holders, racks, etc. in the top of your
&quot;shortie&quot; conversion.  I'll definitely share plans &amp; pix when done.  The
only real unknown I have right now is what height to make it.  For max
storage, it could be &quot;cut off&quot; just under the windows.  But a lower
version would give an armrest - in fact, at the right height I could
have a wider bed.

Sure, I love the suicide cabinet, and definitely used mine in the '68,
but I'm going to try an alternative for a while, and get a whole 'nother
window in the process.  If I end up not liking it, I can easily
reinstall the original, uncut cabinet.
