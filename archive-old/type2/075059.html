Subject: Re: [T2] first time T4 engine pull q's

Gotta disagree with Tom on this one.

VW had an off/on love affair with throttle valve switches (I am speaking of
the full-throttle switch on the throttle body here).  I believe they were on
at the beginning but I also know for sure that '78 doesn't have them nor
does my '79 federal model.

I remember my '81 having it though.  All the thing does is close when full
throttle comes around so the computer knows to enrich the mixture a little
bit.  But not all years have them.

&gt; Throttle valve switches were on the air-cooled FI Type IV's right from the
&gt; git-go and continued on through the Vanagon.  I don't know what
&gt; year(s)/model(s) go with your ECU #'s, but they all incorporated throttle
&gt; valve switches.
