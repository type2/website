For what it's worth, GoWesty's apparently overpriced wheel package includes 
15x7 wheels. They know buses and Vanagons ...

(These wheels were $360 last week; in a probable coincidence,  they raised 
the price to $380 two days after I e-mailed them asking them to explain why 
the wheels were so expensive. They also ignored my e-mail. I'm not gonna buy 
from them.)
