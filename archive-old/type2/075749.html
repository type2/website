Subject: nut size and Wurth Exhaust Paste questions

Hi,
Does anyone happen to know the nut size for the studs that go from the head
to the heat exchangers on a pancake motor (73 to be precise)  I wanted to
see if I could find the 12 mm head nuts but need to know the size.

Also I just received my tube of Wurth exhaust paste.  Anyone used this stuff
before?  Have any ideas as to how your supposed to use it or cure it?  The
instructions on the tube are written in another language that I do not know.

TIA

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
