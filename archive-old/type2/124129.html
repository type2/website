Subject: [T2] 1980 vanagon questions

&gt; am i correct in that all the HEAT air comes from that plastic fan and duct
&gt; contraption on the alternator?

Yes, that's the blower to move heat from the engine up to the cabin.

&gt; I know the heaters require some constant airflow, but isn't there a better
&gt; way?
&gt; or should I just install my small (18Kbtu) propane RV furnace and go
w/that?

I believe people have added marine bilge blowers to the ducting to provide
an additional, and more constant, boost to the stock setup.  You can
proabably find info in the Type2 or Vanagon &quot;libraries&quot; or via the archives.
Maybe try a search on bilge blowers.

&gt; can I add the front heaterassembly from a watercooled van to get a fan
forced
&gt; defroster? will it fit in the same place looks like it would.

Don't know.  The stock front fan just blows cold air.  You *do* get a fan
forced defroster with the current setup, but only via the alternator-mounted
fan.

&gt; 2nd  EGR,   mine was bypassed and removed, anyone have spare vanagon AC
EGR
&gt; pipes and stuffs? I'd like to get it functioning again to help keep
combustion
&gt; temps down and knock down.

The EGR valves themselves are NLA from VW.  The ones you find in junkyards
are usually shot (as are the filters) so the only viable source, absent
somebody with a &quot;good used&quot; stash are the vendors for the filters and, I
believe, one outfit that can supply rebuilt valves.

&gt; 3rd  DIzzy,  mine has a 009  I'd like to go back to the vac adv/ret that
was
&gt; original in my non-CA engine anyone have a good priced good spare?
&gt; should I just go to a 050 which is better set for a 2.0L FI motor  and I
plan
&gt; on installing a pertronix w/rev limiting rotor

By all accounts stock distributor, with or without pertronix, is best bet
for these engines.

&gt; 4th I plan on replacing the high pressure fuel lines, how do I replace the
&gt; short part from the injector to the metal line?
&gt; I was thinking of adding a mechanical fuel pressure gauge to give a heads
up
&gt; on system pressures.

I've never done it but have seen lots of discussions on the list, so a
search of the archives should turn up something.

&gt; the decelleration valve was bypassed, I plan on making sure thats hooked
up
&gt; properly.

It may have been bypassed because it leaks, and these too are NLA.
