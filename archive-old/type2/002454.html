Subject: Bus on a Christmas card

This should be on Friday, but it's the holidays, yes?

I just got a great Christmas card from one of the listees with his bus on
it, all decked out with lights and boughs.  It reminded me immediately of
the Christmas cards we used to get from our neighbor Karl Schaffenberger in
River Edge, NJ.  He was one of the three guys who did the pen and ink work
for the DC Superman comic books in the 50's and 60's, and he was a family
friend who lived down the street, working out of his home.  His Christmas
cards were great, right out of the comics.  He looked exactly like Perry
White, the Mrs. was Lois Lane, his teenaged son was Jimmy Olson, and so on.
Two guesses what the dog looked like.  But the best part was their VW bus, a
splitty all decked out with a wreath on the emblem and so forth.  I'd give a
fair chunk of cash for one of those cards now, but they're all gone.

Merry Christmas everyone, or however you whoop it up.  Safe travel and good
cheer.
