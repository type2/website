Subject: Re: [T2] Audi/Vanagon seats in a '74?

Howdy,
I have a 78 westy with early 80s (not sure of the exact year, pulled from a
wrecking yard) vanagon seats. If I remember correctly, they slipped right in
without a problem . I did, however, remove the armrests because in the forward
position they crowded the aisle and did not allow the passenger seat to be
reversed (door clearance problems) for camping. I removed the armrests and the
mounts (requires cutting/grinding) when I reupholstered. They look and work
great.
Regards,
Chris

&gt; I have heard numerous times that Audi or Vanagon seats can be used in a
&gt; baywindow.
&gt;
&gt; I am new to the baywindow scene with a '74 Westi...  Granted I have had a
&gt; '66 Westi for quite a while and is my primary work horse which I enjoy :)
&gt; Also I tend to end up doing most of the maintenance on friends' '71 and '73
&gt; Westis' so I am somewhat familiar with these &quot;newfangled&quot; models.
&gt;
&gt; So the question is how or what seats will directly fit into a '74 westi?  I
&gt; know the early bays had a weird passenger seat layout where it snaps in on
&gt; clips instead of being on rails, not sure when it switched to normal tracks
&gt; though.  Again people claim the Vanagon seats can fit right in, but I am not
&gt; sure.
&gt;
&gt; This '74 needs some help here and there, but should be great with a little
&gt; TLC.  Really the main concerns in the short run are the seats and a few
&gt; window seals.  The camping interior is in excellent shape!  The big downer
&gt; is that it does not run at the moment, but figure a few days work and I will
&gt; have her purring again (I am pretty good with motors).
&gt;
&gt; I tentatively plan to bring it out to Edisto Freeze Yer Toe in SC in late
&gt; Feb and if I get lucky the Dead of Winter campout in northwest GA in early
&gt; Feb.  Otherwise I will camp in the '66 like normal.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
