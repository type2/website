Subject: Re: [T2] electric fuel pump.

[...]

If there isn't a transfer pump involved to get the fuel to the secondary
pump, as in the case of the Vanagon, or a Bus the pump does both--it
pulls as well as pushes.

Where did you come up with this stuff?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On any fuel injected vehicle, the main electric fuel pump is ALWAYS below the
tank and is gravity feed. The pump is a pusher, not a puller.

Slide under any VW bus or Mercedes and look where the pump is mounted.
