I am having a problem with my camper dying.  It starts fine and runs fine... that is until I stop at a light or stop sign... then it dies... will usually start right back up, but sometimes.. will have to sit for a few minutes.  We checked, and the coil seems to be getting really hot.  So, we bought a new one (not bosch) and replaced it..... it did fine for a while, but now seems to be doing the same thing again.  It there anything that would cause the coil to overheat?  Any suggestions is appreciated.
