Subject: Barndoor: verification please

I'm asking the Barndoor community for some help in verifying the rarity of a
'52 bus I know of.  Chassis number is 20-021192.  Date of manufacture is '52.
 I took this info off the plate on the firewall.

I'm just trying to verify for the owner how rare this old of a bus is.  Some
experts in So Cal have told him it's one of the 10 oldest in the U.S.  Is
this true?

The owner pulled this bus out of Perris, Ca.  A friend of mine tells me it
was featured in an article in either DB and HVW or VWT back in '87 or '88.
 Sure it has plenty of rust but it is definitely re-storeable.  I find it an
honor just to open the doors and peak around a bus this old.
