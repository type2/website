Subject: 74vs78 vent flap controls

While parting out a 74 Westy, I decided to pull the front vent screen and
flaps to look for that little plastic ring with 2 slots that allows the
controlled flap to &quot;slave&quot; the other flap open and shut- this tires and/or
breaks, so I wanted it, since often, like mine, the slave flap never really
closes all the way.   To my surprise, I found both flaps in the 74 are
individually pulled on the inside via a double cross arm totally missing on
the later busses- obviously a cheapening of the later busses?   Anyone know
when this changed?
   BTW, the front vent flaps had rubber seals that were still good; mine
has foam that's mostly gone...tsk...tsk, VW!
