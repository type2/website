&gt; I must agree with George Lyle.  Nevada's stretch of &quot;the loneliest road in America&quot; is beautiful, and the nights in this desert cool down nicely.  Don't forget spares: tire, belts etc.  There is a reason why its called the loneliest road.
&gt; 
&gt; I would also recommend the Yellowstone/Grand Teton Nat'l parks north of Jackson Wyoming, they are incredible but full of tourists.

I tend to avoid the national parks because they are way too crowded.
Seems that if you really want to ruin a natural feature, all you have to
do is get it declared a National Park.  :(

However, the country surrounding these parks offers a lot of interesting
things to see while avoiding the crowds of tourists.  Going southeast from
Grand Teton you pass through Dubois (nice place to stay) and then continue
along the Wind River to Riverton.  Turn left and head toward Themopolis.
you'll go up the Wind River Canyon, one of the most scenic areas in
Wyoming.  Take a day to soak in the hot springs in Thermopolis.  Check out
the dinosaur center as well, the dig site tour is definitely worth it.
Just north of Themopolis is a RV park.  Drive on in and check out the
little airstream trailer that is usually parked there.  It's definitely
not a show vehicle, but it's been just about everywhere.  The road onward
toward Tensleep is also very beautiful.  Buffalo is a good place to stay
and has a really huge municipal pool (just about big enough to have
tides!)

If you prefer to go south from Grand Teton, you will find yourself in the
Star Valley, a very pretty agricultural area.  The main town is Afton,
which boasts the largest elkhorn arch in the world &lt;wow!&gt;.  The Star
Valley is also home to Aviat aircraft, the manufacturer of the Pitts
Special biplane.  You should also take the side trip and hike to the
intermittant spring.

Lotsa pretty stuff in this region.  We usually head up that way every
summer.
