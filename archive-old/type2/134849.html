Subject: Re:Interior paint

all the 68 -70s i have seen
&gt; were ONE color to the roofline.&gt;

Yes this is accurate. In addition I should have stated earlier that
&gt;Westfalia's&lt; were one solid color, not &quot;campers&quot; as the Adventurewagens, etc.
were converted transporters.

This is my favorite type of post...they are fun and nobody is frustrated over
a broken this or a non running that.
