Access Systems sends:

&gt; oil light stays on????  if the oil light stays on and you do that much
&gt; cranking then there is an oil pump/presure problem and the engine not
&gt; firing may have saved your engine,  oil presure light should go out after
&gt; a few seconds cranking

Do something real quick for me, will you? Take the oil pump cover off and
turn the engine over with a wrench. (Yes, getting to the oil pump on a Type
4 is a pain. Do it anyway.)

What you're doing here is checking to see whether the driven gear in the oil
pump turns. If it doesn't, remove the bottom gear from the oil pump and try
turning the top one with your hand.

Can you do it? The driveshaft doesn't engage the cam gear; use a gear puller
(or a press if you have one) to push the driveshaft down just a smidgen. (A
smidgen here is a quarter inch.) Put the gear back in and try to turn it. If
you still can do it, give it another smidgen and try again.

When the gear finally will engage in the cam, pull it back out, turn it 90
degrees and put it back in place. No, it won't go in. This is on purpose.
Measure the distance from the bottom of the gearwell in the oil pump to the
back face of the gear, then turn it until it drops in and measure again. Now
pull out the gear and measure the driveprong on the end of the shaft. The
difference between the two measurements you made should be just a little--a
millimeter is good--less than the length of that prong. Adjust as necessary.

This has happened to me, and the car's been running a year with that
repaired oil pump in it.
