Subject: Rear Disc Brake Conversion?

Hi All,

Excuse the band width if this is a dumb question but...  I was wondering if
anyone has upgraded to discs on the rear. I see a lot of busses with smashed
front ends, and a recent posting by unfortunate Jamey got me interested again.
I know the emergency brake is a bit of a challenge with after market conversion
kits. I am lucky to have front discs, I know, but would like all four if
possible.  Maybe I could snag a pair off a later model vanogan?

Thanks v-e-r-y much!

david.
74 bus.
