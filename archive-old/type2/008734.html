&gt; Hey, everyone! I just bought my first bus - a beautiful '78 Westy,
&gt; which the
&gt; owner didn't have the original manual to. My question is this: on the
&gt; dashboard, on the passenger side, is a green knob that's identical in
&gt; size
&gt; to the headlight control knob. On the front is an imprint of a white
&gt; curly
&gt; squiggle.  Anyone know what this is for?  My guess is a choke handle,
&gt; but I
&gt; can't find anyone who knows for sure. Thanks!

That is for the rear window defroster. The knob should light up when
pulled out and the rear window defrost, but don't be surprised if it
does not work. I have 2 Busses and both are inop.
