jess:
water hose it all down, get the fire extinguisher .
start by placing cardboard under the bus to
help indicate. does it leak with the ignition off ?
check for drips starting at the tank hoses and
trace them to the engine, and back if it is fuel
injected...
if no leaks, turn on key and check again.
then check with key cranking starter with power
disconnected at coil. no leaks yet ?
get a helper, it's gonna be a high pressure leak
when the engine is started and pressure is going to the
injectors, you only want to find it and shut down quickly...
this is obviously potentially quite dangerous, so be careful...
