Subject: Fixing Gasoline Smells

Here's a procedure that I used to solve gas smell
problems after a fill up.  In my case the tank
grommets and hoses weren't that old.  If your tank
rubber is ancient you may want to replace that first. 
I sealed the leaking left grommet identified by the
test described below. When I first dropped the tank
years ago, the Y plastic connectors were really tough
to get out of the grommets on the top of tank.  I was
glad not to have to try prying these out by feel (does
anyone have any tricks for getting these  Ys out of
the grommets?)

In order to seal the leaking Y/grommet junction, I
figured it was critical to find something that stuck
well and resisted gasoline.  I remembered a stiff
putty I had called green wax that was impervious to
gasoline. I don't even know where to get it today.  I
sealed all around the junction of the Y connector and
the tank grommet with this sticky green wax.  Because
very few compounds stick well to the plastic of the Y
connector or to the rubber grommet, I covered the Y
connector with RTV.  I used several applications to
build up a dome that stuck to the tank itself, and
encased the Y, green wax, and grommet.  The hardest
part is you can't see what you are doing, and RTV
tends to be messy when you are applying it only by
feel.

The compounds I tried that resist gas are RTV (once it
is cured), green wax, and J.B.Weld.  I would have
probably used J.B. Weld if I could have seen what I
was doing.

Fill ups now are free of gasoline smells, so I hope
this seal lasts a long time.  By the way, the seal
passed the leak down test, indicating the value of
this test for trobleshooting gas smells.

&gt; I've got a problem with my 80 Westie where I smell
&gt; gas
&gt; for 20 miles after a fill up.  This is happening
&gt; even
&gt; though I changed all the grommets, hoses, and a
&gt; cracked fuel sender about 8 years ago.  The problem
&gt; started reappearing a few years ago, so I probably
&gt; only got 5 years on the new grommets.  Usually
&gt; German
&gt; rubber lasts longer than 5 years!
&gt; 
&gt; I did the pressure test described in Bentley.  It
&gt; was
&gt; leaking air so rapidly, it didn't come close to
&gt; passing this leak down test, which looks like a good
&gt; diagnostic test for gasoline fumes.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to see what was actually leaking this time,
&gt; so I hooked the appropriate charcoal canister hose
&gt; up
&gt; to an inflated tire via a valve that was just barely
&gt; opened so as not to build up too much pressure in
&gt; the
&gt; tank.  The inflated tire gave me the ten minutes or
&gt; so
&gt; to check for the leak  Notice if you try this, do
&gt; not
&gt; use any electric pumps that generate sparks, since
&gt; you
&gt; will have gas fumes floating around.  By squirting a
&gt; bubbly type cleaner on the fittings, and using a
&gt; mirror, I found the leak. The single grommet on the
&gt; left side is leaking where the plastic Y goes
&gt; through
&gt; the grommet.
&gt;   
&gt; As I recall from last time, this is a tight fitting
&gt; Y
&gt; that would rather break than come out of the
&gt; grommet. 
&gt; Yet it has to come out before the tank can be
&gt; dropped.
&gt; It seems a real waste of time and effort to drop
&gt; this
&gt; tank every time one of these grommets and plastic Ys
&gt; start leaking.  Particularly when they are not that
&gt; old.  
&gt; 
&gt; CALLING ALL LIST MEMBERS:  What type of caulking
&gt; (like
&gt; RTV) sticks like crazy to plastic and rubber, would
&gt; seal this junction yet remain plyable, and wouldn't
&gt; dissolve away from the gasoline fumes?
