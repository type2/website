Doing your own maintenance is part of the Zen experience of owning a bus IMHO,
not only that, but by getting down and crawling around under, over and into your
bus, you will discover how elegantly it is engineered, how simple it is to work
on, and hopefully will get to know what things look and feel like when they are
right, so that when things go wrong, you can readily identify and fix them. 
Congratulations on this, your initiation into oneness with your bus.

BTW, you do need that screen on your oil intake tube, even if you do have an
external oil filter added as an aftermarket item, the screen will keep chunks of
stuff out of your pump and oil galleys that are located upstream of the filter
(I had a valve cover gasket crumble one time, and I was picking parts of it out
of the screen for about four oil changes).

Happy bussing,
terry
