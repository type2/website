A quick question first.  Everyone I have talked to says that I do not
need to remove the 
flyweel to break open the case.  Is this true?

If the answer is yes, than I have a non-rebuildable case and i am looking
to buy a short block.

Either a good used or rebuilt.

I have a 1.8L, will the heads work on a 1.7L or 2.0L.

Thanks,
