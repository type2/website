Subject: Looking for SHORTER tires...

OK folks, here's a new twist on an old subject.  Everyone is always trying to 
find the biggest tire they can run on their bus so they can have better 
cruising speeds.  I, on the otherhand, am trying to find the SHORTEST tire I 
can get that would have a chance of standing up to the weight and side-load 
stresses of a bus.

Why?  Because I stuck that 5-speed Porsche tranny in there a few years ago.  
That was when I was in Texas (&quot;They got big long roads out there.&quot;)  Now I'm in 
Colorado and that 1-28 mph 1st gear is KILLING me on climbing those dirt roads 
to get to the nice camping spots.  

Don't get me wrong, I love the increased gearing selections for climbing hills 
at highway speeds.  I love cruising on the open plains at 85 mph.  I love being 
able to PASS other vehicles when I feel like it.  I just don't like slipping 
the hell out of my $600 Porsche 914 clutch to get up the access road to Mt. 
Sherman (and many others).

I'm currently running 195/75/14 Yoko y372 LT tires.  What I'd like to find is 
more like a 195/60/14.  Problem is, the shorter the sidewall, the lower the 
weight rating.  Here's a brief listing of tire sizes and their calculated sizes 
(in inches):

size       width    tot. height       circumference
---------  -----      -------           -------
195/60/14   7.67       23.20             72.85
195/65/14   7.67       24.00             75.35
185/70/14   7.28       24.20             76.00
195/70/14   7.67       24.74             77.70
185/75/14   7.28       24.92             78.25
195/75/14   7.67       25.50             80.00

So, in conclusion, has anyone run across a SHORT tire with anything more than a 
1200lb rating??
