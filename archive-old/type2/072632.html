Subject: key / buzzer / ??

On my '71 Westy, I 'm tracing wires to solve a few problems.

It would help if I knew the electrical mechanism by which the key activates
the warning buzzer.  12V arrives at terninal SU on the ignition switch
looking for a ground. Somehow, inserting the key  provides that ground.

Neither in Bentley's schematic nor in my bus can I locate this ground.

I'd love to hear from anyone who has the scoop on this.

Thanks, Jack
