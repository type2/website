In the spirit of telling the good with the bad, my recent experiences 
ordering parts are here recounted:

MOFOCO: Ordered four KYB shocks, a tie-rod and a front sway bar mounting 
kit. My policy is that if it can't be screwed up (i.e. they are just pulling 
parts from a shelf that were manufactured by someone else) I'll go with 
MOFOCO. When the order arrived, I was dismayed to find a very beat-up 
looking box containing one shock, a non-adjustable tie rod and a sway bar 
kit for only one side. Upon investigation, however, it seems it was UPS that 
lost the shocks. They've promised to order three more for me, but I'll bet 
dollars to doughnuts I get the back ones instead of the front. We'll see. 
The tie-rod was my fault for not specifying &quot;adjustable,&quot; and MOFOCO told me 
to send 'er back and they'd put it right. They should have told me, however, 
that the sway-bar mounting &quot;kit&quot; only does one side and I needed to order 
two.

Gene Berg: Ordered an engine kit from Berg. It took about six weeks to 
arrive, but when it did, everything was right as rain and properly packed. 
This kit included dozens of tiny &quot;detail items,&quot; but everything was there 
just as they said it would be. That and the fact that Berg's catalog is 
packed full of advice and information about air-cooled VWs inspires a great 
deal of confidence is this company. The counterweighted crank is a work of 
art. I'm considering hanging it on my wall.

Bus Boys: Ordered a set of torsion arms with new ball joints. Haven't 
received them yet so I can't report, but the Boys do seem to have stuff you 
can't find any where else. I like that.
