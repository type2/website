The deal on the 4WD bay window.

There are bits and pieces of the story in Various VW books as well as 
at least one pic. The story goes that the original prototype was 
built by a VW factory worker on his own time. He vacationed each year 
in North Africa and wanted 4WD for the local terrain. Someone at VW 
got wind and was impressed. Suppoesedly the factory put together five 
prototypes.  The picture in Custom VW Bus Handbook has Jals but not a 
poptop. It is supposedly a 78.

That's all I can recall.
