Subject: Sources for Heat Exchangers &amp; Muffler for '73 Standard Bus

It is time to change the Heat Exchangers and Muffler for my '73 VW Standard
Bus.
Looked them up in Real Source and...well I didn't want to have to take out a
mortgage to pay for them...so I'm asking the T2 community for help.
Have any of you found reasonably priced sources for the above?

Thank you,
