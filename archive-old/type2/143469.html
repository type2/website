&gt; This just burns me to no end. Another case of a &quot;Brand X&quot;, &quot;Half Ass&quot;
&gt; repair shop giving the industry and Technicians in general a bad name!
&gt;   This is why some states are making noises about Licensing Technicians.
&gt; Watch what happen to the labor rate when that happens. Not sure how I would
&gt; vote on this one. I don't want Big Brothers nose in my shop, but if this
&gt; kind of thing continues to happen, he will be there.
&gt;   There are some jobs you make money on by &quot;not&quot; doing them. This is one,
&gt; repaired in this way.
&gt;   You should never have to weld a ball joint in. Its a sure sign of
&gt; something being wrong. They knew that. So the fact they did it, in the way
&gt; they did, makes them very dangerous. Not to mention the fact that some ball
&gt; joints have plastic parts in them, and that much heat would ruin them. Of
&gt; course they also showed off their welding skills. Their weld broke and the
&gt; ball joint came out.
&gt;   You say you place no blame. Well you should. You trusted them to repair
&gt; your to car to drive safely, and paid your hard earned bucks. Did your
&gt; dollars not work at their bank?
&gt;   This is why I say the shop that done this is bordering on the criminal.
&gt; No concern for doing the job right. Not to mention the lives they
&gt; endangered. You were carrying your KIDS in the car when this happened right?
&gt; So what if you would have been on the Interstate running 75 MPH in a curve?
&gt; Your lucky there 5 hours away!!!! Don't go back and warn all your friends,
&gt; and enemies for that matter.
&gt;   I'm not saying our shop has never had a come back, or a part failure. I
&gt; can however say that we have never intentionally done a repair that to the
&gt; best of my knowledge was not a 100% right. We make mistakes, were human. But
&gt; I sleep very well at night.
&gt;   Enough Soap Box for today. Please all, remember to use a little common
&gt; sense when doing, or having your car worked on. Especially on safety related
&gt; systems, steering, brakes, fuel systems, lighting, etc. Don't try to
&gt; outsmart the engineers who designed it, fix it right the first time! Quality
&gt; repair work is not expensive, its priceless!

Hey Howard    Man this is what burns me.  Somebody jumping on their soapbox 
and mouthing off without any facts.    Fact  he was 5 hours from home,  fact he 
was shown the problem, fact he had no more money, fact there wasn't another 
torsion arm around.  fact he had to get home.   fact  the choice was his to 
make and he knew what could happen. he made the choice. He choose to weld it in 
place and take his chances.   But what you are saying is that you wouldn't have 
done anything but push the bus out the door till he could get another arm and 
some how more money.   sounds like you need to keep taking lefts till you do 
get a right   later  mark
