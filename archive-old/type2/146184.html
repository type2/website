Subject: Re: [T2] need a starter in Las Vegas

Napa, Auto Zone, Advance Auto... 

I'd read up on the hot start relay as that may be your solution! And cheaper. Same sources if you use a Ford starter relay (which I always have with flawless results). 

I keep my cores when I shop at Advance Auto and Auto Zone (the el cheapo stores) b/c I think their rebuilts are often a hodge-podge of parts and worse than my worn OEM part. I keep my core, rebuild it myself and reinstall when the one from the auto parts store fails - usually in about a year.

The rebuilds I do myself last many, many years. Very simple electric motor that you can rebuild cheaply and easily using very basic tools. Try it!
