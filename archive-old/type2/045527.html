Subject: [T2] Vertex Magneto

Hi All, 

I just got home, I fought all day with this 'jewel' of a Vertex Magneto. 
I found it in a friends stash, it came off of an industrial engine. I 
asked what he'd take for it, and he responded: &quot;oh..  that ol thing? 
If you think you can it, just take it...&quot;  I came home and cleaned it 
up, apart from a few small oxidized spots on the outside it was 
like new! I took the cap ($150) off and found that all the fasteners inside 
still had a yellow paint seal on them, even the screw that held the 
points! On the bottom there is the drivepart that is like an adaptor 
between the actual Magneto and the VW engine, it had its original 
lead seal in place, a virgin! :-) 

I dived into the Industrial engine fiches and ordered the hold down 
clamp, it is a larger and sturdier version of the one that keeps the 
regular distributor in place (it won't fit the stock distributor). To 
make the unit like new I wanted to have it turned in a lathe, just 
to freshen up the outside, but cause I couldn't find a machinist 
willing to do it, I ended up sanding it with 280 grit sand paper and 
a block, it became like the brushed finish found on Parker ballpoints, 
and it looks like new, I reattached the model tag with small screws 
from a Porsche CD-changer, and it was ready to bolt in, I thought... 

I wanted to replace my plug wires as well, because the mag is 
higher and they had to be longer, I finally made cables using 
'89&gt;'94 911 cables, 914 plug connectors, and 3.0 911 connectors 
on the distributor cap side..  And oh... it bolted in so sweetly.. it 
looked so nice, with the dual dells it looked like it would fit right 
into Bill Fisher's book..  MMM..  :-) 

Ok..  ready to start er up!  I hooked up a timing light, and it fired right 
up..  I noticed right away that it 'missed' while it idled.. The tag 
specifies that it has a total 12.5 degrees advance _at_ 1750 RPM at 
the distributor, which translates into 12.5 _at_ 3500 engine RPM. 
As I drove with 30 Degs total advance before I timed to 5 degs BTDC.

The engine felt sluggish, unhappy with this new 'thing' stuck in it.. 
I revved it up watching the advance on the Berg Equalizer, it looked 
funny, as the RPM went up the advance followed..  but -seconds- 
later, it seemed so slow.. not like.. responding right away, the same 
happened as I let go of the throttle, RPM fell off, and the advance 
followed, but  s l o w l y ...  also it stalled a few times as it idled, 
&quot;Hmmm.. what could that be??&quot;  I made a wire with a crimp on 
connector, and stuck it next to wire '50' on the starter, so I could start 
from within the engine compartment by hitting the other end of the 
wire against the positive terminal on the battery. I held one of the 
spark plug wires close to ground, and it only pulled 2mm of spark!?
That seemed funny as I was able to generate a spark from it just by 
turning it with my hand.... Then I wanted to take it for a spin, just to 
like.. 'feel' if it drove any different, it didn't seem to pick up as nicely 
as it did with the 009 ...  It stalled and it was very hard to start again ..
spark too weak ... 

sooo..  after sharing all this..  (wanted/HAD to.. *S*) I would love to 
hear from any experience with Vertex Magneto's ..  How does the 
advance mechanism work? I hate to tear into the thing, breaking 
all those nice seals, and find nothing wrong...  Why is the spark 
so small at starting speed?  Any input would be greatly appreciated. 

I bolted the 009 back in, along with the blue coil.. shorten the plug wires, 
and it is very nice..  But I'd just love to have the Mag in there..  working..

Thanks,

Brian
