Subject: clutch problems solved

Thanks for all the replys to my clutch problem..   It has been solved.
Turned out to be the circlip on the end of the shaft had come off....
letting the rear drovegear fall off down into the tranny and also the
threaded stud that holds the two shafts together.  All parts retreived,
cleaned and checked and reinstalled..... should run, and move now soon.
Thanks again
Gail
