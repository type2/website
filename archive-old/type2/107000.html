Subject: Tire Data Sticker?

There's a faint impression of a sticker that was placed on the top of the
steering column bracket that attaches to the dash on G.

What's left of the sticker seems to have information about the tire size,
pressure, load limits, etc..  It's in English.  Maybe it's important?

Does anyone with `77 have one of these in their bus, and would you mind
writing down what's on it for me?  Thank you!
