&gt; Any ideas? Maybe try that Freeze rust breaker stuff?

&gt; I am so close to finishing this it's killing me, but I need to get these
&gt; damn bushings out!


get a bit of &quot;dry ice&quot;  heat the entire assembly up as hot as you can, and
then put the dry ice directly on the bushing, and whack as soon as you
can... repeat as needed, this should break the bushings free and be able
to be driven out.

I use the same basic system for putting em back in,  putting the bushings
etc in the freezer the night before. it is usually enough to make em work
a lot easier.

good luck
