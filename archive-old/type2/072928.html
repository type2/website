1970 Dormobile  (Westy with Dor package including tilt top)

Color: Savannen Biege

Body:  Straight, some surface rust, minor pitting only, minor dents in rear
lower corners and front clip.  Holes in front clip where a spare tire rack
was mounted.  All in all pretty good shape body wise.

Interior:  SO 69 westfalia werkes (similar to an SO 44), includes stove,
frig, and sink.  Cabinets are solid but suffered a minor amount of moisture
affect.  Could used as is or restored easily.  Driver seat has a rip in it,
the bench seat upholstery is in great shape.

Top:  Tilts to drivers side, canvas (vinyl red and white candy stripe) is
in great shape with only two or three pin holes.  Windows are solid and the
vents work perfectly.  all hardware is in great shape.  The two top cots
are there and in perfect condition with the original webbing still in place.

Bottom:  floors are solid except for the front floor.  Shouldn¹t be a big
welding job to fix but there are some holes to be patched.

Engine: 1600 dual port, it turns but I have not cranked it yet.  I am sure
it will and should run good according to the previous owner.  It also has a
BN4 gas heater in good condition but I have net fired it up yet either.

I am not sure what I want for the bus yet but I will consider all serious
offers.  I don¹t need it but the more I work on it the more I will grow
attached.  Also the more do on it I will want more money.  Unless of course
you are a buddy of mine and through that reationshipp I am mandated by law
to give you a good deal.

I don¹t have any pics but should in a couple weeks.  I will post where they
are and you can take a look unless it sells to someone sight unseen.

I will consider money and cash trades,  Cash only, and trades only (most
unlikely because I need some cash).

Items likely to catch my attention (along with cash of course):
Busses
Things
Beetles
Computers
Guns (long gun preferrebly but will consider a house protector)
Gold (only pure and in large quantities)
A good job with a good salary with a good company
A good lookin woman with lots of money who needs a good man. (used but not
abused)

Thanks,
Charlie Ford
