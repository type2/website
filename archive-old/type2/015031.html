Subject: BA6 Belly Pan Question
Mime-Version: 1.0

First off, I've never seen a BA-6 installation, so please excuse my
ignorance. 

In an old reply to Sami Dahklia(sp?), Karl von Salzen commented on the
belly pan that protects the BA6 from road debris and such. I was wondering:
How much of the bottom does the belly pan cover, and does it completely
isolate the BA6? There must be some air intake, but probably the area
between the frame rails and the floor of the bus would supply enough intake
air. Would I be looking at a completely flat piece of metal?

I understand from the message that the proper installation technique will
require tapping some holes in the frame rails.

TIA for the info!
