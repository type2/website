   Yes but who's to say the used one is any good or is still holding the
same curve after 30 years?

ronnie

just send your old vac dizzy to philbingroup_dot_com and have them rebuild it
and that you want the test specs on it.

&gt;&gt; Look in the archieves, somebody posted the name of a DIZZY rebuilder and
on
&gt;&gt; there web site they had most of th VW numbered dizzys, rebuilt in stocl,
&gt;&gt; from 59.95 to 129.95

&gt;also
&gt;
&gt;philbingroup_dot_com


yes, BUT. there was some discussion whther the 'one-size-fits-all' dizzys
were really all that.

plus i do recall possibly karl v. s. bringing up the point that many
'rebuilt' dizzys are NOT rebuilt to the original specs, and there is no way
to know what they actually do as to rpm/advance curve without a
dizzy-testing machine. or an attentive person with a vacuum meter and a
strobe gun :)
