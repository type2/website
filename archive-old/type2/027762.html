Anyone have any good ideas (or pictures?) for seating in a 75 bus that I 
just got?  I have the rear bench in place but it's wide open until the 
driver/passenger area.  I had been thinking about rigging some sort of 
bucket seats with back to the driver/passenger seats, but not sure if I like 
that.  Safety, convenience, cost are what I'm mostly concerned about. I'd 
love to hear what clever contraptions you all have come up with.
TIA
