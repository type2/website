Not really, unless you are running a _very_ annoying stereo.  A 50A
alternator produces 600W of power.  Raising this to 75W raises this number
to 900W.

Few stereos, even the nasty ones, pull more than 100W
continuously.  They advertise much higher power levels, but those are peak
levels (such a when reproducing a drumbeat).

Air conditioning only pulls electricity for the fans and clutch, which
don't amount to a lot of current.

An inverter may utilize the added current, but you could easily exceed the
output of either alternator.  Inverters usually run off of the battery
with the engine off, so the alternator doesn't make much difference.  A 75
amp alternator does not recharge the battery any faster than a 50A
alternator.

The 75A upright alternators are modified units and I have doubts about
whether they truly produce that current and whether they can do so without
overheating, since the cooling provisions are the same as the 50A
alternator.

I have an 80A alternator on my C*evy truck and I've never
seen the ammeter go above 20A even when the battery is discharged.
