Subject: Fw: Hi/Lo Beams + Wipers Stopped Working UPDATE

Hi

I poked around a bit, and it seems the lights work by plugging the BLACK /
YELLOW wire for the lights into a DIFFERENT fuse terminal.

I can't make the wipers budge, however.... and for some reason if I do &quot;just&quot;
the lights on the original terminal, it doesn't work either.

Maybe there's a weird connection going on inside the fuse box?  Or could it be
a relay?

Any advice much appreciated.

Best regards,
Shawn.
