Subject: RE: [T2] Gas gauge problem

You can replace the sender without cutting a hole in the deck or dropping the engine--at least I did on my dual
carb '74. That said, if I had to replace the sender tomorrow, I'd consider cutting the hole in the deck. It's a
darned tight squeeze otherwise.



&gt; if the gauge reads full it is probably the sender.
&gt; you need to pull the tank (and engine) to get to it or do the access
&gt; hatch
&gt; mod.
