Subject: side marker lens and thanks

Hi Volks,

Thanks for all the replies to my question regarding the side marker lens.
The problem with my turn signals got to where they wouldn't flash at all.
When this happened I figured out the problem, checked the flasher to see if
it was loose took it off and it was full of water.  Yes my windshield
leaks.  I just opened it, up dried it with a hair dryer, sealed it back up
with caulking and it works perfectly.

Thanks again 
Peace
Snoopy
