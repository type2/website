&gt; Third Ager [thurd-aij-er] n. 1. grown-up;  2. rule-breaker;
&gt; 3. someone in the best years of their life.  See also: Boomer.

To these definitions add:

4. unable to spell the word &quot;unsubscribe&quot;
5. unable to read and follow the instruction appended to the bottom of
every message sent by the type2 list.

Sorry to be acidic about it, but we've been getting a lot of folks sending
unsubscribe messages to the list.  You _must_ send them to the
type2-request_at_type2_dot_com account if you expect them to take effect!
