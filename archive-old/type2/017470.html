&gt; 6. Where can I get my tin powdercoated?  I'm in southern Indiana...could go
&gt; to Louisville, Cincinatti, Indy or mail them off. Where do you guys
&gt; recommend?   Man I need #5(above) in a hurry!

Check out Worco Powdercoating.  They have a web site up at
http://www.driveonline_dot_com/pisano

They are right around the corner from me in Long Beach CA, but handle mail in
parts all the time.  As far as colors, these people have an UNBELIEVABLE array
of colors.  I took a sample of the L345 light Gray that I am using to paint my
double cab and after five minutes of checking various gray samples, Carol found
as close to an exact match as humanly possible.  She has stacks of color manuals
to choose from.  They walked me around their shop floor and there was quite an
array of finished product ready to be shipped.  There was a stack of flat black
powdercoated heads and on the other side of the shop was a complete frame from a
50's vintage detroit iron.  The black gloss on that frame was so shiny, you
could comb your hair in the reflection off it. (I didn't try as there is not
much left to comb)

Be forwarned that the area code on their web site has changed.  The correct info
is:
WORCO POWDER COATING
 2109 Cherry Industrial Circle
 Long Beach, CA
562-602-0477

Hope this helps

Scott
