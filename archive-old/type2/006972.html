Hey folks,

I'm currently at the half way point of a trip I'm doing around the central 
part of the USA.  I live in Boston, and am currently in Appleton, WI.

I have a 1973 VW Camper Bus, 1700/1800cc engine. I had a good used 
transmission installed in my bus just before I left.  My VW mechanic put this 
in for  me and it worked great, except that shifting into 1st gear was really 
hard to do unless the bus came to a complete stop.   I didn't think anything 
of this until part way across the country, it got worse, and quite often 
would have to shift into 2nd gear to get it into first.

I was at an intersection at a full stop in Appleton, when I have to really 
force it into first and suddenly when it took I heard a &quot;Ka-Chunk&quot; noise from 
under the bus.  It seems the transmission is now locked into 3rd gear, and I 
can't seem to release it no matter what I do.   It reminds me of what the 
transmission in my old Ford Pickup truck was like - shifter on the steering 
wheel - when I would shift it from 3rd into 1st it would lock up, and I'd 
have to go under the hood and pull up on the linkage which would release it.  
 Is this what has happened?  I don't know if busses even have linkage).

My 2 questions are

1. Is this something I can work on myself (fairly easily) - releasing the 
linkage somehow, or will I need to have a garage do this for me?

2. If I need to go to a garage, is there a decent reputable VW Bus repair 
place anywhere nearby?

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this ASAP.   Thanks!

Chris
