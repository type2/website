Subject: Re: [T2] knobs under drivers seat

&gt; Can anyone tell me what the two knobs, mounted at
&gt; the front of the  
&gt; left/front wheelcasing are all about? One of them
&gt; turns, the other can be  
&gt; pulled. btw: It's a '72 Westfalia.

The pull-knob is for operating the flap that guides
the hot air to either the cabin or to the passenger
comapartment in the rear. The outlet of the passenger
compartment is actually on the bottom of the division
wall or (if you don't have this wall) in the floor of
the walk-thru section that connects the cabin with the
passenger compartment.

The other switch (I believe it looks pretty much like
a dashboard switch) operates the gas heater. I don't
know what it does exactly. I believe it is connected
with a push-pull cable as well to a flap that is in
the pipe that runs next to the gas tank (pipe lies in
between gas heater and rear of passenger compartment)



yours,


Vincent
