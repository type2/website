&gt;The &quot;grub screw&quot; should have a hole through it for a wire.  Run the wire
&gt;around the whole unit (through the screw) and it won't back out anymore.

Well maybe not if it has been serviced replaced...

FWIW the late manual claims the grub screw with safety wire was
deleted in late '76 (TSB to the effect) and that they went to a hex
head with built in sealing compound (blue loctite sort of compound
like they use on front caliper bolts for FWD VW's.)  My point here
being you can always use some Loctite (I'd use red) on the thing
as well, if everything is clean. Probably must be loosening to wear
things IMHO.  My '76 definitely still used square head with safety
wire screws.  I never looked under the '77 or '78 to see if the later
ones actually exist or not.  If they did, might have been service installed
into a '72.  Definitely needs to be a 90 degree pointed set screw
regardless.
