Subject: '78 Bus FI troubleshooting - only runs on cold-start after engine swap

Hi All,

At first, I was going to install my new AVP engine myself. I went as far as removing the old =
engine, etc. To keep this story short I will spare all the frustrating details of this decision,  =
but I decided to have Lou (my old friend/trusted VW mechanic) finish the swap.

My wiring is a little complicated in that I have an MSD ignition and a Compufire points =
replacement, so I told him that I would finish doing the wiring.=20

Anyway, it is all back together, and something isn't wired right or got burned out. The bus will =
run on the coldstart valve, but not on the injectors. Lou says that the injectors are getting the =
pulse signal but not the other connection, the solid signal (I forget if it is a constant ground =
or constant positive) is missing.

I tried following the Bentley book in testing the double relay. The relay seems to have positive =
in the right place when the key is off. With the key on, it does not seem to energize 88b as it is =
supposed to. Also, we are supposed to check for presence of ground on 85, but what seems to be =
labeled 85 doesn't seem to have a pin long enough to check (or I am checking it and it isn't =
showing ground). This was all working with the old engine, so I don't think the relay is bad. Also =
we tried another relay that Lou says is &quot;known good&quot; and it didn't work either.

I'm thinking that maybe wherever the signal goes into the relay to switch-on 88b is where the =
fault is, but I don't understand from the wiring diagram where I should be checking. The switched =
positive from the keyswitch up front must run back somewhere, through someting and eventually to =
an unknown pin on the double relay. I think I should be working backwards from the where this =
signal comes into the relay, but I don't see where to check.

Any guesses what we didn't hook up right? Any suggestions on any of this in general?

Thanks much!

Mark

I promise a full report on the engine swap/AVP situation when all is done.
