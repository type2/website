Subject: dormobile in canada

Bonjour,

My name is Luc Perron and I live in Chicoutimi, Quebec.  My wife and I own 
a vw dormobile 1971 for 3 years now.  This van has had a lot of owner 
before us and now a lot af things are missing in it.  I need to be in 
contact with somebody who can describe me the dormobile equipement and 
arrangement so I can fix my van as close as the original as possible.  The 
infos I need are:

Curtains arrangement
Shelves description (no one in the van)
Stove instructions and description (we have an incomplete one behind 
passenger seat)
Fridge( we have no)
Table description (we have no)
Bed/bench seat (Think mine is westfalia)
Location of the spare tire
Water available (we have no)
accessories.

If needed, i will produce a complete description af our van and 
equipements.  See a picture here:
