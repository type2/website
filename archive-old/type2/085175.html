Subject: Re: [T2] BustedBus buying experience

I also would like to throw out a plug for bustedbus_dot_com. I call Joe looking for a heater part and even though he didn't have it he has helped me locate what I need, and basically went an extra 10 miles for me even though I have never even bought anything from him (yet, I will for sure go to him first for anything else in the future) and wasn't even buying the heater part I was looking for from him. He was just helping out cause he's a nice guy and knows that a little kindness can go a long way. If anyone wants to deal with a company that is willing to go the extra mile I would say bustedbus is it.  Just thought I would share a good experience also.
