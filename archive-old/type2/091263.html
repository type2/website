&gt; &gt; List,
&gt; &gt; I need to know if the torque converter from a bus
&gt; &gt; manufactured in august of 1975 will work for Karl
&gt; &gt;, who recently posted that he needed one
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; a 1982 vanagon.
&gt; &gt; I originally thought this was from a 76 bus, but i
&gt; &gt; remembered the sticker saying 8/75...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can't find a part number on it anywhere.
&gt; &gt; I don't want to sell him something that won't
&gt; work.
