A previous owner has installed some cheapo aftermarket exhaust on my '76
Bus, and I had been looking into my options for replacement.  An OEM system
may be nice, but I haven't been able to find a crossover pipe for a '76.
All the other pieces seem to be available.

Has anyone used the GT Sport system?  If so, how is the performance, sound,
fit, and durability?  In the archives, someone mentioned that the paint
burns off almost immediately so I'm prepared to strip it and paint it with
a high temperature paint.
