Subject: Re: [T2] re: Westy extinguisher size?

I don't have a Westfalia, but to me, the size of the fire 
extinguisher is of primary importance and where it fits is a 
distant second.  If you want to have any chance of putting out a 
real fire you need a large extinguisher, usually sold as an 
industrial model, about 5&quot; in diameter.  I can't remember the 
capacity offhand.  I have one of these in a cabinet, plus one of 
the smaller Kidde ones behind the front seat and a third (tiny) 
one in the narrow bin under the front passenger seat.  I am going 
to remount the large one to the heater tube in the front of the 
bus, where it will be more easily accessible.

&gt;If you have a fire extinguisher in your 74-79
&gt;westfalia camper, what is the make and model and where
&gt;to you stow it?
