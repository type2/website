Subject: Re: [T2] Popping on overrun

Are you carburated like most/all of the UK spec Type II's??? If yes, you 
should richen your mixture a bit. Mixture is very close to optimum if you 
get just an occasional pop when decelerating. Too much popping, too lean. 
No popping at all and you are likely richer than you need to be. Best to 
verify first no vacuum leaks. Check to make sure the manifold and carb 
mounting nuts are tight, then have the mixture set with an exhaust gas 
readout, but the Bentley carb adjustment procedure works well IF the motor 
has good spec compression balance and the carbs are clean with unworn 
throttle shafts. If the motor and/or carbs are worn, you will have to set 
them somewhat rich to get good idle and running and just replace your spark 
plugs a bit more often.
