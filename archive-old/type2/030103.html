It would be better to figure out why it won't pass smog and fix that.  No
sense killing a bus to satisfy the smog twits.

&gt; Hi:  
&gt; 
&gt; I got your e-mail from a VW mechanic/hobbyist in Encinitas, Calif.  He 
&gt; suggested I write.
&gt; I'm looking for help in selling my 76 bus.  The engine has been rebuilt and 
&gt; has less than 200 miles on it, the tranny was rebuilt about 15,000 miles 
&gt; back, BUT after 3 attempts I can't get it smogged and I'm tired of fooling 
&gt; with it.   I've decided it may just be best to part it out.
