Subject: Underfunding and low moral at NPS

This is not a partisan issue. Underfunding of the National Park Service 
has been bad under both parties. So there's no reason for anyone to get 
testy about the politics of this message.

The Los Angeles Times has a very good piece about underfunding and low 
morale at the National Park Services, where statistically the chances 
of being killed in the line of duty are higher than in our military. A 
ranger was recently killed at Organ Pipe National Monument, my favorite 
place to go and camp in Peregrine. At least, it was. You can read the 
story at:

http://www.latimes_dot_com/features/outdoors/la-os-newfamily6apr06.story

Why this is not a national scandal, with daily stories on the front 
pages of our newspapers, is beyond me. But I know this: the National 
Parks and Monuments are the main reason I have a bus at all. They go 
hand in hand.

I strongly urge every American citizen on this list to write to his or 
her legislators, urging them to do something about the situation. For 
those on the list who are not Americans, but who have visited our parks 
or plan to at some time in the future, I urge that you write to the 
American embassy in your country.

I would like to do more.

Here are two ideas: The first is that every bus owner who enters a 
National Park this year take a care package for rangers and staff. I 
don't know what should be in it. Maybe you have ideas? These people 
need our support.

The other is that bus owners organize rallies for the parks -- very 
visible showings of support.

Any other ideas?
