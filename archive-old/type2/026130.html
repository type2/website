Isaiah,

Sounds like the pin in the ball at the base of the stick may have come out /
sheared off.  To check, undo the 2 bolts at the floor and pull the whole
thing out.  Poking out of the front of the ball should be a pin about 1/8&quot;
diameter (you may have to scrape some grease off to see).  If this pin isn't
there, the whole stick will be able to swivel round.  If it's not fixable,
you should be able to get a stick from a junkyard.

&gt; could get into the back.  When I shifted it the shifter moved wayyyyy
&gt; over to the right and swiveled around so that what should be 
&gt; facing the
&gt; back of the bus....faces the front of the bus.....when I try
