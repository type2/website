Subject: Re: [T2] '78 Westy Electrical - wipers/rear window defroster

Chris,

From memory(I'm at work right now)...   3 relay's

Troy Wicals should have several rear of fuse box shots i did for him that 
show all colors and placement.

I have 78 champagne with defroster(not working) :-((

Intermittent wipers...etc

Chris, intermittent wipers all use the same idea...count off seconds based 
on some control setting and then send one shot of juice the the wiper to 
get it started....wait x seconds and do it again.

Lots of other folks sell these also, including kit versions that you put 
together yourself...

Cheers ,dave

&gt; We're working towards being road worthy soon. Presently I am doing 
&gt; electrical things. I've completed the headlight relays and a few days ago 
&gt; removed all the VW stuff I was storing in the bus so I could work inside.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a while since I took it apart and I need some guidance.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone take a look at their '78 Westy and count the number of relay 
&gt; boxes they have on the bottom of their fuse block?
&gt; 
&gt; I have space for one or two more relays. There is wiring there for at least 
&gt; one relay. I have not investigated what the color codes on the wires this 
&gt; week b/c I have not had the time. I know I can find the answer in Bentley 
&gt; but can anyone set me straight from memory?
&gt; 
&gt; I have two options on my bus I have not checked for operation yet. One is 
&gt; the rear window defroster. The other is that my bus is a Champagne Edition 
&gt; and it has factory intermittent wipers. Does this option use a relay on the 
&gt; fuse block? Is it the same relay as the blinker relay? Electrically it 
&gt; would work - the relay is a closed switch with opens once the load heats 
&gt; the contacts. The wipers would be the load and once the contacts open, the 
&gt; wipers would make one sweep and then park just like the driver had turned 
&gt; the wipers on and then off immediately in a basic bus without intermittent 
&gt; wipers.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone investigated adapting the Golf or Jetta or Passat &quot;programmable&quot; 
&gt; delay relay to the VW bus? I know it was discussed by one of the VW lists 
&gt; at one time. Basically you install this relay and based on a process 
&gt; involving how you turn the wipers on and off, you can set the delay.
&gt; 
&gt; I know JC Whipme has generic delay kits but I am interested in the VW version.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to any and all that can help.
