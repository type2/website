&gt; Last summer on a 140,000 mile 2L engine, I pulled a 1300 lb Scamp trailer
&gt; with my [Jamie Rivers Hitch] on my westy loaded with camping gear and 4 adults through your Cal desert.
&gt; I went from lower Arizona to LA then back to Kansas, over mountain passes
&gt; and all with no overheating problem.  I have put an additional 25,000 on
&gt; that engine pulling my trailer with my [Jamie Rivers Hitch]
&gt; with no problems.  Of course the engine is in
&gt; good tune, I run the 50w racing oil and Lucas.  I also drive the bus as it
&gt; was meant to be driven.

Oh by the way,, you can see JAMIE RIVERS HITCH  at

This is a good quote:
&gt; Jake Raby said it very well the other day, HIGH RPM's heat up the oil, LOW
&gt; RPM's heat up the heads.  Therefore, keeping the RPM's around 3800 will keep
&gt; your engine as cool as possible.
