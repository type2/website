Subject: side marker lights

&gt; Just wondering I have a 73 kombi with only 1 (driver side rear ) red
&gt; lighted side marker lens.  The other three are  yellow and
reflective only.
Seems to me if the one rear light has been rplaced by a reflector then
the ground for that connector is no longer there or grounded. If you can
find the ground wire for the missing side light try grounding it, then
check
the ops on your turn signals. That missing ground may be the cause of
your spasoid turn signal. This may not have mattered untill you got the
other side light working as both side lights were not in use. Now you
have
an unequal draw of current from one side. Just a thought.
