Subject: Pertronix 

All,

I loved my Pertronix, until it crapped out on me the other day.  Cruising
along and heard a loud pop and the engine died.  Coasted to a parking lot
and surveyed the scene.  Belt was fine, everything else looked fine,
dipstick warm (not hot).  

Two things popped into mind: the coil, and the Pertronix.  Tested the coil
and the spark looked ok.  Then took out my spare condensor and points and
replaced the Pertronix and drove home.

I plan on getting another through warranty but wanted to remind all with to
be sure the have a backup just in case.
