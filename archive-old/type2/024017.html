Subject: heat exchanger differences
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hey now busmates,
My bus is a 72, recently I purchased a doner bus also a 72.  When I dropped
the motor out of the doner I noticed the heat exchangers from the doner bus
are much smaller than the stock heat exchangers that came on my bus.  Can
anyone shed some light on why there is such a difference.  The smaller set
defintely will fit on my bus but why is the body of the exchanger so much
smaller on this set?

TIA
