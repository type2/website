Subject: Re: [T2] chopped bus, no title, HELP ME!!!


Well, Matty, i used to have a couch that i did not want. so, i used a 
chainsaw and threw away a chunk each week with regular garbage delivery. it 
took several months, your bus could take a year, but why not practice your 
cutting and grinding techniques?
  in all seriousness, you could post the usable panels on the internet for 
sale, and people with bus damage could be responsible for buying the pieces 
and cutting them off...

&gt;fellow airheads,
&gt;
&gt;  heres the situation, i have a 71 westy, which i
&gt;purchased for 60 bucks. it was so far gone that i
&gt;simply chopped it. i actually sold many of the parts
&gt;to listees. however now i need the garage space for my
&gt;76 westy. i have no title for the vehicle, the lady
&gt;said she would find it and contact me (yeah, like that
&gt;even happened!) at any rate, i just want this bus
&gt;gone, out of my life!!! i will give it to anyone who
&gt;wants it, i would even pay someone to get it the h#ll
&gt;away! short of that however, i am seeking advice as to
&gt;what the most painless rought would be to disposing of
&gt;this no longer fun or useful bus. thanks in adavance
&gt;as always!!
