&gt; to me with an aftermarket carb and manifold. I was going to re-install the

&gt; convert the stock Fuel Injection[FI] to a Bosch CIS system from an early VW
&gt; Rabbit[K-Jetronic for you termophiles][...]
&gt;   Has anyone tried this? If not would anyone be interested in seeing this
&gt; documented?

Pat,

Check out my pages
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/cisfi.html
http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/typeIV.html

And check out Gary Miller's (the net's CIS guru) site
http://www_dot_millerfi_dot_com

I have a 2.0L converted to an upright and installed in my '60 doublecab.  I used
a CIS system from a '78 volvo 2.1L because displacement wise it is sized closer
to the 2.0L than the 1.7L rabbit.  I have about 1000 miles on the engine at this
point.  I should be updating the pages in the next few weeks with final info.

It works great and I'm having a great time with the power and dependablilty of
the system.

Happy New Year,

Scott
