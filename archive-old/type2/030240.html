&gt; The problem was in fact the 30 amp generator/ B*G backing plate.
&gt; The engine comes out today for the fix.

So this means that the 30A generator backing plate is different from an
alternator backing plate, right?  I suspected as much, as the &quot;conversion
kits&quot; always include backing plates.  Let us know how the washers and
shims work out for fan clearance.

Interesting to note that the alternator is considerably lighter than the
generator it replaced, and that if you peer into the front of the
alternator case you'll see that it is mostly empty space!
