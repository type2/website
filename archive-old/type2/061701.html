Subject: MSHP -Stage II

Hello Steven:

Don't really know about the MSHP stuff....but I kinda know fuel
injection.  The extra liters of the engine will just suck in more
air/fuel.  The FI simply meters the fuel based on the amount of air
being delivered to the engine.  Therefore, if the idle mixture and speed
are properly set the stock FI system should work.  You really need an O2
sensor to determine this.  You might wanna build/install an EGO sensor
meter.  I found a diagram at the address below.  Looks like around $10
worth of parts and a couple of hours work.  With the gauge, idle setup
should be no problem.  Or you could use a voltmeter to get the mixture.
One problem might be that the stock FI cannot deliver enough fuel _at_
higher RPM's, but Bosch made several different injectors, and 2 with
higher fuel delivery(see link below).  This is where the EGO meter would
come in handy.  Also, with a simple rheostat on the o2 feedback circuit
you could, in effect lie, to the ECU to get a richer, more powerful mix,
and make it dash mountable like the multi-buck systems on the
aftermarket now.

Please keep us informed on this project.  Many of us are intersted in
this engine.  Good luck.
