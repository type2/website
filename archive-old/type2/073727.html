Dear Grant.

If my copy of VW Camper &amp; Commercial magazine, Issue No. 4, is too be 
believed, Just Kampers in Geat Britain, are currently selling this type of 
window.

Regards.

&gt;Subject: [T2] Riviera sliding window
&gt;Date: Sat, 13 Oct 2001 10:17:51 -0700
&gt;
&gt;My 72 Rivi is missing the passenger side sliding window.  I went to the
&gt;glass shop and they told me it's NLA und would have to be reproduced in
&gt;plastic unless I could track down the manufacturer.
&gt;
&gt;So, first, does anyone happen to have one, or even the little clasp?  And
&gt;second, does anyone know who manufactured the window frames?  I've examined
&gt;mine and find no maker's mark.  Maybe I'll have to scrounge a set of
&gt;jalousies. :(
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Grant
