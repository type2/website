Mike, you wrote:

&gt; Even the upright I'm building now will have the t3 lower &quot;cooling tin&quot; on it. 

I have some of those, i wanted to use them on my 1600, but i found
that the 3pcs. of bottom tin pieces will not fit properly anymore, 
aside from having proper cooling air exhaust or not, i'd like to 
have them on to protect the pushrod tubes, the ones i have are 
genuine VW, i also have a set similar to the T3 tins, in fact they 
could also be called T3 tins as they come of off a T3 Transporter 
1600, engine code CT, used in Transporters, Vanagons if you like, 
built from 5-'79 to 12-'82 (approx.). These are also pancake motors, 
the fanschroud looks very similar to that of a T4 engine but is made 
out of steel sheet metal, the oil cooler the same as T3 and is 
mounted the same as in a T3 except more towards the rear of the 
engine and mounted on a spacer so the cooler sits about 80mm above 
the crankcase. (This motor also has a cast on oil filter mount and 
hydraulic lifters)

Anyway, the Part# of the tins of the CT engine starts with 171, i
don't recall the rest of the number, they are made to fit the 8mm
headstuds and the T3 tins i have are for 10mm studs, i dono if VW
ever made T3 tins for 8mm studs, if they did they must be pretty 
rare as they started the 8mm headstuds somewhere '73, i haven't
seen '73 T1 engines with 8mm studs and the T3's production stopped 
in '73.

The Transporter tins also do not have the two approx. 4x4cm pieces
of tin that sort of sit tight against front and rear of the head, 
for the rest they are the same.

Brian.
