Subject: cleaning brake fluid reservoir

Hi,

In an earlier post I had mentioned that I found a thick, black &quot;icky&quot;
deposit in the brake fluid twin-reservoir above the master-cylinder. I also
found crud in the refill reservoir under the driver's seat. You can tell
there's dirt in there since the plastic is translucid. I tried cleaning them
out by flushing them with brake fluid but the result was not conclusive;
what was really needed was a wipe with a towel, unfortunately you can't get
a towel in there.

Solution: little copper balls for BB guns. Put a bunch in there with some
brake cleaner, plug the outlets with two thumbs and a finger (I wear latex
gloves when dealing with harsh liquids) and shake that baby!  Et voila!

Sami
