&gt;my 1972 westy is getting the 1700cc carbed engine replaced with a 
&gt;2Ltr with stock fuel injection.  It's at the Tech Shop in Seattle

You probably already know this, but you'll need a gas tank from a fuel injected 
bus.  The carbed buses only have a fuel outlet tube on the bottom of the tank 
while the FI buses have an outlet tube and a return tube.
