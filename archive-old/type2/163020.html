Subject: Re: [T2] &quot;Bad exhaust gasket&quot;-like sound at start-up

Nick,

It is probably nothing that dropping your engine cannot solve.... :-)

Maybe heads are loose. I know you torqued them, but maybe they moved
and are now loose. After a head install the good mechanics usually
torque them after 1000-3000 miles anyway. So you have an engine pull
ahead anyway. You'll get the chance to check all that.

Forgot an exhaust gasket? (ask me how I know) Maybe a bad one.  Broke
an exhaust stud ? Forgot that &quot;metal wool&quot; gasket between the
resonator and the heat exchangers ?

Put a foot on the tailpipe. Does the pressure build ? If yes, your
exhaust is tight. If not look for leaks.
