&gt;This has got me wondering what the thought is about swapping left for right 
&gt;when re-installing freshly greased, healthy joints. Is this thought to 
&gt;extend joint life?? or does this create other problems??

This can easily double the life of a joint.  I don't rec doing it with galled
dead crap but if you swap the CV's (or entire half shaft) side to side
when you do a clean and repack it will wear the thrust surfaces on
the opposite sides of the races.  This should be SOP for any repack
every 40-50k miles really.  This is a great swap because not only does
it wear the opposite side, it wears it in a perpendicular path so only
1 spot is actually full &quot;looseness&quot; of the combinded wear.

BTW obviously can't swap auto tranny half shafts, you got to pull and
swap the joints for that folks.
