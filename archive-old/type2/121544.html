Subject: Re: [T2] rotary conversion

&gt;Buses need lots of low-end torque to get the beasts moving and to keep them
&gt;moving against lots of wind resistance.  And while those rotary engines
&gt;don't mind high RPM (I think the 914 conversion saw nearly 8000 RPM fairly
&gt;regularly) they're not designed to run under heavy loads at high RPM for
&gt;extended periods of time.  Personally I think that conversion in a bus would
&gt;be a bad idea.

And... according to two friends who owned about 4 RX-7s between them, the 
engines are real gas hogs.... Below 20 in little sports cars.
