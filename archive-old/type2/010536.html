Thanks for the good response, BOTH Daves' ! ! !

Dave at Blakes does not have what I am looking for, but he offered that he 
does have e-mail ( dave_at_junkyarddave_dot_com ) and a web page  
www.junkyarddave_dot_com

Dave _at_ Blakes said he will look out for my Sage Green Doors for my '78 
Westy, and suggested that e-mail, along with the 800 number, would be the 
best way to communiacte.

The web page is expecting an update by the end of this week, so look back..
