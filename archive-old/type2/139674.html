Subject: Re: [T2] Snap-on is crazy

Mark,

You are trutely jinxed on this one!

How about if you take a 1/4&quot; rod, cut it about 3&quot; long, make the ends 
square  and measure it on your caliper.

Then take that same piece and measure it on everything else you 
have...same length?  If you aren't happy with that, then use something 
&quot;known&quot; like the round part of an 8mm bolt.

Then take it to your $228 &quot;free&quot; micrometer and measure it on it!!!

Somewhere along the line you have spent way more time and energy on making 
the measurement than it was worth!&lt;big grin&gt;

I'm willing to wager a 6 pack of the finest German beer that your $19.95 
caliper is gonna be within 3 thousandths over three inches compared to the 
other &quot;serious&quot; measuring devices.....but if you win, you have to come to 
Arkansas to pick it up!

buscontent....I, of course measure everything that goes on my bus...yeah, 
right&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

&gt; I ordered a standard from another on-line source and received a 
&gt; Starrett standard a few days ago. I haven't yet returned the grease 
&gt; because Snap-on sent me a misaddressed label for doing the return.
&gt; 
&gt; And now the latest: today, UPS dropped off a 3&quot; Snap-on micrometer 
&gt; ($228). No purchase order, no shipping label. No sign that my credit 
&gt; card has been dunned.
&gt; 
&gt; I spent a minute or two trying to convince myself that this was a 
&gt; goodwill gesture. But, no, it's a screw-up. Much as I would like to 
&gt; keep the micrometer, I'm not a $228 micrometer kind of mechanic. So
