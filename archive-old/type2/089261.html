Subject: Re: [T2]  New Microbus ( S A V W )

&gt; I beg to differ. The Volkswagen Transporter has been an ongoing product
for
&gt; over 40 years, despite its different incarnations. Here in the U.S. we
tend
&gt; to differentiate between the &quot;bus&quot; and later forms of the Transporter like
&gt; the Vanagon and EuroVan.  But that is only because they were marketed that
&gt; way to us.  We got different names, like Microbus, Station Wagon, Vanagon,
&gt; EuroVan, for each successive incarnation of the Transporter.  Not so the
&gt; rest of the world.  There, every VW van from the 60's on to this day has
&gt; been a Volkswagen Transporter.

Not so. In Brasil and Mexico they refer to the Bay Window as the Kombi. In
Argentine the Transporter is a Rabbit like pickup with a hard shell on the
back, in South Africa there are several &quot;Buses&quot;, the T4Caravelle which is
like our EuroVan, the Bus which is a Vanagon, in Austrailia they do indeed
call the Eurovan the Transporter,

&gt; And in many cases, the changes throughout the years were evolutionary, not
revolutionary - from the the T2 transporter (our &quot;bus&quot;) to the T25 (our
&quot;Vanagon&quot;) to the T4 (our &quot;EuroVan&quot;), to the T5 (&quot;our New Microbus&quot;).
So when did it lose its bus heritage? Or, for that matter, did it?  The body
style change from Bus to Vanagon was not that much more dramatic than the
change from splitty to breadloaf, and the Vanagon remained aircooled and
rear engined, so it would be hard to say that the &quot;heritage&quot; was lost in
1980 when the Transporter's second body style change occurred.  And adding a
&gt; water jacket to a Beetle engine&lt;

That was not a Beetle engine but a jointly developed Engine by Porsche and
VW called the Type 4 Engine, When the water jacket was put on it became the
WASSERBOXER.


&gt; &gt; Bus owners have always been viewed as Hippies and
&gt; &gt; losers, now is a good chance to show we are normal
&gt; &gt;  everyday people who just love the old buses.

Sorry all you Hippies and losers :)
