Was writ:
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My kids when they were young loved the bus, but now that they're teen 
agers
they wouldn't be seen dead in it.

Enjoy your kids while you can, but remember &quot;they turn into teenagers
eventually&quot;!&lt;&lt;&lt;

I have the teenage thing going on now with the oldest. Take them to the VW 
shows and campouts. Then their ride is cool again.

When Young Ted was very small and I was to make a trip to a VW camp, I asked 
who wanted to go. The bigger kids were scheduled for other things, but she 
said &quot;I'll go daddy&quot;. Never thought about taking her at that young age but 
she was out of diapers. She is seven now and has only missed one or two trips 
since!

Just got back from Chucky's Redneck Camp #003. Got there about 4:30 saturday 
so missed the bike rally. The chili cookoff seemed a success. The food and 
fellowship was great. The beer belly contest did not happen as the 
contestants were, ... well..... (they forgot about it). It rained most of the 
time but between the showers we had fun. Marv, you took off too early. Missed 
my wonderful breakfast!

I took Ted and my 84 year old dad. What a wonderful thing it is that they get 
to spend this kind of time with each other. Dad had a great time. Thanks to 
those who spent some time with him. We took all back roads except 10 miles on 
interstate. Even did some &quot;long cuts&quot; through Greene County. It is a very 
beautiful area. The 69, running again after the ignition prob, ran like a 
champ. 25.6 MPG and was hot but too too hot. :-)
