Subject: High temp. paints

Has anyone tried any of the high temp paints from POR15 on exhaust
components?  I just received a used exhaust from Joe at BUStedBUS_dot_com and I
am thinking of hitting it with a coat of the &quot;Factory Manifold Grey&quot; or the
&quot;POR 20&quot; before installation.  Both are listed as withstanding temps up to
1400F.  I have tried other methods such as grill/stove paint in the past to
prevent surface rust, and have never been very happy with the results.
Please let me know if you have any first hand experience, be it good or bad.
