Subject: where to start turn signal trouble shoot

My new westy has an odd electrical issue and I was 
hoping one of you out there had run into it before so I 
wouldn't have to trouble shoot the whole system (and 
start from the wrong end!)
Here are the conditions:
- Left turn signals work well.
- Right turn signals work but noticably dim.
- Left front turn signal lights with application of 
brakes.
- Brake lights work fine.

Should I start with the grounds in the light housings or 
the switch assembly on the column?
thanks for any hints.
