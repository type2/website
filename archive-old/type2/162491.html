&gt; Well, Bob, I am home, in Springfield VA, having been towed 89.6 miles/  I
&gt; was stuck on Sunday afternoon, while coming from EZ Pickins .  I tried
&gt; calling you but I must have an old number.  Dolan was home, and he walked me
&gt; through a bunch of diagnostics.

????? hmm was here Sunday afternoon....  maybe you tried my cell, I
usually leave it off unless expecting a call.   main number answered 24/7
(human or machine) is 410-327-6119

  sorry I wasn't here when you needed me...


&gt; But I think I found the source of the problem.  Long story cut short is:
&gt; the little double ground wire at the double relay came loose and undone!!
&gt; The one that fits between the double relay and the resistor pack.  Hope,
&gt; hope, hope . . .

that'll do it, hope it is that simple....

glad you got home ok

Bob
