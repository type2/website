&gt;Just throwing my (type) 2 cents into the 'who wants my fridge' thread...
&gt;
&gt;I recently acquired a fridge/sink assembly from a '71 Westy and was also
&gt;wondering if the fridge worked or if it just took a long time to cool.
&gt;It's not a Dometic, I can't remember who makes it.

If it's not Dometic, it's probably Norcold.

&gt;Anyway, it looks
&gt;like you could take any small fridge (i.e. Dorm/apartment fridge) and
&gt;wedge it in the cabinet, cut off the plug, and hook it up to the AC/DC
&gt;inverter inside the cabinet.

You have an inverter inside the cabinet?  That didn't come with the camper.
The Norcold fridge uses a small (40 watt, I believe) inverter to run an
essentially normal 110V A/C refrigerator.  If you wanted to make something
like this yourself, you would have to worry about two things.  First of
all, the compressors in refrigerators are very sensitive to the kind of
electricity they receive.  I don't know the exact details, but most
inverters you find in the stores say they will not work with refrigerators.
I think they need to be close to a true sine wave output as oppposed to
the square wave or &quot;stepped&quot; sine wave most cheaper inverters produce.
Second, if you do find one that will work, it will need to be of great
enough wattage to drive the refrigerator.  I'm not sure, but I think those
little dorm fridges are not as efficient as the Norcold and probably draw
more like 100-200 watts.  After all this, it's likely that the
inverter/fridge will draw too much current to be practical on 12 volts.  If
you have a sine wave inverter in your refrigerator cabinet, I'm jealous...
