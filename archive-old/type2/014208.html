Subject: Re: [T2] Front Axle/Engine Seal Bonanza

the drag link can be a bear.
Ive broken tie rod end removal pullers before. If you buy a puller get a
good one from someplace you can return the broken one back to.
Ive had better success with a pickle fork and BFH combined with heat and
liquid wrenching spray.
OTOH you might get lucky and it could be only pretty darn stuck as oposed
to really freaking stuck.
Ive actually given up on one before when the fork, pbblaster, propane
torch and broken puller all failed. I let a good steering box go to the
crusher.
good luck.
