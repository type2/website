&gt;One thing that confuses
&gt;me though, is that adjusting the Idle Mixture Screw (on top), and the Idle
&gt;Speed Adjusting Screw make absolutely no difference.

That tells me that your idle shutoff solenoid (the larger one at the front of the left carb) is not opening properly.  Unscrew it a few turns or remove it and plug the hole temporarily, and see if the problem persists.

If you later find that the idle speed adjusting screw works but the idle mixture screw still has little or no effect, you may not have your throttle stops on the carbs set properly.  This is very important to the desired operation of the central idling system.
