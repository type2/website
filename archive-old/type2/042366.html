Subject: How Peregrine Got Her Name

Way back in the summer of 1970, I was washing pots from 6 am to 3 pm at a 
hospital in Akron, Ohio, and acting every night at the Weathervane 
Theater in a production of &quot;Dark of the Moon,&quot; an awful play that ran six 
weeks, only Monday nights dark. Early that summer I fell in love with a 
flutist who, after our first date, went to Cincinnati for the summer to 
study at the College Conservatory of Music. I couldn't visit her for six 
weeks, and she couldn't visit me. 

So we wrote, every day. This was before e-mail. Her letters were filled 
with stories about the people she had met. One of them was a woman with a 
free spirit, who was either named Peregrine or called herself Peregrine.

One letter told of how Peregrine had painted an enormous sun on the main 
sidewalk between the conservatory and the student union.

By the time &quot;Dark of the Moon&quot; closed, and I finally took off for a week
in Cincinnati, Peregrine was gone. The rain had washed the sun off the
sidewalk. My girlfriend was a little annoyed at my obvious interest in
this individual. 

So, twenty-eight years later, when I needed a name for my bus, one name 
that popped into my mind was Peregrine. I looked it up -- it meant 
wanderer. Dang.
