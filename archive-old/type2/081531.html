Subject: [T2] RE: Question replacing injector seals....

&gt;I never took them off before as I considered them &quot;permanent&quot;...
&gt;So, I don't know what they look like under there...whether you could use a
&gt;hose clamp and short new line or not.
&gt;I bought rebuilt injectors for my 78 for $38 each...they want the cores,
&gt;but won't care if the short pieces are on ther or not as they get replaced
&gt;during rebuild.

The injectors have crimped clamps which can be carefully removed
by cutting the crimped section at an angle ( metal blade or grinder )
and twisting the last bit with needle nose pliers. There is a &quot;barb&quot;
in the plastic injector under the hose which must not be damaged.
If the injector displays correct pattern, keep it.
2 fuel injection hose clamps work fine.
