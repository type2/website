Subject: [T2] Oil Cooler Questions

Hi all, mrbill back on the list. I just got my 71 hardtop camper back from paint, she is beautiful wearing the original colors once again. I have looked in the archives and  talked with local VW folks about what can be done to lower the oil temps on my stock 1600dp. In tune and timed correctly, it runs up into 250-260 routinely in the summer. I will be headed down to Baja in June and don't want to challenge the Green Angels with a breakdown.
The word I'm getting is to run a thermostat controlled/electric fan type external cooler underneath the bus positioned out of harms way. The opinions differ on a deep sump and full-flowing the case. The only thread in the archives that sheds a positive light was from Surfer Bob who seemed satisfied with his setup. 
It is real important to me to get a handle on this soon so that I can move on to carburation (another post).
Thanks, mrbill
