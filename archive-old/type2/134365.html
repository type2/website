Subject: Re: [T2] Stripped Intake bolts...

&gt; Before I make it worse, can someone make a suggestion as to what I should do at this point? I figure my next
step is to install a helicoil in the holes.

Time-Sert is a much better product.

&gt; Does the Bus Depot sell ones?

Any good automotive store sells Heli-coil products. Time-Sert are a little tougher to find.

And the phrase 'good automotve store' does NOT mean Auto-Zone, Checkers, Smucks, Pep Boys, GrandAuto, or any
of the other oil and filter stores....... [I know I missed at least one]

&gt; Should I go with one that will allow me to use the factory bolts?

YES!!!! You should not have even asked that........    8 x 1.25mm
