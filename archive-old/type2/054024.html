Subject: Re: VW Insulation!

Darrin,
   I wouldn't put NASA insulation on the engine compartment for the reason
you stated. NASA insulation is a better thermal insulator than noise
blocker/absorber. I think what you are really after is to reduce the engine
noise heard in the cabin. To do this you should need to use vibration
damping material to kill the structurally transmitted engine noise from
making it into the cabin. Q-pads are one product that will help, and there
are other products on the market (how much money do you want to spend?). You
may want to check out the EAR website at http://www.earsc_dot_com or
http://www.noisekiller_dot_com or http://www.soundcoat_dot_com. EAR has a damping
composite that combines a noise absorbing foam with a vibration damping
layer of either aluminum or vinyl. Noisekiller has a Q-pad alternate, and a
vibration deadening paint (like undercoat). Most of these products are not
cheap.
