Hi,
I am writing to you asking for help. My husband owns a VW repair shop. He is
looking for a special tool for the older VW Bug, Ghias, and Buses. The tool
he is looking  is a swing axle wheel bearing puller. It pulls the bearings
out of the axle. A friend of ours purchased one about 20 years ago from a
German parts company and he is not ready to get rid of it. I was wondering
and hoping maybe you know where we could locate a special tool like that.
