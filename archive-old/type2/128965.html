&gt;Hi all,
&gt;A few years ago (about 10-15k miles) I replaced my front shift rod bushing.
&gt;When I was under the bus today I noticed that there was a *lot* of side to
&gt;side play in it, as in the whole bush moves but is tight on the rod.
&gt;Probably 1/8&quot; altogether.  Do they often wear out this quick, or could
&gt;something else be amiss?  The bush is just located in a hole in a bracket
&gt;that is welded together and it looks fine to me.

Mine didn't last two years. The reproduction bushing is cheaply made in my opinion. I put on na OEM one and I will be taking note of the mileage and condition in two years.
