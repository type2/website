Subject: Re: Dumb Heat Question

&gt;What if a person installed an external oil cooler on the inside of the bus?
&gt;Would it provide any significant heat once it warmed up? Like a
&gt;radiator-type heater through which steam was piped.
&gt;
&gt;I know that external oil coolers are typically used to reduce the temp of
&gt;the oil, so their primary use is in the summer time. BUT...if you don't live
&gt;where you need an external cooler, I don't see why you couldn't install a
&gt;shutoff valve for summer use (to keep from rising the interior temp) and use
&gt;the heater/cooler only in the winter. It would provide no help until the bus
&gt;warmed up, but personally, I can wear a jacket for the first 10-20 minutes.
&gt;
&gt;If you really wanted to get the summer benefit of the oil cooler, why
&gt;couldn't you have two locations prepared for mounting the cooler/heater (one
&gt;external summer mount; one internal winter mount).
&gt;
&gt;Would there be problems related to the distance the oil might have to be
pumped?
&gt;
&gt;I know the gas heaters are nice, but I don't have one anymore and I'm not so
&gt;sure that I want to invest in an older model, especially when Espar doesn't
&gt;even sell all the parts for them anymore.
&gt;
&gt;Comments, flames, etc. appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks! Joe

  I should shorten your post but it all seems salient so I'm leaving it.

 Barney's Imports has one like this for bugs including the &quot;move it
out in the summer&quot; setup.

 It is mounted on the inside of the firewall under rear window.

 Says &quot;fan assisted oil-cooler&quot; and implies tie-in to &quot;full-flow 
oil system&quot;.

 As for the length of runs, air is terrible for keeping heat and oil
is the best.

 You would get better heat to the cooler than a water system.

 No more of the flames on this . Do a simple test. Put a bucket of each at X
temp in the open air and see which maintains it's heat the
longest.

 What I would want is two coolers tho, in the same system with simple
shut-off/bypass valves on them.

 I route it outside in the summer and inside in the winter.

 There are draw-backs. Not much volume in the oil system and I still
have to keep the oil temp in the engine above, say 100 degrees in the
winter.

 Moving that much oil on a real cold morning could be a real strain.

 It could be calculated but I wouldn't care to make a guess if it 
would be successful as the single heat source.

 It is a nice engineering problem. What if you then ran some coils 
around the exhaust system to pick up that heat too?

 Maybe put an auxilliary oil pump on a pressure switch to overcome 
that cold oil problem. Cut-out when it got the oil temp up.
