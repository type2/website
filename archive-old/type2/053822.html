Subject: RE: Where in Indiana?

I am from mishawaka just east of South Bend.  Thanks Tim for your opinion
of the carbs.  I think i am however leaning for the dual webbers then
rebuilding the stock ones for spare.(If anyone disagrees with this please
let me know)  I have another question:   If i go with the Webbers what size
should i go with 32's 34's or 40's?  Besides price does anyone know how
well each size performs.  My engine is 1800cc. I am also thinking about
switching froom points to an electronic setup that i saw in Rocky Mountain
Motor Works if anyone has any informaition on that i would lke to know
thanks.

&gt; 
&gt; I just saw your post on type2_dot_com.  Where in Indiana are you located?? 
I'm
&gt; in Fort Wayne.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as your carburetors, I would be inclined to keep the original dual
&gt; carbs.  You might have to rebuild them, but its not terribly expensive or
&gt; difficult.  New carbs usually mean a weber or some other setup that wasn't
&gt; necessarily designed vor a bus application.  They will work, but also will
&gt; require a lot of tuning, setup and sometimes different timing adjustments
&gt; to get them to run right.  These new carb setups usually don't come with a
&gt; hot air induction system which is necessary to prevent carb icing and
&gt; crappy running in cold weather.  If you buy new, non-stock carbs, you will
&gt; have a non-stock bus that a lot of mechanics will not touch because there
&gt; are no manuals or other specs which discuss the particular setup you have.
&gt; In the long run, getting your stock carbs to work properly will be the
&gt; least expensive and more reliable way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion for what its worth.
&gt; 
&gt; Good to have you on the list
