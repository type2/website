Subject: RE:Westfalia insurance

Hi everyone,

Someone on the list had inquired about insurance for their Westy so here is my .02.
I just got some fantastic insurance for one of my VW's.  It is from a place in Michigan called
Hagarty classic insurance.  It is different from most collectible insurance companies because 
there is NO mileage limitations.  You just have to provide 1 photo of your car and send in the
application.  This company even considers the modifications you make on your vehicle a plus,
which is very unusual.  Their website is www.hagerty_dot_com if you want to check it out.
I have no affiliation with this company but I am pleased to say that I am paying $86 a year for
my VW and can drive it as often as I like without having to worry about limited mileage.
Just figured I would pass it along.

Regards,
Kurt Makoske
