Subject: Re: [T2] jack stands-non steel options

My first home-made effort with my 71 Westy was to make my own ramps,
using pieces of 2x4&quot;'s standing vertically, taper cut on the ramp upper
side and nailed to a piece of plywood on each side.  I made 1'8&quot; deep
cuts into the ramp plywood (5/8&quot; thick) to create ridges  for tire
gripping.   Worked great until they rotted from leaving outside too
long....my favorite current purchased ramps are made from a &quot;waffle&quot;
pattern in plastic and cannot collapse in the center, cannot rust,
cannot dig into asphalt, and are lighter than the steel ones.  The
rating is also higher, like 5 tons.  Only negative was that when I tried
to use them on a hily asphalted driveway to level the Westy, they
scooted across the road!  Placing them on a piece of carpet that
extended out beyond so the wheel rolls on the carpet first fixed that. 
If I jack up the rear, these can be slipped under the frame as
insurance.
