&gt; I've got just about all of the bits that I need, but I'm missing
&gt; the left-hand side piece of tin that sits to the rear of #4, attaching
&gt; below the main left cylinder bank cover piece.
&gt; The trivia?  I've got two right-hand-side pieces, but they're
&gt; different:  one has a ~1-inch ellipse neatly cut in the outboard
end, and
&gt; the other is solid.  What's the purpose of the hole?

It's there for a heat riser, AFAIK.  If you don't have a heat riser
then you don't need the hole.

The left and right pieces are far from symmetrical.  The right piece
has a cutout for the heat riser and for the road draft tube.
