Subject: Re: Brake drum saga continues...

Hi Jenn
had the same problem with my '70, rear drum needed major persuasion to come 
off.
If the drum has never been off, two things have likely happened
1. the shoe has worn a grove in the drum effectively capturing the drum.
    Make sure you have the shoes all the way retracted
2. The drum has rusted to the splines making what is a tight fit when new, 
next to impossible to remove when rusted. 

if you've already checked #1 the only thing left is brute force. I would 
squirt a penetrate liberally in all the splines. I would use your puller to 
keep a constant tension on the drum, tight, but not so much as to distort the 
puller. Now the fun part, I would work my way around the drum whacking the 
snot out of it. Your doing this to break the rust and tension on the splines. 
Use a heavy brass hammer not a ball peen, you'll be less likely to have 
shards of metal whack you in the eye. Now you'll need some form of a drift, 
just means a short piece of metal, because now you want to whack around the 
inner edge of the drum, but you don't want to whack the backing plate, their 
getting to hard to find. You have to alternate your blows, this means you 
give it several whacks in the same place then turn the drum 180o and whack 
somemore, turn the drum 90o and repeat. What you are doing is walking the 
drum off the spline.At first you won't see any movement but have faith it 
will move. On my 70 I had to whack one side all the way to the end. Having a 
puller is a big plus because you can keep tightening and keep tension on the 
drum. Have fun and don't hit any fingers, it really hurts in the cold.
