&gt;&gt; I can't seem to get the vacuum to go any higher.  Right now it's 15-16&quot; or

&gt;&gt; factory maybe).

&gt; That sucks.  &lt;I couldn't pass that up&gt;
&gt; What is your timing at?  Should be 7.5 before at idle.

I redid the timing because I measured the dwell a couple of weeks later and
it went from 50 to 52.5.  When I timed it two days ago I set it to:

Idle: 880
Dwell: 47.8 at idle (46.7 at 2000 rpm)
Timing: 7.5 BTDC
Vacuum: at least 17&quot;

I was really happy then but now the vacuum is reading lower and I don't know
why.
