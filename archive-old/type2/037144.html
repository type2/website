Thanks for the responses.

I do remember him pushing to the right, where a new 5-speed shifter would
have reverse.

I'll check out the ball/cup tonight to make sure he didn't knock something
out of kilter.

&gt; Your gearshift goes into a little ball that fits in to a cup like thing
that
&gt; is on the linkage and when the mechanic was looking for reverse he went to
&gt; far to the right and popped the ball out of the cup.  When you pulled up
on
&gt; the shifter you got it to fall back into the cup

&gt; &gt; The petroleum engineer had to back Itch up to check the front end.
&gt; &gt; Apparently gets into reverse, but the tranny locks the rear wheels cold,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; then the gear shift won't go into or out of any &quot;gear&quot;, unless I unload
&gt; &gt; pressure on the rear wheels. The shift pattern is unrecognizable. What
&gt; feels
&gt; &gt; like neutral is some forward gear (I hit the starter with the clutch
out,
&gt; &gt; and it felt like it was in third gear).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Life turns into hell.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After 15 minutes of fiddling, I made some gear changes pulling up on the
&gt; &gt; shifter, and something must have gone right, 'cuz at some point, Itch
&gt; &gt; shifted as if nothing ever happened. Drove him this W/E without
problems,
&gt; &gt; and to work today w/o problems. It's just as if nothing happened.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What happened?
