Subject: Just purchased a '77 bus -- engine ???
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Hello, list!  I'm new to the bus scene, having just purchased a '77 
bus.  The body, interior, and most mechanicals are in great shape, but the 
engine is in several boxes in the rear of the bus.

There are a couple local shops which come well-recommended, but my first 
attempt will be to re-assemble the engine myself.

I've heard that the '77 engine had some problems and was changed 
mid-year.  How can I tell what year my engine is?  Thanks for any info 
available.
