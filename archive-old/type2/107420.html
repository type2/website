Subject: eating spark plugs

My engine eats spark plugs.  I seem to experience 2 types of failure.  The
first is that I get a black sooty coating on the plug which obviously
suggests incomplete combustion- and that I am running rich.

btw this is a stock 1600 running a 34 pict-3 stock VW carb.

I rebuilt my carb last year, and the float chamber seemed fine, I replaced
all the standard parts you replace with an off the shelf carb-rebuild kit,
washing and checking the jets but no obvious signs of damage.

My airfilter is a pancake and I have washed the filter so there is nothing
impedeing the inflow of air.  I can tune the carb to my hearts content to
set the mixture at idle, but nothing as far as cruising.  I am not running
stock exhaust but an aftermarket glasspack one, could this be impeding air
intake?

So the first consumer of spark plugs is that they get covered is soot and
need taking out and cleaning every few 100 miles, but that's nothing other
than a slight chore.

The second is that they get bent.  From what I can figure out- as this is
primarily a problem with cylinder no.1.  Is that during running, the
obviously hot threaded contact between plug and lead, bends presumably due
to the bending stress placed on it by the HT lead.  This eventually leads to
failure of the plug.  I have checked and the lead is not pushing that hard
on the plug, so the bending stress is due to little more than self-weight of
the lead!!!...

Do anyone elses plug tops 'bend' in this way? Is this an early warning that
my no.1 is running far too hot?  Engine is coming out next w/e so will check
tin and everything, just wondered if there was anything else I should
particularly look out for.

cheers for any help, it is much appreciated.
