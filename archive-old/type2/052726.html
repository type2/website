Rob:
Stewart Warner made those things since clear back in the 40's so it could be
just about anything. I imagine they made them for most any vehicle the National
Guard might have owned. There is a faily good chance that if it's in the right
year range the thing might be pretty similar to a VW one. I've got some old
catalogs somewhere and it seems to fit most models S-W just rearranged parts
with a few different brackets.
Good luck in your quest.
