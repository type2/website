Subject: Re: [T2] Torque wrenches (was: Snap-on is crazy)

Despite the fact that my last name was Anglicized in the 
seventeen-hundreds, I guess I'm still German enough that I want to look 
at an instrument rather than trust my wrist, which didn't do its 
homework and skipped classes to hang out with the other wrists.

&gt; In all honesty mark, anything that low of torque, I just use an

&gt; wrist. :-) Snug with a short wrench is tight enough at that level of 
&gt; torque.
&gt; Of course I've wrenched for years, and I am def. NOT Arnold 
&gt; Swcharzeger .
