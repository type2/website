Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Levels

[...]

A bit too much oil can do a _lot_ of mischief, under certain circumstances.

It's not uncommon to get an oil level reading on a 1600 engine that
indicates the need for as much as a quart of motor oil, when the engine
actually has a full crankcase.  If another quart of oil is added based on
the erroneous reading, the engine could be a quart over full.

Running a VW 1600 engine with a quart too much oil can result in problems
ranging from excess oil blowing/spraying all over the place, to blown oil
seal(s), to hydrostatic lock and a ruined engine.

It's well worth the time to make sure you have an accurate oil level reading
before dumping in more motor oil.  The engine you save could be your
own.....

&gt;&gt;  ...just try to keep the oil level as close to maximum as possible (as
far as you can read it anyway), a little bit too much oil won't hurt I
think.  &lt;&lt;
