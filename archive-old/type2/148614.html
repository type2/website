Subject: How I used rubber bands to make my bus go faster

OK,

So this is a total hack, but it worked wonders.

I realized yesterday the accelerator pedal spring was broken, making
the carb throttle return spring do all the work of closing the
throttle plate and returning the accelerator pedal to its height. This
which meant that the throttle cable couldn't possibly be correctly
adjusted - it needed a lot of slack to let the throttle plate fully
close - the return spring just couldn't do it all alone. And
furthermore the accelerator pedal would not return to its full height.
 So I used some rubber bands rigged between the pedal and the parking
brake handle to make the pedal return to its proper height and the
readjusted the throttle cable. Now I can get closer to full open
throttle resulting in a noticeable performance increase.

Now I've just got to drive this accelerator pedal pin out and get the
new spring installed so the bus doesn't look so much like a Rube
Goldberg device :)

I always joked with my friends about fixing the bus with rubber bands
and paperclips, just didn't actually think I'd get a chance. YMMV
