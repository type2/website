Subject: Points lubrication

Hi All,



I recently replaced the points in my 81 vanagon westy. The points did
not come with the little capsule of grease like they used to, and I am
sorry to say that I forgot to put some on them after installing and
timing the engine. By the end of my camping trip they were toast, the
engine would break up if I tried to rev to high and had lousy
acceleration. What kind of lubrication should I use when I install the
next set?



Thanks

-Jeff
