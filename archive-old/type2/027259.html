Hey. I just joined the T2 list, I've been on vintagebus for a number of 
months (67 deluxe).

Anyway. I just bought an ebay 69 Westy in Yuma and I have to get it here to 
L.A.

I was wondering if any of you folks in AZ were plannig a trip out here any 
time soon, and would have the means/desire to help out a fellow ACVW freak.

Just looking for options.

Thanks,
Jason
