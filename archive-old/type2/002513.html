Hi All,
Its been awhile since I've posted due to moving etc.
To get you up to speed, I'm rebuilding my 1600 SP in my '70 Westy.
I have had TONS of questions but most of them has been answered by the
archives.

So, to cut to the chase I am putting in a new camshaft and the gear came
separately (Both Bugpack).  I can find no torque specs for the gear to the
shaft.
Should I use Loctite?
Any info would help.

As a side note - since this is my first rebuild I think I am experiencing
some sort of pre-engine assembly anxiety.
Anyone else remember this happening? :)

Ciao
