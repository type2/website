&lt;&lt; Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?   &gt;&gt;
hello all      They make  christmas lites that are 12 volt.   I had some on 
my 66 westy's roof rack in last years parade.    I don't know where my wife 
found them but they worked real well and just pluged into the liter.    Mark
