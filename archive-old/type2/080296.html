&gt;&gt; I use Valvoline SynPower 5W50. It meets the API SJ/CF.

&gt;where are you still finding the 5W50, I used to use 5W50 Pennzoil but they
&gt;discontinued it, now all I can find is Castrol 5W50???

I got it in Holland, bought it by the box, (12 one liter bottles)
My FLAPS had to order it for me though. Since it's Valvoline 
I assumed I would be able to get it around here. I hope I'll 
be able to get it around here somehow. 

Also, the oillight coming on between 11 and 15 PSI is not standard 
VW. The stock switch closes around 6.5 PSI in most uprights. I used 
a Porsche switch/sender combo for the light and gauge.
