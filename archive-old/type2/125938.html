That's almost as bad as having a water cooled engine in perfect condition. :-)

&gt;Do I need to change the oil again? Will the whitish emulsion clear once the 
&gt;engine gets runnning for extended periods of time? Is this going to shorten 
&gt;the life of the engine? 

Water makes a poor bearing lubricant. I'd change the oil again as cheap insurance.
