It's not hard when you are in the right, and most of the people reading

I've had a few little parts messed up on orders.  However, Ron was also
nice enough to make good on a missing tailpipe in an order that I
didn't bother to unpack and check for nearly a year.  One phone call, no
questions, part arrived two days later.
