&gt; What are the possible causes of an immedialte loss of both brake lights.

Barry,

Jason has a very good point.  The bulbs are installed and replaced at the
same time, and thus tend to blow at about the same time.  You may have had
one out for a while but it didn't excite comment until the second blew.

If both bulbs check good, it's time to dig out the VOM and track down the
break in the circuit.  This will require either an assistant or a big
brick :-)

First, turn on the ignition (unplug the coil), set the VOM to measure DC
volts, attach the black lead to the body and check for 12V at the black
wires on both master cylinder switches.  This is marked terminal 82a on
the switch if (a) it is original and (b) it is clean enough.  If you don't
have 12V, then check the fuse again and check the wire from fuse 11 to the
MC switches.

Second, put the test lead on terminal 81 of each of the switches.  This
will be a black wire with a red stripe.  When the brakes are depressed,
this should get 12V.  If it does not, the switch is bad.

Third, the wire is interupted by an 8-point connector in the engine
compartment (I *think* at the fan) look there for the black wire with red
trace and check it for 12V when the brakes are depressed.

Then check the tail light buckets for 12V when the brakes are depressed.

Sorry.  It's a messy job to do there at the office :-(
