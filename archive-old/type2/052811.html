Volks,

As Nikki said earlier this evening, I was out in Los Angeles this past
weekend and we had a go at restoring the nose on her bus at least to the
point where she could drive it.  The problem was that the deer hit had
smashed the passenger's side headlamp assembly and left the bucket pointed
at the ground beyond the range of the adjuster.  The nose skin will still
need replacemnet (and I believe the &quot;A&quot; pillar as well) but we pulled the
dent to the point that we could install a replacement hedlamp assembly.

Because I figure this procedure might be of some use, I have written up a
page and put it at:

Please note that this is an inherently dangerous procedure!  You are
working with massive forces here and a failure of the chain or cable can
cut you right in half!  The job requires two people, one to sight for
progress and one to drive. The person doing the sighting should be careful
and by all means *stand back* from the cable while it is under tension.
