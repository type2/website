Never ask them that way. Phone or come armed with the part number, they'll
reply with a description and whether or not their depots have any in stock.
If they ask you for what kind of vehicle and you detect the &quot;3rd degree&quot; say
you are running an errand. The only defense they have towards not helping
you is that they are a--holes.

I finally lucked out and found a nearby dealer with a parts guy who owns a
79 bus and doesn't mind searching ETKA. Sunnyvale Volkswagen on El Camino
near Wolfe. What a difference compared to those jerks in TX that outright
lied and told me ETKA only lets them search back to 1983.
