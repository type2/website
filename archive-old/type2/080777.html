&gt; &lt;&lt; Despite its non-scientific nature, it seems that there is something to
&gt; dowsing.  We did an experiment in an old classroom with flip-to desks,
&gt; concealing a gallon of water in one of the desks, and a significant number
&gt; of the students were successful in finding the water.

&gt; Ever hear of Clever Hans, the horse that could add? He really could,
&gt; but only if the person asking how much was such and such was in view.
&gt; Hans was clever, alright, he picked up the imperceptable &quot;something&quot;
&gt; that the person did when he stamped his hoof the right number of
&gt; times.

Dowsing works. We used to find water pipes buried in concrete using bent
coat hangers.
