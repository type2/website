Subject: Re: [T2] die grinder

James,
After reading your posting, just for grins I did a search on electric
die grinder's--
There is a whole bunch for sale-Harbor Freight to mention one of the
purveyors.

Then for a real thrill--I went to E-Bay---

Check it out--there is a whole wad of 
them for sale--

The world is at your command here on the internet--

Have fun--

Terry

I have done a lot of welding on my 73 Westfalia and now have a lot of
grinding to do, much of it in tight spots where my angle grinder won`t
reach or would gouge more of the surrounding metal than the weld itself.
I have an air die grinder and other great air tools, but at the moment,
I have no electrical outlet for running my compressor. Also, my 6hp
(probably an overrated hp) compressor has a hard time keeping up with
the constant grinding I have had to do. I am basically looking for an
electric die grinder if something like that exists. I have a Dremel, but
it is pretty small and would probably burn out if subjected to the miles
of lumpy weld beads that I would use it on. Has anyone out there heard
of an electric die ginder? Something like an air die grinder only
electric. Any help is always appreciated. Thanks, James.
