Subject: RE: Swamp Coolers

Hi Chris:

I've never had a swamp cooler, but I've seen them.  My understanding is
that they work pretty well in areas of low humidity, like the desert.  They
work on the concept of evaporation of water into passing air (which takes
BTUs from the air) to make water vapor.  Great idea except that when the
humidity is high, the air has less capacity for additional water, making
evaporation occur much more slowly, resulting in less cooling effect.  I
lived near Raleigh for several years and know that it is often very humid
there.  I question whether a evaporation cooler would do much good for you.
