Subject: cargo door handle problem

Hello everyone,

I recently installed a cargo door handle on my 70 Westie.  The original
was missing.  I ordered from one of the big online vw stores, and it
definitely installed and functions like it was meant to be there. The
problem is that when I open the door all the way, the handle hits the
body before the holder latch thing can engage.  Here's what I mean...

It bends the handle....

The door works great in all respects, and before the handle was put on,
the &quot;holder latch thing&quot; worked fine.  

The handle is listed &quot;fits 1968-1979 Bus&quot;.  Could my door be out of
whack?  I can be careful, but I'm sure one of my friends will fling the
door back, breaking the handle.  I called the place I got it from, and
they were friendly as can be, but basically said it's not a problem
they've heard of before, and that the handle is genuine for my year.  I
know the Westies had a different handle, but this was so you could
operate it with the sink in the way, right?

On another note, right after I took the door pic (15 mins ago), I
figured that I'd open the windows in preparation for work.  Here's what
happened when I moved the side mirror, to open the vent window...

Oh no!!  :)

Anyone know if I can just get the glass and seal (gasket?)  The glass
seemed to have a fabric backing.  


Thanks for any help,
Jon Wade
