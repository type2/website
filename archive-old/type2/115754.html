&gt; I just noticed in Bentley where it says to tape the spline so as not to
&gt; harm the boot (oops). I'm going to try this next, see how it goes. I'm
&gt; afraid this will just add several mils to an already too-tight spot.

I had this problem too. I tried using grease then I tried some plastic but
it kept tearing and getting caught between the boot and the axle. Then I
tried using some slightly thicker plastic AND greased the plastic and the
boot finally went on without damage.
