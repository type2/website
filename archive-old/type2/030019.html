&gt; What are  the metric thread values for a spark plug? Any idea where such a
&gt; metric thread chaser can be purchased?

You can buy them at most any tool shop.  Take in a plug to match the
threads.

You can also make your own.  Take an old long-reach plug, break out the
insulator and break off the side electrode.  Take a saw and make two
perpendicular cuts about 1/2 the length of the threads.  Remove any burrs
from the cuts on the threads.  Bend the cut portion of the threads out
slightly.  You now have a thread chaser!  Run it in and out once every
time you take the plugs out and it'll prevent carbon buildup.
