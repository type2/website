Subject: Re: clattering '72 noise--rod bearing or wrist pin?

&gt;my nagging feeling is that the noise sounds too superficial and is too
&gt;clearly connected to combustion to be the rod bearing--but would the
&gt;wrist pin still fit the bill?  i dont know about wrist pins going bad.

Maybe a cap bolt came loose? Or maybe you accidentally left a clip off a
wrist pin, and the pin has worked its way out to where it's banging on the
edge of the bore?
