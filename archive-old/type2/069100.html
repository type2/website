Subject: Re: oil weight

&gt;
&gt;Which weight oil should I use in my '78 during the winter?  I use 10w-30 in
&gt;the summer, is this even right?  That's what my dad told me to use, but I
&gt;don't exaclty trust him all the way...  Reply privately, please.  Everyone
&gt;else probably knows this stuff.

     I scanned and posted the official VW information from the Bentley 
Type 2 manual on my web site. You have to go directly there, though, 
since I didn't want to link it and have Bentely find out through 
AltaVista or some such. The URL is 
http://ccwf.cc.utexas_dot_edu/~ehintz/oilfaq.html That's the official word on 
it, and you'll find all kinds of personal opinons and testimonies from 
the list...

Peace,
