Subject: Head swap up date from Matt

Hey guys.  For those of you following my story here is an update.
 
As you know after a 3000km trip in my bus I lost power on the way home.
After inspecting I found a hole had been burnt through one of the heads
(about 1 cm in diameter) I had another head so I decided to swap it.
Unfortunately the cylinder jug had been welded to the melting head.  So I
removed the cylinder head and jug together.  I replaced the jug and head
with parts from another engine I had.  I thought I had used good technique
in getting the jug in but after I got everything together and started the
van and noticed that it is now burning more oil than an Iraqi dictator. I
must have damaged a ring.  The smoke isn't so bad while driving but at idle
it is very obvious.
