Subject: Re: [T2] Weber 34 ict questions

 &gt;I bought a set of 2nd hand weber 34 icts from the Samba and have a few
 &gt;questions about installing them on my 2l TypeIV engine in a 76 van.

 &gt;Firstly, it seems to be impossible to tighten the lower two nuts that
 &gt;fasten the manifold to each head. The nuts barely clear the manifold making
 &gt;it impossible to get a socket on them.


Thanks to those who pointed out that 12mm nuts would give me enough 
clearance to do them up. I haven't tried it, but it should do the trick. 
Now I'm torn between being pleased that the solution was easy and kicking 
myself that I didn't think of it!

Now to find close up pictures of the linkages at the carbs...


Cheers,

Martin.
