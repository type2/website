Subject: Timing marks?

New o-ring on distributor, got distributor reinstalled tonight, &quot;ok, 
time to fire it up and time it!&quot;

Pull fan grille, wipe off grime... &quot;hm, where are the numbers on the 
timing scale?&quot;

Please refer to the picture:

	http://www.shagadelic_dot_org/photos/pod/timing-marks.jpg

Firstly, I'm going to assume that that is, in fact, the timing scale on 
the left side of the pulley (the silver thing).  I cleaned and 
inspected both sides, no numbers written on it that I can see.  
However, someone clearly, at some point, marked it -- the scratch there 
is deep and deliberate.  There is also a grease pencil/chalk line on 
the fan housing above it, and I turned the engine over to line up that 
mark on the pulley that you also see in the photo.  There is a similar 
mark 180 degrees away on the pulley.  At the other mark, the rotor was 
pointed at cylinder #3.  I assume that the rotor is now 1/4 of the way 
between #3 and #4, since I turned it 180 degrees to get to the mark you 
see here, though I didn't look at it since I ran out of light and was 
getting hungry.

Bentley says 7.5 BTDC for my '76.  Does that mark look like it's in the 
right place?

As always, your help and support are greatly appreciated.
