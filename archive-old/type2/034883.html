Subject: Free Rear Hatch Screen

In response to an incredible act of kindness just bestowed upon me, I'm now 
responding in kind: Free for the asking, one new rear hatch screen for any 
late bay-window type 2. Original from a 1979 Westy. Never used, in new 
condition. First reply gets it, I'll pay for shipping in the continental US.
Thanks Folks, this list is the BEST!
