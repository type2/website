Subject: CCC Mammoth Aftermath (Phx)

Late Sunday afternoon, 09/22/96, VanBondo was attempting to mow the sliver
of lawn in the rear of the &quot;Rusty Ranch.&quot; The Mrs. appeared in front of me
in an attempt to communicate something. Sign language/gestures indicate that
there was a telephone call.
Who is it?, I asked.
RRRRRRRRRRRR (the mower roars)
&quot;Joel Endave.&quot; said she.
RRRRRRRRRRRR (the mower roars)
WHO!? I dont know any one by that name!
RRRRRRRRRRRR (the mower still roars)
OK, whatever...
RRRRRRRR-pffft (the mower stops)

It was Unca Joel Walker and Dave Swartze (Joel AND Dave not Joel Endave)
calling from Barstow, CA calling to confirm an understood invitation to
crash at the &quot;VanBondo Ranch.&quot; The come ahead was given with the
understanding that they would arrive &quot;late/early.&quot;
True to their word they arrived at 02:30 (AM) MST. A sleepy tour of the '67
RFH was given. It seems that Joel thought all of my stories were just
VanBondo blowing it out of his &quot;tail pipe.&quot; Nope~!
Everyone crashed for a few more hours of rest. These folks had driven
straight through from from Dallas to the weekend's CCC gathering in
California. Then they drove straight from the event to my house. Now I know
what crazy is.

The crazy (but polite) car pool twosome passed on offers of breakfast and
coffee and took off in Dave's &quot;DaBoat&quot; Safare camper into the early morining
with fresh directions to local Phoenix junkyards in hand... Whew~!
Thanks for stopping guys!
