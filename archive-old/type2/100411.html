Subject: Fwd: air bypass &amp; idle mixture settings for brazilian solex
  30/31?

Hi, Emerson--

Sorry for the delay in replying--since my original post 'way back when, I've 
mostly changed email addresses.

I'll give you the bad news first: In the end, I just took the bus to a local 
VW mechanic who put the tach on it, slipped an exhaust sensor on, and dialed 
it in [in about a minute] for $20.  I haven't fiddled [or had to fiddle] 
with the adjustments since, so I honestly can't tell you what settings he 
arrived at.

I considered carefully screwing the jets all the way in, counting the turns, 
then backing them out exactly, just so I'd know what the new settings were, 
but I figured that was just sucking around for trouble since it was running 
fine.

And at least that is the good news: Once the mechanic did his 60-second 
thing, I have had zero trouble with it in two years. I'm a happy 30/31 
owner.

Hey, List Members--here's one I can't remember the answer to: Should you 
dial in the carb FIRST, then check timing and dwell, or get timing and dwell 
right, THEN adjust the carb?

Good luck, Emerson--sorry I couldn't be more help.

&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;Greetings Bill....I read your post in the archive; but couldn't
&gt;find a reply to your question.  I have the same delima with my carb (solex 
&gt;30/31) and wondered if you could offer a baseline for beginning 
&gt;adjustments; I am all over the place and am making no real headway.  Thanks 
&gt;Emerson Smith,
