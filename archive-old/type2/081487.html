Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Engine removal question.

The master engine remover John Erickson showed me just once how to remove my
type 4 engine (without removing the tranny). I had never removed an engine
before.

 After reinstalling the new rebuilt engine I realized that GoWesty sold me
the wrong flywheel, so I had to remove the engine again and install it by
myself..no help. I didn't have any problems then either.

They are not as bad as some make them sound.

Good luck!!

&gt; All this talk of T4 buses has me scared witless... It
&gt; took 6 hours with me and a guy that works on american
&gt; cars to pull and install a T2 engine in a 68 Westy.  I
&gt; have a chance to buy a pair of T4 buses, one needs to
&gt; have the engine/trans of the other.  I am not sure
&gt; that I am up the the task of swapping the T4s... I
&gt; guess if I buy, then I will learn.  Thanks for the
&gt; posts on this topic, it is educational.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So here I sit.. dirty, tired and greasy, with my
&gt; &gt; engine half out of my
&gt; &gt; &gt; bus.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm stuck, I'm cursing at myself loudly, and I
&gt; &gt; think I might have
&gt; &gt; &gt; called the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I managed to pull the engine as far as I can to
&gt; &gt; the rear apron. and now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking between the engine and trans I see (a
&gt; &gt; mile I guessed in anger) the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; input shaft seemingly has gotten longer... or
&gt; &gt; its coming out of the trans.
