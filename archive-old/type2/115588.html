Subject: Re: Glow Plug Question

I have the exact same problem with my heater.  It will work great for about 
a month of regular use, then it will not ignite, setting off the safety 
switch.  When this happens, I have to clean fluffy black deposits off the 
plug and it works great again.  I thought this might be because of an 
overich mixture.  I checked the fuel pump output which turned out to be 
within normal ranges.  I didn`t want to lean out the mixture because I was 
afraid it might make the heater run hot.  I would much rather just clean the 
plug.  BTW, I have 3 old plugs that I have tried, all with the same result.  
So I am left with 3 theories:  Rich mixture, worn ignition coil or worn 
plug.  Surely there is some Eberspacher Guru out there on the list who has 
run across this problem.  Wasn`t there a heater conference somewhere in the 
mid west a few years back?  I would certainly appreciate any help or input.

Thanks, James
