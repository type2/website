Subject: amaaco in Portland OR

Don't want to start another huge painting thread....because I know
it's been done to death....but does anyone have an opinion one way or
another about the Amaaco in Portland OR? Ever had work done there,
etc.... I need to get my bus painted and I'm working on a budget, but
I won't take it there if someone has a horror story.

Thanks,
Scott
