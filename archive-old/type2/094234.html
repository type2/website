Subject: Re: [T2] engine woes - part 2

On my '72, 1700 cc with a dual vacuum distributor (205E, I think),
34-PDSIT 2/3 carbs:

There are connections to each manifold that are connected to each other and
to the vacuum booster.  There is a tube located approximately where you
would imagine putting a fuel injector.  There is a boss there for each
cylinder, but there is only one on each manifold, on the front cylinders, #
1 and #3.  This is clearly the manifold vacuum.  They are big connections,
maybe 1/2&quot; dia.  I think that later buses have a different configuration
here.

The venturi vacuum is on the left only carb and points left, away from the
centerline of the engine.  This goes to the vacuum canister on the
distributor, the vacuum canister port that points away from the centerline
of the distributor.  Vacuum here advances the timing.  This is a small dia.
tube.  Maybe 1/8&quot; id.

There is an additional vacuum that is connected to the throttle body and
that is manifold vacuum.  It is connected to the vacuum canister on the
distributor, the port that points towards the centerline of the distributor.
Vacuum here retards the timing.  This is a slightly larger diameter tube,
maybe .1875&quot;, or so.

Hope that helps.

&gt; First, thank you all that responded yesterday.
&gt; 
&gt; Now my woes....
&gt; 
&gt; I crawled under the bus last night and plugged the vac line going to the brake
&gt; booster.  It did not seem to make a change for the better.  I finally got the
&gt; bus to idle and put the timing light on it.  It was at about 3ATDC.  Hmmm...
&gt; then I got to thinking, maybe when I took the dizzy out awhile ago, I put the
&gt; vac lines on backwards.  Which hoses go where?  Or should I say, which port on
&gt; the left carb is the advance?  I switched the hoses anyways, just to see.  I
&gt; started the bus, it idledat about 800RPM for about 30 secs, then increased to
&gt; around 12-1500RPM.  The advance also increased, could not tell where it was.
&gt; Can anyone lend a couple of brain cells on this one?  Oh yeah, after I
&gt; switched the hoses, the timing was at 5BTDC at 900RPM idle
