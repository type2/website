&gt; &gt; Don't laugh...As late as '62 MGA's had a hole in the bumper and a

&gt;
&gt; I wonder if the German military had cranks in their VWs?  The military
&gt; tends to keep redundant systems around longer than the commercial sector.

at volksblast a couple weeks back there were 2 euro military things. I
think the later one was a 76 the other one was a similar vintage.
they both had gas heaters and crank starts,
I believe the handle went through the bumper.
