Subject: Re: [T2] carb air filter question

Michael,

Or, I am sure that they would be happy to sell you a new complete 
after-market chrome air cleaner that takes  *round* filters.

Available in the &quot;hot rod&quot; aftermarket section of most flaps...
Make sure round will work for you and then buy the diameter and height
that fits well.....buy them by &quot;neck&quot; size or take your old air cleaner in 
and match it.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Just getting the bus ready to run and I am having a hard time finding a replacement air filter for the Holley/weber progressive carb that is on my 2.0.  The filter unit sits right on top of the carb between two chrome plates (one on top and one on the bottom).  It is about 5x8 inches rectangle with a paper/metal mesh in a rubber housing.  I took the old filter to FLAPS and they looked at me as if I was smoking something.  Maybe I was, but you have to be able to get replacements somewhere.....
