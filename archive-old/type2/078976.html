&gt; For camping, you can put a house thermostat on your heater and it will work
&gt; like a house furnace, coming on and shutting off to keep your bus at a
&gt; constant temperature all night long.  And gas heaters won't put extra
&gt; moisture or fumes in the air.
&gt; 

I have been told by someone I respect that all combustion of hydrocarbons 
result in moisture being given of, or do you mean that this gas heater 
exhausts to atmosphere rather than in side the bus? regards Mel
