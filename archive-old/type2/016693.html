Subject: Any rec. for good shop in Sunnyvale, CA area?

Hi y'all,

First, the details:  As one thing leads to another, my '72 westy's ball
joints are shot, my alignment's bad, and my tires are worn out.  I was
planning on doing the ball joints myself, BUT I really would like to
have new tires before driving in the snow in December (already did it
for Thanksgiving), AND I won't put new tires on until the alignment's
good, AND OF COURSE things at the office are crazy for the foreseeable
future, SO I need to find someone to do the work for me.

Thus, I seek the collective wisdom of the list:  anyone have a
recommendation for a shop near Sunnyvale, CA?  Bugformance is down the
street from me, and they are my first choice based on proximity, but
I've never had *anyone* besides myself work on my bus before... I'm
reluctant to give my precious bus over to a shop without a solid
referral from someone who has personally had work done there.

As always, thanks for your support...

-chad
