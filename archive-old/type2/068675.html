&gt;lets see. reasons for nonstart:

&gt;no gas. got it.
&gt;no gas getting to engine. should be now...

Nuh-uh. In rhetoric we would call that an elision. ;)

You spilled gas, so you know you have gas *to the fuel pump*. You need gas
in the cylinders, which takes a lot more proving. Hole in your diaphram,
well, it might try to catch six or eight times but never start. Like it
done did. ;)
