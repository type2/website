Dear All,

I am trying to get to the bottom of my overheating problem, after checking
all the obvious.

I have a 2litre engine with carbs. There is a diaphragm type vacuum unit, on
the elbow from the air cleaner, that controls whether  warm air from No.1
cylinder head or cold air flows into the air filter.  The vacuum pipe to the
contol unit comes from the bottom of the air filter box, via what I presume
to be a temp switch on the ducting between the air filter and the right hand
carb.

According to Haynes the switch should allow only  cold air  to be fed to the
air filter, when the outside air temp is warm.

We had a hot day in the UK today, about 21C yet the control flap was at
about 45degrees letting half the air come from outside and half from No1
cylinder.  This is with the engine warm (110c). I would have thought that
all the air should have been coming from the cool source.

Should I disconnect the pipe and bung it so that all the air comes from the
cool source?

Is there a way of fixing the temp switch or replacing it?

Is the switch working correctly and the engine always requires some hot air
as well as cool for the intake?

I would be gratefull of any help.

Thankyou.
