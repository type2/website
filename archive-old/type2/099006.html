&gt;Can a T2 engine be expected to idle normally (900 RPM) with the points dwell 
&gt;set at 15 degrees?

Yes.  In an earlier posting a while back, my &quot;dwell went south&quot; and it was reading between 11-21 on my dwell meter.  Idle was fine but it would clug terribly under acceleration.

As a side note, I discovered embarassingly that my bus will idle without the connector from the ECU to AFM attached but it will conk out once you apply the slightest amount of gas pedal.
