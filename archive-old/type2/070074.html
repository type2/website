Subject: Oil Light flickering

Hello once again. I have a problem. Returning from Memphis this weekend, my oil
light came on. I immediatly pulle over and checked for leaks but there where 
none. The dipstick didn't show that I was low either but I was still cautious 
about driving. I hitchhiked to the nearest town and bought some oil and hitched
on back and put the oil in. Started it up sounded fine and there were no leaks
except for the normal dribble they all have. The oil light was still flickering though. I drove fairly slow to the same gas station and let it sit for an hour
and let it start again and the light was still on wavering back and forth.
I still drove it back to Little 
Rock with out a hitch and ran into no problems. Question what could be wrong?
Will the light go on if the oil pump goes out? Or what would be a good way to 
check the indicator light to see if it is not fried? 

Peace and a frog
