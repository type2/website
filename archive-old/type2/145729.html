Because they both had 2 cylinders?  :)

It's a relatively secure high-current connector.  Much better than the
&quot;cigarette lighter&quot; sockets that rely solely on friction to stay
connected.  John Deere may have made low-tech tractors, but they didn't
want the farmer's spotlight to come unplugged right before he steered
into a ditch!
