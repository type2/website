Subject: Re: [T2] fuel injection guru's needed

&gt; It felt like I was running out of gas, it would idle(just ok), but if I
&gt; tried to give it any accelerator at all it just bogged.  I parked it for
&gt; about and hour and then went back with some gas(I really didn't think that
&gt; was it).  I drove it around the park a little and it did just fine.


Checkfor vacume leaks by spraying water on all the vacume hoses. If the
RPM drops you have a leak.  
I don't think that the 78's had a throttle switch, but if they did, then
check that. Check to ensure that you have proper fuel pressure. Check the
values of the AFM with an ohm-meter.

To check the decel valve (though I doubt this 
is your problme.):
1) Remove large hose connecting valve to intage air sensor.
2) Plug the c0onnection on the intake air side, and start the engine.
3) Run it at 3000 ROM fr a few seconds and then let the throttle go
quickly, while you check for suction at the port on the decel valve.If
there is no suction, replace the decel valve.


-Hope this helps,
