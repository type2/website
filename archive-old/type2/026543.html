&gt;Could anybody tell me where you install a tach on the engine so 
&gt;it can monitor the rpm's.  I have it installed on the dash but since 
&gt;I bought it used there is no instructions with it.  

I'm catching up on my list reading after being gone for 5 days, so if this
has already been answered, forgive me.  Typically, a tach has 4 wires to it
- red, black, green, and white.  If yours is like this, here's what they're
for:  

-&gt; Red goes to 12v switched (meaning it only has power when the ignition is
on).
-&gt; Black goes to ground.
-&gt; Green goes to the negative side of your coil (I'm not sure why one list
member said you need a new coil if you do this, this is where they ALWAYS
hook up).
-&gt; White is for the internal lighting - best to hook this one in with your
dash light dimmer so the light in the tach will dim with the rest of your
instruments, but any switched 12v will do.

Hope this helps.
