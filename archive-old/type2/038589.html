Subject: Re: Help! Stripped screws...

[...]


&gt; I was trying to remove the doors on my '72 Westy. I got 6 out of 8 of the
hex
&gt; head screws loose after soaking in penetrating oil for a few days, but I
&gt; stripped out the head of the top screw on both sides. I was trying to be
&gt; careful - the other screws came loose with a pop, so when these popped, I
&gt; thought, alright! Til I looked and saw the little round hole that use to
be a
&gt; hex. (All of the screws were still in, but loosened a 1 turn, then
tightened
&gt; back up, so I didn't have the weight of the door on the last screws.) What
do
&gt; I do? Am I SOOL?

Don't use an EZ [to break] out.
Is there any hex left in the bottom of the 6mm allen screw?
I use an impact driver with a 6mm allen socket and a BFH. Wail away until it
pops loose. Even rounded ones come loose.
The impact driver at Harbor Freight is good enough. It is one of the few
tools they have that you can beat on and it works. #37530. It is 1/2&quot; drive.
You will need a 1/2 to 3/8 adaptor since most 6mm allen sockets are 3/8
drive.
