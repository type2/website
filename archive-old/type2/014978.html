&gt;One problem is that the battery tray is completely rusted out.  I'm thinking
&gt;of moving the battery to the left side of the engine compartment.

Do not forget the importance of sealing the engine compartment for proper
cooling.  If the battery tray is &quot;completely&quot; rusted out then this hole
could allow a lot of hot air right off the cooling fins to get sucked right
back into the engine.
