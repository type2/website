Hi John,

    Sometimes we can't see the forest for the trees! :-) The trick here is
to not forget our basic tools. A vacuum gauge would have pined this one
right down.        Check all the usual stuff timing, dwell, fuel delivery,
vacuum leaks, etc. then............ With the gauge plugged to manifold vac,
the gauge would read about normal (a little low maybe) at idle.............
Off idle say about 1500 RPM'S, the vacuum reading would start to drop as
usual, then................ as the RPM'S rise the reading would FINALLY
BEGIN TO SHOW PRESSURE!
    Sure sign of a restricted exhaust.      Then with your handy dandy hand
held Laser temp tester......... trace the exhaust until you find the hottest
spot........... this is most likely where your restriction is!
    Some other signs are major blow by, new oil leaks, plus the exhaust
usually has a funny sound (a slight hiss). Engine will run great until you
try to give it throttle.
    See ya!

&gt; drove it without a problem when one plug was
&gt; left out!??? Ran fine with 1 plug not installed. WTF?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;     I vote checking the exhaust system for blockage.
