&gt; Ive never seen this problem posted. 

I posted about it a couple of months ago.

&gt;Im having trouble sealing my valve cover 
&gt;on one side, I first thought I had pushrod tube leaks  but its the valve 
&gt;cover and It pours out.
&gt; The cover is not bent and I have made absolutely sure Ive got a square seal 
&gt;and gasket in place. My next plan is to double up the gasket but b4 I do I 
&gt;was wondering if anyone else has had and rectified my problem.

I tried everything I could think of and eventually had to resort to
silicone sealant.  Finally stopped the leak though.
