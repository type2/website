Subject: Carb crossover pipe

 &gt; This is a '72 dual PDSITs. It does not have the carburetor

Reading this reminded me of a question I have had brewing for a while. Is 
there any advantage in adding a crossover pipe when you have dual weber ict 
carbs? I realise they are connected via the brake booster, which in my case 
(76 Aussie bus) is 11/32 pipe rather than the 15/32 of the US spec. What I 
had in mind was adding a half inch pipe between the manifolds.

Cheers,

Martin
