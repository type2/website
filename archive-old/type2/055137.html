Subject: No Bus Title

&gt; When I bought my camper , it was from some Antique auto dealer and all I
got
&gt; was a bill of sale and no title. He said it wouldn't be a problem. Is
there
&gt; any reason why I would have a problem (like registering it when I get it
all
&gt; fixed up) Why is the title important???

The title is proof of ownership, and is required for tags and registration.
(most states, anyway) It really depends on the state you are in whether you
will have a problem or not.  Also, may depend if the bus had never been
titled before.  My 1st car (many moons ago) had never been titled, and was
always a pain when tags time came around.

I would not wait until you get through with the restoration you are going to
do, in case you have to wait weeks for title to clear.  They may even have
to find the last owner to make sure that bus had not been stolen (worst case
scenario).  Go now to wherever you get your titles (in MS it is the tax
assessor's office) and find out.

Hopefully, the dealer knew what he was talking about, though I think I would
be skeptical of a dealer that didn't apply for your title for you (for a
nominal fee, of course).

A friend of mine recently bought a '57 beetle that had been in a barn for
many years.  He never messed with getting a title, mainly because he knew he
was going to sell it.  When the new owner went for tags, he found out that
the beetle had never been titled, so now he is the proud ORIGINAL owner of a
cherry 1957 beetle.  Funny that it was built two years before he was born!

Hope this helps.
