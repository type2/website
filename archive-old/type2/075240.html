Subject: ATF in pints??

&gt;&gt;Thing I can't figure out: Why don't they sell ATF in pints? You don't add
it
&gt;&gt;by the quart, you add it by the pint but it comes by the quart.

Because they don't have to. Every pint you need means the sale of a quart
for them. Besides, the package probable costs more the fluid, so a pint
wouldn't cost that much less than a quart.
