Subject: Single cab needs good home - Crew cab needs a person with a welder

I'm in the Dallas area.  I bought a 1970 single cab 3 months ago.  I put on
new tires and shocks all around and had the brakes adjusted and a thorough
going over by an excellent ex-dealership mechanic who tweaked everything else.
I am planning to install an A/C, so before I became too attached, I decided to
look for a crew cab.  I bought one in California this last weekend, and it
will be here Tuesday.  If I loved the single, I am in lust with the crew cab.

Alas I now must find a good home for the single.  It has a decent body but
with numerous dings in the cargo bed.  It really was used as a work truck.
Otherwise it mostly has just spotty surface rust in the cargo area and a few
scratches.  The body need a little TLC for the dings in the cargo bed and a
new paint job.  The interior is good, but has upholstery shop seat covers,
head liner, door panels, etc. in grey and black.  They're not SewFine or
authentic but should be durable if you want to leave them as is.  The floor is
solid.  The dash is complete.  The engine is strong and was well maintained by
the PO.  I will advertise it for $4000 to the rabble but would take $3,500
from someone on the list or their friends who would promise it a good home and
give it care for a long future.  I will have photos scanned and available in a
day or two.

Also FYI if someone is interested and ambitious, I also looked at a real rust
bucket crew cab while in the LA area.  It will need the floors front and back,
both rocker panels and at least one sill replaced.  The bed has been replaced
with sheet steel and should be redone.  The cross members looked OK.  The
engine is a just rebuilt 1776.  Owner has invested $1,400 in the engine in the
last few months.  He has the receipts.  It's a good project for someone with a
welder.  The replacement parts are reasonably cheap and available, but it will
take a lot of time.  The owner is a jerk and wants $3,000.  He would not come
down.  If someone wants to spend some time negotiating with the guy and has
time for a good project, it would be a shame to let it go to waste.  Contact
me, and I'll give you his name and phone number.  Like I said, he's a jerk.
I'm listing this for the sake of the crew cab and not for him.
