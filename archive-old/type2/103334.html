Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel injection transplant

Take a look here:
http://users.eastlink_dot_ca/~jarmsworthy/efi%20in%20my%2074.html

should work for a 72 as well.

----- Original Message
&gt; How much of a PITA is it to put a F.I. engine from a
&gt; 79 bus into a 72 bus? How much stuff is associated
&gt; with the FI that would have to be transplanted? How
&gt; easy is it to re-wire the FI engine into the 72 bus?
&gt; Can the FI brain simply be transplanted and connected
&gt; to 12 volts in the 72 bus or is it MUCH more involved
&gt; than that?
