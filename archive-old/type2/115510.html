Subject: Re: Fwd: [T2] Changing from Drums to Disc Brakes

Could not agree more with John.  I have had a half dozen or so customers
needing brakes on busses this year.  Out of those, only 2 really took the
plunge and got everything that was out of speck replaced............new
drums, rotors, etc as needed. The cost for materials and labor on such a job
gets on up there..seems like $500+ on the most recent one, but he now stops
on a dime, and no more pumping etc.......

The other 4 (or could be more) I turned away.  They just wanted new pads or
shoes when I told them there drums/disks were past the wear
limit..............I cannot do work like that.  It is either right, or not
at all.
