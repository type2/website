&lt;&lt; I asked a question similar to this on the diy fuel injecton list and the
answer was negative.  Best deal is to get the injectors cleaned(they do it 
ultrasonically also), and go on...

Cheers, dave &gt;&gt;

Hmmm, I wonder if an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner &quot;box&quot; (filled with injector
cleaner...) would perform the same function ?-) And maybe not only for
injectors but other small parts...
