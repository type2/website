so my  question is am i  too lean according to these ratings? i was 
led to  believe that too low a reading means too lean. and if so, how 
on earth can  that be so considering the high reading on the afm? 
while i get great  acceleration and low head temps with this jet 
combo, mileage is fer crap.  do i go up in main size, and find some 
emulsion tubes that pass more air  at speed???

sounds too rich.   I'd try a smaller main jet.   I have  been able to buy new 
main jets at a motorcycle shop.   I put a new  carb (manual choke 30 pict for 
sp 1600) on my 65 westy, it came with a 120  main, I've gone down to a 112.5  
via 115  cause it was running rich  and the mileage sucked.  Had good power 
though.
