&gt; I've decided to go ahead and give my newest project a fresh rebuild.  This is
&gt; my first time.  I'm about th split case.  This brings me to my question.  I
&gt; noticed that the connecting rods have a lot of play in them.  should they be
&gt; like that? and what is the anticipated amout of movement?

Front to back play (i.e. along the crank) is OK but there should be no
perceptible 'wobble'.  Side clearance spec is 0.004 - 0.016 with a wear
limit of 0.027.  You won't know for sure if all is OK until you take it all
apart, clean, measure and inspect for wear.
