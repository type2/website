Subject: Bus needs a home - or you need spares?

I have a '72 Westy that needs to be properly stripped before I drag it to
the crusher.

All I want from it is the rear and front suspension. 

I need it gone soon. Most everything else is there except the rear seat and
drivetrain. 

It's free. Middle TN. 

Let me know......

Merry Christmas....
