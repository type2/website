&gt; It turned fine when we rebuilt the engine...but seized up last Wednesday
&gt; morning. We pulled the engine and still couldn't turn the crank, so we split
&gt; the case and discovered the front-most main bearing seized solid (which is
&gt; why I asked this question...trying to determine why it would seize after only
&gt; 6,000 miles or so).


I had a VW engine sieze in less than a mile with wrong endplay. very
expensive lesson.
