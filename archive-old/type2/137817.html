&gt; I'm rebuilding my first set of these dual solex carbs and going through the testing procedure two things are puzzling me.

&gt; 1) The accelerator pump is rated for 0.8-1.0cc. The book says you'll expell 10x that much with 10 quick pumps but the rate I can get is 0.7cc pumping it slowly. What does this indicate? If there anything I can do about it?

On carbs in general, not sure on your solex, the pump linkage is
threaded so that you can increase or decrease stroke volume by
changing the length of the link arm.

&gt; 2) The spec for the float is 12-14mm from the top of the lower body. There are no leaks and the valve is working correctly but the best I can achieve is 17-18mm. It's not possible to un-shim the float valve to raise the level. Because of the design of the float chamber, bending the float support doesn't seem possible either. Stumped...

So you are saying you can't use the normal method of bending the float
tab where it contacts the needle? I'm assuming this is what you mean
by you cannot bend the float support.
