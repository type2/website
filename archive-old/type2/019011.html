Re Steve's &quot;thought&quot; of measuring dwell statically using crank rotation:
Muir does have a protocol to measure dwell by crank pulley rotation;
degree wheel not needed, just a good notion of circumference!  Mark the
pulley at the TDC mark, rotate the crank back to starting point; note
how far your mark went!
A meter is still more accurate because it measures during all that
rotation and will account for a worn distributor.
