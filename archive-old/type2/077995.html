Subject: Gas smell after driving

 I'm sending this to both lists because I have a late model gas tank (~71)in my '67 camper. When I rebuilt the bus 5 years ago, I had the tank professionally boiled out and recoated by a radiator shop.
The problem is that I've noticed after driving for a while, like more than 5 minutes, after parking, the bus starts to smell like gas inside the bus. Engine compartment smells fine, but somehow vapors are getting the bus, and it's driving me crazy. I have checked all the fuel lines from the tank to the carb, and everything seems fine, newer lines, rubber in good shape, and not leaking, I can't find any leaks anywhere.
I have noticed that when I stop, I can open the gas cap, and it makes that whooshing sound of de-pressurizing. 
This first happened a couple weeks ago, when I filled up with gas right before going up some very bumpy roads. I thought something might have spilled out, but why would it smell inside the bus and not in the engine compartment?
Argh! Any advice/hints/leads will be greatly appreciated, as this is giving me a headache, in more ways than one.
thanks,
