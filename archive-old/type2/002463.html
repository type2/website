X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL - S

Hi Dan,
I had a similar experience with my 78.  It would run great,
then.......nothing.  It made me so mad that my bus would run like a champ,
then stop like a slug.  I checked everything.  Coil, condensor, vaccum
lines, FI system, even went so far as to trace the ignition wire to make
sure it hadn't corroded.  Nope all tested out ok.  What the *&amp;^#, I would
mutter to myself.  Then on a whim I decided to change my points, condensor
cap and rotor when I discovered the culprit.  In my distributor I found the
male connector that connects the condensor to the points had sliiped out of
its bracket slightly (damn rubber parts) and was on large bumbs or tight
turns moving over and touching the point wire to the rotor shaft.  Poof
there's my short........I replaced all ignition parts and clamped the
condensor male down on the outside of the distributor per Bentley.   No
problems related since.

Hope this solves your mystery problem.....

Isaiah Smith
78 Champy
