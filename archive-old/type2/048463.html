Subject: [T2] Great Deal?

Forgive me, Volks, for I have sinned.  ;-(  

I popped the clutch in gear in my carport and went right into an
overhead storage cabinet.  Put a damned nice crease in my (well,
Sally's) nose, right above the grille, jamming the wiper assemblies in
enough to crack the windshield on the passenger side.

I went yesterday to talk to a body shop in Willow Glen - &quot;AllVW&quot; - Auto
German on Lonus.  David said for a grand total of $3500 he would do ALL
needed to make Sally perfect on the outside.  This would include:

* All body work (there are a few other fairly minor dings on her in
addition to the nose job)
* Straighten and paint bumpers (rear is a bit dinged, he'll work on that
or if he can find one in better shape, use that)
* Blast and paint the hubcaps the same white as the bumpers.  (Yes, I
want white hubcaps, I know not why.)
* Make the wheels look brand new.
* Make the wiper arms look brand new, and fix the crunched wipers,
whatever that takes.
* Windshield and rubber.
* 2 coats of new Sierra Yellow.

I looked at a few vehicles that had just been painted, and they looked
great - very little overspray and looks like they do a great job of
detailing after.  Apparently they do all the prep there and then send
'em somewhere else to paint...  2-3 weeks in the shop.  I liked the fact
that it is an all VW shop, he was willing to throw in all the stuff I
want done - got the feeling he'll work with ya.

Anyone ever heard of/dealt with this shop?  Is this a good deal?  (for
Silicon Valley)  No clear coat - do I care?  Are there questions I
should pose before I make a final decision?  I asked him about prep -
sounded pretty good to me, but I know nothing of body work/paint.  Any
paints to stay clear of?  Anything I've forgotten?

I've been fantasizing about complete paint and body work anyway, so I'm
taking the high road and looking at this as an opportunity to make it
so!

Thankee mightily!

Teri
