Subject: Body Shop recommendations

Hey there bussers:

I live in Costa Mesa, CA and I have a 69 Westy I'm currently 
restoring.   When I bought the bus, there was serious damage to the sheet 
metal on the nose skin of the bus.   My dad and I bought a new front end 
from another bus (thankfully in great shape) and need to have the work done 
to cut off the old and install the new.   Can anyone give any 
recommendations for a great body shop close to Costa Mesa that understands 
buses?   I've tried Mesa West German Auto and West Coast Classic 
Restoration, but they are pretty much booked for the near future.   If 
anyone has had good experience with a local shop, please drop me a private 
mail.   Thanks!

Jason
