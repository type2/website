Subject: Re:79 oil leak

I've had persistent low grade oil leaks  from my oil pump on my '78 
Westfalia. The oil dribbles down and drips off the two bolts protruding 
from the bottom of the rear engine support bar. It blows around enough 
that it's hard to tell just where it's coming from. I apparently bent the 
flange on the oil pump once while removing it inelegantly (i.e. prying 
with a screwdriver rather than a puller or simply splitting the case to 
liberate it). But I replaced the pump with a good used one and still had 
strouble with leaks through the holes for the 4 mounting bolts on the oil 
pump. They have washers with little teflon seals on them that can 
evidently crack and leak. Even my new oil pump leaks a bit. I've rebuilt 
my engine several times and never quite gotten this little leak 100% 
under control. I imagine using some soft gasket sealant liberally on the 
bolts or in the holes next time. 

Once the engine is in it's a super duper PITA to get at these bolts. This 
is definitely in the class of things to fix while the engine's out.

If only one bolt hole were leaking the drip would seem to come from one 
side or the other (the right side, in your case).

Oil leaks can be tough to localize, but this is one more point of 
entry to consider. 

Your actual mileage may vary. 

Good luck,
