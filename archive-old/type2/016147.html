Hello all!

     OK, We put a afm off of a 78, and 79 bus on and still not running,
we put different relays, computer brain,  coil, distributor, points and
condenser, checked all wiring connections, fuel pump _at_ 35psi, and spark
plugs. nothing works. It still won't run. 
     Ok here's the story again was running great friday then it just
stalled with no warning. it will sorta start, meaning it will go
put-put, with the gas pedal floored, but as soon as you let go of the
key it stops.
     So does anyone else have any idea's?? Again 79 bus 2.0l FI
Pertronix ignitor, other wise stock, less tan 9,00 miles since rebuild. 
     If I didn't love her so much I'd shoot her! 

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
