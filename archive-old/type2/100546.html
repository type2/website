Subject: What mirror is this? &amp; stuff FS

Greetings list,

I got some stuff for sale over at thesamba but I am wondering what car this 
side mirror goes to?

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/index.mv?photo+200212291447573027

click the mirror photo at the bottom. Does this go to an early bus?

Have a spare tire mount and some sagegreen (76-79) doors for sale too. No 
rust but need some work cheap.

Sliding window for a sliding door too.

open to trades see ad for wish list.

Thanks,
Brandt
78 Sagegreen Westfalia
79 Sagegreen Westfalia
