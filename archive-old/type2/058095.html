OK it's Friday - heres a vague related question
I've never tried a Friday thing before so be nice to me please

I read in a recent posting that Ron (I think) was selling a bus driven accross
from the west coast by a ozzy.

I am English and the idea of driving from west to east across the US appeals
to me, is this sensible? Could I buy a bus on the West coast and expect to be
able to sell it again on the East?

I guess I would be taking about 5 weeks driving accross. (I did it the other
way in '86 in a Mazda 323 driveaway in 5 days! - we did Niagara to Las vagas
in 36 hours solid).  Comments ( nice ones) on Pmail please as I am on Digest -
thanks
