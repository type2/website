Subject: Source for cylinder shims

I am looking for a source for cylinder base shims (spacers).  These are 
the shims that go between the base of the cylinder and the engine case. 
  Bus Depot lists only thicknesses of .010&quot;, .020&quot;, .030&quot;, .040&quot;, .060&quot;, 
and .090&quot;.  By my calculations, I would need about .070&quot; to get the 
compression ratio that I want (7.0)

Can anyone recommend another source for these shim/spacers?

Thanks

Tim
