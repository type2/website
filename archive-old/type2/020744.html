Subject: oil plug

So...  Armed with all the little goodies I would need, I went to change
my oil and durn it, the oil plug just don't want to move.

Left is loose and right is tight here, right???

As both Muir and Bentley state this is should only be torqued to 9 ft
lb.

Should I get my bruteful neighbor to give this a try?  Mayhap a few
judicious whacks with a mallet or worse?

Thanks, doodz and doodettes!

Teri
