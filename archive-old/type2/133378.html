&gt; I am currently on a road trip from Seattle to Southern Utah. I arrived in St.
&gt; George, UT this morning to come to a realization that I cannot change gears
&gt; (manual) from 2nd to 3rd. The only gears I can use now are 2 and 4. I had to
&gt; have the '80 Vanagon towed to a Texaco station because no other mechanics were
&gt; open. So I am stranded here for the weekend at the least.
&gt; The mechanic crawled under and came to the conclusion that the problem is
&gt; transmission. Does anybody have any other suggestions that I could bring up to
&gt; another mechanic on monday? Thanks in advance. It would be much appreciated
&gt; for any advice.


sounds like linkage, others have told you how to adjust, but you should be
able to drive it using just 2 &amp; 4th if you are carefull.  takes a real
delicate touch on the clutch but it will work enough to nurse you
home....might be REALLLLLL slow on some of the hills and try not to stop
facing uphill if you can but otherwise you could make it...get on the
interstate get up to 55 and just keep on going and going and going

much easier to fix and less stress in your own driveway
