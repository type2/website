Subject: rain!

Wet-climate kombiites, i feel your pain...

We're in a drought out here in the west, but Northern
Utah's finally getting a good fall soaking.

my bus exhibited several moisture-related problems on
start up this morning. Besides a wet seat, annoying
electrical glitches have cropped up, including my turn
signal indicators going on by themselves! 

time to readjust the ol' auto-choke and clean and
replace all the wiring/fuses i can reach.
