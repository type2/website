out there that want to share in parting out a '78 Westy?? yours, mine,
or a friend's who's not at home !?!?!? Seriously, I am considering
acquiring another '78 Westy that may be in better shape, body rust wise,
than my current '78 Westy, and I would like to rework the new '78s body
with a fresh paint job and then swap all my good '78 parts into the
re-done '78. My current '78 has a busted right front door, and bunches
of rust holes, but I would probably come out of this with much extra
parts, along with the extra parts I already have ( 1 and 1/2 spare 2000
engines plus one reworked 2000 engine; progressive carbs for the type 4
with manifolds; pop top and things; Westy interior(s); glass and more
glass!!) While I am trying to keep the herd down to one, there are/will
be extras to be had... But I would like someone to share some expenses
and rewards. My last donation of 10 tires/rims went well, but that was
to someone on thesamba. -- Anymouse sends
