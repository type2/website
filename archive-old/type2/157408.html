I have a 77 hardtop westy, factory white in color, 
 
the paint is old and faded , so I would like to freshen it up a bit. 
 
I can sand it down and take some of the things off that might get overspray, 
 
I am hoping to get it sprayed , same color for about $500 , 
at least thats what the ads for Maaco , one day and Earl schieb say, 
 
Anything else I shoiuld do ?
 
thanks for your advise
 
Dave
