List,
This post is really just to see if the list is up.
My rebuild is turnkey on the bench minus new intake boots and a few other
rubber parts coming in from busboys - including new balljoint boots.
The frontend is in a box in the back seat of my car.

Thinking of high-heat siliconing all of the cooling tin joints.
Might blast and paint the tin, but really ain't too worried about how pretty
it is.

Should be ready to hit a local VW show (KAVW in louisville, Ky) on 22 April.

I've come a long way since 98 when i trashed the engine in the 75 auto bus
running it up and down the road without the vac line to the tranny hooked up. 
Accelerating, It'd shift up to third and when i let off the gas, it would drop
back to second and the rpms would go through the stratosphere.
Dropped the #4 intake seat and melted the port. Sound like an &quot;I-D-TEN_TEE&quot;
error, eh?

I have learned so much - with much to go.

...and the beat goes on.
