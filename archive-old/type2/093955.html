Subject: '73 transmission linkage and axles

I am looking for someone in the southeastern CT area who wants to sell a
pair of axles, shifter and linkage, clutch cable tube, and flywheel.
It needs to fit a 1700cc 73 bay

I am putting a 4spd in where there was an automatic.  I have a local
junkyard but the few bays thatv are left are pretty sunk in the mud and its
a bear to get underneath.
