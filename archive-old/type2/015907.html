Hello all,

 I thought I'd put in to my $.02 worth about the cooling flap issue. I
bought my bus 1 1/2 years ago and last summer, noticed that the engine ran
hot. After consulting the list, I found out that there was no flaps in my
type4. I found a set up from a FLAP and installed it in. I noticed that the
bus seemed to run cooler, so I truly believe that they do direct more
airflow over the oil cooler than without.

 On a diffrent subject, is there anyone from N. Texas/ Oklahoma going to
the Buses on 66?? I'm leaving OKC about noon on Friday and wanted to
caravan with someone. E-mail me so I can make arrangements please!!!
