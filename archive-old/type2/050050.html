Subject: [T2] Thanks, and...

Many thanks to Sean, Britt, Oldschoolvw, Tom Young, Tarheel and Karl for
input on my bus problems, eh, challenges...

And, anyone ever tried to jbweld or do some other trick thing to
permanently attach the instrument panel clips to the dash?

Looks to me like it'd be a bear to try and do it with the clips, but
maybe a small piece of aluminum (will jbweld stick to this?  something
else I don't know) or other metal tapped for the screw?

I am NOT looking forward to trying to get this back together!  My arms
need to be 3 feet longer and MUCH more flexible...  ;-)

Teri
