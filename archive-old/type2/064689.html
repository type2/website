Subject: Trip Report: Border partings  :-(

Hey now,
     Our fresh start was pretty sour.
     Yesterday (20 July) actually went quite well, Todd &amp; Becky were
excellent company for breakfast, and let me do a valve adj. and oil change in
thier yard. So things went ok.
     Which brings us to the real downer. 
     Canadian Customs. 
     In a nutshell, they denied us entry. Of course, this was after they
ransacked the bus and treated us like criminals. When they found out we were
headed for Inuvik, they decided that $400 was not enough cash to get us
there. And that they didn't like Samantha's very old criminal record. LSD
when she was 18, 11 years ago. Hasn't touched the stuff in years. Should've
thought about that, and cleared it up, but we'd always heard that Canadian
crossings were more formality than anything else. I'm used to Mexico, where
they wave you on through. So, they said no. 
     Said we needed about $500 more, and we'd have to go to the consulate in
Seattle-monday AM. That's a little late for the trip. We headed south to get
a motel and lick our wounds. I went in to talk rates and the woman said that
sometimes folks just go over to the other border and go right on through. So
we tried.
     Bad, BAD move. We are very, very lucky. Canadian customs could have
taken our bus, and put is in the holding cell 'till monday, and it could've
cost thousands to get out. Fortunately for us, we told them before they found
out that we were hoping for a better judgement. They let us go. The American
Customs fellows told us that they'd never seen that happen, normally we'd
have gone to the hoosegow. No es muy bueno.
     And along comes 21 July. We're supposed to be at Tobin's already, and
instead we're on the wrong side of the border with 2 major problems. Money
was easily solved, Sam's problem not so simple. I made the decision to not go
on the trip. My feeling was one for all, all for one, we don't go. 
     Samantha is an angel. She knows what this trip means to me, how much
planning I've put into it, how much sweat I poured out in Texas to ready our
bus for the journey. She told me to go.
     I intitally said no. She harrased me for about 3 hours this morning, and
finally convinced me. A couple of months ago, she was thinking about flying
home from Portland and letting me continue on to Inuvik, but I convinced her
to join me. I really wanted this to be a joint affair, and something we could
remember as a couple for life. She was never truly invested in the trip, and
it was always something she was doing for me more than anything else. So when
customs said no, she sent me off on my own. I'm still not sure it was the
best decision, but it's done now, what will be will be. 
     We got Sam down to Seattle-Tacoma airport this afternoon, and she was in
Los Angeles at 6:10 tonight. And I mostly felt like crap as we drove North.
     Indra (the dog) helped comfort me on the drive north from Seattle. She's
my link to Samantha, and will likely be spoiled even more as we go north, as
I miss Sam and give Indra love instead. 
     Tobin drove out and met us at the border to help us get across, and we
followed him into Vancouver. My dad and I both really enjoyed his CB tour of
Vancouver as we went, but I still felt like the bus was empty. This whole
adventure has become bittersweet, and I don't really know how I'll feel as it
goes on. Things seem normal, and then I see a sunset, and I think of Sam,
2000 miles away, and remember that she's supposed to be beside me. 
     Tobin and Christa were wonderful to both of us, not only assisting in
our entry, but in being kind and hospitable to us upon our arrival.  Everyone
here seems to feel really bad about Sam's treatment, but that doesn't make
much difference. She's still shut out.
     Sam has flown south to resolve this problem, as she has a trip planned
to the UK later this year, and will rejoin me on the 12th at Seattle. 
     So it is with mixed emotions I view the upcoming excursion. One side is
ready for the trip, the other will likely be unfullfilled until the 12th. I
hope that I can get past this to enjoy the trip, if I spend all my time
thinking of Sam, no-one wins.  We will tour Yellowstone and the Rockies when
this is all over, so there's still more to come. It's not over yet...
Peace,
Eddie
