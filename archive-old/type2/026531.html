&gt;Also, here in the 'Warm California Sun' the local Bus guy says to 
&gt;remove both air flaps that are controlled by the bellows...we have very 
&gt;little freezing weather down here in the low lands, and removing the 
&gt;'flaps' should allow for improved cooling thru the oil cooler - right...?

NOOOO!  Don't do it!!!  The flap on the left-hand side is curved in such a
way as to divert some of the air flow directly across the oil cooler.  If
you remove it, you'll get LESS air across your stock oil cooler, not more.
This is not fiction, speculation, or hear-say.  This is a fact.  

If you don't believe me, put the fan housing, flaps, and all the tin back on
with the exception of the 2 large cylinder covers and play with the flaps to
see how they work (and how the curved flap lays down on the tin piece that
sits on top of the oil cooler to create a direct path for the air).

What you DO want to do while you've got your engine apart is to make sure
that both flaps will open all the way.  That rod that connects them can get
bent/twisted through abuse (it's really NOT a handle to lift the engine
with) and can actually prevent one or the other (usually the non-oil cooler
side) from opening all the way. 

If you're bound and determined that you don't need the thermostat, just make
sure the spring is in place on the rod and it will keep the flaps in the
full open position.  But do yourself a favor and don't remove the flaps.

&gt;I am also going to S*** Can the covers and ducts around the heater 
&gt;boxes, as well as plugging the blower outlets to same, and the 
&gt;electric blower ducts...here hoping this increased air flow will help 
&gt;keep some of the cracks out of the 'new' heads...

This is another really bad idea unless you are running pipes with no heat
exchanger boxes.  If you leave the heat exchangers on, you must have air
flow through them or you'll burn your exhaust valves.  The system is
designed to always have cooling air moving through the boxes which in turn
cools the exhaust manifolds where they attach to the heads.  Without the air
flow in the boxes, the pipes will get too hot and your valves will suffer as
they pull the super-heated gases back in during the valve overlap period.
That's why the heat control boxes have an exhaust cap on them instead of
just sealing shut when you're not using the heater.  Again, this is fact,
not fiction.
