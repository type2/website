&gt; I've got some questions that're likely to stir up some debate. (I know
&gt; you've all been waiting for something since the Bus Depot Wars seem to be
&gt; over! ;-} ) I've the Muir book and at first I thought it was great. But I've
&gt; been dredging through the archives and now I'm beginning to wonder. I have
&gt; subjects that are bothering me and I'd like some opinions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Timing. Muir says static timing is the best but I've read/heard alot
&gt; of dissent.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Distributors. Muir says mechanical (009) is best. My problem here is
&gt; my bus has a 009 and I thought I was lucky that the PO had already put one
&gt; in for me. Now I'm beginning to wonder.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Warming up. Muir says warm up before you drive. Others disagree.
&gt; 
&gt; The book seems to be a great how-to guide for the various repairs discussed
&gt; but I'm beginning to think that the things that are Muir's opinion need to
&gt; be taken with a grain (or two) of salt. what's the verdict?

Never, never, never use Muir in isolation, but always have Muir and Bentley
on hand when you work on your Bus (until you've memorized Muir) for these
reasons, and many more:

* Muir knows you don't have VW Special Tool 123 456 789, the Inside Left CV
Joint Scrub Brush, or VW Special Tool 987 654 321, the Brake Drum End Play
Measuring Frammis. Bentley, being an exact copy of the VW Dealership
Mechanic's Manual, assumes everyone with their book has those items hanging
up on the wall ready to use.

* Muir didn't have to contend with Smog Nazis, nor with the great decline in
companies making parts for these cars. IIRC, Muir died in 1977, when both
the Loaf and the Bug were available with factory price stickers in the
windows. Go to &quot;How to buy a Volkswagen&quot; in Muir and you will find the
sentence, &quot;I have no advice for those of you buying a new one.&quot; These days,
a &quot;new one&quot; is OT for this list.

* Muir also didn't have the luxury of modern offshore manufacturing. How
much was a stroboscopic timing light in Muir's day? A lot higher than the
$19.95 I paid for one at Wal-Mart a couple of years back. Add to that the
wage scales of the time and a $50 timing light got real expensive real fast.
However, Muir did have parts availability in places that wouldn't dream of
carrying ACVW parts now; in the 1970s I could get &quot;complete tune-up kits&quot;
for a VW Bug or Bus, all sealed in a blister card, at any K-mart in America.
But once again, VW still sold new ACVWs in the United States.
