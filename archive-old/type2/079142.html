&gt; Based on the collective responses - I'm going to go after the fuel

My tank on the inside is in really bad shape from prior neglect.  I'd become
tired of replacing the filter so I installed a filter I could clean and a
valve that lets me shut off the supply of gas while I clean it.  Only a
little dribbles out after you close the valve.

This has made the best of the situation until I get the tank cleaned or
replaced.  Replacing the real filter was expensive and messy.  I used to
have to clean it out a lot but the last large trip I went on (3,000 miles)
only needed one cleaning.

It's amazing how few rust particles it takes to choke it.
