Subject: &lt;Q&gt;Weber Cams and Products&gt;&gt;still in business?

Does anyone know if Weber Cams and Products in Costa Mesa CA (not to be
confused with Web Cam) is still around?  I wanted to get a set of VW typeIV
hyd. lifters and a BMW big six cam from them.  I have their catolog from a
few years back and called the number.  Instead of getting Weber I got a lady
who was not overly pleased about *another* call for this company.  She was
pretty sure that Weber had gone out of business.  Can anyone verify this?

TIA,
