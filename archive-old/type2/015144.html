Subject: FS-'71 Westy--Helga
Mime-Version: 1.0

Nice to be back on the list:  I've got a really nice running (and looking)
Westfalia for sale for $2,550.   '71 WF, strong rebuilt '69 motor (no
leaks, no fumes!), shiny paint on a straight body (beige over navy
two-tone), new brakes, shocks, steering, new canvas on top, child's cot.
The shortcomings; medium interior, front seats worn out, some headliner
sag, naugahyde on mattress, no canvas on upper cot, no radio, no appliances
(I've actually liked it better with a Coleman stove and cooler; you can
move them around when you need to fill the bus with bikes and stuff).

I drive this bus almost every day with no problems:  It starts on the first
crank, steers great, stops great, looks great, camps wonderfully, and has
no rust.  It's a non-original color scheme--I use it for driving and
camping, not showing--but if you wanted to spiff up the interior and paint,
it could be a show bus.  You can e-mail me at 1trader_at_airmail_dot_net, or if
you're pretty serious, call me at 817-882-9986.  If you're serious enough
that you have cash in hand, the price is negotiable.  It's in Fort Worth, TX.

Sam Shimek
