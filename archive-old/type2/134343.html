&gt; &gt; Regarding the top engine bay hatch, has anyone added a cut-out from a
73-9
&gt; &gt; to a 72? Experiences? Was it worth it?  Thanks, Chris

Hello Chris,

My '78 westy had a standard engine bay hatch. I got a metal engine bay hatch
from a vanagon. I measured the space between the two frames in the engine
bay, cut the hatch to appropriate size and welded it. I smoothened the
cut-out with vice-grips and adapted a seal from a vanagon sliding door. Then
I added two hinges for the hatch and now I've got plenty of room to work on
the engine from above.
