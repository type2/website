&gt; Hey everybody, happy Friday.
&gt;
&gt; Every couple of days I see a fella driving by in his 68-70 bus with his
&gt; engine compartment door off (meaning not just open, but not there).  I
&gt; only get a quick look as he speeds by, but his engine looks like the
&gt; same single port 1600-ish engine I've got.  Is there any good, possible
&gt; reason for him not to have the engine bay door?  Just wondering in case
&gt; I ever meet up with him...

Not a good idea.  All that warm air coming out from under the engine
recirulates through the opening.  There was a good reason that VW put a
seal on that door!
