Subject: Fuel vents and charcoal canister

Hello. When I was a young stupid freshman, I tore all of the fuel 
vent/charcoal canister tubing out of the engine compartment from the top 
vents of the gastank in my 1973 bus. This is a carburated engine, so I 
figured that it wouldn't matter. The bus hasn't had an engine in it since 
then, but the time may be near. After consulting some people, I decided 
that I needed that system, so this is what I did: I ran a fuel line 
from each of the two vent tubes in the top of the gas tank. These fuel 
lines come together in a T fitting and run to a spare piece of the 
original I found, through the wall, along the original path and to a remaining 
piece of original tubing which runs up the left vent wing and back 
down. At this point, the path ends. Was there a reason VW ran the system 
through both vent wings? Do I still need to run this vent through the 
charcoal canister or can I cut it off near the top of the vent wing? What 
ill effects could this replacement system promote? Where do I go from
 here? Thank you.
