Subject: Two tone color kombis for Kombi

	 Hi list!

	Is there anybody out there with a two tone colured bus where one of the
colors is light grey ( nr 345 I think)
I´m doing some rustoration and it would be fun to get another colour on the
lower part of the bus. Still with an original VW tone of course.
