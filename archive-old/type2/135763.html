Subject: Re: [T2] Worst Passes

While this certainly isn't close to what I expect to see on the way to
Denver, I got a taste for how the bus will do on a pass yesterday.

Drove out to Santa Monica to pick up a 69 Westy tent (Yay!!!). Decided
to swing by NoHo and visit my brother-in-law. From the 405 my wife
said to take the 101 North. So I made it up and over the pass there
before she realized we were heading in the wrong direction and needed
the 101 South. She sucks at navigation.

So I went over that pass again. 

I made it in 4th at 55mph and still had pedal. So I'm pretty
comfortable at GWB's climbing abilities.

=D
