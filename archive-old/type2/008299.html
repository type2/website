Subject: Fuel tank ventilation
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 1999 10:57:57 -0800

Hi Type 2 folks,
            Does anyone have any opinions about the fuel tank ventilation
system on 2.0 FI engines?  I had to check my Bentley manual to find out
just what this thing is, and what the vent lines are.  I've noticed that
the vent line that runs above the engine near the fan motor has a rubber
&quot;T&quot; in it where another line then runs forward to the charcoal filter. 
This rubber T on my bus has been broken in two for a while now, and I
haven't really known what repercussions this could have. ( My education
is still coming along.)  Can someone tell me if 1: this rubber inline T
part is available from VW or aftermarket.....and 2:  is this a somewhat
critical part of my fuel tank system, should I get it hooked back up
ASAP, or am I not to worry, as I have not asphyxiated or blown myself up
yet?

                                       Thanks,  Kevin  Snow

the ride*
