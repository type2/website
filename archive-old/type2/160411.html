Subject: 8 mpg(!!!)

My '79 Cali is running great, but is getting terrible (8-sh) mpg. I know
there are a litany of things that might be the cause of this, but I'm
wondering where to even start diagnosing. What is the most likely culprit?

The bus has been firing up fine, even in very cold weather, and idles as it
should. Occasionally it will &quot;miss&quot; on cold start for a few minutes; meaning
that if it's revved after cold start it sounds like it's down a cylinder.
After warmup, however, the bus runs great and is smooth through the RPM
range.

However, the exhaust is quite fumy and it's pretty evident that the mixture
is off. Some black smoke is present when the motor is revved, but nothing
severe. The inside of the tailpipe is black and sooty, and the plugs show
even amounts of soot. Obviously, something ain't right.

So, should I dive right into jacking with the AFM? Could the O2 sensor or a
leaky coldstart valve cause this much grief? I'm afraid to start poking
around too much, just because it's my daily driver it's running so well
otherwise. Any practical advice is much appreciated.
