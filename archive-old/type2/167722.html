&gt; round of adjustments on the valves, so I rotated the engine, at the pulley

&gt; watch the  number two piston. Its at the top, so I rotate it down to the
&gt; bottom and back up to the top, and it locks up hard. Solid. Will not turn.
&gt; Guess that is 180 degrees of the crank rotation.
&gt;
&gt; Turn it back around the other way, watch the number two piston for a
&gt; reference, and it goes down, comes up, and locks up hard. Not compression
&gt; hard. Rock solid hard.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't touch the left side of the motor, still even has all the tin on it,
&gt; so with the right head off. I believe I have checked all the stupid things
&gt; that could have happened, and I have no clue.

the problem is probably on the left side, pull that head. sounds a lot
like a dropped valve seat..

good luck.

&gt; Bummed doesn't begin to describe it....

we've all been there. not a fun place
