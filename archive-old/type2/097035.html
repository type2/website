Subject: Crashed my bus....

Howdy folks!

I was on the list a few years ago, then changed addresses and have been
lurking in read only mode since...

About an hour after finishing replaing the ball joints on my 71 Westy, I got
into a crash.  The wreck was the other drivers fault, she admitted it and
there were lots of witnesses.  Anyway, just wondering how much this is going
to cost to repair, if its worth it, tips for dealing with the insurance
adjuster, etc?  I've posted some photos at http://bcmiller.cjb_dot_net/bus.html
Thanks for your feedback!

Brian
