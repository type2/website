Subject: Wheel adapters - '70's bolt pattern onto a '74 westy

I recently purchased some wheels without thinking about one thing, the bolt
pattern may be different.....OOOPS!  and that is just what happened.  It
appears that the bolt pattern I have will fit a 1970 Bus but, as I know there
was a change to a more narrow pattern.  Is there an adapter to allow me to go
to the larger pattern??  I believe I'm going from a 114.3mm pattern to a
203.2mm pattern..

any help will be greatly appreciated,.
