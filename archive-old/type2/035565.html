Subject: Re: heater boxes?

You could do it the way cyclists test inner tubes (sort of):  plug both
ends, run (air even your breath will do, but compressed air is better) into
it and dunk it under water.  Air bubbles will reveal the leakes real fast.
I suspect that even a primo box will leak a lot of air pretty fast under
that condition.  I wonder if you could just dust the h*ll out of the
exterior and blow fresh air into it with a hair dryer (or compressor).  I
bet the talcum powder would be easy to spot getting blown away from the
leaky holes.

&gt;I have just removed the heaters boxes off my spare 1600 and want to know if
&gt;anybody on the list knows of a way to test them for leaks?
