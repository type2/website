Fellow oil changers,

replacing windshield on a 71 westy *not mine* don't want to replace the
front skin! not able to weld in new pieces to cover some holes * size of
silver dollar*  planning to grind it down as best we can to bare metal,
paint with *permatex extend*, cover with *fiber-glass*  bondo and install
the new windshield.  Has anyone used this * Extend* stuff, does it really
work to help stop the spread of the rust, that's living * very healthy* in
this bus.
