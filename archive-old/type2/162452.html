&gt; &gt;If ignition is retarded, temperatures go up.  However, if the
&gt; &gt;engine is tuned to run on low-octane fuel without pre-ignition, then there
&gt; &gt;is no advantage to using high-octane fuel.  For example, my Mexican engine
&gt; &gt;wouldn't knock if I ran it on tequila!
&gt;
&gt; Our engines are designed to run on 87 but it seems that running an aircooled engine at sea level and climbing the hills at altitude cause it to run at vastly different termperatures compared to a modern watercooled engine.

over a number of years of testing and checking I find that I need to run
89 Octane in my 78, why ??? but on 87 it will knock on hills under load.
maybe when engine was rebuilt (it was supposed to be stock) it got a
little higher CR, maybe some carbon build up, maybe the auto tranny puts
more load???

not sure why but know for sure to put 89 in it or shudder ever time it
knocks...

YMMV
