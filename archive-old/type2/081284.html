Early Dodge trucks did it. Oil pressure was wired to the fuel pump so as to
keep drivers from running out of oil.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering about whether it is possible to use the
&gt; oil pressure switch as a means for cutting out the points
&gt; and saving the engine if/when the oil pressure disappears ...
&gt;
&gt; Here's my theory ... add a wire from the pressure switch
&gt; to the live side of the points (at the coil say). When
&gt; the oil pressure is nil, the switch is closed and the points
&gt; are effectively shorted out, so no spark, no load on the
&gt; motor, etc. And when you start up in the morning, she won't
&gt; fire until the oil pressure is up, which only takes a second
&gt; or two anyhows. That's gotta be good, right?
&gt;
&gt; The drawbacks as far as I can figger are that
&gt; (a) the idiot light will probably glow while you drive (brightness
&gt; will be proportional to the dwell angle of the points),
&gt; (b) the back-voltage from the coil/points might fry the idiot light, and
&gt; (c) the coil might overheat if you leave the ignition on when
&gt; the motor isn't running (but you got this risk anyway if the points
&gt; happen to be closed when the motor stops)
&gt;
&gt; The first two problems can probably be overcome by strategically placing a
&gt; high-voltage diode in series with the wire from the oil switch
&gt; to the points.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone ever tried this? Will it work?
&gt;
