Subject: Oil fill tube leaking.

Hi everybody.

The Denmeister dropped by my place the other day, and pointed out that
oil full tube, the plastic one that connects to the elbow to the
crankcase was loose.  That is the main reason why I am having such
terrible oil weeping.  The fan is sucking the oil right out of the
crankcase and blasting it everywhere!  I pulled it out today, cleaned
everything, including the fan cover and the entire general vicinity!

I took it for a test test but lo and behold, oil is still seeping up,
and I can still pull the fill tube out with little effort.  I think that
the bottom flange is shot, and when I tighten the retaining bolt, it is
just spreading it out, making it loose.

Do you think I can use a clamp on it instead?  One of those self
tightening circle clamps with a nut that you use to tighten?

Thanks again!
Eric.
