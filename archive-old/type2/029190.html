&gt;the fact that they are still around for us to worry with them is because
&gt;VW did build em that way.

My very first experience with VWs was when I was 15 my 18 year old brother
talked me into buying half of a rusted out 75 Bug. With a total investment
of $50 our intent was to make it a &quot;Baja Bug&quot; and drive it off road on a
network of old logging roads which were maintained for use as snowmobile
trails. We &quot;prepped&quot; that poor bug by beating off the fenders with a
sledgehammer, removing all the windows and finding 2 more snow tires on a
VW bug at the dump. When the front seats fell through the rusted floor
while we were jumping it in a sandpit, we used steel cable to attach a
piece of plywood underneath. We drove it ALL summer on those dirt roads 2-3
times a week. We decided (for safety sake) we would not use anything higher
then 2nd gear so we wouldn't go too fast, so our driving technique was to
go as fast as we could in 2nd (35-40mph feels plenty fast with no
windshield) and lift the throttle going into corners to get the back end
out. One night we were out there and the oil light came on. We stopped and
discovered we had lost a valve cover. So we dumped in our 1 spare quart of
oil and drove back, making it the last couple hundred yards with the oil
light on. A quick run to the dump for another valve cover, fill it up with
oil (it's only oil change while we owned it) and we were good for the rest
of the summer.

Since it wasn't road legal we left it out on the trails and over the winter
it was vandalized even worse then we had done. It still left a lasting
impression on my brother and me, he owns a very nice 65 camper and I have
my 78 camper. We kept on buying/getting free rusted out cars (I have some
fond memories of a 76 Eldorado that only had 1st gear) and driving them out
there until the landowner put up locked gates. The ONLY vehicle to last
more then a couple weeks was the VW and one time it had to tow back a 70s
Buick that we had been &quot;racing&quot;.

Point? oh yeah my point is I agree with Bob, VWs are simple and dependable
machines that take a tremendous amount of abuse without serious problems
