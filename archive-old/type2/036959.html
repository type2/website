Sami-
         You answered your own question about the replacement of oil-bath 
cleaners with
costly paper element filters. Costly to the owners because of endless 
replacements,
but cheaper for the manufacturer- they only buy one and their cost is much 
less than
the oil set-up. As &quot;Engine Charlie&quot; said, &quot;Parts left out cost nothing and 
are not covered by the warrantee...&quot; The extreme of that (although in a 
weight-saving situation, rather than cost), was Colin Chapman, who ran a 
prototype Lotus on a test
track and kept removing sections of the monocoque chassis until it collapsed. 
He re-
placed that section and declared the chassis light/strong enough...
