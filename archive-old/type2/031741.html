&gt; the lower &quot;cooling tin&quot; is there to RESTRICT the flow of air. Without it, a

I'm not talking about the little piece that fits between the cyl above the
pushrod tubes.

I have removed the heat exchangers, ie but &quot;J&quot; pipes on a 2 liter
engine...of course the lower channel that ducts air over the thermostat is
above the plate between the heat exchanger and pushrod tubes... so in my
case the slipstream of air flows over the thermostat.  the cooling air is
ducted straight down into the slipstream AFTER going through all of the
cyl tin 

hope that is more understandable
