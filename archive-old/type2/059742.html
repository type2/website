Subject: Canadians and J.C. Whitney

Does anyone know how to e-mail J.C. Whitney from Canada?  Their web-site
mentions that &quot;orders from Canada not available by e-mail yet...&quot; but also,
I used their &quot;Contact Us&quot; link, and only got bounced e-mails back
&quot;Undeliverable&quot; etc.

Maybe it's fax time.... or talking drums, or smoke signals......
