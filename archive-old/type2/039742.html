Conscious driving at a reasonable speed allows for the occasional sip of some 
hot or cold beverage [non-alcoholic] and gives you time to watch all those 
people speeding by while putting on make-up, eating, drinking, talking on the 
phone, reading, changing clothes,having sex, switching drivers, or sleeping. 
And I've seen all that and more while driving my bus around.  I have used a 
roll of duct tape, a paint tray, a hump caddy, or my knees to hold my go cup, 
and praise all gods great and small, I haven't been in an accident with her 
yet. And, interestingly, most vw bus drivers I see are NOT engaged in any of 
those activities. Most women driving big SUV's seem to have a c-phone grafted 
to the side of their faces. Pay attention, and you'll see that I'm right.
