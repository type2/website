Dear John.

In Great Britain, there are or at least were, combination nuts cum cinched 
washers, available in stainless steel, in most common metric sizes. I intend 
to find out more about them for my own purposes sometime. I don't know 
whether they made any with serrated washers!

VW Heritage Centre advertised stainless steel exhaust manifold studs a few 
years ago.

Regards.

&gt;Temperature is the other killer for &quot;stainless&quot; steels.  But I've been 
&gt;using
&gt;304 to assemble exhausts with flanged serrated nuts for some time and
&gt;they discolor but hold up well.  Got to use antiseize profusely though as
&gt;most 300 series are &quot;soft&quot; and tend to gall easily.  Still nice to be able 
&gt;to
&gt;have the fasteners still recognizeable 5 WV winters on from their install.
&gt;5/16 of course as I'm not keen to pay for metric stainless for all the 
&gt;joints
&gt;on Vanagon exhausts.  I would love to find some stainless 8mm serrated
&gt;flanged nuts for the headers though.
