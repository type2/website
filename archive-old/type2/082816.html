Subject: Fuel Regulator - Engine Not Starting

Hello,
       I don't know too much about engines, and I
don't have the largest fund to put into getting this
fixed, so I thought I'd do it myself to learn and save
some money if I could.  Well, my engine won't start
and when it will, it stays running for about 5
seconds.  I replaced the fuel filter because I thought
the gas was not getting to the carb.  It's a 77 westy
that was converted to carb.  After the gas goes
through the filter, it goes to the fuel pressure
regulator.  What it that?  Could that be clogged or
something?  Or, could it be the carb itself?  Thanks a
lot.  I appreciate all the help that has been given to
me to save some money and learn about fixing the bus,
so I can keep it. 

Peace,
Tim
