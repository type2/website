Hello-

Here's an update on the '76 bus my friend Fletch bought a few weeks ago:

We had 0 compression in cylinder number 4, so the engine came out last 
Saturday.  The head gasket was blown, and has ruined the sealing surface 
of the head.  My guess is it's cheaper to get another head than have this 
one repaired.  

Should we stick with the stock cam, or is there a better aftermarket cam 
out there?

I'm impressed with those connecting rods; they're huge.

Any input appreciated.

Martin Scarr
