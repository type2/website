Colour's always going to be a personal thing, but I remember going through
this same thought process a while back. So I wne to Vanfest, looked at 100s
of different colours, cme away thinking I want something else!!!

Firstly I'd keep with the 2 tone (at the bulge) - unless you're doing a 'cal
look' style custom.

Eliminate the following: Green (I hate green!)
                         Black (hearse/shows up ALL defects in panels)
                         Red (fire engine/ambulance)
                         White (plain Jane)
                         Grey (looks like primer)

Pastel shades work really well, for instance the baby blue, pale yellow, and
several variations of blue/green, olive (yes, I know I said green before, but
I've seen nice green ones).

My fav. solid colour would be orange, great for the &quot;its a VW Bus and it looks
lovely in orange, but you're Ford would look silly in that colour&quot; look. Pink
and white looks good if done well, looks terrible if done badly.

BTW I plumped for dark silver/white, and, to this day, I've only seen about 2
other buses that colour. And it looks lovely with smoked lenses and clear up
front.

RE:	Paint colours

As I remember, there was a thread about 6 months ago about the best colours
for buses. I've tried the archives, but no joy.

Considering that I have a factory high-top, should I go for 1 colour
including the high-top, just the bus or white above the bulge? Since last
year above the bulge is brilliant white &amp; the top is natural fiber glass
dirty white (very). This year I have loads of welding to do on the bottom.

I know that Black doesn't work &amp; my panels are not good enough for metallic,
I don't want an all white bus, what colours do you recommend?
