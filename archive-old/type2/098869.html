Subject: Re: [T2] insurance question....

&gt; I am hoping someone here has experience getting extra insurance for their
&gt; &quot;historic&quot; VW's. I have asked several &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; insurance
&gt; companies, but they will not insure my westy. Either because it is a camper
&gt; or that I want to actually use it! So my question to the group is who are
&gt; you folks getting insurance from? Many of you have put a fair bit of money
&gt; into restoring VW's how are you insuring them? Any help would be
&gt; appreciated, oh by the way I live in MD in case someone knows that their
&gt; company has a license to sell insurance in MD.
&gt; Peace
&gt; Meg

i have had classic insurance on my dormobile for years. recently i added my thing to the policy
and discovered a few new twists.
1. you must have another car to drive
2. the vehicle 'must' be worth 5 grand
3. it must be primarily used to attend shows and events. (not hard every campout is an event!)
 but no longer a max limit on mileage
4 your cost is dependent on stated value. ie you tell them how much you want to insure it for.
5 pictures of all 5 corners.

but it is so cheap by comparrison to regular insurance!  i pay 113$/year for both cars with 100
being the minumum policy amount.  i need to up the value of the dormo as i only have it insured
for $7k and i don't think that would replace it ;-)  but i could more than replace my thing for
the minimum $5k!  i use K &amp; K insurance 1-800-637-4757

if your bus doesnt' meet the criteria try inquiring your regular insurance for 'motor home'
inusrance. that used to be cheaper.  i have progressive and discovered it to be 10 bucks more and
my car ins went up due to lack of multiple car so i left the 78 as just a 'car'.  i had heard that
state farm was favorable to this condition. but i have never used them.  even if you keep it as a
'car' on a regular policy and have invested money in it and it is pre 80 you should get 'stated
value' insurance or they will attempt to tell you it books for 2-3 grand and you'll have to prove
its worth etc if you ever have a claim.  stated insurance is where you tell them the value and
they garuntee that much money back.
