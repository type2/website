&gt;Any help and advice would be wonderful.

You should give Mark Stephens a call. They can probably tell you, based on
the engine number on found on the engine case, what size engine you have.
They are experts in the Type IV engines and can supply what you need for a
rebuild. Most importantly, they can supply you would with heads (or do yours
if yours look pretty cherry) with the valve seats replaced and guaranteed
not to come out for 100,000 miles! Since valve seats dropping is one of the
inherent design flaws of your engine, this is a pretty great guarantee!
