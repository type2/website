Subject: Re: Porsche 944 Engine in a VW Possible?
To: mtb_at_andrew.cmu_dot_edu, type2_at_type2_dot_com

 Hi,
	I'm sure it could be done- there must be substantial similarities
between the 944 engine and the Audi engines that some people have put
in busses. In fact it would probably work quite well, given that the
944 mill is torquey and powerful. However you'd be pretty much
on your own, as it's not an obvious substitution and few people are
likely to have been in your situation.
 I don't suppose your relative has access to aircooled porsche parts?
If so you would be following a reasonably well-trodden path and wouldn't
have to cope with the addition of a radiator to a vehicle that wasn't
designed to have one.
 I won't even try to list the issues that will arise with a 944 substitution,
but for a better idea of what might be involved search the vanagon list
archives (under http://www.vanagon_dot_com, when they're up) for information
on Audi 5-cyl replacements, the issues will be the same and with a bit of
luck so will some of the solutions (since the 944's predecessor used an
Audi sourced engine).
 I'd advise spending lots of time reading the archive postings from this
and the vanagon lists as there is a great deal of information in them
about possible swaps, the pros and cons of each and the amount of work
involved. For ease of conversion there's a lot to be said for sticking
to aircooling in a vehicle that was designed for it and there arn't
many aircooled engines around which have better torque and durability
than the VW (type-4) pancake (the Corvair rotates the wrong way, BTW).
 If you're prepared to engineer a solution to the watercooling issue
there are more options but it's worth giving a lot of thought to what
you are trying to achieve at the end of the process: it's actually quite
difficult to improve on the original without losing something along the
way.

Cheers,
	W.
