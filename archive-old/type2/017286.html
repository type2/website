Subject: mshp, apv engine's

ive been listning for a wile now, and as some of you know ive been
looking for an engine for a 72 bus. ive been going through the arcives
and two places seam to stand out, apv, and mshp. its my understanding
that mshp does different types of rebuilds, stage 1, 2, 3, and .5? ive
heard about stage 1, and 2, but does anyone have any experence with 3?
also does apv just do stock engine's, thats all, i think, is listed at
there web sight, but the arcives suggest otherwise. thanks for any help
you can offer.
