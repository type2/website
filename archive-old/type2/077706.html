Subject: Re: [T2] &amp;*$%*_at_ California Emissions...

I went to one of the no-pass no pay places, so I didn't have to pay the
guy anything. I will try servicing the EGR valve and the pipe that runs to
it and see if that fixes it. If not I guess I will be getting a used one
and trying that route. The whole thing just annoys me, because my bus does
not put out nasty polution, and I have worked hard to get it there. It is
a federal model, which does not require a cat, but I put one on anyway, to
lower my emissions even more. I know that it will pass the sniff test, as
I just had it sniffed by a mechanic, and had the CO adjusted. The mechanic
informed me that it was almost right on, and that the emissions are quite
low before the cat, so I am sure that they are just great after it.

I am very environmentally concious, and while I wish my bus got great gas
millage, I comfort myself with the thought that I am not creating all the
waste that comes with manufacturing a new car, and I am not using any of
that nasty anti-freeze. I also keep her in excelent tune all the time so
that her emissions stay low. Last time I had her tested in AZ she came in
at 1/100th of the max, and that was before I put the cat on!

Thanks for the advice on servicing the EGR. I will be cleaning it out this
week, and will let you all know how it goes.

-Nick
