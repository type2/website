Subject: Looking for parts
Content-Disposition: inline

Greetings

I am looking for the following parts since I have been unable to locate them in catalogs or on the net. All parts are for '76, 2L bus. Thanks

1) alternator cooling air rubber elbow (for 70 amp alt. I believe)
2) lower alternator mounting bolt
3) bottom engine tin covering push rod tubes, right side only
4) the plastic piece that goes on top of the oil breather and connects to a hose
5) boots, preferably urethane, connecting intake manifolds to centermounted   Weber 32/36 DFEV carb mounting
6) seals/gaskets between the same intake manifolds as above and head
7) I have also been having trouble locating any strictly GL4 gear oil locally, is it usually hard to find?

Thanks in advance for any leads or help in locating this parts. Also much thanks to those who offered consolation and much needed advice regarding the head that got stripped out by the plug. I managed to remove engine and will be taking the head in tomorrow. It was the first time I removed the engine, and although it was a bit of work (it took most of Friday and Sunday afternoons), it was a rewarding feeling to have done it. Thanks again for the great encouragement and knowledge found on this list.

peace-
