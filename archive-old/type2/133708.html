&gt;Michael
&gt;I was listening to you, until you said &quot; When the pump is on, it's vacuum
&gt;creates a decrease in pressure on the A side. So it sucks the fuel.&quot;

Okay okay, not vacuum but it is easier to say than, amplified atmospheric 
pressure or the pulling of the fuel, drawing of the fuel, decrease of 
pressure in the fuel line on the supply side, negative pressure, etc. etc. 
It sounds as if you know what I meant and that is what I intended. Thanks.

&gt;Everyone knows there is no such thing as suction,,, the now relatively 
&gt;higher
&gt;pressure on the tank side pushes the fuel into the pump area with lower
&gt;pressure,,,

suction  n.
The act or process of sucking.
A force that causes a fluid or solid to be drawn into an interior space or 
to adhere to a surface because of the difference between the external and 
internal pressures.

pt. v.
suctioned, suctioning, suctions
To draw away or remove by the force of suction: suction fluid from the 
lungs.
To clean or evacuate (a body cavity, for example) by the force of suction.

adj.
Creating suction.
Operating or operated by suction.

Unrelated to vw but how does it push uphill if the level of the fuel pump is 
above the level of the fuel. Would the pump create a vacuum(suction) in 
order to draw the fuel to it or do Hamsters do that, too?


&gt;I know you knew that!
&gt;
&gt;To see this a bit better,,&lt;my way&gt; :-) I learned this from an elder on the 
&gt;VB list,,
&gt;Clara!
&gt;
&gt;  imagine the molecules as Hamsters. Those hamsters
&gt;fill the system,,, when the pump starts, they get push to the low pressure 
&gt;area,,
&gt;some come from the return line, some from the tank,,, and then they go 
&gt;through
&gt;the pump, and around the fuel ring,, some drop into the cylinders and out 
&gt;the
&gt;exhaust,,
&gt;There is a small gate they have to sqeeze thru,&lt;regulator&gt; and this slows 
&gt;them down
&gt;allowing
&gt;the pump to put more in and increasing the pressure on them. Jast after the 
&gt;gate,
&gt;there is few
&gt;hamsters to fill the pipe and the pressure drops off..
&gt;Back at the T,, the ones that return from the gate head towards the pump, 
&gt;and some more
&gt;are needed to replace the ones that went out the exhaust ,,so more come in 
&gt;from the
&gt;tank,,
&gt;  as the rest just keep running around the fuel ring thru the gate, thru 
&gt;the T, back
&gt;to the pump,
&gt;till their turn comes to get pushed through the injectors and out the tail 
&gt;pipe,
&gt;them more pile in
&gt;to take their place.

Basically what it comes down to is, what if all your hamsters are running 
through the fuel ring through the regulator and back to the tee.  They all 
came out of there original hole (the tank oulet) and not enough are leaving 
the ring so too many are heading back to the tee. Is it conceivable that too 
many hampsters end up having to go back through the hole from where they 
came because enough can't jump ship in time and now the hole that let them 
out one at a time is not letting them back in 4 at a time and they are 
starting to get squished. That is excess pressure! I also might add that it 
is just a theory, hamsters or not!LOLLOLLOLLOLLOL.
