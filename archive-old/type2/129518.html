Subject: Clutch noise

Hi all,

The Wonderbus's clutch is making a new noise, and I wonder what it might be.

A couple months ago I removed the badly-built POS engine that the PO was 
sold after it overheated and hammered itself. The bus sat sadly in front 
of the house while I tore the old engine down, determined it was too 
damaged for my meager skills to repair, bought a new Mexican 1600DP 
longblock in Tijuana, built it up and installed it last week. I'm 
breaking the engine in carefully and all seems just fine. Except that, 
when cold, the clutch is makes a brief screeching sound when upshifting, 
mostly between 1st and 2nd, 2nd and 3rd. Only during that brief period 
when it is slipping while the engine is engaging with the transaxle.

Everything on the clutch seemed okay per Bentley. Late-style diaphragm, 
more than enough friction material, no visual damage, alignment tool 
used during re-assembly.
