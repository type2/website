Subject: help!need opinions-pending purchase!

Folks,

I have one day to make up my mind the following 66 kombi,
could use some opinions. I'll do my best to describe its
condition plus surrounding stuff -

After 23 yrs, I decided to restore my 67 deluxe. Cost an 
arm and a leg, as all those who have done this can testify to,
and ypon finishing, I realize that looking the way it does, I 
can no longer drive it daily, or park it just anywhere! But I
need daily trasnsportation, so I've been looking for a similar
vehicle, not as good shape, to drive and get to love.

Was just offered the following (I live in the BAy Area):

'66 Kombi, in very good shape, never hit, original bumpers,
68,00 miles on original motor (single port 1500 -clean running),
tight steering, zero rust underneath. Frame immaculate, all
floors and wheel wells immaculate, quiet tranny, clean interior.
One owner, not counting the present holders who wish to sell
it for quick profit.

DAmage:  slight rust around all windows and under windshields,
(original rubber all around,mostly cracked and porous).
Battery floor in right rear corner mostly rusted away - only real
rust on car other than around windows.

 All body panels straight, two small tiny shallow dents. Original
paint mostly shiny. Engine runs and sounds real good.
All glass present and fine.

Problem: They want $5000. It's real steep for me, but I could
do it if I just squint real tight and don't think!

Question: What is it really worth on today's market?

The reason I have one day to decide is that they're taking it
to a meet this wkend to sell.

Thanks to all who respond,

cjay
