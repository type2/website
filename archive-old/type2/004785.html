&gt; The main thing is getting from CA to IND and in that case, I'd fly out
there with one head &amp; a
&gt; compression tester. first thing you do is get the bus warmed up, then run
a compression test, you have to find out
&gt; which cylinder is too low so you can replace the appropriate head.

If you do this, make sure the head you bring is a left head. It will work on
either side. If you bring a right head and the left head [#3 cylinder] is
bad, you will not be able to install the cylinder head temp sensor. Make
sure the head you bring has a 10mm x 1.0 hole to the left of the left intake
port as you are looking at the head with the spark plugs pointing up.
