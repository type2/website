Subject: Re: cleaning vinyl seats

&gt; My original, basketweave seats (especially the driver's seat) are almost
&gt; tatooed with engine oil.  I've found that car top vinyl cleaner, scrubbed
in
&gt; with a toothbrush, gets it out, but it's excuciatingly slow.  Any
&gt; suggestions?

You might want to try Amway's L.O.C  (liquid organic cleaner). It is
excellent for removing tough stuff like grease off of anything (including
carpeting after it has been unwittingly ground into it... don't ask me how I
know.) It's very gentle and biodegradable. Works great on clothes and hands
too.
