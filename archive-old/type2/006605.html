I did this job last summer on my '69.  Here's what I did:
Take out windshield, exposing rust.  It was all along where the bottom of
the seal sits, punctuated by a few ~3/16inch  holes completely through the
metal.
I scraped, then sandblasted the rusty areas, then swept and vacuumed the
sand from a 150 foot radius around my bus.  When all was nice and clean I
applied bondo from my local auto body supply place to wherever there were
holes, then sanded until it looked smooth. After letting the bondo cure
overnight I primered, then painted the seal area to around an inch past
where the where the edge of the seal is.  It helped that the PO saved a bit
of paint from the last paint job.  It doesn't match exactly, but you really
only notice the 'racoon' effect on the paint job when you are standing right
next to it.  I did the job outside, over a few days in the summer.  I also
hade someone else put the windshield in, since I cracked mine while taking
it out, and couldn't afford to buy too many of them.  It sealed up tight and
the rust hasn't come back yet.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;   My Bus has a cracked windshield that can't be repaired, it has to be
replaced. There is a bit of rust beneath the windshield and it extends under
the rubber a little. So I figure I should do somethin about the rust before
the glass goes in. So here's the real question. Since I plan on getting a
resto-quality paint job on it in say, a year or so, what would be the best
method of attack on the rust? I don't wanna do a half-arsed job, but I don't
wanna go over board either. The rust is bad enough that it will require some
body work to get her cherry. But for now, I want to arrest the rust.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; JJ
