&gt; stopped production. These were sold exclusively in Canada apparently.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, any thoughts on where I might be able to track one of these down? Or 
&gt; am I forever stuck with an oddball tire?


some of the Michelin tires are now sold under the Agilis name, same tire
different name, check under that,... I understand how you feel I run
nothing but Michelins and got some of the're last Michelin X tires for my
van....have a 99S rating almost 2,000 lbs per tire
