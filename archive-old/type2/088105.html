Subject: San Fr to Humbolt, Ca listees- Mac computer help??

Off topic, but you'd get a chance to show your bus to my
bus-loving daughter who literally grew up with our 78 Westy!
  Daughter and SO are traveling in a rental to the Redwoods along the coast
above SF and have had trouble getting on line with their new Mac laptop
(think it's an issue with dialling a # to get outside line-get busy signals
on prodigy # plugged in). They'll likely overnight by Humbolt or start
heading back to SF.  SO desperately needs to get a file by Mon AM our time-
any listees near there who can offer Web access or anyone with ideas (like
entering dialup for MAC OS X please contact me- email or call 609-737-3767.
