&gt; That's for sure, Al. Always validate the filter and flow before condeming

&gt; &gt;Mark:
&gt; &gt;I think the filter or intake pipe is plugged. NO $127 or $220 pump will
&gt; &gt;make up for that!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Try compressed air on the gas filler if fuel doesn't run out. As a last
&gt; &gt;resort, blow it backwards. Be really careful to only allow about 20-30 PSI
&gt; &gt;into the tank, they are not made to be an air compressor tank!

REMOVE GAS CAP FIRST!
make sure no one is on side of bus opposite the gas cap.

then blow
