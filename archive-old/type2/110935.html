Subject: [T2] new starter and still no start!

well i have loosened the tranny bolts put a new starter on and have changed the ignition coil ....
the points is the only thing i can think it can be..
maybe they are off causeing it to not turn over is this possible..

the flywheel was turning fine when i mated the engine and tranny together...
now i cant get the enigne to spin at all...
i am confues to where to go from here...
some one said needle in a hey stack...
i be dag gum if this needle isnt exspensive...

i dont see sparks now since i found what was touching...
the new starter doesnt whine either but i dont and havent left it on long enough to just try to get it to crank and right back out real fast...

what else can it be..??
