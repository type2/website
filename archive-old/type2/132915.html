Subject: Zinc - is it good ?

I have been told that spraying bare metal with zinc is a good thing as it
bonds well and protects against rust better than paint. I've heard of zinc
plating but not spray on zinc paints (is it a paint technically ?)

The guy who told me this was a mechanic who wrecked my Beetle because while
he talked a good repair, he couldn't do one. I'd normally reguard his
suggestions as rubbish EXCEPT the zinc painted bits of metal haven't rusted
while the car is stored awaiting repair and this isn't the only place I
have heard this suggestion.

Now I am interested because I have just bought a front beam to use as a
spare. It's cleans and has only minor surface rust (Austrailian import so
left hand drive - hooray). I'm going to get it sand blasted and will then
paint it so I'm looking at options.

Incidentally - powder coating and POR15 are out. Can't get either around
here.
