Subject: 73 Engine Compartment Wiring

In case ya'll haven't noticed, I'm not in California. :( We ran out of $$.
(In fact, wife bounced the rent check... long story... sigh)

Anyway, after my wiring meltdown a couple weeks ago, I decided to pick up
some stuff to make the wiring a bit safer.

Here are the items that draw off the ignition switch in the engine
compartment:

Coil (duh)
Pertronix
Hyfire module
Electric fuel pump
Tach
Carb chokes x2
Carb solenoids x3 (should be 4, but one's blocked off)
(soon) engine compartment lighting

That's a lot of stuff to come off one little wire that runs all the way to
the front of the bus and back. And with it being unfused (at least as it
came to me) there's some danger there. After the spade connector popped off
the left carb and shorted against the solenoid housing frying my wiring, I
decided I needed fuses.

I picked up a 5 circuit fuse block. Some suggested circuit breakers, but I
think I'd rather have to get my arse back there to see what the problem is
instead of just wait for the thing to reset and starting a fire or
something. I decided I'm going to keep my 30a relay. It just makes more
sense to me to minimize the current flowing through the already tired
ignition switch. Even if I get a new one, the quality won't be up to the OG
switch, so this is just a good idea all around.

So today is the day! I'm mounting the fuse block on the wheel well near the
battery, along with my relay. Wiring bundle will go from there along the
firewall clips that are already there, then to the coil. Should clean up my
engine compartment a bit and keep things safe.

I'll post pics when I'm done.
