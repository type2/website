&gt; If this is the part number I think it is, I don't believe it is
&gt; discontinued. ...  Check with your dealer, for part # 021 903 655D
&gt; and if that's indeed the one you need, he should be able to get it for you
for
&gt; about $16.


&gt; List and Ron,
&gt;
&gt; I just called my friendly local VW parts man and, sure enough, there were
&gt; 10 of the #021 903 655D alternator cooling boots located in the California
&gt; parts warehouse.  I ordered one and wanted to tell others that there are
&gt; actually some out there--$16.00 just like Ron said! Go get 'em...


But did you also confirm the part number/application?  While I had been told
by one customer that this was a 70 amp alternator boot, the original poster
says that it may in fact be a 55 amp alternator boot (hence my suggestion
that you check with the dealer).
