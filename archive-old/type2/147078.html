Subject: Re: [T2] cv boots

Hey Dan,
I would jack up the car and set it on some jack stands so the wheel can 
spin freely.  That way you can have easy access to all of the bolts.  I 
noticed that some people said to drive on top of a piece of wood or 
ramps, but I tried that and it drove me nuts when I didn't have easy 
access to the bolt, *especially* if you need to use vice grips to get 
'em off!

I would spray those suckers down with some kind of degreaser about an 
hour or so before you work on it.  Also, you might want to get yourself 
a new set of bolts.  It's always nice to have a new set because you end 
up stripping them sometimes.

Mike
