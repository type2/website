Subject: Re: [T2] vanagon wt.

The titles I have on three 81-83 Westfalias list them as 3500 pounds.
Trannys last a long time, I replaced one at 195K.
I've got an 81 manual tranny Westy and the tranny has 91 K on it and it
shifts smooth as butter. Much better than the other 4 speeds I've got.
4 speed manual trannys for 80-83 Aircooled are hard to find and even used
can run $500.00, rebuilts with an exchange as much as $1000.00, core
charges if you've got a bad case or bad ring and pinion set can be as
much as $450.00.
Make sure the tranny is good or take $600.00 off the price the seller is
asking.

83 Westfalia Aircooled &amp; an 82 same thing for sale.

&gt; Listees:
&gt; In my ongoing bus hunt, may I ask another question, pls?
&gt; 
&gt; '79 Bay vs. 80 vanagon:
&gt; Theoretically, the vanagon handles better, has more room (and from 
&gt; what
&gt; i've seen--less rust). But weighs more.
&gt; 
&gt; How much do these models (non-westy) weigh restpectively?  (I've 
&gt; searched
&gt; the net, but can't find that data.)
&gt; And is that enough to trash trannies?
&gt; 
&gt; TNX 4 ur patience.
