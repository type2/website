Well...found it. It was the intake manifolds -- both sides. The &quot;first on 
right side, then on left side&quot; issue turned out to be whichever side happened 
to be the loudest. Once I got the left side tightned down properly with new 
gaskets, then it switched back to the right side. Fixed that and now all is 
well...

Now just got to figure out where the new oil leak is coming from since it sat 
all winter.
