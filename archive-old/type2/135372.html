&gt;You may be right, but if you are, then Wilson is wrong:
&gt;
&gt;&quot;You want a minimum of 0.020 in. (0.51mm)
&gt;with up to 0.050 in. (1.27mm) acceptable.
&gt;What you don't want is less than 0.020 in.

Wilson seems to have a level of insight left out of Bentley in this case, or so it would seem.

&gt;&quot;Adjust the clearance by changing shims.
&gt;You can install any number of shims of differ-
&gt;ent thicknesses to get the desired clearance as
&gt;long as you have at least two shims in Type
&gt;1?3 engines and one in Type 4s. Shims are
&gt;available at the dealer and VW parts houses.&quot;

The two drive pinions are very different and I haven't measured them to compare length but two 0.60mm shims is almost as thick as one 1.30mm shim. That 0.10mm difference means there is a good chance you'll be in spec whether you add the additional Type 1 shim or not (if it fits).
