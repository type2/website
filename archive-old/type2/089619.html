Subject: 71 Crew cab for sale in Florida

--part1_10f.156f06db.2a8a5998_boundary

Everyone,

Well, I've had my 71 crew up for sale on the samba_dot_com for two months now and 
have only had people outside te USA who are interested. Is there anyone on 
this list that lives in Florida? I'm only asking $3,950 for this truck and it 
is one of the most rust free trucks  I have ever seen. No, it is not RUST 
FREE, but it only has a few minor areas to repair. check out my website and 
the samba ad (for more pics). http://members.aol_dot_com/vwdude1957/vwtruck.html
I really need to sell this truck. Any help would be appreciated.

Dave
