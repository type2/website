Subject: RE: [T2] Removing tin from under motor (passenger side) to get
  to thermostat

Dave,

Thanks for the suggestion... I think those are better suited to cracking a
nut... my problem is that the nut is inside the H/E.

It has also been suggested by others to simply cut the bolt (Dremel cutoff
tool or such)... while this is a good idea, I'm concerned that there will
then be a rusty nut and part of a bolt rattling around in the H/E.

For now, it's loose and I had enough play to rotate the tin to get the new
thermostat in... which is working - yippy.  I've got the tin back in place
with one bolt a bit loose.  I might wrap some wire around it to snug it up a
bit.  Yes a Rub Goldberg... but for now it will work.

Again, thanks and do keep your ideas coming.

Wayne,

Could you use one of these on it?

/SubCatID/9975.0/file.htm

or, a dremel tool cutter to literally cut the nut off of the bolt without 
damaging the bolt?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Group,

 I'm preparing to put in my new thermostat and while removing the tin I ran
 into a problem.  One of the bolts that holds the tin in place is giving me
a
 problem... the bolt that goes into the middle of the heat exchanger spins
&gt; and won't come out.  My guess at this point is that there is a capture nut
&gt; behind it (inside the H/E) that has broken loose and is just spinning.
So,
&gt; without removing the exhaust, I can't think of how to resolve this - or if
&gt; 
&gt; Your feedback and other thoughts would be appreciated.
