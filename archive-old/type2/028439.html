Yes on the vacuum leak test.

On the oil...don't think about it...VW already did and they are smarter that
you or me. Those are the factory recommendations.

Yes on the underside of the jugs between them.  Got em?  Good!

Slight scoring on the sides of the RV pistons is normal and won't affect
anything.  Might wanna put better oil in there tho and change regularly ;-)

So, you spray water on the suspected vacuum leak and see if there is a
change in idle RPM in response?

Oil type - well, I hear what you're saying and....I'll think about it.

There are little tin pieces between the cylinders - are those the forget me
nots?

The tops of the RV pistons were clean and shiny - it was the sides of the
bypass RV piston that were scored.
