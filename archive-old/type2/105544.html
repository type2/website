Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Starvation?

&gt;It's a '79, FI.  Changed the fuel filter back in Nov when I noticed the
&gt;problem wasn't going away.  It used to seem better when it was warm, now
&gt;it just sputters 'till it dies and won't start 'till it sits awhile.

Fuel line inlet inside gas tank.

Dunno about the late bay windows but my '65 Beetle had a wire mesh &quot;sock&quot; 
over it. It rusted away until it began letting junk into the line. Clogged 
it up hard. Required me to run a stiff wire into the fuel line and break 
loose gunk that had settled in the fuel line and solidified. Luckily on the 
bus you'll only have to clean a few inches of fuel line.
