I am getting ready to slap a used 1800 in my 74 bus.  I am tyring to
figure out the holes in the heads, 2 on one, 1 on the other. are these
the air injection ports mentioned in the archives? What do I do with
them? The engine that came out had 2 on each head, I did not see anything
connected to them. Do I need to plug them?
Thanks,
