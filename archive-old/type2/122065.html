Subject: Covair Conversions

I would think that since the corvair had a much shorter production run then
type 1/2/4 motors, finding parts for a Vdub with a Corvair conversion would
be even more challenging and costly.

Right now on E-bay there are 42 Bus/Vanagon's, 105 bugs, 29 Karmanns, 3
things.. and other weird stuff. That's (C)  200 vehicles.  There are 16
covairs.   sort of the case &amp; point of limited part resources.

With current mods affordable and available for our beloved VW power plants,
does it really make sense to wedge a GM Corvair motor into a type II frame?
Or Subaru for that matter...

I guess I may be in the dark never having driven one.  I've got a stock '78
westy automatic.  The FT engine will go 80 or better if I &quot;have to&quot;, but
then again it's a Vdub, so... why?....  It's the Karma...

as a side comment... we don't exactly have LA traffic in South Dakota.  Most
of it still looks like &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; ... we can see the horizon's
landscape till it drops of the curvature of the earth and most likely count
all the traffic between here and there.
