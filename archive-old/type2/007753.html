Subject: Re: Hydraulic Valve Adjustment
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a 78 bus with 197,000 mi on the engine- never rebuilt, but I've
relaced lifters once in its life.  (Not sure it was necessary- I had the
clatter, and a shop said it was needed, but I do all my own work now).
Lifters can bleed out the oil and let air in when there is too much wear
between the piston wall and lifter bore or when the little hole in the side
of the lifter faces down-  Normally it will pump back up when you drive
steadily for about 15 minutes to thin the oil (no hills), or put a brick on
the pedal and let it run for at least that long.
   A spongy lifter can still be adjusted (you should do it cold!)- There is
a spring below the piston that keeps the piston up against the pushrod, and
if you loosen the adjustor screw nut, you can back up the adjustor until it
turns freely.  Now gently screw it back in and you can FEEL when it
actually contacts the valve end.  From that point you memorize the slot of
the adjustor and turn it in at least one full turn  (the prescribed 2 turns
is ok)- you want to be in the middle of the piston play range and be aware
the play LESSENS as the engine warms up- I've looked at the play and it's
over 1.5mm!   Do this for all the valves and you can then warm it up to see
if it pumps up.  If id doesn't, you CAN pump it up by removing it and
popping the circlip, take apart the lifter, and reassemble under oil-
Bentley has a routine for this- personally I'd just get another lifter if
it won't pump up and has over 80K on it!  I take the new ones and put them
under oil and pump the piston up and down to see if any air comes up- it's
a quickie way to see if air's in it.   Reinstall it with the side hole UP!
