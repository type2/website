Sorry for the non-technicality of this message but....I don't know what
its called.
here's the story...
I looked at a 71 super beetle today for sale (anyone interested? its a
real beauty!  $6500...give me a holler) and saw its engine...of course.
I noticed that mine doesn't have the oil bath air filter (already knew
this...why it doesn't have it I don't know) and on the carb I noticed
something I don't have...but have the mount for.  Its a little mount
that comes off of the carb...the base of the carb...its a ring that
looks like it should hold something....yup!  sure does!  but I don't
have it....on the bug it had 2 hoses coming out of a little circular
plate kinda thing mounted in the ring of the mount.  It faces toward the
back...BIB... of the bus.... The guy said it was something to do with
the vacuum advance.  I have a vacuum advance on my distributor, but
don't have this little thingamabobber....  Should I have this thing?  My
engine runs fine without it... will it blow up at highway speeds?  Will
it overheat and turn my case a pretty purple?  Do these shoes look good
on me?  Did I leave the toaster on??

seriousely though....I would really like to know what this is for and if
I should have it/where I can get it/ what its called.

The faster the reply the better as I will ...hopefully.... be visiting
with David Schwarze (listee from TX)tomorrow and traveling around the
state looking at assorted V-dubs...

Thanks much!
Isaiah
