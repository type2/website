&gt;This 2.0 case should be true, but I will have it checked, and align-bored, 
&gt;if need be. I hear that over-sized bearings for the type 2/4 mains are few 
&gt;and far between. Thoughts?

Why bother?  The mains are way over-engineered as-is.

&gt;I will start with a counter-weighted crank, and have all of the 
&gt;rotating/reciprocating mass in the motor absolute-zero balanced. I will 
&gt;have the flywheel lightened, as the added mass in the crank counter-weights 
&gt;will more than offset any harmonic wobble, and create adequate mass for a 
&gt;smooth idle. Thoughts on how much to have shaved off the flywheel? 

None.  There is no reason to lighten the flywheel.  First of all, the mass
added to your crank has a very short radius, and is not going to have much
effect on anything.  Second, the flywheel mass is not there for a smooth
idle, it's there to help you pull away from a light without killing the
engine.  In the case of a bus, more is better, within reason.  More mass
will slow your rate of acceleration slightly but based on my experience I
can tell you that it will not be noticable.

&gt;Next, I would like to go with a set of NPR 96mm flat-top pistons. I built a 
&gt;couple sets in a 914's (one of which was mine), and loved them. I am a 
&gt;little concerned about their ability to shed the heat that pushing the 
&gt;Westy could create. Thoughts? Anybody run a set of these in a 1976-1983 Van 
&gt;or Westy? Any problems? Anyone have a set of NOS NPR 96's for a 2.0 for 
&gt;less than $300? Will probably have the pistons polished. Is this worth it? 
&gt;Does this reduce friction, reduce predetonation? By the way, the pistons 
&gt;that are coming out of the motor have less than 20k on them. They are 
&gt;genuine VW. Are they worth anything?

My only experience with 96mm pistons is that there was a set in my bus when
I bought it, and one of them had a hole in it.  From a reliability
standpoint I would say stay away from them - they can't be more reliable
than 94mm ones.  However if you still want to pursue them, I got an e-mail
from a guy recently telling me about a coating you can have applied to the
outside of the cylinders to increase heat dissipation.  Sounded really
interesting.  If that person would like to comment, that would be great,
otherwise let me know if you're interested and I'll dig out the e-mail.

As for the flat top pistons, without that 15cc dish you will need to be
careful of your compression ratio.  If you are really going to drive as you
describe I would stay under 7.5.

The purpose of polishing the pistons and combustion chamber is 1) to resist
the buildup of deposits, and 2) to eliminate sharp edges which can cause
detonation.

&gt;I would like to have some bigger valves in the heads, and have the 
&gt;combustion spaces polished. How much bigger can the valves be without 
&gt;swapping RELIABLY for performance? Is it too risky? Seems like respiration 
&gt;is a rich lode of improvement for the type 2/4, but I don't want problems, 
&gt;either.

You can easily go to 41mm intake valves, and (I think) 34mm exhausts.
Those are the &quot;1800&quot; or 1974 sizes.  Of course, the larger the valve, the
more problem you have with shrouding.  There's a question of how big a
valve you actually need - there is a point of diminishing returns, and my
*opinion* at this point is that it's a lot smaller than most people
believe.  I have 41's in my engine now, and I didn't notice any increase in
performance versus the smaller valves I had before that.  But then I have
tiny carbs.  VW chose to go really small on their FI 2-liter engine's
valves - can't remember but it's something like 37 or 38mm.  I'm sure they
had a reason for doing this - it was probably for increased velocity which
improves low-end torque.  My next set of heads (already got them from MSHP)
have the 1700 sized valves, which are a step down in size, and I expect
improved performance.  The bottom line is that unless you are going to
install some big carbs and manifolds on your engine and have the ports
seriously worked over, I wouldn't bother with bigger valves.  From a
reliability standpoint I don't think there is any difference, but
increasing the valve size without working over the rest of the intake will
just hurt power production.

&gt;The motor will have a oil-pressure boost springs, a Melling high-capacity 
&gt;oil pump, an oil thermostat, and an auxiliary oil cooler mounted up front 
&gt;behind the stock grill.

I had the Mellling pump, didn't notice a huge improvement, but I guess it
didn't hurt anything either.  Might have helped a little, and it was cheap.
 You will need the aux. oil cooler.

&gt;Finally, assuming that I have done all of the above, is it worth it to add 
&gt;higher-ratio rocker arms? Seems like it would be. I can't think of any 
&gt;reliability issues that those could influence. Thoughts?

The rocker arm studs are not that strong, and higher ratio rockers would
just put more stress on them.  It also puts more stress on the cam, which
already has a problem with wear.  It also lowers your maximum rpm before
valve float, but that may or may not be a problem.  

If you want more power with no hit to reliability, I would stay away from
gimmicky things like high ratio rocker arms and go for a 2.2l stroker engine.
