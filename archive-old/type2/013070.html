Hi,

I have owned a 62, 69, 71, 77 and presently a 78 westfalia. The 71 was a freak. I had no fuel gauge so I made it a habit to fill every 250 
miles. I always put about 35 liters in it. That's just  over 9 US gallons. I once made a mistake and looked down at my odometer and 
realized that I was at 350 miles not 250 and a way away from the nearest town. I rolled into a gas station on fumes having driven 398 miles 
(that was a tank of premium and I suspect that it helped). That's 27.5 mpg US. My current 78 averages about 17-18 mpg. I have never 
actually done an equally flat drive to the case above but I suspect that the 78 would have run out of gas. 

I aggree about carb tuning being a big factor in mileage. My 62 got 300 miles on a 40 liter tank. Fact is though, both those busses had a 
tendency to overheat. I think a lot of us, like myself, have FI busses that used to be from california and no longer have the emission stuff 
they once had but still have the old ECU. I think our mixture could no longer be optimal. I picked up a Federal FI system for spares so I 
may swap the distributor and ECU for the hell of it and see what happens. I have been meaning to clean and test my dizzy anyway. 
Anyone know if an old california bus with federal emission and exhaust setup would behave weird?

Bob
