[Hi Dave,] The rusty areas that you are talking about, are quite common rust
spots on type 2s, I had the same problem on mine.  when I got a quote for
mine, they wanted a few hundred pounds!! to sort it out, well I thought sod
that! So I went out and purchased a welder for about £100, and did some
practiceing on some scrap metal first, then I repaired the rust myself by
first cutting out the rust with an angle grinder, then welding in some
patches, to replaice the rust, I then ground down the welds, put some seam
sealer on them then primed, and top coated the job with a couple cans of the
appropriate white, sounds all to easy does'nt it, well the truth is it is!
after a couple of hours practice, you will be producing perfectly
acceptable, and vertually invisible welds, trust me! and it will save you a
fortune.
                                good luck Steve.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt;    This weekend I thought I'd devote some time to my 72 dormobile.....
&gt;    Too cut a long story short, I decided to take out the large cabinet
&gt; section behind the drivers seat (rhd)... arghh ! There is a large rusty
gash
&gt; (about 5mm wide, 30cm long) on the floor section where it meets the back
of
&gt; the seat (the seat back is also quite rusty, a gash at the level of the
&gt; bottom of the front door) also the near-side rear wheel arch is very
&gt; rusty... left side is fine !
&gt; What should I do... replace the floor section, seat back and rear wheel
arch
&gt; ? If so... what is it likely to cost ?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Dave K.
