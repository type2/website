Hi all:

Got my crankcase reassembled without pinching any bearings.  
Crank turns freely, rods slip nicely.  New pistons installed - some 
more freely than others - and am ready to slip on the cylinders.

The references say oil ring gap up.  My oil ring has no gap.  
Actually, it's a three-piece affair that came on the Cofap pistons, 
made of one central waffly piece and two skinny rings.  The waffly 
piece has red/green paint on it where it butts together - no gap.  
The skinny rings (I'm not talking about the other two &quot;real&quot; rings, 
now) do have gaps.  Center the skinny ring gaps and the paint 
marks at the top?  New ring style, never mind?

Next question: the other two rings should have their gaps spaced 
120 degrees away, i.e., if all rings have gaps, the gaps are 
equidistant about the piston circumference?  I ask because 
Haynes seems to suggest that the gaps are to be equidistant 
within the top 180 degrees, i.e., equidistant but all in the same 
&quot;hemisphere&quot;.

How many folks put sealant around the base of the cylinders 
(where the paper gasket is), as suggested by the engine rebuild 
video?

Thanks!
joe
