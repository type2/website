Subject: Re: [T2] Wiring in an inverter

I put a 1200 watt inverter in mine to run the
microwave! Learned not to do so while driving at 60mph
on two lane hiway, but that is indeed a different
story and besides the burns are all healed now!

The switching you seek is common to boat people. I got
a lot of help at West Marine and ended up buying my
cables there (6 foot run with almost no loss = $$$) I
have no need for automatic switching as I only have
one outlet hardwired to the inverter - I never use it
for frivolous stuff - just hungry-time mostly while
en-route to a destination (rest areas, etc.) -BaH

&gt; I am gettinng my 78 back from the body shop soon and
&gt; here is what I would

&gt; 
&gt; I would like to keep the shore power input system
&gt; from the van and add an
&gt; inverter to the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody done this?  Making the internal 120
&gt; outlet deliver 120AC
&gt; wether it be from shore power or an inverter.  Has
&gt; anybody figured out
&gt; some kind of remote switch, or even something auto
&gt; sensing/switching to
&gt; switch the outlet delivering shore power or inverter
&gt; power.
&gt; 
&gt; Have I made this confusing enough?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be most appreciated!
