&gt; Subject: books on bodywork?

&gt; Thinking about buying a book on do-it-yourself bodywork, something to
&gt; ease me into that kind of stuff. (I actually despise bodywork, but it
&gt; looks like I'll just have to bite the bullet...) Any good
&gt; recommendations?

Sami,

Whatever you do, don't buy _VW_Body_Work_ from Clymer unless you
like cartoons or want *very basic* instructions on the use of
sandpaper, etc. It does show some drawings of bus panels, but
nothing you couldn't see by looking at your bus.

I recommend you see if a local high school, college or trade
school has courses in body work.  If you can locate one near you,
buy the textbook required for the course.  It may not be very
VW-specific, but it will have very good information and
directions.
