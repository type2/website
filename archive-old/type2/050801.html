Larry,  

My first thought is that the wire that comes off the headlight switch to the dash lights has come loose.  It has a small connector on it to the headlight switch and for me everything I have pulled my instrument panel off I've had to reconnect the little wire to the headlight switch.

Between the 2 of us, my buddy and I have three Type 2s ('68 crew, '70 &amp; '71
sunroof busses) with the same problem.  The dash lights on all three are non
functioning.  Is this a common occurrence or are we just cursed?  Do we need
to take the instrument pod out to fix it or should we look some place else
in the wiring?
