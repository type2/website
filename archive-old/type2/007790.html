I just got back from the photo store where I had all my pics from the fan
belt toss put on floppy disk in JPEG  format....anyone interested in seeing
my cool corvair powered bus, just send me your private e-mail address and
I'll send you a couple. 
  Soon I hope to have my new web site up where I plan to have lots of pics
of the conversion and the photos and stories and manuals for the
conversion. I also plan on showing some of my art , which will include
paintings of all type 2s and corvairs, anyways I'll talk to you
soon.....Keith
