Just replace them. Much easier. I have type 2 bulb housings for 25 dollars a
pair or complete assemblies for 50 dollars a pair.

Subject: [T2] tail light sockets


ok, i've got my tail lights ['71 westy] more or less working again, 
but the problem with them seems to be flaky bulb sockets on both 
sides. the bulbs lock into the bayonet socket, but they're not very 
firmly held in place. if you push in on the bulb a little too much, 
the spring loaded contacts don't push the bulb into the bayonet. i 
don't really see how these can be repaired, since it's a small 
internal part. i'm thinking at this point that maybe i just need to 
buy new tail light assemblies, which should have firmer sockets.

before i order this, does anyone know of a trick to retension the 
springs? i couldn't see how this thing would come apart to do it 
myself.
