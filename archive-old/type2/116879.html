Subject: CFMs of things

Here's one for those with entirely too much time on their hands:

What's the CFM of the cooling fan on a T1 motor at 1K-6K rpm ... where the 
air ducts attach to the heater boxes?

Not that I'm fantasizing about making a supercharger or any such foolish 
thing like that. Just wondering, that's all.
