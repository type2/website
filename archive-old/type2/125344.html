Subject: RE: [T2] ignition improvements

&gt; Hello Guys   I personnally use the Crane units. These used to 
&gt; be made by Allison  I have one in my 67 bug that has been
&gt; there for over 15 years. Have one in the ole grey 59 panel for 
&gt; 5 years now  no problems  I have tried 3pertronixs and they 
&gt; all failed. use the same blue coil and open the gap on the plugs.  
&gt; Later  and have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service


I carry this Crane unit, incidentally...
