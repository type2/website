Subject: Looking for westy in Noethern Cal.

I'm visiting in Northern California for a few weeks, Santa Rosa
specifically.  I flew out here in the hopes of finding a westy (preferrably
a late bay) and driving it home to Minneapolis, as there aren't too many
good buses back there.  Once home, I'm planning to convert it to run on lpg,
possibly with a watercooled engine (subaru?) depending on the condition of
the one that comes with it.  My budget isn't very large, I can afford about
$1000-$1500, depending on how long I wait (I'm working while I'm out here).

So, I'm looking for a late bay westy with an okay body and an engine that's
got at least 3000 miles left in it.  I'll be here til at least 1/15/2000,
and have to be back in MN by 2/15/2000.

Thanks for any info anyone can provide...

-Ian
