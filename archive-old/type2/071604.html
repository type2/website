re;Trust NO ONE, test drive, inspect, ask questions, take
a professional or experienced person with you if possible &amp; if you still
can't be sure WALK AWAY! Think it over, look at the evidence &amp; trust your
gut.

 This is so true ,,a customer of mine bought a 23-window 57 as a &quot;restored &quot;
vehicle ,,and now it is in my shop getting about 300 lbs of bondo taken out
,,installing a new nose,replacing the rear corners,cargo floor ,patching the
front floor
both rockers , replacing both cargo doors, dog legs ,,welll any way you get
the picture ,,,,this is blanten rip off and gives honest restorers a bad name
,,not to mention a bad taste in our mouths ,,,,i vented on the list about this
bus when i brought it into my shop and its now to the point where  you can
visit my pages and see some of the so called restoration ,,and i use that term
as loosely as i possibly can and keep the language clean ,,,warning not pretty
pics and just generally ticks me off everytime i walk in the shop and see it
,,oh well i gotta eat so i'll fix it ,,just hate to see one one get shafted
and not kissed ,,,sorry for the venting ,,Kelly
