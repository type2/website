Subject: Cylinder base spacers

2.0L type IV engine.  I am looking for 0.010&quot; cylinder base spacers 
(shims) so that I can get my engine back together.  I ordered these 
through Bus Depot (P/N 80510), but they no longer carry them since 
evidently their source (Motorwerks) is no longer in business.  I have 
two questions:
1.  Can anyone identify another source for these shims?
2.  Can the cylinders be installed without shims with sealant between 
the block and cylinder base?  My measurements show that if I were to 
use no shim, I would acheive a compression ratio of 7.3 : 1 which is 
stock.  Using the 0.010&quot; shims would give me a slightly shy of 7.2 : 1.
