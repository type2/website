Hi folks
I've just got to put my bit in here. Over the last few years I have 
noticed how here in the UK the attitude towards driving has 
deteriorated. People are possessed by their cars. Ok so we don't suffer 
with the horn tooting problem you get in the States but you always get 
the impression that if 30mm cannon were standard fit to modern cars it 
would be a battlezone out there. I have of late become somewhat sedate 
in my driving habits realising that going fast and taking risks acheives 
nothing, I can get across town just as quickly at or below the speed 
limit as someone who jumps lights and speeds everywhere. The difference 
being is that I am not stressed and do not want to kill anyone by the 
end of the day. If I had anything to do with it I would ban the 
manufacture of cars that can do in excess of 70mph in the UK. This would 
solve a number of problems, deaths, stress, police time, and this stupid 
fixation everyone has about the 'street cred of their car'. I like our 
bus, it can do 50-60mph which is plenty for me. My wife is about to take 
delivery of a 3 cylinder, 800cc car that has a top speed of 89mph (which 
it will never get near). All this is our attempt at getting out of this 
car dominated attitude. A lot of people smirk but underneath they really 
wish they had the balls to do it!
Anyway for the UK folk, reading this months VolksWorld mag, it appears 
that the Vehicle Exise Duty (Car Road Tax) exemption for vehicles built 
before Jan 1973 will remain in force for the forseeable future, nice to 
have a 72 bus and see 'nil' on the tax disc!! We could really do with 
campaigning for the re-instatement of the 25 year rule, for the US folk, 
we used to have a rule that once your vehicle became 25 years old it 
became a 'historic vehicle' and was exempt from our Vehicle Exise Duty 
which is currently 150:00 UK pounds per year. Recently they (our beloved 
Government) changed it to 'any vehicle built before January 1973'. My 
bus was built in July(ish) 1972 and so is exempt, but friends have 
machines that were built only a couple of months later and have to pay. 
With this rule, by the time my bus is 50 years old (I hope) my friend 
will still be paying road tax.
That's it.

Mike
