Subject: Rear seat belts, was Bus Legalities

My westy has them for the back seat, however, the van technically, if it has 
buckets, is a 2 seater if the bed in back is down and made up as such... was 
able to legally be in the carpool lane on the San Francisco-Oakland bay 
bridge in this configuration (2 people in 2 seat vehicles, otherwise 3 
needed), as there was no safe and legal place for more than 2 passengers to 
sit in the bus.  Saved $2 in toll, and after I was stopped once, they never 
bothered me again... in fact, the bike cop that pulled me over originally 
usually smiled and waved when he saw us after that. &lt;grin&gt;

I had a couple pillows and a comforter back there (like usual), so it looked 
like a bed, not a folded seat.  Were the seat up, then no way - it's a 5 
seater :~( .
