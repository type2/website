Subject: re:    Pertronix questions

  I've had two Pertronix fail me on my '71.  Both times were on hot summer 
days. The 
last time I was cruising down the freeway about 65 miles an hour and had just 
said to myself &quot;She's running great today!&quot; when it started. It begins with 
an instant of
going dead as if you turned the switch off for a second and then back on. 
Then a few seconds later it happens again and then again each time getting closer 
to the last
until it finally goes off and doesn't come back on. I rolled to a stop barely 
on the edge
of the freeway. Until you have sat in your bus with cars and trucks blasting 
by you
at 75 mph 18 inches away you haven't known real fear. The tow truck driver 
wasn't
real happy there either. I never saw a tow truck driver work so fast.
   After that second failure I gave up on Pertronix and went back to points. 
I have
never been stranded because of point failure. If you use Pertronix be sure 
and carry a
back-up set with you.....
