Subject: Re: Distributor options for 1972 bus(stock 1700 motor)

In my search for a ditributor that would run well with my dual Dellorto's I
ended up with an 050 centrifigul advance unit.  It runs much better than the
relatively new 009 it replaced, but not exactly perfect.  With the 050 I now
have a barely noticable hesitation when I hit 2nd gear instead of the standard
009 1st gear hesitation.  However, that may be a problem with my novice
attempts at carb tuning.
I contacted the tech guys at aircooled_dot_net about the SVDA and here was their
reply,

&quot;The SVDA unit is very dependent upon the vacuum signal the engine and carbs
are providing. Basically, it's a measure of engine load.
In order to tell you if your engine has the PROPER signal, we would need to
know the vacuum readings at idle, and part throttle (steady rpm of about 3K
is fine). THEN we can tell you if the SVDA is the right choice for you.

I never sent them the requested information, but you may want to give it a
shot.

&gt; Do the www.aircooled_dot_net SVDA dizzy that has been spoken of as of late.
&gt; Reading through his tech pages leads me to beleive that this is not the
&gt; correct carb for the 1700 type4 motor and the 010 works better for my
&gt; application.
