Subject: Re: [T2] vw archives / Veneer

Have you guys checked your local Lowe's or Home Depot or other big hardware 
home center type place? Seems like we saw some very close matches. I have 
not gotten to that next step in my van's restoration so I haven't verified 
the pattern and color.

&gt; &gt; After going through the type2 VW archives, i found some discussion on 
&gt; veneer
&gt; &gt; replacement, but the only leads for places to buy new veneer that matches
&gt; &gt; the westy interior (77 bus) were cabinet makers. has anyone out there 
&gt; struck
&gt; &gt; gold on finding the &quot;perfect match&quot; for old westy interiors?
&gt;
&gt;Jeremy,
&gt;
&gt;Alas, as far as I can tell &quot;dark knotty pine&quot; is on the &quot;out&quot; list world
&gt;wide :-(  I searched all the manufacturers I could find a couple years ago
&gt;and had no luck even coming close.  The very closest I could come was a
&gt;medium teak, which had no knots and was way too green in tint.  At the
&gt;same time, even tho it is &quot;out&quot; in the U.S, I have always wondered if dark
&gt;knotty pine may not be the &quot;in&quot; style in some other country... Germny,
&gt;Britain, Australia, etc. etc.  If anyone finds this elusive stuff in any
&gt;sort of plastic laminate (formica), please, please post!!!
