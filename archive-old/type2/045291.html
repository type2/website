Subject: [T2] 71 T2 backup lights 

71 T2 backup lights - this is a pretty simple circuit.  Positive lead
from + side of coil goes to fuse holder to B/U light switch
on transaxle to backup light bulb socket to bulb to ground.
Troubleshoot without  starting engine - With ignition on and
shifter in reverse, are you getting 12V to both sides of fuse? to
switch? to bulb?   You could have a broken wire, bad switch,
blown fuse, bad lamp socket, bad ground connection at bulb.

What color wire and stripe are you talking about not connected on the
left rear light?  I don't have anything disconnected on
mine.  Wiring diagram is available online at  www.vintagebus_dot_com.   It
doesn't print very well, but is OK on screen.
