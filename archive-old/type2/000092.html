Volks,

  I needed a salvage part and headed out to the reccomended place in Denver 
named Blakes Foreign Salvage and maybe there are salvage yards like this all 
over the country but I ran into over 120 busses of all vintages and a ton of 
great parts They even had a bus with a bug attached to the top as someone had 
seen not to long ago
 If anyone is having trouble finding parts this place could be the answer.
