&gt; &gt; Looked through the archives on this and didn't find anything.  I'm looking
&gt; &gt; for someone that is experienced with installing an Espar heater.  I have a
&gt; &gt; complete one that came with the last bus that I purchased and would like to
&gt; &gt; get it installed.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If it is a BN 4, I have a heater book with all the templates on where to put

I have all the info on the BA4 (sorry not on line) but will send you a
copy if you need it for that one, which is less common than the BN4 or BA6
