Subject: AK!! My throttle stuck in FLOORED position, 78 Westy!

Dear Volks,
My throttle on my 78 Westy has seemed a bit sticky the last month or two. 
Step on pedal to the metal, release, and sometimes there would be a little 
hesitation before the pedal rebounded. Remembering past threads, I pulled up
the carpet and cleaned a big handful of sand and crud out from under my gas
pedal. Lubricated the thing, and the moving parts under the pedal. Then I
readjusted the linkage where it meets the throttle (this is an automatic
trans). This requires removal of a little c-clip that holds pretty strong
spring in place on the throttle linkage.I also cleaned the sping and parts
on the throttle lever with carb cleaner and made sure everything moved freely.
 Put it all back together and drove to dinner with my lovin' wife.

I stomped hard on the gas at one point, to see if I'd cured the stick, and 
IT STUCK. Pedal is now limp on the floor. Pulling it up by hand has no effect.
I am accelerating full tilt down a big straight piece of Hollister
Ave.with light traffic. Stomping hard on brakes contains my speed, but 
throttle is on runaway now. I put it in neutral and engine immediately begins 
racing. I pull over, park, run to the back of the bus, and find my engine 
spewing exhaust like those ones in the engine blow display at a Volks show. I
try pulling the throttle back by hand and the C-clip comes off (or maybe it's 
already gone?) and the engine continues its countdown to oblivion. I yank the
main wire to the coil and it all stops. Whew!

In the calm that followed (and few minutes of remaining daylight), following
things occurred to me:
1- I could have just turned off the key. Doh!
2- I couldn't find the tiny c-clip.
3- JEEZ! But for a 25 cent c-clip, could I have lost the whole thing.
4- What the ****?!?! How am I going to fix this? Was the clip already off or
did it come off when I tugged on the throttle? I couldn't tell in those frantic
seconds.
5- Maybe the throttle linkage is displaced to the side and rubs against the 
hole in the tin it must pass through when on full? 

Any good mechanics out there? Maybe it's just the clip. Maybe I need to better
adjust the other linkages on the auto trans? This ever happened to anyone anyone
knows? 

It was kind of scary. As Shanna says,&quot;I'm glad this happened while YOU were 
driving, babe.&quot; Whew. Me too.Every time I think I've finally got this beast
together something like this happens to shake my confidence.

I'm all ears,
Surfer Bob
