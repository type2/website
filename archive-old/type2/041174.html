Subject: Air Scoops Needed

Dear Fellow listees,

    I (Yucel Kuday) am looking for a pair of Air Scoops for my 75 bus so 
that I may rest alittle easier when heading out on my Cross country trip 
this year.  If you or anyone you know has got a pair laying around for sale 
please let me know, it would be greatly apreciated.  E-mail me direct at 
Kuday1_at_hotmail_dot_com or post a response on type2 I will get it. I check the 
list daily.

Peace

Yucel

75 Westy  BAM-BAM
