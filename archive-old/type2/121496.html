Subject: Re: [T2] Type2 Gas Mileage

&gt;I do have one logistical question about fast food fryer oil, though...
&gt;As I recall, most of the big chain fast food places use hydrogenated
&gt;oil in their fryers, so that it can be used longer before it breaks
&gt;down.  However, I thought that hydrogenated vegetable oils were solid
&gt;at room temperature (like animal fats)... which brings me to my
&gt;question... how does one handle this?  Or, do you just have to make
&gt;sure you find *good* fast food places? :-)

It's not that simple. There are a couple BIO-DIESEL lists you can subscribe 
to. They have the &quot;refine&quot; it before they can burn it. It's not as easy as 
pulling up to the back door of the local McD's and filling up - at least 
not what I read on those lists.

These folks have what I understood to be a still (as in moonshine) where 
they don't exactly distill it like 'shine but filter it and mix in a few 
other things to help it stay liquid. I also noticed that some of them have 
to start their engines on regular diesel but later switch over to bio once 
the engine temps are up.

An easier all-weather solution would be a propane conversion or something 
like that. No at home refineries necessary! &lt;grin&gt; Fewer miles per tank too 
I've read. Lower cost still....

Surely though there must be a Bio-diesel FAQ someplace...
