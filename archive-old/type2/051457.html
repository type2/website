Subject: [T2] burnt oil smell, pushrod tube leaks, simply fixed??

Volks,
On my FI '75 engine (85,000 original miles, no rebuild) for sometime I 
noticed oil leaking down from the region of the cylinder heads which landed 
on the exhaust pipe/heat exchangers, caused a smell of burnt oil in the cab, 
and left oil drip marks under both sides of the engine. At first I thought 
it was the valve cover gaskets, but after replacing them with no 
improvement, I looked at the areas at the ends of pushrod tubes on the 
undersides of the cylinder heads and they appeared to be leaking oil. Before 
getting into the task of replacing the tube seals (after reading the fine 
procedure by Sean Bartnik), as I'm always looking for ways to avoid 
unnecessary work, I decided to try two things:
1. Rotate the tubes and push them back and forth axially to make sure they 
were firmly seated. Although some were stuck, a gentle rotation with a 
plier, being careful to aviod pinching the walls, freed them.
2. I contemplated the possibility that crankcase over-pressure might be the 
cause of the oil seepage. That's when I looked into the oil breather box for 
the first time in 25 years! That's the little black box on the top of the 
engine held with a bale wire. Inside I found it to be faily clean, but there 
is a very narrow orifice that allows blow-by and engine fumes to be fedback 
through a hose to the intake air tube. I cleaned out that orifice, checked 
the hose, and refitted the breather.
Interesting to me was that the next time I took the van on the road for 
about a 10 mile local trip the leaking had stopped! So I'm wondering which 
of those two two simple procedures did the trick, or am I fooling myself and 
will I find the dripping to return after a more high speed miles on the 
road? If it's fixed, I'll be surprised again to note that neither the 
owner's manual or the Bentley mentionned routine maintenance of the oil 
breather. Because I'm basically intimidated if something isn't listed or 
called for in print, I never had the gumption to look inside the breather.
Anyone had a similar experience, or am I, and the underside of the engine, 
once again &quot;all wet&quot;?
Roland
