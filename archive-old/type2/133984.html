Subject: re: 1971 Kick Panels

Kim; 

Ron's ABS kick panels (Bus Depot) are really nice. I thought I was
ordering regular kick panels, and when I unpackaged his, I was more than
pleasantly surprised. They are a very worthwhile upgrade from the original
crappy cardboard that kinks and frays every time you try and remove it.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I remember someone in Portland, Oregon awhile back had some nice black
&gt;kick 
&gt;panels for the bus for sale.  I bought one set and would like another....
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have these, if so, How much?
