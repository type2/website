Subject: heat exchangers.

Volks,

Does anyone have a source for heat exchangers on a 75 bus? I've got more
hole than exchanger and was hoping to not quite freeze through the
coming winter. I ran a quick search at samba, but didn't get any hits.
Am I correct in thinking I'm limited to a 74 or 75 exchanger for a
replacement?

Thanks in advance,

jack
