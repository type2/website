Subject: Re: [T2] AC in '74 Bus

David,

I have a friend that has been in the auto A/C business since we were
buddies in college.  Worked with him at VPC(Volkswagen Products Corp) in
Ft. Worth.  

Seems like the last timethe question of which refrigeraant to use came up, 
I called and talked to him about it.  I believe he said the same about 
Freeze 12.

When it gets to be time to actually fill the system, I will ask him again.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;What do you flush the evap and condensers with before they go back into service?
&gt; 
&gt; I know this one.  There is a special flush for this purpose.  
It is very expensive - about $40/gallon last time I checked.  
I simply blew this through my condenser and evaporator 
with compressed air, but I think A/C shops have a 
machine that circulates this stuff through instead (a much better way to do it, I'm sure).

&gt; Ouch.  Sorry to hear that.  I have used R134a and Freeze-12 in my bus.  134a works okay but Freeze-12 works better.  Some people seem to have an aversion to Freeze-12 because it is a blend.  After doing a bit of research, I am betting (my compressor) that it will work fine provided that Ester is used as the lubricant.  With mineral oil, I would not use anything other than R-12.
