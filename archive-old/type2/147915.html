Subject: Re: front brake trouble

 &gt;The right front seemed to &quot;lock
 &gt;up&quot;, squealing the tire. Did this twice. I'm not too
 &gt;hep on brakes, so what would cause this behavior? What
 &gt;should I be looking for?

Are your front tyres the same brand, inflation, wear level, etc? I had 
mismatched rear tyres (diff. brands) on a non-VW and the newer tyre would 
lock up under emergency braking.

Cheers,

Martin.
