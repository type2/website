 Karl, I looked at that card, and it says . . .
 constant vel. joint: 4.5 mkg
 / 33 ft lb.
 I have been torquing my CV joints to 25 ft lbs... Am
 I wrong in this instance??
 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a SWAG [scientific wild ass guess]:

I don't have the Allen or triple-square bolts laying
around to look at the hardness number stamped in the
head but....

Usually, Allen bolts are around 10.9 hardness, maybe
12.6 on the black ones?

Perhaps the triple-square are 14.6?

But the wrinkle is 77's are normally Allen [hex] and
the triple-square cam later. Most 79's were
triple-square and, unless someone put Allens in, all
Vanagons are also.

Perhaps VW upped the torqued value on the
tripple-square bolts?
