&gt;I am trying to troubleshoot a strong small of gas which comes when I fill
&gt;my tank over 2/3 full.    As far as I can tell, there is no direct leak
&gt;from the tank or filler hose.

&gt;Do I have to pull the engine to check this fully?

&gt;I own a 72 Type II.

&gt;Any help would be appreciated.  Private messages ok as well.


Radar,
I've had the same with my '77 last year.
The '77 has two flexible hoses on the way from the tank to the filler, where
there is another rubber.
I changed all three of them, it was possible without pulling the engine,
because the '77 has the service lid over the engine.
I layed down on my back over the open service lid, working with the left
arm through the little round hole on the passengers side, that leads from
the
engine compartment to the inner side of the filler tube. Working with the
other
arm was not possible, the arms hinges had the wrong form.
I think the '72 hasn't got the service lid.
It's been an extraordinary &amp;%*_at_$§ kind of work and my left arm looked
like having had a fight with Muhammed Ali afterwards.
Next time I will pull the engine, definitly.
When the tank is more than 2/3 full, one of the flexible hoses is always
under petrol, therefore if this one is no longer ok - it will smell. Change
them all at one time (nearly 50$, but really worth not to do it again for
another 20 years...).  And check out exactly all of the vent hoses at
that time!

Good luck
