Any listmember in need of 185/75R-14 (passenger--not bus or van) can have my
used ones for $10/ea. They (4ea-a set) have less than 1,000 mi. on them with
two having less than 300 miles. Plus I have a 5th tire in excellent
condition for free. All sold as a set. You can have all five for less than
the cost of one!! Listmembers only.

P-mail if interested. I'm located in Billings, MT. If nearby--stop by and
pick them up. Will consider shipping but will add to cost of tires.
