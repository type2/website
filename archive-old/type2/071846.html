Dylan wants to know how to.....

&lt;&lt;...I would like to get some info on how to drop the RPM down 
    a couple hundred rpm,....&gt;&gt;

Your '71 came with either a 5.375 or 5.425 ring and pinion with 
a .82 4th.  With the smaller Type I style motor in the heavier
Bus I recommend staying with 1st-4th as-is and concentrate on
changing the ring and pinion set.  I'd go for the '75 Bus 4.86 set
myself in this application as its pretty much a 'slip-fit' with the
rest of the stock components.  This will drop rpms at 65 mph
to right around 3300-3400.   The old adage holds true here as 
well- &quot;Speed costs money, how fast do you want to go?&quot;  A 
good used 4.86 runs $350 or so just for the part not including
the labor to install.  For example a high quality aftermarket 4th
gear, such as a .77, will run over $250 for the part.  There are 
cheaper gears out there but you definitely get what you pay 
for.  I'd guess and say that if someone wanted me to do this ring
and pinion swap I'd est. that it would run $900-$1000 to do.  That
also includes a full rebuild on the transaxle as I'd have to completely
disassemble the gearbox anyway to install the ring and pinion.
Now, if you get very, very lucky you might find a good used 1975
transaxle with the ratios you want.  But chances of finding a good 
24 year old transaxle are slim.  But who knows?  You may get 
lucky!
