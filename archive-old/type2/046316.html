&gt; Now, this is a first for me.  Why would you want to move the battery to the
&gt; other side - to rot the other tray out too?

Of course! Then I will move it to the front of the bus with a long run of
cable so I rot out the floors :)&gt;

If there were something left to attach a jury rig tray to then I would have
already done that. A proper repair(welded in) is slated for a future date.

The resources(time, money parts etc) to do a proper repairs are not always
available when you need it. Sometimes it is necessary to effect a temporary
but satisfactory repair so the the bus(es) can stay on the raod serving the
real purpose which is transportation. My bus(es) are all I drive.

For example, the exhasut on the 67 sprung a leak two weeks ago. I did not
have the funds to purchase a new exhaust. I was able to barter a crisp
$10.00 to have another muffler off the scrap pile brazed up so I could keep
the bus on the raod. An additional ten dollars for hardware and my labor
kept the bus on the road. I know it wont last forever but It is quietly
serving its purpose 500 miles later. In the meantime funds for proper
repair(new muffler maybe even jet-caoted :) will be stockpiled.
