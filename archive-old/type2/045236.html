Subject: [T2] quiet pack and heat boxes

Salut la compagnie!

My bus, a 71, has a usual 1600 upright engine.  I have a recurent problem at
the connection between the fan housing fresh air hoses and the heat boxes /
heat exchangers.  Since there is a  sigle quiet pack header (from street
extractor family)  istead of a stock beetle exhaust, the little transfer box
or preheat box cant be install.  So I used a flexible silicone
hose -2inches- to run around the exhaust pipes and to joint the heat
exchangers.  But this solution isnt good as it tend to tear quickly and this
result in a lost af air flow and sometime is bad smell.

What is your solution?
