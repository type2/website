Subject: Starter bushing removal

Another issue.

My old starter bushing is incredibly stuck.

I have put a tap into it and now I can't get out either the tap OR the
bushing.

My weak girl arms notwithstanding, my husband can't get it either.

Could the grease have hardened to keep that thing stuck in there?  Would it
hurt anything to spray some sort of solvent in to dissolve it?  I have an
aerosol can of brake part cleaner that might work, but I don't want to wreck
anything.

Grrr.

Thanks for your help with the alternator questions, Richard  - I appreciate
it.  One more: how torn does that boot need to be to cause a problem?  Mine
is only slightly torn.  Could I just repair it with electrical tape and hope
for the best?


Thanks!
