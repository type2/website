&gt; &gt; the way i pulled the engine easist was that i put a cement block under the

&gt; 
&gt; And if you are stuck after you've taken the bolts off, remember that the
&gt; engine has to be pulled towards the back of the bus to slide it off the
&gt; transmission. It's not a surface-to-surface attachment! This is where the
&gt; problem comes in when you put it back together this way - lining up the
&gt; transmission and engine correctly because the engine has to be 'inserted' at
&gt; an angle and slid just right or the clutch with get out of alignment and you
&gt; have to start all over again.

now of course this is for a manual tranny, the auto tranny has a very
different removal prochedure,  I highly discourge taking both off together
for a couple reasons
.  the auto tranny is VERY heavy and combined with the engine you are
pushing a few hundred Lbs.
.  the auto tranny does not have the tranny shaft that the flywheel has to
clear so it doesn't need to be pulled back as far, and it doesn't have
quite as much alignment problems as the manual
.  the auto shift linkage is a real PITA to adjust

&gt; &gt; the tranny and engne together was a pain in the butt for one thing only for
&gt; &gt; me and that was the rusted cv joint bolts... i cant stand haveing to take
&gt; &gt; those dad blame cv joints and axles off./... i repalced all the cv bolts
&gt; 
&gt; There's also the issue of getting to the CV bolts. Unless you have a patient
&gt; friend with you at that point, you have to loosen a couple on one side, then
&gt; the other, then disengage the parking brake, rotate the cv axles, engage the
&gt; parking brake, do a couple, more, lather, rinse, repeat. Whenever I do this by
&gt; myself I never feel confident that I actually got them all torqued down (so
&gt; many bolts, so many turns, they all look the same...)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i have owned a bus for a little over a couple of months now and so far have
&gt; &gt; dropped my engine once and my engine and tranny together twice...

now I pull and replace the engine in my 78 solo when it needs to come out,
but I don't take it out unless it really needs to come out.  I bought a
transmission jack and made a cradle for the engine so this really makes
engine pulls fairly easy.
