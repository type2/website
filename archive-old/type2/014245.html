Subject: Carpet vs. Linoleum

Was wondering if one was better then the other?  I am putting a
Westfalia interior in my bus so was wondering if I should use carpet
or linoleum (with the carpet I probably will just lay it down on the
bus floor, with linoleum I would put a thin piece of plywood down and
the glue the linoleum to that) or is this just a personal preference? 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Kevin
