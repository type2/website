Subject: Re: [T2] Great North American Extreme Bus Race

I agree, time and money are the real problems.  Leave of absence, maybe?  But then you'll need sponsorship to make up for the lost income.  Still sounds like fun, though.  Cheers...KR

Why is it people on this list are afraid to drive their buses?  A  
5,000 mile trip is not that big a deal if your bus is in good shape.

I would do it tomorrow if I had the time and $$$ available.  
Unfortunately I have a day job and a family with kids in school. And  
of course 5,000 miles is only the race itself; Even if you lived  
right on the route itself you still need to get to the start point  
and home from the finish. So it's a 10,000 - 12,000 mile trip, really.

But what the heck: Team Pottsfamily_dot_ca is now looking for sponsors. I  
need to raise about $15K for the trip. With any luck we'll be home in  
time for BOTC. Interested parties can P-mail me for the address to  
send that cheque; I'll make sure their logo is well advertised  
throughout the trip.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
