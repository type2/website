Subject: Re: [T2] everybus signage?

Hi Jamey,

When you get close pull over. Wait about 5 minutes until a  bus goes by 
and follow it in.

What are the odds that a bus in that area *wouldn't* be going to 
EveryBus??

Or if you have a GPS you can use these coordinates:
Lat: 35.9533539 Lon: -79.7320557


Happy trails,
