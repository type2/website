Subject: ANOMOLY ALERT!! Re: New oil -&gt; Old oil

&gt;Last month, I changed the oil / filter, 1,000 miles ago.
a major oil leak.....I lost oil...one quart/50....Westy put to bed next day

&gt;Yesterday...seal replacement...oil was clear as new.  
&gt;Transparent.  changed last month.

&gt;PRT seal replacement, removed filter.  Oil was BLACK!! 
new oil filter, added oil.
&gt;
&gt;This morning, easy drive....13 miles.
&gt;
&gt;checked oil...oil is DARK, not clear....oil in pushrods BLACK...did not
drain pushrods. I should have, though.)

Good procedure to fill the pushrods with clean oil on assembly. Provides
lube to valve train MUCH quicker upon initial startup. They just need to be
checked for blockage and cleaned. Check your valve gaps. If one of them has
had poor lube it will be wide from excess wear. That's not likely 'cause
long before full blockage she will start tap tap tapping at ya in a few
miles. 

&gt;
&gt;What happened??  If my oil did not change color over 1,000 miles, how is it 
&gt;that it changed color to DARK in just 13 miles today??
&gt;Where was this oil hiding??  Did I have something blocking my oil flow??  
&gt;(The engine ran smooth, as always, no lifter noise, etc..)

Barry, I must say I am mystified (the science a'goin' on escapes me). Ergo,
I can only speculate on what we do know. There is only two ways I can think
of that you can run 1000 miles and the oil not have at least a tinge of
opacity. 1. Adequate change interval (detergent package never overloaded)
2. Some one changed it the night before without your knowledge.

Tell us of your change interval over the last several years, or since the
last motor assembly, and the type of use, commuting distances, ect.

What brand filter? If not OEM, 90% chance that's it. That's a biased
impression, not a calculated probability.

Type and weight of oil?

Before the leak, rate of oil use?

How long since you pulled the screen and had a look? Look and tell us of
anything good, bad or ugly.

Any hint of a glow from the oil pressure light at idle?

Before going further, do pull the bypass plunger and spring for a looky lou
to rule out a stuck plunger or broken spring. We know the pressure
regulator is probably ok, because otherwise the motor would have self
destructed. But check it any way. That it was running clean and smooth and
not rattling is proof that oil pressure is available at all critical areas.

There is only one way I can think of that the oil in the crankcase can be
transparent clean and the the oil in the filter is black. No flow through
filter. That's why I said check the bypass plug.  But it would also mean
that the last oil change you never changed or drained the black
oil????????? You didn't leave that part out, did you? No, of course not. 

That's why I must declare this an ANOMOLY ALERT. Without positing a new law
of physics, I'mmagonahafta percolate a little bit. At this point, not
running the motor except for limited testing until the anomoly is found is
most reasonable and prudent.

Ah, I just thought of an explaination. This is a T-II motor with an
aftermarket oil filter installed. If that be the case, the only experiance
I have is in removing them when replacing the broken motor, so any
strangness in the lubrication system could be explained by such non spec
modifornication.
