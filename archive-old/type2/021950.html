Subject: RE: Cylinder head Temp - How hot is too hot?

I recently installed a CHT gauge on my 71 Westy (1600 DP doghouse).  My
normal temperatures observed during this summer's trips were:

Coasting down long hills ~200 to 250
Idling ~250
Std In Town Driving ~300
Steep Long Hills at speed ~325
Highway speed on level road ~300

The difference could be due to the more efficient doghouse cooling system on
my bus (looking forward to other listee's comments), so, the temperatures
you report do not necessarily seem out of line.

I took my (new to me) 68 Westy on its maiden camping
trip this weekend.  Prior to the trip, I installed a
cylinder head temp gauge.  What is the standard temp
range for my engine?  Below is a list of my observed
temps.  Am I running too hot?  If so, what should I
look for in order to get the temps down?

Coasting down long hills ~300
Idling ~325
Std In Town Driving ~350
Steep Long Hills at speed ~380

I live in Colorado, so avoiding steep long hills will
be impossible...

p.s.  The bus was great for camping and did pretty
well on the &quot;jeep trail&quot; that we took it on to get to
our rock climbing destination.

Thanks,
Brad Baker
