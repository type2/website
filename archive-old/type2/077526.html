Subject: Re: Vehicle in San Diego needed - HELP!

Hi Gang,
	I'm looking for a favor from San Diego.

I'm coming into town in a few weeks, and bringing the family.  This =
is sort of a business trip, as I'm a research scientist and its a =
convention, but I'm a post-doctoral fellow which means there is no =
money to help with my expenses.

I need a vehicle to run the family around town, but cant realy =
afford to rent a minivan.  Hence my need for a favor.

Does anyone have a bus they can lend me between Nov 6 and 17th.

My insurance will cover me, I'm a responsible 35 year old with lots =
of VW experience, and I'm staying around town so there wont be lots =
of miles to cover.  Some money can definately change hands.

Can anyone help.

Thanks

Mike
