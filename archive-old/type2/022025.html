&gt;&gt;if the shifter on a 72 bus suddenely stops shifting
&gt;what might be the problem? it's connected at the front
&gt;and also at the back, the coupler is intact and the
&gt;part that connects the rear shift arm to the gearbox&lt;&lt;

Also I found that the 72 has 2 couplers in the back, in line with each other
maybe one is new and the 2nd one is shot? Just an idea.
