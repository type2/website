Subject: [T2] Blue Smoke and Power Loss

Hey folks...
       I was tooling down the highway doing 65 (with some folks WAY too
close behind me) when I felt a slight loss of power...about half a mile
later I noticed LOTS of blue smoke coming out the back...pulled over
immediately and hopped out to see what's up...lotsa smoke, dipstick was OK
to touch, not burning up hot like I expected, but a few more oil drips on
the ground than usual (on the left side)...let her cool, then checked
oil...oil level OK, started back up to the next exit (half mile away) to
turn around, trip cancelled :(  and limped her back home...Archives offer
mixed opinions, but I think it's oil in the combustion chamber from a leaky
valve, although it may running too rich too (having fiddled with the carb
before starting out--shoulda left well enough alone)...tomorrow morning she
gets a valve adjustment and I'm hoping that's all it is...I'm not normally a
praying man, but as this is home as well as transportation, I might just
start! Wish me luck and I won't refuse sympathy either...
