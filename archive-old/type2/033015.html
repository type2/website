Subject: Re: 71 gas caps obsolete?

This reminds me of when I had a '72 years ago, we came out of church one night
and the front turn signal lenses were gone. I could not believe someone would
steal something like signal lenses. Well, I went to the local VW dealer and
found out why! $50 to replace them! This was in 1985 too. I guess not all VW
enthusiast are &quot;good&quot; guys.
