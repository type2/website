Words fail me.

Well, not completely.

VW should just take a page from Fender and Gibson (guitars) and go 
straight back to the vintage design, put the engine where Toyota and 
everyone else do, engineer some crush into the front, and basically be 
done with it. I saw the green and white 23-window on &quot;That 70s Show&quot; 
last night and thought, jeepers, that looks perfectly modern.
