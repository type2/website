heater hoses??? if they are not blocked, but missing or damaged, how will
this cause overheating, the air will still cool the engine, even if it
gets lost afterwards.

in my case I have totally removed my heating system, including heat
exchangers,  I have a temp and presure gauge, and there was no significant
difference, what little difference there was, was down..the engine runs
ever so slightly cooler.


agree with everything else,
