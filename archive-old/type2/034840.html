Any good outdoor store sells (or can order) quick-n-easy brackets that you
can put a steele tube on or bolt up 2x4's to.... I use mine to haul around
canoes. :)
These guys don't advertise them but if you give them a call, I bet they
would sell you a pair and ship them to you. I think the total cost for 4
brackets would be less than $50 but thats a guess...
