&gt;&gt; I've got a brake bleeder with a one way valve, it is cheap and DOES

&gt; 
&gt; Everyone says &quot;a lot easier&quot;, but I'm wondering how it would even be &quot;possible&quot;
&gt; without a special tool.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm on a pretty depressing adventure still, and all I need to do to my bus 
&gt; is bleed the brakes.  The bleeder valve is broken off in the wheel cylinder,
&gt; way too deep to get it out.  The wheel is attached to the hub with a 46mm
&gt; nut, and nobody seems to sell a 46mm socket :-(  Except mail order, and harbor
&gt; freight just sent me a letter that said they could not fill my order...
&gt; NAPA told me they had a 1 13/16, but when I got to the store I found out
&gt; they lied.  Sears has a 3/4&quot; set that they sell for $200, which might be a 
&gt; good investment.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't really know what will happen once I get the nut off; I have a 3-arm 
&gt; screw-type puller, but it will push on the spindle, and I'm afraid that will 
&gt; just push the CV joint in, and not pull the brake drum off.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not that I mind this kind of work, it's just astonishing that I live in
&gt; a city with 2 million people and twice as many cars, yet nobody can sell me
&gt; a !_at_#$% 46mm socket.  Anyway, can anybody speak for the quality of the tool
&gt; sets from JC Whitney?  I would much rather get the $200.00 craftsman set than
&gt; find out that the $60 JC Whitney tools are bunk, even if it means ANOTHER
&gt; week that my bus is parked because I can't bleed the brakes.
&gt; 
&gt; In desperation, I tried to bleed the brake lines, starting from the rear
&gt; passenger, then did the rear driver by just unhooking the line and sort-of 
&gt; bleeding it, then the front passenger, then the front driver, but I was never 
&gt; able to get any pressure there, after a couple of hours of tries.
&gt; 
&gt; Man this is frustrating...

The gist of it is, there is a tool that is about 1/2 thick with a 
46mm hex cut out in it with a square opening for a breaker bar, and a 
flat side for bashing also.  Relatively inexpensive, usually 
available at VW parts places.  I still carry mine even though I haven't 
had a bus that needs it for over 12 years.

For a broken bleeder valve, get another cylinder, or try to use an easy 
out to remove remainder.

Before I got the 46mm tool, I went to Midas Brakes as they advertized 
a free inspection.  Ah ha I thought, THEY have to remove the 46mm for 
the inspection, it'll be loose after that, and then I can do the 
work.  The upshot is that they buggered the threads, and I spent half 
a day in their shop filing the threads to be able to re-assemble.

For bleeding, get a length of clear tubing and place over bleed valve 
and end in a glass jar with extra fluid in it.  As you let up on the 
brake the suction will bring up fluid in jar, not air.  A second 
person to pump brakes as you tighten/release bleeder is real nice.  
The check valve eliminates the second person.
