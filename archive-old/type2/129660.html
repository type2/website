That would be what I am looking for. I was hoping that someone would have some
experience with this type of mattress. Did you cover the firm foam with
anything a little softer, like a egg crate foam or anything like that?

Corbett,

Did this on a 67 split years ago.  Had a roomate at the time that promised
to sew covers for whatever I needed.  I bought 5&quot; or 6&quot; foam at an
upholstery store.  Thicker is better, but it needs to be *firm*.

Basically I covered the floor and part of the split between the seats with
three separate squares(rectangles) to make up the bed.  Contoured pieces
are horrible to try and make covers for.

I never slept better in my life!!...of course I always sleep better at the
beach&lt;grin&gt;.

Cheers, dave

what

&gt; size and shape, so it will need to be something that I can cut and shape.

&gt; Anyone have any ideas? What are the stock cushions in a bus made from? Some
&gt; kind of foam, but what thickness would be comfortable?
&gt;
