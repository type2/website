Subject: [T2] warped flywheel? on 76 bus

miles tells me that he has never experienced the jumping and shakeing in first gear in a bus except with the subaru's and that the flywheel could be  warped?

Can this be possible? 
how hard is the flywheel to change?
is it just the matter of unbolting it and bolting the other back on or what?
is this the best diagnosis of the shakeing and all even though it makes good sense.
Cha
