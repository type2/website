Subject: Re: Van on I-83 today

As I got on at exit 13 South of I-83 this Wed afternoon about 5 I find
myself merging in front of a late model dark Blue and white bay with a
wreath on the front... we played hopscotch admiring each others wheels for
about 15 mile then both exited at exit 10, I whipped into the Long John
Silvers for a fish the other van which followed me kept going into York
PA.

Any one from the list?!?!?  I had the Bright Blue and White 78 being
hauled around by the canoe.
