Subject: Re: [T2] Modern day CD player into our Bay windows??

My '79 dash is uncut and doesnt have any round holes, my CD player fit right 
it with very minor work..

Collie

&gt;Wrong ... If your dahsboard has not been cut yet, it has a small 
&gt;rectangular
&gt;center opening and two round holes for the volume and tuning knob.
