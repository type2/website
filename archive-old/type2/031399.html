My previous post got a few responses that is leading me toward an
alternative methed of heating my '78'.

Has anyone installed one of the Carver Model P4 Proane/Butane heaters?
I found one for $700.  

Is that a reasonable price?  

Where would I find other sellers? 

Do you like yours?  

What about the typical water vapor icing the windows problem with propane
heaters?

Thanks,

~Mars
