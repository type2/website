Subject: auxillary fuse block wiring

Just  trying to get everything in order to hook up dual battery relay, and 
need some advice on an auxilary fuse block.  My (not so) FLAPS had two 
different types: one real nice looking with 4 spade connectors coming out 
each side and a lid - $15, the other $3.50 with 4 loose metal clips and a 
solid band of 4 others rattling around inside the box.   No instructions on 
either package, so I asked around - Nobody knew anything about wiring, not 
even the other customers.  So I left empty handed.

My question is, Right now I have a positive lead coming off the battery, 
going toward this fuse block, but how does the fuse block allow me to 
&quot;energize&quot; all four other leads?  On the $15 one, from all appearances, none 
of the spade terminals connect in any way.  I must be missing something here. 
 I've re-wired 2/3 of my house from the breaker box on out, but cannot seem 
to wrap my brain around any electrical stuff in the bus.  

One more very silly thing:  If I wire my stereo into this new block, does 
that mean I will have to remember to turn it off everytime I park my bus? 
Believe me, I'm laughing at myself for even asking.

Thanks, Don
