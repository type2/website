Subject: Re: [T2] Squeeks and brakes

&gt; Question 1: Ashley ('71 Dormobile) has a squeek, more of a squeel perhaps
&gt; that I can hear when I take my foot of the accelerator and have my window
&gt; open. Isn't brake or clutch related and seems worse after a run than when
&gt; standing but is intermitant. I can't make it happen on the drive and can't
&gt; hang out of the back to look in the engine compartment when I am driving !
&gt;
&gt; I suspect that it is coming from the dynamo, possibly a bearing run dry.

If it is the generator it should be the same regardless if you are moving.
leave the engine on and go round back and listen.

&gt; Does this make sense ? How bad is this ? I took the front of the pulley off
&gt; but couldn't get the back bit off - does it come off or is it built in ? If

It is just stuck. It slides on and has a small woodruff key to keep it
from spinning on the shaft.

&gt; I am correct, I assume the dynamo has to come out, how big a job is this ?
&gt; T1 Engine.

Requires an engine pull unless you are a creative contortionist/masochist.

&gt; Question 2: How easy is a conversion from single to dual circuit brakes ? I
&gt; already have later disks on the van and have replaced all the components

Are you sure its not dual circuit/disks just boosterless?
