Subject: RE: [T2] Natural Bus route info

I am heading from Norfolk va, and Mark Dearing recommended from I64 take
rt29 to rt130 and that way I will not hit any mtns.I have never gone this
way but I will this trip and I trust Mark on this too.

The 501 out of Lynchburg is a very slow drive, very windy, LOTSA hills and
trucks too....I have travelled this road many times, its fun, but I81 would
be a
faster route for sure.

Lynchburg to the 81 is about an hour taking the 501, FWIW.

Collie

&gt; Alternate from Greensboro, NC could be US 29 to Lynchburg, VA and
&gt; pick up US- 501 to Glasgow and then take the &quot;black line &quot; on the map
&gt; that cuts over to Natural Bridge. This is uncharted territory for me.
&gt; Has anyone taken this route or familiar with these roads. I am trying
&gt; to determine of I will encounter worse hills the the usual route. I
&gt; have to cross the Blue Ridge somewhere and Roanoke is fairly benign
&gt; but I hate the interstate in the bus...........
