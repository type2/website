Subject: Rear shock removal -- How-to

In a message dated 96-10-08 09:24:45 EDT, you write:

&gt;Hey folks,
&gt;Anyone know of a good way to get the bottom bolt out in order to remove my
&gt;shocks? Is there a good puller for this?  The top ones came out easily
&gt;enough, but the bottom ones will hardly budge with a socket.  They are
&gt;currently soaking in oil.
&gt;
&gt;

Ned,

Your message is not clear.  On some buses the front shock's lower 'bolt' is
actually a stud.

However, if you're talking about the rear shock lower bolt...  The bolt,
which is a Grade 8 puppy, passes through the forged steel axle carrier.  On
installation of the shocks these bolts are supposed to be coated with grease
or anti-sieze compound, with a generous layer under the washers.  The object
is to keep water from wicking into the space between bolt &amp; forging.  If
moisture gets in there, the bolt will rust.  And if the water contains any
salt, the bolt will rust-weld to the forging making it very difficult to
remove.  (In the GODs -- Good Old Daze -- it was common practice to use sal
amoniac, salt or even urine (!) to rust-weld nuts to bolts in critical
applications, a primitive form of Loctite.)

In effect, the rust makes the bolt larger while making the bore smaller.  The
amount of force needed to break such a bond may exceed the strength of the
forging.  Best bet for non-destructive removal is to use penetrants and heat.
 It's also a good idea to locate replacement bolts BEFORE you start pounding
on the old ones.  Even if you get them out intact, if they are seriously
rusted you will want to replace them.  Don't count on your VW dealer to have
them in stock -- try an industrial hardware supplier or a truck dealer.  

There is considerable risk involved in using a torch to heat the rear axle
carrier (don't heat the bolt) so be careful.  A chatter gun will usually pop
the bolt free after an overnight soak with penetrant and a modest application
of heat of concentrated heat -- use a MAPP or acetylene torch; a propane
torch is too cool.

After getting the bolt out, do what you can to clean the bore in the forging.
 If you have access to gun-stuff a .50 cal. bore-brush makes a fine
de-rusting tool.  Once the bore is clean, PAINT IT.  (And stop laughing, I'm
serious.)  Use Rustoleum or similar 'Rusty Metal Primer' (ie, the red stuff).
 Swab the paint into the bore with a rag on a stick, really coat that puppy.
 

On installation of the new bolts &amp; shocks, use anti-sieze on the shank of the
bolt, keeping the threads clean.  Install the nut with Loctite and torque to
spec.  It's okay if the paint is still wet at the time you install the bolt.
 (The paint will not bond to the bolt because of the anti-sieze.)

Since this question keeps coming up I'm going to make this a general post.
