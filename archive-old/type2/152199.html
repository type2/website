&gt;  I need/am looking for a 2.0 liter engine for a 78 bus and also an automatic transmission (001).  I'm in the Maryland (D.C. metro) area and was wondering if there was anyone local that may have either of these items.   Thanks!

you need a .010 auto transmission from a 75-79 bay bus...also need the
flexplate and torque converter and shift cable.
