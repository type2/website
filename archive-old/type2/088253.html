Subject: Re: [T2] dual dellorto 36mm on a 78

What kind of 'mixed reviews'?
The FI works VERY well. Better than any carb system you could put on it.
Not sure how the smog laws work where you live, but here in Calif that would
be tampering. If you take the FI off, your next stop is the wrecking yard! You
cannot pass the bi-annual smog check.....

Don't listen to people that are afraid of it!

&gt; How well can I get a 1978 Bus engine running using dual dell 36mm instead of
&gt; running the FI. I have heard mixed reviews, thanks
