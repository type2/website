Subject: [T2] Push Rod Tube Removal

Hello everyone---Had a successful Engine pull---with the help of my friend 
Julio--I want to replace the Push Rod Tubes and Seals---but i am having 
trouble getting the darn things out---any helpful hints about getting these 
out---Dummy book says to gently use pliers and they come right out---well 
they dont seem to be coming out---I have 71 1600 DP engine---that is out of 
the car and the underneath tins are off---Thanks for the help--Adam
