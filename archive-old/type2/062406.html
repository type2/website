Subject: Change the stats---79 Deluxe

Well....Found what I was looking for Last night and bought it today.
I wanted and 80-82 Vanagon but instead fell in love with this.

1979 deluxe Westy(Refridge---stove--the whole bit)
New engine 1 yr warranty--Good local dealer
All new interior---I think Vanagon seats---Did 79's have captains 
                             chairs??--brown interior
New Paint--Dark Cream--kinda Beige
Air Conditioning--Did not want but has it
Automatic--This was my only concern---But runs beautifully
CB
Radio
All wood is perfect
OK--Here is the Kicker---63,000 original miles--UNBELIEVABLE
$3900

More than I wanted to spend....but I think that I did well 
considering the condition the bus in in.  It was restored buy a guy 
who normally does porsches---He restored all but the engine and the 
guy i bought it from got it for his son.  The son took his first long 
trip and the engine blew up.  They put in a new engine a I just 
bought it with about 500 miles on it.

My wife drove it for the first time and loved it.  She does not drive 
stick so  this was a 1st for her driving the Westy because my 76 is a 
stick.

OK---Speaking of my 76---I will post another message...the 76 is for 
sale.
