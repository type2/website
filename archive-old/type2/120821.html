&gt; &gt;Muir recommends using a 009 when possible. I've been running a 009 in my 
&gt; '71
&gt; &gt;for well over 10 years. It runs great and I like the fact that there is one
&gt; &gt;less subsystem to maintain.
&gt; 
&gt; after you go from a 009 to some sort of vacuum assist you will wonder
&gt; why you ran the 009 for so long. When dialed in the 009 does a very
&gt; good job in the upright engines. and it's cheap :)

Hello Guys     The 009 works very well with certain engines, I have found 
that a lot depends on the carb system, Dual carbs work better with 009,050 or 031 
, the vacuum advance will also work .  Keep this in mind there never was a 
356,912 porche that ran a vacuum advance dizzy,  the 912E might have seeing as 
it had the type4 (914) motor. Why was that??  I remember at high country a 
couple years ago giving a tech talk with Steve Dolan and he was trashing the 009 
as he finished his talk I pick the 009 dizzy up and told everybody there that 
the thing to remember was that it would get you home, not quite right but would 
work, Right after that Nikki was going home to Cali and the Vacuum dizzy that 
she and Stevs had worked on so hard gave up the ghoost and what did she do  
Thats right old 009 time, got her home too. I am running all types of dizzys in 
my buses right now certain motors do better with the mechanical advace than 
others, Dual ports with stock 34 carbs seem to dothe worse .   This is just 
what I've seen I'll be interested in hearing others.  Later and have fun  Mark
