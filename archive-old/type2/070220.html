        Terry, 
        You write 'charge' in refernce to energy building up in the coil-
'charge' would be correct for the capacitor,  but for a conventional coil, 
the word you want is 'current'. As in:

Your first paragraph, edited: 

&gt;My understanding is that during the time the points are closed, the coil
&gt;[ current builds ] up to (hopefully) its maximum (or DC) current flow, 
&gt;which is only limited by the DC resistance of the coil and points 
&gt;(and any [losses] due to poor grounding or dirty terminals) and the 
&gt;voltage applied to the positive terminal of the coil.  During the time the 
&gt;points are open, the coil forces the spark, the duration of which is 
&gt;determined by the [current through] the coil and how long the
&gt;points are open.(1)
&gt;
&gt;So...you want the points closed long enough to [maximize] coil [current] 
&gt;and open long enough to fully (!discharge!) the coil. (2)

        My notes (1) and (2) on the 'dwell time' for open points...
my understanding is that the coil's magnetic field colapses very quickly
and that makes one nice spark and that's it. So 'dwell' as we worry
about it is the closed time of the points, when indeed current through
the points + coil starts small (limited by coil inductance) and rises
to its DC maximum. Open time of the points isn't really an issue, the
coil 'discharges' (the field colapses- there is no one word for this)
much quicker than it builds up.

        Sorry to sound pedantic, but there is a capacitor in the circuit
too and it DOES charge and discharge, 

        For propellor-heads, remember that capacitors and coils (inductors)
are complementary: current through a capcitor = dv/dt, (eg no DC current)
while voltage across a coil = di/dt (eg no voltage drop *due to inductance*
when current is steady- Ohm's law still applies, of course)

        Cheers!
        Bill
