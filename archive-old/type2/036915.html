Subject: Uh-oh... I thought a tune-up would _improve_ performance :-(

OK, I admit I'm new to this :-)

I'm going through the tune-up procedures in Muir (the only reference I
currently have), and have done the valve adjustments, points, and static
timing. I tried starting it up, to check my handiwork (cough...) and was
depressed to find that it made things worse! It'll start, but unless I
keep on the gas, it sputters and dies. 

I _think_ my problem is with the timing. My bus has a later AS engine in
it, and Muir's book doesn't give timing info on it. The pulley has marks
at 0, 7.5, and 10, but it was set at quite a bit further back when I
checked it before adjusment, like probably 12.5 to 15 degrees BTDC. I
changed it to 7.5, per Muir's footnote 5 on the timing chart.

The other thing to note is that my points setup didn't jive with the
description Muir gave - I only had one screw, not two, and could move
the entire assembly around to get the gap set (at .016, per the book). 

Any ideas?
