Hey all.

I concure. I used this procedure last winter and
found that the duct tape
actually leaves a messy patch of glue if you
remove them the following
spring.

This year I used magnetic forced air heating vent
covers you can
purchase at almost any hardware store. White/Brown
whatever, cut out
the vents shape and place over the rear vents on
your bus. This is also
great for storage and keeping snow and rain from
entering your engine
compartment.

I do drive with them on the HWY and they don't
blow off.  The suction
from the engine fan holds them on tight. At about
200 degrees take them
off for normal driving. WARNING! A slight hill or
any kind of added load will
shoot your temps up to 250+ in a matter of
seconds.

Formula: (Vent Covers + Oil Temp Guage) + Take
them off at 200 = Safe Driving!

Subject: [T2] Extreme Cold Driving


Last week I took Kermit my '76 Westy camping in
single digit temps.  Wind
chills were in the -20 degree range and Kermit
wasn't happy.  I have a VDO
oil temp gauge so I decided to get wild and crazy
with the remarkable wonder
we all call duct tape.  I completey (and neatly)
duct taped over the air
vents on the top back corners of the bus.  Before
taping the vents I was
running around 160-170 degrees, freezing in the
cabin, and Kermit was
running quite lousy.  After the duct tape the oil
temp went up to about 190
degrees, the frost on the windows dissappeared, my
feet thawed out, and
Kermit ran better than he had for two days.  A
friend and I cracked a head
on his '78 camper a couple of years ago on a New
Years Day kayaking trip to
the mountains of West Virginia.  The mechanic said
it was probabably because
the extremely cold weather never allowed the heads
to heat up properly which
is just as damaging as heating up too much.  Can't
say for sure because we
didn't have an oil temp gauge.  I do recall it
being too cold to keep frost
off the windshield.  I would encourage anybody who
drives in temps below
20-30 degrees to install an oil temp and use this
method.  I still have the
duct tape on and around town I still stay below
190 degrees.  Once it warms
up past 30 degrees I will probably remove a couple
of strips of tape from
the vents or untape one side completely.  I'm
probably not the first to try
duct tape for this, but I just wanted to let you
know my observations.  Good
Luck and keep warm.
