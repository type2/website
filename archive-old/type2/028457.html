Ah, Rick? Jake? Al? All you parking lot joke guys are pretty quiet ;-)
Interesting twist to the great longevity debate.

I'm sorry to hear about your motor Kendrew. I seem to recall folks at Rimco
(don't quote me I could be mistaken...flame suit on) telling me years ago
about VW not using the same sintered seats anymore and possibly justified it
thru the use of sodium valves. Jake prolly knows the score there. The diesel
seats and David's idea are a good approach.  However, even if you keep the
seats in thru brute force that doesn't address the cause which is our
common, old enemy...too much heat.

Can you tell us more about your oil cooler fan solution Jake?  I don't know
the setup but it sounds &quot;cool&quot;.  Are sodium valves still available and if so
are they advisable?

What were the AVP and MSHP &quot;fixes&quot;?

None of these.  Its a very common problem with type4 heads, abused or not.
Even to the point that various aftermarket companys have devised &quot;fixes&quot;
for the problem...AVP and the defunct MSHP come to mind.
