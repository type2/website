Subject: FS: 71 Campmobile real cheap SOLD!!

Thanks Surfer Bob on the tip on the 71.  It is original not a pop top and   
the cabinets look pretty good.  I went over last night and checked it out   
and wrote a check on the spot.  The engine looks all there but it was   
dark.  He says it is locked up but we shall see.   People at work think I   
am crazy but it is a good deal.   I now have a 71 weekender, 73 thing,   
 74 Westie, 86 Jetta GLI and a 71 BMW 2500.   If anyone wants a Free BMW   
for parts let me know, it is in Virginia in a barn and has the top sawed   
off but it runs.
Well I am now a multi bus owner!    Erick
