Subject: '77 Autobus Throttle Linkage ?

Okay folks now that my wiring issues are out of the way, I am on the next 
part that is missing. The linkage between the lever on the transmission and 
the throttle valve. I have found a few pieces. I am sure one is correct, but 
the spring I picked up at alocal VW shop seems like it might be too long.



Here is the Microfiche pic. look at the parts # 33-37. I have 33, 34 but 35 
is the spring that I have and I think it might be too long.

Here is what I have, I still need the C-clip and the pivot pin the shaft 
passes through. But I think getting the correct spring should be first due 
to the adjustment in the Bentley(Fuel Injection pg.30, Sec. 6.4). 
Apparentley this is why it will not idle or most likely why it will not 
idle.

I was thinking of using a Barrel Nut as the pivot pin. I would really like 
to get this linkage back together so that I can see my bus idle, now that I 
know that it will run. Who knows maybe I might get to drive her before 
Thanksgiving this year.

Short version:

Anybody know the length of the spring?
Anyone have any pics of their linkage assembled or disasembled?
Does the pivotpin have a lip on the top of it to stop it from dropping out?

Thanks,
