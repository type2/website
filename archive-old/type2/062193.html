Fellow volks folks,
I know many of you have more than one vw, so I'd like to ask for some 
advice. I have the opportunity to buy a 1970 bug convertible. It's an 
auto stick and I have no experience with this type of tranny. It has a 
new canvas, mild rust damage and needs a lot of trim work. The engine 
runs but is hard starting, you have to pump the gas to get it to go and 
then it doesn't want to idle for a while. The owner is asking $2500 or 
best offer. What do you think?   Anyone with experience with an 
autostick?  Please help.
                                                                     Steve
                                         '69 westy
