no big deal... the shaft can move, or at least I've seen em and had em
move like that and never had an issue.

&gt; I did get the spacer to go in but when I put the drum on the axle retreats and
&gt; there's no stub to install the axle nut... ???

just reach around on the back and hold it while putting the drum back on.
