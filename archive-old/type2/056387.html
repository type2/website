Subject: Arch*ves, &quot;Busted Bus&quot; -- (RE: oil temps (again))

The new on-line WWW Arch*ves have been working for weeks ...

   http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/

BTW, to all ... new arch*ve feature, go to:

http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/default.asp?search=IISindex

You can do a lot more complex searches and you also get ranks for best
hits.  With this screen, you can now do searches like:

  1) loaf AND NOT split AND brakes
  2) Brake** NEAR Convert**
  3) Yoko*
  4) (Yoko* AND 197*) OR (Yoko* AND 7*)

#3 has been the most requested feature, you can now search words with
wildcards!  Now you can catch all the various spellings of Yoko tires!

#2 is also very powerful.  A word with &quot;**&quot; at the end will match all
variations.  &quot;Brake&quot; will also do &quot;Brakes&quot;.  &quot;Convert&quot; will also match
&quot;Converted&quot;, &quot;Converting&quot; and other variations of &quot;Convert&quot;.

#4 Shows how you can combine these features.  In this case, it looks for
messages that have both words starting with &quot;Yoko&quot; and &quot;197x&quot; or &quot;7x&quot;.
So someone who said &quot;Yoko&quot; and &quot;1973&quot; would get a hit.
