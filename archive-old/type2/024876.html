Its not the carb that the .009 is incompatible with it, its the type IV 
engine itself.  If you have to run a dist. that lacks a vacuum advance unit, 
the .050 is much better suited to the porsche 356/912 engine and the VW type 
IV engine than the .009.  It is my understanding that it has an advance curve 
more suited to the engine's rod length.

The stock dist. will always run best, but you need to find a correct vacuum 
signal for it somewhere on the aftermarket carb.  I have a weber IDF that had 
a port installed for use with a stock dist.  I am not running it yet, so I 
have not the measured the vacuum signal it produces.
