Subject: [T2] Re: A little advise (sic) needed

&quot;missy:)&quot; asked about various bits and bobs needed for her bus.

Which got me to thinking about bus 'restoration' and what is needed, though 
she asked where to get specific parts and whether they were indeed 
available. As a &quot;grey beard&quot; who has owned busses for over 25 years, I 
suppose that the simplest answer is yes, anything is available, it just 
takes money and time. Preferably both, but one or the other will do.

The champion scroungers amongst us (you know who you are) will come across 
every part of that list for little or no cost and then post about it. (You 
may thumb your nose at those people.)
The rest of us mere mortals will scrounge for some and pay for the rest. In 
the olden days, when dinosaurs ruled the earth and pot was cheaper, all of 
that stuff was readily available in wrecking yards. Cheap. Plentiful. This 
is many years before Phish, by the way. Then the old busses went to the 
scrap yards and were turned into Hyundais. :(
Thesedays, we are lucky enough to have the Bus Depot. It weren't always so 
easy.

So then, missy:) asked: (and I answered)

Q:--pop-top canvas-everyone claims there's is the best. i don't want the
original color, because everyone knows that orange or tan become an
enormous light bulb in the morning. i would settle for something plain and 
dark.
A:These are not that easy to make, and annoying to install on the best of 
days. Use your old one as long as possible.

Q:--front door kick panels-i'm sure i can't get these in the orange color
anymore, unless they are used...or can i?
A: You can buy these in less citrus-like colors, which is advised, or you can
recover your old ones easily with the garish color of your choice

Q: -front door seals-these are why i need to replace the kick panels.
A: Not cheap at all, but worth it. Don't buy the cheapest you find. Bus 
Depot's are fine.

Q:--sliding door seal, --pop top/luggage rack seal
A: Same as above. This is getting into serious money now.

Q:-various door handles/wdw. handles
A: Window cranks are easily substituted with cheap ones made for Rabbits, 
but there are varying degrees of quality and aftermarket manufacturers. I 
use an original for looks for the passenger side, but an expensive solid 
cast one (that doesn't flex) for the driver side.
Plenty of options. re: Door grab handles: I bought mine in the UK at German 
and Swedish parts, but I think that they are available from Bus Depot 
nowadays.

Q:--heater/fan controls-mainly knobs, but my friend told me (these are his 
words), &quot;the PO 'ripped' out any controls to all the vents EXCEPT the 
defroster...which blows all day every day, with no way to turn it off.&quot; so, 
i am unsure as to what else this may entail.
A: This sounds scary. Rest assured that the rest of us have 'issues' with 
these items too. Small knobs are best found in another bus on the same day 
that it is towed in for the last time. Keep an eye our for a dead bus (one 
with an Automatic transmission, for example) and buy it off of the previous 
owners for a couple hundred bucks and cannibalize it. Share cost and bits 
between your friends, save the transaxle for yourself, you will need it 
sooner or later.

Q:--mosquito snap-in nets-once again everyone raves about their own
A: They are wonderful to have, indeed. If you have a dog, be advised that 
your dog will forget about your lovely mosquito net while camping at around 
3:00am and go right through it in pursuit of Mr. Skunk or Mr. Raccoon. 
(Don't ask me how I know this.)
Once again, sure: you can make one, but it is easier just to look until you 
find one. Most people never use theirs, which means that they are in good 
shape and will surface eventually for sale used. Making one is easy, IF you 
have the die set for the snaps.

To sum it up (before I get thrown off the list): These things take time. I 
have been driving busses and collecting parts for over half of my life, I 
have a goodly enough income to buy something for my '71 Westy when I cannot 
scrounge it, and my bus STILL isn't done.
There is always something that it needs. It is kinda like painting the 
Golden Gate bridge. When they get to one end, the other end needs painting 
again. It is never finished. You gets to tinker on it for the rest of your 
life.
