Hi volks,

 I was _sure_ I'd seen some authoritative looking info on this topic
on the list before, so I wen't digging in the archives. I turned
up a post from Brian Verbeek (23/8/96):

15: For an even smaller price you can buy one of the Bosch RPM limiting
rotors
16: Steven Dolan described, here are some numbers:
17: 
18: 1 234 332 144  &gt;5400 RPM normally used in T4 engines
19: 1 234 332 192  &gt;4500 RPM normally used in 1600 Baywindows
20: 1 234 332 314  &gt;4800 RPM normally used in 1600 'Export' Baywindows
21: 1 234 332 207  &gt;5800 RPM normally used in 4-cyl 914s
22: 
23: You can select one of the above to fit your stock (either T1 or T4) or
009 
24: distributor. if you have a T4 in your '74 i'd recommend the &gt;5400, this
one
25: is also good for the performance oriented Bus owner who has a better
than stock
26: rebuilt engine with CW crank, for a stock 1600 i'd use the &gt;4800 or a
&gt;5000 from
27: another car, Saab maybe.

 So this suggests that the &quot;redline&quot; for a pancake should be a bit under
5400, as
the limiter is usually set a little higher than the tach. If I work the
numbers for
my '77 devon it comes in at 5000rpm = ~90mph, reinforcing the idea expressed
on
this list before that you can't overrev a baywindow in top gear without a
long,
steep hill and/or a tailwind!

Cheers,
	 W.
