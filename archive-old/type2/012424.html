Subject: web translator for foreign bus pages
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

hey volks,
none of my emails seem to be getting to the list but
ill keep trying.  i might be slow and behind the
times, but No Quarter(another listee) just gave me a
cool tip.  i know from time to time we find pages in
german and other such languages and rely on our
bilingual listees to translate.  well on
http://www.altavista_dot_com they have a translate section
where you can put in the text or web address and it
will convert it for you.  pretty cool i thought.  just
a tip for any of you as behind as me:)  obligatory bus
content:  i was using the page to translate a greman
article comparing a VW westy and a ford taunis transit
which looks a whole lot like a bus
