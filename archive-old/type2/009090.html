&gt; Actually, the way I always check for propane or natural gas leaks

joint.

I've been tempted to try this approach, but have so far heeded the
dire warnings of the gas suppliers who say _not_ to look for leaks
with an open flame.  I can imagine why, if you happen to find a leak
in an enclosed area (like the inside of a bus)! BLaaaMM!
