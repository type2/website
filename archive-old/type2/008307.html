&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt;  I want to ask some brake related questions. I have a 70 that is my
&gt; daily driver and a 73 parts bus. I want to pull all the brakes off the
&gt; 73 and put them on the 70. I have pulled the front beam off the 73 and
&gt; will referb it and install it as a unit on the70. I will have to get
&gt; an intake manifold with the port on the side for the booster. I will
&gt; also have to run a tube to the front for the booster. I will use the
&gt; master and the proportioning valve. 
&gt;  Has anyone ever done this. I plan to swap all the rear suspention to
&gt; keep the wheels the same all around. 
&gt;  The reason I want to do this is that 1. I have all the stuff for
&gt; free. 2. most of the stuff for 73-79 is the same and a lot cheaper
&gt; than the 71-72 stuff and the 70 drums stuff.  I don't want to have to
&gt; hunt around for the early stuff and pay the high prices. 
&gt;  I concidered keeping the rear the same but I would have to use some
&gt; wheel adapters to make it all work out.
&gt;  I know some will not approve of this modification, but I hate drum
&gt; brakes and am tired of fighting them, I want disks. In the end I will
&gt; basicly have a 71 bus mechanicly ( I allready updated the engine).
&gt;  Does anyone have any advice? (constructive)

You don't need a new manifold.  Just contour the end of a 1/2 inch
tube to match the OD of the manifold below the carburator and then
braze the tube into place.  Once the tube is brazed on all the way
around, drill inside the tube to open a hole into the manifold.

You could run vacuum hose all the way up to the booster, but it is
better and cheaper to mimic the tubing in the late buses.  There is a
SAE vacuum hose that is nearly identical in ID to the metric hose but
that is a lot cheaper.  You don't get the nifty fabric cover, though!

Swapping the late rear suspension is also a good idea.  You will love
the composite drums!
