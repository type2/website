&lt;&lt; I have one from the original list purchase, I don't believe it is the
P4 but they didn't change much.

FWIW we paid something around $400 then ('95??) because Tom
Forhan organized the import without profit as a group deal.  Lashley or
whoever does the tents has always sold them for a good bit more, as is
his prerogative for importing them, I didn't think he wanted that much
though, so I'd check him first.&gt;&gt;

Yes, Carver is no longer in business.  Truma GmbH bought them out last year 
and closed them down.  Took me for a bit of a surprise as Truma promised they 
would keep Carver going to at least 2 years.

The P4 was a bit more expensive as it was designed to meet higher standards 
for countries like Germany.  The P4 has more safety features as I understand 
it, though I am not familiar with the older Propex units.

Truma is still operating the Carver repair facility in the UK, and will 
continue to honor warranties and offer repairs as long as the parts stash 
holds out.  (however I wouldn't count on it for much more than a year or two)

I'll meet with Truma in a couple of weeks in Dusseldorf, and post when I get 
back.

The last batch of the P4s I had sold for $705ea., which included the mounting 
kit.  I offered a 10% discount to listmembers.  Keep in mind the Truma unit 
that will replace the P4 sells for over $1500.  I sold quite a few of these 
with little problems.  I had 2 units that went bad right away, and one other 
that went out after 1 year.  This is out of 50 units or so.  All problems 
were in the electrical boards, and did not result in any failures that were 
dangerous.
