&gt; What's so great about these Sears Craftsman??  Well, they are the READABLE
&gt; sockets, and you can actually see the sizes engraved on the socket.  They
&gt; use to be the Harley-Davidson special sockets.
&gt;
&gt;
I wonder what that says about the demographic of Harley buyers...;-(

Best line ever about current Harleys from an old Roxanne episode:

&quot;I buy old Harleys cheap, chrome'm up and make a fortune sellin'm
to dentists.&quot;
