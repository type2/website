Subject: [T2] windsreen wipers speed?!

have a 74 bus and only one speed on the wipers, on the arm there 
are more notches to move into but there is no change. the wipers 
only have one speed.

anyone suggest easy way to make more speeds like intermittent 
and hight speed

i have seen the wiper speed control add on in the auto shops, is 
that likely to work?
