&lt;&lt; There is generally no difference between the same grade of fuel from
different suppliers.  Fuel is produced to specification and no
refiner has any incentive to produce fuel that exceeds the specifications
markedly.  Fuel is so uniform that refiners routinely swap fuel with each
other, so that tank of upscale fuel you bought at the &quot;orange&quot; station
could well have been refined at the &quot;blue and silver&quot; refinery.

A friend of mine lives in upstate NY near the Hudson River...When the 
gas tanker docks, all the tank trucks load from it...
