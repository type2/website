Subject: VDO gauges, senders, etc. for sale

Update - the Tach, OT sender, OT gauge, OP sender and OP gauge are all 
tenatively spoken for.  Any takers for the wiring kits or hot start relay kit?

-David

p.s. The first sentence should read, &quot;I have here some VDO equipment...&quot; (I 
hate it when I skip letters!)


============================================================================
I have her some VDO equipment for sale.  I am selling it on behalf of our 
fellow listmember Jackson Burgess, who is by now probably on his way down 
into Baja California with his '79 Adventurewagen for some leisurely R&amp;R (I 
want his life).

This stuff was all purchased by Jackson from the Bus Depot (with 5% 
listmember discount) but for a host of reasons he decided not to install it 
and he would like to offer it to the list for a 15% discount.  I believe 
the guages are the Vision style.  All of it is BRAND NEW in the box.

Here is what I have:

DESCRIPTION                   PART#     BUS DEPOT PRICE   ASKING PRICE

VDO/Bosch WR1 relay kit                 ?????             15% off

Also:
Refrigerator thermometer, metal  Cost $6, sell $4

When it is all sold I will be sending the money so he can buy more fish 
tacos.  Prices do not include shipping, but I will ship USPS for actual cost.
