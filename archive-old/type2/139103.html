&gt; There are several Volvos in town with 300K MILES on them. My old Honda had
&gt; 250K miles on it when I last saw it. I am hoping for 300K miles out of all
&gt; of my current cars. They get cheaper to drive every year b/c the resale is
&gt; crap, repair costs flatten out (as long as I do the work myself), etc. Not
&gt; to mention I can get junkyard parts for my current commuters ('97 VW Cabrio
&gt; and '99 CR-V).

This topic has derailed badly.

What does any of this have to do with the fact that car companies make money
by selling new cars and obsoleting old ones through the elimination of
parts?
