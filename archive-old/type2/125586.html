Subject: Fwd: [T2] help with my auto transmission

Hi Bob,

If it's in PARK it shouldn't be spinning a wheel.

I think maybe the linkage is off a notch.

If I read the original message correctly,
PRNDL = What the stick says
RNDL= What the tranny is doing.

So the stick isn't getting the tranny all the way back to park. 
Something is too loose or too tight, and the adjustment is out of spec.

Disconnect the shifter linkage and manually shift the lever all the way 
back to park. Then connect the linkage and adjust it to read P at the 
lever. Verify that all the other gears are also reading OK, and you're 
good to go.


Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; starting the bus in park the rear tires starting spinning backwards 
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; the engine was over reving. we put the autostick into neutrol and the
&gt;&gt; rear tire started spinning into forward does anybody know what he did
&gt;&gt; wrong he said he hooked everything up the same way the old came down i
&gt;&gt; need major help please from the list if you don't understand my 
&gt;&gt; letter i
&gt;&gt; would be more than glad to call someone to fully understand what i 
&gt;&gt; need
&gt;&gt; to do to correct the problem.
&gt;
&gt; pretty much normal operation, there is a always just a little power
&gt; transmitted.
&gt;
&gt; work on the idle getting it down to spec.  about 950rpm
&gt;
&gt; if the bus is sitting on the ground and then it still does this then 
&gt; you
&gt; have a problem...
