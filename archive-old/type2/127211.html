Welcome to the wonderful world of rebuild opinions. The proper way
it to measure everything and replace what is out of spec. Lots of
people (myself included) just end up doing more than necessasary while
the engine is out instead of waiting. One thing I would do before
tearing into it is check the compression of each cyl and then right
after you pull the engine check the crankshaft endplay. These two
items are very good indicators of how much of a rebuild you need.

But to answer your question I would consider a decent rebuild to
entail: rebuild/new heads, new p&amp;c, new cam &amp; lifters, new crank and
rod bearings, case align bored if needed. Replacing the wires, coil,
condensor etc is basically a full tune-up, not a rebuild.
