&gt; Hi folks, with Cales positive comments about the SoCal outfit, I was
&gt; wondering if anyone has their catalogue or Latest Rages that they'd pass
&gt; along , as they will not ship them to Canada.

SoCal does not publish a catalog.  They say use their advertisement in the back
of mags.  At least that's what they told me about 6 months ago when I wandered
into their showroom.  They happen to be within spitting distance of my house
(1.5 miles or so)
