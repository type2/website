Before you start throwing money around get yourself a Bentley manual and
follow the procedure for adjusting the steering gearbox.  You MUST follow
the correct adjustment procedure.  If you don't the steering gear can
actually seize in mid-maneuver with disastrous results.

If the drag link and tie-rods check out OK, take a good look at the swing
arm assembly.  It is the culprit in most cases such as you describe.  Have a
helper move the steering wheel while you watch underneath to see what the
swing arm does.  This procedure/check is also in the Bentley manual.

While you're under there check the steering damper.  Looks [and works] just
like a shock absorber, but lying on its side.  Replacements are not
expensive and can make a noticeable difference IF the rest of the steering
components are OK.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  ...Could it be I need a new/rebuilt steering box? I read somewhere that
tight ball joints could cause this kind of problem too or am I taking the
bait?

...Sure would appreciate the collective knowledge and experience from the
group.  &lt;&lt;
