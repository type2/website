&lt;&lt;Also, anybody know a good source for buying tents for the westfalia campers
that look like the originals? I have seen new tents with many designs, but I
am interested in something that looks original.

Thanks,
Corbett&gt;&gt;

Corbett,

I don't know what you mean by original looking.  If you want an original 
style tent, you will need to find a used one.  The new tents we offer are 
updated versions of the old tents.  They use more current designs and colors.

I don't know of anyone who makes a vintage looking side tent.
