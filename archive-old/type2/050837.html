Subject: [T2] 64 30/31 PICT MISS?

Hi all,

I have a 64 sundial I have been putting back in service, and I have a miss 
in the acceleration.  From a dead stop idle when you hit the gas it 
hesitates really bad.  It is a 1600 sp, 009 dist. new plug wires and plugs 
timing ok, can I rejet it to a larger jet?  It acts like it is getting a 
swill of air when you hit the gas.  any help would be appreciated.

thanks,
mike
64 sundial, 71 daily
