Subject: RE: [T2] Upgrading to H4s

I have found two relays to be the best--one for the low beam
circuit--one for the high beam.

They do function better with two seperate feed wires to the hot lead to
the fuse box, and two seperate grounds, one to each relay.
10 to 12 ga wire is plenty good---and with 40 amp relays your good to go
up to 80 / 100 H-4's with no adverse effects

And actually it is a simple task--

Later,

Lastly, who sells the relays I should be using and what are they rated
at? 
There are lots of cheap relays out there. You can get standard 30-40 amp
relays at Autozone for a few bucks each. They are the small black cube
ones. Dunno if you would need two or only one - you should check the
current draw on the lights to be sure.
