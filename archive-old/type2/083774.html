Subject: [airs] troy moving back east

for those of you playing at home :) troy left my house about 8pm
tonite with a much stronger running engine with out any dropped
valves. we didn't get a chance to take a good test run, so if anyone
sees a lime green 78 pass bus broken down on the side of the road,
please give him a hand. I don't expect there to be any problems,
though. There will be a much better write-up from both of us on our
engine pulls this weekend (hint: one engine got pulled multiple times)
