Subject: Re: [T2] CHT Wows and Concerns

Thanks to all for your responses!  Here is some additional information and
answers to your queries.

&gt;&gt;How fast were you going, and how long and steep was the hill?

At 60-75 temps were around 425-435 - hard remember exactly as I was trying
to keep an eye on the road as well.  High temps occurred going up long
and/or steep hills.

&gt;&gt; Cooling tin etc.

It is all in place - as far as I can tell and know.  Only issue is around
old A/C compressor.  The foam gasket around the tin is almost complete.
There is a 2 inch gap at the top towards the front of the bus.  There are
also some small gaps around the aforementioned compressor.  Other small gaps
around spark plugs and the alternator.

&gt;&gt; Timing

I believe the timing to be correct.  Problem is with the plastic timing
&quot;ring / thingy&quot; I'm not totally sure if it is correct position - it moves a
bit.  If one wants to err on the safe side with timing to keep cool...
should I advance or retard the timing?  How much?  Right now the bus starts
up perfectly and has good power - except of course on very steep hills at
low speeds.

&gt;&gt; CHT gauge

Dakota digital - old style rectangular gauge - HLY-1111 - with sender under
#3 spark plug - the rest of the unit it on and under the dash
http://dakotadigital_dot_com/index.cfm/page/ptype=product/product_id=495/categor
y_id=-1/home_id=-1/mode=prod/prd495.htm

Don't have sender under 1, 2 or 4.

&gt;&gt; Factory heater blower

As far as I can tell, I have original factory heat parts and as stated
earlier, I believe all the tin is in place.  One reason I believe all the
heater parts are in place is that when I turn on the heat - I get heat in
the cabin - it smells horrible, but it is hot.

&gt;&gt; Even if the heater boxes ... that direct it back via the two
extra little pipes that look like louvered exhaust pipes...

Now here is an issue.  When I was running hot yesterday I remembered that
last year I had noticed that the connecting flexible hose from the heater
boxes to the pipes that look like louvered exhaust pipes were shot and was
going to replace them.  Ooops... didn't do that.  I cobbled together some
this morning for a temporary fix but need new ones.  Do you folks think that
this may have been a major cause for high head temps?  Where is a good
source for this flexible tubing?

You folks are terrific!  Thanks again for your replies and in advance for
any updates.

Regards,

Wayne
