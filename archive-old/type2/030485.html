Subject: found 80 vanagon westy
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9907091201210.15382-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hello,

i have found an 80 vanagon westy, no rust, good tranny and interior needs
minor headwork, includes spare engine.  I dont really want a vanagon but
this guy is wanting to trade it for a motorcycle i'm having a hard time
selling...

if i fixed it and got it running, about how much is this thing worth?
how much would it be worth as is...  If someone was interested i could
throw in an 80 parts vanagon for a little extra $ too (bad autotranny, but
only 89k miles though, brand new heaterboxes, spare AT, good engine but
one valve is tight)

im not looking to get rich, just looking to cover my investment in the
cycle... And unload my current 80 for a fair price.

thanks,

Steve
