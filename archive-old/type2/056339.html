Marty,

I just came back from a trip to the Denver area and I think the interstates
have become slightly mad. I drove out there from Seattle in my 72 loaf and
I found the truckers to be more agressive than I had expected. I do like to
watch the oil temp and keep it under 225 so I travel more slowly than the
general flow of trafic. That wasn't usually a problem except where road
construction narrowed the traffic down to two lanes. That was treacherous.

Two things I would really advise on a long trip like that: have some kind
of temperature gage and take a little CB radio so that you can hear what
the truckers have to say. They can be very helpful. They also seem to be a
bit more tolerant of us odd drivers if they know we are listening to them
on channel 19.

I took enough tools to do major work but I didn't need any of them. The van
performed wonderfully. Got tossed around a bit by the wind up in Wyoming. I
traveled a lot at night to keep the engine more comfortable.

Good luck and don't set a real tight schedule on the trip.

John
