Hi.

Sean Bartnik mentioned a '70 camper in the Sunday Washington Post paper, at 
301 898 5601.  It is really a '72 camper.

The story:  sitting outside 7 years, pretty solid with moderate surface 
rust, and no noticeable rust through the body.  In my opinion, a really 
solid body that could use some basis surface grinding, and some POR 15, and 
a cheap-o MAACO paint job to look decent and resellable.

Has keys, and possibly a title.

Engine looks clean and dry and is said to have been rebuilt before being put 
out to pasture. The battery tray looked solid, a good indication for the 
rest of the body.

All four tire seem to have solid air pressure (after 7 years), and it looks 
like it could be towed.

Lots of junk inside, including the rear bumper.  Has a child cot.  Does NOT 
have a drive away tent.  Don't know the condition of the pop top canvas.

Worth the $300, but I would offer $200 if title was available.

A real VW shade tree mechanic might be able to get it on the road from where 
it stands, just off route 15 at 10798 Utica Mills Circle, Thurmont MD.

Check MAPQUEST for the location.  Just 65 miles from Springfield VA, and 33 
miles from Leesburg VA (!)

LOTS OF LUCK,  and let me know if you pick it up..
