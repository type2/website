Perhaps I should have pointed out that this was a '78 Westy I was
working on. The book states (Haynes manual) to put the engine in without
the gearbox being unsecured from the chasis. Tell you what, try and
install your engine with the gearbox still attached to the chassis, then
come back and tell me you had a great time!

Following your example is basically what I did. However perhaps the '78
differs as I now have to refit the rear tin plate somehow. If I had left
this attached I would not have been able to tighten up the two gearbox
bolts. I guess the '81 design makes that a bit easier.

By the way the fuel tank was very easy so I don't know why you say its
the easier of the two. I'm still sticking to my words, if you follow the
book... its a bitch!

How do you tighten up the gearbox bolts, is the design different in that
there is no tinware in the way?
