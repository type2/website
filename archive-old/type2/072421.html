I spaced the barrels out in order to make the compression  7.5 to 1 for unleaded gas.  Now my valve adjusters are about 1 thread short of reaching all the way through the lock nut.  This is on a 72 type 2 with the type 4 (pancake) engine.  My question is- would swivel adjusters, with their longer shank, be a good solution?  I've heard that swivel adjusters need to hit the valve dead center.  If so, do they make shims and spacers that will fit my rocker arms so I can set the geometry right?  Will the swivel adjusters clear my valve covers?  Do they make larger valve covers for this engine?  Thanks for any help or info.
