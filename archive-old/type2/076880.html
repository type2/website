Subject: Retractable Seat Belts

Hey Folks, I'm a bit late on this thread.   I'd like to get new, comfortable 
and effective seatbelts for Buster, my bus.   He's a 1973 VW Camper Bus.  I'm 
first looking for seatbelts for the front.  Next, I'd like to get seat belts 
for the rear seats.   Does anyone know where I can get these?  New would be 
preferred.

I realize this discussion may have already taken place in the news group, so 
if anyone could email me directly about where I could get these, rather than 
having to reinform the entire list (unless it would be helpful to others) I'd 
much appreciate it.  Thanks!
