Subject: Passenger Seat Back Panel

Greetings,
Can't remember if &quot;wanted&quot; posts are acceptable on the list, but then,
it's Friday.
I am looking for a Right Seat Back Panel for the my 72 bus that fits
behind the passenger seatframe (you see it when entering thru the
sliding door). It's depicted as item C on p. 136 of WCM's catalogue.
Unfortunately, they only sell that panel as part of a whole kit at a
modest $568, so I'll pass on their offer. Contact me directly via e-mail
if you have one or know where to get one, preferably off-white or tan.
