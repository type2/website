Subject: Re: Say what?

&gt;We were parked in my '67 camper outside a business beside the highway one
&gt;morning after sleeping there the night before. The bus was having trouble
&gt;starting, and I was back at the engine checking wiring connections. The
&gt;proprietor of the business, apparently concerned about our bus detracting from
&gt;his business offered us the advice from his VW wisdom that perhaps we were
&gt;having problems with the water pump. I thanked him, and eventually we got back
&gt;on the road...

        NO, NO, NO!!!  It's the dammed ABS system, *that's* why it wont
start! ;-)

Peace,
