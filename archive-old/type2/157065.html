&gt; Hey gang,
&gt; OK, I'm at my wit's end with this idle problem on my
&gt; 71 camper.&lt;&lt;

I had the exact same symptons on my 71 Westy and did
all of the things you described, even bought and
installed a brand new carb, to no avail.  It turned
out that one of the hoses venting the fuel tank had
gotten crimped and the tank was not venting. Replaced
that vent line and it was all smooth sailing!!  After
running it for a while, take the gas cap off and see
if there is any kind of a &quot;hiss&quot; or escape of air when
you open the cap. If so, thats your problem.

Peace, John Baker
