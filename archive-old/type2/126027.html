Subject: water tank wiring

I am installing a mid 80s interior in our 72. I am ready to setup the water 
tank. The guy I bought it from had everything apart so I need some help. The 
wire harness has a green wire with a female terminal with male connector on it 
so that another wire can piggyback, then with that wire is a black wire female 
end. In the cabinet next to where the tank sits are three loose wires, 1 
yellow, 1 green and 1 white which attach to a small black box. What is the box for 
and on the water tank there are 4 ends for wires which color goes where. 
Thanks I can send pictures but if someone could just look in there cabinet at the 
tank and let me know this would be great. 
PS, I am not using the original water tank I have installed one under the 
belly of the bus and will be wiring up to that but still need to know what wire 
does what. I know this must be for the level of water. Does anyone want this 
tank. Can ship.
