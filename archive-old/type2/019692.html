Subject: FI stuff: Injector Testing &amp; Fuel Pressure Regulator Questions

Volks:

Forgive me if this info is in the archives; I am being denied access
this evening, and am too frustrated to wait.

Readers of recent  posts by yours truly may recall that I just failed
Atlanta emissions because my CO was too high -- like 7% too high (10.5
instead of 3.5) -- at 25 mph.  but none of the injectors are leaking, so
I'm wondering if it could be a spray pattern problem.

Two questions:

(1) Anyway, I want to know if anyone has injector testing options that
differ from what the Bentley offers.  I've been testing the injectors
for leakage and the fuel pressure without firing the injectors by
manually operating the air flap in the AFM (with the ign. key turned to
the ON position), and not by turning the engine over.  I'd like to test
the injectors similarly, without having a helper turn the engine over,
and ideally, one at a time, to limit the amount of atomized gasoline
spraying around the engine compartment.

(2) My pressure regulator was reading high (40 psi) with my new Actron
branded pressure gauge, so I swapped in another, and it was the same,
and then another, and it was the same again.  So I'm thinking that
Actron is not big on accuracy, and am not currently thinking it is a
high pressure problem (though I could be convinced otherwise).  However,
and here's the issue, with the two replacement pressure regulators, the
fuel ring was not holding pressure for more than a couple of seconds
after I stopped operating the fuel pump, and after having reinstalled
the original pressure regulator, the fuel ring once again holds
pressure, and quite well.  What's the deal?  Presumably these things are
not supposed to pass fuel after the pump has stopped operation, right?
And I can and should just toss regulators numbers 2 and 3 in the trash,
yes?  I do still have an as yet untested regulator #4, FWIW.

(3) Could a poorly adjusted AFM mixture (i.e. misadjusted with the
idle/CO mixture screw) produce such high CO levels under load?  I want
to eliminate the other options before I mess with the AFM, but I'm
beginning to thing that it is an AFM issue -- it might be worth noting
at this point that the black plastic cover on the AFM was loose, and has
apparently been removed in the past.  I do have a couple of spare AFMs,
so I can swap in another for the retest -- but I figure I may as well
test the injector spray pattern as long as I have the ring laying on top
of the engine ready to make gas mist everywhere.
