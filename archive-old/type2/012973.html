&quot;Paul Morgavo&quot; &lt;morgavo_at_home_dot_com&gt; asked:

&gt;&gt; Are all 68-79 Cargo door inside handles the same (interchangeable)?

Snoopy said:

&gt;No, they are all not interchangeable.....  68-73 should be the same.  70
&gt;will definitely fit.  74- the key cylinder was located under the handle and
&gt;not in it.

And I would add that they're not all the same even within the same model year: at some point in there a different inside handle for the Westies was available.  My 71 has 
it but my old 68 didn't.  It has an extended upper portion above the screw, I suppose to make it easier to operate with the sink cabinet in the way.  The westy and non-
westy style would be interchangeable, of course.

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong....  &lt;--- unnecessary request :)
