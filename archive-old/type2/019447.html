I have a 74 Westy.  I have used a 79 2.0 liter (Hydraulic lifters) with the
1800's carbs.  Due to the increasesd air flow, it ran richer, thus, cooler and
more power.  I currently have a 1976 2.0 liter with fuel injection.  It was not
a difficult conversion.  All the FI parts were with the engine, and darn, I
went and welded up the EGR holes in the air distribution box, adjusted the
mixture to 2.5% CO at 2500 RPM, Frankly, I am very pleased with the running.  A
1776 implies a build up of a Type 1 engine.  The type 4 engine is a new design
for heavier vehicles than a bug.  Type 1s are based on a 1930s design which
began life as a 25 HP, 1100 cc.  There is always less stress on a type 4 than a
built up type 1.  The tinwork will not match up for cooling in the 73.  You
will have to find a way to return your compression to a useful level, no more
than 7 to 1.  If you increase the stroke, you will also increase the piston
speed.  High compression and high piston speeds cause high heat, the bane of
any aircooled engine.

Keep smiling,

Mike
