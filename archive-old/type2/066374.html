Subject: Pertronix in a standard disributor

Before changing to a 009 distributor I used to use my PERTRONIX in a standard
distributor....

If my memory is correct after removing the points from the standard distributor 
I had to remove a further &quot;bananna&quot; shaped plate held in by the position 
adjustment screw. Any way the &quot;bananna&quot; shaped plate to which the PERTRONIX
is bolted went in dead easy replacing this lower plate. (Keep all the bits in a
bag tucked in your tool box just in case....).

It may well be a good idea to hold off fitting it any way to ensure you don't 
invalidate any warranties.......
