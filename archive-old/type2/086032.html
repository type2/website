Subject: Parts interchange-ability?

OK Volks, I need a quick answer?  I'm needing a steering knuckle and tie rod 
as well as a rotor.  A fellow list member says &quot; I have a couple of axles 
off a 78 Which I think are the same&quot;

Would anybody know if these parts are workable for a '71?  Knowing this will 
be needed in order to determin if Me and my lady will be tenting it at 
Patty's Wagens to pick up these parts or hanging out at a local bone yard 
trying to extract these parts off some poor old sole of a Bus...
