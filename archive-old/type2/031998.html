&gt; Along the way, I discovered that the engine is actually a GE ('79) case,
&gt; complete with the Hall sensor at the flywheel and that the EGR tube to
&gt; the nonexistent catalytic converter (or whatever had been down there)
&gt; had been cut just below the tin. This was probably due to the
&gt; installation of the aftermarket exhaust system, which I remember as
&gt; being pretty quiet.
&gt; 
&gt; Questions I have:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Will the engine or FI suffer because of the removal/alteration of the
&gt; catalytic converter or is this the equivalent of a heat riser ?
&gt; (assuming that the van had a catalytic converter). Can I simply
&gt; fabricate a plug(s) and leave this tube off ?

The tube that was cut off ran to an EGR filter which, in turn, connected 
to the exhaust system.  The EGR setup is a pollution control item and its 
absence should not affect the FI.  If you don't have pollution monitoring 
in your neck of the woods you can just remove the EGR valve all together, 
plugging up holes, of course.  If you do have inspections and need the 
EGR valve to be in working condition, you'll have to scramble a bit since 
these things can be hard to find.

&gt; 2. Are there any advantages to trying to find the proper coil and
&gt; distributor to utilize the Hall sensor and thus the breakerless ignition
&gt; system ? Or are other parts of the FI system unique to this system ?

The Hall effect distributor doesn't use a sensor in the flywheel.  I 
wonder if that isn't the (rarely seen) TDC sensor that VW mechanics were 
supposed to use in diagnostics?
 
&gt; 4. Am I wrong, or does the thermostat work opposite of the 1600 and
&gt; older engines ? It appears from the instructions in the Bentley that the
&gt; proper adjustment is to close the flaps, pull the actuating wire tight
&gt; and clamp down the nut. This would mean that we are relying on the
&gt; thermo to expand and open the flaps and if for some reason it did not,
&gt; the flaps would remain closed and thus possibly overheat the engine...am
&gt; I nuts here ?

Don't know about older engines, but you've described the procedure 
correctly for the Type IV engine.  Since thermostats fail in the expanded 
position, the flaps would fail in the open or cooling position, assuming 
your spring is in place.
