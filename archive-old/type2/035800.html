Subject: Re: Deal on Boge shocks!

&gt;
&gt; So...in driving a 30+year-old vehicle, do you want to
&gt; drive it &quot;as-it-was&quot; 30+years ago? If so, do you drive
&gt; on non-radial tires (I.E., do you actually have tubes
&gt; in your tires....like they *came* from the factory)?
&gt;
&gt; C'mon...
&gt;
&gt; Gas-shocks are a *serious* improvement in *HANDLING*
&gt; technology, IMHO.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Either way I'll be interested to hear if anyone has
&gt; &gt; anything to say about
&gt; &gt; these Boge shocks after installing them.
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, me too! Especially if they've driven/own/owned
&gt; busses equipped with gas-shocks.
&gt;
&gt; Like I said...sorry!

This arguement (about when the need for improvement outweighs the vintage
preservation) applies to everything you do maintaining your bus.

What about the basic issue of whether the vw itself is a viable platform for
reasonable performance and safety after 30 years?

Credentials: past vehicles 55 barndoor, 56 Panel, 58 porsche 356 coupe, 61
deluxe 23 window with sunroof, 66 kombi, 67 crew cab, 68 westy, currently two
71's, a sunroof deluxe and a westy. (And lots and lots of bugs never newer
than 67, currently a 65 bug).

Disclaimer: My ability to assess the post 71-models comes from the
heartbreaks of my friends and family who, before I could stop them,
mistakenly purchased later models thinking that they could count on the
implied relation to the earlier models.

How many of you folks have rolled a vw or owned a rolled vw and are still
driving one?  I have had the experience of buying a previously rolled bus and
enjoying it for many years with the swing axles modified for safety by simple
bolt-on adapters and chevy rims with enough offset to give the correct
neutral camber.

I have also rolled in a vw bug doing an autocross race.   But my swing-axle
65 bug now still has oil shocks and no rear camber compensator.  Stupid?
Yes.  Stubborn?  Yes.  There are lots of practical advantages outweighing the
safety limitations that makes me prefer driving these old cars compared to
new ones.

I could never go back to any of the following (in a type II): original intake
or exhaust systems, non-counterweighted crank, only 65 hp, only 68 mph top
speed, only 20.6 mpg.

With the available off-the-shelf stuff, I get 75 mph and 23 mpg at 60 mph,
and 150,000 miles on a bottom end.  Still have to change heads every 50 K
miles, though.  It's a stock 1600 type I longblock except for the crank.

But hey, I could happily use tube-type bias ply continental original tires,
though, and yes, even non-gas shocks!

I say that your ultimate dilemma is whether or not you even justify owning a
vw bus at all, underpowered, maybe unrealiable, and certainly unstable in
high-speed driving in its stock form.  You are way behind the need to keep up
with 120 mph-rated tires and suspensions!

Anything newer is not necessarily better, as anybody with experience of
pre-71 vs. 72 later buses as a mechanic and long-term owner.  You may have
noticed the discussion about the advantages of converting out-of-smog type
4's back to the type 1 1600 motors, which by the way can go up to 2.1 liters
(stroked to 78 and using only 90.5 barrels) if you want to get the power back
and still save money and increase reliability.

When VW wanted to make more money, they continued to allow the built-in
engine failures, to bring their customers back to the service department or
to get a newer car.

But they failed to factor in the american do-it-yourself and re-design
penchant.

What makes me stay with my 71's are their ability to be adapted to
improvements for better-than-original economy, long-life and durablility, ie
counterweighted crank, 2-brl progressive carb, lower backpressure header
system, improved cooling, none of which interferes with the impression of it
being a stock vintage car to most observers, except that it goes much faster
and much more reliably.  Anybody who drives buses exclusively for 30 years
like me will figure this out eventually.

And find another drivetrain like the bus, one ton capacity, 300K miles before
transmission maintenance of any kind on the 68-71 models, and the original
brakes on the front of my 66 kombi going 140 K miles....

Try driving anything else, crawling for two days and 200 miles over jeep
trails down the uninhabited gulf coast of baja on one tank of gas , coming to
a closed gas station and going another 50 miles to the next one without any
problem.

These cars are the greatest because nothing else can do what they do, let
alone at the lowest cost of zero depreciation with nearly unlimited life.  I
fully expect my current cars to last another 30 years and be even more
reliable than they are now (if I could just get one of those MR FUSSION
propulsion devices by then).
