Subject: Away from home w/o a manual

Hi, I've been overseas and unsubscribed for awhile. I return soon and plan 
to give my trusty 71 Kombi a full mechanical rebuild. It came w a 009 and 
Holley 'bug spray' carb when I got it 20 years ago. I plan to restore to 
stock. I've just come across the twin to my van, rotting away in the 
tropical environment of Saipan. I've been given the OK to take whatever I 
want. The parts I need to 'restock' seem to be in OK shape. I took some off 
today. I don't have a manual w me, could use some help. I'm not getting a 
real good look at things due to the bush, rot, and general funkyness.
To get the carb/'intake manifold' off(the part that's attached to the carb, 
on the carb side of the rubber boots that connect it to more 'intake 
manifold', which I don't need) :
   -looks like the generator needs to come off, I removed the strap that 
goes around it, but it's not moving much. Something else to unfasten?
   -heat riser tubes: I've removed the small pieces of tin(one each side), 
how do I access the fasteners holding the heat riser tubes to whatever?
I hope to get back on this in about 11 hours. Any help greatly appreciated. 
As I said, I'm not getting a real good look at things due to the bush, rot, 
and general funkyness.

Thanks
Best wishes
Denny Johnson
71 kombi
