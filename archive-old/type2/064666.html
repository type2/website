Hi to all...Split Screen Van Club (UK) and Dave the magazine editor here. Back
again after about 6 months away (from the list that is).
Since then we all spent a month in NM, AZ and well the four corners bit....
OK some VW content....got met at airport by a '52 Deluxe (owned by Tom B or
Micheal Steinke depending on ?) driven round ABQ and R66 in it (a blast); found
an amazing backyard full of Veedubs (including Splits, Bays, Ovals, andT3's)
near Mancos Colorado, was treated to R66 Splits hospitality with a gathering of
buses and bus freax and good times....saw the Sherriff's VW Bay near the
Painted Desert...oh yeah and saw some stunning scenery as well!
(But we toured in a 30 ft rig and were greatful for air conditioning, a
freezer/fridge 9for the beer) and cruise control (the roads and horizons just
go into infinity..)
So.....now to get back into downloaded daily and seeing what the Veedub Nation
is up to out there......
