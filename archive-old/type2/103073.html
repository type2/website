Subject: Re: [T2] Re:coilover shocks-were they ever VW option?

I'm at the point of buying some used coils that clamp on to my stock shocks
with brackets and u-bolts to produce a frankenstein coil-over of sorts.
I've seen this setup work on a mega-overloaded housebus, with no apparent
ill effects.  Any thoughts on this idea?  It would seem to retain stock
shock travel, just adding some stiffness.  My idea was to jack the bus up a
couple of inches, measure shock expansion, remove, add coils at that
expansion (current ride height +3in) and reinstall.  The shocks would then
be slightly tensioned at all times, raising the rear perhaps an inch or so
and adding some stiffness.  Advice/comments?  Also, what do folks think
about substituting the Astro Van coilovers?  Ala Jamie's suggestion:

If driven on the street?  Off-road?
Sorry to belabor this FART, but I am still getting conflicting advice and
opinions, and trying to make it up in volume, I guess...  TIA!

&gt;  Highly recommended, if you can get the right shocks.
&gt;
&gt; this is a FART &lt;LOL&gt; that has been surveyed a number of times,,, we could
&gt; ask
&gt; the question again to see if the results differ, but iirc the conclusion
has
&gt; always been that coil over shocks that FIT correctly will not break off
the
&gt; mount. or can I say, have never broken off a mount.
&gt;
&gt; Do you have experience with a broken mount you can share?
&gt;
&gt;  My Westy has about 200,000 miles on the mounts with coil over shocks,
still
&gt; going strong.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone say they have experienced a shock mount failure with a properly
&gt; fitted coil over shock installed??
&gt;
&gt; Please don't reply if you had a dune buggy with way toooo big coil overs,
or
&gt; ill
&gt; fitted air shocks that bottomed out before the suspension compressed
&gt; adequately.....
&gt;
&gt; just tell us about experience with stock coil overs on a stock bus used in
&gt; general driving circumstances.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
