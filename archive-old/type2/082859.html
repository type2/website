Subject: Re: [T2] Will Plywood Sheets Fit in a Bus

With the spare tire out, they will just barely fit through the rear hatch.
However, it is a very tight fit on mine and tolerances might make a
difference.  Measure twice, cut once!

I prefer to put plywood on the roof rack.

&gt; Before I drive over to Home Debit, does anyone know whether full size 4x8 sheets of plywood fit inside a completely empty (no seats at all) bay window bus?
