Phil,
White knuckled is an understatement.  My arms are still sore from 
yesterday's trip!  I had to go up to Green Bay (about 40-50 miles each 
way) for work yesterday.  I managed to get in a pack of semis for a 
little bit, and that was nice.  I was able to keep up speed and not get 
blown around.  When the wind was behind me, I'm sure I could have done 
90mph if I wanted to, but when it was a headwind, I was down to 45 at 
times.  This was all in a 71 bus (Stella).  My 62 seems to handle the 
wind much better for some reason.  Headwinds still suck, although not as 
bad, but it is much better in crosswinds.

On a side note...
I work for Penske Auto, and every once in a while a customer will need a 
ride to work or home because of their car being fixed.  I gave this lady 
(maybe 20-25yrs old) a ride to work today because I had to put a new 
water pump in her car and I wasn't able to get to it just then.  You 
should have seen the look on her face when I came around to pick her 
up.  It was priceless.  She didn't say too much during the drive, she 
was too busy being scared I think.  Sitting that close to the front 
makes some people worry.  But, she did comment on the bed in back 8-)

&gt;  Anyone else have &quot;fun&quot; driving their bus yesterday in the wind?
