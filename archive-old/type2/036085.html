Subject: RE:Brake drum saga

Jen,

As you know I live on Long Island and probably travel past where you live 
each day.  I have a pneumatic hammer that runs off an air compressor that 
you can borrow.  I think if you put the puller on and use the air hammer, 
it will most likely vibrate the drum off.  It would certainly be more 
effective than hitting it with a regular hammer as it gives a constant 
hammering.  You could even borrow my compressor if you do not have one. 
 Just let me know.

We were going to start cutting tomorrow but after reading the advice I
received, we're going to keep trying. Will most likely need a new brake 
drum
anyway, but cutting sounds like a b***h of a job. I should mention that the
axle nut was easily removed... just a little more than hand tightened so 
the
advice I received to drive around with it a few threads loose, well, it has
pretty much already been done when the PO drove it up onto the trailer and
the during the test drive prior to purchase. We're also concerned about the
bearings so not sure we'll try that method or not. We'll also be utilizing
the other advice we received and tomorrow we will be putting a blow torch 
to
it most likely.
