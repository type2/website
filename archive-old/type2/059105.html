George, 

I could not believe this was possible , it sounded &quot;too good to be true&quot;,
but I do know (John Anderson and I did some work on one of his) that the
case is very T1 looking and, yes, it is aluminum!  So I threw it out there
for discussion.  One thing I *do* know is that just cutting the water
jacket off a wasserboxer cylinder set is gonna get you a *very*
short-lived engine :-)

What I don't know is:

what the diameter of the spigot holes is in the wasserboxer case;

whether a set of aircooled P&amp;C's is made in that diameter;

whether you could get tin onto the resultant engine;
   (wasserboxers don't need or have tin beyond dust shielding)

How you would cool it.  
   (as you say, T1 cooling is close to its max at 1600cc's, tho racers 
    *do* bore to 2L!)

This may turn out to be a case of $peed co$t$.  Do-able but not practical.
