     Hi Folks,
     
     I will be in England from the 19th to the 26th/27th of July coming 
     from France. I need the following stuff done to my van :
     
     1.Welding - cabin floor+steps needs replacing and because of a lot of 
     leaking around the windscreen, the dashboard is coming away from the 
     metal under the windscreen. Not sure if it needs replacing or welding.
     2.Rubber - Rubber around some of the windows needs replacing
     3.Bodywork - one of the panels in the rear needs replacing and there 
     is quite a bit of blistering around most of the van that needs taking 
     care of.
     4.MOT required.
     
     Question is : Does anybody know any garages on the south coast, that 
     could do all this stuff in a week, preferably near one of the ferry 
     ports coming from France !?
     
     Thanks for any help provided.
