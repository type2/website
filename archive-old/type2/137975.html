Subject: RE: [T2] Can't get engine out

This may be so.  However, the requester stated that he was having problems
removing his engine and needed some tips.  I did not state that he 'had' to
remove the tin and oil filler, just that this would make it much easier.
Removing these items takes only a few minutes but can make the process much
easier.

Troy, you don't have to remove anything from the engine (well.. maybe 
the FI stuff).  all you do is remove the tranny carrier bolts and let 
the whole assembly come down.  Then pull the engine off the tranny and 
voila.
