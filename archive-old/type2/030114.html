&gt; Not sure if oil can reach the valve guides to prevent galvanic reactions

&gt; filling with oil is to also remove any possible moisture condensate

Galvanic reaction requires an electrolyte which oil isn't.

If you're going to go this route, I suggest loosening the rockers to
relieve the valve springs, fill the crankcase with oil to the top, remove
spark plugs, fill cylinders, and put the whole works on a shallow pan
because it's going to leak somewhere.  Use only new oil, as old oil will
have acids that are bad for the engine.
