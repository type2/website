Subject: Distributor springs

Somebody was asking for one of these recently. I found two over the
weekend -- people pull the dizzies at the yards and leave the springs
behind. I fish 'em out with my fingernail. And I'm always looking for
more. 

So if anyone needs one of these, I've got two spares. Drop me a line and
mail one off to you.

Nikki
