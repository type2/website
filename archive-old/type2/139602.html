Subject: Re: [T2] Aurora Super Mag Plus wires

Jason,

for me, Hi performance means anything with &quot;real&quot; copper wire...I hate 
resistance wiring....it seems to go flakey at any time and it is hard to 
decide when.

I have bought &quot;accell&quot; brand wires at the flaps and modified them the same 
way that you did....they last forever  **and** have *real* copper wire in 
them...and, you get 8 wires instead of just 4.

So the next question is this...anyone ever use the non resistance wires 
and have trouble with their radio...or any other interference?

Maybe someone can explain another reason why we are all supposed to be 
using these?  

If you need to have a non-resistance rotor for CDI, then whay would you 
use wires that are also full of resistance???

Puzzled, dave

&gt; Hi folks...
&gt; 
&gt; I installed some of the Super Mag Plus wires that aircooled_dot_net sells 
&gt; today.  They seem like very nice wires, except for one very annoying 
&gt; problem: they come with the wrong plug ends for a Type 4 engine.

snipped for brevity...
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone with high-performance wires on their engine have resistance 
&gt; specs they can share?
