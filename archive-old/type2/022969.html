An update.  I stopped by Costco today to look at the Kirkland LT195/7514 
tires.  They looked sort of small and were $61 each, not $48 as others had 
reported in the archives.  The guy told me that the $48 tires were the 
passenger car tires, i.e. P195/75/14.  The guy also told me that he had 
seen cracks like these before, and that they were nothing to worry 
about.  Just stress relief cracks.  Sounds like what MSHP used to say about 
their heads.  :)

Next stop was Discount Tire.  The guy there checked the depth of the cracks 
and said that they were fairly deep.  Combined with the fact that they 
extended into the sidewalls he recommended I get new tires.  Despite his 
obvious motivation I think he was being sincere.  They had a stack of 
Yokohama 185R14D tires with a heavy layer of dust on them.  $78 each and 
they were willing to credit me about $120 for the three cracked BFGs - I 
guess they can send them back to BFG for credit.  With mounting, stems, 
tax, and road hazard warranty it would be $270 out the door.

BUT...

I don't like the looks of the Yokos.  They are generously rated at 
something like 1800lbs and are plenty tall, but they are so SKINNY!  Tread 
patch is maybe 5 inches wide vs. about 8&quot; with the 27x8.5x14 tires they 
would be replacing.  I have never run this narrow of a tire and I worry 
about things like stability and traction when compared to wider tires.  My 
bus is heavier than most, and with a full length permanent highroof needs 
even more resistance to crosswinds.  I also do the occasional offroad run 
and I'm afraid they would be terrible in the sand and dirt.

For about the same price I can get Discount's house brand (Trailhandler) 
27x8.5x14C tire.  This tire has exactly the same specs as the BFGs I'm 
replacing (with a less aggressive tread pattern), and since I've been happy 
with the performance of the BFGs, I think it would be less of a risk to get 
this tire.

What I'm looking for are recommendations based on actual experience with 
the Yokohama Y356 Load range D tire.  Things like, &quot;I run this tire on a 
highroof bus and live in Kansas where the winds are terrible&quot;, or &quot;I climb 
pike's peak with the yokes and I pass Jeeps on the way up&quot;.  I need 
reassurance here cause I'm leaning towards the Trailhandlers - they give me 
a warm fuzzy.

I need to make a decision in the next couple of hours so I can have them 
put on today and be ready to leave for Everybus on Wednesday.  I'm going to 
scour the archives now.

Thanks,

-David

&gt; &gt; I was just doing the pre-Everybus trip inspection, brake adjust, oil
&gt; &gt; change, etc. and noticed that three of my four tires have some nasty
&gt; &gt; looking cracks in them.  Pictures here:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I bought these tires at a swap meet a bit less than two years ago.  They
&gt; &gt; were brand new.  Since then I have put about 25,000 miles on them and they
&gt; &gt; have at least 50% tread depth remaining.  The specs are 27x8,50R14LT 91S
&gt; &gt; M+S Load Range C Max Load 1515 lbs at 50psi cold.
