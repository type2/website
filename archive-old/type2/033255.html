We have a winner! The great H. Steve has convinced me that Cathy Rigby
is my new (s)hero. Here's what he said: &quot;that piece is a structural item
(bracing the bus against twist) and is welded in.&quot; Aesthetically it
could be interesting to modify the partition behind the seats, but I
wouldn't go tearing weight-bearing walls outta my house on a whim,
either. 

Much like she who shall remain nameless, at her age my bus needs all the
support she can get, especially with the few extra pounds she so
gracefully carries. :-P
