&gt; I have a chance to buy a 78 westie. I currently have a 79 westfakia with a

&gt; are the tranys the same? The seller says that the engine is a 2000 and it is
&gt; fuel injected. Reading the Haynes and Bentley are really confusing with
&gt; respect to what year had what. If the VID helps it is 2382134207.

it should be a bolt in fit, about the only major difference in the engine
is the exhaust system, you might have some minor problems hooking up the
heat ducts

don't know much about the Westy's
