&gt; been a long time since I had my upright engines but I am pretty sure the
&gt; fan housing is different, it is flat on the top so the engine is a bit
&gt; shorter

Nope, they are all flat on top.
Teh only difference is the tapped bosses for the moustache bar on the rear
of the engine.  some bug engines had 'em, some didn't.
