This is not the same one you had, but you did describe it fairly closely.  It
has the bed and storage spaces as described as well as the tables.  A PO
carpeted the floor, bulkheads and ceiling but peeling it away it still has the
liners (white).  The bus was and is still white all around with black trim.  I
found a label at the bottom of the bench seat that reads:

WESTFALIA WERKE-K-G
WEIDENBRUCK/ WESTF, GERMANY

CAMPMOBILE 803.00081

I assume this means that the equipment (minus the carpet) is original and
installed.  Does this mean my bus qualifies as a &quot;Westy&quot;?  Any other info
about this style I would greatly appreciate.

&gt; These are not pseudo-campers. They were built by Westfalia. I've seen a
&gt;  couple down through the years. Ex-husband donated the one I'm describing
&gt;  here to a convent in Mexico around 10-15 years ago. In March 1973, we
bought
&gt;  this new 1972 camper from the VW dealer (Wester, I think) in Monterey
&gt;  California. It was solid Sierra Yellow (breast-fed baby poo yellow, don't
&gt;  ask me how I know). It did not have: a pop-top, sink/icebox, rear quarter
&gt;  closet, electrical outlets, seat behind driver. The bulkhead behind the
&gt;  front seats where the seat and the sink/icebox usually lives was paneled
&gt;  with the baltic birch. There was a bracket behind the driver's seat to
&gt;  attach the stool to. It did have: yellow/gold vinyl upholstery on the Zbed
&gt;  and stool, jalousie windows with screens/curtains, stool, kids cot up
front,
&gt;  full-width Z bed, full width storage cabinet with a door above the
&gt;  &quot;way-back&quot; area in the rear, storage under the back seat without an access
&gt;  door (with cutouts on either side to store the kids cot), the darker
formica
&gt;  paneling on the cabinetry in the back, the light gray vinyl flooring in the
&gt;  back, the table hinged under the jalousie window on the driver's side, the
&gt;  light fixture over the table, a dome light for the front. The front of the
&gt;  bus was standard, tan basket weave seats, etc. 
&gt;  
&gt;  It was a great bus and I wish the ex had given me a chance to buy it from
&gt;  him. Where are you? Perhaps it found its way back from Mexico to a loving
&gt;  home in the US. Wouldn't that be a hoot?
