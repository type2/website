Subject: Re: [T2] Pushrod tube removal

&gt;The tubes can stick when you try to pull them out, especially if somone
&gt;used some sort of sealer in a past install.  There is not much gripping
&gt;room, and resist the urge to use a plier if you want to reuse them.
&gt;Clean oily tubes real well (Gumout works well) in the center 3&quot;.  See if
&gt;you can turn any by hand, and if so, twist them out; you'll have more
&gt;room to grip adjacent sticky tubes. I've had good luck wrapping
&gt;reinforced strapping tape around the tube center and then yanking on the
&gt;tape to get it going.  I suppose one could try a small strap wrench also
&gt;and yank sideways on it.  If you can find a perfectly fitting &quot;core
&gt;tube&quot; that fits in the tube, push that in and then use a grip plier.
&gt;    You can use a puller that expands internally, much like the bicycle
&gt;handlebar stem that has a threaded wedge pulled up into the puller as
&gt;you tighten the long bolt at the end.  I envision using a piece of pipe
&gt;that just fits into the pushrod tube.  Cut on a steep diagonal to
&gt;produce a wedge end.  Use a piece of allthread or very long bolt to hold
&gt;the 2 pieces together.  Figure a way to prevent the nut at the wedge end
&gt;from spinning, like weld/epoxy it to the end.  Insert, and tighten the
&gt;exposed nut or hex head.

I use a pair of slip joint pliers - the long handled type - and I do it 
very carefully. If I squeeze too hard I can feel the tube flex and I back off.

The important part of the removal is to twist the tube back and forth alot 
at a medium pace (not jerking it back and forth and not treating it like it 
was made of crystal) while gently giving it some pressure to encourage it 
to drift towards the head.

What does the pliers do to the tube? Nothing. There are a couple scratches 
but no dents or gouges. It's easy to ruin a tube as I did for an 
'experiment' with a Type I tube once.

You have to be very, very gentle though. I have never had to replace a tube 
on a Type IV. Great design IMHO.

Now if it only had 6 cylinders. Oh - that's a Corvair engine. Different 
thread.... &lt;grin&gt;
