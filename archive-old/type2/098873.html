&gt; Hello All and George     The only thing I see that you missed talking about
&gt; was the spring inside the wheel cly. I have seen a bunch of the rear wheel

&gt; all had them. Later and have fun  Mark Dearing Salem Import Service Salem Va

Hmmm? Spring?  Dang, my ignorance grows every time I figure out something
new!  I assume that the purpose of the spring is to move the pistons apart
and I have no idea if the new cylinders (Brasilian Varga) came so
equipped.  Now I won't be able to get to sleep...  :)
