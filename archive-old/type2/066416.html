Subject: Heat for da bus

I've been leery of gas heaters ever since I passed one on to a friend a 
few years ago. This was a stock-option from an early model beetle, but 
hadn't been used in years. I'm not sure how most of these units work, 
but this one had a coil and spark plug for ignition. Is this standard?

Any way, Steve got it to work and installed it in his bus. Something in 
the exhaust went wrong, because it got so hot that it blistered the 
paint on the side of the van.

He went back to the stock heater, so I came up with this idea for his 63 
camper.

We took some heavy guage wire (coat hangers, as I recall) and tack 
welded a frame. On top it clipped into the opening for the fresh air 
intake. It made an upside down &quot;L&quot; shape, and 2 screws held the bottom 
of the &quot;cage&quot;. In the center, I screwed in a small ceramic heater (110 
v), that I picked up at a garage sale. We ran some heavy guage 
electrical cable through a grommet in the floor, and wired the heater to 
a plug behind the front of the bus.

At night, he'd plug in an extension cord, running to an outlet near the 
door going out to the garage. In the mornings, just before sitting down 
for breakfast, he'd plug it into the outlet. By the time he'd finished 
his second cup of coffee, the van's temp was raised about 40 
degrees.

Once the interior surfaces were warm, the van stayed comfortable for the 
20 mile journey into work, and &quot;iced&quot; windows were could be cleaned w/ a 
squeegy. As best as he could tell, it raised his electric bill about $5 
a month, after he installed an oil heater as well.

I know it was just wishful thinking on his part, but he said the van 
seemed to run better when it was prewarmed.
