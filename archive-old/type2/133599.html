&gt;most places are simply referring to them as non insulated open
&gt;barrel crimp connectors.

That would only describe the female spaded terminal found in the rest of
the electrical system not the FI connectors.

-----------------------------------------------

non insulated open barrel crimp connectors only refers to the fact that
the crimp side of the terminal (not the push on part) is barrel shaped
when crimped but its open when uncrimped.  as opposed to regular non
insulated terminals where the portion that you crimp with your tool is a
round closed barrel before you crimp it.  here are a couple of the
resources that i used to arrive at that in addition to hanging out at my
local old school electronics shop over the past several days.

i'm familiar with eagleday_dot_com and i will be buying some of my other stuff
from them but i want to buy the crimp terminals in bulk.  i used to have a
bunch of these and i only have a half dozen or so left.  so i want to
replenish my stock at wholesale prices.  the local dealer used to cut me a
pretty good deal but they say they don't know how to get the crimp
terminals any more.  by the way can any of the chemist types out there
tell me the chemical formula for brass?
