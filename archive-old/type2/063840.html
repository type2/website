Subject: '71 Brake Caliper overheating theories

&gt;Ron,
&gt;How long has it been since you've replaced the rubber brake hoses going to the
&gt;caliper? Old ones sometimes create the illusion of calipers not releasing. Darn
&gt;sight cheaper, too.

Bill,

I failed to mention that I replaced the hoses last summer when I did other
major brake work (master cylinder and power booster).  What puzzles me is
that the caliper appears to be functioning normally when I jack the bus up
and spin the rotor.  There is just a slight rubbing resistance, but nothing
seemingly abnormal or binding.  I wish I could see it fail.  Even when it
was burning hot and some pockets of smoke were whirling off the
caliper/pads, the rotor still turned freely!  

I've come up with all sorts of theories about this.  Let me bounce a couple
off you (OUCH!):  Is it possible that the smoking caliper is functioning
normally, but the other caliper is not, causing the working caliper to have
a larger work load and overheat?  Of course the other caliper seems to work
normally when I raise the wheel to check it, but I'm wondering maybe I can't
turn the rotor with my hand when the brakes are applied, but perhaps the
force/weight of the bus is enough to spin the rotor when the bad caliper is
allegedly braking.  

Here's another similar theory: Assume both front calipers are OK (since they
seem to be whenever they are checked).  What if the rear wheel cylinder on
the same side of the smoking caliper is non-functional?  Would this overwork
the caliper causing overheating on that side?  I should fess up and say my
braking isn't all that even (bus may pull to one side or the other when
braking, but not radically enough for me to get concerned over--uhhh, maybe
I should be concerned).  Anyhow, could a bad rear wheel cylinder (or maybe
even a blocked rear hose) cause a front caliper to overheat?  (I haven't
checked the rear cylinders yet--they are about 5 years/40,000 miles old I
guess).  New parts as of a year ago: master cylinder, power booster, rotors,
brake vacuum line, check valve, front pads, front brake hoses and metal
lines.  Rear brakes adjust fine and looks like enough meat is left on the
shoes.  I haven't recently pulled the rear drums to check the piston
movement of the rear wheel cylinders--could this be the source of my front
caliper overheating?
