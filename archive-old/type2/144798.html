Subject: It never rains in Southern Californa...

But it pours...

Well, it was raining this morning.  Nothing like the storms in the more
easterly parts of the US lately, but it was rain, something we haven't
seen for months.

Decided to take the bus on my 3/4 mile commute to work.  Get about halfway
there and hear an interesting noise that seems to coincide with the motion
of the wiper blades.  Quickly turn off the wipers just to discover that
the sound continues, coming from the car sitting next to me at the light.

Whew.

Turned on the windshield wipers again.  Nothing.  No motion on any
setting.  Cycle the switch a few times and still nothing.

Drive carefully to work, peering between the raindrops and trying not to
hit anything solid.

Once in the parking lot, I attempted the Universal VW Electrical Fix:
Wiggle the fuses.  Sure enough after all the fuses had had their massage
the windshield wipers started working again.

Now I have to figure out which fuse controls the wipers on the '71 and
then replace it and clean the contacts.

Either that, or just keep wiggling it now and then...  :)

George
