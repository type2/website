PMFJI, My '72 Westy has the galvanized U shaped poles.

&gt;VW/Wetfalia changed hammock styles around 1974 or so, you need the &quot;newer&quot; cot 
&gt;with the adjustable &quot;U&quot; channel poles (easily identifiable and the fact that 
&gt;they are finished in a glavanized finish) as opposed to the &quot;older&quot; black 
&gt;painted round tubed poles that you got. If it is any consolation it is a common

&gt;mistake.
