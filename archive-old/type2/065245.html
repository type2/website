Subject: Re: Exhaust valves at .008?

Michael,
  I concur with David, have been setting my exhaust valves at 0.008&quot; for
years. What's more, I have the original VW tuneup sticker on the engine
(engine code AW, 1800cc), and it says 0.006&quot; intake, 0.008&quot; exhaust. The
extra clearance is because they're sodium-filled for more efficient heat
transfer.
  Ciao,
            Gregor

&gt; &gt; &gt;here. Also, the manual says to adjust the intakes to
&gt; &gt; &gt;.006 and the exaust to .008. I had never heard this,
&gt; &gt; &gt;and would like some opinions on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's the right way to do it.  Gives the exhaust a larger
&gt; &gt; margin of safety since they run hotter.
&gt;
&gt;        Really? I'd never heard of this either. Although
&gt;        you were sure on the money with Vee Parts, drove
&gt;        there this morning -- WOW! A whole store with
&gt;        VW bits and pieces! Excellent!
