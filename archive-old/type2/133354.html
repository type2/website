&gt; &gt; i have a chance of getting goodyear tires for my bus at a good price.
&gt; What kind of goodyears should i get and at what rating is the best any
&gt; help would be grateful
&gt;
&gt; Does goodyear make a 185R14, load range C or D?  If not, consider whether
&gt; the cheap price makes it worth having the wrong tire on your bus.

you can also use (non stock) 195/75R14 or 205/70R14 tires without problems
but you still need the tire capacity ability.  gets a little more
complicated as the load ranges can be C and still not enough.

I have used 205/70R14 tires for many years but not goodyears (Michelins)
