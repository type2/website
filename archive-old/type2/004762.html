&gt;&gt; Does anyone have knowledge of putting a Toyota engine in a loaf?
&gt;
&gt;There's a fellow who has a web page illustrating his conversion. His bus
looks
&gt;like a big cow. He used the radiator from a Fiero mounted in a huge
fiberglass
&gt;wart on the top rear of the bus. If you did a search on the terms &quot;Fiero,&quot;
&gt;&quot;Toyota,&quot; &quot;Kennedy&quot; etc. you might snag it.
