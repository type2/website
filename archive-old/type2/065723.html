Subject: 73 bus owners manual.

Hey now, Everyone,
  I've been driving busses for over 10 years, but never seen any owners
manuals. Last time I went over to Germany I figured I'd get one there, but
came up empty.
  Most people there can't even remember what an aircooled
engine is. Very few busses around there, courtesy of the thing called TUV
(&quot;department of technical supervision&quot;). It's a german invention: They
designed an institution dedicated to the elimination of older cars. You have
to pass their technical checkup every 2 years or your car gets grounded.
  But I get distracted. The point is: Does anyone have an owners manual for
a 73 bus that they could xerox for me? In return, I'm willing to provide any
current VW pamphlets when I'm over there next X-mas.
  Any takers???
Ciao,
            Gregor
