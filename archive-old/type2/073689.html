Subject: What is it?

Found on a '72 camper, bolted to the overhead in the engine, no wires or 
hoses attached:

looks like a tiny electrical fuel pump, with inlet/outlet, adjusting screw, 
two pronged plug.

as big as a baby's fist.

Part number 113 906 283 (VW insignia)

Name on side is  A. Pierburg KG

Sorry, I do have a small picture, but I have no place to host the 28K image.
