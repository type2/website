Alas, my 68 camper seems ancient compared to yours with almost 14,000 made 
between ours.  Mine is 238-113969

I probably put too many questions in one of my notes a day or so back.  I'll 
remember to limit my paragraphs in the future.  The tube that appears to be 
the overflow or vent from my oil filler goes down through the rear tin and 
then just hangs out down there.  It looks like it might need a cap or filter 
or something.  There is a small hole in the side of the tube right before 
the end.
