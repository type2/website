Yeah, man, rub it in.

I have a Jacobs ignition bug pack that I just re-found.  8mm ignition wires. 
  Maybe I will try it out some day.

Jacobs says to open the plugs' gap by .005&quot; at a time, as long as you see a 
benefit, and when you have some loss if power, go back to the previous 
setting.  [ Or go from the .028&quot; to a jump of .045&quot; ] flat out.  No change 
of point gap or timing.

Now, that's tuning by the seat of the pants!!
