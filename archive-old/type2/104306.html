&gt; I have a '77 and I didn't order the extension (I assume you're talking about
&gt; the VDO sender).  All I had to do was use a Dremel tool grinder to slightly
&gt; enlarge the original hole in the engine tin and trim off a tiny bit of the
&gt; oil cooler tin (I did it this afternoon in fact).  Took about 20 minutes, so
&gt; I guess it all depends on what your time is worth.  The sender does seem to
&gt; make a snug fit for the dizzy, but I think I'll still have room to twist it
&gt; for timing.

Here's a good picture that Steve Dolan sent me:

Also, Scott Lyons &lt;slyons_at_netrover_dot_com&gt; points out this installation
problem...

The other issue with that sender is that the case thru bolt near the sender
(top rear one) must be facing the right way for the sender to fit. I found
this out the hard way. The bolt heads must be on the 3-4 side of the case.
If the bolts are installed pointing the other direction, the tip of the bolt
will want to interfere with the sender.
