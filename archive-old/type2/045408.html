Subject: [T2] Help...Gonna Get a Ticket for Too Loud

I was pulled over today by a state trooper who told me my '77 van was too
loud and I should get it fixed.  Now, it is loud compared to a &quot;modern&quot; car,
but it doesn't seem any louder to me than most other buses I've heard.
Maybe the police are now too young to remember what an air cooled engine
sounds like?

Anyway, there may be a crack in the pipe that runs through the heater boxes.
I don't use the van in cold weather.  The &quot;extractor&quot; type muffler is OK.
How can I repair that heater box pipe without buying new heater boxes...does
any one make a simple pipe that would replace the heater box pipe?  Lacking
that, has anyone had such a pipe fabricated?

Dan
