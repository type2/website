I can second that.  I spent nearly 2 days last weekend on my back taking my
heat exchangers off to cure a leak on #4 exhaust port.  As I took the HE off
that side, PLINK, out fell the gasket.  Not oval and flat, but all chewed up
and bent in two.  It must have got dislodged when I was fitting the HE in
the first place.  DOH!  So now the engine sounds *quiet* and *smooth*.  Wow!
Took the bus out on a 50 mile run yesterday, ran great.  Only problem, I
think the left hand head might still be blowing from between the barrel and
the head.  DOH again.  And while I was under the bus, I noticed one of the
CV boots was split.  DOH for the third time.  Oh well, at least I haven't
got that awful racket whenever I step on the pedal.

&gt; had no clear idea if I had it running well because I had nothing to
&gt; compare it to.  When I first joined this list, I was 
&gt; regularly astonished
&gt; --people would write in, reporting they'd fixed this or that 
&gt; condition,
&gt; and I would think to myself, whoa, you mean they're not supposed to do
&gt; that??
