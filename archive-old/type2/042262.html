Subject: RE:  Extremely HIGH oil pressure

&gt;I JUST started up the bus and the oil pressure SHOT up past 80psi (the 
&gt;highest it reads) and buried itself  as far as it could to the right. I 
&gt;checked my wiring and tried started the bus again. Again, my oil 
&gt;pressure SHOT up like a rocket. I turned the engine off and watched as 
&gt;the needle slowly moved back over to the left and stopped at zero. 

Is this a VDO gauge and sending unit (not that it matters, but that's the only 
brand I've ever worked with)?  Is the sending unit a dual sender (2 poles - one 
for the gauge and one for the light)?  I know for a fact that if the gauge wire 
shorts out it will peg the gauge to the high side.  I also know that if the 
sending unit is not grounded that it will not send proper readings (don't know 
if it goes high or low in that situation).

So, if it's a dual sender, make sure the gauge is hooked to the correct pole.  
Make sure the wire to the gauge isn't shorted anywhere along the way.  Make 
sure the sender itself is grounded good.  And make sure the wires on the back 
of the gauge are hooked up right (especially the ground wire).

With a fresh type IV 2.0 motor, running 20w50 oil with a stone-cold engine on a 
10 degree morning I only see about 70psi at 3000 RPM, rapidly dropping to 60.  
Then, after the pressure relief valve opens, I see about 40psi unless I get it 
really hot in which case I drop to about 9psi/1000 RPM.

Hope this helps.
