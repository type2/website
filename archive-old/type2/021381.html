Subject: Thank you list!


I posted a week or so ago re: a turn signal problem I was having.

I'd just like to quickly thank all list members for their help - the mere existence of the list gave
me the confidence to pull the instrument panel and poke around...Not only did I learn alot about my
bus, but I learned that it's OKAY to poke around!  I have hardly ever fixed anything of an
automotive, much less electrical nature, and lo!  after an hour's tinkering, my hazard lights work
and my turn signals actually cancel on their own!

King of the world, Ma!
