&gt; Yeah yeah.  :)  I would like to know about those Solex 40's also - I seem
&gt; to remember a listmember in Germany is running them - Marcus Schaper.
&gt; Marcus, are you still with us?

Still here. My carbs are not originally 40mm Solex. I believe they are (but my car is on the other side of the Atlantic in storage, so I cannot verify) 36-38 PDSIT, that were modified by Kummetat in Essen (pretty well known in Germany for air cooled tuning). If I remember correctly he widened them to 40mm (bored out I guess) and completely rebuild and rejetted them. Sorry, I don't have any info on the jest inside. They are mounted on shorter intakes that do not have any of the vacuum lines running between the two manifolds. They are sitting so low, that the stock air filter didn't it anymore, I had to switch to a dual carb Vanagon air cleaner.
My carbs and heads came off a '74 (I think) 411 1800 AT engine (dual carb, 75 hp).

My engine is 2L CJ case with stock crank, 296 cam, 914 P&amp;Cs, large valve heads, above mentioned carbs and solid lifters (hydraulic were not available in Germany). Estimated power output 100 - 110 hp at the flywheel. Needs 98 octane in summer.

74 Westy (in storage in Germany, waiting for 901 5-speed)
79 Westy (daily driver on this side of the pond)
