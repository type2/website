Subject: California Senate Bill SB 708

Please, no thank god I don't live there posts. This is a serious matter for
CA bus owners...

From the Porsche 911 Technical Forum on Pelican Parts Technical BBS:

California Senate Bill SB 708 (Florez) is set for hearing April 29.

In case you're missed the prior threads, this bill would eliminate the
current 30 year rolling smog exemption for cars registered in California.
Instead, all post-1974 cars would get a 45 year rolling exemption and all
pre-1974 cars would be exempt only if they were driven less than 12,000
miles/year .  Basically, this means you have to start rationing the miles on
your modified 1973 911 and the 1975 911 you've been planning to convert to
carbs needs to retain original smog gear until 2020.  Not to mention that,
once the legislative ball starts rolling, who's to say that legislators
don't make 12,000 miles into 6,000 miles or make 1974 into 1984 . . . ?

If you care, please contact your State Senator and state your views ASAP. Go
to http://www.sen_dot_ca_dot_gov to send email to your Senator, or better yet call
their office, or better yet write them a letter, or do all three!  Emphasize
that you are a car collector, collector cars are kept in top condition (not
smoky junkers), all the car clubs you belong to, all the people employed by
the car enthusiast and collector industry in California (do we need more
unemployment?), how miniscule is the contribution of collector cars to smog
in California, etc.  Search prior threads for a good sample letter by Wayne.

Remember, the hearing is April 29 .  Speak up now, or don't complain later.

P.S.  Also, please educate other car collectors about this bill.  It has
gotten little publicity and might just sneak through
