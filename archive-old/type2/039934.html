Subject: folding back seat for 73

Greetings,

I am looking for a back seat (one that will fold into a bed) for my
brother's '73 Bus. We live in Utah and would be willing to do a little
travel to pick one up. If anyone has an idea of where to buy one, please
e-mail us at buslover_at_vwbus_dot_org.

P.S. We would love any pics or bus stories to add to our Web site.
