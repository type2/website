Subject: [T2] %^$#%!!!!  cabinet removal!!!!

OK, I've found 2 bolts behind the drivers seat that boltup to the side of
the cabinet, and one in the cupboard closest to the back of the bus, on the
floor. That's it. Where are the others?? What am I missing? How is the water
pipe to the ouside vent removed? What about the floor drains?
Thanks,
Courtney
