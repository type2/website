Subject: Re: [T2] way too injected!

1. Back out (counter clock wise) the CO screw on the AFM. Mine takes an 
allen wrench. Remember the number of turns. If this is the problem (it gets 
you running)follow Bentley in adjusting the idle. Do not over do it and run 
too lean.


2 Measure the resistance of BOTH heat sensors through the ECU the connector. 
This way cables or connectors are included. Sensor 1: pin 6 to 27. Sensor 2 
pin 13 to ground. Both should be around 2500 to 3500 ohms cold and much less 
warm.  If you can, warm them (hair dryer?) up to see if the resistance goes 
down.

3 Measure the fuel pressure. If the regulator fails to work pressure can be 
excessive. There is a test port on the fuel manifold (drivers side).

If you don't have the tools to work on the FI system buy them.

A fuel pressure tester, CO tester, tach, and volt ohm meter can be had thu 
ebay or JCW for less than $350. The last time I bought a T4 engine long 
block it was over $2000.

Good luck.

&gt;Hello Friends,
&gt;I'm still trying get my &quot;78 Westy running well.
&gt;
&gt;The fuel injection STILL goes full rich (fuel dripping out of the 
&gt;manifolds!)and stalls or won't start in the first place.  The new AVP motor 
&gt;runs well when it runs.  I think I've checked everything as per the VW FI 
&gt;trouble shooting manual, but obviously I've missed something.
&gt;
&gt;I just checked the head temp. sender again---3.5K ohms at slightly colder 
&gt;than normal temperature.  I disconnected the cold start valve by running 
&gt;the fuel line around it (no fuel to cold start valve).  When cranking no 
&gt;fuel comes out the vacuum port on the fuel pressure regulator.  The flap on 
&gt;the air mass sensor seems free (I checked the resistance on the terminals 
&gt;of the air mass sensor previously--they seemed alright.  I tried a 
&gt;different FI computer (thanks again Karl). That didn't help.  What in god's 
&gt;name is pumping all that fuel through the injectors on and off??????
&gt;
&gt;The only thing which seems to help is disconnecting the computer and 
&gt;leaving it sit for a day or two.  Then it usually starts right up and runs 
&gt;fine for a while.  Lately it goes fine for 6-8 miles and goes full rich and 
&gt;dies.
&gt;
&gt;The not so local VW guy and the very not so local VW dealer have gotten it 
&gt;to run for periods but not consistantly.  What am I missing here?
&gt;
&gt;Any further help would be greatly appreciated as were the good leads I've 
&gt;already gotten from the list.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for any help in advance.
&gt;
&gt;Drew
