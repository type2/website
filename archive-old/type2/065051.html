&gt;Here's another idea...  Since when is a private publication 
&gt;responsible for publishing an unsolicited article and photo 
&gt;shoot?  We all may think we have beautiful vehicles that 
&gt;would be of interest to others and deserve to be seen, but 
&gt;do we have a biased opinion?
&gt;
&gt;I'm not trying to stick up for Hot VW's (in fact, I feel the 
&gt;publication has been slipping even further down to the knuckle 
&gt;dragger crowd in recent years, &amp; I find little to interest me).  
&gt;But the fact of the matter is, there are only so many pages 
&gt;they can publish in a year.  Do you realize how many submissions 
&gt;they receive &amp; the percentage that actually get published?

**********

Just for the record - I spoke with a junior editor at HOT VWs before I 
even wrote my query letter. Simurda's reply to my query letter was very 
positive and promising. SO - to say that my submission was unsolicited 
is sorta not true. I didn't just send the article without querrying.

Just wanted to make that clear.
