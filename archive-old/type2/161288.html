Subject: [WetWesties] My Van has been found!!!

Hello everyone
Firstly, I want to thank everyone on the list and other lists who  
have sent
me words of encouragement and support. This experience has only  
confirmed
what I suspected all along.  VW people are terrific, caring people.   
They
are the best!!!

My 78 Westy was found damaged in downtown Vancouver in a parking lot  
and it
was towed by a towing company for not having a ticket on the dash.  I
haven`t been able to get to Vancouver to see it, but my insurance  
company
has told me that my policy only allows me to have it towed to a  
company of
my choosing in the Vancouver area for repair work.  It will not tow  
it back
to Victoria for repair work.  My big question now is....Can anyone  
recommend
a good repair/auto body shop for VW vans in the Vancouver area?
Cheers,
Rhonda
