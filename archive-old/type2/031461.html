&gt; I'd prefer to use a container - preferably a 40' er.

why not use a 20'er, however there are usually a lot of restrictions on
shipping a car &quot;enclosed&quot; such as in a container,  I shipped mine to and
from Germany some years ago in a Roll on Roll off ship. it was reasonable
and except for a dead battery it went fine both ways
