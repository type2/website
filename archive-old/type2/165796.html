&gt; I read here, or on another forum, from someone who stated that with  
&gt; the oil

&gt; completely

&gt; to know
&gt; if that is true, or not, so first of all, is that a fair statement?

The lifters sit in bores and there is some oil between the bore and  
the lifter. The oil gallery pumps oil through the hole in the side  
and the lifter fills up with oil:

&gt; The really crazy part would be, if the engine was overfilled, by a  
&gt; half, or
&gt; even a full quart, does that submerge the lifters completely, and  
&gt; could that
&gt; be a help in preventing them from 'leaking down' and coming out of
&gt; hibernation, in such a bad mood?

No. You might have better luck if you loosen the valve adjustment  
screws before hibernation to remove all pressure from the lifters. Re- 
adjusting them 4-6 months later will only takes 30 mins to do.
