Subject: RE: [T2] '78 Sunroof new owner basics

Hi Joseph,

Welcome to the wonderful world of ACVW ownership!  This List and many of the 
other internet resources like it were the main reasons I bought my Bus a few 
years ago -- there's plenty of knowledge out there, and a 
mechanically-minded person who doesn't mind doing their own work can be very 
empowered.  It sounds like your '67 Rover was a good learning experience.

Here's some basic stuff to start with:
1. Fuel lines -- replace them unless you have proof that they were replaced 
recently (1-3 years).
2. Cooling and air seals -- make sure they're all in place:
A. Foam engine seal
B. Engine hatch seals
C. Tinware -- tight, well-fitting, no pieces missing
3. Tune up -- timing, idle speed, points (if you have them), spark plugs, 
cap, rotor, wires

Here's some stuff for the future:
1. Manuals -- Bentley, Muir, Haynes
2. Gauges (in order of importance):
A. Cylinder Head Temp - 500F is too hot
B. Tachometer - 5,000RPM is too fast
C. Oil Temp - 250F is too hot
D. Oil Pressure - 35PSI is good for highway cruising
3. Bodywork -- rust never sleeps!
4. Rubber brake hoses

As for driving, aircooled VWs need to have all gears used all the time, 
throughout the entire rev range.  When in doubt, downshift -- these engines 
will be hurt more by low-rev lugging than by high-rev winding.  Rev it up 
until it sounds like it's going to fly apart -- the fan spins faster, and 
more cooling air is forced over the heads.  Here's where a tach is helpful.

It sounds like you have yourself a pretty great project, means of transport, 
companion, and source of learning.  Welcome and enjoy!
