Subject: My Westy side tent is backwards

 Hello all!

 I think I asked this a year ago, but I didnt get much of a respo se, so here
 I go.

 The rubber mounting channel on my 70 Westy side tent is upsidedown.  Ive
 checked it with other tents and it is true.  The problem is that it wont
 mount to the bus this way.  I guess thats why it never got that much use
 from previous owners.  

 Anybody have any suggestions on a way to get this thing to mount on the bus?
 Anything other then cutting the channel off and re-stitching it back on the
 right way?  Anybody ever heard of this going on with other tents?
