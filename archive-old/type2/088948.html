Subject: Re: [T2] troubling signs, and other questions (long)

Go to Harbor Freight or a place just like it and buy an inexpensive impact
driver. It comes with screwdriver tips and all you need is a big hammer. Wail
away!

&gt;Also, trying to remove the screws that secure the sheetmetal to the
head has been a royal PITA.  Now I'm left with 2 phillips-head
screws that have the innards stripped out.  I have a set of
easy-outs that, after last weeks thread, have decided to leave alone. I'm
a little nervous about drilling into the head. My latest thought about
this is that I could cut a groove in the screw heads with a dremel and
use a flat screwdriver to remove them.
Any other suggestions?
