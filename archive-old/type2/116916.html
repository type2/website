Subject: pan below pedals

Zach,

I have that part USED pretty straight, they all seem to take a &quot;rock hit&quot; or
two.
I get $25 plus UPS shipping /handling (need zip code)

Does anyone know of where I can get the pan that screws on my 1970 and
protects
the pedal assemblies on the bottom of the car.


&quot;obligatory disclaimer&quot;
I am a &quot;virtual&quot; wrecking yard, selling
GOOD USED PARTS, mostly ORIGINAL STOCK.
These parts are thirty (+/-) years old,
That I pulled from a parts bus or traded...
I would use them on my buses, but they are
USED parts.    &quot;HAPPINESS GUARANTEED&quot;
