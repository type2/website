&gt;I really appreciate the VW part numbers. I have also today tracked down the
&gt;BERU numbers for the BN4 plugs, the spark plug is EBE 514 and the glow plug
&gt;is 140M. Within a few weeks we should have glow, spark  and glow-spark plugs
&gt;in stock for all VW heaters except the B2, which I will work on next.

There are some number in the archives from David Schwarze's group buy back in Apr 2001. The BN4 numbers he listed were GZE 16 and 195GLS for early and late models of the BN4. He also stated that the 195GLS number had been superceeded.

&gt;We have BA6 glow-spark and BN2 glow plugs in stock in limited numbers.

Excellent!
