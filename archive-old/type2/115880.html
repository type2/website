Actually there are a few different sizes. Take one out, go to the 'real'
auto parts store, hand it to the counter person and say I want a pair of
these.  New will probably cost you all of a buck.  You'll need two 900 ones
for the top of the beam and 2 straight ones for the bottom.  Add another 900
for the swing lever pivot. If you're replacing, might as well replace them
all.
