Subject: Re: speaker placement suggestions

Here is what I did as to mounting my two front speakers so as to not have
an ugly set of &quot;non-stock&quot; boxes mounted with the need for bus cutting,
and resultant permanent scar tissue.

I bought a pair of Radio Shack # 12-1724 speakers that are surface mount
design, 3 way bass reflex system.

Remove the stock bus middle speaker mounted under the dash area.

Remove the cool air duct on each of the driver and passenger side.
Drill one hole in each duct so as to secure a speaker to each duct.
Affix the speakers with a lock washer and a dab of thread lock on the
bolts.
Mount the speakers so that they look upward, and the tweeters are on the
inside position of the resultant mount arrangement.
Replace the cool air ducts.
You now have the speakers mounted up front, and unobtrusively placed.

You now have two superb (and cheap) speakers secured up front, pretty much
out of sight, with excellent frequency range, and by having removed the
stock dash mounted speaker, you will also be blasting a good deal  of
audio out of the original speaker grill holes, as well.

Everyone that has seen my speakers has remarked that they were wanting to
do the same thing to their bus.
It really does make for a very clean installation, and they have all of
the bass and treble range that I could ever hope for. They sound truly
excellent.

If you want 4 speakers mounted, mount the other two behind, back in the
camping area, with a single bolt affixing them to the two small
rectangular shaped side ceiling roof panels.
