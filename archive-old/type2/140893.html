Man, you guys are brutal. It's pretty ironic that you as a Bus owner would
critisize a Fiero for catching on Fire. It was ONLY the 1st year Fiero that
had fire problems. 1 out of every 10 connecting rods in the 1984 2.5 L4 had
a hairline fracture, it would cause a piston to go through the side of the
block after 30 some odd thousand miles causing oil to spill on the hot
catalytic converter. This was solved the following year and was never an
issue for later Fieros.

However, ALL Busses are prone to fire hazards.

The 85-88 Fieros were no more or less unreliable than any other car from GM
during the 80s. People always tend to exaggerate things that they know
nothing about. I can't tell you how many people I've had tell me that the
Fiero is dangerous because it flips over when you go fast since the engine
is in the back. People who have never owned one, or even know anyone that
knows anything about them tell me this??? Do they think they're doing me a
service by warning me? Or maybe they're trying to show me their lack of
knowledge. There has never been a single incident in history of a Fiero
flipping over when it goes too fast. Maybe they can tell me that my car's
about to flip over when it's doing 130+ miles an hour down a deserted
highway. I get all kinds of stories from people who have never owned one, or
even been in one, yet everyone seems to be an expert on them. Please
enlighten me as to why??

I've owned 9 Fieros so far, and I've had many with well over 150 thousand
miles on them. One of them I sold with 183 thousand miles on it!

&gt;Have you considered getting a Fiero and rebodying
&gt;it as an X-1/9...?-)

&gt;
&gt;Have you seen a Fiero that has not had an engine fire
&gt;lately??
&gt;
&gt;At least the X1/9-Bertones did not go up in flames!
