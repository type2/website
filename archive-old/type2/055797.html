Subject: FS: 71 Westy in eastern NC

71 Westfalia, seems to be complete, a little rough overall, but little
rust.  $1000

While working in wonderful eastern NC, I saw this bus for sale at a house
on US 117, one mile North of Calypso, NC (about 25 miles south of
Goldsboro.)  I don't know if it runs, there was no one home when I stopped
by.  Send me an e-mail for more info...
