3.)Unrelated.  How in the _at_#$# do i get the stripped to a coneshape oil
drain plug out?.... Visegrips just slip off and take a little metal with
them.  I have a replacement, but can't get the bugger off.



Use a die grinder and cut a slot in it, then use a BIG screw driver or
impact screwdriver. Or grind two flats on it and use Vise Grips. Use a
chisel and beat it counter clockwise to remove or loosen it. Arc/Mig weld a
larger nut to it and then put a wrench on that to remove. Drill a small hole
in the end just till you break through the nut, then heat it with propane to
hot, not red, then apply parafin wax and allow to cool. Then use one of the
above methods to grip it. Your tools will determin the best one of these for
you.
Most of all, be very carefull and do not strike this nut with a hammer, you
do not want to damage the stud. You must split the case to remove this stud.
