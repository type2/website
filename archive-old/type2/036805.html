Subject: jalousie window rubbers

Hey guys/gals
I've had a lot of comments on my interior window rubbers on my jals in
Stella.  You know..the big fat gray ones.  Not many people seem to have
these so they inquire about them.  I've seen a few around here...but not
too many.  All of the bay window westies I've owned (2 of them) have had
them.  Stella has them...as did my old 69.  Anyone know if these were an
option or something??

anything on them?

thanks
