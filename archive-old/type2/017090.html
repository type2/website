&gt; &lt;&lt;    I have a 66' splittie and I need to put a couple of new windshields in.
&gt;  I have tried the wire and liquid soap thing but the seal is different from a
&gt;  bug and it isn't very easy. Any suggestions? This is kind of urgent I need
&gt;  to cover the two big holes in the front if you know what I mean.
&gt; 
&gt;  Thanks,

&gt; What type of wire are you using?I use 1/4 inch braded nylon rope and liquid
&gt; dishsoap.It definately helps to have someone apply pressure to the area the
&gt; rope is at to help keep things moving along smoothly.Also make sure to pull
&gt; the rope at an angle so as not to tear the rubber.

Dave, Frank:
In real life I'm an electrical contractor, so whenever I'm at a loss in
a makeshift situation I use what comes naturally to hand- wire.
What I've used is #12 THHN which is regular commercial- industrial wire
that goes into conduit. THHN is a nylon thermoplastic insulating jacket
that is real shiny and slippery (slides into those pipes really nicely).
It has also worked better than anything else I've ever used to put in
rubber mounted glass. It's thick enough to not cut the lip of the rubber
and tough enough not to get cut by the pinchweld. I like solid rather
than stranded because it'll hold the shape it's bent to.
You still need at least one helper to push while you pull the wire out
and the rubber lip over the metal. I start in the lower center and work
out and up evenly. Remember, GLASS DOESN'T LIKE TO BEND so go easy and
evenly. I also have a Somaca glass installing tool which is nice. It's a
nylon heavy duty tongue depressor that's tapered on the ends.
