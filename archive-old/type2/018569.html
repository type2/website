Does anyone know offhand what the bolt circle diameter is for our 5 bolt
wheels on a late model bay window?  I've got access to a laser cutter
this weekend to cut out a custom spare tire carrier and I don't know
this dimension.  I know, I know; don't put it in front, but the holes
are already there and I do like the 'look'.
