Subject: Westy Drive-away Tent - For Sale

For Sale:  Original drive-away tent from a 73 Westy.  $550 + shipping from
U.S. zip code 80921.  

Excellent condition complete with original poles (still have red and green
tape on them).  Includes original bags for tent and for poles and what I
believe are the original ropes and some of the original stakes.

This tent was bought new with the 73 Westy I just sold.  I've recently sold
the bus, but the buyer didn't want the tent (he already had one).  It's in
excellent condition except that the rubber part that attaches to the
drip-rail on the bus has come loose for about 1 foot at either end and one
of the rubber eyelets for staking the tent to the ground has come un-glued
(not torn, just not attached). 

Shipping will be high because it weighs a freaking TON.  If you can make any
sort of arrangements to pick it up in the Denver/Colorado Springs Colorado
area it'll save you a bundle on shipping AND I'll discount it $50 if I don't
have to mess with boxing it up.

Please let me know off-list.  I'm having trouble with the filters at my work
address so you might want to cc me at vwzorm58_at_hotmail_dot_com just to be sure I
get your email.  $25 from this sale will be donated to the type2 list

Thanks.
