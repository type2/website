hi, welcome to the list.

...part 1 ....

1.  look inside on the door post, on the dashboard, in the engine
compartment and try to find the bus serial number.  should begin with a
2xx xxx xxx, in the USA most common is 211 but there are others.

2.  look on the rear of the engine, top right side for flat engine, on the
generator stand for upright engines

now contact Ron at Bus Depot (he's on the list)  and get the correct
Bentley manual for your bus.  also get the Muir book &quot;Idiots guide&quot;

--- 
 now you are ready to begin thinking about what you need to do...


to be continued

Bob
