Looks like I might be getting that gas heater that fellow listee Seth had up
for grabs. Looks like there is lots of info in the archives and library.
Seth said the PO had it running and it sounds like its in great shape.
$75.00 sounds like a fair price.
I've learned that this is the model that is housed in the engine
compartment, and has a push/pull switch. However before he ships it are
there any gas heater gurus out there that know of any problems associated
with this model and will it fit into my (for now ,Weber carburated) 1978
Bus?

Any advice appreciated.
