Subject: radio repair

My new 78 passenger bus is now inspected and on the road. Only short trips
so far though, I was going to drive the great pumpkin (white over orange
repaint) to work but it was too cold and I haven't hooked up the heater
blower yet. It was in the 20s this morning. Anyway it still has the
original radio which doesn't work, though I verified 12V to it. I searched
the archives and came up with Brad Clausen and his VW radio repair, but his
last post was in 99 and his homepage link doesn't work. Are you out there
Brad? If not, any other suggestions?

I'll add a personal experience to the front mounted spare thread. Leaving a
dead show in NJ, late at night, someone up ahead in the line of cars
decided they did not want to be on this ramp and stopped, along with
everyone else. We were traveling at 30-35MPH, slammed on the brakes and hit
the back of the Ford Ranger in front of us, that had no rear bumper. All
contact was between his tailgate and our front mounted spare. The whole
nose was pushed in about 3 inches, lifting the steering column up enough
that the splined end came disconnected near the steering box and there was
a gap at the lower edge of the windshield (didn't break though). With the
help of a garage I was able to put spacers between the column mounting and
the dash and drive home with the steering wheel almost dragging on the dash
face. Oh and duct tape covering the gap at the windshield bottom.

What would have happened without the spare there? I guess the tailgate
would have distributed the force across the whole front end, crushing the
headlights, but probably not moving the sheetmetal/dash as much.  The spare
is back on the front, although I did pick up a BroncoII hinged rear spare
mount that I haven't figured out how to put on my bus yet, or if I want to.
