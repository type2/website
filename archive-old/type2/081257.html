Subject: Is this the right clutch?

   Hi All.

   Just recieved a clutch disk that I ordered  for my 1700cc 73 bus and =
am confused in that the clutch disk measures exactly 200mm in diameter.
The correct disk is a 210mm disk. Question is do I have the right one?
  My bus is still in storage so I havn't pulled the old clutch out yet =
to compare.
   The disk has the name LUK on it as well as the # 215 03 if that =
matters.
Also it is a 4 spring clutch.=20
  The supplier I bought it from thinks it is correct and I believe him =
but just wanted to make sure.

Thanks for all replies.
