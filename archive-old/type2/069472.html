FWIW, I just remembered that I used to live next door to the NAPA
NAt'l Headquarters.  I called them last.
They have a $30.00US    1 13/16&quot;  (which ought to be close enough
to 46mm to not matter)...

I allways hammer my nuts off :-)  That's all those air wrenches that 
those macho guys at the tire changing shops do.  They don't deliver
so much torque, the vibrate the sucker off.  I think :-)
