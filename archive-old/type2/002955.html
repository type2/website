Subject: pre-'71 tail light

I ordered two repro tail lights for my 68 in January from Ron. I got the
last ONE he had in stock, and his source had dried up. But today, after
working in the rain all day, I came home and found 2 boxes from Bus Depot.
One had some bug parts, the other the long-backordered tail light! Thanks
Ron!

Talk about brightening my day (Christmas in September)! Must be from a
different source, it appears to be of much heavier stock then the first one.
If you need (want) these, I'd advise you to check with Ron ASAP.

I know why it finally came...just this weekend we were talking about pulling
the original one off and trying some chrome silver spray paint on the
reflector.

Finally, two BRIGHT tail lights! Now if it would just stop raining so I can
put it on the bus (it ALWAYS rains when the state fair is in town).
