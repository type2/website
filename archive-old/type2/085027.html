Subject: Various MC notes for conversion to bay unit

A few notes on the conversion of the single chamber MC in the split to a
later disk brake baywindow MC.

Eric &amp; Barb have a great write-up on this process in the Library section.
Please be familiar with that article to get an idea of what I am doing the
same or differently than they outline.

Also note this is not installed yet and the actual installation will take
place in a few weeks when other associated front brake parts arrive.

Okay I am starting with a Wolfgang International conversion kit (Part Number
2611011 www.wolfgangint_dot_com ).  I spoke with Steve there who was very
helpful in comparing the information Eric&amp;Barb gave to what this kit either
eliminates or makes more complicated.  The kit is basically a spacer for the
MC so that the piston rod does not need to be altered and matching longer
bolts.  This keeps all of the components as stock as possible if you decide
to switch back to the single chamber MC.

Some list members have said they have gotten this same kit locally at their
VW FLAPS, but I have never seen this kit outside of the Wolfgang webpage.  I
assumed it was an EMPI part, but it is not in their 2001 dealer catalog
either.   

The largest difference in Eric&amp;Barbs instructions is that Wolfgang
recommends removing the front brake light sensor and putting the front line
directly in that hole.  This eliminates the need for a &quot;T&quot; fitting.  We will
see what happens when I install it...

As I previously mentioned the Porsche 924 fluid reservoir is a perfect fit
for this application and holds more fluid than the Rabbit fluid holder...
This is what happens when you hang out in the junkyard too much :)

The final plan entails the addition of early Porsche 944 front disc brakes
to my '66.  The calipers are the easiest to rebuild and use that I have ever
seen!  The rotors are massive at 11+ some odd inches (same rotors on the
911) and should provide enough grip to embarrass some SUVs.   Please contact
Old Speed http://www.oldspeed_dot_com/service.htm for more information, they
have been very helpful.  Also if anyone is interested I have extra front
calipers and good used rotors left over, make me a reasonable offer and yes
it is WAY less than Old Speed would charge.  The kit gets cheap when you
supply your own stuff :)

The rear brakes are still a puzzle I am trying to put together.  For the
short term I will try the EMPI adapter plates to Porsche 5 lug, but it is a
poor long term solution.  Really want to install 944 rear brakes and 944 MC,
but have not found a good way yet w/o serious and expensive changes....  At
stock height with 215/75R15 tires...  Yah that is the killer, if I wanted 3&quot;
drop it would be a very easy conversion.  

Hopefully this post will be inspirational and thought provoking to someone
out there ;)


Happy &amp; Safe Journeys,
