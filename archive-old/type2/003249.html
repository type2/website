Jack, the 34Pict3 will work.  however, you must jet it!  If you try and run
it stock  the 1776 will run too lean.  as in destroy your new engine.

I ran a 34PICT3 [jetted] on a 1776 in a 69 bus that was used to drive up and
down the Baja California Peninsula [delivering supplies for my sons, surf
shop] to San Jose Del Cabo Mexico, from San Diego Cal, [1,100 miles each
way] under  EXTREME driving conditions. it's hard to believe, but a 55
gallon drum of resin, just fits standing upright through the side slider.
had 0 problems with engine performance!  When the bus was sold about 5 years
ago had over 150,000 miles on the engine and it was still running strong....

&gt; We are being treated to a preview of winter in Northern VA this weekend.
&gt; The 1776 with dual Kadrons which I inherited from the PO of my '71 Westy,
&gt; and which I rebuilt over the past nine months, does not seem to like cool
&gt; weather.  A good deal of popping for the first five minutes after startup.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  I need a choke.  I'm considering removing the Kadrons and putting on the
&gt; 34 PICT-3 which I have in my pile.  I'm sure this will reduce the power a
&gt; bit but I'm hoping the startability and driveability will more than make
up
&gt; for that.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone run this combination? Any advice?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks, Jack
&gt;
