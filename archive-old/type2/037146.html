Subject: 72 Windsheild Wipers

Before I removed my windshield wipers, motor and all from my bus for the
paint job everything worked fine. I installed it the other day to find
that the left outer shaft moves along with the inner shaft. I say inner
and outer because it seams as if the right has a moving center that
drives the blade, and the outer threaded portion stays put.
The left one now turns both the inner and the outer shaft, along with
the bolt when the motor is turned on.
Any one know what might have happened and how to fix it.
Thanks
Meredith
