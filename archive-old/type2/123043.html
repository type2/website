&gt; Spoke with Chris at CIP.  He confirmed that the shocks they sent me were

&gt; Chris said that it's not usual to need to compress the suspension to install
&gt; shocks.  Sound right?

Compress shock, yes.  Compress suspension, no.

It could be as simple as a broken/misaligned suspension stop, though.
