I was tuning up my 75 camoper the other day and
couldn't figure why my dwell was so seemed high when
it idled well etc. So I messed w/the setting on my
multitester (dwell/idle) and then realized it wasn't
grounded well. Now my tester is adjusted incorrectly. 
I plan on taking the van for a 600 mile trip this
weekend.  Seem to be running well, has a slight
gurgle/exhaust leak sound when downshifting.  Timing
is spot on 0 degrees as set by my engine rebuilder.
Any reccommedations on how to reset the meter. 
Otherwise I am going to drive as is until I can hook
up w/someone who has a meter for me to check against. 
Look for me on Friday and Sunday on I66 and I81 down
to Roanoke from Annapolis, Md.
