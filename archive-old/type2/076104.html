Subject: Re: [T2] Re: oil filter cross reference

/sarcasm/

Fram does list an oil filter for a type IV motor, but trust me, they
don't make a type IV filter. 

/end sarcasm/

If you're going to use a Fram filter on your bus, I might suggest Kragen
tune-up parts and Pep Boys tires also. You can also save a few more
bucks using Arco fuel.
