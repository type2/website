Subject: Re: [T2] read side marker light source?

CIP1 has them. I bought two of them, but ended up sending them back. They
don't fit the curve of the body- i.e. they are too flat and the plastic tabs
that hold them on wouldn't engage. I don't know the manufacturer, but they
were from china. They could probably be modified to work (maybe some small
through bolts or pop rivets instead of trying to make the tabs engage). I
ended up using my old ones; the 26 year old german parts were better than
brand new chinese. The lenses fit OK, though, and they have the silver
frame, so they are correct for the '72.
