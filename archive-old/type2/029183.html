Being a SW NH resident, I'd be interested in this info also. The only VW
junkyard I'm familiar with in VT is John's Car Corner in Westminster VT
which is a guy that likes and sells used VWs, and does some work on them,
and has junkers. He prioritizes his operation in that order. I have found
good stuff there, but it comes and goes quite a bit.

I have heard about a VW junkyard on Rt 5 in MA somewhere near Yankee Candle
from the in-laws. Unfortunately the better half finds visiting junkyards
depressing whereas I could spend a whole weekend in a good junkyard just
wandering and poking around :-)
