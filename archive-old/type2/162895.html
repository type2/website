Subject: exotic elec interaction cracked

&gt;At 5 am in pouring rain, the wipers on my '73 Devon failed.  In what 
&gt;seemed at first merely a cruel coincidence, the headlights also 
&gt;failed: sidelights were available, but no headlights except the full 
&gt;beams by holding the dip/turn lever up continuously. My 
&gt;quartz-halogen full beams offpissed quite a few drivers coming the 
&gt;other way, so I let go of the lever when they flashed their full 
&gt;beams at me.
&gt;	Then I noticed that the wipers would come back on every 
&gt;*second* haul on the dip/turn lever.  Still no dipped beams  ...
&gt;	It's as if the dip control works thru a relay that has 
&gt;somehow become connected to the wiper control circuit.

	Earth {&quot;ground&quot;} fault, eh?  Thorough checking failed to 
reveal any.  Worse, the fault refused to manifest  ...  solution 
turned out to be a switch problem!
		The ignition key has 3 or 4 vague positions, 
augmented by a toggle switch in the dash to turn the ignition on, and 
a starter button in the dash.  The lo-beam headlights, and the 
wipers, both fail to work unless the key is turned to the vaguely 
defined 3rd position  ...
	Ah well, at least we cracked it  ...
