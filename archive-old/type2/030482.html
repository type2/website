Hi Dan, and listees,

there seems to be a pretty substantial contingent of vintage vw
enthusiasts around the south bay, but a lot of the bussers are not on the
list. I keep thinking I should make up some little Type2_dot_com cards to
stick under the wipers of busses I encounter while driving around...
Any of the graphics artist folks out there wanna design up a really
cool card that all the listees could use?

The lemon and white squareback &quot;lives&quot; a few blocks from me, parked on the
street... it is frequently visited by an assortment of interesting other
veedubs, most recently an immaculate green/white bay window that had a for
sale sign in the window... unfortunately, I was late for work, and
couldn't stop to check it out :-( But I'll keep an eye out for it.
