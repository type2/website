Subject: Re: [T2] online parts shops

I just want to share a little online shopping experience I went through
today which relates to this original post.

I have a new 2 liter I am putting in my bus so I am going with the bigger
clutch. I also needed the flywheel. I need to have it this weekend so I can
drive again!!

I have used many of the online stores, probably all of them. Nobody
mentioned GoWesty in this thread but they are the only ones who had what I
needed in house and could ship it today. I have found lots of places say
they have to get it in and it would be at least 2 days before they could
ship it. GoWesty is a shop too so they have a lot of stuff right there.

Synopsis..I am calling GoWesty first from now on.
Here is the link to shop online at GoWesty:
www.gowesty_dot_com
They have more than their catalog shows, so call them if you can't find it.

&gt; Highly recommended online parts shops, in no particular order:
&gt; http://www.aircooled_dot_net/
&gt; http://www.bus-boys_dot_com/
&gt; http://www.bustedbus_dot_com/
&gt; http://www.type2parts_dot_com/
&gt; http://www.busdepot_dot_com/
&gt;
&gt; All of these regularly post on this list, have used a few myself, been
&gt; pleased with results, value vs. cost.  But, opinions vary!  I hope this
&gt; thread doesn't turn into a bash-fest.
&gt;
&gt; Also, check the type2 archives for the previous conversations on this
&gt; subject...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Have fun,

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm curious as to what online sites everyone around here uses for bus
&gt; &gt; parts.
&gt; &gt; I'm looking for the best combination of quality and price.  Any
suggestions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Brian
