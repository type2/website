Hi Courtney,

I acquired a '71 Westfakia in May this this year.  I had constant trouble with
the battery running down.  Last weekend a friend of a friend who's an auto
electrician offered to take a look.  I knew there was an electrical leak
somewhere, because the earth strap in the engine compartment would create a
spark when connecting it to the battery. Turns out the problem was the CD/MP3
player.  The red and yellow wires had been wired together on a constant
supply, and were drawing 0.3amps with the radio off!  I now have a simple
toggle switch on the dash to turn the radio on and off - and no more flat
batteries ;-)

Bottom line is, you don't want to wire the red and yellow together - unless
you want to re-charge your battery every week.

Happy tunes ;-)
Bruce
