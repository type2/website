Subject: And the survey says...
Message-ID: &lt;376ACE7E.186DEBFA_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;

Okay Volks,

Here's the data.  It was a rough day at the orfice today, and I gotta get this
out while it's still Friday so I'll just give you the raw data and those who
are interested can further reduce it...


MACHINES
PCs     =    49
Macs    =    45
Other*  =    21

USERS
PC      =    39
Mac     =    27
Other   =     8


* Category &quot;Other&quot; includes: Linux, HP, Ataris, a Victor 9000, O/S2 , WebTV
and a couple of Sun workstations. 

The greatest number of operational, in-use machines claimed by one respondent
was 5 Linux systems.

And yes, I know that most Linux systems are run on PCs, but for the purpose of
the survey, I chose to call them &quot;Other&quot;.  If you don't like it, run your own
survey... ;o)
