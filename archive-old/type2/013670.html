That placard is telling you that you're driving on dangerous tires, if
your tires won't meet the minimum or recommended inflation then you're
crushing for trouble.
You need a tire with a C load rating (thats minimum).
I understand that there are several economical tires that meet this
requirement.
Discount tire just installed a set of 4 Agilis 61 Michelin tires on my
van after my insistence that they were first in line for litigation if I
had an accident resulting from tire failure. I had to put some money with
the exchange but I feel much better about my vehicle safety.

&gt; Quick question for all about the tire pressure. If the placard in the 
&gt; bus
&gt; wants 40psi and the tires are only rated for 35psi max, do I only 
&gt; inflate to
&gt; the 35psi or should I go ahead and inflate to 40psi?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
