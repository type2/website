Subject: Re: transmission of mystery

Jeff,
&gt; noises were loudest in reverse and were coming from the upper front of
&gt; the transmission (where the gears live). When I changed the oil in the
&gt; gearbox, there were no chunks or even slivers of metal to be found. So,
&gt; here is my conclusion: it's not good.

That sounds like what happened to my tranny (on my '69). I had to replace
it. They don't give much for the 5.375R&amp;P cores, and I forgot what year
yours is, but you might want to forfeit the $75 core to keep your tranny and
&quot;learn&quot; something about it.

&gt; If anyone has an opinion on
&gt; whether I should buy I good used or rebuilt transmission I'd love to
&gt; hear why and where I could find one.

I usually don't put in a plug for &quot;one time&quot; vendors, but I got my rebuilt
one from KCR (he advertises in Hot VWs), and it's working fine. I personally
wouldn't go for a used one.

Good luck -
