Thanks for the reply - you're right, the deck height, is just a number
and it is the compression ration that matters except as an indicator that
you have enough clearance for ensuring the the valves do not hit the
pistons (although if the heads have been surfaced, then this can be a
false indicator)

I still have a few questions - head volume - how do you measure? -Do use
use water? Also when the heads are rebuilt, I would envision that the
valves and guides are replaced, maybe some carbon deposits cleaned up,
but is really anthing done that would change the head volume? Only
resurfacing the face where the cylinders lie would change the
compression. A slight resurfacing would have little effect on the C.R.  
It seems that any work would increase the head volume, effectively
decreasing the compression ratio.  One final note -my replacement Mahle
stock pistons,  as well as the old ones,  have a dish in them. 

(I did a calculation and found that a 0.020&quot; reduction in deck height
would change the C.R. from 7.4: 1 to 7.7 :1)

&gt;The deck ht is just a number. All by itself it means nothing. Only if
&gt;you are putting back the exact, unmachined parts (heads, rods, crank)
&gt;will it be ok to do nothing. If the heads were rebuilt they may (will)
&gt;have different volumes in the combustion chambers and this volume must
&gt;be measured and calculations done to keep your compression ratio low.
&gt;If you are using different pistons that have a dish in them then that
&gt;must be considered too. If you want your engine to live you are going
&gt;to have to measure and make calculations. The last engine I built
&gt;would have had a compression ratio of about 8.7 if I had not done the
&gt;calculations and used the correct shim between the cylinders and
&gt;block. Keep the compression ratio at or lower then stock.
