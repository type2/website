I think I had something similar.  I changed the alternator on my 76 FI
and the sound went away.

&gt; My 2.0 1978 Bus has developed a sound that is best described as a squealing
&gt; fan belt or a giant cricket. Having dismissed the latter for obvious reasons
&gt; and then the first by removing the fan belt - the sound persists.
&gt; I know this is hard to diagnose by just my description but is this something
&gt; any of you recognize as an obvious warning sound?
&gt; 
&gt; I replaced a pilot bearing this summer that was worn to the sleeve - no
&gt; bearings left. I have been suspicious as to why this would happen and am now
&gt; paranoid that it is grinding down the new one. The play in the transmission
&gt; shaft was minimal (tiny wobble)  and I didn't check my end play (curses!).
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from the noise, performance is good.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help appreciated.
