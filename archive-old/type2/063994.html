Thanks for posting this.  Today I realized I had forgotten to get the 
title for my '66 so I called up Edith and it seems that bad house fire 
about 15 years ago ate it up.  No problem though.  Within 10 minutes she 
called me back to say that the courthouse only had one title for a 1966 
VW &quot;SW&quot; with the number 246009127.  The &quot;SW&quot; meant Station Wagon.  I told 
Edith that must be it.

Now, this means obviously that I have a Type ][ made in 1966, however, 
what does the &quot;4&quot; correspond to?  I would assume a Deluxe, correct?
Maybe someone has the list of these?  Lemme know if you do.

Thanks again...this info was a big help to me...
