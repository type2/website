I wrote up an article on the 70A version that explains what's different:

http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Alternator.html

&gt; All else being equal, I'd prefer the Bosch rebuilt one. But if the  
&gt; few bucks
&gt; difference will affect you then get a local lifetime warranty one from
&gt; Autozone or Kragen or whatever. Cheaper and when it dies (and it  
&gt; will) you
&gt; have a local source to return it to.

Local rebuilders will save you the shipping cost of acquiring your  
alternator and dealing with the core fee and shipping costs but I've  
found that you have to ask them specifically what they will test and  
replace. Sometimes they don't have the parts for your alternator. For  
example, say you need new slip rings and they don't have any?

One local shop uses NTN bearings from USA/Canada another uses  
Chinese. etc.

&gt; Now, after all that.... What's wrong with your alt? If it just isn't
&gt; charging, try replacing the brushes. They're just a few bucks and  
&gt; it's worth
&gt; it if you can save your good quality alternator.

FYI,

- alternators don't come with the pulley or backing plate
- Bosch warranty is good
- Bus Depot's photo of the AL108X is wrong
- Autozone sells Bosch reman products
