Subject: FW: getting in to locked bus

Hi Mike,

I think you might be able to grab the bottom of the latches and twist them
around if you had a set of pliers and remembered which way to turn them.

This would never work with my bus, I leave too many toolboxes and things
back there.

.... It's not just a mess, it's also an anti-theft device!

I've jimmied lots of automotive door locks (not for profit, just for
stupidity, I'll have you know!) but the case in question here WASN'T me.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; If the upper engine hatch is latched correctly, how can you get in
&gt; throught it?  You need not break a window- if a louvre window is open,
&gt; push a screen corner out and reach either the door button or the sliding
&gt; door lock.  If closed and you have pull up lock buttons, get a coat
&gt; hanger or piece of house wiring and either a small prybar or giant
&gt; screwdriver.  Gently pry the front door  away from the door post just
&gt; below the top corner, and reach the wire through the gap, having bent a
&gt; loop in it to grip the door locking knob.

&gt;&gt; Hi Mike,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; One of the members of a local VW club locked himself out of his 1974 bus
&gt;&gt; recently at the side of the road, and he actually managed to re-enter the
&gt;&gt; bus through the rear and upper engine hatches!!!
