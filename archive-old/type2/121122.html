Subject: Re: [T2] Engine Removal article

I have to agree with Scott here.  It is *much* easier to remove the 
engine if you allow the tranny to drop too.  That way you don't have to 
remove any tin at all.  Makes for a very quick removal.

However, Scott, I've never loosened the shift rod from the transmission. 
  Have I been killing that joint by not undoing it, or does it have a 
little bit of flex?

Nice work documenting the proccess, Richard!

thanks,
Mike


&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; Very good work on the web page, as usual. You are a great &quot;documentarian&quot; of
&gt; all things relating to your bus, and it is very helpful to others.
&gt; 
&gt; I must say though, that steps 11-14 are not necessary. I never take any of
&gt; those parts off the engine, except the coil. You have to remove the two
&gt; bolts that hold the transmission bell housing to the upper trans mounts on
&gt; the frame, as well as disconnecting the shift rod from the transmission.
&gt; Then the entire engine/trans assembly will pivot downward and then the
&gt; engine will slide off the trans easily. Food for thought.
