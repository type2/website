&gt; Someone mentioned camber and tow settings.  The last time I took my
'73 Westphalia to the

old for them to have

weight, has different
&gt; settings than a standard loaf of the same year.  Does anyone know
what the settings for a
&gt; '73 camper are?  I'll write them down and confound the guys at Les
Schwab next time...

Toe-in (wheels not pressed) 0 to 30 minutes or 0-1/8 inch

Toe-in (wheels pressed together with 33 pounds of force) 4.75 - 5.25
degrees

Camber (wheels straight ahead)  20-60 minutes, no more than 30 minutes
difference between sides

Caster 3.0 degrees plus or minus 40 minutes

Happy aligning!'
