Looking for a real tool to remove aux heater switches, light switches, etc
from the dash...you know the ones that have the slit in them about the size
of a dime.....I have made things that work at mediocre level at best, and am
looking for a real, manufactured tool for this job.

Any leads would be appreciated.
