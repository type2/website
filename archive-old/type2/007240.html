Subject: Re: gas leak, 78, NEED ADVICE

In my own experience after filling the tank to the top and driving it I would
get leakage due to the fact that I parked sideways on a hill with the gas tank
facing down. Turns out the seal on the gas cap isn't as good as it could be and
gas was leaking past the seal. If this is the case with your bus (the leakage is
only after filling up, your seal isn't the best, only leaks while parked on
hills) either get a new gas cap or don't fill the tank so much or don't park on
hills. If this isn't the problem then I don't know what to say.

OK, here's the background.  Bought a 78 in Feb, it smelled of gas.
Searched, found leaky inlet/outlet tubes on gas tank, and eventually
got around to replacing the tank.  Filled up after doing the
replacement, still smelled gas, but couldn't locate where.  Filler
neck, tank inlet/outlet, gas lines, all were dry.  The odor *seemed*
to come from left fender/aux. battery tray area, but it was faint and
I couldn't nail it down.

This morning, I filled my tank for the second time since the tank
replacement.  This evening as I'm leaving work, I do the usual drip
check as I walk past (leaks oil too).  A little spot under left rear
fender--hmmm.  Smell it, smells like gas.  Hmmm...  Open engine hatch,
look over to the left--F*****K!  The whole aux battery tray is full of
gasoline about 1/8&quot; deep!  I guess the act of opening the hatch got
some gas sloshing in the tank, and at that point, gas just started
POURING out of the left fender into the tray.  Not trickling down the
inside of the fender, but actually *pouring* into the tray and
splashing around.

Okay, now what do I do?  The only thing related to gasoline in that
area is the vapor recovery siphon-break thingy.  As far as I know,
that tubing (which goes from the left side of the gas tank compartment
up into the fender, down again and across the rear of the engine
compartment) is all one piece--yes or no?  Where could it be leaking
from?  Is that siphon-break tubing REPLACABLE?

Secondly, it's supposed to be a VAPOR recovery system, not a liquid
gas recovery system.  What the heck is going wrong here???  Yes, this
is the dented tank I mentioned earlier today in a post about the gas
gauge.

Any and all help very much appreciated!
Rodney
