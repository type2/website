&gt; the
&gt; door handle is frozen and I can't get back in - of course all my keys are in

&gt; ther and I have no way of getting in

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Right now the key is in the on position, and the coil wire is pulled - is
&gt; there any harm in leaving it like this for a few hours (other than a dead
&gt; battery)?

&gt; Anyway be thankful if you don't have to live with these kind iof

It did get nearly that cold here in Iowa December 25 -29 F. is -34 C.
I've had a lot of experience using bay window vans in extreme cold. Luckily, my
daily driver now is a Vanagon Diesel and it's the best heater I've ever had,
even without the auxiliary heater (DA-6) turned on. Bays spoiled me for
traction, though and a Vanagon really needs 200-300 lbs in the back to act right
in the slippery conditions.
Door handles: I take them apart and load the plunger/ return spring area with
light Lubriplate engine assembly lube- it's pretty waterproof and stays soft at
low temps.
Gearboxes: I really like synthetic gear oil, works good when it's cold,  no more
stiff trannys or crunching.
Frozen throttle bodies: FI type 2's have often done this and I believe it's the
blowby that contains a lot of water vapor (one of the main byproducts of
combustion) recycled onto the throttle body from the crankcase breather that
causes it to ice up. After the engine is warmed up this is not a problem, really
only when starting. So, you need to change your routine a little and work the
throttle several times or even work it from the engine compartment to get ot
unstuck first.
As to damage, yes, if the points were closed, and there's a 60-75 percent chance
they were, the points are burned. Very slight chance the coil burned out, but
not likely. If it ever happens again, also take off one of the wires to the
coil, the one from the points (distributor) would be best 'cause it's not hot.
Days like this really make one appreciate the balmy 20's and 30's (F) that are
to follow!
