&gt; As spring approaches here in Minnesota, I'm planning to pull the engine in

ah the rites of spring, I got tranny work to do on mine

&gt; my '79 Deluxe Westy to install a new clutch.  I've pulled engines from bugs,
&gt; but this is my first bus. On my bugs I had to get the rear of the car pretty
&gt; high in the air to clear the rear apron.  Bently doesn't mention needed to
&gt; raise the rear of my bus.  I've searched the archives and have found

the good news and the bad news,  a type 4 engine is not as tall as the
type 1 engine so the bus doesn't have to go up anywhere near as far. I
usually find 10-12 inches enough.

the BAD news.  that engine is about twice as heavy as the type 1 engine,
so a simple jack may not be quite enough, also until you get the trick
down an extra body is sure helpful to.

don't forget to pull your
. coil  
. oil filler tube

these WILL get in the way, mark all the wires and hoses. I use a drop of
paint. white to white blue to blue etc on all the wires and hoses.

also helps to take the rear tin (3 pieces) off before removing, not
mandatory but helps a lot. don't forget to take the accelerator linkage
off and push it through the hole. (ask me how I know about this)

&gt; conflicting info, not to mention about 30 different methods of removal.  I'm
&gt; going with the &quot;unbolt engine/slide straight back/lower using floor jack&quot;
&gt; method that I'm used to from my past bugs.  Not looking to start an engine

not sure if there is enough room to come all the way back, you may have to
tilt a little (I have an automatic slightly different pull out) some
people swear by dropping the tranny rear a little but I do it the same as
you have planned.

&gt; One more question, on an unrelated note:  It seems to take along time for my
&gt; engine to return to idle speed.  I searched the archives and most of the
&gt; posts pointed to the AFM, but I recently installed a rebuilt unit from Bus

hmmm, check to see if your accel linkage is binding up or your return
spring may be weak. I agree with you this does not sound like an AFM
