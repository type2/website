&gt; I went to my vw FLAPS and picked up a new bowden tube because my
&gt; originals were gettin' kinda nasty.  I noticed that it's slightly longer
&gt; (about 3/4cm) and therefore has a bigger bend.  The cable doesn't have
&gt; any major kinks and runs in a smooth curve.  Pedal action is nice and
&gt; smooth...
&gt; 
&gt; Think this will be ok or am I looking at frequent cable breaks?

Bentley says 25-45mm. I'd like to know more specifics also. The picture in
Bentley doesn't really match the way the front of the bowden tube engages
the metal tube the clutch cable sits in. I see more of an S-shape.
