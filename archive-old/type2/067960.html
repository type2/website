Subject: RE: Friday Bus fantasy

Well this is sort of a day-dream, sci-fi, VW bus fantasy...

The year is 2096.  Human #5897KG (affectionately known as KG by friends) is
traveling along one of the last remaining public roads in the U.S. (actually
an old service road near a condemned nuclear power plant) in his hippyed-out
2057 VW Africavan.  The Africavan was the last of the type II models made by
VW of Rwanda.  (VW of Germany failed in 1999 when the German mark was
devalued severely after the world's currency began being backed by
fossilized Martian bacteria).

KG sees a somewhat familiar sight as he glances through the split-screen
electro-visor windshield of his Africavan, something he's seen in one of his
old type II history books.  He stops the bus, and waits for the cold fusion
boosters to cool off before opening the gullwing driver's door.  His
Africavan is a Swahili camper conversion, in the fine tradition of the now
defunct Westfalia converters, so he has the camperdome side-room option
which he erects by mentally communicating with the virtual reality ECU.
After glancing at the temp guage on the hot tub in the camperdome to make
sure it is warm enough when he returns, he heads through the brush, toward
what looks to be a vanagon body buried in nuclear waste.

KG ponders whether it's worth the risk to wade through the waste to pick
over the obsolete vanagon wreck.  After a slight hesitation, he's crawling
under the bus shoeing away the nuclea-rats that built a home in the heater
ductwork.  &quot;Wow, this must be one of those rare Syncro models!!&quot;  KG sees a
part that was alluded to in his VW history book, but he can't believe his
eyes as he reaches out to touch it--&quot;It's...it's a viscous coupling!&quot;

KG mentally contacts his tool robot (stored in a trap door of the
Africavan's bellypan) and the robot soon has the viscous coupling removed
and in the part analyzer.  &quot;I can't believe it, it's fully functional!!&quot;  KG
knows he can get a king's randsom in fossilized Martian bacteria for this
piece at the swap meet, but he decides instead to make a retro-custom mod to
his Africavan.  He programs the tool robot for the modifications necessary
and the robot busily begins incorporating the viscous coupling into the
Africavan.  KG takes a quick dip in the hot tub and then fires down the road
to seek out fellow bus nuts to admire his modification.

KG pulls up to his friend, BA6's, place and briefly admires the fiberglas
baywindow bus custom kit mounted on the newer Toyota Landcruiser XIII
chassis.  &quot;Hey, BA6, checkout the new mod I made on my Swahily...Dood!&quot;
They both laugh sheepishly.  &quot;Dude&quot; is one of those retro terms that their
grandparents used that's coming back into vogue.  They've adopted it since
it used to be VW-speak in the days of VW of Germany.

&quot;What is that thing, KG?&quot;

&quot;You're never gonna believe this---it's a viscous coupling!!&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot;

&quot;Way...Dood!&quot;  (laughter)

And there it was, mounted prominently near the optional middle stool/jetski.
KG explains to BA6, &quot;You see, I wired it into the ECU so when I think about
chewing gum, the coupler engages the gum mashing unit so it can deliver
different consistencies of gum relative to my thoughts!&quot;

&quot;Kewl...Dood!&quot;  (more laughter)  KG and BA6 hang out for awhile in the
optional Holigram Privy room mounted on the back of the Africavan.  After
reliving Ben Pon's creation of the first bus, they fire the cold fusion
boosters and head for their camping weekend on the moon.  

&quot;KG, you brought Muir's idiot disk for the backup computer, right?&quot; asks BA6.

&quot;Wouldn't leave earth without it!&quot;
