Subject: Re: [T2] Heat riser tubes

Are you sure he isn't talking about the half moon
packings around the heat risor pipe where it rests
against the cylinder tin and has a small piece of tin
bolted on? If yes, then it will cause no intake or
exhaust leaks. That packing is just insulation for
heat.

 I checked the archives and couldn't find the
 answer to this question. If 
 the asbestos gasket at the base of the one of the
 heat risers is 
 leaking, does this create an intake manifold
 vacuum leak? This is for a stock 71 bus.
 
 it should not. although it will cause an exhaust
 leak.
