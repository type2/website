Subject: [T2] upper bed

Hi all,

     I am looking for part of the upper bed in my 82 westy.  I have the
stationary part.  I need the other mattress &amp; hardware.  I am not even sure
what it looks like.  I am assuming there is some kind of hinge &amp; bracket
assembly.  Let me know what you want for it.  Thanks.
