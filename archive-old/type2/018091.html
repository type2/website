&gt; &gt;or dryer climates, you might not understand, but here in Kansas, it can be
&gt; &gt;100 degrees or more and have 100% humidity!!  Now that's hot.

&gt; Another possibility is to install engine-driven A/C and a large 110V motor
&gt; to drive the compressor while parked (with hookups of course).  The biggest
&gt; problem with this is that you would have to swap belts every time you
&gt; wanted to switch power sources.  I can't think of an easy way to make that
&gt; one work but I'm still thinking it's the best solution since the only
&gt; redundant part is the A/C motor.  I've already bought the motor so it will
&gt; be tried before long.  :)

David and Rick:
David's last idea reminded me of a similar idea I read last year on the
vanagon list (might be able to find it in archives from July or Aug 98
Vanagon list): It was simply to retain the stock ac system and tee in a
hermetic compressor from a window a/c unit. I'm sure there are some hvac
experts out there that could tell you what sizes would work. Since
automotive systems use expansion valves sizing wouldn't have to be as
precise as in a mass produced window air or other domestic product. I'm
not enough of an expert to tell you if you'd need isolation valves to
prevent backflow at pressure, but they sure would be nice for service.
You'd only need to close one on the nonused compressor to stop it
short-circuiting the freon. You'd still have to work out a way to make
the condensor and evaporator fans work for extended periods and with the
ignition off. 
This would seem like a really simple changeover to me: Set up at
campsite, plug in 120v, open engine compartment, close valve on engine
driven compressor, open valve on 120v. compressor, operate controls to
bring 120v. online.
Disadvantage would be: no a/c in non- electric campgrounds, but I guess
that I'd consider carrying a small portable (quiet) generator and a
really long cord. (or just tough it out like everyone else did a
generation ago!)
