Subject: Re: [T2] WT Trade: my Weber DFAV for stock Solex dual carbs

But 75 was fuel injection......there are no 'stock dual carbs, air filter box,
etc' for a 75 USA bus.....

[...]

From: &lt;ToobWiz_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Anyone wanting to replace carbs on their bus? I have a used Weber dual throat
&gt; progressive, with manifolds and air cleaner adaptor. It came off my son's bus
&gt; and was working before the rebuild. It has some wear on the throttle plate
&gt; shafts.
&gt;
&gt; I want a complete stock dual setup, including linkage, air filter box, and
&gt; hoses.
&gt;
&gt; I also have an 009 dizzy that I would trade for a stock dual advance dizzy.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers/Don Carron
