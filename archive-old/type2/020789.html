&gt; assuming the motor or linkage are siezed? Could it be anything else?

Gee, that's not so hard to fix! I've found that before on my 72 Westy. Seems
like mine was making some pretty bad squalling noises to let me know where
the problem was. Too much rain water going down the wiper shafts, maybe
deteriorated plastic seals under the arms. I took one loose at a time and
drizzled WD40 down the shaft till it freed up. THEN: put some real lube in
it. (WD40 or other penetrant is really only just kerosene with fragrance in
it and was very little lubricating ability, great for washing out the iron
oxide bits, but it's not grease.)
I like white grease, especially Lubriplate. It's pretty waterproof and that's
exactly what you need there. If you can wiggle the shaft in and out ( is
there a retaining ring there?) you can work the grease down into the bearing.
If you do one at a time, maybe you can use the wiper motor to work it back
and forth and help it along with pressure on the other wiper arm. Be careful
not to twist off the 10 mm nut. It is possible to remove the whole assembly
from bay window vans and work on it on the bench. Vanagons are a different
ball game. Take out the dash -4 hours on a good day, 6-10 maybe the first
time. (I limped along with one wiper on my 82 Diesel for 2 years till the
heater core started leaking, then it became a lot higher priority.) But we
have a LOT less rain here in the midwest than the Pacific northwest! New
wiper transmissions might be available somewhere and might be a good idea if
you think you'll have the vehicle for the rest of your life! Desert cars
might be good donors for these parts as well.
