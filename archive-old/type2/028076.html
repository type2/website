VDO makes a sensor specifically for the pressure relief valve area (it replaces the slotted screw cap that normally resides there). The regular sump plate sender won't work in the pressure relief valve opening. However, unless you have one of the earlier sump plates sans oil drain plug, you can replace the drain plug with the sending unit you have--no butchering required. Use the gasket that comes with the sender. Save the crush washers in your oil change kit for the needy...or the day your gasket from VDO no longer works.

If your sump plate doesn't have the opening, you can get another sump plate somewhere.

The VDO sensor for the pressure relief valve area cost about the same as the other, but you may have to order it.

Thanks! Joe

&gt;mounting the sensor in the pressure relief is a good idea, or even
