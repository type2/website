Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Engine Cases

&gt;  Does anyone have feelings one way or the other?  have experience?

Hoover says you can use gloss black paint if you thin it with gasoline, which 
will cause it to dry flat.  That didn't work for me.  Use flat black paint.  
I painted the entire case, cylinders, push rod tubes, and auxiliary sump.
I can't tell you that my engine runs cooler because I also added an oil 
cooler and 200 cc's displacement among other changes.  I can tell you that I 
have NO problems with overheating.  And my bus has instrumentation to 
document this.  I'm not just stroking my dip stick and telling you it didn't 
burn my fingers so I'm OK.

&gt;  Other things I am thinking about are:
&gt;  paint the whole exterior of the case to minimize temp differentials;

Yes, including the generator pedestal.

&gt;  paint both the interior and exterior of the sump area;

Exterior only

&gt;  paint the fins on the heads.

I don't think the paint will stick.  It will have to handle at least 400 
degrees F and stick to aluminum.
I got out my dremel tool and removed as much flash as I could.  I also 
removed the flash at the base of the fins with a hack saw blade.  Be sure to 
install the metal plate that blocks off the hole between to two cylinder 
heads 3-4 and 1-2.
And while you have the grinder out unshroud the intake valves, CC the 
combustion chambers, and clean up the ports.

You might want to consider &quot;Cool Tin&quot; also.  I used it, but I don't know if 
it does any good or not.  It takes a bit of time and talent to install.  So 
I'll put it out to the &quot;list&quot; and really confuse the issue ;-)

Have fun and keep us posted;
