Subject: Re: [T2] VPC Air Conditioner for Station Wagon

I'm just hoping that someone out there who used to work VPC or managed to
get a copy of the manuals from the dealers that closed might be willing to
share it with me. In the course of my endless surfing in the internet, I've
come acrossed one or two installation manuals but for the later A/C's. I'll
look for them in my archive and post it for anyone who might be need it. The
reason why Dave Bolen caught my attention was reading through the archive,
it seems that he offered help to Richard Atwell find information on a 78 A/C
he was inquiring about. At least that's what I gathered from the thread. And
now, there's info about it on Mr. Atwell's site. I just want to get the
installation right since it might be waste to experiment on an NOS unit
fresh from the box. Based on one of Mr. Bolen's post, I'll need a template
to make a perfect installation. And that information you don't get everyday
from your regular Type 2 enthusiast.

Back in January 2001, Joseph Clark offered to share the photocopies of the
installation manual of  a DPD A/C unit that he has with the list. Just
trying my luck.

&gt; Dave Bolen has posted to the list as recently as 5/5/2005 and can probably
&gt; answer any general questions you have about the history of VPC units, you
&gt; might have to look elsewhere for detailed info though... as far as I know
&gt; all the A/C units were after market designs for the US market and
installed
&gt; here in the US either at the entry port or by dealers...
