&gt; Oil pickup is like the 2.0L Vanagon but straignt up, oil refill is on

Sounds like a 914.

&gt; but my main problem is: plugs
&gt; don't have the same angle as the standard pancake engine!!!!!! so if i
&gt; order 2 new head, plug hole will have to be relocated! It also has a
&gt; &quot;&quot;Moto?????&quot;&quot; single carb?

Sounds like 914 2.0L head. Very expensive.

&gt; Porsche engine??? i didn't push my reserch yesterday, as to bore &amp; stoke
&gt; but it seam to me that it's a 1800cc...
&gt; of course, both head have dead EX valve seat , guide, valves
&gt; 
&gt; I think that engine code is AG

GA probably.
 
&gt; Anyway, can you point me out to a web-site so i can lookout head serial #
