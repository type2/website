Yeah, at Papago Park just under &quot;Bonger's Hole&quot; in the rock. You must be
familiar with the Phoenix area. By the way, how in the hell could they get
Feeenix spelt rite and mezz up the month? They just &quot;assume&quot; that I work
while at Boeing &lt;McD Douglas&gt; Helicopter... Crap, I try to only put in my
time and sneak home.
