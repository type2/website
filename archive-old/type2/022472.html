&gt;Porsche 914's came with rev-limiting rotors in them.  I bounce mine all the 
&gt;time in my 914 in 1st and 2nd and occasionally in 3rd - my bus doesn't seem to 
&gt;need one :(.  Cuts out at 5500 RPM.  Will work on all type IV powered buses.  
&gt;Part number 022-905-225A - available at www.pelicanparts_dot_com for $20.60.

The 914 one limits at 5850rpm, I have one in my 1776, I can hit it in every gear 
except 4. If the Pelican Parts one limits to 5500, it is not an exact replacement 
for this Porsche/VW partnumber. It will fit all T1 and T4 engines with the 
regular later style distributor cap. It is a good idea to have one if your engine 
is of the mild performance variety. For the racing girlfriend it may not be the 
solution as 5850rpm is already 'overrevving' in most cases, some buses
got 4500rpm rotors, some 5400. I've found both of these in T1 engines. 
If you have one laying around, look on the underside to see its cut off point, 
it's stamped into it. 

The 'best' Bosch distributor cap you can buy ends with 193, it is clearcoated 
both on the inside and the outside.

The 'best' Bosch points I found are the ones ending in 145, these are Mercedes 
6 cylinder points that will fit all applications that use the same points as in 
a 009, they're solid tungsten, as usual, but also nickel plated to prevent 
corrosion. The lifter is made of something that Bosch calls Polyimid which, 
they (Bosch) say, is more wear resistant than the standard Resitex material 
Bosch uses. The spring is a little heavier than a 4 cylinder one, (a Mercedes 
6 Auto trans with VW points won't even rev up enough to shift...) and is usefull 
in high(er) performance applications because they can be ran at higher RPMs 
without 'point float'.

If the girlfriend would be hitting the rev limiter all the time..  I'm not sure if 
it would be healthier for the engine than how she currently drives, when the 
limiter comes in the engine seems to wanna jump out of the engine compartment... 

An Autometer shiftlight www.autometer_dot_com might just be the solution, 
strategically placed, and with exchangable so-called &quot;pills&quot;, so you can 
set it at the desired limit, it won't limit RPMs, but will alert your girlfriend 
to shift or slow down, without limiting yourself..

Hope it helps,

Brian
