Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Engine Wiring Harness Wanted 

Calif or Federal version?  It makes a BIG difference. [a quick way to tell:
Cal version has electronic ignition]


&gt;I'm in the process of putting my engine back together for &quot;Blue Eyes&quot; and
have decided that the wiring harness in the engine compartment is so burnt and
has suffered through so many mouse attacks that it would be easier to get a
replacement than fix this one.  Does anyone have one for sale?  My Westy is an
82 model.
