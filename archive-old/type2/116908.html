Subject: Re: Re:plywood floor in westy

Do you remember the dimensions of the floor by chance? The old floor piece
which I kept for a pattern is like 51&quot; and something by 50&quot; and something.
Originally a german 5x5 sheet or whatever that would be in metric. Did you
use 4x8 sheets? How where you able to cover the gaps that would be on the
sides where the plywood only covers 4 feet across on the floor?? Thanks for
the info...

&gt; Dave,
&gt;     I redid the floor in our 71 a couple of years ago.  The following
&gt; combination gave just the right height so there was no space between
&gt; the bottom edge of the furniture and the top of the floor.
&gt;     1.  One layer of 11/32 inch plywood
&gt;     2.  One layer of 1/8 inch masonite
&gt;     3.  Comercial grade tiles (about an 1/8 inch thick) glued down
&gt; Of course the first step was to clean, repair and paint the metal
&gt; floor.  If you need more info just ask.
