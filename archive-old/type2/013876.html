Subject: RE: Fuel Injection Fuel Tank


&gt;I plan to install a complete 1978 L-Jetronic fuel injection system 
&gt;into my 74 loaf. &lt;snip&gt;

Your best route would be to obtain an FI fuel tank.  It's not that much trouble 
to clean one and get it ready for use and you'll likely be happier with it in 
the long run.  They pretty easy to obtain for not much money.

&gt;#1 Could I possibly run the fuel return line to one of the top vent 
&gt;ports on my tank? 

The only problem I can see with this approach is all the turbulance you would 
be causing inside the tank.  Stirring up sediment and making bubbles.  I'd also 
be concerned about plugging up one of the vents.  Why did VW put 2 in there in 
the first place?

&gt;#2 Would it be possible to add a T-fitting to the standard fuel port
&gt;on the bottom of the tank?

Although I've heard of this being done, I really don't think it's a good idea.  
Beside the fact that you may be messing around with the pressures that your 
fuel pump should be dealing with (as mentioned by another listee), you're 
creating a likely vapor-lock problem.  With FI, the fuel is pumped through the 
(hot) engine compartment and the unused fuel is returned.  When it goes back 
into the tank, it mixes with the much cooler fuel that is floating around in 
there before being pumped back through again.  With the &quot;T&quot; solution, you'd be 
pumping hot fuel back through and heating it even more.  Sounds like a great 
way to create vapor lock to me.
