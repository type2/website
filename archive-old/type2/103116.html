Subject: Re: [T2] VW Trends follies

And that sort of journalism is the reason I quit reading the VW magazines 
long, long ago.

It took a while but I finally realized that the magazine was written as 
support for their advertising departments.

I wonder if the same could be true of the mainstream car mags like Cart and 
Driver and Road &amp; Track. Those aren't very interesting anymore either.

&gt;The real kicker is that the latest issue has the following blurb on the
&gt;cover &quot;Why in Synthetic oil overlooked?&quot;. The article inside extolls the
&gt;virtues of synth oil and attempts to dispel some of the myths.
&gt;This means that a) no one person reads all the content for each month's 
&gt;issues
&gt;and one hand knows not what the other does, b)VWT's tech editor knows not 
&gt;what
&gt;the he** he speaks of, C)they really do believe that synth oil is bad, and 
&gt;they
&gt;want readers to ruin their engines and buy new ones from their advertisers.
&gt;Just some food for thought on friday, feel free to pick apart their reasoning
&gt;(or mine if necesary).
