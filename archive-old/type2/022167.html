&gt;Hello list,
&gt;
&gt;In planning a summer road trip from Austin, TX to Tempe, AZ, I solicit
&gt;advice from the list.  I have a perfectly running recently rebuilt 1600
&gt;upright dual port with a new oil cooler, 34pict carb and 009 dist 
&gt;pushing a 79 Westy without a temperature gauge.  My concerns are with
keeping it 
&gt;cool, should I stick to 55mph or am I paranoid and should go 70mph? 
================================&gt;
We didn't make it to Europe this year, so our trip will be up Oregon and
Washington during the first week of July.
The rough part, as I see it, like you, will be the trek across Texas, NM,
and AZ to San Francisco to meet Mary Beth at the airport, where we will
begin the fun part of the trip.

As for going across the hot states during the high temperature calender
time, I plan on staying very close to moderate speeds, and sleeping during
the heat of the day. Early morning and late evening engine runs with
20W-50 oil kept clean as honey is my hope for battling high temperatures.
Hills are to be taken at a gentle speed, and downslopes are to be taken at
moderate speeds, as well.

The 1600 SP runs very nice, and I am hoping that I can remain of the frame
of mind that is proper, as opposed to becoming impatient as everyone
passes me by. 

I am gonna try and keep thinking about what my engine might like with each
new mile, all the while remembering that those 4 pistons will ultimately
make the decision as to whether it is a fun trip, or a bad trip.

Casper der Friendly Bus will be the boss. I will simply lead at the pace
he desires during the time he desires.

Bob in Houston
