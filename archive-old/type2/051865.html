[...] Too bad!  The removable rear valence is handy.

&gt;&gt; [...]After removing the bumper, remove the rear valence body panel.
&gt;&gt; Then you have a clear path to pull the engine straight out the back, no
&gt;&gt; need to jack the bus up at all.  It's way easier than a beetle.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This only works on a 68 to 71 bay.
&gt; 72 and up has a non-removable valance. [but with a Victor wrench, anything
&gt; is removable]
