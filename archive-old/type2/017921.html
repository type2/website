Subject: buses that begged to be searched and other neat stuff

haha! i am laughing at all the responses i get! i have not had one &quot;bad&quot;
response...every one has been upful, funny, positive or something else
that makes me smile! it is nice to see some positive vibes going on here
and not the harping i've seen lately.

and no i dont use the cubby holes in my bus for anything illegal. i am
well aware of things like dogs, search laws, the ramifications of 420
bumper stickers, etc.  i actually take really good care of my bus and
would say its probably the best maintained one in my city (out of maybe
5 buses). what that has anything to do with anything i really dont know!
haha.

i hope everyone has a nice weekend and i hope people go on some nice
trips (driving trips) for the weekend and let us all know of anything
fun that went on... i am going on campout next weekend i think with my
bus and a '63 crewcab. should be a blast (no not the bus either).

one love, rasdave :)
