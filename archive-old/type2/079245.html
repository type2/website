Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Aux Battery systems was  Charging Spare-Beckett's
    tome re Hella kit and wiring size

So are there any other Electrical Engineers out there in List land?  I'd like to hear from a few on this whole dual battery issue.  With that said, if you get more than 1 EE involved in a technical discussion, there WILL be disagreements. 

I've actually done a lot of work with batteries for automotive use.  I spent a couple years consulting with GM on their Saturn electric car program in Southern Cal, so I probably know a bit about automotive electrical systems that the general VW public may not know.  I'd be willing to join in a discussion about dual batteries, but I don't want to get involved in any ego-based arguments concerning electrical theory.  It would be nice if all the EE's on the list could come up with a consensus opinion that we all could benefit from.

There are a lot of misconceptions, old wive's tales, tall stories, etc. on electricity in general.  It would be nice to clear things up a bit.

&gt;     Now for my question. I have a 78' Westy with the 12/120volt fridge and
&gt;I am getting ready to hook back up the aux battery. A PO removed the
&gt;battery and simple snipped the wires. They are all there including the
&gt;original relay, the ends have just been cut. I would first off like to know
&gt;how much juice that fridge draws when it cycles and when it is not cycling?
&gt;I want to know how big of a battery I should get to install. I dont want to
&gt;put a huge AGM back there as I have enough weight in the rear as it is.
&gt;Also with the factory relay would that not limit my charging rate to say
&gt;15amps? 

&gt;     I don't want to over tax my alternator either but is there not a way I
&gt;could at least up that charge rate to say 30 amps and still not hurt my
&gt;alternator? I like to camp for days at a time and would love to be able to
&gt;run my fridge and not have to run my engine for 12-13 hours every other day
&gt;to keep up wiht the demand. Any ideas?
