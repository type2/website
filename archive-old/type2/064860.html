&gt; Ya know - after a very positive reply to my query
&gt; letter - I sent Hot VWs an article and a photo
&gt; submission about the resto-customization of
&gt; my '68 Bus - and after SIX months they
&gt; returned it to me UNPUBLISHED! I think there
&gt; were two things working against me:
&gt; etc....
So let me get this straight-you actually WANTED to appear in this trashy
rag?  I must admit, though, it was a pretty good idea to write the article
yourself.  Their writers couldn't write themselves out of a wet paper bag.
For the record I prefer VolksWorld when I can get it.
