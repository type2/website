Subject: Re: j-tubes or heat exchangers?

J-tubes do take the place of heat exchangers, eliminating the
heat-transfer boxes and therefore your heat.

I'd recommend that you take another look at the old boxes.  Original boxes
are the best and are very difficult to find.  I've found that the boxes
are easily patched by brazing patches over the holes and reinforcing where
the exhaust pipe enters/exits with a metal sleeve.

The condition of the heater boxes has little bearing on engine overheating
except that leaky boxes can divert a bit more air from the fan.

For heaven's sake, don't throw the old boxes away, even if you don't use
them.  Someone will find them useful down the road!

&gt; Hello all...
&gt;   Quick question. Do J-tubes take the place of heat exchangers? If so, what is the advantage/disadvantage? I'm assuming the decision will drasticly affect the heating and/or cooling system of the bus.

&gt;   I bought my bus w/out an engine, so I'll need an exhaust system. I did get the original  heat exchangers from the PO, but they don't look too hot. I would rather by new ones than take a chance on the old ones leaking and possibly killing a freshly installed engine!
