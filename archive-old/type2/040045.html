There are busses for all kinds of people and there are people for all kind
of busses.  There was a guy at the RMMW show last year that his whole bus
was just a beautiful patina of rust.  I always thought that my idea to be
different would be to take a bus and then get it perfect and then make it
look like rust and cancer with the custom paint job?
Just tell people that is what you did!!  ;^{)
Any way back to the people and their busses.  Some busses look like Calvin
Klein type people and some busses look like overall wearing people.
Your bus is wearing overalls and is still beautiful to the people that look
past the overalls!!!
I have seen your bus and in my eyes it is beautiful and every mark on it
means something to somebody!!  Just like people!
