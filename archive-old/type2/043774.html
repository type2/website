Subject: Re: [T2] Replacing High Top

&gt; &gt;I plan on using Butyl (??) tape between the top and the roof on the other
&gt; &gt;three sides of the bus.  This tape is a clay like material in a roll with
&gt; &gt;an adhesive side.  Is that what most people used?  Seems to me that is
&gt; &gt;what was used on the original roof.
&gt; 
&gt; All I can say is that Butyl (??) is awesome stuff.  Just got done using it
&gt; in the replacement of my rear quarter windows in the Mustang. 

Interestingly, I was just watching a show where it was stated that the
fiberglass roof on a van was &quot;attached with sealant.&quot; So I think you're
on to something here. 

I've long been pondering what I'd use on my bus in this situation and
hoped I might be able to find some sort of long coiled length of generic
rubber gasket material from an RV place to cut to fit and force around
the curves. But this Butyl stuff sounds pretty cool. I'm assuming it's
satisfactorily waterproof if you're using it on windows.
