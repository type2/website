I should've stated before I posted that I am planning on travelling cross 
country and living in my bus is that this bus hasn't been on the road for 
about 2 years now. I have been busy fixing anything and everything that I can 
afford ( that's why it's taken 2 years ). I don't want this trip to seem like 
an impulse idea, I've been working hard to be my bus finished so it will be 
reliable :) Thank you to everyone who has given me advice regarding this 
trip. You all are wonderful :)
