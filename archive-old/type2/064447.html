Subject: Help needed installing heads 

I hurt my wrist on the last CCC camping trip... well, on the way to it. I
feel crippled, I can't twist my wrist or put much pressure on it.  So, I was
wondering if any one in the Bayarea would like to make a little extra money
by installing my heads for me in my '77 bus.  I have a driveway, garage, and
tools here.  Or I can drive it somewhere if needed.

Thanks,  Bradley
