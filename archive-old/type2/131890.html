Subject: Good 76 CA bus for sale Charleston SC

Volks,

I have been daily driving this bus for a few weeks, and it is sweet, but i
gotta sell to have money to work on things on my old WV farm.  Of course
more money in it than i want, but whoever buys this can literally hop in and
drive across the country.  No joke.

New motor, brakes (all..drums, rotors hoses, etc) clutch, AFM, heat works,
very little rust (it was a California bus) and new cv boots.

Front seats have been upholstered and rear is fine...no middle seat.  Paint
is OK, and may be original..............dingy, but i have begun rubbing
compund on it and it is really starting to shine.  Tires are OK but nothing
spectacular(not dryrotted or anything, just worn) New windshield, too.
Sliding door works fine, too.  It is watertight...ie does not leak anywhere
in the rain.

$3500 and must pic up in Charleston, SC................
