Hi all,

Since this is friday i thought i might chime in about the legalities of
traveling with firearms (what some have proposed as a solution to roadside
violence.)

I think from a personal protection standpoint it could be a good idea, but
with busses being cop-magnets, a roadside search could be disastrous for
some of you &quot;packin heat&quot; types... if you dont know the law.

Maybe read this link if you travel with firearms...

I have weighed the pros and cons and at this point the threat of running
afoul of our wonderful and always fair police force outweighs the benefits
of traveling with a firearm, for me anyway.

take care,

P.S. the term &quot;riding shotgun&quot; came from the stagecoach days when the
passenger next to the driver rode conspicuously armed to defend against
&amp; visually deter criminals. Truly riding shotgun today would get you
thrown in jail in a heartbeat...
