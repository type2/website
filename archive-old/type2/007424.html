Odd.  I've never had a problem with United Foreign Auto.  Took a
&quot;tight&quot; CV (it had overheated and blown the boot within 30 miles of
installation) back to them and they had no problem exchanging it.  The
owner (who has an authentic-sounding German accent) is a bit gruff,
but he's always treated me well.

If you think that your 009 is defective, take it to an ignition shop
and have them put it on a distributor machine.  They can tell
immediately if something is amiss.  If it's bad, take it back armed
with the information provided by the ignition shop.
