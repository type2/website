&gt;It seems the natural instinct to pour with the spout down, 
***
one could just open their eyes and see the picture illustrating the correct
way on the side of the bottle.

&gt;90 degrees bafore it starts to pour, meaning you can lower the can spout
&gt;very close to the 
&gt;target before it starts to pour, drastically increasing your first strike
&gt;accuracy.
***
yes, but with a stock oil air-cleaner the intake pipe sticks out so that
you cannot really get a good look at the filler hole and still hold the
quart of oil in your right hand while pouring.
you can stick your head into the engine compartment next to the carb while
holding the quart so the bottom of it is pointing out the rear... but that
still doesn't give you too much of a view seeing as the generator is there
and all..

get a little stubby funnel...
or pull out the air cleaner.. [two screws...to clips...pop.pop.pop you're
clear]

&gt;Enyways. Mr. Rowe my grade six shop teacher said tjis is the &quot;right way to
&gt;pour&quot;,
&gt;and it sure cuts down on the rags bill.
