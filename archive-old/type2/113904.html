Subject: RE: [T2] Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

I just received an order from Bus Depot.  Aside from a marginal packing job, everything was great.  All parts accounted for, shipped promptly and of course the price was right.

But I have learned how to be a satisfied Bus Depot customer - you have to play their game.  Here are a few simple rules which, if followed practically guarantee that you will be satisfied with your Bus Depot order:

1.  Know what you are ordering (Don't ask questions).
2.  Order at least two weeks in advance of when you need the parts (and be prepared to wait two weeks to receive the parts).
2a.  Corollary: Do not order critical parts.  In other words, if a part were to go on back order for a few months and this would cause you major problems, get it from somewhere else instead.

That's it - follow those rules and you will always be satisfied.

-David
