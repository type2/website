&gt;Now, here's where I need to be educated :-)  At a given (arbitrary)

&gt;why does retarded timing lower vacuum in the plenum?

No, timing and rpm are related. If you advance the timing you'll find that the engine speeds up. Retard the timing, the engine slows a little and it pulls less vacuum: the piston is moving slower and has more time to draw into the attempted volume of air.

&gt;Isn't the plenum 
&gt;vacuum basically the difference between what the engine wants to suck 
&gt;through vs. what the throttle body is willing to let through? 

Yes. Vacuum means partial vacuum really and it's the difference between what the piston sucked in and what it tried to suck in restricted by the intake manifold.
