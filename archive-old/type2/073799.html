Subject: RE: [T2] lessons on the aftermarket

Hey let's take it easy bashing the number one manufacturer and importer of
quality restoration products. First WCM West Coast Metrics offers a lifetime
guarantee for there product to last a lifetime and to fit perfectly. So how
can you complain about the LAME fit. Just send it back for a new one. The
problem is not that you bought a WCM product. You bought an auction site
product. WCM parts cost more because they are a quality guaranteed product.
Not all OEM German product runs are perfect either. poop happens. Don't take
a chance, buy a product with a guarantee. Call WCM and tell them what
happened. I'm willing to bet that they will help you out. If not I'll go bat
for you. WCM products are the best available period. I'll at least give you
nine bucks trade in for it.

Subject: [T2] lessons on the aftermarket


its a bit of work replacing a window scraper. not rocket science, but the
window area has to get yanked, and its an hours operation. i collect window
scrapers at junkyards. i need 'em; my friends need 'em. unfortunately
there's a recent shortage of prime passenger side scrapers off low mileage
buses so i caved in and used a wcm scraper to replace a less than adaquate
scraper i picked last week. the one i picked last week sat on my bus for
one day, and i said nahh. months ago i bought the wcm scraper on that
online auction thing for nine bucks. big deal. never really hoped i'd have
use it - experimental as it were.

so i pulled a less than adequate junkyard scraper to try a wcm product for
the first time. i figured new could be better, and was i sorry. the
aluminum is okay, but the rubber is so sorrowful. on the driver's side
scraper, my replacement picked from a 60k mile bus still snaps against the
glass. the wcm rubber is LAME. makes me glad i didn't buy it retail, and
moreover, i hear their prices shot up a lot this year. moral: junkyards.
i'd even re-rivet good rubber canabalized from a bent metal scraper to put
onto a good metal scraper hanger.

fun fact: the less than adequate scraper i picked last week was found to be
a wcm product. live and learn.  AND, the replacement door seals on the same
bus in the junkyard were newish, and a thrashed. hard to tell where they
came from. what a mess.      - steve
