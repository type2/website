Volks,

No, it is not as off-topic as it sounds :-)  One of the major threats to
heat in our beloved vehicles is deterioration of the main heater channel.
I recently had a &lt;euphemism&gt;bear&lt;/euphemism&gt; of a time getting my bus past
inspection because they demanded at least air, if not warmth, to the
defrost vents.  My solution was to go down to home despot and buy a heater
duct.  Now because of our antiquated system of measurements, heater ducts
in this country (the US :)  come in 3 1/2&quot;, 4&quot;, etc. sizes.  None of which
are a good match for the bus.  In addition, in my case the heat
distribution box at the front was totaly rusted off, so the opening at the
front was substantially larger than the one at the back.

At home despot (and pretty nearly everywhere else, no doubt), they sell a
variety of duct that comes open.  I bought a 5' length of this duct, a
pair of sheet metal vice-grips and I already owned a good pair of snips.  
Doing the 2piR thang, I figured the circumferencce of the two ends, cut
the tube down, bent a new edge onto it, and cut it to length.  It worked
very well.  It does need insulation to be an effective heat carrier, but
it is *WAY* better than nothing!

Now, for me, at home in my spare time, the job of bending the new edge
onto the cut down pipe was &lt;euphemism&gt;quite difficult&lt;/euphemism&gt;.  I
imagine that the owner of a decent 4' sheet metal brake could turn these
pups out in no time flat.  Thus my question...  do we have any HVAC or
sheet metal people on the list?  If you are one, and would consider
turning out a couple of dozen tubes, I would be happy to give you
dimensions!!!  I think that selling them would be *no* problem!

As a mini-tutorial on what I did, here are some pictures:  (if you have a
mailer that will go to them, fine, otherwise, cut  and paste them into a
browser)

First, the three tubes.  the right hand tube is the rusty tiube from my
'67, the left hand tube is the raw tube as bought from home despot, the
middle tube is the cut down tube.&lt;/a&gt;

Second, the edge on the tube as bought from home despot.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/misc/myedge.jpg&quot;&gt;
Third, the edge I made at home.&lt;/a&gt;  The tools for this job were a
straight-edge to mark the cuts and bends, a utility knife to mark them
with (I could not find a pen that would mark on galvanized metal), a
tin-snips to cut with (offset handle are by *far* the way to go!), and a
pair of vice-grips.

The vice grips pliers you need for this job will also help in rounding out
your tool box, as they are the *oddest* looking set I have seen yet... &lt;a
href=&quot;http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/misc/vicegrip.jpg&quot;&gt;vice grip 8R's
&lt;/a&gt;... the poor man's sheet metal brake!

And lastly a word of warning... having a tendon reattached is *very*
painful!  sheet metal is sharper than it looks and if it slides in your
hand, major damage can result!!! Be careful!!!  Wear leather-palmed
gloves, if you have them!
