Subject: [T2] more fog light info as requested

as i have received numerous emails asking for more info here it is.
I made 2 errors in my first post the lights are 5 inches in diameter and
are made by JF manufacturing . they are on page 2 of the auxiliary
lighting page on carparts_dot_com and available as both driving and fog
lights.   also sorry for those who already ordered, if you go to
www.coolsavings_dot_com they have a free shipping from carparts_dot_com coupon,
i used this, also a discount coupon i think 15% you may need to register
at cool savings but its free and will get you access to lots of online
coupons and rebates
the lights look identical to those pictured in sales literature i have
as the original accessory fog lights from vw.  I was very pleasantly
surprised by the quality for a 16 dollar light and also at how closely
they resemble the original style lights.  carparts_dot_com has terrible
customer service and they cannot give more info than is on the site i
had to call the manufacturer for dimensions beyond the diameter.
Glad to have been helpful and i hope this clears up any confusion, sorry
for the errors in my first post.
