Subject: Re: [T2] help with FI idle mixture

Steve:  Several years ago, I invested several hundred dollars in a Gene
Berg exhaust gas analyzer. It worked well but I have used it only once.

Here is the problem. It gets its signal from an oxygen sensor that must be
installed so it's probe sticks in the exhaust manifold.  At the time, I had
an extractor exhaust system that came from the PO on my '71 Westy. It was
relatively easy to punch a hole in the extractor, weld in the custom tang,
and thereby mount the sensor.

Since that time, I've converted the bus to a stock exhaust (the neighbors
voted and indicated that they favored this return to stock) and I have
stock exhausts on my Ghia and bug. I have found no way of mounting the
sensor on a stock system.

So......... Can you tell me how the sensor mounts in the JCW system? A
probe that gets inserted into the tail pipe like those in the VA emissions
inspections?

Thanks, Jack

Would you believe JC Whitney?  not exactly inexpensive, but mine works OK...

I had a stumble at all RPMs in my 78 FI 2.0L all stock. Put it on  a smog
sniffer and found the CO at 3.5 (at idle). Adjusted to 1.7. Per Bentley I
am near spot on at 1.7. Runs better now.

Anyone have experience with this adjustment? Any thoughts, other than
Bentley,  on where this adjustment should be?

Thanks! Regards,
Chris
