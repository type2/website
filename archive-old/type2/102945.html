Subject: Re: [T2] Long Mirror

Don't forget what you see out the mirror also depends on how tall/short you
are and if the seat high is different to standard.
I have heard the Vanagon mirror will fit the bay's also and are quite a bit
bigger.

As for the rear height, definitely adjust them properly (with the torsion
bars). The proper ride height will also affect CV life, and as the number of
&quot;Baja Bus's&quot; here in Brisbane have proven the shock mounts cannot handle the
strain of coil overs or air springs/shocks.
