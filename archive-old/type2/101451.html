Subject: [T2] external oil cooler


&gt; I am looking to install an external oil cooler on my 82 Westfalia.  Any 
&gt; advice as to product selection or installation methods?

Oil filter andwich plate adapter, finned plate-style cooler,
SS braided hoses with flared tubing -AN fittings,
inline thermostat, optional sensor / switch remote
cooler fan and relay, all for less than $1000.
Hose barb installations require diligent inspection.
Check that cheapo hose clamp pressure rating !
( Here in the northeast,we preheat the oil overnight:)
Still interested ?
