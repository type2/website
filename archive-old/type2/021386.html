&gt;My 1975 bus used to have ac, but the P.O. removed the compressor and

&gt;out to make room for the compressor. If anyone is parting out a bay
&gt;window bus that never had ac and is willing to cut a piece out of the
&gt;engine compartment for me, please let me know.

I removed the AC from my '73 many years ago.  I had to replace the
left rear tin piece.  To close the hole that was hacked by the VW
dealer's AC installer for the compressor, I had a local metal
fabricator/welder replace the missing body metal.  Furthermore, there
were holes cut into the left rear wheel well and in the cockpit floor
to pass the refrigerant hoses through.  I had the wheel well hole
welded shut too.  This has kept dirt from entering the engine room.
Good luck,
