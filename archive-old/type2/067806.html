Subject: Similarities: VW &amp; Ford, what?, huh?

Just some musing this morning from my commute.  I've been driving my 
'64 Ford Crewcab these past couple of days.  (I'm having a hard time 
getting motivated to keep working on my '80's CV's when it's 40 degrees 
outside, of course I have no garage)

Anyway, I noticed some similarities to my past '64 Deluxe.  It took 
forever for it to get the cab warmed up.  The sloppy steering was all 
too familiar.  Vertical windshield, but was missing the center divider.  
The steering wheel is upright.  One can rest one's arm ON the 
door when the window is open, not UP on it like newer cars.  It 
doesn't like to go fast, so the old drive slow reflexes took over.
Since I learned to drive on this truck, I guess I the change to a VW 
wasn't THAT big of transition.

Happy Driving -
