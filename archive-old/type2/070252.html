Subject: Looking for Gas Heater Parts

&gt;
&gt;I am on the verge of installing a gas heater in my 82 Vanagon and am on the
&gt;lookout for two parts:
&gt;
&gt;a) the junction box that fits to the gas heater and takes incoming air from
&gt;both the stock heater boxes and the interior of the van. According to the
&gt;Bentley manual this junction box replaces the stock one and allows air to be
&gt;recirculated for faster warm ups;
&gt;
&gt;b) the squirrel cage fan that sits alongside the junction box. This is a 12
&gt;volt fan that supplements the fan residing in the engine compartment
&gt;attached to the alternator. 
&gt;
&gt;If you have these items for sale or know of a place where I can locate them,
&gt;please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks - David C.
