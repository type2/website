Subject: Re: [T2] when clutch is in i hear noise, until its released
  ..what  gives?

the little round thing yes LOL i think what you are asking is if the little round thing up in the tranny around the splines there yes it is a throw out bearing...
very easy to pop off ...
and very easy to replace..
as far as sound then....
hmmmm what kind of sound is it...
makeing?
wineing? or the trhow out bearing sound...?

really not that hard at all to change the clutch disc or poressure plate or throw out bearing..
all in a days job.. and can have the engine back in .. depends if you have a couple of needed tools though...
peace and good luck..

I've never replace a clutch in a VW, as a matter of
fact when i pulled my engine from my bus, that was my
first for VW as well..

I have replaced other clutchs, throw out bearings, etc
on other cars.. and im assuming this noise im hearing
is probably the throwout bearing.. is this the round
little lever that is attached to the tranny?

or is this noise im hearing when the cluch is pushed
in the pressure plate? 

The noise isnt to bad, but noticable to me.. How long
would one guess i have before i have to replace it.??

thanx,
