Subject: extremely weird low miles Bus sighting

This is a good one!

A local VW junkyard is storing an electric 79 Bus for somebody.

It is originally from the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority), who own all
the good real estate around here and sell everybody their electricity.
It has a couple of &quot;electric vehicle &quot; logos on it.

THis car has the seemingly standard 4 speed tranny, but no shifter at
all. Revers is engaged via a switch on the dash board.

Instead of a clutch pedal its got the stock automatic bus rubber plug in
the floor board.
THe frame is reinforced with additional steel beams welded to the stock
beams.

Now for the wierd part: the car is in every detail a US model and is
very original with ~30tmls on it, BUT there is no hole for the ECU and
it never had the mounting bracket for the air filter.
So it is a US model, but with the &quot;rest of the world&quot; carburator engine
compartment.

Inside the car is a big electronics box made by Siemens. It says
&quot;development version D&quot; on the inside (in german).

With VW you never stop wondering.
