Subject: Re: Advice Sought -Engine Rebuild.

Okay this might not be advice but another question.  I'm not a 
particularly adept mechanic.  But we had on a Chrysler a compression test 
that showed one cylinder with a really bad compression while all the 
others where fine.  Started make preparations for a new engine and 
continued to run the car.  It was fine.  The compression problem healed 
itself.  Another mechanic checking the car explained that what probably 
happened was a fluke lining up of the rings so the splits were synched.  
This prevented the cylinder from having good compression but with more 
use the rings slipped back out of alignment and compression was fine.

Can the same thing happen with this kind of engine?

&gt; Well folks: this is the moment I thought would never happen.
&gt; 
&gt; After only 20,000 miles the GEX 2.0 litre rebuild has begun to pack it in.
&gt; No.3 is showing 60psi; and the rest all have around 110psi. Precautions
&gt; taken include: changing the oil regularly every 3000 miles, a head temp
&gt; gauge; an oil pressure gauge and oil temp gauge;  a second oil cooler and
&gt; synthetic oil beginning at 12K. The engine was at about 145psi all around at
&gt; 5 k but has been deteriorating since this spring.
&gt; 
&gt; Funny thing,  acceleration seems fine -read normal; cruising speed is 75+
&gt; and the cruising around town is per usual. Gas consumption has increased
&gt; considerably and idle is almost impossible to set properly.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are my three choices:
&gt; 
&gt; Continue to drive it until the engine collapses -somwehere in Northern
&gt; Newfoundland;
&gt; 
&gt; Park it and wait until the winter to work on it myself - nicest option but
&gt; no time in the day these days;
&gt; 
&gt; Pay someone to do the work.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 3 it is and therefore I am looking for some basic advice from all of you:
&gt; 
&gt; Should I go with a left side head replacement only?
&gt; 
&gt; Engine replacement?
&gt; 
&gt; Rebuild?
&gt; 
&gt; At the minumum it will probably be around 900.00 CDN for this job (assuming
&gt; a cylinder head  at 400.00 and 9-10 hours labour).
&gt; 
&gt; In retrospect the 1000.00 not spent on buying  a VW factory rebuild at
&gt; installation two years ago  was clearly a false savings.
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to go after GEX to help cover some of the expenses here. I am
&gt; thinking poor quality workmanship is likely. It is possible that the valves
&gt; are not seating properly due to  the seats having worked their way out but
&gt; at 20k?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any advice.
