&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I found this thread really interesting with regards to the cooling aspect.
&gt;Can anyone out there compare the turbo setup (cooling and powerwise) to the
&gt;old judson supercharger installation for the 36 and 40 HP motors? 

Wow, how old are you?  Judson!  I played with  Judsons on an MG and a
Porsche in the '60s, and gave up.  As Smokey Yunnick said, &quot;The man who
wants a blower is the man who's never had one.&quot;
