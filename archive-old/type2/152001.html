air flow!

&gt; How is rain water supposed to drain after it enters the rear engine vents
&gt; (the ones right behind the back side windows)?  On my 79 bus, it appears to
&gt; me that it just drains down to the battery shelf.  Is this correct?  I mean,
&gt; rain water and battery acid... what a combination for making rust.  I had
&gt; planned to put acid reducing mats under my batteries (I have a camper with
&gt; dual batteries), but now I'm thinking this might be a bad idea if rain water
&gt; will collect down there... the mat will probably hold the water and make the
&gt; problem even worse.  So, am I correct in my observation that the water just
&gt; goes down to the battery shelf or am I missing something - or, for that
&gt; matter, is my bus missing something?

when the engine is running it is sucking huge quantities of air into the
cooling system, in the rain it also is sucking the rain thru the engine,
it helps cool.   and when you shut off usually the engine heat evaporates
what water remains
