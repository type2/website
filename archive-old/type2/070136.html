For all of you on the hunt for that Drive Away tent there was a guy at the
Bug-Out that had one. He said the poles were at home.  Yeah Right, but
maybe he does.  I got his card so give him a call and get the facts.  He
said there was a small rip in one place, I have a couple VW canvas
patches for a tent so I might help someone patch theirs up.  Good look
bargaining, he quoted $350 on Saturday
