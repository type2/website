Bosch or Ford they both do the exact same thing. The point that I am making
is that the 50 wire from the ignition switch is not turning the starter
motor. It is simply pulling the solinoid and holding it. The power for the
starter motor feeds off the 30 terminal once the solinoid is pulled. Hence
its dual action (solinoid and relay). The only advantage the relay has is in
aiding the pull and hold current to the solinoid, not the starter motor.
Shot starter motors is 9 out of 10 reasons why people waste there time and
money on these things.

In fact they do more harm then good, adding more potential wiring problems,
loose connections, shorts, ect.

I will repeat my statment: The current that drives the starter motor does
not go throught the ignition switch. Only the pull and hold current for the
solinoid.
