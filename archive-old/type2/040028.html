&gt; So you are saying that if you hit a hole where the wheel drops suddenly,
&gt; THEN you couold separate a loose ball joint?  Are there any beforehand
&gt; clues, like rattling on slight washborded roads?

I suppose you could, but it would have to be a _very_ abrupt drop, such as
going off of a tall curb.

Before you get to this point, the front end will feel quite loose and your
tires will probably wear funny.
