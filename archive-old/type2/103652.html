Subject: [T2] Camper headliner


&gt; I've been looking for a replacement camper headliner for a long time:
nothing at the junkyards and what I have has shrunk from the heat and peeled
and is no good. This the vinyl above the cab, the sides and on the bottom on
the top bunk.
&gt;
&gt; GoWesty seems to have started selling a kit.  Does anyone know anything
about it?

I just installed this kit in my 78 about two months ago. Its a pretty good
match to the original vinyl but its a little lighter in color. The weight is
a bit thicker so getting the panels back into the rails was tight in some
places. When they ship it they fold it into a smaller box so make sure to
use some heat on the folds or you will see the wrinkles after its glued.
Hopefully the summer heat will take the wrinkles out of mine. It comes with
all the pieces that are visible without the upper bunk folded down. It looks
great once all installed. I would also suggest using the heavy duty 3M spray
adhesive. It holds a lot better.

Good luck
Jasan
