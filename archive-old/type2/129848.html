Subject: Re: [T2] Window Kits for '76?

Hi Ray,

For Arizona I would expect they're perfect. In wetter climates the 
jalouse's superior ability to deflect precipitation is pretty handy. 
I'd certainly prefer them to the vent-wing window used from 68-77.

Happy trails,

&gt; The 50/50 sliding windows were only
&gt; found on the late transporters (78&amp;79??). They
&gt; let in a lot of air when driving (I swapped my
&gt; jalousies for these) but you will have to make
&gt; your own screens
&gt;
&gt; I second Hotdog's comments.  These are great
&gt; windows, especially for hot Arizona summers.  But
&gt; I still don't think they'll fit in the passenger
&gt; or driver's window.  :)
