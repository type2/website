Subject: Re: [T2] VW Parts - JC Whitney???

I quit doing business with JC Whipme when i was stationed in Italy. They 
were easier to deal with in English than some of the local autoricambis 
(Italian FLAPS) but I got burned about 4 times in a row. I kept getting the 
wrong parts. Ordered a muffler for my VW Rabbit vert and got instead a 
Jetta muffler. Had to pay to get it cut and welded to fit my 'vert 'cause 
it was too expensive to send back.

Ordered a Beetle muffler for a 1300cc and got a 1600cc fuel injected Beetle 
muffler.

Ordered some rubber parts and got JUNK. Sun rotted in under a year. Was 
rubber gaskets for fenders, lights, bumpers, etc.

And so on.

I bought a '65 Beetle while I was in Napoli and it came with a JC Whipme 
catalog. Previous owner loved JC Whipme. Had the engine covered in chrome 
JC Whipme parts. Generator pulley wore out (got sloppy on the shaft), fan 
shroud had no internal baffles or air vanes, engine was a JC Whipme special 
and it gas up about 30K miles after it was installed (that's how I got it) 
with a ruined crank journal, rubber parts and gaskets were failing, carb 
was a nightmare, etc. etc. Previous owner did not get any value for her 
money. I bought the car as if the engine had failed though it was still 
running (so I got it cheap). It knocked but I drove it until it was 
hammering because I did not care about the engine (which overheated all the 
time). I had plans to install a better running 1200cc I had on hand when it 
died. I could not tune it to run as well as my previous stock '72 Super 
Beetle with a 1200cc motor which ran like a sewing machine.

That and their shipping was hugely expensive.

I can get the same tools these days from Harbor Freight or Northern Tools 
(among others) and I get my parts via the local FLAPS or a Type 2 list vendor.

Nope - I'm done with JC Whipme.
