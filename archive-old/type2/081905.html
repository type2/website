Subject: Re: [T2] high compression distributor vaccum cans

You need a working mid-76 to 78 single vacuum distributor. This would time at
7.5 before and give you 40-44 degrees total advance. P-mail me, I may be able
to help you.

&gt; hah with a strange subject like that you just had to read this right?
&gt;
&gt; doing a tune-up of my 75 solid 2.0L...
&gt;
&gt; I recently replaced the FI temp sensor (but forgot to hook it up so it ran
&gt; really poor and rich for a while... now there's an oxymoron). When I tuned
&gt; it up this last weekend (reconnecting the temp sensor) I did a compression
&gt; check - first one on a newly rebuilt engine. My compression was kinda
&gt; strange:
&gt; 1 144
&gt; 2 150
&gt; 3 139
&gt; 4 141
&gt;
&gt; These are all plenty high, but are they too high? Are the differences
&gt; (though high) bad? I've never seen compression numbers like these leading me
&gt; to believe that either the engine was put together really tightly (done by
&gt; Northwest Connecting Rods, after they accidentally sold me 2.0L pistons and
&gt; cylinders for my 1.8L engine - which I built and then ran with terrible
&gt; compression and power for a week before tearing it apart and realizing, when
&gt; I saw all the untouched silver in the pistons, that I had the right size),
&gt; or my compression gauge is off.
&gt;
&gt; Also, I had a shop suggest that I remove the vaccuum hoses from the vaccuum
&gt; can on the distributor as it is pretty much shot, plug them up (FI side that
&gt; is) and then set the advance to 28 at 2000RPM, which put it about 8 deg ATDC
&gt; at idle... I did it and it runs pretty well, though it seems to be flat in
&gt; third gear... does this sound ok? Should I look into getting a new
&gt; distributor? Should I start another distributor war over which would be the
&gt; best for my engine?
