Waht about Picklex (used to be Rassonil) http://rassonil_dot_com/


(1) Vosschemie zinc spray--made in Deutshland--a real heavy solids weld
through primer--
(2) Auto tech Rust Sheild-
Made in the USA--and a good heavy zinc rich weld through primer.
(3) 3-M Weld Through Primer--pretty runny--the spray nozzle always plugs
up in these cans--low solids, is not as good as the others.
