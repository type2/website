Subject: Steering Wheel Savvy

Hiya All,

I just took possession of what I understand to be the last OEM/NOS steering 
wheel for a 1970 Bus.
After 30+ years on the shelf it has its share of scratches and scuffs.  So, 
the question is...................
How does one go about polishing up a steering wheel?  Are there products/kits 
made for this purpose?  Websites?  Procedures?  Secret family recipies?  Any 
help at all will be appreciated - I know next to nothing about reconditioning 
plastic.  But I am willing to learn!

Mike
