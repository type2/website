Chris Mills sends:

&gt; We have had alot of Hondas and currently own one we bought new. Hate to
&gt; tell you this but Honda has been doing the same thing that VW has been
&gt; doing to after market suppliers and web site owners.

Add Mazda to that list. You know that neat little &quot;Miata&quot; script they use to
mark their roadsters? Those guys are ultra protective of that little script.
Not the word Miata, strangely enough, just the script.
