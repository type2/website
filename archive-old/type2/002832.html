I to was reluctant to compain about bus depot on this list but since other
people have had problems I would like to tell you my experience. After my
order didn't arive after 10 days I called and asked if it had been shipped
yet. He wouldn't tell me one way or the other if it had or not, so I waited
another week and I called and he said he canceled my order...without even
telling me. Wolfsburg West guys were professional, polite, and shipped my
