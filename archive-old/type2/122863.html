Hi Tim,

I had the identical scenario (including the wife!).  Turns out the
bushings that the throttle plate rod rides on were worn and I had a
sporadic vacuum leak.  The long and the short, a new carb (Brosol) did
the trick.  All is well with the bus and the wife!

Ok, my wife has about had it with me.  My low mileage 1600 dp keeps
stalling, usually not until after it warms up a while, and I come to a
stop.
I don't think it is the idle rpm.  I changed plugs and did points, timed
it,
change the fuel filter.   Now here may be a key, the plugs were black
with
what looked liked carbon.   What kind of leads might you have.

Tim
