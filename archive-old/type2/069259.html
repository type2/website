Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.
        Next week I'm commited to ordering the body parts I need. The
frontrunner as of now is BYI. I heard of Das Bulli Haus, and I am
wondering if anyone has had experience with these guys. If anybody has a
great reference please pass it on, I will do the same with my own
outcome. Many thanks,
                                John
