Subject: Fuel Filler Necks Restrictors

Wait a minute!!

So you say that the new fuel filler necks are sans leaded gas restrictors??

Well, it is not just California that shares this concern.  In Virginia, they 
still fit the leaded gas nozzle sizer into my fuel filler hole.  Of course, 
since I do NOT have the 1978 California model, the stupid leaded gas nozzle 
sizer fits right into my fuel filler hole.

Does this mean I fail?? Of course not, since I am not required to have the 
restrictor!!

So, why is the inspector putting the leaded gas nozzle sizer into my fuel 
filler inlet, when I am allowed to use leaded fuel, and I don't need to have 
a restrictor??  Simply because that is what they are required to do!!  
Cattle !!

What does this prove??  Simply that there is more [dumbness - or you may 
fill in appropriate words] in this world that we will ever be able to 
comprehend!!

Solution:

(1)  Steal [or relocate] the leaded gas fuel filler sizer just after the 
previous car's inspection.

(2)  Save the restrictor element from your current fuel filler neck, and 
attach it for the inspection.

(3)  With some ingenuity, it should be possible to fashion a restrictor for 
the inspection, fitting it under the gas cap attachment plate.

Think about it...
