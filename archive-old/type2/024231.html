Subject: beetle hood emblem
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL - A

Gentlepersons-
                       Anybody have a couple/three Beetle hood VW in a 
circle? Broken (mounting pins gone) are the ones I'm looking for. Rather 
recycle broken ones than
remove the pins from new to mount 'em as center caps on my alloy wheels.
