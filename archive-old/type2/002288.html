Subject: Spare tire for 75 bus, donut?
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2001 11:57:46 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Curious if there is anyone who has seen or knows of a place to find a spare
tire for a bus that is very narrow like a donut tire.  I took my big spare
off the front of my bus because I wanted the emblem not a tire up there but
I also don't want it in the spare tire place in the back of the bus taking
up room, what I want is the tire under the Z bed couch,  or I could put a
narrow tire in the storage compartment above the drivers head.

Where do I get one of these?

Thanks,
Bob
