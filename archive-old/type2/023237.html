Hello folks - got a MacGyver question for you. I'm interested in using an 
older LCD screen from a dead laptop computer as a TV monitor in my Westy 
(or anywhere else I need a screen).

Does anyone know if this possible, and how?

Trying to make do with what I have on hand without searching wrecked Warner 
Bros. Edition minivans or buying $1500 computer monitors, or breaking into 
one of the local university buildings. .

Thanks!
