&gt; Call me sick, but the first thing that came to mind was that episode of The
&gt; Simpson's when all the kids get video camera to tape a school project. It's
&gt; the scene when Bart tried to kick over the jacked up car so it falls on
&gt; Homer and can't get it to tip. He then says &quot;Who knew you could hold up a
&gt; car with a wicker basket!&quot;
&gt; 
&gt;

   And, according to Wile E. Coyote, as long as you don't look down,
you won't fall into the canyon... ;-)
