Subject: Re: [T2] Shift Rod Adjustments

&quot;I can't get the shift rod and tranny to meet all the way up.&quot;

Are you saying the shift rod is too short?

I've got a '79 engine and tranny in my '74 and I had to bend the crossmember
by the shift rod fork thingy just so I could get it into 2nd &amp; fourth. Now
the gear shift is further away from the dash than before.
