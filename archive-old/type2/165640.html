Subject: Re: [T2] engine oil additive problems coming? ? 

The discussion of the last couple of days reminded me that
I didn't know what I didn't know.  Would it be possible
to make up a short buyers' guide and put it in or around
the type2_dot_com Library (where http://www.atis_dot_net/oil_faq.html
is, for example) -- and by &quot;short&quot; I mean something I can
fold up in my pocket when I need to go buy some oil.
