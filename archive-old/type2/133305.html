&gt; helpfull. I am aware that this is a 30 year old car, and it will require
&gt; more maintenance, but I have no problems with that. I do intend to use
&gt; this as my daily driver, presently with a round trip of about 40 miles.

remember that message that said it will cost you $4-5,000 to get a
reliable bus.  that is about accurate, I guess I spent at least that much
getting mine reliable and dependable.    and count on about a $50-100 a
month in regular upkeep.

&gt; And I am looking forward to driving slower, and planning things ahead a
&gt; bit more.

enjoy the scenery and plan ahead...
