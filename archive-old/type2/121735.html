Subject: Fuel Pressure Checking Made Easy

I frequently hear of people wanting to check the fuel pressure on their fuel
injection and it always seems to be a real chore.  When I resurrected the FI
on my 74 914 2.0 many years ago I bought a VDO 1.5 inch 0-60 psi pressure
gauge (VDO # 153-008) and permanently mounted it in my engine bay.  

I hooked it in between the fuel rail and the pressure regulator so anytime I
want to see what my fuel pressure is, I just pop my engine hatch and there
it is.  For mounting, I just put a piece of bicycle-tube rubber around it
and secured it with a 1.5&quot; hose clamp to a piece of scrap metal that is
bolted to a the engine compartment.

Bus Depot doesn't list these gauges, but I assume Ron could get them if
anybody wants them.  If not, here's at a link showing the gauge and a price:
