Subject: RE:  Engine movement

&gt;didn't bother bolting the transmission back up.  Therefore my bus
&gt;(1972) engine was only supported by the one bracket near the back.
&gt;As can be imagined, my engine rocked quite  bit, which I was
&gt;concerned about.  However, after getting everything put back together,
&gt;correctly, my engine doesn't rock at all, I'm wondering if it's

&gt;With the transmission bolted to the rear (front is front) &gt;mount
&gt;and the engine secured to the transmission there should be very &gt;little
&gt;.movement allowed.

My engine seems to shake more than normal.
I was told by a mechanic that I should replace the engine mounts
but it was no hurry he said.
They wanted $350 bucks for the job!!!!
The rubber mounts on the mounting bar are the only mounts I
could visibly see, and they -seemed- ok.
Any places to look for problems or suggestions?

thanks alex,
