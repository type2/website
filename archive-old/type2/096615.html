Subject: Engine start help re-visited

I posted a couple days ago asking how to test start an engine in a bus with no ignition switch and unknown wiring. Thanks for all your guys' help (Matt roberds, steve dolan, Ronnie, and many others which I am now forgetting) I grounded everything, then I put the hot wire from the battery on the + side of the coil, also ran the hot battery wire to the big terminal on the starter solenoid. Ran a wire from the small solenoid terminal (ignition switch terminal) and when I touched this wire to the hot side of the battery it should start, right?! Well, it did turn over but I could only get one turn of the engine at a time. I electrify the ignition wire and I get one &quot;Whooomp&quot; as the engine turn over, then another &quot;Whooomp&quot; as it turns over again, but it won't turn fast enough to get the engine to start.  The bus is a 66 Kombi, the engine is a 1600 DP.  As per the advice found in the Type2 Library, I put a 6 volt flywheel on the 12 volt engine so I didn't have to grind or replace bel!
l-housing. The starter is still 6 volt but according to the Library, when 12 volts is applied to a 6 volt starter it should turn faster, right? The engine DOES turn freely by hand and the engine ran when it was pulled from a bug a few months ago. The battery I am using DOES have a full charge (charged it myself). So, Is the starter possibly getting tired and just doesn't have the &quot;Umpf&quot; to get the engine turning over fast enough, or is there something else I am missing?
