&gt; Thanks for all the advice, everyone! It was *extremely* helpful. I
called
&gt; around today and finally found a Les Schwaab who had the 185R14's in
with 8
&gt; ply. I paid about $330 for all of them, and that's with warranty and
&gt; installation. The bus runs so much nicer now. 
&gt; 
&gt; I really appreciate all the information that was sent to quickly. My
next
&gt; tire/wheel project will be to have the wheels sandblasted and
painted. 

Gee, I would have done that before installing the tires!  :)

Could you pass some info along about your new tires?  If you could
copy the brand, size, load range letter, and load rating in a single
post it would make a good addition to the archives.  Also, were these
tires M+S rated?
