Subject: Interior Panel Patterns, Etc.

First off, thank everyone who provided advice on the 120V circuit =
breaker.  A trip to Doc Freemans (a local marine supply store in =
Seattle) yielded the exact part I needed for $1.27.  There were lots of =
other things worth investigating too.  Being  a new VW owner after =
having had old SAABs, it's great to receive this kind of helpful info =
without pretense or group politics.

Anyway, I'm getting ready to re-do the interior panels in my '71 Westy, =
but am missing a few pieces that I need patterns for.  I'm looking for =
templates for the door panels, sliding door panel, and the kick panels.  =
Likewise, I'd also be willing to trace headliner patterns if anyone =
wanted a set. =20

Also, does anyone know the correct height for the rubber stand-off =
bumpers that mount under the rear of the luggage rack?  Mine are =
trashed, and before I fabricate something, I'd like to make sure it's =
right.

Thanks again,
Hal Landvoigt
