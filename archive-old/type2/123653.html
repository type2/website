Subject: Re: [T2] Bad hydraulic lifters (rant)

%
%&quot;Rock hard&quot; is a relative term.  You shouldn't be able to compress a
good
%lifter by hand but it'll still do it's job properly when subjected to
the
%forces existing in a running engine.   If you look in your Bentley
you'll
%see that one way suggested to compress a lifter outside the engine is
to put
%it (horizontally) in a vice and use the vice as a press.

If you were to look at a catalog like Jegs or Summit, you will find
lifters with anti-pump up mechanisms.

Pumped up lifters are those which are unable to bleed down and
therefore remain &quot;rock hard&quot; i.e. act like solid lifters.

A pumped up lifter should be replaced during a rebuild and I believe
that that is what I found in my rebuilt engine.

As someone kindly pointed out, 1200 miles over 1 year means that the
Vanagon was sitting a lot. That means that the lifters would have time
to bleed down. If you have 7 bled down lifters (partially or
otherwise) and one that is still &quot;rock hard&quot; you have to suspect that
there is something wrong with that &quot;rock hard&quot; one, especially if it
was on a cylinder with 60 psi compression.

I'll be bringing that one lifter to a VW shop over the next couple of
days to get an opinion. We'll see what happens.

Anyway, the important thing now is to get that Vanagon running again.
Anyone know of a dance that brings fair weather? :-)
