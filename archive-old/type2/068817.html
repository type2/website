Thanks all for the many replies and suggestions.  I'm off to clean and 
grease and to buy a larger hammer. 

I'm taking a day off tomorrow to drive the 400 KM to Toronto to visit a 
VW remanufacturing plant.   It deals with engines.  I discovered rebuild 
stickers on the engine I found in the 73 part van, called the plant and 
they invited me to come down and have a look!  So, I am.

Thanks all and good night!
