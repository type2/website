Subject: Re: Selling CA Bus out of state???

&gt;stuck me between a rock and a hard place.  In CA, the owner must smog =
&gt;the vehicle before selling it.  So I'm not sure I could get it smogged =

        Don't bother. Knock a couple hundred off the asking price, and make
sure the buyer knows a smog cert is his problem. I've *never* smogged a
vehicle before selling it-and my Texas mail address is because I'm an out
of state student-I still have CA residency. So far I've sold 5 cars in CA
without smogs. The law says the seller must provide, but DMV doesn't care
as long as a cert shows up with the paperwork. And if the other guy finds a
station willing to hook up a Pinto to the machinery and call it the bus,
that's between him and DMV.

&gt;from one state to a person in another?  i.e. Do I need a smog =
&gt;certificate from CA before selling it, what paperwork is necessary, etc. =
&gt; Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

        That will depend on the requirements of the specific state. You
sell it to a AZ resident, you play by AZ rules, CA doesn't matter anymore.
In Texas there's a specific form you must fill out, buyer and seller, no
matter where the vehicle comes from. In short, talk to the interested
party, and tell him to do the research. If he screws up, it's his problem.
Good incentive not to screw up...

Peace,
