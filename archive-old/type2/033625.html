&gt;Question: Are the any differences between a VW 2.0L and a 914  2.0L ?
&gt; gary in SF

Quite a few, the 2.0 914 is the only T4 engine that was really different in fact.
Basically pistons, and most importantly a massively (well as massively as
you could in the size constraints) redesigned head.  Recognized by the
3 intake mounting studs.  Most 914's had the windage tray installed, and I
think the &quot;earlier&quot; case persisted with the lack of the little oil pocket on the
pickup thoughout 914 poduction, as well of course as the 914 oil filling
system.  As far as performance, I think 914 2.0 pistons are dished, as
flat tops are available, but piston top design, CR, and the heads (better
valve and port angles) gave the 2.0 in the 914 somewhat respectable performance
for the day in a light mid engined chassis.  Not the 6 but not too bad, my
'74 was quite fun.  Flywheel different of course as well.  None of this
prevents its use with proper swaps but as the 914 heads are extremely rare
and as you can build performance to an extent with the VW parts, not
worth seeking out actively.  The only thing of any value is the windage tray
and they run about $50 used but the seals are about $40 go into any T4 case.
