Hey Richard  Looks like the cost is coming down.  At one point there weren't 
any to be found in Std. Std.    check out the Bosch Al82N  alt..  backordered  
now you can get the remans  but not the new ones,  watch and see that the 
price will go up when they do arrive.  Also there are the times when they will 
show something but then don't have it.  Later  Mark Dearing
