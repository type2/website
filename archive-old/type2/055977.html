Subject: gas fumes inside 78 Westy

Now that we have a new baby (www.monad_dot_net/~sjtickner) we are very concious 
of the gas fumes in the back end of our 78 westy. We had the motor rebuilt 
two years ago and at that time, to deal with this problem, I replaced the 
old cracked rubber tank filler tube with a genuine ($$!) VW replacement, 
put in a new sender with new seal, and checked all the vent line 
connections carefully. My charcoal cannister seems to be working. It smells 
like gas and all the connections are there and when I rev the engine the 
valve to the airbox does seem to open up. I tried to carefully track down 
any holes between the gas tank comaprtment and the passenger comaprtment 
and seal them. Still, it stinks of gas back there. My first 78 Westy had 
this same problem but it was also very rusty and I was young and didn't 
know where to start. Any suggestions on how to deal with it?
