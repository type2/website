Hello all,
    Well, if you recognize the email, you will know that I was the one
that had all the wiring in the front of my bus taken apart (even taken
off the fuse panel).  Well, its all back together and I will be picking
my baby up this weekend hopefully.  However, one problem, my horn isnt
working.  All the wiring has been replaced in the column for it, but I
am missing a piece that the button sits on.  I have the button, and
thats it.  Whats the metal piece that the button sits on called, and
where can I find one?  Ive looked in the archives and in my Bentley but
can't find much.  Thanks for all the help, with this and with getting my
bus back up and running, your all life savers.
