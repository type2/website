Don,

The knob, when pulled out (about an inch seems right), will redirect some of
the front heater flow to the walkway floor (just aft of between the front
seats). You should be able to see the small step that the vent makes. This
will ensure that those 7'6&quot; occupants in the back seat keep their toes
toasty.

And, Yes. Like my brother told me years ago: &quot;Ground is Ground&quot;.

&gt; I've tried to trace the location, and or function of the pull knob behind
my
&gt; right calf under the driver'seat.  It seeems to lead to a heat junction
under
&gt; the seat, but what part of the heat does it control?  I think it's frozen
&gt; anyway - moves about an inch when I pull it.  I get good heat from the
&gt; defrosters, and the vents in the kick panels regardless of what position
it
&gt; is in.  I've seen vents behind the seats in other busses, but mine doesn't
&gt; have/need them there.  Rediculously stupid question #2.  Is it ok to
ground
&gt; more than one thing at a single bolt on the chassis?
&gt;
&gt; thanks - Don
