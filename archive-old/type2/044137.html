Subject: Re: [T2] Dreaded Squeak, inspection results

&gt; after inspection i noticed that the pad is rubbing the disc every half
&gt; turn.
&gt; it does stop when i brake. there is no roar
&gt; like described, so, it shouldn't be the bearing, but i am having it
&gt; checked out by a trusted VW mechanic on monday, so we'll see what
&gt; happens. any advice on how i can seperate the pad, and save some money
&gt; would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; thanx for the responses-

&gt; My guess is that their is a spring retainer of some sort that clips on the
edges of the pad to hold it in the retainer......either that or your disc is
warped, or no torqued properly.
