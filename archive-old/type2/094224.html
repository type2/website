Subject: Re: [T2] enigne woes - mucho backfiring

I have struggled with backfiring since I have had my bus.  I have found many
things cause backfiring.  This is my list:

Vacuum leaks, from brake booster, balance pipe, other locations.

Exhaust system leaks.

Valves too loose.

Bad timing

Idle mixture too lean.



I have never found the cause to be the carburetors.  Although, monkeying
with the carbs can eliminate or minimize backfiring and can fool you into
thinking that you have solved the problems that way.  I had backfiring from
a badly leaking brake booster and I was able to tune most of it away with
the carbs.  This is the wrong thing to do, it masked the real problem, which
I discovered the minute I tried to stop.

For synching the carbs, I recommend the procedures in Bentley.

&gt; Ok, I took Zeke out for a spin around the block yesterday, I was getting alot
&gt; of backfiring.  Some at idle, alot on decel.  I have replaced points, plugs,
&gt; cap, rotor, wires.  Adjusted valves, dwell, timing.  My timing is set to
&gt; 5ATDC.  Just can not figure it out.  The only thing i have not done is synch
&gt; the carbs.  I have the rebuild kits for my carbs and perhaps it's time to
&gt; rebuild? Any suggestions would be great
