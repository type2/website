Karl Von Salzen told me a trick I've had use for twice now : Pop off the
left hand valve cover, and when the #3 exh valve just closes, and the intake
valve JUST wants to open, #1 cylinder is at TDC. I've had 2 vehicles with
multi-knicks in the pulley..and this was the only way that worked in
determining the real TDC. The busses have been running right-on for over 10K
each now.

Good luck, Marv Krupp


&gt;&gt;How do I get piston#1 to firing position at TDC
