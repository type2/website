&gt;&gt;I have a '77 westy that is white, actually it is an off white.  
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know what color number this is so I can get some 
&gt;&gt;touchup paint. 
&gt;
&gt;If it is really a Westy (angled poptop, etc.), then it was not 
&gt;originally white.  If it has a stove, it was originally Tiaga Green 
&gt;(also called Sage Green).  If it has no stove it was Chrome Yellow.

I have seen one poptop and two hardtop '77 Deluxe Westfalias that 
were &quot;real&quot; and had Pearl White original paint.  All had green 
interiors like the Sage Green ones had.
