Subject: 78 Westy 2.0 Injection problem

I have a problem with my westy that Ive been trying to
fix for 5 years. (its just a pain, not too bad)

For the first few minutes after a cold start it runs
fine (you can mat it and the power is constant and
clean). After a few minutes it hesitates at low rpm
high load (any gear same condition). At high RPM and
lower load, it doenst seem to hesitate (miss?).  It
misses intermittantly while idling.  Runs great, does
not use oil, decent gas mileage (better than my solex'd
71)

List of things Ive tested very well:
-Reset timing.
-Changed Condenser/Coil/points/wires/plugs/rotor
-Replaced Air filter (seems to make it somewhat better)

-Sealed up all vacuum lines/replaced lines and tie
wrapped in place.
-Tried another ECU.
-Oil pressure is fine
-Checked Temp sensor (volt/ohmmeter).
-Replaced Fuel filter
-Clutch (mechanic told me the seal was leaking and
hesitation was due to the clutch was slipping)
-EGR disconnected (by previous owner) mechanical valve
position makes no difference.

Things I have checked reasonably well:
-Mass flow sensor seems fine (volt/ohmmeter tested)
-Auxilary air regulator (tested seals and opens)
-Cold start injector makes no difference connected or
not.
-System voltage (stable no battery problems either)
-Wiring harness connectors, grounds

Things I have not checked since I dont think they will
make a difference
-Fuel pressure
-Injector output rates

I keep trying to think what would cause this after a
few minutes of driving (in winter I can almost get 4
miles before it starts).
Help??!!
Many thanks

10W30 for winter driving, break out the block heater!
