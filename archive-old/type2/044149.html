Subject: [T2] A warning to all VW mechanics (F)

A Friday posting for all that like (or have)to work on their VWs.
The following was sent to me recently and perhaps some of you
will appreciate it.

I don't know if a VW was involved but I'd like to think so...

                  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~


Be careful what you wear (or don't wear), when working under your 
vehicle...especially in public. 

&gt;From the Sydney Morning Herald Australia comes this story of a central
west couple who drove their car to K-Mart only to have their car 
breakdown in the parking lot. 

The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the
car.
The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car.
On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under 
the chassis. 

Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private
parts into glaringly public ones. 

Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward and
tucked everything back into place. On regaining her feet she looked 
across the hood and found herself staring at her husband who was 
standing idly by.

The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.

                  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~

True story or urban myth? I have no idea...

Cheers,
