Subject: Hard Start Relay?
Message-ID: &lt;3814BC57.4EA64D61_at_aztek-eng_dot_com&gt;

I'm having intermittent problems starting my '78 2.0L FI engine.
Occasionally, when I turn the key, the starter does absolutely nothing.
So I either have to push start it or short the terminals on the starter
with a screwdriver.  Is this something that can be circumvented with the
Hard Start Relay, or does it sound like my starter has a dead spot?

It is my understanding the Hard Start Relay simply shortens the distance
b/t the battery and the starter which the current must travel and
eliminates many old (and bad) connections.  How difficult is it to
replace the original wiring and connections?  Any ideas?  Is it a big
PITA?

Thanks in Advance...
