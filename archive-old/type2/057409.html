&lt;As I posted yesterday, my engine is out of my 1970 Camper (1600SP) and I
am
&lt;wondering about those fan shroud flaps (technical term).
&lt;What is the general opinion on keeping them or removing them?  

Volkswagen put *no* inessential parts on your volkswagen engine.  Indeed,
they put few inessential parts on the Volkswagen itself.  Professor Porsche
was a firm believer in the old axiom, &quot;parts left out of assembly cause no
service problems and cost nothing.&quot;  Don't believe me?  Consider this:  How
many millions of Type1 engines did VW manufacture?  If those flaps cost
$.50 to manufacture (and they are on *all* type1 engines... from 1945
straight through to 1998), they still cost the factory *millions* of
dollars to manufacture.  Hundreds of millions.  They would not do that if
the flaps were not an essential part.

Economics aside, your flaps are one of the most vital parts of your cooling
system.  They direct cooling air to the cylinder heads, the hottest part of
the engine.  They also open and close (guided by the thermostat and spring
--you *do* have the thermostat and spring, don't you?) to allow the engine
to warm up quicker (increasing engine life), and to cool the engine off
once warmed up.  

Do *not* take your flaps off.  Make certain that they are working properly,
that they have the spring attached to the rod connecting them, and that the
thermostat is controlling them.  You will find instructions on how to do
this in the Type2 archives.  

Go to http://www.type2_dot_com/ to search the archives.  You should do this
before posting to the mailing list, every time you have a question; many
questions (such as this one) have been asked --and answered-- before, and
you can get your answers quicker there, without adding to mailing list
traffic.  

&lt;I seem to
&lt;think that if they were off that it would be the same difference as
keeping
&lt;them wide open, which would be a good thing.  

If they are off, the air will *not* blow onto the cylinder head fins, the
most critical cooling area of the engine.  Your engine *will* burn itself
up within 20,000 miles... or less! ...if they are off.  I know; my engine
(&quot;rebuilt&quot; by a crooked garage for the PO) had the flaps off when I bought
it... and I just had to perform a very long, expensive, and complicated
overhaul of the engine because of that.  

This is not an opinion.  It is a *fact*.  Leave the flaps on, your engine
will thank you.  

&lt;I do not know the use of
&lt;having them closed...Preheating in winter months?  

Warming the engine up takes place in *all* seasons.  You don't want cooling
air preventing it; most engine wear takes place in the first few minutes of
engine running.  

&lt;Related to the flaps...I still have the cable intact that connects to the
&lt;air filter from the flaps.  Obviously if I remove the flaps, this goes
away
&lt;as well.  Is that a bad thing?

The cable from the air filter to the flaps controls a small lever on the
air filter; it switches the intake of the filter from the engine
compartment to the area below the engine compartment, to help fight
carbeurator icing in the winter.  It's a fairly lame fix; VW changed it in
'71 to a seperate thermostat attached to the air filter.  Nonetheless, you
still want it; leave it.  It isn't hurting you.
