Subject: [T2] '71 turn signals don't flash.

OK, I need some community wisdom.

'71 station wagon.

Turn signals come on but do not flash.  Turn signal indicator lights in
 the instrument cluster do not come on when the switch is operated.

When I pull out the emergency flasher knob, the signal lights light, the
knob itself lights, but the lights do not flash.  the indicator lights in
the instrument cluster do not light.  However, the indicator lights in the
instrument cluster _do_ come on if I pull the emergency flasher knob out
halfway, so the lights themselves are OK.

In a nutshell, what I'm missing is the flashing and the instrument panel
indicator.

The flasher was a bit flaky in the past, blinking faster than normal.  All
bulbs light, so I suspect that something finally gave up in the flasher
part of the relay.

I wiggled all the fuses.  No joy.

I suspect the emergency flasher relay (J2 in bentley), but before I pull
out that fragile fuse block I wanted to check if anyone had any other
suggestions.

If it is that, any suggestions about replacements?  The schematic shows
three termimals.  (31) goes to ground(brn). (+) goes to the emergency
flasher switch (wht).  (49a) goes to the indicator lights (blu/red) and to
the turn signal switch (blu).

I'm having a heck of a time figuring out how all this works.  The white
wire is fat and the (+) label seems to say that this is the hot wire.  The
other fat wire is the blue one that goes to the turn signal switch.
The brown ground wire is thin, indicating that it is ground only for the
relay itself.
Unfortunately I don't know what connections make or break inside the turn
signal or emergency flasher switches.  The book says that the same flasher
relay serves both the emergency and turn signal purposes but I haven't
twigged to the how of it yet.

Any suggestions will be appreciated!
