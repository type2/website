Subject: Re: thermostat and flaps

When I bought my 1978 Westfalia in south San Diego County, CA, 7 years 
ago it had flaps but no thermostat. I junkyard scavenged a bracket, 
bought a nrew thermostat and hooked it up. Found that the little screw 
that holds the tightened wire was cheesy.Parts bus scavnstalled it. 
Thermostat worked OK for a few years, then pooped out. Flaps defaulted 
to open position. 

Since then I've read a lot of opinion about it here and elsewhere. 
General consensus is that:  

1- As John Muir wrote, you should have thermostat and flaps if you live
where &quot;it gets even a little bit cold.&quot; 

2- thermostats (little brass accordions) tend to break by leaking. Then
they stretch easily and too long, so the springloaded flaps go to the open
position. This is touted as a &quot;safe fail&quot; VW design feature.

3- new thermostats are a good idea. Junk yard thermostats hardly ever
work. New ones are about $20 last time I checked. 

4- Even without a thermostat, you ought to leave the flaps in place
because they (especially the one on the driver's side?) help direct air
over the cylinders. Removing them would crete new air gaps, for example 
where the pivots for the flaps come through the tin. It is unclear how 
removing flaps would affect airflow through the oil cooler on a pancake 
engine the driver's side flap directs some air into the oil cooler. 
Presumably removing it would put less air through the oil cooler and 
maybe a bit more though the driver's side cylinders?

OK, so much for the condensed common wisdom. I have a few points of my 
own to add. 
1- The adjustment/attachment screw for the thermostat cable is cheesy. It 
takes 3 hands to adjust it, strips easily, and is hard to tighten enough 
to hold the cable without stripping it. But one listee several years back 
had a great idea for me. I've never tried it, but I'm sure it will work 
great! He recommended using the cable holder from a bicycle handbrake to 
hold the cable. What an obviously superior design. He also suggested that 
brass wound steel guitar strings make dandy replacements for the stock 
thermostat cable, which often strips and frays over time.

2- Once I overtightened my cable, effectively holding my flaps closed 
under all conditions. This is the dreaded &quot;flaps closed&quot; scenario that 
many invoked when arguing to remove the whole shebang for safety. Yes, my 
bus ran a little hot. Yes it was easy to detect from my oil temperature 
gauge. No, it did not run dangerously hot. I just ran at about 240 
degrees instead of 210 degrees. Maybe it would be more dire in a hotter 
climate than southern CA.

3- my brand new thermostat broke after about 4 years. Check 'em often. 
It's not just the cable connection that is flaky. 

4- I've run without a functioning thermostat in Santa Barbara CA and 
hereabouts for about 4 years and 25,000 miles. I have often wondered if I 
was wearing my engine out by running without a thermostat (and with an 
extra oil cooler that also does not have a thermostat oil shunt) and thus 
having slower than designed warmups. My rod bearings looked great when I 
did a top end rebuild recently, which made me feel that I must not be 
doing anything too badly wrong. My oil reaches operating temperatures 
of 180+ degrees F most of the time in about 10 minutes of driving.
