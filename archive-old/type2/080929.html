Tom,

The short answer is no, altitude will not affect vacuum gauge readings.
However, as you already know, altitude affects engine power, so at a higher
altitude, you will need to operate at a lower indicated vacuum than at sea
level.  Lower vacuum = more air volume to the cylinders.

Conveniently, for every 1000' of altitude, ambient air pressure (and
manifold pressure) drops by about 1&quot;.  As a San Diego (sea level) bus
operator, I try to limit my cruise and hill climb power to 5&quot; of vacuum so
I'm not &quot;maxing out&quot; my engine all the time.  But when I go over the
mountains, for every 1000' of altitude, I lose some power, so I allow myself
another 1&quot; of vacuum to make up for it.  Example: Mountain Pass at 3000' I
climb at 2&quot; of vacuum. At 5000', I'm wide open (vacuum = 0&quot;). If I can't
maintain speed at 50 MPH on a hill using the appropriate vacuum, I downshift
to 3rd.  The government tends to label altitudes on highways so you don't
need a barometer.

My method is a bit detailed, but hopefully you get the idea.  At 7000' you
will probably be at 0&quot; vacuum to climb hills anyway, but if you drive down
to the flatlands you can use your vacuum gauge to manage your power.  It
also is a good trend tool for general engine health.  My typical readings
are:

77' Westy 2.0L FI, Sea Level
Cold Idle:  10-12&quot;
Hot Idle:	17-21&quot;
Cruise at 60 MPH:  10-11&quot;   (Head/Tail Winds can make a BIG difference here)
Climb at 50-60 MPH:  No Less than 5&quot;, adjusted for altitude.

My idle vacuum and RPM's do vary with air temperature, since my cooling
hardware is a work in progress.  I suspect when I get a thermostat it will
idle consistently around 19&quot;. Have fun with your vacuum gauge!

From your experience, does altitude affect your vacuum readings? I Live at
7000
ft and was just wondering if you ever noticed if vacuum decreased with
altitude.
Thanks

&gt; An in-dash vacuum gauge is very nice to have IMO, and amusing on long
&gt; trips.  It can also alert you to a potential problem with your
&gt; engine.  I've been running one for several years - here is my installation
&gt; for anyone that's interested.  There is also a picture of the Vanagon
&gt; speedo (6-digit odometer plus resettable trip meter) installed in my
&gt; baywindow dashboard.
