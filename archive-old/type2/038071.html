Subject: Hoover Bit/Karl Thank You

I have in my possesion my only ever complete hoover bit. Thanks to
everybodys favorite benefactor and junkyard diver supreme, Karl Van S.
I am going to use  it to show how to make your own hoover bit from one
flat bit of sheet metal and then I will polish it and store it with my
most treasured possesions.
Thanks again Karl. You Rock.

BTW every engine Ive had had the skinny side of the bit broken off.
