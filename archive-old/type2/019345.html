You got lucky.  When the the generator light goes on, the procedure for an
air-cooled engine is to get off the road to a point of safety as fast as you can
and turn the engine off.  Don't try to make it to &quot;the next exit.&quot;  You don't
have that much time once the belt breaks.  Unfortunately, I have second hand
experience in this department.

&gt; I was headed to the beach in my 1972 7 seater.  After a week diagnosing carb
&gt; troubles and believing all was well.  About 10 miles out, the brake light
&gt; and gen light came on.  I figure, no problem, I have a spare belt.  I drive
&gt; to the next exit and park at a YMCA.  I pop the lid and see one hot engine.
&gt; Smoke everywhere, boiling oil sounds.  I notice the the fan protection grid
&gt; is out of whack and the timing ruler, too.  The belt is intact.  I then
&gt; notice that the fan is out of position.  I grab it, with a rag, it being all
&gt; hot and all, and it is completely loose.  I take my time, remove the belt,
&gt; let if cool, and pop off the plastic cone and find the bolt is loose.  I
&gt; take out the bolt, it looks fine.  I then try to position the fan, but I
&gt; find no definite position.  Knowing that that fan has to be somewhat
&gt; precisely positioned, having the timing mark on i, I tried to determine
&gt; where it blonged, by feel.  I just twisted it until it seemed secure and
&gt; rebolted into position.  The engine started and ran fine.  I was almost
&gt; tempted to go to the beach anyway, but I opted for the pool instead.  It
&gt; seems to be running fine, thank goodness.  But how do I reposition this fan?
&gt; Are there other issues that are being overlooked by me.  I was very glad to
&gt; be able to fix it and continue on.  It is running very nice and cool.
