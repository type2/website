Subject: Re: [WetWesties] Weird engine startup today in my 2.0 L 79 westy

I'd suspect condensation in your fuel tank or even water if its been
raining heavy in your area.

&gt; My van sat for the day in dismal rainy weather, it really poured all 
&gt; day.
&gt; When I went out to start it, it just turned over and over. I popped 
&gt; the
&gt; dizzy cap thinking it was wet inside, (engine was all dry) but it 
&gt; was dry. I
&gt; went back and turned it over again, and pumped the pedal which is a 
&gt; no-no
&gt; with fuel injection. It finally caught and fired up, but ran just 
&gt; like a
&gt; carb does when it's totally over-choked. It chugged along on what 
&gt; sounded
&gt; like 1 cylinder (you know like mega choke on a carburetor) - chug - 
&gt; chug -
&gt; chug, as I feathered the pedal up and down, and finally gave it 2/3 
&gt; gas, and
&gt; it cleared itself as the revs went up, but it took about 10-15 
&gt; seconds. Then
&gt; it ran and idled fine. Shut it off and it started up normally? What 
&gt; do you
&gt; guys think? cold start injector? I swear it ran just like my old 
&gt; carbureted
&gt; Ford did when it was way overchoked.
&gt; Thanks for any direction,
&gt; Courtney
