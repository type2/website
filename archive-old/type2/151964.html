&gt; I've wanted (for several years now) one of those old GE electric lawn tractors. Supposedly has pretty of juice for a 2 acre yard and there were dozens of electric attachments including a welder. I'm tired of the B&amp;S racket. Now adays I have a tiny yard and trees so a reel mower would be perfect.

have the photos of a guy in a power wheelchair pulling three reel mowers
over his lawn.....
