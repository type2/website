Subject: Re: [T2] injectors, aren't??

Okay, WTH - I might as well say it: Is the ecu wire on
the correct coil terminal? -BaH

 the continuing saga of the 78 2liter FI engine.  I
 can get engine to start
 from ether, but the injectors are not firing.
 
 have gone thru the troubleshooting guide step by
 step
 (remember this was a working engine before putting a
 new long block in.)
 
 every step.
 
. test light at injector does not flicker weakly.
 
 . double relay works fine (35psi fuel presure)
 . trigger impulse is present at term #1 of control
 unit
 . correct voltage on pins # 10-5  10-16 and 10-17
 
 conclusion, control unit defective
 
 but I have several spares and have tried em, what
 are the odds of 6
 control units having the same defect???  I've never
 seen a bad control
 unit in almost 20 years of driving a FI VW....
 
 still at none of the injector plugs do I get the
 &quot;weak flicker&quot; and I've
 seen it often enough to know what it looks like...
 
 what else is left, nice fat spark, lots of presure,
 engine will start and
 run on ether, (for a moment or so)
 
 ????????
 
 thanks
 Bob
