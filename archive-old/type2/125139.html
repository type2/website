Subject: custom bug muffler for 1971 bus

I always used a standard bug muffler on my 1971 bus. A bug muffler has two
holes for two tail pipes. I did NOT use the standard bug straight tailpipes.
The bug tail pipes have some sound deadening qualities in them. This sound
deadening is like the &quot;glass pack&quot; mufflers that all the hot rodders want.
The bug straight tail pipes are not safe for use on a bus. When a bus is
moving down the road, there is a huge vacuum following it. The bug straight
tailpipes squirt the poisonous exhaust gases into this vacuum. The vacuum
sucks the poisonoust exhaust gasses into the passenger compartment. The
single outlet bus tail pipe is long and has a curved tip. This special bus
tailpipe carries the poisonous exhaust gases way out to the side and squirts
the poisonous exhaust gasses into a slip stream sliding by the side of the
bus to get the exhaust away from the bus.

I always used a two outlet hole standard bug muffler on my bus. But I used
TWO  of the bus type long tailpipes. One bus tailpipe fits in the normal
factory position. The other second bus tailpipe has to be installed upside
down and you have to weld a support bracket to the bug muffler to hold it up.
A long time ago, when I did this regularly, the bug mufflers were super cheap
and the bus mufflers were expensive. It still cost me less money to buy a bug
muffler and TWO bus tail pipe assemblies. I always thought that my bus engine
ran cooler with the way less restricted TWO hole bug muffler with two tail
pipes for exhaust gasses to escape.
