Subject: FI Boogosity: 12v on both sides of FI plugs?
Message-ID: &lt;GDPHFANIEELCAAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Hey, it's me again, the continuous troubleshooter. Someday I'm going to finally get it right and by then I'll know enough to be dangerous. I bought the Bosch FI book and I'm reading it, so watch out! (BTW, this is a GREAT, easy-to-read, instructionally well-designed book; Mr. Probst did an outstanding job simplifying and teaching fuel injection IMHO...it's published by Robert Bentley Publishers.) While I was at it, I snuck in a new digital multimeter ($15 at Sears) and a fuel pressure gauge ($45 at Sears); now I need to rig up a Schrader valve on the fuel ring so I can actually use the pressure gauge.

I've got an intermittent wiring problem. I fiddled with the wires the other day and actually got the bus running for a few minutes. I thought it was in the FI harness on the right side, but I'm not so sure.

What I have is continuity between the FI plug contacts. That is, unplug one of the injectors and run a ohm meter between the plugs and viola...continuity. If I turn the key on, each side has 12 volts to it. Now, I thought one of these was supposed to be ground?

When I remove the plug to the control unit, I no longer have continuity between the injector plug terminals. Now, a normal person might assume: &quot;it's the brain.&quot; But I'm anything but normal and I know that there are several components interconnected with that brain and I'm thinking it's probably one of the components connected in the harness somewhere. I also suspected the connection to the temp sensor, but I fiddled with that today with no change...maybe continuity at the sensor itself, but I kinda doubt it.

Anyone ever run up on something like this before? BTW, it rained since I last started the bus. This happened to me once before...that it was running; then it rained and it would start no more. Nothing's getting rain-soaked, though...except me, out there scratching my head and walking back and forth from the key to the engine compartment.

Thanks! Joe
