Subject: RE: [T2] door handles

I had a similar problem once. I took the door panels off to do something and
when I put them back on, neither door would open from the inside. Turns out
that if I over tighten the screw that holds the black plastic &quot;finger guard&quot;
thing under the actual handle, it hits something inside and stops the handle
from opening all the way. Something like that. I just loosened the screw about
a 1/2 turn and it has worked fine ever since. Not sure if this is your
problem, but it is an easy check.
