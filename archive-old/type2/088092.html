Subject: Re: [T2] Question for you'ze guys

&gt; I am wondering that for all the flap about fuel injection, that
&gt; the late 70's Westy's don't seem to do so well on gas. Sure, they have all
&gt; the camping gear, but it's not really so much more in weight and wind
&gt; resistance, is it?

Now you are comparing apples and oranges. Your 1st question asked: &quot; What kind
of highway mileage might one expect to get from a 2L FI engine pushing a
full-dress Westy with pop-top tent?&quot;

You cannot compare this to a '71 T2 &quot;transporter&quot; with no extra equipment.

I don't have a sales brochure for the 71, but I have earlier ones:
The 1968 bus has a vehicle weight of 2723 lbs.
The 1969 bus has a vehicle weight of 2723 lbs.
[this was curb weight, shipping weight was 2634]
The 1970 bus has a vehicle weight of 2811 lbs.
My 77 deluxe Westy curb weight is 3820 lbs. Add my weight and it is 4000 lbs!
[curb weight is the weight of the vehicle in the ready-to-drive state] And
that is not adding for additions like a tent, food, water, other passengers
etc.
That 1000-1200 additional lbs. makes a BIG difference.

Your question should ask &quot;What mileage does a person get with a 76-79 deluxe
Westy being pushed by a 1600?&quot;
