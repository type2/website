Subject: MOFOCO lifters (grumble grumble...)

list,
Against my better judgement and the advice of this list, i ordered something
from MOFOCO. I figured - &quot;what the hell - most of the things i've heard about
were problems with heads or whole engines- how can they screw up reground
lifters?&quot;.

Well, when i talked to the guy at European Motorworks about the reground cam i
ordered, he said to make sure that i use reground lifters with a reground cam
and to make sure they were all the same height.

The difference in size (height between top of radius and skirt) between the
biggest lifter and the smallest lifter MOFOCO sent me as a set is .034&quot; .  My
three other sets of worn stock vw lifters are all within  a few thou of each
other in height.
7 of the lifters they sent me are the std VW lifter with the 'radiused' oil
galley
while one has an angled - more machined looking oil galley.  It is a different
lifter from the others.  Some of them are all dinged up around the top edge.
The parts were dirty and were in an old ziplock bag with holes in it.

I should have listened when i heard you say,

&quot;DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM MOFOCO.&quot;

I will call them today.
