Subject: 68 Bus Nose

Hi All,

Anyone know where I might find a good(decent) nose for a 68 Bus?  A friend is 
not willing to let his 68 go off to the scrap yard and wants to fix damage 
that is likely to be considered totalled.  This has been owned since new and has 
taken his children and grandchildren on trips.  He also needs a passenger and 
sliding door.  Thanks

Ray
