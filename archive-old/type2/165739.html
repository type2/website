Subject: Engine not firing

Hi all,

'71 1600dp, 30/31 brosol carb, 009 dist.

I have had my bus, KK,  out of commission for the past two months
while preparing a new engine for her. The current block cracked up in
Canada and JB Weld held her together while coming home. When I parked
it, it ran great, minus the oil seepage due to the crack.

I went to start her to move it in front of the garage but no luck.
Just turns over. I bypassed the ignition switch to the coil with a
jumper cable as that has caused problems for me in the past. No luck,
and I put a bit of gas into the top of the carb, no go either. Points
are adjusted correctly and timing hasn't changed since parking her.
All the wires are snug and everything looks in place. She cranks
really well, but I am not getting her to fire.

Any suggestions?

Thank you,

Max
