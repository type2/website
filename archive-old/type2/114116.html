Subject: Re: [T2] spam

&gt;&lt;&lt; I'm an IT guy in the industry for +15 years.  I get 100-200 spams per day.
&gt;Heaven forbid should I take a week off.
&gt;The only way to stop spam is to lobby your local representatives to pass
&gt;anti-spam legislation with HEAVY penalties

How about using the freebie Mailwasher. Filters e-mail and bounces a 
&quot;does  not exist&quot; back if the messages don't make it through the filters.

My spam went from a dozen to at most a couple a week.
