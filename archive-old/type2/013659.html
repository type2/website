Howdy there. I picked up this 70 bus intending to fix it up as my 
driver/highway mobile to spell my double cab a bit, but alas at this time 
bills prevent me finishing it.
Bus is in Raleigh, NC, with freshly rebuilt engine, new carb, Bosch 
Distributor &amp; Voltage regulator, good tires, very little rust, especially 
for an East Coast bus. it's a kombi, so it has no interior in the rear, 
which just means you have a blank slate for doing your own interior, or 
throwing in a camper kit. It has some 20 year old Bondo (over dents, not 
rust 
holes) that is starting to peel off, but other than 2 spots, even looks good.
The only thing it really needs is (I think) a headlight switch. The fuses 
are fine, but no sign of low or high beams, or 1 tail light. I'm asking 
$1200, which is very negotiable, as unfortunately I have other financial 
needs that must be dealt with soon. 
This is basically a good solid bus that will go a long way with a little 
more fixin'. For more details, or a more specific list of all the work 
done and needed, please e-mail me. I really need this bus to find a home 
soon.
Thanks,
