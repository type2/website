Subject: homemade instrument cluster

The instrument cluster on my '68 is a mess. Half the
idiot light sockets are pulled out and the other half
don't work. The speedometer doesn't work and the
needle is broken off. dirt, corrosion and a bunch of
wires added by f.o.s for ham radios and godknowswhat.

The salvage dashes I've found are so far are also bad.

Is there an aftermarket solution?
 --or --
I'm thinking about replacing the idiot lights with a
&quot;project box&quot; from Radio Shack in which I put big,
colorful LEDs for oil, gen., high beam, turn flasher.
Then, velcro it on the dash somewhere and ground it
good. Is that too cheesey?
