There's nothing wrong with 1, 2, 3, or whatever shims. Many engines use NO
shims, relying only on good tolerances from the bearing and crank. I have
built many engines, and used to use ONE shim at the correct thickness to
achieve the proper end-play. Just make sure they aren't worn out, they tend
to warp and are difficult to measure their actual thickness like that.
