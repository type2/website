Has anyone use a stitch/spot timer kit on their welder? What does it do? 
Does it make the welding easier? Looks better? I have owned a Lincoln 
100 for 2 years, and yet to master the welding like in the books. I saw 
this as an accessories on the Lincoln and was wondering if it is worth the 
money.

Thanks in Advance
