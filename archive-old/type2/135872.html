&lt;&lt; Yes, the backing plate provides a fulcrum for turning the adjusting

You might not notice it now, but without a decent backing plate and
plugs, the adjusting stars are gonna be rusted solid when it comes
time to adjust the rear shoes. Even with decent plates and plugs, the
stars often become one with the slotted bolt...I've slathered mine with
