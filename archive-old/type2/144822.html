Subject: Info needed on AFM tuning by wideband -- desired AFRs

I've been working on my 78 Bus trying to improve
the fuel economy from ~16 mixed city/highway to the
18-22 it should be. 

I previously tuned the AFM using a borrowed wideband
setup but I'm thinking that I may not have done it
correctly.

I know how to adjust the AFM using the idle screw,
spring and set screw to move the potentiometer arm.

What I'm looking for is what AFR I should be looking
for under different driving conditions:

I figure there is -- 

-Idle
-Deceleration (no throttle)
-Cruise (flat ground, low throttle)
-Slowly accelerating (moderate throttle)
-Wide Open Throttle
-Cold Start

I'm hoping that someone who has wideband tuned their
bus can provide some empirical data. Then I will
borrow the wideband over a weekend and tweak my AFM
until I am close to those.

Thanks much,

Mark
