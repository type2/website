 &gt;Well folks its been a loooong time. but tommorow I plan on getting that =
 &gt;engine in!! I am missing a couple of pieces though I havent been able to =
 &gt;find them online but if anyone has some leads it'd be greatly =
 &gt;appreciated:
 &gt;Piece of shrouding and pipe that connects the passenger side heater box =
 &gt;to the heater control box.
 &gt;The connection for the heater tubes to the heat exchangers from the =
 &gt;fresh fan. (I have the flexible tubing) I need the piece that sits on =
 &gt;top of the heat exchangers and into the fresh air compartment.

...................Hello Tyler........If you are talking about the pieces 
under the chassis, that conduct warmed air between the exchanger and the 
duct with the flow valve in it,(and then into the distribution tubes that 
go on up to the middle and front of the bus) then I suggest that you get 
them bent by a custom muffler/exhaust pipe shop. That is what I did, and I 
used a short sheetmetal screw to anchor each piece after it was in 
place.  I painted each piece with 1,200 degree black paint from Rustoleum 
before installing.  I had the advantage of having a badly rusted model to 
show the pipe-bender, so he easily made up an exact copy. I think that if I 
didn't have a rusty old model, I would try fashioning some kind of tube 
from maybe chicken wire and metal duct tape....the stuff body repair shops 
use to patch big holes in sheetmetal before they lay on the polyester 
resin/bondo stuff. And if I had an old rusty partially eaten-away 
connection tube, I'd try to use the metal duct tape to make it work, since 
replacements are so hard to find. I have also seen flexible metal exhaust 
pipe repair sections that look promising as starting points in fabricating 
such a duct. Another source of such flexible ducting would be a custom 
heating and air conditioning shop. They run sections of flexible metal 
tubing all over buildings to carry the cold air. Just my ideas.....hope 
something works.
