Mike, mai2, et.al., etcetera...

&gt; pry the passenger door  foward at the upper rear
&gt; corner.  

	This is essentially performing the function of a &quot;door jack&quot;, sold with
the pricier unlock kits... it pries the door out enough so that you can
gain access to the inside with another tool... in my case I have several
sections of steel rod that thread together. The manual is very specific
as to its exact use... It is to be used only when other methods have
failed to open the car. People also have a problem with wanting to pry
the edge of the door too far out... which can break windows at that
moment and create door alignment problems immediately or later on.
	I'm not saying that it doesn't work... I'm just saying that taking that
route is riskier than other ways. If you are *very* careful, you won't
cause any damage.
 
&gt; This is easier than
&gt; messing with the vent lock. 

	Some lockout kits come with several pieces that must be inserted near
the vent window... one to depress a lock button and one to turn the lock
arm. I have one tool that is very simple and will do both operations at
once, in a matter of seconds on a good day, with one person needed to
use it. Most vehicle entry professionals will agree that, given the
choice between a vent window tool and the door jack combination, they
would opt for the vent window method, since it is less risky, faster,
and generally easier than the other. 
	You can't very well fabricate one out of a coathanger and expect a
frustration-free unlock. It wants to bend too much... but I've done it
once before when I locked the keys in my truck as I got out to check an
apartment complex parking lot. I just doubled the coathanger wire over
itself to make it stronger. It was still pretty lame, but it worked. 
	The right tool for the job makes all the difference. Try to unlock a
vent window with the wrong tool and you too will deduce that it's a
waste of time.

  I've also reached the sliding door lock
&gt; easily from the louvre windows (were open) even when I had unscrewed the
&gt; front door locking buttons!

That's good, unless you lock the sliding door with a key... My '70
Westy  won't allow the inside lock/handle to unlock the sliding door if
the outside has been locked with a key. I've unlocked a Westy before
with the long sectional rod through the louvered windows and was able to
reach the front lock levers, fortunately.

This is one of those &quot;Feeling up the Elephant&quot; things... think for
yourself and figure out what works best for you, and then do it. 
But before you have to do that... go by the Key Store in the Mall and
have an extra key made to carry in your wallet. It's cheaper than all of
the unlock kits, tools, and professional assistance that you might have
to pay for later on.
