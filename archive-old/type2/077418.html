Richard
isnt the speedo marked in both mph and km? Just looked at my 77 US spec and
its marked in both? Also looked at my 69 and 72 Can spec buses didnt see a
whole lot of dif in the brake warning lights. I know in the reverse
situation when I imported my US spec chev astro to Canada, the only thing I
had to change was to add DRL's. The speedo was already marked in both. If
you've got a knit picker, do what some have sugested and junkyard a light
and speedo.

&gt; Just joined the list...
&gt;
&gt; I moved from Vancouver, BC to Austin, TX a few years ago and I drove my
'78
&gt; Camper the whole way.  When I arrived I found I couldn't register my
vehicle
&gt; because the Canadian model wasn't up to US spec (duh) in 1978.  Since then
&gt; it's largely sat in my driveway and with only 58,000km on the clock it's
&gt; breaking my heart so I've decided to get it &quot;roadworthy&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway after dealing with VW America and US customs I finally determined
&gt; that I need the following done before I can register my bus:
&gt;
&gt; - brake failure warning lamp too small (I guess the red dot with the B on
&gt; the dash)
&gt;
&gt; Sounds ridiculous but I've got the letter to prove it.  Anyone know what I
&gt; can do about this one.  What's the one like on the US '78?  Was it simply
&gt; susposed to spell BRAKE?
&gt;
&gt; - speedo in miles not kilometers
&gt;
&gt; Where are good places to get one of these?  Has any had an experience
&gt; swapping out a speedo?  I mean, what do you do about the odometer reading
&gt; legally?
&gt;
&gt; I would like to get a new canvas for the pop-tent and I'm also looking for
a
&gt; new gas tank because there is too much rust in the old one and clogs the
&gt; fuel line occasionally.  This happened because my father (previous owner),
&gt; let it still with half a tank of gas (no stabilizer) from 1982-1989.
