I am about to start restoring my interior ('78 Westy Champagne Edition - 
formerly the brown Cow Poop Edition - now Tornado red! The red cow poop 
edition would indicate a need for a trip to vet right???) and started 
wondering what everyone else is using for front seats.

Anything has got to be more comfortable than the OEM seats. My butt has 
much more curve than the OEM seat will adjust to. I know I need less butt 
-- but a better seat would help too.

I have a pair of early 90's GTI seats that I think would fit with some 
rework on the mounts.

What do you think?

I don't want to give up the swivel seat on the pass side. New seat, old swivel.

Anyone added a rear facing seat behind the pass side front seat?

I want my van to seat more than just 4 or 5 for short trips.

I have managed to accumulate the rear bed out of an early 70's Westy and 
plan to rebuild it as a seat (always up but with a liftup bottom) but 
narrower - for use between the door and the stove cabinet right behind the 
passenger seat - the hardware and everything should match the back seat 
that way and be seating for 1.5 people - or one very wide person. Yes I 
loose the walk through but the times the seat would actually be in the van 
would be few and not on camping weekends. I am basically looking to 
increase passenger capacity for when I haul the extended family to a family 
gathering (80 miles or so) or a restaurant or whatever - not camping 
weekends (unless I make it very easy to remove for campsite seating).

I don't want to build anything too flimsy, I want something fairly safe - 
no lawn chairs strapped to the floor!!!! &lt;grin&gt;

Did the bay window camper seats that faced backwards survive crashes 
relatively intact or were they a splintered mess?

Inquiring minds want to know...

Thanks all!!!
