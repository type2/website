Subject: Re: window drops, exhaust not stock

Gary McE wrpte:
&gt;&gt;I just bought an '82 GL that I'm trying to get ready for the winter. 
&gt;
Excellent choice ... but then, I may be somewhat biased. &lt;g&gt; 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;2. I have a non stock exhaust hanging off the heater boxes.
&gt;
The crossover pipe which attatches to the heater boxes is obsolete. That may
have something to do with the unusual assembly you have. I am still looking
for a crossover pipe for my '82 GL. Good luck. (I am waiting for the RMMW
catalog to get here, as it is supposed to have some parts that will work ...)

Love, Lotus (Flower of the North)
