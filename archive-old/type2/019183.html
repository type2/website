Hi Friends--

A few weeks ago I posted a question about finding an obscure grommet to
replace a leaky grommet between the brake refill line and the reservoir
that sits on top of the master cylinder (1970). Nobody seems to carry
the part!

For the sake of those who have this leak in the future, I wanted to
report that I finally located the grommet...at my VW dealer down the
street. It cost about $2.50, and it only took a day for them to get it!
