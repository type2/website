Subject: Re: [T2] CA smog: we're boned - Advice needed.-Thanks to all.

This is interesting.  In March my Bus was dyno-ed when it was tested.  I 
remember that.  Between the tester and the mechanic down the road, that 
bus went back and forth a number of times.

It had been idle for 4 years when I bought it so there were afew things 
I missed but it really runs OK.

My wife is really smart and cares abotu me especially as I am partially 
&quot;challenged&quot; and have mobility issues at times. (Only good part of that 
is that I don't need to hunt for parking any more...  &lt;g&gt;)  She wants 
what is best for me and thinks the stress of runing Leisl as a daily 
driver is telling.  She may be right.  But I have a week or so to really 
think out this decison.  Some of your comments are very helpful.

What might help too is if I could show the bus to someone around 
Sacramento who could give me advice and assessment on it's general 
condition.  Might help.

Thanks again,

BEN
