Hey there,

Vw Bus Heaven is a local parts place that might be able to help. They
also do work on buses, so they should be able to give you an estimate
of what the beam replacement will cost (Big $$$).

When the front beam rusts out, it's usually a sign that the bus is at
the end of it's usefulness. Many buses up here in New England are
junked because of this. It may be time to start looking for another
bus (with a good front beam), and use your current bus as a parts
donor.

Hope this helps,
