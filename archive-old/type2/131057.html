Subject: Engine rebuild

Earlier I was asking some questions about an overhaul / rebuild.

Did some thinking and I believe I will go ahead with an overhaul.
My problem is the lack of garage here. I could do it at my parents
but they live 1.5 hours away and Im sure gas money and frantic
need for parts and driving would take it's toll on the pocket book
regardless.

I would save $250 pulling the motor out myself and putting it back
in. That's canadian dollars so Im almost considering letting the shop
do it.  He's a pretty nice guy, and he knows I want a reliable vehicle
for camping with the kids and need good reliable wheels for my travel.
He also knows I want to learn about it so would let me take part in
the process and help, (and hinder) and kick me out of the way
(ie 'go get us some beer') while doing it.

Wednesday I am going to go over and get details on exact penny
to the penny costs.  I am considering redoing the clutch at the same
time and putting a new monza exhaust on it too.

I feel a little disappointed in myself but I think the end result will be ok
with a good vehicle, and I do get to help and learn which I really want
to happen.  Muir's book is pretty good (I have two manuals besides)
and think this may be the best.

Having him rebuild it seems to be a cheaper option than buying a rebuild
too. I know he won't cut corners.

Thoughts? Any other things I should do while it's out?
