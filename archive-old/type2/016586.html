Jaime,

No, no, no...  Rivieras were NOT made by Riviera Motors.  Rivieras were
made by Automotive Services Inc., Camper Division, 2001 West Fourth
Plain Blvd. Vancouver, WA.  They were distributed not only by Riviera
Motors but any number of other VW dealers in the PNW.  (Mine for
example, originally was sold by Valley Volkswagen of Spokane, WA.)

For the definitive story (and an original sales brochure) go to
http://members.tripod_dot_com/~wetwesties/ and follow the Riviera links.

BTW, the scan of the &quot;Warranty and Maintenance of your Riviera Campwagen
Kit&quot; is complete.  I've just got to shrink it down to managable size
(currently 11 meg) and I'll get it on the site too.

Just to set the record straight...

&gt; The reason that alot of people in the U.S. (let alone anywhere else)
&gt; have never seen one, is that they were made in Beaverton, Oregon, by
&gt; Riviera Motors (the local VW retailer) and they were the sole retailer
&gt; for them. This is why they are so common in the Northwest, as well as
&gt; California. They (as well as every other VW dealer in the U.S. at the
&gt; time) could not get enough Westy's to keep up with demand, so they
&gt; made their own version.
