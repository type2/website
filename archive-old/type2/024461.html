Allies,

  Although if I had to guess, there is most likely some info in the archives
on this, I am *not* very computer literate, and after trying a search I really
didn't find anything. So, if there IS a site w/ a procedure on removing and
reinstalling a wiper motor in a '71, please, please forward it to me. Muir's
explanation was brief and didn't cover the problems I ran into.
  Already lost one wiper arm, and the lil' bolt that holds the two halves of
the motor together fell down the front vent openings and is lost forever. My
attempt was to grease the motor back up since it was making a terrible, rusted
sound when I turned it on, and I'd heard this might help...
  Has anyone done this before? Or am I better off just getting a recond. one?
  Any help here is greatly appreciated. We may live in &quot;sunny Calif&quot;, but El
Nino has his way with us these days...
Thanks Again,
Rach &amp; Ramona
