&gt;&gt;the compression is 65, 70, 70, 70 and I'm wondering if I should spend
any

&gt;Make sure the engine is cranking quickly and that all four plugs are
out
&gt;before they start testing.  If it's cranking slow it will give
artificially

It should also be noted that the throttle should be held wide open while
checking compression.  Otherwise the piston will be fighting for
somewhere to suck the air from.
