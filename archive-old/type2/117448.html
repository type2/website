&gt; Okay that sounds like a problem.  I have a fan on the radiator of my
&gt; Mustang that draws 21 amps continuously.  It moves something like
&gt; 2800cfm of air, and if you stand behind it, it's like being in a
&gt; hurricane.  It will straighten your hair, it's so strong.  I would
&gt; check the current draw of those blower motors immediately - if they
&gt; are really drawing 45 amps, there is something seriously wrong.

that's a &quot;MASTER&quot; heat system switch and controls not only the blower
motors, but the heat fuel pump, heat ignition, heat blower, heater
glow/spark plug.  paranoid so I can shut the whole system down with one
flick of switch.

&gt; &gt;???? doesn't seem to be working out that way, how much power does the FI
&gt; &gt;engine draw, with a pertronix in the dizzy????
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't measured it, but I would guess no more than 10 amps.  Fuel
&gt; injectors don't take much current, the ignition takes considerably
&gt; more.

that's what I suspected so

heat system 45A
engine      10A
wipers??     5 amp
lighting??, 16 amp

total       76 amps 
alt        -55 amps

need from battery  21 amps approx ???
