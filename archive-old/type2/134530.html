Subject: [T2] Brake Caliper and Pads

Is hydraulic fluid and brake fluid the same thing? Any harm in using 
commodity hydraulic fluid in the brake system? Also, is it true that brake 
fluid and motor oil are not compatible for recycling purposes?

--------------------

Now that hydraulic fluid is so cheap at the
mass merchandisers, 5 gals for maybe $11, it makes even more sense to me....
YMMV
