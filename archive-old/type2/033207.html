Dear List Members,

There was a small glitch in that a special tape that was supposed to go
in the box got left out. The result was a fun meeting with Chris
Slaymaker from Knoxville to get the tape (which features music about
being on the road and a neat photo of Chris and Lurch) so all is well in
hubcapdom and we now have some super cool music to accompany the baton!
(move over fanfare for the common man!) More when we do the next
handoff!

Chris and Gus the (now) musically inclined Bus
