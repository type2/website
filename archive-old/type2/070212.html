Rusty,
        You will have to have your '67 smogged yearly.  Interesting that 
the people in California are tested only every other year.  Their old cars 
are allowed over twice the emmissions that your '67 will be in AZ.  What 
I find a hassle in Airizona ( I also have a '67 in Tucson) is that the 
EPA does not require cars built before 1968 to be smogged to be allowed 
into the US.   I find it strange that the government hating government of 
AZ allows their own clean air people to be so fussy.  Gary Gibson
