Subject: parts, long

My wife and I just bought our first house.  The only problem is:
it's half the size of the one we've been renting for the past 8
years and
it does not have a garage, so I need to get rid of some stuff.

VDO oil pressure sender.  This is the single pole, no idiot light
hook up model.  10 yrs old, but never used.  FREE + shipping.

73- 2 headlight buckets with the chrome trim, no rust.  Even has
the wiring harness and plug intact.  FREE + shipping.

73(I think)- 2 front turn signal housings, lenses and wires.  One
lens is slightly cracked, but in great shape.  These are the
squareish
front turn signals that are mounted above the headlights.  FREE +
shipping.

73- center isle black mat.  Good shape, could use a good
cleaning.  FREE + shipping.

?- 2 front seat belts, No hardware or female buckle.  The male
part of the buckle is square. FREE + shipping.

?- 2 front seat belts, All hardware plus the female buckle.  The
male part of the buckle is round.  FREE + shipping.

73westy fold out bed brackets.  Nothing else, just the folding
brackets.  FREE + shipping.

73- windshield washer tank.  seems to be in excellent condition.
FREE + Shipping.

73westy- coat closet door w/ mirror and the rear storage
compartment door.  No handles.  FREE + shipping.

Stock carbs complete setup.  Manifolds, linkage, air cleaner,
32-34 PDSIT-2 and 32-34 PDSIT-3 carbs, the whole show.  These
came
off a 73 or 74.  I used them on my 72 (which had a 1700cc engine
at the time).  They ran OK, but my engine had many other problems

at the time so I can't say for sure if my problem was the carbs.
I rebuilt them, but always felt they needed to have new bushings
installed.  I had them on my 72 to be smog legal so some or all
of the original smog stuff may be missing or incapacitated, as
the 72
only required stock carbs and distributor to be legal.
California  no longer requires the 72 to be smog certified and
since I have no room
for it, it has to go.  I'd like to get a little something for
this (Like maybe enough for a burger and a six pack) as I paid
$200.00 for it.

73- 1 wiper arm assembly w/motor.  Appears to be in great
condition.  I don't know if the motor works, but could test
before
shipping.  FREE + shipping.

If you've read this far then this might be the item for you.  1
rear bug screen.  Excellent condition for being so old, kind of
dirty from
age, but could be cleaned up.  Possibly never used,  nicely
folded.  FREE + shipping.

As I don't really know a good fair way to go about this I will do
what benefits me.  All items will be first come first served,
However,
if someone want's to donate to the garage building fund (my first
project at our new house) I will consider sending the item to
that
person.
I start moving on Tuesday so please don't hesitate, I have to get
rid of this stuff, one way or another.
