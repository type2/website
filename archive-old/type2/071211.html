Subject: Everybus caravan East TN
To: type2-digest_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

DocRic mentioned a few weeks ago setting up a rendezvous near the TN-NC 
border for those traveling from Tennessee to North Carolina for Everybus.  
I've not heard anything new (at least on the list) regarding this soooooo . . 
. .

I would like to pose the question again.  Any takers?  I'll probably drive up 
to Roan Mountain Thursday night and I suspect the caravan will commence about 
mid-morning Friday (does that sound right, Ric?).

I know we have listmembers in Cookeville, Knoxville, Elizabethton, Johnson 
City, Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, etc., etc., etc.  P-mail &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://nurofiz_at_aol_dot_com&quot;&gt;me&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://docric_at_preferred_dot_com&quot;&gt;
Ric&lt;/A&gt; with a reply, yay or nay.

We can certainly pick up NC people along the way.  We'll be traveling through 
Blowing Rock (by way of the Blue Ridge Parkway), then highway 421 through 
Wilkesboro and Winston-Salem.  Leave us a number where you can be reached and 
we'll call you when we are in the vicinity.

&quot; . . . at least I'm enjoying the ride&quot;
