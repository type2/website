&gt;I don't think that's the case, Bob.  Unless you're messin' with
&gt;something other than the idle mixture adjustment, it shouldn't make any
&gt;difference, because the EGR valve is closed at idle.

	I was tempted to reply that it didn't matter, the EGR would
be returning only inert gas, no oxygen, so no leaning-out, but I
realized my last smog-check would give actual 02 measurements
and SURPRISE (for a stock '70 1600sp w/ 31PICT carb: ( reading/allowed)

		Idle		'speed'
RPM		1051		2604
HC PPM		195/700ppm	26ppm
CO%		4.82/6.00%	0.17%
CO2%		11.9%		15.2%
O2%		11.0%		5.4%

	So the amount of O2 in exhaust gas with the engine runnning at
speed is significant- remember O2 is only 21% of regular air, and the
fuel mixed with air only burns with that 21% of oxygen... if our '70
had an EGR, the EGR would add 5.6% X (egr volume/carb volume) more
O2- certainly WOULD lean it out. Which is the point I guess.

	Anyway, Giff's right, the EGR SHOULD be closed at idle. Might
be a good ideal to test that it is closed BEFORE adjusting mixture. 
Disconnect the control hose from EGR to manifold and plugging the manifold 
end- that should cause the EGR to open (no vaccum) and engine RPM to drop
because of both dilution and leaning out. Don't run it for a long time
that way though!
