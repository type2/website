Subject: Re: [T2] draining tranny fluid (auto tranny)

&gt; My tranny fluid waas a little low and I added some, but I think I added to 
&gt; much. How do I drain a little fluid on an auto tranny? Also, was I supposed 
&gt; to fill it in the same place I checked the level?

put a pan under the fill tube, loosen the nut that holds the fill tube
into the side of the tranny sump,  wiggle the tube and let it drip out.

yes check and fill on a level surface if possible
