&gt;There is a diagram in the 68-79 Bentley book of the proper pushrod 
&gt;dimension. I apologise for the long post, but I just want you folks to know 
&gt;to check that pushrod first before you pay some pseudo experts to have their 
&gt;way with your bus.

I must suggest the pseudo expert was the one who last installed the pushrod
without checking it, or adjusted it wrong. Brake lock up is caused most by
unmaintained calipers, then by unmaintained hoses, then by unmaintained
master cylinders, with a number of improper procedures thrown in, like lack
of proper adjustment spec., like simple maintenance procedure, flushing and
renewel of fluid periodically, rather than waiting for a problem, repair
and bleeding only with some mis-diagnosis thrown in for good measure.

When brakes are not releasing, I don't look at the pushrod adjustment
first, I exercise the calipers and flush the fluid. Always scrutinize the
hoses closely for evidence of bulges, but know that if chunks of gook come
out with the fluid, they are contaminated and should be replaced cause if
they aren't restricting flow now they soon will be as the new fluid begins
to disolve the crud.

If that all looks descent and checks out, then I will focus on the master
cylinder and get to the rod if no problems with the mc. 

If I do see gook in the fluid and have sticky calipers or swollen hoses,
long before I get to any push rod adjustment I will inform you that the
cause of the problem is contamination of the system.

When the fluid reservoir is contaminated the whole system is contaminated.
When the master cylinder is contaminated the whole system is contaminated.
When a caliper is contaminated the whole system is contaminated.
Contamination is the culprit when brake lockup is concerned over 99% of the
time. If that's not it, then it will be found to be someting really strange
and anomalous like a turkey neck who put in the wrong or non-spec master
cylinder and/or didn't check the rod length. 

Every mechanic I ever met was human, and they try to focus on the highest
probable result with the evidence given, at least the most ethical ones do.
What they did was the shortest route to the resolution of this symptom in
the vast majority of cases. But frankly, if the pedal had no slack, it is
easily felt and should be recognized as none spec. It should have been
addressed as well as any other non-spec issues like contamination, which,
as I said before, is non-spec, and the source of bad brakes and breaks.
