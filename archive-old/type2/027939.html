Subject: Need Carb setup for '77: FI doggin' me
Message-ID: &lt;FDKHMFLMHCBGCAAA_at_theglobe_dot_com&gt;

Well,

I'm ready to throw in the towel on this fuel injection. Bottom line: I need a vehicle and I'm stuck messing with this FI, so I don't have one. I've tried spare brain, spare AFM, spare fuel pump, etc, etc.

I guess I need a carb, a manifold, and a fuel pump. Anything else? Anyone with GOOD spares they don't mind parting with, please let me know. OR even better, anyone with recommendations on where to get a new carb and fuel pump reasonable...and matching manifolds, used or new, please let me know. I'm open to suggestions on the best combinations too.

I can trade FI parts, including some that I can guarantee.

I gave it a good try guys, but I'm out of ideas and can't trust the locals to do the work without gouging me bigtime.

If I can't recover from this soon, I'm gonna have to buy a car from a dealership...which will mean I've got payments and can't afford my bus anymore.

Thanks! Joe
