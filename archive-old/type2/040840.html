Subject: GL4 found!

Volks,

I found some GL4 1 block from my house. At of all places, NAPA.
It is made by a company called STA-LUBE. They had 2 gallons. I bought both
of them. Anyway, Sta-Lube is out of Warminster Pa. 18974
Parent company is CRC industries Inc.

Their phone numbers are:

Tech: 800-521-3168
Cust Serv.: 800-272-8963

Anyway, try NAPA first.

Good Luck,

Matt
