&gt; Seriously - I totally agree. Drove a friend's '78 Riviera to Crossville
one day (35 miles at 65mph+). Has Cooper car tires. Scared me to death
with all it's weaving and wandering from tires that were #1 - underated,
and #2 - under pressure (van had been stored and I failed to up the
pressure to max pressure which was still under capacity for the vehicle.


I have to agree.  Way back before I knew better (it's in the archives) I
ran standard load tires on my bus.  Everything went swimmingly until I had
two tread separations (both rear wheels) within 100 miles on a road trip,
on half-worn-out tires.

Learned my lesson, switched to 185R14 load range D, and carry two spares
on road trips.  Nary a problem after that!
