Subject: piston thump against the case

Whenever I have an engine on a test stand with the pistons off and the rods
in a horizontal position, I worry about the rods clanking against the rims
of the cylinder cutouts in the case. I don't want to indent that area and
worry about a leak.

I have tried jamming pieces of swimming pool hose onto each rod as I remove
a piston. This hose thumps harmlessly against the cutout and all is well.
Except when I rotate the crank to do this or that, a hose will hit the
crank and prevent further rotation.

I would like to come up with a better way.

Ideally, it seems that I would find a plastic coffee can lid with just the
right diameter, cut out all but the very edge,  and wedge this edge into
the opening in the case. Then no matter what the orientation of the case,
the rods would hit this and not metal.  Alas, coffee cans don't seem to
follow vw metric design rules.

Does anyone have a clever approach?

Jack
