Subject: Re: [T2] Seat Restoration 

Dan,

I have actually had fair luck fixing these with a short piece of steel 
tubing and jb weld if it is the actual spring itself.  I think you 
probably understand the procedure.

I figured that actually welding it would make it weak at that point and it 
was best to just &quot;splint&quot; it....I think I had a short piece of steel brake 
line that worked well...surely it was steel...

I fixed one like this in my champagne edition and as far as I know, it is 
still in good shape!

If it is the spring connection along the perimeter, then your imagination 
is everything!&lt;grin&gt;



Cheers, dave

&gt; George, or anyone else, if I have a broken perimeter
&gt; spring in the seat is there any particular advice about
&gt; welding it?  It is, of course, thin and it is spring
&gt; steel, so I am emboldened to ask.  I do not have a
&gt; spot welder, so it will be MIG or stick if at all.
  (This is a flat metal strip around the outside of
  the actual springs; hope this makes sense to anyone
  who has replaced padding.)
&gt;
&gt; As it is, the broken end has penetrated the seat and
&gt; I'm on a pillow to get above it.
