Subject: Re: [T2] Cutting brake/hand brake

Yeah the dunebuggies do this and farmers do this with their tractors. They are called turning brakes. 

Are you getting stuck often?

The Beetle crowd has a special pair of handles that replaces the stock single brake handle allowing the driver to pull the left or right cable. That slows or stops the wheel on one side sending the torque to the other side. 

Of course if a wheel is spining wildly and the other is not and suddenly the spinning wheel catches traction, you stand a chance of blowing the differential up. Not likely if you are careful and keep the spinning tire slow. 

Also the Beetle method completely replaces the handbrake and looses the option to lock the brake in the on position for sitting on hills. 

Is your friend still able to use his stock parking brake? 

In theory you could add two handles that pivot below the cables and have a lump (tang) welded to the side of the lever closest to the cable. As you pull the lever back, it would lift the cable and tighten the brake shoes on one side. 

The framing of the lever mounts and how you keep the handles from rattling would be up to you. 

Another option would be to add a pair of floor brake handles as found on my CR-V. Add a rotor to the inside CV joints and a small caliper (motorcycle?). Caliper mount would bolt to the tranny. You could accomplish the same thing in a more elegant way. 

Caliper could actuate via the cable method or hydraulically. You add the levers in the cab ANYWHERE you want if they are hydraulic. 

Easiest method (well no cutting anyhow) would be the least intrusive: mechanical calipers, rotors on inside CV joint, and the calipers are actuated by vaccum! Could be done with a valve in the cab for left and right side, by kinking or pinching a hose in the cab, or simply by actuating a monentary switch in the cab that closes a vaccum valve somewhere else (found on Hyundais I know of). Vaccum actuators are a junkyard item. I am thinking of the autostick clutch but cruise controls pro have a good strong actuator...
