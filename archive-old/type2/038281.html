Subject: Re: CV joints

&gt;Several years ago, I returned a &quot;questionable&quot; CV to service because of a
&gt;lack of funds.  It's still doing its job.  With this piece of data, I've
&gt;come to the conclusion that it's impossible to predict the future life of
&gt;a CV.  If it's not making noise, I don't replace it!

Exactly what I meant in my reply, like George says, even questionable
CV's last forever.  I'll qualify a bit more from experience, I was actually
being a bit conservative for Pat's sake in my opinion.  I've run CV's that
would make the &quot;bad&quot; comparison pictures in Haynes look like jokes.
I've done em reversed for direction, and I've got 50k+ out of them beyond
that time before I finally broke down and replaced them.  I also mic balls
and swap out parts, as I have a box of about 20 old CV's.  You got to
be carefull on that though as although there are 3 grossly different ball
sizes in Bus CV's from '68-'92 there are some subltly diffferent tolerance
sizes as well.  Generally I go for a nice mid tight joint mixing parts and
I know it will be OK, using a matched set of balls.  I have a friend who
runs a honest 150hp rail and he's been doing this for years and got me
started.  He typically breaks cages instead of wearing races and I get
his spares.

I only really trash a CV when 2-3 adjacent grooves on one race are really
galled or 2 on one and the other race is galled in 1-2 places as well.

Bus CV's wear bizzarly, depending entirely on lot and year, Dr. Tim 
suggested 300k out of a CV, well for a Type2 unit, I've never seen it, even
when maintained beautifully.  Conversely I've had lots of FWD VW CV's
over 200k looking brand new.  Even maintaining anally I've never gotten
more than 125k out of a Bus CV before it began to look like most people
would be worried about, then I start my swapping and reversing and run
it another 100k, but again, that is me.  The bus units are a crap shoot, if
you get one where the inner, outer race and the balls are all miraculously
similar hardness, it will last forever, but in my experience, one race, the
inner usually is soft, and it will go first.  As I've said before some years
of production seem better than others, the small ball pre '71 joints don't
seem to ever be good, but are the oldest, out of like mile cars, I've seen
good luck from '74-'75, '78-'79, '83-'84 and '89-'90 ish productions when I've
taken apart a set of axles with say 90kish original miles, and assumed
no prior service.  The other years, particularly early aircooled vanagon and
'76-'77 bus I've seen go badly.  But there were probably 2-3 OEMs for VW
over those years, and even Lobro changed manufacturing processes and
configurations year to year or lot to lot it seems.

&gt;You need to replace it.  Be sure that the snap ring groove is clean and
&gt;square.  It helps to machine a small groove in the ends of the snap ring
&gt;with a small carbide cutter in a Dremel (perhaps a file will work) to make
&gt;installation of the snap ring easier.  Otherwise, it'll slip off of your
&gt;snap ring pliars and fly to the farthest corner of your garage.

That is a damn good idea that had never occured to me.  Although I also
note Sears sells a very nice set of snapring pliers for about $25 that gets
em every time.  They used to be nicer actually but they changed their
supplier, still of sufficient quality.  Also from a purely guessing
standpoint,
you likely don't &quot;need&quot; the clip actually.  Sandrail friends used to run Bug
shafts I guess that were too short without the clips letting them float.
Once it is in there, no where for the shaft or CV to go.  I'm not saying
to delete them, and they come new in every good set, but if you loose it
and it's youre only car, don't sweat it.

Again CV's are a matter of personal opinion, if you carry a spare you can
afford to run crap, you might have to change it when you really don't want
to, but you won't be stuck.  You need a greased spare, a boot, your snap
ring pliers, a good 2-3 arm puller, and a hammer to do it on the road, and
your appropriate 6mm bolt key (triple square or hex depending on what's on
there.)  I always carry the tools, so the joint is trivial to have.

One last thing, if it is a damn POS Vanagon, consider the new, getting to
those outboards is such a PITA even I don't like to put junk back in there.
