Subject: VW Wheel Balance Adapter - $50

You say:
&quot;This adapter bolts to your wide five VW rime with the same lug nuts that
hold the wheel to the car so you can finally get theose wheels balanced.

Available for either 12mm or 14mm lugs. &quot;

It's not clear to me how this solves the problem.

One bolts a tire onto this plate and then this plate gets attached to the
balance machine? Is it for sure that the plate will fit most machines?

Also, what is the diameter of the center hole, the diameter and weight of
the plate itself, and what is the bolt pattern for the 12mm and 14mm holes?

Thanks....
