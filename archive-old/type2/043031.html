Subject: Tightening the Wind Wings

Greetings -

Just a quick note to share how I tightened the flapping action on Itch's
wind wings, which wouldn't stay fully open at 60mph with the gusts of trucks
going the other way.

Ingredients:

1 vice-grip
1 ball bearing - &gt;= OD at the knurled end of the rivet on the top wind wing
hinge.

Recipe:

Place ball bearing on the bottom (knurled end) of the rivet. Tighten
vice-grip. Re-tighten vice-grip. Once more. Let simmer with vice-grip
clamped for 1 minute (adjust for elevation). Do not twist vice-grip!

Remove vice-grip and ball bearing. Repeat on other wind wing. Those with
rear wind wings, repeat again and again.

There you have it. It's easier than I make it sound.
