Hello all,

Once again I'm back on the list after over six months of bus bliss and
grad school hell. Grad school is coming to an end and the bus has
decided to throw a fit.

As I came up to a stop light (on a busy road) last week the bus died.
Luckily the light was red giving me time to try to get it started.  When
the light turned green and I was still frantically trying to get my baby
running, I jumped out and pushed it off to the side of the road.

What ensued was hours of road side troubleshooting.

First, my fuel gauge doesn't work so I took off the gas cap shook the
bus and listened (crude but it was all I could think of) to make sure I
had fuel. I could hear it sloshing around in there so I figured I had
gas.  A few days prior, I had trouble getting the bus started after I
shut it off (warm). It was raining hard at the time and I don't know if
this had anything to do with it but I finally got it started.

This time however I was not so lucky. After a half an hour of thinking
and cranking the starter, I decided to go get some gas and make sure
there was plenty of gas in it. I put in a gallon (largest can I could
buy) and it fired momentarily and died!! Now I thought maybe I had
actually run out of gas. I went back and got another gallon of gas, put
it in and tried again several times. Finally it started and I drove
about one block and it died instantly again. Another push, waited a few
minutes and it started. Another block and it died. Finally I sat at this
spot for a long time, thinking about my options. At this point it
refused to start again. I cranked and cranked, checked to make sure I
was getting fire to the plugs etc. A friend that had come to my
rescue/assistance said I may have damaged the fuel pump or the filter
could be clogged. I got under the bus wiggled the two wires connected to
the fuel pump and tapped on the filter. Got in the bus after this and it
started right up. I let it idle for about 15-20 minutes and it cut out
twice but didn't die. I drove all the way home (around 2 miles) with no
problems.

I ordered a fuel filter (bus boys) the next day and am still waiting for
it.

I have it home now but when I went out yesterday (one week later) and
tried to start it, I had no luck. I also smelled a fairly strong gas
smell possibly due to the fact that there was no firing. Today I got it
to start but it would die suddenly after about 2 minutes. I did this
twice and then gave up in frustration.

I looked all through the archives and found so many possibilities I
don't know where to start. HELP PLEASE!  Any advice will be greatly
appreciated.
