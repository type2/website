Subject: smog and gasoline in CA

Since I moved I don't seem to be getting very good mileage out of my bus despite the amount of highway driving each day.

On the way to work today I passed a gas station that was advertising that they don't put MTBE in their gas.  It seems that MTBE is beingg phased out but was given a year extension recently:

I searched the web for more info and came across this home page on smog testing which got me thinking:

http://home.att_dot_net/~Lemon.J.Russell/poorgas.htm

- Is there a season that's best for passing your smog test or is the same gas used all year long in CA?

- For an FI bus that doesn't have the L-jet lambda sensor is the bus running too lean on the current gas formulation?
