Subject: Re: [T2] Web site space for buses? Plus - 

Sorry if this is a repost - I didn't see it posted...


I host most of my websites at pair_dot_com.

BTW, There is a bus in town I am considering - it's kind of orange,
however. It's a Westfalia, 1980, but without the propane set-up, has an
icebox. Owned by a VW mechanic for years.

I'm having a hard time getting over the orange and the lack of propane -
how easy would it be to paint it so that it looks good? It does have some
rust bubbleing under two windows.

I guess a camp stove is the fix for the stove...

I have the opp. to look at a 1986 which is $9,000. I guess it
it has the newer engine.

...and a 1985 for $7,000, with the &quot;straight-up&quot; poptop?

Thanks,

Andree
