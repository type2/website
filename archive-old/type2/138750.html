&gt; Got it back from the shop a week ago.  Engine was rebuilt and running
&gt; strong.  Automatic tranny shifting real smooth.
&gt;
&gt; I've got a problem that's getting worse.
&gt;
&gt; Originally, it would stall intermittingly at traffic lights and stop
&gt; signs, if I kept it in drive.  If I shifted into neutral, it kept running.
&gt; Most of the time, it was fine.  I figured it was water in the gas or
&gt; something that would work itself out with time.  I put in a bottle of &quot;dry
&gt; gas&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; But instead of getting better, it got worse.
&gt;
&gt; Then it started to stall at almost all stops.  Putting it in neutral
&gt; didn't always save it.  Most of the time it would start right back up, but
&gt; not always, which made for some interesting traffic patterns...if I waited
&gt; a minute or two, it would start back up.
&gt;
&gt; Today it started stalling while coasting at speeds lower than 25 mph.  I'm
&gt; scared to drive it anywhere....
&gt;
&gt; I swapped out the fuel filter, thinking it might be a clogged fuel filter.
&gt; The vehicle did sit for a year while I was working on it.  It's got a
&gt; brand new fuel pump.
&gt;
&gt; I tightened up the alternator belt.  That seemed to help, for a while.
&gt;
&gt; I thought it might be a vacuum leak, but I'll be damned if I can find one.
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?   I've put so much time and money and blood into this
&gt; thing...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your time.
&gt;

My first question is, did you drain all the year old fuel when you changed
the filter? I just changed the hoses and filter on my 80 Westy after it had
sat for about a year. I drained all the fuel into a clean gas can intending
to put it back into the tank when finished. I happened to look in the can
before returning the gas to the tank and the color of the fuel caught my
eye! It looked way too dark, like the 2cycle mixture I put in my snow
blower. Compared it to some fresh gas I syphoned from my 75. No comparison!
It didn't even smell like the fresh gas, more like kerosene maybe. I guess I
have 2 1/2 gals of solvent for cleaning parts as long as I'm carefull.

When it comes to vacuum leaks I like to take a vacuum reading before I
change anything. then I take some rubber stoppers of various sizes and
little plugs and remove ALL vacuum hoses from their sources ov vacuum and
cork the sources. I then take a new vacuum reading. If I now have a higher
reading I know from the start I have a vacuum leak. I then replace the hoses
ONE AT A TIME. Taking a reading after each hose is replaced. If and when the
vacuum reading decreaces I blame the hose I just replaced and install new
hose. I find this safer and cleaner than using flamable things like carb
cleaner, propane, etc. to find a leak. Plus the vacuum guage method will
I.d. a hose that has become porous with age as well as a cracked hose.

Hope this helps solve your suicidal tendancies, and your bus troubles. :)
