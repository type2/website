Subject: [T2] 81 Westy interior, NW Oregon

Hello,

I went to the u-pull it wrecking yard between Tigard &amp; Sherwood today and
&quot;didn't&quot; find anything for my bus but I did see a '81 westy that still had
all the westy cabinets including the sink/stove/fridge one &amp; all in good
shape.  Definately worth a trip or phone call if you're looking

Good Luck,

David Dalbey
'70 Westy
