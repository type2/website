Subject: [T2] questions on new 2L

My new engine arrived this morning for the vanagon and I have a couple of
questions on assembly.

Are there gaskets used on the spacer blocks for the intake runners? There
was not any on the original engine or in the gasket kit, but Wilson calls
for them.

The engine has two left heads, i.e. both have the socket for the heat
sensor. What is the proper thing to use to fill the hole on the right side
and to secure the tin?

TIA

Bill
