 Saw one in Sears with nice rounded corners, plastic body. .Would easily
fit into the space the screen opens in the late Westy Roof tents.  Heard of
someone putting one up there when camped.
I thought of building a covered one into the roof rack and having it slide
backwards on drawer glides to fit into the screen opening when you had the
top up!   I imagine you could build it into the rear window area (take out
the back door window).   Hmmmm there's a thought- I already can carry a
14000 watt generator back there on a shelf over the bumper!
