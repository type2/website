        Hi, I'm currently restoring my '69 camper.  I have almost all of
the windows &amp; seals out, plus all the inside, etc, etc.  My question is: I
have rust on some of the window frames, some on the floor, and a few other
places.  I bought a sandblaster- never used one before- watchout! but
anyway I plan on sandblasting the rust.  I have some por-15, would that be
a good thing to put on the sandblasted metal?  I remember someone saying
that they painted a rusted area w/por 15 &amp; it stopped the spread of rust,
but not the rust?  Hmmm.  I'm just wondering if the por-15 would be a good
or bad thing.  Also, if it's not a good idea to use that what kind of
preperation &amp; primer should I use on the metal?  I want this bus to last &amp;
not rust out.  I live in MN, but it WON'T be driven in the winter or when
salt is on the roads.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated, and if any
of you have any other tips, things I should/shoundn't do, etc. send 'em my
way.

Thanks in advance,
Keri
