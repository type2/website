Subject: Reminder:  ICABOD Camp Out

Hello Volks,

I wanted to remind everyone about the First Annual ICABOD (Iowa City 
Area Bug/Bus Occursion in the Dale ) Camp out held in the Valley of the 
Cedar River - Palisades-Kepler State Park in Linn County, Iowa August 
17th-19th.  Come out to camp out in a beautiful park located on the 
Cedar River just outside Mt. Vernon/Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

http://www.iowadnr_dot_com/parks/state_park_list/palisades.html

Reservations should be made online at the website above.  Follow the 
link then click on &quot;Park Reservation System&quot; to reserve your spot.   
Modern shower and restroom facilities are available, as well as a dump 
station.

There are both dock and trail activities available.  A dock to the Cedar 
River is available for boating and fishing is available on the river 
banks.  Trails include a variety of wildlife, scenic views, and 
exploration of Indian Mounds.

Directions:

Feel free to google/mapquest this address.  It is in the correct location

700 Kepler Dr
Mt Vernon, IA 52314

Basic Directions from I-80:  Take Exit 246 and head North on Highway 1 
for 25 miles.  At the intersection of Highway 1 and Highway 30, head 
West 3.5 miles.  Turn onto Kepler Drive and into the park.  The entrance 
of the park is in a grove of trees and is difficult to see.  However, 
that grove of trees is the only cluster of trees on the highway.

Feel free to respond to me with any questions or clarification requests.
