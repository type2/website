Hi,

 Dave writes:

&gt;     In my 77 2000  fi, on the passenger side of the firewall, there is a
&gt; silver box.  It is not the double relay.  The wires for it seem to come
&gt; from the alternator.
&gt;
&gt;     Help me out and tell me what it is, a bit of what it does, and
&gt;  perhaps why the brown wire coming from it is burned.

 That'd be your voltage regulator, though on my '77 it's on the driver's
side... :-)

 It's job is to stop the output (voltage) of your alternator getting too
high and boiling your battery. Too high is more than 14.5 Volts or so.
 I don't know offhand which wire the brown one is, but it seems likely that
either it's short circuited (insulation worn through?) or that it is 
carrying execssive current because extra gizmos have been added to
the wiring attached to it, without being able to recall what it's role
is I can't guess how likely the latter is.

Cheers,
	 W.
