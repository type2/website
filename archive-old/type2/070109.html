Subject: Starting when warm

&gt;Subject: Re: hard starting when warm('71 westy)
&gt;

&gt;&gt; I had to put another engine in her for now to get her moving, and I 
&gt;&gt;can't quite seem to iron all of the bugs. The major problem would be
&gt;&gt;this: I go to start up in the morning and all is well, half a crank
&gt;&gt;on the key and it fires up and idles smoothly, but after running for
&gt;&gt;a while and warming up, she won't start. If I let it sit for a while, 
&gt;&gt;then she'll fire up okay, but not immediately. The engine in question
&gt;&gt;is a 1500cc with a 30pict3 carb and a mechanical type distributor. (I 
&gt;&gt;plugged up the vacuum hoses from the carb. Hopefully well enough) I 
&gt;&gt;checked the valve adjustment this morning before running as when she 
&gt;&gt;gets warmed the engine tends to miss some but all seems good there. 
&gt;&gt;.006 all around. Also, the choke seems to be functioning properly. 
&gt;&gt;Those were my two best guesses. Any sugestions?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks again,
&gt;&gt;Matt

&gt;  Matt, for one thing, they all have that to some degree if real
&gt; hot. It is conjectured that fuel in the carby and even in the line 
&gt; vaporizes giving a kind of vapor lock. I'm not so certain on that
&gt; one but I have found that the timing can be the cuplrit. It's just 
&gt; a minute difference between what starts good cold and won't start
&gt; hot. Try retarding the spark a degree or two.          west

The Haynes book talks about warm start techniques for the '71.  Open the
throttle to full.

Eug,
