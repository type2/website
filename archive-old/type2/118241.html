Subject: intake air sensor in FI engine

I've been fighting the same sort of surge problem that has been the 
subject of a long-running thread.

I'm systematically working my way through the FI components, and 
noticed a peculiarity of the intake air sensor that I have not seed 
discussed in the archives.

I connected an ohmmeter between terminals 7 and 8 and tracked the 
resistance as I swept the flap through its range. Bentley says to 
expect a range of values  100 - 500 ohms.

 From this spec and from looking at the circuit diagram, I expected 
the resistance to vary linearly between those values. Instead, it 
increased from 180 ohms at flap fully closed to a peak of 600 ohms 
and then decreased to 180 ohm at flap fully open.

While scratching my head, I looked carefully at the printed circuit 
board that is inside the sensor.  It looks to me as though this is 
not  simple potentiometer but rather a carbon resistor with a set of 
taps coming off of it. Each of these connects to a pad and then 
disappears into the circuit.  Depending on the type of circuit in 
there, the resistance might not be a simple linear function of wiper 
position and could even give the numbers I observed.  On the other 
hand, my sensor might be messed up.

After perhaps boring you with this way-too-long description, my 
question is: has anyone tracked the resistance versus wiper position? 
Was it linear or did it change the way mine did?

'Thanks for any help here.  I'd hate to invest in one of these 
expensive parts if I don't have to.
