Subject: spare tire
Mime-Version: 1.0

i was recently browsing through the archives on the subject matter of the 
spare tire mount on the front of the bus.

does anyone have pictures of what a spare tire mount looks like when 
attached to the bumper?  i just recently bought a replacement for the 
missing mount for my '75 westy.  there are plenty of holes in the sheet 
metal w/ gaskets where the mount once existed (that have been painted 
over...but let's not get into that one.)

i was considering using the new mount, but just placing it lower, so most 
of the weight of the spare would be on the bumper and not the sheet 
metal.  then i could put the front emblem back where it belongs.

how does this look?  is it safe?  will the bolts shear through the 
metal?  can i put some reinforcing on the &quot;inside&quot; metal of the bus?  what 
is the average air speed velocity of a swallow?

thanks volks
