My '72 Westy currently has a really cool custom wooden floor that looks like
it belongs in a living room or something, i am considering putting carpet on
the floor, but i live in NY and theres tons of mud and snow and crap all over
the place and was wondering what people thought, its not too big of a deal to
clean the wood floor once and  a when it gets caked with mud, but i'm thinking
carpet will be a huge pain.  any thoughts, insults, bomb threats?

Thanks,
Tripps
