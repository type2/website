Subject: AIRS Update &amp; A Pressing Tune-Up Matter

Per recent threads, I got my 009 working well in my T4 engine by timing it 
at 3000 RPM to 32 BTDC. Then it falls to about 10 BTDC at idle.

John

&gt; 1) Can the 009 be tuned well enough to work on a carburated 1978 
&gt; w/webers -
enough to get them 3k miles, or is it a futile effort?

&gt; Please send me some words of wisdom...
