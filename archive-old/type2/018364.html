The server bounced this for&quot;excessive quoted material&quot; so now I gotta stretch Friday...

Karl, my mistake... To elaborate;

VW owners seem to be a bit (how shall I say this...) different.  By
&quot;platforms&quot; I meant, What type of computer are you sitting in front of? (Or do
you usually sit in front of.)  Mac? Wintel box? MicroVAX? IBM System 30?
ENIAC? Cray? etc.

Send 'em on to me, and we'll find out what our other vehicle is.

&gt; &gt;Okay, I just completed a survey of the platforms used by Vanagon owners on
&gt; &gt;the
&gt; &gt;vanagon_at_gerry list.  Now it's the Type2 listmember's turn.  So...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Send me (mailto:jrasite_at_eoni_dot_com, not the list!) the platforms you use.
&gt; &gt;I'll
&gt; &gt;collate and report back next Friday.
