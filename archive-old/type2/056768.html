Subject: Re: Safety and Lock Rear Hatch!!!!

After all this discussion of safety and rear latches, I decided to go 
down and look at the inside handle on my V*lv* hatch. It's a t-bar that 
pivots and pulls the latch mechanism to open -- just what one might have 
of the inside of a transporter. *But*, there's a little turnscrew that's 
exposed only when the hatch is open. One way, it lets the t-bar pivot; 
the other way, no pivot. In theory it could be adapted to fit and work on 
the type 2 hatch. But in practice -- what a lot of work! Forget it. I'm 
just going to stick a sign in the rear: no drunks or children allowed. Or 
fools.
