Subject: RE: poptop seal

&gt; Ok list today I got the new seals I ordered from Bus Depot. The quality is
&gt; nice, I paid for the nicer ones.The seal going around the poptop came out
&gt; 1/2&quot; short,but its no big deal. The luggage seal was perfect, but heres my
&gt; question The large seal which goes on the front of the poptop where the
&gt; carpet hangs down, is not staying up there very well Im not sure if I
&gt; installed it correctly as mine was non exisitence. Does the bevel go
&gt; towards the front of the bus?Do we use glue to make it stay on tight? All
&gt; the other seals are nice and tight any advice?


Unlike the other two seals, the flat seal must be glued, since (as with the
original VW design) it lacks the internal metal clip.  Also, there are
literally several inches of &quot;stretch&quot; on the side seals. If the poptop seal
came up 1/2&quot; short, just pull a little bit (perhaps one side) of it off
again and pull it slightly when reapplying.  It will stretch a tiny bit and
will fit perfectly.
