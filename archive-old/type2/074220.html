Subject: Re: 78FI on a 76 2liter

Mike,

The ECU and AFM's have a different letter suffix to the part numbers for
each year (75 - 79). This implies that they are not identical and may not
play together.

A more obvious problem may be if your 76 is an early 76 I believe that the
AFM has a 6 pin (rather than 7 pin) connector. Your 78 will surely have the
7 pin configuration. This of course effects the connector to the AFM on the
wiring harness as well. This change is to accomodate the air temp sensor
integrated into the AFM.

My advice: Give it a try - if the connectors match it may work - I doubt you
could do any harm by trying this. If you have the AFM for the 78 you could
swap that as well.

Good Luck!
