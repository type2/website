Subject: Re: CV question

&gt; I removed and inspected my CV joints and they looked very good. The are not 
&gt; original so have been replaced. But two of then lack free movement and seem 
&gt; to be jammed. I took one of the jammed ones out and reinspected and 

Those tight ones are probably the better of the CVs. If youve ever felt
new ones they are so tight you are barely able to move them at all.
