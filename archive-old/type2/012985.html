I just wanted to  mention that a common sign of a Type IV engine getting worn and old is a presistant oil leakage at highway speeds that stops at normal around-town driving. This symptom just about drove me nuts replacing pushrod tube seals and valve cover seals and just about every seal I could replace without pulling the engine.

The good news is; it's not bad seals. 
The bad news is; it's blowby across the piston rings pressurizing the crankcase and causing oil to spray out when the engine is stressed. 

What will fix the oil leaks? Simple!! Get the engine rebuilt or install your own long block depending on your inclination or skill. Also, it is not an emergency... you can drive a long way decorating the highway with quarts of oil... and you could probably get by with a partial rebuild (pistons and rings) as long as you carefully inspect everything else. 

I have had three different type IV engines fail in this &quot;oil leak&quot; mode. My last one finally died on the side of the highway due to a dropped seat in the heads ... but it leaked oil on the highway for 15,000 miles first!! So, if you are scratching your head trying to chase down an oil leak ...stop. Just start saving your money for a rebuild and get ya a case of oil to use in the mean time.
