They do have what I consider to be an excessive rate of bad stuff out of 
the box. There are a hell of a lot of low paid immigrants on the assembly 
lines these days, and it shows. 
Thanks for the straight answer. Damn what a pain 
to go through this all again. Well I got my wife well 
versed in brake bleeding. Have you heard anything 
good about the brazil made units? Bowwow sales in
 Seattle said that they have been selling them for 
years. &quot;Great quality&quot; 
Thanks again,
Paul Saulsbury
