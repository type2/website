Subject: Starter Removal

Hello Everyone...Well I am trying to get my darn starter out of my 71 
Campmobile...I have the idiot book, and also the &quot;removing a Starter&quot; 
instructions from Type2 library..but I am a little frustrated/stumped by the 
bolt behind the fan housing...I got the solenoid, hot wire, and the bottom 
bolt undone...just can't find what I should find behind that fan 
housing.....Any helpful hints would be great...Thanks a bunch..Adam

71 Campmobile &quot;Bulli&quot;
St. Augustine, Fl
