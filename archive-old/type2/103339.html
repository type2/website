Subject: Sharing a voltmeter between two batteries

If you ran two seperate circuits from your batteries (4 wires, two to each battery) isolated by a duplex double pole single throw switch, they will be electrically isolated still.

I could fax you an electrical schematic if necessary

&gt;I have somewhat limited real estate for installing gauges in
