2 of 3 busses we bought in the last 2 years..V-dubb multiplying effect..had
been converted to 32/36's. Very few problems in the 40K miles on them, and
not that difficult to learn..there is the list and the books. May be that an
operating FI system is the way to go, but i sure wouldn't discount a good
bus buy due to carb conversion. My $ .02
