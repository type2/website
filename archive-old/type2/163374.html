Subject: Re: [T2] Starter for a 73?

Todd -

Well, the only starter shown in Bosch for the 73 Bus is the SR15, but the
self-supporting SR17 will work.  How does one figure rotation?  If you look
at a SR15 or SR17 at the Front (gear side) of the starter, it appears
to rotate CCW.  If you look from the back (closed) end of the starter, it
appears to rotate CW.  The aircooled VW engine rotates CW.

But the important question to answer is what Bosch Starter Number you
were sold, so that a proper answer as to interchange can be given.  There
are several hundred Bosch starters of different configurations just for the
past 5 years of several European vehicle makes (Audi, Porsche, BMW,
Mercedes, Skoda, Fiat, Seat, etc., let alone starters for the 70s era.

&gt; Hey guys,
&gt;
&gt;    I bought a Porsche 944 a couple of weeks back, and I bought a new
&gt; starter
&gt; for it. It's a BRAND NEW Bosch starter for the 2.5 Porsche motor.
&gt; Unfortunately, it's NOT the &quot;CCW&quot; (Counter-ClockWise) starter and it was
&gt; actually making my engine rotate backwards. I didn't realize this until it
&gt; was
&gt; too late and I couldn't return it. Someone was kind enough to make me
&gt; aware of
&gt; this fact, and why I couldn't get the 944 to start.
&gt;
&gt; I've since corrected the issue, and I ordered a CCW Bosch starter over the
&gt; internet (specified as a CCW). Now, I've got this brand spanking new Bosch
&gt; starter that I cannot return and I was wondering... it appears as though
&gt; practically every european car uses a Bosch starter. Is there any chance
&gt; that I might be so lucky that this clockwise (normal) starter is the exact
&gt; same kind that will fit my Type-2 Bus with the 1800cc motor???
&gt; Please, PLEASE say it's so...
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Todd
