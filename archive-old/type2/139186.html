This is the &quot;funnest&quot; sentence I've seen on the list for quite a while. 
&quot;If&quot; needed? It will be needed.

Sorry, Rusty. Just had to point that out.

&gt; the defrost works, but the van doesn't warm up too much inside, and it 
&gt; doesn't run right now.

Good thing, then, that it's dirt cheap. The only reason to pay more 
than $500 for a bay bus (this doesn't apply to single or double cabs) 
that doesn't run would be exceptionally good (straight) body and paint.
