&lt;&lt; &gt; Is it not polyethylene? There is a good reason many glue tubes and bottle
&gt; are polyethylene . . . nothing sticks well to it.

Thanks for the info. I didnt know.

&gt;
&gt; The only way to properly repair polyethylene is to weld it but you need the
&gt; right tools, technique, and experience to do that. A hot gas jet is used
&gt; rather than an electrode of any sort so forget the soldering iron.

Might try

A good glue site...
