&gt; Once again, there is no way to inspect the valve adequately, no way to

In the absence of being able to properly inspect it to determine how
successful the cleaning was, surely there must be a function test. If
it is a PCV valve, can't it be checked with generic PCV valve function
tests? It's been a long time, but it seems like the last suggestion
was correct: should be able to blow through it from the crankcase
side, but not from the manifold side. Is Bentley silent on this?
