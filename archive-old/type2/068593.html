Subject: Re: Engine Stands

&gt;I have a nice strong watercooled engine stand that will hold and rotate a
&gt;V-8 that I got cash &amp; carry at the local discount tool supply for $45.00,
&gt;not on sale. I've never tried to hang a VW engine from it but I don't see
&gt;why it wouldn't do. Look locally.

&gt;(If you have a bench, then why do you need a stand for a VW engine? I still
&gt;don't understand this. Is it a Type IV thing?)

It is nice to be able to 'easily' rotate a VW engine when rebuilding.  The
fitting that makes this easy (and sorta VW specific) is the yoke that bolts
to the rear (flywheel) end of the engine.   A standard V8 stand has to be
adapted to be useful for a VW engine ....... I see Kevin M. has posted on
how to adapt a bellhousing to this type of stand and use it to build and as
a test stand......

I've always built my engines (and I don't do *a lot* mainly  my own) on top
of a cut down 44 gallon drum (yer Aussie version of the cinderblocks
approach) and I was out to spoil myself.......I think Kevin probably has the
ultimate solution for the same sort of money that a  floor VW stand would
cost....

*sigh* money... you blokes don't know how lucky you are.....so many things
are so much cheaper here (like about half of what they would cost in Aus)
that I'm being sorely tempted to buy things that I would never  consider at
home and 'work around' (like the stand..).

How about  Kymco's kit with dial indicator  which will measure  end
play/rocker geometry/ deck height  (you'd still have to fab a simple plate
to hold the cylinders when doing deck height)  for $45? 

a new universal case (AS21 I presume) for $295?

and  and   and   and..........
