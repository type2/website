&gt; Please reply to Juan at: &lt;iguana_at_superestacion_dot_com.co&gt;.  I've directed him
&gt; to the Type2 Archive and offered my own advice via p-mail.  I'm sure he'd
&gt; appreciate some more input from type IV engine folks.

Actually, I find it useful when these answers are copied to the list. That
way you know what has already been said and need to spend time repeating it
(time *is* scarce). And if someone disagrees, they can add their 2 cents.

Anyway, here's my quick reply to Juan Carlos:  from your account, it sounds
like the overheating problem appeared suddenly and is relatively new. I
would therefore guess that something fixable is out of whack and that you
should not consider adding an oil-cooler yet.

So check all vacuum hoses and their connections for leaks (my favorite
culprit), check the cooling flaps, look for obstruction of the cooling fan,
check your valves, check your timing. If that doesn't fix the problem, let
the list know and I'm sure the heavy-hitters will offer their $200 (!) worth
of comments.

Good luck!

Sami
