Subject: fitting the SVDA and 2L questions

Hi volks.

Turns out the 'mystery engine' in this 73 westy i'm
r&amp;r-ing for a friend is a hyd-lift 2L VW reman.
I'll post the numbers when i get a chance, but please
someone check me:

Piston is non-conical dish (cylindrical depression in
the top of the pistons)  with &quot;93,97 std&quot; stamped into
the top.
That means 94mm..which means 2L, right?

Note to self: locate dial calipers.

Also, the lifters - if when i look up into the bore i
can see a little wire keeper that appears to be
holding the top part or 'cap' in the lifter, then its
a hyd lifer, right?

Note to self: pick up one of those magnet-parts-getter
things.

ok.


issue 2: 

I will be placing an order for an SVDA dist from
aircooled_dot_net this morning.

Someone said something about fitting them into the
type4. There was something about the position of the
vac can and a relocation procedure?

I hereby respectfully ask for a repost of that info.

Thanks in advance for any and all info.

Clark
