&gt; On a type 2 engine, how does oil circulate to the rocker arms?

Correct!

&gt; But how does it get out there and how does it get into the rocker arm
&gt; bearings where I would guess it's most needed?

Oil is (a) pumped to the lifters, after which it is splashed out to the
heads and (b) oil is flung by the crank spinning thru the oil in the sump.
There is no pressurized delivery system to the rockers, just brute
violence done to innocent oil molecules :-)
