What about the orientation of the magnetic fields? Surely this must be a
critical aspect of the operation of the unit. I mean, how can you possibly
align non-polar molecules without some pretty darn precise placement of the
flux lines, right?

Besides, wouldn't the fuel be depolarized when it passes through the
fluctuating EMF of the injectors? What about the zap from the spark plug?
There seem to be a lot of competitors for the allegiance of these molecules.

Just wondering.
