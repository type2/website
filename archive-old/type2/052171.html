I tend to agree with David on this one. Harl*y Davids*n did this exact
thing some 10 years ago(and still are). They have copy righted there brand
names, model names, certain names of parts;ape hanger(handlebars),
hardtail/softail(frames), fat bobs(gas tanks), brand nickname:Hog,Hawg,
they have even gone so far as to try and trademark their engine sound!!
Several parts dealer had to change their shop names if it used any of the
trade marked names. Any parts or accessory that said the above mentioned
names had to be &quot;Licensed&quot; from the Motor Co. like tank name plates,
reproed decals, t-shirts etc.

I am almost certain VW is doing the exact thing, any after market supplier
or dealer selling anything with a VW copy righted name or symbols ie;
reproed VW insignias, VW mud flaps, reproed restoration decals, t-shirts
etc. will have to pay a licensing fee or cease to make said product. I am
almost certain this does not refer to any hard mechanical parts that DO NOT
have a VW part number.

&gt;Before everyone rushes out to crucify VWOA, maybe we should find out what
&gt;their position really is instead of just speculating.  I suspect that they
&gt;are simply going after those who are putting the VW logo on coffee mugs,
&gt;T-shirts, and perhaps counterfeit parts.  If I were in their shoes, I would
&gt;do the same.  Why should someone else capitalize on their name, when VW was
&gt;the company that built the reputation (not to mention our busses) over
&gt;60-some-odd years?
