Subject: Re: How to remove door lock cylinder?

[...]

The code is NOT on the cylinder. Look on the little aluminum pin that is
screwed to the end of the tumbler. The piece that turns to move the latch
linkage. It will be stamped in the side. It will have 2 numbers, the letter
L, then 3 numbers. For example: 20L123


&gt; Bussers,
&gt; I am trying to determine the lock cylinder code on the '70.  As part of
the
&gt; process of the never ending body/paint job in my garage, I have the front
&gt; door handles off.  I have the exploded diagram from Haynes, but can't be
&gt; sure how to release the cylinder, if indeed the code is available on it.
An
&gt; alternate question, assuming the latches are all the same key code, (you
&gt; know what happens when we assume), what is the easiest way to get a key
code
&gt; to at least have a key to try.  I'd hate to have to hire a locksmith.  TIA
