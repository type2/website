Peter,
    Hi.  I had a similiar problem with fumes in the cab.  Turned out to be a
couple of things.
1.)Check your engine compartment seals.  There should be a foam/rubber
gasket sealing the upper half of the engine from the lower.  Check and
replace if neccassary.  Also look at the engine compartment door seals.  VW
busses have a dead spot in their windflow that can cause exhaust fumes from
the muffler to raise up the rear of the bus into the engine compartment
through deterioating/missing seals.  Then it gets sucked into the heating
system and into the cab.
2)Check the seal for the rear hatch.  Same principal as engine compartment
seal, except now it comes straight into the cab skipping the heater.

You need to resolve this issue quickly as your life could be shortened
considerably by prolonged exsposure to exhaust fumes.  Would you run your
bus in a closed garage?

----- Original Message ----- &gt; I seem to be getting exhaust fumes in the cab
of my '78.
&gt;
&gt; I've checked my exhaust and heater connections but all seems fine.
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if anyone else has had a simular problem and how they resolved
&gt; it???
&gt;
&gt; Yours hoping
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Pete
