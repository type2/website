Subject: Re: [T2] Lower L/H Ball Joint Removal (?) 

&gt; Sorry, I forgot you didn't already know what is was thinking...  I would
&gt; follow Bentley.  I wouldn't heat the trailing arm.  I would remove the arm
&gt; myself (did a couple weeks ago).  I would try to remove it myself
&gt; (unsuccessfully).  I would take it with the new joint to a place that knows
&gt; what their doing.

Bus Boys has rebuilt trailing arms for 175 plus 50 for the cores.
Just a thought if you plan to do all 4. I dont know if theyll swap them
individually.
