There is a loophole!  15/32 SAE VACUUM hose is available, a perfect fit,
and will last for many years.  It is only a couple of thousandths of an
inch different that the metric hose!  The  only visible difference is
that it has a smooth rubber cover rather than the OEM fabric cover.

Not every FLAPS carries this size, but a well-equipped one like NAPA
should be able to fix you up!
