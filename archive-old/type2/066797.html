Subject: Vanagon advice - thanks.

All, Thanks for the replies, I had a feeling it was gonna be bearings
but I figured I'd ask around. And thanks for the info on the carbs vs.
FI.

I'm not giving up yet though, the owner is moving in a few weeks and I'm
pretty sure he doesn't want to take all of his vehicles with him. So the
negotiating will continue, I'm in Pa. and finding a clean old van is not
an easy chore, To me a rebuilt job is better than rust work...

thanks again,
RJ.
