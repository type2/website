Subject: Re: type2 Fuel filler elbow (or, I hate Type IV AFC engines

&gt; Yet another reason why I prefer splitties/early Bays
&gt; (or, diesel
&gt; Vanagons):
&gt; 
&gt; On our 77 Westy, how in the heck to I gain access to
&gt; the fuel filler
&gt; elbow?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a bad feeling it involves pulling off the
&gt; charcoal canister, air
&gt; cleaner, and whatever else to remove the access
&gt; panel.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I should buy a Bentley for this Bus.

It's been a few years since I replace mine on my 75
bus, but it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  I
had written it up at the time (it was before I had a
digital camera so I didn't include any pictures), so
it is probably in the archives somewhere, along with
other folks' renditions of the process.

Jim
