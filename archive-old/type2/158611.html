Subject: fuel pump question

i have discovered that either my fuel pump (1978 fuel injected)  is faulty
or the fuel line from the tank is clogged.   i changed the fuel filter and
No fuel came from the tank.   i assumed that fuel would pour out of the line
when i pulled the filter.   i guess my real queston is there any way to
bench test the fuel pump.   i have an ac to dc 12 volt  converter in my
shop.     can i hook up the two leads and  try to pump some fuel from a gas
can or something to eliminate the faulty fuel pump theory?   also if i need
to change the fuel lines i would like to find out some of your opinions on
where to find the best.   i want all of them from the pickup tube all the
way to the injectors.   thank you guys in advance.
