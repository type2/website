My friend has a Riviera camper, but until yesterday we never new exactly
what to call it. Apparently Rivieras were built on the West coast and we
rarely see them here in the Mid-west.  How do you east and west coast
V-dubbers feel about the Riviera?  The guy on the list who found one in the
salvage yard seemed pretty happy, but around here if it isn't a Westphalia
then nobody wants it.  Similar reaction to a Sundial camper I found
recently.  It appeared to be all there and in decent shape, but the owner
couldn't even sell it for the $500 he was asking.  It was a 64 deluxe with a
non-walkthrough Sundial camper interior.  My friends is a 78 with a
penthouse pop-top.  I know of at least one other in a salvage yard that also
has the penthouse pop-top.  Are these things collectible or worth
restoring?

Thanks,
Randall Gammill
