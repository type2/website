Subject: Paint Color Question

I've got a question about two paint colors,

I mentioned it in passing in my review of the Las Vegas Bug-in, and 
received a very helpful response that led me to the webpage with the 
official 1959 VW color book.

Anyhow, I decided I want to paint my singlecab like a bus I saw at 
the show.  I was told by the owner that the colors he used are Lotus 
White and Velvet Green.

The color book doesn't have them in it (I am assuming they are later 
60's colors), and I'm trying to find the mixing codes for them so 
that I can buy the paint later this week.

Does anyone have an idea on where to find this information, or what 
these colors codes are?

Thanks in Advance!
