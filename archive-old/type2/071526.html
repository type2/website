Subject: FOR SALE: Camper in New England (update)
To: type2_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

A few people have emailed me saying that they couldnt access the pictures of 
my Westy for sale. Others seem to access them fine. If you have any problems 
accessing them, please feel free to email, Ethan

For those of you that missed the original post, here it is:

1980 vanagon Westy for sale in Southern Maine (portland to be exact). Spent 
90% of it's life in New Mexico, then moved to Virginia, and finaly to Maine 
about a year ago.It's been parked pretty much the entire time that Ive been 
in Maine.  2 beds, sink, ice box. Seats and beds were recovered about a year 
ago and look nice. Light blue exterior. Tan interior. Rare factory gas 
heater. This camper needs some work, but has had much done already and should 
be an easy project. Certainly not a rusty tub of crap like a lot of the 
campers Ive seen up here.  Was running when parked but when I went to move it 
a couple of weeks ago, it didnt want to start. Selling only because I lost my 
parking space. New landlord has given me until the end of the month. After 
that I'll have to give it to my Ex (please dont make me give it to my ex!!!). 
Feel free to email me about what it needs and what it's already had done. 
$1000 firm Pictures can be viewed at

My apologies to all of those folks that emailed me before requesting 
pictures. Its been a crazy  month.
