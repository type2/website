&gt; 1.   I know from owning beetles that the shifter is supposed to be sloppy.
&gt; Nearly hits dash for 1st, hits emerg brake handle for 3rd, lots and lots
of
&gt; play.  How do you tell whether to replace shifter or tighten at tranny?  

The rear shifter coupling seems to be the weak point in the linkage.  It is
found right where the tranny shifter shaft attaches to the rear shift rod
and is a metal bracket with 2 rubber/plastic inserts held together by a long
setscrew.  These are pretty easy to replace and don't cost much (of course,
you'll end up with a face full of dirt and crap so you might put on your
safety goggles for this one.  When I did mine, I didn't replace the metal
bracket portion (couldn't get to the set screw to remove it) and just
replace the inserts with the new ones.  I used a &quot;high performance&quot;
polyurethane one first and hated it.  It transmitted a lot more tranny noise
up the shiftrod into the bus.  Replaced it with and even cheaper
plastic/rubber one and am much happier.  YMMV
