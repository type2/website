Try and fix the leaky head; valve lapping isn't hard .. I've done it while 
kicking back on the front porch with a beer in the evening. :-)

My understanding is that the phenolic blocks were for FI engines, specifically
to help keep heat from getting to the injectors.  VW used phenolic blocks
on injected Type III's for the same reason.

I could be wrong, though.
