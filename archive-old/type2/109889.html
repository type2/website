&lt;&lt; It's against the law in Ontario. They take points off your license and 
fine you $300 per belt.  The points will be certain to raise your 
insurance rates. That said, Ontario roads have two things you don't see 
too often in saskatchewan: hills and curves.

Anybody who knows about the NYC revenue scam that the traffic laws 
have become will appreciate this: A guy I saw in a NYC deli had an ABC
(or whatever) delivery service jacket on...What was really neat was the
shoulder belt strap that ran from his left shoulder, across his chest to
his belt, Sam Brown belt style...From a few feet away from his truck he
looked like he was wearing a seat belt...

                 are out revenooring... ;-(
