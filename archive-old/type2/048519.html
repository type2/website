Subject: [T2] 1979 ASI Riviera

Hello All,

I am currently restoring a 1979 ASI Riviera Type2.  I am having some
difficulty finding replacement parts for the interior.  Mainly the
re-fridgerator and sink components.  If anyone has some ideas as to where I
might find such items I would be much appreciative.  ( I have looked through
the archives and came up blank.. so any stores, web-sites, or different
ideas would be great).

Thanks!
