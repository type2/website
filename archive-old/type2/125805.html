Subject: Rust above front pan -- 69 Bay

There was a lot of discussion on rust prevention products a few days ago... I 
am looking at a 1969 Baywindow that has been in the family since new.  It was 
taken to Ziebart straight from the showroom floor.  They did a pretty good job, 
but neglected to pull the front pan... so I see plenty of surface rust there.  
My pressure washer did a good job of removing cobwebs and loose paint.  I'd 
appreciate hearing suggestions.  Sandblasting might be best, but possibly 
overkill.  I'm thinking about wirebrushing with my rechargeable drills.  There 
was some mention of a Loctite coating product -- any more specifics, esply the 
full product name and where to buy the stuff in Maryland/Delaware ??  Thanks 
and have a grat Fourth!  Glenn
