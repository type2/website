Subject: Engine dolly plans are in the mail

I'm on my way to a local box to send them out.  Sorry again for the delay,
but you have to admit the price is right (that usually appeals to bus
owners). Good luck with it.  I'm shutting the door on mailed hardcopies for
a while, but good scans are in the type2 library, and I'm exerimenting with
screen captures for emailed versions.  Holler if you would like one of
those.
