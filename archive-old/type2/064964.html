&gt; YAAAY! Thanks for the credit Clara. _Some_ (please chill on the 
&gt; flames just MHO) Americans seem to use the term USA and N. 
&gt; America interchangeably since the feel the continent ends at the 
&gt; northern US border.

&gt; &gt; Many more 60s and 70s panels and trucks were imported to 
&gt; Canada, also part of
&gt; &gt; North America.

Whoa!  You mean all that stuff up north is a different country?  The
border guys (immigration) were not amused last time I said something
like this (Hey, it's a JOKE, guys)

North America, aside from the USofA and Canada, also contains many other
nations, including the VERY popular Mexico, home to many, many fine
transporters!  You old loaf-lovers out there probably know that they
still build loaf transporters in Mexico by the zillions, and this is supposed
to be the build-site for the new Beetles.
