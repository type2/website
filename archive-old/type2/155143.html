Subject: To trim the belt or not

Hey Bob,
          As far as eliminating sources of rust would be concerned, your 
thinking is right on the money.  The original clips sit inside rubber boots; 
but in time the boots go away and the metal clips work against the paint.  If 
you like the look of chrome, I don't think the better stick-on mouldings 
(available at body shop supply places) are a bad way to go.... just my 2&quot; on 
this.  Don't forget to rustproof the inside of the welds if you choose to close-
up the clip holes by welding/brazing.

Glenn

------------ REF -------------------

I need to decide if I want  to weld up the screw holes where the  
beltline trim clips were located, or to leave them be and reattach  
the trim.  Asthetically, the trim did nothing for me, and it is a  
site of rust promotion, so I will probably eliminate them.

Is it a sin to eliminate this?  Anyone struggle with this decision?   
What did you do?  I have the complete set of trim pieces, sans about  
2/3 of the clips.  I will act on this tomorrow.
