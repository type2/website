Howdy Volks,

You really don't need to remove the poptop to paint it. That seems like a
lot of extra unecessary work to me. And since you don't paint the
underside of the top, you don't get near the canvas. I see no particular
tactical reason to do it at the same time as changing canvas, since it's
just as easy to do with canvas on or off. This is not rocket science. I
see no need to pay someone to do it for you, unless you are really
meticulous.

I refinished and repainted my poptop in situ. Scrubbed it clean with
detergent and elbow grease. Polished stubborn spots with a scrubber pad on
an electric drill (probably unecessary). Painted it with a a little less
than a quart each of fiberglass boat paint and primer (on sale at the
hardware store for about $10 each).  Thinned it properly and used a wide
brush. Brush strokes are almost invisible.  Installed new rubber seals
(after market are better because the metal clips are inside the rubber and
thus much less prone to rusting out than the original equipment. ) Shiny,
beautiful, with UV protection build into the paint. Started getting
compliments on it in the beach parking lot right away.

Years later, I had some bodywork done on my bus and the guys repainted the
top. No particular reason to since the old paint still looked good- we
miscommunicated on that point. Sprayed it with automotive paint. No
removal of poptop or canvas, no problem. I believe they masked it with
newspaper before they sprayed.

If your top is cracked, then some fiberglass repair is in order and having
canvas off might be an advantage. I've been doing fiberglass repair on
surfboards since I was a kid. It's not very hard and you can definitely do
it yourself. You need acetone, fiberglass cloth, and resin. Use a mask and
gloves when sanding fiberglass. No need to pay someone to do it, unless
you're really meticulous.

If your top is really really beat, you could replace it. I've looked at a
few poptops removed from buses in a junkyard (Interstate VW, San Diego
County, CA). The hinges were bent on all of them. I'll bet the tops are
pretty cheap from a junkyard, but mind the hinges.

Your actual mileage may vary.

Drive safely,
