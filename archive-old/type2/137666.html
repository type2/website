Subject: Re: [T2]Reactions of dirty oil breather

Hi Chris,

It's not possible for the change in carburetor to change the timing.
You do check timing with vaccum hoses disconnected don't you? But glad
you are running better now.

Also glad your oil leak is down to a slow leak. Just a matter now of
pinpointing the leak. Keep looking for it, you will find it.

Good luck on the job hunt.

John

 well the timing was off by 7 degrees..
 could it have changed that bad from the duals to the
 weber....?
 the timing was right when the duals were on and then
 when i put the weber on it dropped that bad..?
 was almost on TDC at running!
 
 adjusted the idle and timing and she has power again
 or did at least on saturday when i went to the grocery
 store power again on start offs and gearing up
 expecially where she didnt before so must of been
 timing issue power wise?
 
 if not at least i will know for sure then that it isnt
 for sure coming from there.
 
 thanks you all keep you posted on the progress
 throughout the week while out job hunting.
 so now its down to stil a fairly nice oil leak? from
 somewhere.
 doesnt sem to be dropping the level now on the
 dipstick though so hoping its mostly all runoff but
 dont think so think that its still leaking a small
 bit?
 
 
 peace and love
 chris
