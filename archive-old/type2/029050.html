&quot;Hi everyone, I have 2 questions for the collective.  First, how do you
remove the rear view mirror on a 72 bus?&quot;

I usually sit in the passengers seat, grab the mirror with two hands, one up
high on the shaft and the other cradling the mirror, then you have to give
it a Sharp Hard turn to the left or right, in my 72 in can come out to
either side. Once you have loosened it up by turning it you have to turn it
almost side ways to get the post behind the mirror to line up with the exit
holes, once lose you can see how it comes out.

&quot;Second, where can I buy those little aluminum or stainless tie-downs that
are riveted inside the luggage rack on campers?&quot;

Since your saying luggage rack I guess you mean a roof rack or something,
not sure about those?

However if your speaking of the snaps that go around the back window for the
bug screen you can get those at Wal-Mart, however you have to go to the
Sewing Section, the only place I have been able to find them there, or in
Sporting Goods at a K-Mart, I hope this helps.

Meredith

Thanks,

Grant
