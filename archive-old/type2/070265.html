Subject: Roof wood in hand - 65 westy

yesterday i re did one of the muffler seals, which thanks to the header being
tweaked didnt seal right.  wierd, as the header looked almost new.   though
actually i used one piece from one and the other piece from another, and i
believe they both came from when i bought my bug.    i got two for cheap and
tinkered till i drove one away, taking with me the spare, dead motor.
     then i bought a new brasilian bug muffler for $20, and tossed the
headers in a pile.   now resurrected on the 65 westy, i hope the d*mn thing
seals and stays sealed.   those tubes were more difficult than they needed to
be to get into place.

(i hope i didnt space, and re tell the saga of the muffler-  its a painful
tail, and i think i wont bother to tell the full story just be aware that it
can be a royal pain in the *ss to install a header, and i would have rather
used a stock bus muffler, but i am SOL on several counts)

also, the rear window found it's way home, after a proper clean off of rust,
extend and new paint on the window ledge.   waiting for the paint to drysome
friends and i went to kinko's where jan made nifty stickers she plans to sell
at the vw meets.  Bugster proundly sports one now, even though he is the bug
of few stickers.   popped in the rear window, with it's lovely form fitted
seal with actual CORNERS molded into the rubber 
 (we're not worthy)  which i found in the garage and roofing tar on the
window ledge as extra sealant. roofing tar is good :)

   I LIKE SAFARI WINDOWS ON A HOT DAY  :)   

after stopping to put air in the tires and drop off jan at home, hudson&amp; i
went to the junkyard, where the yard guy told me they had crushed the bus
with the wood, and i should put carpet in there

smartass

and thanks to your wonderful help, thank you, it was surprising how many
people responded to my confusion about westy roof wood, i had a better clue
about how to remove it.    took about four minutes to get both pieces out.  i
destroyed the trashed over cab bit, then pulled the metal piece forward (FIF)
and out.  pulling the wood down in the middle, and up right above the rail it
slides in on the sides, and hudson doing the same at the rear of the wood, it
was popped out of the track on one side, then we did the sameon the other
side.  so easy  :)    fiberglass everywhere, though.
found some nice tail light bulb holders too, (62-71 type) and an engine to
body seal that looked new.  there are good engine lid hinges there on two
buses.   maybe i'll go back with the propane torch, water squirt bottle, and
ratchet screwdriver to get them.    or send mike who lives closer.

and the bus seemed to drive okay.   the motor seems to have plenty of power,
and it stops great.   even goes straight down the road.  wierd.    still
needs

different rod in passenger door so it can be opened from the inside
brown paint cleaned off dash
bent tie rod replaced, and then get aligned
tranny oil changed, also steering gear box oil
locks keyed
seat covers for the front seats
bench/bed fixed so you can lean back with out the back of the seat flopping
overhead air vent de rusted and functional
interior lights functional
tires that dont go flat (one did) ill need two spares, a 14r 205, and a 14r
185, as the fronts            
           are differnt from the rear.   or get them all unified.
basic tools in bus.
windshield wiper motor and wipers with safari disconnects
 
ill do a hundred mile service, just to check out everything, as i am
concerned about a motor that sat for 4 + years in this climate.  i dont want
a stuck valve.

i t DOES have a V_at_L sticker that Jack Stafford gave me on his way to Inuvik  
and the roof rack is on it!!!   im so excited!!  happy camper.
