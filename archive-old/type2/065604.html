Subject: Tea leaf test for oil leak location

 my general ideas about oil leaks boil down to this (for an upright motor)
look at the pavement where the car sits, and do a tea leaf test:

drips under where the engine bolts to the trans - main seal

drips a t each side under heater boxes- -   valve cover gaskets

drips in middle - possibly oil change gaskets, or any of the next leaks

wet on the left side when you look at the motor - oil cooler seals

wet only on the lower left tin - oil pressure sender (look by sender)

wet on right -  oil fill neck not screwed in well/ sloppy oil filling.

Helps to take it to the presurre wash to figure out the leaks, and to pull a
motor with minimal grease stress.
