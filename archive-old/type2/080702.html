&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I've sent some pics off to Rob Henley at http://www.72camper_dot_com so
&gt; hopefully we'll see them there in the future. I'm certainly willing to
take
&gt; more if there is interest (and somewhere to place them on the net for the
&gt; benefit of other listees.)
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
