Someone on the list gave me some info on a document or file to download for 
looking up part #s and what they refer to. I downloaded edonkey then searched 
for the file and found it but when I type d 1 and hit enter it says it is 
downloading but nothing seems to be happening any ideas or a help line I can 
ask.
