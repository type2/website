If you are going to replace the shoes, then just go ahead and blast it with
a good penetrating oil, then wait about a 1/2 hr. and do it again. It would
be very difficult to remove the drums without backing off the adjusters. I
take it this hasn't been disassembled before? Once apart, disassemble all
the adjuster parts and go buy yourself some Never-Seize compound to put on
all the threaded bits. I use the copper based stuff, it is the best thing
going. ALL my bolts and nuts get a dab when they are apart, lugnuts,
mounting bolts, you name it. 

HTH,

Courtney

Can't get 'em loose! any suggestions? Is it OK to spray PB Blaster in there
or will I soak the shoes? Of course I'm hoping to get them out anyway.
Should the drums slide off without loosening the stars? They don't- the
stars are my only hope.

Please Help! -Chris 73 Westy
