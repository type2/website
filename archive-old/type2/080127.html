&gt; Hey folks -- I'm trying to get the locks adjusted on
&gt; my 71 bus (Westy interior but no pop-top), and it's
&gt; driving me nuts!  I can't get the front doors (driver
&gt; &amp; passenger) to unlock with the key.  Any ideas on
&gt; adjustments?  It's like the little device on the end
&gt; of the tumber doesn't turn far enough to unlock the
&gt; door to open it from the outside.  I have tried
&gt; lubricating the tumber and have looked for adjusters
&gt; with no luck.  Is this common on these beasts?

There is no real adjustment there.  It might be that you have a broken
spring on the latch assembly.  If you can close the door with the lock set
from the inside _without_ pulling the outside latch trigger and have the
door stay locked, you have the broken spring problem.
The broken spring also makes the door hard to unlock from the outside and
will eventually break the lock cylinder.

The fix is on the www.type2_dot_com website.
