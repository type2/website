&gt;  I'm wondering if anyone has put
&gt; some miles on Red-line or another synthetic trans oil.  Any troubles?

got synthetic ATF fluid in my auto tranny 78 and Synthetic in the final
drive...no problems, have been running both for several years.
the ATF is Mobil synthetic
 the final drive I believe is Valvoline synthetic 80-90wt
