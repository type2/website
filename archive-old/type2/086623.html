Subject: Camping Stool/Trash Bin Measurements

To those who received my e-mail with the dimensions of the abovementioned
stool. Karl had been so kind to advise that the measurements I sent out
were for '77 and up, as noted below. If you need the '76 or earlier
dimensions you should e-mail him, as he, I believe, has a nice collection
of these little rarities. (All for busses he owns, he's not some sort of
weird stool collecteor :-)

Don't forget....the height measurement only applies to 77 and up. 76 is
shorter because the pass seat does not swivel.
I have that figure also....just not handy. Remember the pic of 3? The
center
one is for 76.

&gt;
&gt; I have come to find that this item is one you will  have difficulty
&gt; finding. The people who have them dont want to sell them for under $200.,
&gt; and thats just way too much money for a box. I am going to make one
myself.
&gt; I have the dimensions from another kind listee. I can fwd them to anyone
&gt; who wishes.
