Subject: Rust around the window (and how bad is surface rust)

Hi Everyone,

So, my front windshield seals are shot. I'm not sure how long it's been that way
but it's prolly be a while. My worry is that once the windshield is out I'm
gonna find rust everywhere. Is there anyway to tell how badly rusted the front
may be without pulling the window (Perhaps sound echo)?

And speaking of rust, I've been reading all of the articles about rust but I've
still got a few questions:

How bad is surface rust? Is it best to sand and use a &quot;rust-reducing&quot; based
primer, ala 3M? Lots of ppl thru the archives indicate the a regular primer may
be just fine.
How long can only primer stay on? I've got lots of little rust spots all over
the roof and &quot;rain-gutter&quot; rails. And how is it that little rust spots form all
over the roof. It's almost like raindrops hit the roof and turned it immediately
to rust.

Sorry to ask so many questions in one post. I'm just really curious and am
having trouble finding some of the answers.

Cheers,
Harry
