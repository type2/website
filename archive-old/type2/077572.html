Subject: 79 Speedo in 72 Bus

I have a 72 bus with a dash from a 79 including the instrument cluster.  I 
just used the 72 cable to drive the speedo since I didn't need the extra 
sensor pickup the 79 cable has.  Unfortunately the reading on the 79 
speedometer seems to be much higher than the actual speed by 5 to 10 mph.  
Is there an imcompatibility I am not aware of?  I am running 185R14 Yokohama 
356s which I think are standard diameter.

Anyone ever try to install a programmable VDO speedo?

I don't mind putting around at a few miles below the speed limit, but an 
incident this past weekend made me decide to figure something out.  Some 
idiot decided my bus wasn't fast enough and pulled out to pass and didn't 
make it causing two oncoming cars to swerve off the road and driving me into 
the break down lane with his horn blaring by me.  When I finally came to 
stop light a few miles up, another driver started yelling at me that my bus 
was a hazard on the road and the near head on collision would have been my 
fault.  I was doing 60 mph on my speedo at the time in a 55 mph, but the 
real speed probably was in the 52-53 range.  Seems most people don't have 
the patience to do anything less than 5 to 10 mph over the speed limit, so I 
should probably at least do the speed limit, so an accurate speedo would be 
really nice so I don't have to guess my actual speed.

Thanks in advance for any help.
