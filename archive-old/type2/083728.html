Subject: New guy with carb trouble (long)

--0-2013884851-1022266831=:5797


Hello all, 71 Dormobile with a bug engine installed by p.o. 34 pict-3 carb. Anyway touble is engine wont idle. Check timing, (statically), valves, and some minor carb adjustments. Finally found a piece of rubber in needle and seat and replaced just in case. New line, filter and still having trouble with idle. I tried to adjust carb by using the library and the instructions and just wont idle at all with the idle screw just barely touching the fast idle cam. Am I incorrect trying to adjust this way? 

Also when I squeeze the vacuum line to the booster it seems to run a little bit better, is this normal or do I have a vaccum leak in the booster?

Runs fine while under power but dies when I push the clutch in for a stop sign. 

This is driving me crazy, any comments would be appreaciated.

Paul Saulsbury
