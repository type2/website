To the tool list that others have already posted I would add:

Rags

Hand Cleaner

Baby wipes, besides cleaning skin, I have found them handy for wiping 
off oily electrical wires and other engine parts.

Flashlights, I carry a big D cell Maglight, a AAA cell MiniMaglight 
and a florescent Snake Light.

Spare turn signal and brake light lamps.

A piece of 3/4 inch plywood that is 10 x 10 inch square, used to keep 
a jack from sinking into soft ground.

Battery terminal brush
