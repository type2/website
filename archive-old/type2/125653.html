Subject: New-fangled FI plenum

Every time I page through Ron Fornier's sheet metal book, I get the 
idea that I would like to do a more updated plenum for my 2.0L engine. 
Seems like it wouldn't be a bad idea, either, if it were possible to 
eliminate the coupling hoses.

When I start to cook this up, I get stuck on two question/problems:

1. The width of the engine cannot be fixed (hence those pesky hoses) 
because CR is adjusted by adding or taking out rings. Seems to me that 
the best way to resolve this is by making up custom-width gaskets 
between runners and heads.

Anyone have a better way?

2. I wonder whether the volume inside the plenum is critical. Once air 
passes through the AFM and gets metered, does it matter how much air is 
inside the plenum?

Any ideas would be helpful.
