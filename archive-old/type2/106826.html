Subject: Tune-up question

Well, I started the task of doing a tune-up on my '72 bus. When I went
to replace my spark plugs, I noticed that there were these sheet metal
cover screwed to the top of them on either side of the engine. My
question is, when I finally get them removed to replace my spark plugs,
do I really need to put them back on? They appear to be some type of
cosmetic covering and thus far have proven to be somewhat of a challenge
to get off.
