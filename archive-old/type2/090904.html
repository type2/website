Subject: How big is a BA6? I want a 22.5 Gallon Winkler Tank

I am thinking about replacing my BA6 with a new B3LC Compact 
for two reasons:

1) The B3LC has a much lower electrical consumption (3.0 amps 
_at_ 12,000 BTU's) so I can use it as a winter camping heater 
without running the engine

2) (The B3LC is smaller at 16.6&quot; LOA and may allow me to 
install the 22.5 Winkler tank I have been pining away for 
since I bought my van.

I know I could just pull the bellypan off and measure but 
does anyone know how big the BA6 is?

Thanks,
Chris
