Subject: Heater question update

Ok, looks like the gas heater is not the solution. I went out to Suegro and
got down on the floor. I can't lift the driver seat as a PPO changed them
out for some other buckets that are bolted to a piece of plywood which in
turn is bolted to the pedestal. That's a fix for later.

The rod IS connected to a cable, which dives under the bus. This connected
to what appears to be a Y valve, as previously mentioned. So, I guess I'll
have to see if there is any air coming up to this valve in the first place.

This really puzzled me, as I had never seen the vents inside the van.
Reason: The PPO had covered them up and filled them with insulating
material. I'm sure I'll find out why soon enough, but I plan to unplug the
vents (for reference they are in the &quot;step up&quot; of the walkthrough) and see
if there is airflow.

Thanks folks for the help on that one. Anyone have any ideas on my brake
issue?
