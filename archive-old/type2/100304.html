Subject: VW Trends Charity Cruise - Two Last Things

VWTCC Bay Attendees -

Two last things:

1) We'll be on FRS/GMRS Channel 2 for communications. If you don't have an 
FRS/GMRS, either go buy one or two (they're cheap at $15/ea), or I will have 
a couple extra with me. Look for a white '69 Westy with a white awning 
hanging off the side.

2) Jim will be handing out MapBlast directions that'll get you from Point-A 
to Point-B to ... to Wahoo's Fish Taco joint. Anyone that was out there last 
year surely remembers the adventure trying to find West Coast Classics and 
Wahoo's, yes? Look for a Screaming Yellow '72 Weekender w/Mercedes alloys. 
Can't miss it.
