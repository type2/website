Subject: Re: [T2] black smoke during backfires

Jason,
Quick question:
When you are idling AND the timing is at 10 AFTER...
Disconnect the inboard [on the flat side] vacuum
retard hose.

Does the timing jump to 7.5 before?

Does the idle speed increase?

If neither happens, DO NOT SET THE TIMING TO 10
AFTER!!

Set it to 7.5 BEFORE, you are severely retarding your
engine.

That timing spec is ONLY VALID IF YOUR VACUUM RETARD
IS WORKING and the engine is idling.

I keep bringing this point up EVERY time a dual vacuum
timing question comes up and I have to repeat it over
and over.

  Hi everyone, I am still working on my 1974 vw bus
 1800cc engine with 005 distributor.  I reset the
 points gap to a dwell of 50 degrees and retimed the
 engine to 10 degrees after TDC.  I am noticing that
 if
 i rev the engine and release the throttle there is
 slight backfiring accompanied with blacksmoke.  What
 is going on to make the backfiring/popcorn sound.  I
 still have a continual pop pop pop out of the
 exhaust
 also.
