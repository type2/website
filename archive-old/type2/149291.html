Subject: Ceiling AC Unit

Does anyone have a photo of the &quot;H&quot; shaped AC unit that is mounted overhead
in the cab.  I'm selling one complete unit, and I have a potential buyer,
but she'd like a picture of it in the vehicle, and I've partly removed the
one that I have.  I'd rather not put it back just for the picture, only to
have to remove it again.
