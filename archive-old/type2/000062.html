Pulled the engine on my 71 bus to put a thermostat in, replace the generator 
with an alternator, replace the intake manifold boots, clean it up, etc.,  
and much to my surprise when I could see clearly over half of the cv joint 
bolts had backed off, some of them a little, some of them a lot.  I know that 
this happens but just never bothered to check mine since I replaced them a 
little over two years ago.  Two of the boots were also torn and they were 
Lobro.  Check your cv joint bolts.  Luckily I found mine before a 
catastrophic failure in the middle of nowhere.
