Subject: Re: [T2] 2L dual carb to FI

&gt;well to ask the obvious question, why do you want to degrade the motor, it
&gt;was designed to be FI and is now FI, and your 77 was designed to be FI, so
&gt;why in the name of Dr Porsche do you want to make it less than it is
&gt;designed to be....I could get into the DM now but I will pass on that

If you're going to take a fuel injection motor to carbs, you might as well 
get some bigger valves and a slightly wilder cam to take advantage of the 
carb... IMHO the EFI heads are not as good as they could be since VW 
detuned the engine to play well with the EFI.
