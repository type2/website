Subject: RE No Good Deed Goes Unpunished Saga

Regarding the episode where i caught a thief in a 72 VW Bus in my garage--Trust me, not
only is he a Non-Listee--
But really NOT a VW Bus person at all!!--His game was locating &quot;rolling&quot; VW Buses and
converting them into campers--NOT powered by any motor at all--He would be using the tow
bars to &quot;move&quot; these buses wherever the &quot;Camper&quot;? was wanted by his customer--He was
referred to me by a local VW shop in Phoenix--They are NOT to blame on this as they are VW
Friends of mine and were very upset about what happened, as i contacted them afterward by
phone. So the &quot;Word&quot;  is out on him in Phoenix to be sure--He goes by at least two
names--&quot;Charley&quot; an alias that he used on the phone and his real name Phil--He was a lot
younger then myself--of course at my age 65--a LOT of people are!! But if needed,- i would
have had no trouble &quot;Taking Out&quot;!! Trust me on this!!  I felt that giving him his money
back and retrieving the tow bar sent a message, that for him the party is over!!And
through the VW underground in Phoenix--Its over!!  ,uj
