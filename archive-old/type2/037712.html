Absolutely!
	This is why small plane pilots have a GREAT respect for thier carb-heaters.
When you come in to land a small plane, the temputure in the carb area drops
significantly (don't ask, i haven't gotten to that chapter yet), and if it
ices up it will stall out.  That is no laughing matter when only 1000 feet
off the ground!
	As far as cures, check this.  On the right side of the engine see if you
have a piece from your air filter set up that goes through the front engine
tin.  If so, get under the bus and see if there is a dect that goes from
that position and makes a shallow U back into another piece of tin.  That
set up pulls warm air directly off the head and into your air system.  There
is a good picture of what I am poorly describing in the Haynes manual.  If
not, I suggest replacing the missing parts as this will keep the air to your
carbs a bit warmer.

Hope this helps,

     Sorry for this but just remembered another unrelated bus prob.
As i was driving home along with the brake warning light snag the bus was
sluggish at low rpms and would stall at a stop.
Checking at home (45 min drive) i noticed the right hand intake manifold(73
westy dual stock carbs) was white,
Ice! Man i thought the type 4 with the short manifolds was almost immune to
this but it was ice.
Would this cause the stalling?

Cure?

Thanks Again All
