Subject: RE: [T2] Shaking and Shuttering

First, replace the fuel filter (is it full of crappola?). 
 
Then run the fuel pump w/ ignition on/engine off by removing the air cleaner and opening the AFM flapper with a pencil. Should make a nice quiet, smooth hum. If loud, grindy, or sputtering noises, then it probably is bad or the line is clogged in the tank. Bad fuel pumps tend to act up more when hot...
 
If the tank is clogged, best bet is to remove, clean, and preserve it. You might try blowing &amp; draining all the crap out through the inlet &amp; return lines if you're in a hurry (careful, fire hazard).
 
Then check fuel pressure at various RPM's. Could be a bad fuel pressure regulator?
 
After that, troubleshoot the FI per Bentley or the T2 Library.
 
If the tach &amp; speedo don't stay in sync, then your clutch mifgt be slipping too, but most of your symptoms sound fuel realted.
