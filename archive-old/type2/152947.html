Subject: Re: [T2] Carb balancing

Marcus,

Thanks for the reply and for the advice, I will follow these steps as
it seems that I should start from scratch and thus I will find the
problem. I have a gas analyser but only for CO.....

yours

Charles

&gt;
&gt; There is a basic adjustment for the throttle plate gap. I think it is 1.5
&gt; turns from the point where the stop screw touches the carb body - at that
&gt; point your central idle thingy should come into the game, but I have no
idea
&gt; how because my carbs don't have that. I only have the stop plate screws for
&gt; my idle adjustment. There is also a more accurate feeler gauge adjustment,
&gt; but for that the carbs need to come off the manifolds.
