I have a used one for $125 (plus shipping).  Not tested, and sold as-is.
Has surface rust, of course, but appears structurally sound to my eyes.  The
valve opens and closes, but since there is no propane I didn't check it
beyond that.  You will need one L-shaped bracket to mount it to the bus,
easily fashioned out of a small piece of angle iron, nothing fancy; other
than that everything is there.

Another option is that I can provide you with a brand new Vanagon Westfalia
propane tank for $199.95 including valve, etc..  This tank is somewhat
larger, since the Vanagon used a propane-powered fridge.  You will have to
fabricate your own mount for it, as it is a direct bolt-on only onto a
Vanagon.  I doubt that this would be difficult to do.  Lead time is about 6
weeks on these as they are made to order.
