I am not on the Type 2 list so if someone could forward this to them for me
I would appreciate it.  Or if someone on this list is looking for engine
rebuilding parts for your 1.8l Air Cooled engine, look no further.  I was
going to rebuild this 1.8l engine myself, but never got around to it.  I
sold the van on ebay so I don't need the engine any more.  As you may know
the 1.8l engine parts are getting hard/impossible to come by.  I have two
rebuilt heads (Boston Engine), Rebuilt Rods (BE), New Pistons and Cylinders
(CoFap), and everything else you would need to do this rebuild.  I also have
a good case, crank and cam.  If you are looking for these parts let me know
and I can get you pricing on them.

Thanks,
Ken Wilford
