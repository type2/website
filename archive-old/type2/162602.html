&gt; &gt; I've done this before it is not that hard, have nice piece of side
&gt; &gt; window glass (one piece) and brand new rubber from BD but can't get
&gt; &gt; the rubber to stay on the glass while I get it into the opening,
&gt;
&gt; is it the correct size rubber? the few windows I have installed all fit

BINGO, rubber is obviously the wrong size, shoved an old piece on and it
fits &quot;Correct&quot;   so now I'm stuck with a new gasket that doesn't fit and
an old dry rotted gasket.... and of course the BD is closed today so gotta
wait til Monday to get a new gasket next  day'ed to me. so much for gettin
the new door on today.... mumble mumble mumble.... best laid plans etc...

thanks
Bob
