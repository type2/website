Subject: RE: Trip Report: Border partings :-(

I always worry that some PO has hidden a stash in my bus and that if it's
ever searched, say at a border crossing, I'll get busted.  Has this ever
happened to anyone?

Of course, my bus is painted like a cow (white with black spots) so I'm
kind a target anyway, which makes me a bit paranoid.  I've been pulled
over many times, even been given a breathalizer once (I hadn't had a drop,
but apparently I'm clumsy enough to fail the sobriety test when sober).

I haven't been to Canada is my bus, but I'm sure eventually I will make
the trip, as it is only about a 2 hour drivel. Maybe I'll just bring my
Canandian roomate along for protection, eh?
