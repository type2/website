&gt;So [apart from pricing studded tires] maybe Sean's right--Maybe I need to
&gt;go find that parking lot at 3am and experiment a little, if only to make
&gt;myself a little more comfortable with this thing.

My dad handed me the cars keys after the first big snow of my 16th year
and told me to go out and get stuck somewhere.  As a result of that i can
say that I'm a better than average snow-driver, and more importantly I
have confidence in my bad weather driving ability.  Panic/fear are the
worst things to take no the road with you.

We just got a bunch of snow here in Seattle, and I learned a few things.
First, my tires suck. They came with the bus and I'm going to change them
next chance I get, for some more aggressive ones.  Second, the bus isn't
as bad as I thought it would be.  It seems to be large enought to resist
sliding.  HOWEVER, it is very tail heavy, so once it goes be ready to ride
it out, because all that weight in the back will not be denied.  If (and
this happened yesterday) the back end slides, it is harder to stop than in
a regular car, so be ready for it.  

Other than that little problem, there is nothing a good set of chains
can't bail you out of, in a bus.
