Subject: Steering Box

Dan and list,

I had the same situation with the steering box on my 68 many years ago.  I
had a parts bus with a good box in it, but there was no way I could remove
it.  The local VW shop towed the parts bus into their shop, and had to use
an oxyacatylene torch to get the arm off.  It cost me $40 in labor, I did
the rest of the install myself. Good luck
