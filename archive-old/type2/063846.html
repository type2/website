HI all,
  Wanted to toss out a final post about the NorthWest Arkansas Volkswagen
Association Show this weekend in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.  Eureka is at
the top of Arkansas about 50 miles from Oklahoma and 30 miles from Missouri.
  The following is quoted from a flyer that was flying around at the
Springfield Missouri show (Busses on 66).  A fine show also.
