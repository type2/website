&gt; I'll second that - One insurance company tells me my bus is worth $20K
&gt; - another says $13K and yet another says $8K.... now what's wrong with
&gt; this picture? I'd love to know what an old car value guide has to say!

That brings up a very good point about older vehicles. With new cars, 
everyone has a pretty good idea what they are worth. After a vehicle 
gets to be more than 5 or 6 years of age, its value is totally up for 
grabs. When buying insurance, check with your agent, and get some 
pictures and a stated value (in writing) on file, and get a copy for 
yourself. If you make any changes to the vehicle's value, get a new 
estimate and pictures.

A few years ago, a friend of mine had a bus that was fairly rare. It was 
a deluxe... and I think this was one with the corner windows. Over 5 
years he went through it from end to end. When done, the van looked as 
good as any I've seen, and the only thing lacking was having the door 
panels recovered. While parked at the local mall, it was side swiped, 
doing about $1500 in damage. The insurance company totalled the vehicle, 
and wanted to pay him $800.

It took an attorney to get them to pay for the repairs, and not total 
the van. The insurance company then proceeded to cancel his insurance, 
although this wasn't a chargable accident (his only other claim in 3 
years was for a broken windshield). As it worked out, he had to take it 
into a shop for repairs, also. We could have fixed it for about $300 in 
parts and materials, but insurance companies don't allow you to collect 
on labor for fixing your own rig.
