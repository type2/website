Subject: Additional battery

 	Hi there,

	While this thread is still on I want to suggest a little addition. When I
bought a 12V cooling box for my Kombi it was supplied with a &quot;battery
saver&quot;. It´s a little extension cord that goes between the cigarette plug
and the cooling box. The thing has some electronics that cuts off the
current when the voltage goes under 11.5 volts. When the voltage is back
over 12V it switches the power on.

	 It´s rated for max 5A so I put it to operate a relay that cuts off the
current from the additional battery. This means that my radio, cooling box,
CB and interior lightning goes out before the voltage is too low. Helps
keeping the battery from going compleatly empty. It has only cut out once
so far. That was when we was playing to loud and too long on the
stereo.(The &quot;boosters and lots off speakers&quot; type off stereo)

	Hope this helped somebody,

BTW I´m the relay kind off guy too
