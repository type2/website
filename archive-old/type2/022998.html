&gt;in the June 2001 issue of VW trends there is an article on indexing your
&gt;spark plugs, (facing the gap in the right direction), does any body know the
&gt;correct direction for a 2000cc engine????

I don't think it really matters what type of engine it is, the gap is 
supposed to be facing the intake valve.  I bought the spacers and went 
through this on my Mustang, and the results weren't worth the trouble, YMMV.
