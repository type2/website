Subject: Re: [T2] Suggestions anyone?

We have seen Pucks have the connector under the trailer, therefore out 
of sight.
We have a cable (the male 120 volt standard connector) carefully &quot;lose&quot; 
next to our battery and you just open the motor rear cover and there you 
have it when you want it and you can leave the cover down but not 
latched.  This also keeps the connection out of the weather.
