Subject: Tie rods and steering dampener

Hi,

I have a pair of tie rods to install on the bus and noticed that the 
steering dampener looks like it is the original. I need to get one 
quickly so the question is has anyone been able to source one from a 
retail parts store such as NAPA, Autozone, Advance, etc. No time for 
mail order

As for replacing tie rods, which I have not done, is there anything 
special needed to do the job? I was told by an old school VW fellow 
in town that if you undo the bolts and hit the rod with a hammer near 
the ball ends it will flex enough to just pop out. Nothing ever works 
out that easy for me so any other experiences would be good to hear.

Thanks
Chris
