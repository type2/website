Subject: Re:  Paint

Todd.....I have had to get mine at a  shop that supplies automotive spray 
painters, the guys who do it for a living. Most shops mix a pint as the 
smallest amount they will work with. You will need the paint code from your 
vehicle. Cost of a pint is almost as much as a quart. Ask questions first. 
Know what kind of paint you want: Enamel, lacquer, etc.  and decide if you 
are going to brush it on or spray it with one of those PREVAL units. If you 
don't know what I'm talking about, ask the paint shop to explain the PREVAL 
system to you. Almost everyone sells them. It lets you mix and spray small 
amounts of paint.

Also, if you want to avoid messing around with the PREVAL system, you could 
take the paint code to a supplier of custom mixed automotive paint and have 
them make up a disposable spray can for you.  Not everyone does custom 
spray cans, so call around and ask first. Someone will point you to a 
supplier. Be sure to get cost estimates and specifications of what you will 
get for your money. I would guess you are talking about enamel.

We will assume you know how to prepare your vehicle's surfaces for 
touch-up. I usually use a waterproof epoxy to fill the deeper flaws. I use 
SUPERMEND from the Ace Hardware, made by Titan Corporation, 5629  208th 
Street S.W., Lynwood, WA  98036, USA.  About $7.  I Dremel the flaw to 
remove rust, clean it with alcohol, apply a dab of the epoxy and give it a 
day or so to cure. Then I sand it flat, prime it, and after another day of 
drying and curing, I apply the color coat. I've done patches as big as a 
silver dollar with this approach.

get touch up paint?
thanks.
