Subject: Oil temp sender pics

I changed my oil and installed an oil temp sender by replacing the stock
sump plate.

I found the sender in a '73 914 sump plate at the junkyard a while back.
From the pictures you can see that the dipstick is designed to protrude into
the bump of the stock sump plate.  The 914 plate with the sender can only be
oriented one way in the case and you need to cut 2cm off the end.

Thanks to Steve Dolan for bringing this to my attention.

I guess with the same dipstick the top line will read a little less than
full because the sender is taking up space in the sump but it can't be that
much different.

Also, I noticed that there is a paper gasket between the sump plate and the
cover plate for the sender but I haven't been able to locate a part number
for it.

I found the o-ring for the sump plate at Bus Boys for $6.  The old one was
definitely loose by comparison and was causing me an oil leak.
