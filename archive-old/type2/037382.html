Peter,

I must agree with Mike.  I have a '78 and nearly lost my rebuilt engine after trusting some clutch work in a shop without inspecting it. They had replaced the seal but only half-heartedly inserted it.  200 miles into a 500 mile trek something didn't feel right.  When I checked at the rest stop there were hard to reach areas near the tranny that hadn't been tucked in/sealed.  After sealing it and letting it cool down I was back on the road but haven't gotten the same milage since.  It's like they say, never ASSume and always get a second opinion.

Learning the hard way too,
