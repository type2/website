Subject: Buying a bus from a (now-former) listee: or, Joel, change the
 stats! (longish)

Greetings!

You may recall that several weeks ago, Len Alcamo posted a note saying that
he was selling his 78 Westy after he had had some frustration in getting a
new engine to keep running.

Here's Len's post:

Hi Volks,

I want start out by saying that I've enjoyed my 3 years or so on this list
immensely. A finer bunch of helpful, sharing, clever and knowledgeable folks
couldn't be found anywhere. Although the only personal contact I've had with
any listees is the time I spent with the ubiquitous Charlie Ford, I feel
like I have a kinship with many others and hopefully will met some of you
someday.

I haven't used a Vdub for a daily driver for about four years now mostly
because from an economic standpoint it is not very practical for me to do so
in this area.........no junkers, no mechanics no real support of any kind.
We had a shop that specialized in VWs but  they closed up. Within a couple
of years most all  of the VWs were gone off the streets.
  Truckin' around and camping in a Westy is a great pleasure but at this
point its not realistic for us anymore (wonder if it ever was and if I
really cared). You all know that this pleasure doesn't come cheap. Our trips
are longer and the time we have is shorter so we take the easy way and climb
into our eminently reliable oriental transportation device.... highball down
the freeway, get there and back..no fuss no muss. Kinda ho-hum traveling...
getting there has become less then half the fun  thats for sure.

Anyway, I'm selling off my bus and the bus stuff that I have.

'78 Westy deluxe 4speed..... new  2.0L hyd lifter low compression long block
from Protech in California with new clutch assembly
standard Weber 2 bbl setup..  Compufire in a 009...electric fuel pump.. many
other new parts
This motor has only been run for about 10 minutes (ran into some electrical
and dizzy glitches.. and so it sits)
Complete original interior with tables, screens and curtains stove fridge
etc. pretty decent...  with good canvas.
Wisconsin body ( skin rust in the usual places and ratty paint) but its
straight and never been hit... axle beams solid and always greased
I'll just stop here ...pmail or call for the rest of the story if
interested.

I'd like around $1800.00 for it

Bus is located in Fountain City Wisconsin....100 miles south of
Minneapolis/St Paul

Charlie Ford has seen this bus and he would probably tell you that it
appears that care was taken with the engine assembly and the quality of the
parts used. Then again he might tell you its a piece of crap.... either way
it will be an unbiased opinion I'm sure.

I also have a good auto tranny and bad motor from a '74 and other misc.
parts.

Well thats the story.  No more bussin for this guy in the foreseeable
future. I've owned Volksie for 30 years and I'm not ever going to not own
one so........ I plan to pick up a dune buggy next spring to play with and
fix up. Should be great fun! Never owned one yet. If someone can tell me
where the buggy folks hang out on the net I'd appreciate it.

&lt;end of Len's post&gt;

I know that any time any active listee sells a bus, a little ripple runs
through the list. We all know how frustrating it can be to fix and keep
running these vehicles; we also know how attached we become to them. So I
suspect that when we see a long-time listee selling, we say: Do not ask for
whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. Or we think: there but for the
grace of God....

That was my reaction when I read Len's post, or something like that.

Len's posting was also significant to me as he is one of the relatively few
bus owners on the list in Wisconsin outside of Madison and Milwaukee, and
so I really paid attention when he posted his for sale ad on the list. I
had never met him, however.

I had another reason for being attentive to for sale ads. About three weeks
ago, my wife was driving our 91 Geo Metro through an intersection in our
small town (Fond du Lac, WI, population: about 38,000) when a woman at a
stop sign, with my wife was right in front of her, accelerated from the
stop sign and bashed the rear passenger side door, a little of the front
door, and the rear right wheel arch. The other driver was talking on a cell
phone. Fortunately for all concerned, no one was hurt (though my wife was
sore for a few days), and the other driver (a school bus driver! :-O) had
good insurance. The body shops totaled the Metro. The fault was completely
that of the other driver.

We were trying to figure out what to do. We have Guac, a 78 bus, which runs
well, but has the usual limited heat supply (we live about 60 miles south
of the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field). The Metro ran great, using no oil.
We were thinking we'd do some junkyard combing and pick up a new rear door
for it.

Then I saw Len's ad....

Last summer we took our first long trip in Guac, to Wyoming and back, an
account of which I posted to the list. We really loved it. Every time that
I've seen a Westy since, I've tried hard not to covet it, since coveting is
a sin.

I read Len's ad early in the morning, and my wife had not gotten up by the
time I left for school (I'm a college professor). I left a note for her
about Len's bus. She was (and still is, being a sensible person) concerned
about the bus not running, but I emphasized the new engine (it's not even
properly broken in yet, having run 10 minutes before it stopped), the
soundness of the body, the coolness of the Westy stuff....

So the Saturday before last we loaded up the Metro (still drivable) for its
last trip with us, and road-tripped to Len's home in Fountain City, WI.
Fountain City is right on the Mississippi, about 40 miles north of LaCrosse
(probably best known as the home of Heileman and Old Style beer). Len and
Jan's house is on the side of a bluff. Jan has a beautiful terraced garden
on the side of the bluff, with many wildflowers and herbs, and the house
has a deck on one side from which you can see the river and estuary and the
eagles, hawks, and ospreys soaring high over the top of the bluff. The fall
colors were at the peak, so the drive and visit were spectacular.

We looked over the bus, which was exactly as Len had described. Some rust,
but very little for a Wisconsin bus that had actually been driven! Most of
the camper stuff was intact, with the exception of the clamp that holds the
pivoting table to the cabinet. And a brand new engine and clutch.

So we decided to buy the bus. And when we were getting into the Metro,
saying goodbye to Len and Jan, we saw an eagle flying high above us.

We didn't have the money at time, since we were going to receive the
insurance settlement the next week (the insurance company gave us $300 less
than we paid for it last spring). Our plan was to drive to Fountain City
(about 220 miles away) and tow Len's bus back to Fond du Lac.

I checked the list archives for towing advice and discovered that our best
bet was going to use a 2-wheel tow dolly (from U-Haul) and borrow a large
Buick with a V8 from a friend.

Early Saturday morning we left for Fountain City. Since the unloaded tow
dolly bounced around a lot, I decided to keep our speed to a maximum of 45
mph (after all, it was my friend's car!) even without the Westy. We arrived
in Fountain City at about 11:30am.

Len had the bus parked in a clearing in a mowed field right at the entrance
to Fountain City. It was a little tricky to get the dolly aligned with the
bus, but after some struggles we were successful. We were able to get the
bus up on the ramps of the tow dolly by me pushing and by Len repeatedly
engaging the starter with the clutch in. I realized what a great idea a
come-along would have been....

Then we needed to pull the bus onto the road. I was able to perform a
long-radius turn in the mowed field, but got hung up going a slight bump in
the field: tires spinning, etc. My wife and Len pushed, and we did the
winter rocking thing, and eventually got the car, dolly, and bus in one
piece on the road.

One thing we did not prepare for was having rear lights for the Westy while
towing. We realized, once we got the bus on the dolly, that it was
impossible to see the dolly lights if you were directly behind the bus.
This worried me, since the last thing I wanted was for someone to rear end
us, or for some Officer Friendly, who needed to fill his monthly quota, to
make an example of us (it was Oct. 31!).

Len followed us down the road for about six miles, and we stopped and
tightened the straps on the dolly, and bid farewell. We told Len that they
still had visitation rights, and that whenever we were in that part of the
state, we'd stop by. Len, by the way, is a great guy.

We found some towing lights at a Walmart just outside of LaCrosse. It was
very interesting trying to drive a car pulling a bus in a very crowded
parking lot, especially seeing as we could have used a sundial to measure
our acceleration (something I should be used to, driving a bus :-) ).

On the way home, we stuck to 45 mph, and had only two incidents of swaying.
All I had to do was take my foot off the gas and let the swaying stop. The
car's engine did not seem to strain, and we were very careful to accelerate
and brake gently. Actually the greater strain was when braking. We drove on
state roads (not interstates), and the most cars we had behind us at any
point was about four: very little traffic. Once we got home, we called the
friend whose car we borrowed, and he and I pushed our new bus into our
driveway.

I think the name of the new (for us) bus will be &quot;Easty.&quot;

Thanks to the list for providing all the support you do. To get this bus
running, I'll need more, since I haven't really tackled electrical problems
before.
