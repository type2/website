&gt;Need to know which fuel pump to use for a (single) carb'd 2.0 - I'm assuming
&gt;you can't use the FI pump (correct?). What are those of you running carbs
&gt;using on 2.0s?

Assuming you do not have the hookup for the mechanical fuel pump, you can 
use just about any electric pump that is designed for carbs and 12V.  I 
have one of the Facet pumps which are by far the most common and very 
inexpensive.  Buy two in case the first one dies.  :)  You can probably use 
it without a regulator, but you should check the pressure and make sure 
it's not over about 3psi.  The Facet pump is rather noisy so you will have 
to live with that or come up with some kind of isolated mount.
