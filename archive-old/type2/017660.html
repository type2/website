X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Well, Ulyseus the adventurous mango bus has been dormant for the winter
and is just now waking up see the &quot;rosy fingered dawn&quot; unobstructed by
an ugly blue tarp.  He has this Complete Idiot with a huge paper back
book pokin around at him, changing his oil, and adjusting his timing
etc... and even looking at those bearings.

So im in the process of re-placing my front wheel bearings.  I was able
to get all of the SKF, made in germany, bearings (4) and seals for
$100.00 cdn, probably $65.00 US. I was under the impression that these
german made bearings were hard to find but I guess I was wrong because
if they stock these in Winnipeg they must stock em everywhere.  I
realize I could have saved a couple bucks by ordering them but then how
could I be sure of getting German made bearings.

I am actually a little p'd off that the guy who sold me my bus repacked
the wheels with shitty bearings.  After I bought my bus I took it to the
garage where the seller (PO) worked as a mechanic.  My bus failed but no
mention at all was made about the faulty bearings, only that the swing
arm lever needed replacing.  So I went to a different VW shop to get the
Swing arm done quickly and the mechanic there said that my bearings need
to be looked at, and that he wouldnt pass my bus if it were up to him.
Fortunately it wasn't, so I returned to the first garage (where the PO
worked)  with my new swing arm bushings happily installed, they checked
off the form that the repairs had been made and off I went to get
licensed and insured.  But in the back of my mind echoed the words of
mechanic number 2: &quot;I wouldn't pass that bus.&quot;

Anyway - these brakes look very good - and these new bearings are ART.
