&gt; .... All in all though the type 1 engine is very simple to pull out.

Um... I thought that I had a T4 engine, in a T2?  Pancake?
 &gt;&gt;
'71 and back type 2; type 1 engine...
'72 and up type 2; type 4 engine...
'Course this is US spec...European type 2's would still have type 1

All of the above is general...And over the course of 30 years or so
anything short of a Merlin 'might' be back there... ;-)
