 Don't let the FI nazis on the list
&gt;keep you from making an objective decision - you've probably seen some
&gt;people on the list fiddle with their flaky FI endlessly - don't make that
&gt;mistake. *Using* your bus to travel is what it's all about.

I don't want to get into my political affiliations but I took interest in
the above statement.

I have been tabulating FI problems that have been queried on the list over
the last couple of years and I find that the statistics just don't uphold
the above statement.  In fact, I think if you checked closely, most
problems that were originally thought to be FI oriented were in fact not,
but were problems with timing, ignition, valves, etc.  The ones that were
FI oriented were mostly due to aging connectors.  In the last 22 years that
I have had a FI VW Bus, I've had only one problem that was due to a FI
Component...a stuck open injector due to a rusted gas tank.

&gt;From my research, the real problems that seem to be happening  on the FI
systems on the list are mainly due to aging harnessess and connectors.
This is not surprising as they have been rattling around in our engine
compartments now for up  to 24 years.  The Bosch FI system has nearly 100
connectors which could now be prone to rattle loose.  The key component I
have tallied that has failed on the FI system is Temp sensor # 2 and mostly
because of corrosion and looseness in its connection to the head. This part
is very inexpensive to replace, less tha $20.  The contact plate in the AFM
would be the next problem area.  This is due to age but also to dirty
engine compartments and increased friction. How many carburators do you
know that have not been overhauled several times in more than 20 years?

If you have been blessed with a bus that has been taken care of and has an
intact FI system, I think it would be folly to change to carbs.  First the
FI system runs at a much more economically.  I am less than 3000 miles now
into a rebuilt and tight engine yet my FI system is delivering 22-24 mpg on
the road.  Second, the Bosch FI system is not that tough to diagnose.  With
a multi meter you can test 7-10 contacts on the main harness and diagnose
the majority of problems a FI system can have.  The main problems are
maintenence.  Most sparatic symtoms are caused by loose fitting connectors.
Take a little time and tighten up your female plugs and I think most of
the problems will disappear.  A clean engine compartment has less friction
on the moving parts in the AFM, etc. Clean it up!  Third, check the fuel
mixture.  At your next emmissions check, see if your CO numbers are high or
low. (Or install a O 2 sensor and check it yourself)  If they're off ? Why?
Fourth, because you can control your fuel mixture better than with carbs
you also control engine wear.

The Bosch L-Jetronic FI system is much better than carbs if well
maintained.  D-jetronic  (type3s &amp; , early type 4s, and 914's) on the other
hand was a complete disaster.  Bosch learned from its mistakes and
L-Jetronic prospered.  This system is the basis for many of the modern  FI
systems on new cars today but with  computerised advance curve control.

I'm sure this thread will bring out people with contrasting points of view
but I think the facts speak for themselves.  In fact I would like to take a
little poll:

       Have you had any problems with your FI system this year? (75 up with
FI
       only obviously)



       What were the symptoms?





       How did you correct the Problem?



Please be as brief as possible in your discription and reply to me.  I will
tabulate and report to the list next week.

Have fun and thanks
