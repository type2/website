Ok all you parts hounds out there
I recently bought a 76 weekender to part out (it is way beyond repair and PO
was trying to sell it to junkyards)
anyway there is a component i cannot figure out what it is for.

so here is your description
It resides under the dash bolted to the top of the air vent by the drivers
left knee
it is a little black box approx  2in across ...1in deep...and 1in high with
a little red toggle switch on it
it also has 3 wires connected to it 2 blue?? and one brown
the brown one attaches to the circle of blade connectors on the back of the
instrument cluster

WHAT IS IT ?????
