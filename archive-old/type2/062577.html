&gt;Bob Whitby &lt;whitby_at_isthmus_dot_com&gt; laments the lack of compressed air to blow
&gt;out his carb &gt;during rebuild.

Go to a local auto shop which does air conditioner work.  They recharge
systems from throw-away tanks.  Law forbids refilling those tanks with
freon, but nothing says you can't scrounge the empty tank from them (I went
dumpster-diving myself) to use for compressed air.

JC Whipme has a valve/hose gizmo (I think about $8.95 plus tax and
shipping) designed to be used with the aforementioned tank.  They say so in
their catalog, anyway.  You may have to purchase separately another nozzle
to enable you to &quot;shoot&quot; the air rather than just use it to inflate tires.

Screw it all together and take it to your local service station's air pump
and charge it up.  Presto: compressed air.
