Subject: Re: [T2] BINZ bus road help - Covered!

All, I got a failure on the send the first time so I'll try again.

I just met up with Dan and Matt and we hooked him up with the Love Bug
here in Port Hueneme.  Jason at Love Bug was able to provide him with
some hardware to cover for now.  He's going to be looking for solid
shafts up the road, but at least he's got some spares for the stock
valve train for now.

They're heading for Santa Barbara for the night.  Then on to San
Francisco tomorrow.
