Hi Volks,

while David is of course correct, I'd like to add that Porsche also 
makes waterboxers lately.  FWIW, the usual terms we colloquially use 
in Germany translate to &quot;waterboilers&quot; or &quot;waterpumpers&quot;, and 
&quot;airhowlers&quot; respectively.  All in good fun of course, I own both 
flavours myself.

Back on the subject of engine conversions, a pal of mine from 
Sieversen near Hamburg converts Bays to the Vanagon/Rabbit Diesel 
engine.  He already did a dozen or so, semi-professionally.  The 
radiators are hidden in the engine compartment, so that the only 
optical change to the bus is the exhaust.  If any of you are 
interested, p-mail me for information (he's not online yet).

&gt; Not exactly.  &quot;Water&quot; means water.  &quot;Boxer&quot; means a horizontally
&gt; opposed, or flat (180 degree V) engine.  I guess because the pistons
&gt; appear to be boxing with each other, in a backwards sort of way.  The
&gt; only common waterboxer engines (that I know of anyway) are the 83.5-91
&gt; Vanagon and the Subaru engines.  All of the other water cooled engines
&gt; are just plain &quot;Water&quot;.  

Yours,
    Erik.
