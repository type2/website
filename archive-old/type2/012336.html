Scott,

I use Netscape 4.04, and everything looked fine! Some
of the old farts around here *refuse* to upgrade their
browsers, even though it's free and easy. So if they
can't view newer html documents, it's their fault, not
yours! Most of these older browsers cannot handle the
latest java applets and/or Flash animations,
either....let alone sound files.

I've designed several web-sites, and I currently have
5 browsers on my computer to check out what I've done
(*any* page will look different through just about
every one;-).

I *did* get several java-script error messages, but
that's probably a case of my using an older browser (I
can't stand the AOL-ish look of the newest
Netscape;-). I will p-mail you with the error-alerts I
got, just in case there is a real problem.

I liked the way you matched the color behind the
nav-bar to the main color in the photos... As an
artist, it's nice to see sites created with color in
mind!

One last thing.... You might want to consider using
smaller, thumbnailed images for faster loading. I have
DSL, so it's no problem, but I also remember the
bad-old-days of 28.8 dial-up...no joy.


Jaime

&gt; Hello everyone.
&gt;   After many long hours I have finally got my new
&gt; web page up. It is
&gt; completely different from the old site and has a
&gt; slightly different address.
&gt; Please go take a look and see what you think. I
&gt; still need to add some
&gt; better pictures of the 71 Westy and the Vert, but it
&gt; is a start. And just so
&gt; you know, it was completely created useing only MS
&gt; Notepad and a little
&gt; photo editing from Adobe photo shop 5.0. There is a
&gt; nav bar that will take
&gt; you to the type 4 conversion page and one for the 71
&gt; westy, the other pages
&gt; are Bug and a for sale page with nothing on it
&gt; currently. 
&gt;   Please let me know if something does not work
&gt; right or needs correcting.
&gt; Today is its first day up and running.
