Richard,

To my knowledge, I have never seen a sealed(or non sealed) 
automotive type battery where the posts(not the side connect Gm kind) used 
anything but something that looked like(and felt like) lead 
mixed with something else. 

For the record, I haven't seen an Optima....but every deep cycle sealed 
battery that was ever replaced in the gigantic UPS's that we had at work
had the same kind of post on it as a regular car battery.

If it is sealed, then you probably don't need the inhibitors, it's just 
that I have found that for 99  cents they work well on regular lead acid 
non-sealed batteries like most cars have.

And I am betting 1 good virtual 6 pack of german beer that Mike has a 
normal &quot;un-sealed&quot; lead acid battery in his bus.  In which case, his new 
expensive battery cables will benefit from the 99 cent corrosion 
inhibitors.

Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt;umm...yeah, you mean like a sealed optima type battery?
&gt; 
&gt; Optima is AGM, Dry Cell is a different style of auto battery.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; don't forget to add the 99 cents for the red and green felt corrosion 
&gt; &gt; inhibitors as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't requiring those depend on the composition of the battery posts?
