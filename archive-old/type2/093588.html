Hey Steve,

That sounds logical to me, to be geared low for that HP (or lack there of).
From what I have read the diesel Vanagons are slower than splits, ouch.  

I am sure the R&amp;P could be swapped out to something a little more interstate
friendly :)

Just to clarify I have no real interest in this bus, but please someone else
pick this one up.  (once I figure out this bio-diesel thing on a cheap
beater I might try and find a diesel Vanagon Westi - LHD)

Take Care,
Adrian

Adrian,

The good news is... RIGHT ARM!!!!  Yeah!!! biodiesel will work as
described!!!  The bad news is that even wiht the larger engine and turbo,
you still *can't* &quot;cruise with ease.&quot;  The limit on the Vanagon diesels is
not the engine, but the trans.  To get the low HP original ngine to work,
the Diesel transmissions are geared LOW!  Whatever higher HP engine you
plan to install, if you plan to do more than 55 for extended periods, plan
on a new higher-geared transmission!!!!
