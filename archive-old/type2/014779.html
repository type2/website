I did not know that the shelf was an option. Anyone have any picture of the
net? I have never seen the net, just the clips for it.

My 68's closet has lever clamps in front and a single thumb screw in back.
Also, it has the net in back rather than a shelf and the jumpseat pocket is
an oval.  My paneling is mahogany-looking with a very straight, tight grain
(headliner, cabinets, driver-side wall, sliding door, rear hatch hinge
cover), mustard vinyl throughout the rear, white seats up front.

Also, mine had the hole in the floor for the drain pipe but it had no
cabinet there.  I got one out of a 73.  The drain pipe is not in the same
place (had to cut a new hole).  Also my 68 has no vent in the roof for the
sink.  I have seen early Westys with a no-vent drain.

John
