&gt; 
&gt; &gt; hi, I have a 71 westy that is going to trade her 38amp generator for a
&gt; &gt; nice 55 amp alternator.
&gt; I assume you have a stock 34 pic 3 carbuerator.  you may need to grind down
&gt; the side of the alternator a bit for the accellerator pump connecting rod to
&gt; clear the alternator body.........

Actually, the 34PICT3 carb has the proper accelerator pump linkage available
for it so you don't have to grind clearance on the alternator.  Basically what
it does is reposition the actuating lever to the top and pulls on the pump arm
rather than pushes.  For sure, stock on the '73 bugs.  Maybe earlier.  Don't
know when they started putting alternators on the bugs (&quot;Small Wonder&quot; doesn't
say, and I'm too lazy to go out to the garage to get into the Bentleys) but
any alternator equipped bug should have the correct carb.  Might want to go
boneyarding before you fire up the Dremal.  You also might want to call the
Friendly Local VW parts Counter.  That's where I found the last one I needed.
