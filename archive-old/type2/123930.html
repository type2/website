Subject: Great Find?

&gt; And, is the Porsche engine any better or worse than the stock that FI I 
&gt; have in my current westy?

I'm just finishing a 74 Safare that my friend put a Porsche 914 engine into 
before he gave it to me. According to my friend, the Porsche would have a 
stouter cam than the VW. Takes a little getting used to the oil filler and 
dipstick locations. Others have told me the metals in the Porsche are better 
than VW, but I haven't heard any substantiation on that. Any other opinions? 
Better head flow or anything else different on the Porsche?

John
