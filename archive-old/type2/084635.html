I think it presumptuous to assume malice. Very likely just ignorance. If a 
client came to my shop with such a vehicle, he would have to pay for an 
initial inspection of the whole vehicle before acting on any advice as to 
where to start spending money. It could well end up that 2 hours of time 
will result in a report of $5000 needed to make it safe and reliable. Pay 
for the inspection and bail out if that's what this reality says to you. Or 
pay for the inspection and go forward with a plan and budget to get the job 
done. In either case, skilled inspection comes first, and before 
negotiating any purchase is certainly best to reduce the risks of assumed 
value.

Everything on a T-II that has been sitting for 7 years must be assumed to 
be bad until confirmed as good. Assume the worst, or verify the actual 
conditions and actual costs to rectify defects. Never assume it will only 
cost $xxx to get it safe and reliable for use.

Only a $500 asking price in no way guarantees value received unless the 
only value of interest to you is subjective.
