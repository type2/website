Subject: [T2] Cheap Door Seals!

Just a note to say that I have received a new shipment of aftermarket
sliding door and rear hatch seals for '68-79.  These are Mexican
aftermarket, and are half the price of the genuine ones. I got some of these
last year, and they sold out very quickly to people who were looking for a
cheap way to seal their bus over the winter but didn't want to spend the
bucks for original equipment.  This is the first time I have been able to
obtain them since then, and I only have about 20 of each.

The Sliding Door Seal is $24.95 (part number 211 843 792BOR).
The Rear Cargo Hatch Seal is $39.95 (part number 211 829 193EOR).

For those who want O.E. quality, I do have the same items in original
quality for $47.50 and $85.45 respectively (the former a European made
repro; the latter genuine VW).  They are pricier but the fit and finish is
definately better. Those part numbers are the same but without the &quot;OR&quot; -
211 843 792B and 211 829 193E, respectively.

To finish off the job, I have genuine Volkswagen front door seals for
$39.90/pair (VW/Brazil) or $179.95/pair (NOS German; expensive but best
available).  Nobody else in the U.S. has either genuine VW seal.

Prices include listmember discount where applicable. Order via the web or
toll-free at 1-866-BUS-DEPOT.
