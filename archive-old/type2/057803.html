Subject: Re: Timing and carb mysteries....New thoughts?

Hey all...

Ok, some more background.  Today, having all this voluminous information
at hand, I went back to my fuel system in my 71.

I statically timed it at 5 deg. ATDC.  Started the engine and it ran
pretty roughly.  Adjusting the idle mixture and idle speed screw didn't
appear to help.  Dwell is 48 degrees.

Hooked up my strobe light, plugged both vacuum hoses (the one on the rear
of the vac. advance goes to the intake manifold, I was wrong.  The hose
from the front of the vac. advance goes to the carb.) and the degree wheel
read 10 deg BTDC.  I thought this was pretty odd.  

Shouldn't the light and the static timing have the same reading at this
point?

The engine is running even rougher now, so I loosen the dizzy bolt,
keeping the strobe on the pulley wheel, and move the dizzy to try and find
a spot that runs better than it is.  That spot doesn't seem to exist.  In
addition, I can't get the timing to stand still.  As soon as I set the
dizzy to 5 deg ATDC at idle, the engine begins to die down and cut out.  I
then advance the timing to bring the engine back to life, and it begins to
rev and shake and advance to 30-40 deg. BTDC.  So any place I try to lock
down the timing with the strobe, it won't stay and is all over the place.

Oye.  

I tried to set the total advance at about 2000 rpms, but again, the timing
wouldn't stay in one spot for me to lock it down, and when I did lock it
down, it would drift off the mark...

So as of now, I've static timed it to 5 deg ATDC, where it runs rough.  I
then advanced it several degrees (not sure how much, not more than 10)
until it seemed to idle evenly.  

That is where I am now.  It backfires when I let off the gas or downshift,
and is knocking a bit, although the power is good and it runs pretty
smoothly.

So I guess my questions after all of this are:

Should I just go with the static timing and then play the advance by ear,
as I'm doing now.  I have to admit this doesn't make a perfectionist like
myself particularly happy..:)

Is it normal to have such trouble setting the timing via a strobe with
both vacuum lines plugged?  There was literally no way to hold a
particular spot on the wheel.

Why are the static timing and strobe timing settings so different?

When I look at the rotor while setting my static timing, it is ever so
slightly to the right of the notch in the dizzy lip (#1, TDC), on the #4
side, not the #2 side of the mark. Is this actually BTDC and somehow my
wheel is wrong, or does this sound right?

Thoughts?

I also took the carb off this morning and CAREFULLY cleaned it.  Unscrewed
every jet, sprayed some carb cleaner and cleaned out all the ports.  Not
too dirty in general, but I wanted to make sure there wasn't any dirt in
any of the jets.  Float and needle valve are good.

Plugs, condensor, rotor, cap, wires, and points are all new.

I'd love to hear some more thoughts about what I am doing wrong or what
could be occurring to facilitate this dilemna...:)  Sorry if this thread
is boring people to tears, but if I don't get my methodology right or
successfully troubleshoot this problem, there will be many more days of
frustration in the years to come...:)

Cheers,

Tom

&gt; If it has two hoses coming off of the canister, then it's a double.
&gt; Neither one should be going to the exhaust manifold  The lower/inside one
&gt; is retard and should be going to the intake manifold and the upper/outside
&gt; one is advance and should go do the carb.
