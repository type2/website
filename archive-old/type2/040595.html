Subject: VW Canvas still around?

 Hello all!

 My bus should be back from the body shop in a month or so.  That means itll
 be time to put the whole thing back together again soon.  I have a huge
 pile of parts sitting in my house including new rubber all around and some
 misc engine goodies.  I do need some new poptop canvas to replace the ripped
 stuff I removed six months ago.  I was planning on going with PLF, but 
 this talk latley has got me thinking whether I should find a saffer place
 to send my hard earned green.

 I remember a place called VW Canvas in Texas, but I cant get their Web site
 to work.  Anybody know if their still around?  Anybody got their canvas from
 them want to tell me how it worked out, quality and buisness wise?

 Thanks
