Subject: [T2] 71 manifold question.

    I am working on a 71 bus. I am converting it back to a stock carb from 
duel carbs. I was not able to find a 71 intake so I am missing the vacuum 
port for the breaks. THe manifold I am working with only has one small vac. 
part on the side. In the past I have drilled in to the manifold, tapped out 
a hole and screwed in a brass fitting to use for the breaks. I am wondering 
what other people have done when confronted with this same problem.
