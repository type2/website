Subject: [T2] Magnets



Cow magnets are good for cows and readily available, which is probably why
Berg recommended them.  I don't think I would want that brittle ceramic
magnet material loose in my engine if it got rattled around.

&gt; &gt; mentioned doing this not too long ago. Before you sell out good money for
&gt; &gt; weak magnets, check out this website.
&gt; &gt; http://www.wondermagnet_dot_com/dev/main.shtml They sell Rare Earth Neodymium
&gt; &gt; magnets cheap. These magnets are extremely strong. Their size is deceiving.
&gt;
 These are much better for picking up ferrous particles.  Put them near the
 oil pickup and you'll have a good situation.  Do _not_ attach them to the
 oil pickup tube or you could have the situation where iron filings get
 held inside the tube and then released when the magnet is removed,
 Probably the best place is to secure the magnet to the oil strainer.

 _Don't_ use a magnetic drain plug, at least on type 1 engines.  They are
 too long, interfere with the strainer, and are in a &quot;dead&quot; zone for oil
 flow anyway

&gt; &gt; You can easily injure yourself if you don't give these magnets the respect
&gt; &gt; they deserve.  They're not toys for your 6 year old. They're not toys for
&gt; &gt; your 36 year old either, but that person is on their own.

 True enough.  They are great toys for 44 year old physics teachers,
 though!  My students love it when I come in with multiple &quot;piercings&quot;
(ears, tongue, nose, cheeks, hands) all
 courtesy of these magnets.  They will attract each other well enough to
 stick to opposite sides of your hand!

 George
