Subject: Re: [T2] My 69 bus has a bad oil leak!

(The Blackhams) sends:

&gt;&gt; I have a 1969 bus, 1600cc engine, with a bad oil leak behind
&gt; the crankshaft pulley.  As you can imagine the location of
&gt; this leak causes a spray of oil everytime I drive my car.  I
&gt; have tried several things that have been suggested to me
&gt; such as: swapping the crankshaft pulleys (haven't tried a
&gt; brand new one though), doing a new ring job, replacing the
&gt; oil pump gaskets, and I've even tried stopleak.  Anything
&gt; I'm missing?  Help me out before I burn my engine up!

There's an oil deflector ring at that end of the crankshaft on a Type 1
engine; assuming it's there, that part is no fun to replace since you need
to split the case to do it, and I'm not really sure if it's necessary.
Excessive end play could keep this from seating properly.

I'd like to know if this is above or below the tin--above, maybe the oil
slinger and possibly (longshot) the oil pressure sensor--if it's cracked at
the base, maybe but not likely. Below the tin? Oil pump, oil slinger, galley
plug, crack in the case...
