&gt; A few things to consider:  These will be 15&quot; wheels, and require 15&quot;
&gt; tires....195..what...70's? maybe 65's? Not sure...Chances of finding a
&gt; load C or load D tire in that size is probably pretty slim.  Or move up to

Continental CT22 in a 205/65/15. A beautiful tire that I'll fit to my 6x15
Fuchs. They're reinforced and are rated at 99T (1706 lbs). I believe that's
what the Eurovans are wearing these days. But for a 205, I believe 6&quot; wheels
are a minimum.
