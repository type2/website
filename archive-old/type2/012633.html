Subject: Rivera Question (hey wetwesties members)
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hey volks,
i just recieved an email from a guy who stopped by my
website and had just purchased a vanagon with a
Riviera camper conversion.  his question to me was:

&quot;I have recently bought a vanagon with a Riviera
conversion. I was wondering about a good source
for used parts. the bearings that sit in the tracks of
the poptop are mostly broken. These are the bearings
that the support arms for the poptop. I can have a
mahine shop make them but that is expensive. Any
suggestions would be helpful.&quot;

so i was wondering if anyone could answer his question
and thought that possibly some of the wetwesties
members might have a lead on a junkyard in the
northwest where he could get the parts used maybe? 
any help is appreciated.  just reply back to me and i
will forward it on, im happy to recieve any riviera
info anways.
thanks everybody
shelby
