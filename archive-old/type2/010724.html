Subject: [t2-VB] B-quiet. A Note On SndPrfng Products...
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I visited the website 
 http://b-quiet.server101_dot_com/cascade.html

and this stuff seems to be made specially for putting on the inside of cars 
or at least in their applications. My guess that if I took out all the 
interior of my 70 westy and put this stuff everywhere with 2 layers by the 
rear seat where the engine noise seems to come from I could listen to the 
radio and not have to turn it up to Max when I am going 65 mph.

Has anyone on the list used these products, BTW brown bread seems best.
