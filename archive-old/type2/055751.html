Thank you for searching the archives first.

&gt;1) worn/loose throttle plate bushing (several listees report this)

Yeah, it's a problem.  Contrary to what some say, I never found that it
made much of a difference in how the engine runs.  I was still able to get
mine to run and idle well even with really loose throttle bushings.  The
main problem with the worn bushings is if you ever step on the gas pedal
when the bus isn't running, the accelerator pump will squirt fuel all over
the throttle plates and it will run out through the worn bushings and down
the outsides of the manifolds.  This makes the engine compartment smell
like gas, and is of course a fire danger.

&gt;3) linkage too short for engine (?) (Eric Keppel)

I was able to simply bend the crossbar mounting brackets to take up the
slack when I went to a 2-liter from a 1.8 with the stock carbs.

&gt;4) bad/missing enrichment/lean-out resistor unit (Jim Thompson)

I have one, but it doesn't do squat that I can tell.  I wouldn't worry
about not having it.

&gt;Is there anything else for which I should be on the lookout?

Yeah, the idle shutoff solenoids.  They tend to clog and malfunction.
Also, check all of the threads in the carbs for strippage.  Especially the
idle air shutoff solenoid threads.

&gt;Mine seem
&gt;to have worn throttle plate bushings, though I have nothing to which to
&gt;compare them.  The linkage feels alright to me, and I won’t be able to
&gt;tell if it is too short until I get the heads back on my 2.0 liter (I’ve
&gt;got .090 cylinder spacers,

Yowza.  If you have dished pistons you're looking at around 6.7 to 1
compression with those huge spacers.  You can order thinner ones from Rocky
Mountain Motorworks for about $10.  I'm running .030's at the moment which
gives me 7.0 to 1.

&gt;but the heads have been flycut at least once,

Hmmm... what I just said may not mean much then.

&gt;The manifolds for one pair are longer than the others, apparently to
&gt;make room for the EGR piping mounts

The short manifolds are 72's and the longer ones with the EGR pipe mounts
are '73's.  I removed the EGR from my bus and blocked off the holes in the
manifolds.

 -- which reminds me, do I want to
&gt;keep this piping, minus the connections to the heads, as a balance tube?

No, you should already have two balance tubes - the one that your brake
booster is hooked up to and the one for the idle circuit that goes across
the center of the engine.
