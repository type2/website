Hi Volks!

How do you folks determine how much torque you have on the castellated nuts
on the rear axles?  I believe that 295 ft/lbs is what's recommended, but the
torque wrenches I've seen only go to 250 and are the adjustable clicker
kind, which were not recommended by the list a few weeks ago.

I know I can guess with the length of the breaker bar and cheater bar
combined times the weight on the end, but frankly it worries me because you
never really know how much weight your putting on that thing.  Your either
on it completely (your total weight) or just kinda on it (some weight).  How
do you figure it out?

BTW, what does YMMV stand for?

Thanks again!
