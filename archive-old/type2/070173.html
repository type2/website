&gt; 
steve has a '64 crew cab and the first line of Id plate reads:
&gt; 
&gt; 29 0
&gt; 
&gt; The VIN is 265050543. Does this mean my car was made on 10.29.64?
&gt; - - -
&gt; the  265 in the vin means  a 65 truck
&gt; 
&gt; the first line suggests an oct 29th production date
&gt; 
It is a '65. I said '64 because I thought a manufacture date of 10/29 meant a

'64 model date. It has push-in buttons but the previous owner said it had a
40 Hp 
engine. Doesn't this VIN suggest a 50 HP?

- - - a bus buildt oct 29 64 is still a model year 65 bus (truck), 
65s usually came with an H case 1500cc motor,  but that doesn't have to
relate at all to what it might have 30 years later.
