If you haven't taken a look at Boston Bob Donalds' operation,  then
you may be missing a rebuilder who is highly regarded on the
List......  and he is in your backyard.  Check out

www.bostonengine_dot_com

or email   bostneng_at_fcl-us_dot_net

and let me know what you think.

&gt; In the shopping mode for a rebuilt engine, my mechanic has used and
&gt; suggested Strictly Foreign in Grants Bend, Oregon.  Any one know of
them
&gt; or have good or bad experiences?  I am also considering Mark
Stephens,
&gt; based on the feedback I have seen on the list.  Someone had recently
&gt; posted about a guy he used on Long Island which he was very pleased
&gt; with.  Does anyone have that info?  It is not in the archives yet.
Any
&gt; one want to suggest another to consider?  I am on the East Coast in
New
&gt; Hampshire.
