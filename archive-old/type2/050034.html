Hungry little thing from what I can see.

&gt;It's likely that the plug is lying in the tin under the crankshaft pulley,
&gt;or on the engine somewhere around the carburetor.

I looked all around in there, but did not think to look under the pulley; a 
logical place to fall.

So, I'll find that plug, or I'll increase Casper's value by a dime.
While I'm at it, I'll make two plugs;
keeping one for a spare down the road when NewBus decides to do the same 
thing some day.
