[...] I've had this problem several times in the past, especially with radials.
They tend to develop a &quot;set&quot;, as a result of bad alignment or other suspension
problems, and will not roll straight after that.  New tires (after correcting
the alignment problem) are the best way to correct the situation, although
moving the problem to the rear makes it less noticable, as you found out.

&gt; I have owned my bus for two month, and during that time it pulled hard to
&gt; the right. I had the usual problems with trying to find someone who would do
&gt; an alignment (too old, don't do VWs, can't see any way to adjust camber
&gt; etc.) Today I talked to an independent tires and alignment guy who said he'd
&gt; at least tale a look. I swung the bus in front of a bay and explained again
&gt; that it pulled hard to the right. He said he would bet me $10 that it was
&gt; the right front tire. I had never heard that a tire could cause the pulling.
&gt; I asked him how he knew and he said he heard me pull up and that after 17
&gt; years of tires and alignments only, he could literally hear when a car was
&gt; out of alignment. I took his bet. He explained that what he intended to do
&gt; to diagnose the problem was switch the front tires, left to right, right to
&gt; left. He said he expected that the bus would now pull *left* or drive
&gt; straight. The tech took the car for a ride and when he returned he said only
&gt; one word. &quot;Tire&quot; The tires were rotated, front to back, back to front. He
&gt; charged me $25, and when I asked him about the $10 bet, he declined and with
&gt; a knowing twinkle in his eye said one word: &quot;Experience&quot; Guess I gained my
&gt; fair share today.
&gt; The bus tracks nearly perfectly now (slight pull to *left!*)
