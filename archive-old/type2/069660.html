&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Unofficially, I have always been under the impression that the corner
&gt; &gt;windows were last seen in the 1963 model year. 21 windows were
&gt; &gt;&lt;unfortunately&gt; the *(US) max starting in '64. So much for the '66 23 that
&gt; &gt;was recently FS.
&gt; 
&gt; I myself always thought this was the case (and still do).  BUT there is a VW
&gt; *guru* at home in 
&gt; Aus (he owns the only barn door deluxe I've ever seen - at least until I go
&gt; and
&gt; check out Thom's) who blindly swears that the extra two rear corner windows
&gt; were available as a factory *option* from 64-67.  He even gets *quite* excited
&gt; about it - would anyone care to comment?  
&gt; 

To add fuel to the flame as we go merrily about the mulberry bush ;)
...and I have been meaning to dig out this reference since the last
time this debate aired...  In one of my VW Bus history books, I
vaguely recall a short remark that a &quot;special&quot; or &quot;limited&quot; run of
samba's with the rear corner windows was made in 1967 to mark the end
of the split-window busses [this could be the same tidbit to which
your local &quot;guru&quot; is referring]...I almost believe that this was in
one of the Schiffer books on the VW transporter [of course this
doesn't mean that it is accurate].  If I cannot find the reference,
then maybe it is time for a letter to the museum in Wolfburg.

Bugs &amp; Things &amp; Splits...Oh, my!
