&gt;the running temp on the head at 60MPH is around

I've never used one of these and know very little about them, but I've 
been told that the temperature that is reported isn't what is 
important.  What is important is knowing the range it should read when 
the bus is in god working order.  In other words don't live and die by 
the numbers, but know what the normal range is for your bus and that 
gauge.  Did i mention I know nothing about these devices really?
