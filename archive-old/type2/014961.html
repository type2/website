I've actually welded a hole in the gas tank of our '72 Bus, with the tank
out.  I vented the tank, blew it out with air and then filled it up with
water.  Before I hit it with the MIG welder, I did wave a propane torch
over the hole a few times to make sure there were no fumes lurking there.

If you are welding under the bus, with the tank in place, consider filling
it up with water, but as noted before, getting all the water later might be
a problem.  I'd also get a good strong fan and blow it under the bus for a
while to clear any trapped fumes out.

Even with all these precautions, it's not entirely safe...
