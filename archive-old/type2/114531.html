Subject: Nasty Valve Question

After 12 years of driving air-cooleds, I finally got stranded due to an
engine problem.  This is in my 74 914 2.0 not my bus, but the question at
hand would be the same for any type IV motor.

I was about to pull out of a parking lot (engine at idle) when my engine
died.  I re-started it and was met with a terrible clattering sound so I
shut it down immediately and had it flat-bedded back to my house.  I
restarted the motor one time and ran it for about 30 seconds - long enough
to decide the sound was most likely NOT a thrown rod (I've heard those and
this was not the same).  

I pulled the valve covers and found that the #3 intake rocker arm is WAY too
loose and the valve appears to be sitting too far in (open).  The valves in
these heads have always lined up very nicely (ie. you could lay a
straight-edge along the valve stems and they'd all be the same height).  Now
#3 is about 1/4 inch to far IN.  So something is preventing it from closing
all the way.

I'm guessing the valve seat came loose and got cock-eyed under the edge of
the valve and is holding it open.  Or maybe some foreign object got inside
the cylinder and is holding it open?  I checked the valve spring and it
appears to not be broken.

So, any suggestions before I drop the motor and pull the head?  I haven't
had to pull either of my motors (bus or 914) in over 5 years.  

Thanks!
