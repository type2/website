Depends on several factors (not necessarily in this order): 

1)  Compression ratio.  Usually anything over 8~8.5:1 requires higher 
octane rating.
2)  Ignition timing.  The further advanced the timing, the higher the 
octane needed.
3)  Fuel mixture.  The leaner the mixture, the higher the octance rating 
required.
4)  Elevation.  The lower the elevation, the more air available for 
combustion, requiring higher octane fuel.  (I know this is a very 
simplified explanation, but I think for practical purposes, it'll do.)

Probably a few other factors figure in here, but I think the above is 
pretty widely-accepted opinion.

The owner's manual from my '79 bus calls for 90 octane gas. 

When I had my '79 FI bus' engine rebuilt by Mark Stephens, I told them I 
wanted to run it on gasoline with an octane rating of as little as 85.  
My bus' engine now runs fine on 86~87 octane.  The elevation of my town 
is 3,750 feet, where the air is fairly thin.  My engine's compression 
ratio is now 8.0:1, but the combustion chambers were modified, using 
Stephens' &quot;zero deck height&quot; and &quot;head unshrouding&quot; technology.  They 
also balanced pistons/rod sets to within less than half a gram of one 
another and volumetrically balanced the combustion chambers.  

An alternative is to use cylinder spacers to lower the compression 
ratio, so that you can run the thing on cheaper gas.  With price 
differences of 10-30 cents or more per gallon between different grades 
of gasoline, buying the cheapest grade of gas can save you a lot of 
dough in a hurry.  In Mexico, some Pemex stations out in the sticks 
offer only 83~85 octane leaded gas (Nova), although premium unleaded 
(octane 90?) is becoming more widely available.
