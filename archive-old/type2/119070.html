Subject: Re: [T2] threaded tubes

&gt; 1973 1800? progressive carb...
on the pass. side head only, sticking out right next to the intakes, there are 2 tubes about 3 inches long
with threads at the end.  Mine are not connected..What are these?  Should they be connected? What am I
missing?

They are the air injection ports for a smog pump. #1 in this pic:

#10 connect to them. With nothing connected to them, you will have an exhaust leak.
If you don't have a leak, then somebody plugged them.
