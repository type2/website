I don't think the cabinets changed from '69 to '71. The thing that gets in
the way is the wood paneling that protects the rear hatch hinge. There's a
good 8 inches or so of &quot;wasted&quot; space back there - just about the length
that the cot bars stick out from the front.

&gt; [...]  Funny, in my 71, the child's cot fits in the top of the rear
&gt; passenger side cabinet, and does not stick out.  There is a plastic
&gt; snap-strap to hold it in place.  Is the cabinet in a 71 different from a
69?
