&gt;1. My mech has diagnosed an exhaust leak and I need to get a new exhaust
&gt;manifold

Sounds like you need to just replace the exhaust manifold to head gaskets 
(copper).

Also be sure that he takes a file and works the edge of the pipes (the side 
that seals to the gasket) until they are on the same plane. My bus warped 
the pipes and required new gaskets and the file job.

If yours are broken or rusted out, then that is another thing.

Basically climb under there and check his opinion - see why it's leaking. 
If it is just because the pipes are warped, it's a cheap fix - be sure he 
doesn't pull the exhaust studs out in the process - stripping the holes. 
You'll just need the copper gaskets.

My '78 has the oval exhaust holes, the '79 busses had the square holes.

As far as the other problem, I'm not sure - is the bus running rich or have 
you checked the timing? Vacuum leaks?

Take care.
