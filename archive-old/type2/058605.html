Subject: Ignition Coil: Normally hot?

Hi all,

I have an 81 Aircooled Westie.
I was recently doing some work on the engine and had the key turned to the
ON position ... I was checking the ignition wires and noted that the coil
was hot, almost too hot to touch. Is this normal? Is it a sign that the
coil is going to fail? Unfortunately my experience in this area is limited
and I hope one of you can advise me on the issue.
