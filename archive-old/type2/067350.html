&lt;&lt; Anyone have the numbers for Bus Boys, West Coast Metric, and anyone else
that
 might be helpful in getting individual enginge gaskets and cooling tin
seals? &gt;&gt;

Our number is 800-792-2697 - Very HEAVY phone traffic this week keep trying
or fax us at 916-244-0933 (FAX us your wish list and we'll make it come true
:-)).

WCM's phone 800-247-3202.  It's OK - WCM and BBI trades lotsa stuff back and
forth - prices are about the same, except some we're less expensive.
