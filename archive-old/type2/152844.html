Subject: Heavy Braking = Stall ?

Hello All,

Well, I've developed an irritating problem with my '73 Safare (1700cc, 
Dual Kadrons), where the last few times I have really had to put my 
foot into the brakes (steep hills and yellow lights etc) she will start 
to stall and if I dont catch it she stalls out completely. I had 
thought it was something to do with it not idling or dropping from 
higher RPM's but I tried revving it up and letting go off the gas 
suddenly, pushing the clutch in suddenly, but she wont stall, its ONLY 
when I really slow down in a hurry.

I wondered about my brake booster check valve, but I thought the 
symptom of that going was RPM increase when you stood on the brakes, 
not the other way around. To my mind thats the only cross over though !

Thanks in advance !
