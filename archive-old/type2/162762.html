Subject: Re: [T2] Shipping costs

Richard,

Correct you are!  Also noticed the same thing and I pick carefully
off that infamous auction site for vendors who charge *no* shipping or 
*exact* shipping.

After reading the other replies about shippingtimes and such, here is a 
really good one.

I got a large heavy package from a supplier on the west coast that was 
shipped on Thursday via USPS on Monday!  I'm betting that the cost was 
about the same as for UPS or others....

I've noticed local folks that need to send something minor have started 
using the USPS again instead of dropping it off....even tho gas prices 
have gone down.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Recently, I've noticed excessive shipping charges from part vendors.
&gt;
&gt; One order from CO was for a few rubber grommets that weighed no where near 1lb and the charge was $9.59. Another package came from GA was again a small plastic item and the charge was $10.50. Both times the part were put in a box that was too large but the parts arrived safe and sound.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else noticed this with their orders? I know the cost of gas is sky high but...
