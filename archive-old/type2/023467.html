Subject: Bearing With Me
To: Type2_at_type2_dot_com

Greetings to the List,

Thanks to many respondents I managed to get my CV joints on my 70 Bus all 
(they were all shot) changed out.  Messy job.  But it is well done 
nevertheless.  Again, thanks to those who took the time to give me a hand.

While I was doing the CVs I began to think about the rear wheel bearings.  If 
the CVs hadn't been touched in 70,000 miles it's pretty unlikely that the 
rear wheel bearings have had any attention.  Since I'm starting in on a 
complete brake job tomorrow I thought I might as well pull the rear wheel 
bearings and check 'em out.

So........here's the question.  Since I've never pulled the rear wheel 
bearings in a Type 2 before, are there any important pieces of info I should 
be aware of?  Tricks or tips from the old pros?  I checked out Chris Chubb's 
article in the library, but I'm always interested in what YOU have to say.  
Especially on something I have not tackled before.

Thanks!

Mike
