Subject: Re: [T2] FI or carb

When I first started on the list, I asked the same question since I had 
worked on vw's since 1966, but not FI.

Bottom line...a bus that sat for 8 years.

Went thru the test in the book sentence by sentence and all was 
well....except old gas had destroyed almost every part it touched.

4 new injectors
new pressure valve
new fuel pump
new hoses

The *real* bottom line.....
Being able to start the bus remotely if I want to, cause it is FI!

Starting it without touching the gas pedal....Priceless!(and modern)

Cheers, dave

&gt; It's easy to find faults with an old FI setup after installing a new  
&gt; set of carbs. My advice to those having problems with FI, is to strip  
&gt; the engine of the parts, test them individually, clean the contacts  
&gt; and rejuvenate it. Find the faulty part and replace it.

lots of snipping

&gt; 
&gt; The only downside I can see to the system is having to replace every  
&gt; part with a new one ($$$ cost) but I've never met or heard of anyone  
&gt; having to do this who had a competent mechanic.
&gt; 
&gt; The temp sensor II seems to fail after 100k miles of heat cycles but  
&gt; luckily it's a $12 part.
