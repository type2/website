Subject: Problems/Questions about 71 DP
Content-Disposition: inline

I just purchased a 71 Westy, and I have a few questions.  The engine runs pretty good, except that I get a lot of sputtering and back-firing upon decelleration.  When I let off the gas while slowing down, the engine sputters and pops.  What can I do to correct this?

Another thing I've noticed is how high the final drive is.  When I hit about 50 in 4th, the engine is just screaming.  It feels like it needs a 5th gear.  I have never had this problem with a type I/II engine before.  What is up?

Thanks for your help,

Bryan
