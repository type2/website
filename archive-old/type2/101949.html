Subject: Re: [T2] FI fuel pump failing?

Hey Richard,

That is what I was thinking. I have heard of the line
cloging or being stoped up before it reaches the
charcoal filter. Either that or the filter becoming
stoped up. Its was just a wild guess that would be
easy to check before he bought a new pump. Thanks!
Have a great day!

&gt; Do that matter with a FI tank that circulates the
&gt; gas all the time?  It
&gt; breathes through the tubes that go to the charcoal
&gt; canister.
