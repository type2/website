Barry's tale of the homemade thread chaser reminds me of what I have found 
as an alternative for cleaning up a spark plug thread. First, I always use 
the VW double-ended socket that came with my van that serves both fir the 
spark plug function and for the wheel nuts. The beauty of this tool is that 
it is long enough that when you put a plug in the socket and direct it thru 
the tin you can't cross thread it. And when the thread gets cruddy or needs 
chasing, I discovered that a K-D thread chaser (#730, combination 14/18 mm) 
fits neatly in the wheel nut side of the tool and thus you get a 14 mm 
thread chaser with the same &quot;always on-axis&quot; feature. It is nearly fool 
proof (as I can validly testify).
