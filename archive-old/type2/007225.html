Subject: Installing Alloy wheels

Hello all!

     O.K. There has been others asking on how to install alloy wheel on
there bus so I will tell you how I'm doing it on my 79' bus, 

     What we all know is that the alloy wheels are wider in the mounting
area of the wheel, so the wheel stud is to short to put the lug nuts on
properly. So I found out that the stock wheel studs are 14mm, with a 1.5
thread pitch, and 35mm long, so I went to my FLAPS and found a stud that
is 14mm long, with a 1.5 thread pitch, and 45.4mm long, the only
difference is that the knurle(part that presses into the wheel hub) is a
tiny bit bigger than the original studs. The new studs were listed for a
late model chevy(just so you know). 

     So I am getting different hubs to take to the machine shop were
they will drill out the hub a little bit bigger, and then press in the
new, longer stud. That way if for some reason I want to go back to
original I can put my stock hubs back on and my stock wheels also. If
any questions feel free to ask.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed
