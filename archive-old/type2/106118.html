&gt; Fine idea, but most pro thieves use tow trucks.  Now a hefty chain from

I figure mine is so distinctive that is the biggest deterent, I did get
towed once (illegally parked in a blizzard of all things) and I got
several phone calls before I knew it was gone, &quot;hey just saw your van on
the back of a tow truck!!&quot;
