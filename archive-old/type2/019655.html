Here's a picture of the brake pliers:

http://www.bobstools_dot_net/prd0497.htm

In this picture, the pliers would be in perfect position to pull the
spring down off the cover.  What you would do is open the pliers, put
the l-shaped part of the pliers over and behind the spring, and just
lever the spring down and off the cover.  Or... you can close the
pliers, pull out really hard and down, but that takes more effort.  not
the preferred choice :)

Then to put the cover and spring back on, you put the cover on, bring
the spring up a little(so you can fit the pliers under it), flip the
tool over (from the orientation in the pictures), hook the l-shaped part
under the spring and I found that if you just squeeze the handles
together, it acutally moves the spring up automatically on to the
cover.  Then just lever the spring back up into place.

Man, I could do this all day!  I actually wanted to test how fast I
could go from on to off and I think I was able to take the spring on and
off about 3 times in about 20 seconds.  that's one hot-roddin' tool! 
hahahaha

later,
MIke

&gt; &gt; Wow, I am excited.  In the past, I used to spend way too much time
&gt; &gt; trying at cursing to get those damned valve covers off.  Man, it was a
&gt; &gt; nightmare.  Well today, I was fishing through my toolbox and I looked at
&gt; &gt; the brake pliers tool and I thought I would use that to grab the spring
&gt; &gt; bar and pull it out and down.  Turns out, that tool has the perfect bend
&gt; &gt; and leverage to get the springs on and off in about 10 seconds.
