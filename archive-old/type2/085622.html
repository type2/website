--Guys, what exactly is the flame/heat switch? Are we talking about a sensing/detector type device?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Karl corrected me, the optional gas heater for 78 was the BA6. I don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;suppose anyone has one of these gems, do you?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have these on a couple of my busses and they are very complicated, to
&gt;&gt; keep them safe. This means there are many reasons they won't work. Parts
&gt;&gt; are very expensive and hard to find. When they do work, they work GREAT!!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It seems more people use the older, simpler heaters rather then the BA6.
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what year the bay got them but the aircooled Vanagons had them
&gt;&gt; too. Does anyone know of a substitute for a flameswitch on a BA6? They seem
&gt;&gt; so simple but I am afraid to just substitute a thermal switch since I
&gt;&gt; haven't seen one with a long probe like the flameswitch and I don't know
&gt;
&gt;have you looked into the flame switches used in home oil
&gt;furnaces.  haven't compared em but when I fixed my oil burner the switch
&gt;looked awfull similar
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; the temp the microswitch operates at. The testing in the BA6 manual just
&gt;&gt; says to heat it up to check operation. I've seen some thermal switches over
&gt;&gt; at meci_dot_com that have short probes, don't know how long they would last in
&gt;&gt; the exhaust stream tho.
