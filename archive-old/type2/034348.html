    Quilty!!!
About 2weeks ago I did the same thing, Opened my door (fine no problems) sat
my fat $ss down &amp; pulled the door shut, (took more effort this time) the
same as I ALLWAYS get in. Oooops to my dismay (as I heard &amp; I guess felt)
the travisty going on outside my bus. Looked out &amp; shining (to the metal)
the TOP of the fender of the vehicle beside me about a 1/8 inch deep &amp; 3/4
inch long scratch on the vehicle of said mentioned!!!  (it was a old beater,
think Monte Carlo, NOT to justify this action) But I got my fat $ss out of
there in a hurry!!!
    Since then I'm a little more cautious about my in &amp; out adventures!!!
Bernie.

see my bus at the link on the bottom of my page!!!
