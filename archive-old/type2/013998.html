&gt; I'd be wary of the one piece engine door seals.  I purchased one online
&gt; recently and it wasn't even close to the correct dimensions.  This thing was
&gt; way too large and I have the big door (1970).  If you do go the one piece
&gt; route and get a good one, I'd appreciate hearing from you about it.  I'd
&gt; still like to find a good one piece seal.

The 4 piece ones are a sort of hard plastic but the soft one (I think) is
the soft closed cell foam type. I think Id be happier modifying a foam one
by cutting and regluing with permatex weatherstrip adhesive than I am
with the harder 4 part one
