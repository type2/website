&gt; Gee, I feel sort of like Ken Lay or Martha Stewart - That rule&quot; must be for

We should really start spreading some facts here,,,, There IS NO new rule for Westfalia installed propane cylinders

the regs clearly say EXEMPT!

This confusion will continue as people hear it sooooo many times they think it is TRUE...

IT is NOT TRUE.... Westfalia installed propane cylinders are EXEMPT!

And I have been told that they do NOT have a retest date either,, so YOU CAN refill a 30 year old cylinder that is permanently mounted horizontally on a RV...

I recommend you have a new valve installed if you can,, and use soapy water to check for leaks, But please keep telling the filling station attendants to check the regs if they tell you they can't
fill them..
