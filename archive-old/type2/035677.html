Subject: RE: Is there a 72 singlecab?

&gt; I need to buy a pickup truck soon so I can haul sheets of plywood
&gt; and other house remodeling materials.  My first choice would be a
&gt; 72 Single Cab to go with my 72 Campmobile.  Is there such a
&gt; thing.


Yes, but not officially in the U.S.  VW discontinued the sale of all trucks
in the U.S. after the 1971 model year, a situation that continues to date
(with the short-lived exception of the Rabbit pickup).
