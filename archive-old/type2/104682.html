Subject: Re: [T2] disposable propane bottles-leave on or not?

Which leads to a question- are you better off leaving the partially used
bottle on the appliance (lantern, stove, heater), or should you remove it?
On the heater (Coleman, where it screws behind the Heater Buddy) I leave it
in place but always wonder if the valve is better than the rubber valve of
the bottle inlet????


Has anyone besides me noticed that those disposable 16oz propane bottles
leak
after you use them once?
