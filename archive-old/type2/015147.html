Hey Volks!
I am very happy to be a part of this list as well as a first time Westy
driver! Anyhoo, here is my question. I'm looking to add some gauges,
specifically oil temp and pressure (air cooled new and scary to me), maybe
a volt meter, is there anywhere I can get gauges that would match? You
know, replace the speedo and such so all the gauges match? Also, is there
anything I can do to find a new steering wheel without doing the pick and
pull crawl? While I'm on a roll I would also like to replace the headliner
and side panels inside, which are made of a very thin wood panel. Anyplace
to get those or should I just make'em myself? One more thing, does anybody
want to buy the sink and fridge combo?It's in great shape but I needed the
space in the bus,it is just sitting now. Thanks alot.
