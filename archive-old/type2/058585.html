Subject: Strange 4-carb on type IV

Hi Folks...

Here's a strange one...a friend brought it over for me to play
with...wish I had the engine it came off....

FI lower bolt up with manifolds modified to accept 4, 30PICT-2 Solex
carbs....chokes removed...back carb linkage remodeled so they're both in
the middle...looks like it could work....

I plan to re-build the carbs, and update the linkage a bit......_dot_can't
wait to hear it run...

Will keep you all posted....reminds me of the Corvair 140s...damn I love
multiple carb engines....

Bye for now...Den.
