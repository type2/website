Subject: Industrial Engine reefer

    Ran across a guy that says that he has a VW powered Reefer for a semi
trailer!  For those of you who have the wrong idea of reefer this one is a
unit that would cool the inside of a semi trailer!   Anybody ever heard of
this or better yet a picture! I am going to follow up on it but wanted to
inform myself before I go look!
Rob
