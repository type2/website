The problem with getting into first sounds like linkage problem.  I had a
problem getting into second once with a '69 and solved it by doing two things.
1)lubricate all the points where the linkage may bind up between the lever and
the tranny... 2) Adjust the front shifter by loosing up the two bolts on the
base and moving it around a bit until it seems to work better.

The growling sound  may be a throw-out bearing..Cheap and easy to fix but
requires engine out.
