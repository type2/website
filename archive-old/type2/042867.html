Subject: Re: Vinyl Protectant

&gt; I know this will open up a can of worms, but...........
&gt; What might the general consensus be for &quot;stuff&quot; to protect dashboard 
&gt; vinyl with?
&gt; What ingredients do you look for?
&gt; What is Neats foot's Oil?
&gt; Bob Perring

Well, I know that there are a number of products out there that are
advertised as protectants, but some are definitely better than others. The
operating thory on all of them is to block UV and replace the mineral oils
that have evaporated.  Some of them replace with fairly low vapor pressure
substances (alcohols or light oils) which gives you an instant
improvement, but over the long term, sucks more mineral oil out of the
rubber/plastic and cause cracking if they are not constantly reapplied.
The product that springs instantly to mind is armorall.  When you first
apply it, it looks great, but over the long term, unless you keep it up,
it will cause whatever you have applied it to to dry up, fade and crack. I
would *never* let this stuff near my bus, but if you have started, by all
means don't stop!

I have heard good things about Zymol and also just plain glycerin.  It has
no UV component, but it will replenish the oils in your plastic.

Neet's foot oil may work, it is an oil after all, but it is really
intended for use on leather, not plastic. Sorry :-)
