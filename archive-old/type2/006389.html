 Has anybody ever put safari windows (or 1 big one) on a Vanagon? I've been
 thinking about that lately. Man would it be cool.... I need to take the
 windshield out soon anyway to fix some rust on the metal at the bottom.
 Would turning the stock windshield into safari be feasable? Maybe with 3 or
 4 clamps at the bottom. I dont think I'd have it open at highway speeds,
 just cruising around town ya know. Any ideas, suggestions?
