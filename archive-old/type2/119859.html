&gt; I have a newly acquired '74 Micro... Just spent the weekend tearing it
&gt; apart for a resto and found some unsalvageable parts.  I have vent
&gt; windows in both the driver's rear window sections which are very rusted
&gt; at the bottom.  I need the frame to bus and the frame to glass, are
&gt; these only available used?  Any suggestions on where to find them?

In the southwest of the United States or in north Africa for Europeans.
The vent wing window frames are universally rusty and appear to have been
manufactured at the same plant that produced the pre-rusted &quot;Things&quot;  I
have no experience with current production Brazillian buses and do not
know if new frames are available at all.

                             OOK!
