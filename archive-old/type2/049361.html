Just a quick announcement that I finally go the '67 moving under its own
power.  And it is not quite a year since I acquired it, which means that
while I am (as usual :-) behind schedule, I am ahead of my own
expectation.  It only ran for ~100 feet (50 back and 50 forward), but did
not pop out of either reverse or first (which in a splitty of unknown
condition is a big win :-)  Now, to get it titled in my name and off to
Kelly in NC!  (Kelly, expect me some time in January/February)
