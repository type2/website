Subject: Re: [T2] cylinder head Vol

Your spread is about 5% which is acceptable in general compression
tests. Getting it closer would better balance your engine. Of course,
the question is where to remove material, and to do it slowly so as
not to overshoot. You might consider a minimum of three measurements
per cylinder to verify your numbers as it is possible to add
additional liquid without overflowing due to surface tension.

 My daughter and I measured the volume of each cylinder head to the
 machined portion.  The heads were leveled.  My daughter is a chemical
 engineer major so she should know how to measure volume, I hope!
