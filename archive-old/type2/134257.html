Subject: Re: [T2] Snap-on tools

&gt;I ordered a micrometer standard from Snap-on tools. $20.95, plus tax, plus 
&gt;9.95 shipping: $32.16 for a rod of metal 3&quot; long. Okay, I expected to pay 
&gt;for accuracy and I begrudged paying $10 to have the


21.00$ for a micrometer??? that sound ridiculous,.. im not sure you gonna
get &quot;accuracy&quot; with that. Must be made of plastic, from the worst indonesian
shop!!! at least find a good used one in a pawn shop, please!
