While ambling back to the pits, I thought of other data that might be
helpful in proving or disproving any particular theory or claim or
testamonial or existing data or memory that was in hand up to and including
prior nights research of the hot rod and bike magazines lying about the abode.

Back at the pits, Gas Master and crew were scurring to be ready to roll
their Gas Guzzler into the que. I notice briefly from before and now more
due to the interaction going on a fella who was leaning on the tires at the
side of the pit. At that moment it was huddle up time. The whole crew
assembled around this now acutely interesting fellow. It became quickly
apparent that this was the Man with Class behind the Master of Gas. While
cloistered where the spys couldn't hear, every now and then one of the crew
would go back and do some checking or tweaking on the car then return to
the huddle. This went on for some time till the whole crew went back to the
car for final pre-flight inspection of EVERTHING AGAIN, except for the Man
with the Plan and the Man with the Foot. 

At cue time for the row of cars to the line, the the Master of Gas heads
off with the crew and guess who stays in the pit and stifles a yahn? Of
course, the Man with Class. No strain. And you could see it in the crew as
well. No beheaded chickens amonst this group at all.

With everyone running off to see the run, I move myself in the position of
best probability of opportunity, near the cooler. Sho' nuf, the Man with
Class reaches striking distance of a potential pest like me and
acknowledges my presents with a pat &quot;howdy do&quot; and I return the favor as
lead in to my first question. I received about half the data I was after
till moments before the run when, with unhurried haste (i.e., CLASS), he
headed to the other end of the pit to watch the race.

I didn't risk losing my coveted position. I stayed put. Within 3 or 4
seconds of the green, the Man with Class turned and jumped down off the
pile of tires he'd climbed up on with a smile on his face. Competition
burned out on the line. The Master of Gas just shut down and coasted across
the line in the time of a 50 Chevy in-line 6 with Power Glide. No strain on
the car either, this time.

It took about another 5 minutes for the crew to make it back to the pit
which I used to obtain the last half of the data I was after and everthing
else that was volunteerd. Things like, Valvoline has more anti-foam
addative than others, particularly the racing oil, which has less
detergents than street oil, and high single weight vicosity oils have more
Dead Dynosaurs in them then his current favorite, Valvoline 20/50 racing
oil. Now where had I heard that before? Oh, yes, the MIT Phd'd Dead
Dynosaur Engineer I'd met in a prior technical position.

I also found out the proportion of Octane Boost to add to the current
Monkey Pee available at the unleaded pumps that the Master of Class used in
his street bike to attack the same problem I was having mit mein maschine.

Having obtained an answer to my question, &quot;Vos ist beste?&quot;, as beste I
could, I mounted das maschine und headed back towerd the nearest FLAPS for
a can of Moroso to begin the experiment and get more data on the final ride
home with great optimism for an excellent result. At the nearest brand name
pump of currently available Monkey Pee, I added the advised proportion of
octane boost and filled the tank with the highest octane unleaded kidney
juice avaliable. I checked the oil. Dang, there's that foam again. This was
the third brand change I'd made trying to cut back on the foam. I'd went
from Castrol to Pennzoil to Quaker State. I danged well knew from the
drippings of my sponge of knowledge I had obtained that day what the next
fill would be.

(to be continued)


&gt;&gt;The carbon deposit buildup that one seems are more likely gummy tars from
&gt;&gt;longer molecules created in the combustion process.  That's why stuff like
&gt;&gt;Marvel Mystery oil is popular...it's a solvent that removes that crap (or at
&gt;&gt;least claims to).
