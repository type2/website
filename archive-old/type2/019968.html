White smoke is usually steam from condesation formed in the exhaust system as
it cools.  Blue smoke is usually oil, and black smoke is gas (running rich.)

Pop, pop at idle? Through the carb or out the tail pipe?  Valve or vacuum
leak is my guess.

&gt; Now and then, after a mile or 2, it will produce a copious

&gt; (smoking). It doesnt normally smoke (burn oil) and seems to
&gt; be running OK except for this little pop pop thing that
&gt; happens at idle now an then.
