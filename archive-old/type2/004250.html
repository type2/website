It can be done, but it's not easy or fast.  (I speak from experience here.)
Back, up and twisting is the best way to describe it.  Even more fun is
replacement of  the alternator cooling boot we've been discussing here
lately.  ;^)

IMHO, If it's marginal you may want to do it in your driveway. Before.

&gt;    Hi All.
&gt;   In preparation of the summer trip my family and I are taking this
&gt; summer.(Ontario to the east coast of Canada), a few circumstances have
&gt; popped into my head regarding breakdowns. What to do if this
happens.......?
&gt;    One question I have is, Do you have to remove the fan shroud to replace
&gt; the alternator in a Type 4 powered bus? I've removed it while rebuilding
an
&gt; engine but have never had to replace it insitu. Is it just a matter of
&gt; pulling the rear tin and alt. tin
&gt; and pulling the alt. back and up? Only other way out is down but the
muffler
&gt; and r/h heat exchanger would have to be pulled first:(  That's a job I
don't
&gt; care to do on the side of the road.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
