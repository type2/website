Phil,

You can use is on the following areas:
-case halves
-push rod tube seals on both case and head sides
-oil pump to case on both sides of the gasket(very thin)
-cylinders to case(both sides of the shims if used)

remember never us a sealant where the cylinders mate to the heads.  Also I 
never use a sealant on my valve covers, I always look for the underlying 
problem(original german bails and covers, etc.) and fix that instead of 
cleaning goop off with every valve adjustment.

When you use Yamabond you can either use your finger to apply to a clean 
smooth surface or a small disposable brush like one used for soldering flux 
that doesn't leave the bristles behind.  This stuff is truly fantastic... If 
only I could use it on my teanagers to make them stop being the occasional 
leaks.
