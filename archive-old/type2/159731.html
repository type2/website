&gt; I did my first 100 mile break-in tune up on my '70's new, but bone-stock,

How did you break your engine in?  I know this is a highly debatable 
subject, but when I break my engines in I drive them HARD so the rings 
seat.  If you don't, the cylinders glaze over.

Here are a couple articles:

good luck!
