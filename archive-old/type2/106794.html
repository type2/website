Subject: RE: no brake lights

As I said before my bus seems to be a mix of the 68-69 and 69-70 diagram. I 
have the ten fuse fuse box but the 4 pin e flasher. The wires on the small 
harness for the master cylinder are not even matching any wire colors from the 
diagrams until 72. Looks like someone replaced it with a later harness. 
Question, think I should find one of the twelve fuse fuse boxes and rewire the 
front end according to the diagram? Think this will take care of the wire 
gremlins? All other wiring to the rear of the dash as far as I can tell is 
wired correctly and with the correct color code.
