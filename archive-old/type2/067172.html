Yes, Joel, but it would have had to travel about eight feet 
backwards, towards the rear of the bus, crawled up on top of the 
heater air hose, undone a factory heater hose tie-down, slipped 
its key ring through the tie-down, tightened it up again, and 
waited there 17 years for me to find it.  (:-O)  Claro?

I'm gonna call this VW mechanic who worked at the VW Agency here 
for years, before they started selling Cadillacs instead of VWs, 
and ask him whether or not they used to hide keys like that.

And yes, there were and still are, idiot dealer salesmen here, 
just like everywhere else.
