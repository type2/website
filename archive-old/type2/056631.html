Well ......... A great time was had by all.

Got there Friday PM to about 25 busses. All parked on the edge of a valley in
the mountains, very nice site for the event. Socialized too late but enjoyed
the company of old and new bus friends.

Took three kids and the '69 quickly became the &quot;hanging&quot; area for the preteen
group. I'm getting old. :-((

Saturday was a do nothing day with lots of busses to see and talk about. Saw
two red '71 westies like my &quot;work in progress&quot; URGE. People headed out to
fish, swim, shop, etc. Very laid back and relaxing. If I did not meet you, I
was the dad always asking where his kids were. :-)

Saturday PM, listee Steve Lashley won the longest traveled prize. The Big
Bonfire was cancelled due to a ban on large fires in the dry weather. No one
seemed to care, and made multiple little ones. I think the total was 57 busses
at the festival. Oldest was a beautiful 57 westie. Newest was a Eurovan
camper.

Saw listees Mike Myers (the host of the event), Dave Rastric, David Martin,
Chris Cybulsky, Marv Krupps, Kelly Brown, Steve Lashley, ..... seems like I am
forgetting someone? Kelly, aka Met Wiz, was showing off pics of his current
job (my bus), and I must say, she it looking much better.

I crashed about 12:00 but the party was on till after 4 AM. I don't know how
they could last that long. I'm getting old. 

Sunday AM was a carabus on the Blueridge Parkway. 30 busses went on a
beautiful ride to Price Park. Very nice. That is where we said our goodbyes
until next year. Rastric left his bus running as had no starter. I knew he was
on his way to meet some beauty at the beach, so he came home with me to get a
new starter. One thing about the beach = no hills to roll start from. :-(
Dave is a great guy, reminds me TOO much of me at that age (before I cut my
hair and had 4 kids).

On a VERY sad note: Danny Morganelli's beautiful '62 suffered a fire on the
way to the event. I saw part of the video, and it looks like a complete loss.
He took it much better than I would have. A lesson: He had insurance. Get it
when you spend years working on a restoration you can lose in 10 minutes.

There was much talk about Hanging Dog in Murphy, North Carolina, and
Oktoberbus in Union Grove, NC. Looks like both will be well attended.

Hats off the Mike &quot;Buddah&quot; Myers for a wonderful festival!

Peace,
Ric
