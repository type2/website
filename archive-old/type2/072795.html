List-
When I turn the ignition key to start the engine on my 72 Bus, the cylinder
around the key recesses in and should pop back out when the engine is
turned off and the key removed. It doesn't always do this. The key comes
out but the cylinder stays in. At that point the key won't go back in  and
I can't start the engine again until I get the cylinder back out. This is
not covered in either Bentley or Haynes. Does anyone know how to fix this?
I've tried oil and graphite but the problem persists. Any ideas? If this
really gets stuck I'll really be stuck wherever I am.
Thanks
