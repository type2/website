Subject: Re: Synchronizing carbs

Maybe later...if I don't end up pitching this one in a fit of pique. My
birthday's coming up....

In the meantime, it's &quot;My First Carb Synchronizer&quot; by Fisher-Price.

&gt; I have to agree. My husband has the 19.95 model and he wishes he had the

&gt; &gt; BTW guys, the $19.95 Unisyns are worth around $19.95. The $50 models are
&gt; &gt; worth $200  (if you have ever used one).
