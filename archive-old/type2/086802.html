&gt;     The first problem I am going to tackle is the exhaust.  It is very loud, 
&gt; It is the stock system.  The whole system seems to be fused together in some 

&gt; individual parts as needed.  Anyway, I am not even going to mess with it, I 
&gt; am going for the whole new system.  I was wondering what the drawbacks were 

the aftermarket ones are very flimsy and others here will give you the
horror stories, also you will lose what little heat you have with an
entire new system.

I have a 78 and converted to the older 74-75 exhaust system which is
avaliable in Stainless Steel, good and solid and should last a long time.
