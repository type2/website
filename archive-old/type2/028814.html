&gt; First vendor complaint:  I ordered a 'complete exhaust system including
&gt; crossover pipe' from our friends (and I do like them) www.busdepot_dot_com and
&gt; they call me and say they don't have any crossover pipes.  I guess I could
&gt; have canceled the order then, but I didn't.  I don't think I
&gt; would have been
&gt; as willing to put together a stock exhaust system if I'd known
&gt; this earlier,
&gt; I'd already received the catalytic converter for the system from them a
&gt; month prior to this call.  And I've been waiting over a month now
&gt; for my new
&gt; steering rack, which he told me when they just called, that they're still
&gt; trying to get a hold of their vendor..   Hope it gets all gets here before
&gt; my honeymoon road trip!


Unfortunately, you've hit two tough items. The first (the crossover pipe) is
normally not a tough item at all.  In fact it is something we normally stock
in fairly large quantity, but the manufacturer is backordered for two more
weeks. Unfortunately there is only one supplier for this part in the world
(literally), so I can do nothing but wait. I even offered to double my order
quantity or pay extra if they could build more sooner, but they said there
was nothing they could do.

The steering rack was a closeout from the distributor, at about 70% off the
original price. We sold out and contacted him to reorder. He is usually very
responsive but this time has not returned my calls.  I am not sure why,
unless he does not have any more. If he continues to be unresponsive I am
not sure if I will be able to find another source at this price, although I
will search all ends of the earth before giving up.  I should have an answer
about this by Monday one way or the other.  If it is positive, you'll have
the part next week.
