&gt;Definitely try the NAPA store in your area.  Many have a paint matching
&gt;service.  They can look up the formula for L90D and reproduce it on the 
&gt;spot.  Put
&gt;it in spray cans too!  AND it's cheaper than the online guys.

I called - one of the NAPAs here in Dallas used to do it, but no more.

&gt;Regarding Wolfsburg West............it has been my experience with WW that
&gt;they have miscellaneous parts and products in their warehouse down in Corona
&gt;that simply are not in their catalog.  Paint seems to be one of those 
&gt;items.  I
&gt;could never find Gray-Black in their catalog but people kept on telling me 
&gt;they
&gt;had it in spray cans.  So, I gave 'em a call.  Sure enough, it was there.
&gt;You might try the same with Pastel White.

Called 'em, they don't have any.  :-(
I also tried the VW dealers, they had touchup paint, but none in spraycans.

Any other ideas?
I really want some L90D in spraycans, but I can't deal with $30+ per can.
Are there any readily available alternatives that are decent quality and a 
close match?

Thanks,
         -David
