&gt; Is the big fat rear wheel nut on my 1969 bus a 45mm?
&gt; Muir said it would be 36mm, and I happened to have one.
&gt; But, it's a lot bigger than that.  I measured it with the 
&gt; ruler on my leatherman super tool (the best tool I have ever
&gt; had).  So, it's 45mm?

I think it's 46mm. You're much more likely to find 1 13/16, which fits 
fine. But I'd be sort of surprised if they have it at Sears.

(Don't even *try* doing this with a 1/2&quot; drive).
