&gt; the trouble of fixing it after reading about the need for the flaps to

&gt; It's been a daily driver as well as used for trips.  Go figure.   I
&gt; question whether the flaps allow more &quot;uniform expansion&quot;; they allow it
&gt; to get to endstage faster, yes, but blocking air to the heads/cylinders
&gt; should't change the relative rate difference of expansion?

the real usfullness of the flaps is to help the anemic heating system in
cold weather, without the flaps there would never be any heat, such that
it is.   Which BTW is a major reason for em in water cooled cars, also
they help with the exhaust emissions.

as for water cooled, my Mercedes thermostat failed on the road once years
ago and I yanked it out on the side of an interstate and never got around
to putting it back, 100K+ later when I sold it with 584K on the odometer
it was still going strong.
