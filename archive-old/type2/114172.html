&gt;True that the 911 does not have flappers

The design of that engine is totally different. I'm not surprised that bolting pieces of it onto other engines has undesired effects. The more you look into the design of it the more subtle details appear even though it's air-cooled like a VW. For example, there appear to be push-rod tubes underneath that engine but there are no push rods inside.

There are many models and Porsche changed the cooling system over the years many times to deal with high engine temperatures so I imagine getting up to termperature wasn't a problem. They use multiple oil thermostats and the may of the oil coolers had no fan blowing over them. I'm really not an expert on that engine but I can image how it warms up quickly in the driveway.
