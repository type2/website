Subject: Re: [T2] SingleCab bumper = Any other splitty bumper?

&gt; This is a question better posted to the vintage list.  But the simple
answer
&gt; is yes - the rear bumpers for the trucks differ from the bumpers for the
&gt; buses in that the corners are much squarer.

Haha, I totally spaced that one. I signed up for this list when I had my
'78. Whoops! Thanks for reminding me!

&gt; What I don't know, however, is if you can adapt a bus bumper to fit a
truck.
&gt; Maybe some cutting or re-shaping of the bumper?  Maybe a slightly longer
&gt; mounting bracket?  Ask on the vintage list and you'll probably find the
&gt; answers.

Will do Mike, thanks a ton!
