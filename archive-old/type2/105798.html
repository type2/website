Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Leak

&lt;&lt;  My question: Once I clean the engine with degreaser, will I really be
able to tell where the leak is from. I am thinking its the oil cooler
because the oil is on the left side of the motor.
    2nd question: Is there anyone in the Hampstead, Jacksonville or
Wilmington area that might be able to help me with this. It's always easier
with a 2nd person.
Later,

You might have to call around to the FLAPS but one of them should stock
phlorescent dye. Add some (follow directions on package) and get a black
light (Wow, man). Then, at night (unless you've got access to a dark ga-
rage), let the engine idle until you start to see the glow. Some oil leaks
are tough to pinpoint on VW engines because the fan keeps a constant
flow of air blowing the oil around...
