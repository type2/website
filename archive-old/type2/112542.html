Subject: Back up switch/engine stall

I recently installed a new back up light switch in my 69 bus (same part# that 
came off), hooked it up, put it in reverse and the engine stalls. Take it 
immediately out of reverse and the engine kicks back on. Thought maybe this 
could be that I had the wires on backwards because they are both black, so I 
switched them and no change. Unhook the switch all together and there is no 
problem. Weird huh! The only thing I have recently done to the bus is put a new 
starter,CV's, cleaned the ground strap for the tranny, and the B/U switch. I've 
looked at the wiring and it looks clean and hooked up correctly. Any ideas on 
where to start?
