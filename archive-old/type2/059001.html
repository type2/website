Subject: Re: Coil &amp; Points Whoops

Volks,

Scott Fraser wrote me on my response to the burnt points thread, and I
felt some of his points should be forwarded to this list.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. 
But, in practice, there is.

&gt; &gt; Well, I don't know about the points, tho I believe it might.  The
&gt; &gt; thing I *am* sure it will damage is your coil!  When the points are
&gt; &gt; open the battery is feeding 12V to the coil. Normally, this lasts a
&gt; &gt; fraction of a second and the coil builds up a tremendous charge which
&gt; &gt; is fed to the plug to cause the spark.  If the engine is not turning
&gt; &gt; and the points are in the wrong position, the energy feeds in, but is
&gt; &gt; never discharged to the plug.  Instead it builds up as heat, which
&gt; &gt; will cook the coil! 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; The woops here is that when the points are OPEN there is NO current flow
&gt; and no problem.  If the points are CLOSED (completing the path from 12V
&gt; through the coil and then to ground), the coil will then be continuously
&gt; conducting current and start cooking away.  Everything else you stated
&gt; after the points being open part is completly correct.  I elaborate and
&gt; run-on below.

Scott is absolutely right, my dyslexia stikes again! :-)

&gt; A simple test of this would be to leave the 12V ON and disconnect the
&gt; wire from the coil to the dizzy.
&gt; 
&gt; We have this problem with the engine stand and the coils direct
&gt; connection to the battery (no switch installed on the stand yet).  If we
&gt; get to tinkering with the engine and the coil is plugged in, it doesn't
&gt; take long for the coil to get HOT HOT HOT!
&gt; 
&gt; Also from a probabality standpoint, there is more chance of the points
&gt; being closed (and causing problems) than open.  Is typical dwell angle
&gt; 30?  If thats the case we have a ((360 - 30*4)/3.6)% chance of the
&gt; points being closed.

The answer is yes and no, of course (bureaucrat that I am)....

First, the dwell angle, if absolutely correct is 50 degrees, which means,
in theory, that the odds are ((360 - 50*4)/3.6)% or 44.44%, but...

Second, I think the odds of the points landing closed are near 100%.  The
reason is that the top of the lobe on the distributor cam is also the top
of the compression stroke for one of the cylinders.  Since that is an
uncomfortable place for the engine to stop, I believe it is much more
likely to either slide forward or back from there, leaving the points in
the closed, overheat-the-coil, burn-the-points position.  In other words,
*don't* leave the ignition on with the engine not running!  or at least,
unplug the coil if you do!
