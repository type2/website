Subject: New Arizona law (was Some people...)

As of 1/1/97 any motor vehicle mfg date of 1967 and newer must pass
emissions testing in the first or second test attempts or it will not be
licensed. Period. No waivers as was possible prior to that (1/1/97) date.
Granted, I do not know all of the specifics but the point is that they are
clamping down more and more. I personally am interested in grabbing all of
the stock air cleaner and carb/intake items required for the Resto '67 type
II for the time when they come around (similar to California) and force
retro fitting and ticket for not having the same engine as when it was
emissioned. (eg a reserve &quot;emission test engine&quot;)

Currently, vehicles 1967 and newer (which reside within the counties
surrounding the Tucson and Phoenix metro areas~ Pima and Maricopa counties)
are required to go through the test. If you fail then you need to get the
vehicle adjusted and then retested. If failed the second time then it is
possible to get a waiver and still get the tag for the car. It seems a
little bogus to me actually...

I beleive that newer vehicles are tested every year and older (starting with
'67) get tested every other year. It could be just the opposite. I am about
to find out real soon via the 1776 with the dual dels and the engle 110.
Oooh! I can hardly wait. 8P &quot;Uh, like sure it's stock don't cha know!&quot;

I will report with the real facts when I find out. Any Arizona lurkers know
the real 411 / shiznit?
