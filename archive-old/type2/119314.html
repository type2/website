Subject: re: [T2] Sliding Door Track Gone...Ideas?

Hi Duane,

I was surfing Richard Atwell's site last week and discovered this link, 
it has a very detailed explanation of what's involved and the pics are 
very good:

Depending on the degree of damage on your bus, you may be able to get 
away with doing less... In my old 73 westfalia I replaced the &quot;floor&quot; 
of the slider track due to a couple of sizable holes, and the repair 
lasted for a couple of years. Right now my family is working on a 75 
westy that needs inner and outer rockers on both sides completely 
replaced, and we're going to do it the right way this time around. The 
website above does a great job of explaining how the parts go together, 
which is not at all obvious when you a re looking at it fully 
assembled.

Happy trails,

&gt; The slider door bottom track on my '73 VW Standard Bus  is rusted out 
&gt; at the
&gt; front.
&gt; This is letting the door come off when brought to the near-closed 
&gt; position
&gt; if it is not lifted UP into the top track.
&gt; Has anyone changed this track before?
&gt; What is involved?
&gt; Are the parts limited to the inner and outer rockers and the track 
&gt; piece?
&gt; Thanks for any help!
