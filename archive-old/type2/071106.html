Subject: Headaches and Heaterboxes
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

A few weeks ago i put some heater boxes on. They were not brand new but they 
were from out west and a little cruddy. I cleaned the outside so they 
wouldn't have to burn off the crud. I used new gaskets on my heads and 
everything seemed tight so there should not have been any way for the exaust 
to leek into the channel. Despite my efforts I still arrive at work slightly 
weary with a dull headache. I've also tried a CO detector and didn't get any 
alarm. Just wondering if anybody else out there getting headaches from what 
seems to be dusty heaterboxes.
