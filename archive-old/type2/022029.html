Subject: Bus won't run i need help
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

OK just put a new motor it went in while. Everything hooked back up. It 
cranks over and everything but it will not start. I have no spark. Before i 
get tons people asking me if i have a good coil, points, condensor and wires. 
I have checked all of them. If i am doing something wrong let me know. I need 
my bus back running by monday since this is my first day of college and i 
need transporation. If anyone wants to give me a hand this weekend and they 
are in the Northern, IL area that would be great. Thanks alot
