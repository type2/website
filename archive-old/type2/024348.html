The info about engine type was lost in my previous message:
Type 4 1700cc   -73 

&gt; &gt;Question: is it by any means possible to replace this spring without 
&gt; &gt;pulling the engine ?? 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but it requires iron patience and nerves of steel.

Do you have any sugested procedure. As I can see now:
problem 1, removing the upper tin. Possible ?
problem 2, pulling the head. Is there room enough with the engine in place ?

And my e-addres is
