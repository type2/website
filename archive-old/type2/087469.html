Subject: POR-15 questions

Hi all - I've been hearing and reading a lot about this stuff called POR-15, 
and would like to get the list members' opinions on it.  Any good or bad 
comments would be welcome, I just want honest ones.  A concern for me is the 
cost.  According to the POR-15 website, you should use four steps to prepare 
and finish the surface:  (1) Marine Clean, (2) Metal Ready, (3) POR-15, and 
(4) Chassiscoat Black.  The website lists prices for a gallon of each as:  
$28.75, $28.75, $95.00, and $140.00.  Is it worth the expense?  Do you HAVE 
to use all four chemicals?  How much coverage will you get with a 
pint/quart/gallon?  Reviews of POR-15 I've seen are positive, but that's a 
lot of money for me on top of the other parts and repairs I'm getting.  
Thanks for your advice!

Larry
