Subject: (long)Tampa NEATO  &amp; Land-O-Lakes events

     Dave Easterwood picked me up at my office Friday noonish and the boss 
     gave me the rest of the day off (probably so we wouldn't be getting 
     into trouble at work ;^) .  So I took Dave to Kevin Murray's Busbones 
     and we got into trouble there instead.  The weather turned bad so we 
     stayed at my place Friday night.  Caravan'ed to Tampa Saturday 
     morning, my '66 standard/camper, Lea's '63 single cab, and Dave's 
     '59(?)single cab.  No problems to Reeves VW, the site of the NEATO 
     meet in Tampa.  Much bigger than last year.  Seems there were about 50 
     (?) split busses in attendance.  Found some goodies.  Overheard two 
     salesmen at Reeves talking about how much they hated having all the 
     old busses in their lot; bad for business.  Interesting attitude.  It 
     was a very nice day.  Everyone was friendly and it seemed we were all 
     there for the same reason; love of the car and the kind of adventures 
     and people it attracts.  
     
     Saturday night camping at Quail Run with many, many other VW folks.  
     Camaraderie was the order of the day.
     
     Sunday we arrived several hours early at the site of the Bugjam in 
     Land-O-Lakes.  There was one man at the entrance area for 
     participants.  He directed all the traffic from the highway into the 
     lot in front of the entrance gate, as he well should.  But there was 
     no one in that lot to keep the traffic orderly and it turned into five 
     or six half-assed lanes of traffic bottlenecking into one car at a 
     time to enter the gate.  Freaking ridiculous.  One solid hour later we 
     were able to get into the show area and there was a long line behind 
     us of potentially overheating aircooled motors.  No one was happy.
     
     After that fiasco was over we set up Lea's vehicle and began our 
     daylong walk around.  Man, there was a lot to see.  Some beautiful 
     vehicles, some ridiculous vehicles, but A LOT of vehicles.  Whatever 
     you were interested in, it was there. The crowd wasn't nearly as 
     approachable for conversation, except in the swap area.  I always love 
     to see and deal with people bringing their stuff in their personal 
     busses, laid out on blankets or an old card table.  Much better than 
     dealing with plastic wrapped parts from vendors who have the prices 
     marked on everything and hire people to work the booth who barely know 
     what those parts are and have to go find someone to answer any 
     questions.  Somebody stop me!  
     
     The day was worth it, indeed.  I found a nice, hefty trailer hitch for 
     the '66 for cheap and a few little things for xmas presents.  We did 
     enjoy our day but probably won't do it again.  They announced that the 
     site would be changed next year so stay tuned to the magazines when 
     the time rolls around to find out where it will be.
     
     Sunday night five of us caravaned back to my place in Gainesville for 
     whiskey, conversation, a wood fire, and a floor to sleep on.  I got us 
     lost twice and earned the Magoo award for the rally.  Thanks guys!
     
     We'll definately do the Tampa NEATO show again.  So far, that and the 
     Blue Ridge rally have been our favorites.  It was great to hang with 
     Dave Easterwood and Alan Becker, two friendly, helpful, sincere, and 
     knowledgable people.  Oh yeah, dozens of people at the Bug Jam asked 
     me where I got my &quot;Search &amp; Rescue&quot; t-shirts.  They were a HIT!  
     Thanks Richard.
