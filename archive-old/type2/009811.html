&gt; I agree to keeping money out of it. But maybe there should be a
stockpile of
&gt; parts donated by listes to help each other. Only problem is who's
girage are
&gt; we going to sacrifice for that one?

Do we really need to centralize the parts?  In most cases, the
breakdown parts one needs are available new from various sources.  The
big problem is getting to these parts if your bus is already inoperable.

Another thought is to set up a phone or email &quot;hot line&quot; to the parts
vendors that are active on the list, where you could get a needed part
Fed-ex'd to East Armpit, ND immediately, rather than waiting for the
normal order/shipping process to take place.  Some thought is needed
to keep this avenue from being abused in non-emergencies.  Any vendors
have thoughts?
