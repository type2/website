&gt;Hello All:
&gt;
&gt;I'm going through my first VW engine build, and I've reached a point where 
&gt;I need some help.  The Muir book refers to a spring that goes into the 
&gt;distributor opening in the engine case, but they don't show a picture of 
&gt;it.  I went to a local VW junk yard to find one of these springs, and the 
&gt;proprietor gave me a small spring that looks like the spring out of a 
&gt;ball-point pen, except a little thicker.  I was skeptical, but he insisted 
&gt;it was the correct spring.  Last night, I tried fitting the distributor 
&gt;drive shaft in to the engine case, and there's no way that this can be the 
&gt;correct spring.  It won't stay in place under the distibutor shaft, 
&gt;because there's no place for it to rest.

It should rest in the top center of the distributor drive shaft - there 
should be a hole for it.  And yes, it does look a lot like the spring from 
a ballpoint pen.  Going from memory here, it should be about 3/16&quot; in 
diameter and maybe an inch long.  What are you doing with the Muir book for 
a rebuild??  Get the Wilson book!
