Subject: Front end questions 
Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2000 19:02:05 -0600

I had a front end alignment done last summer and found out at the time that
I needed a number of things replaced. I didn't have the cash to do all at
once so I had the ball joints replaced, and the right tie rod end. From
there, they aligned the van as best they could. This was done at a VW
specialist
Since then I have replaced the steering dampner and completed the center pin
procedure. I still need to replace my steering box as it knocks when the
steering wheel is turned back and forth at a standstill.
Since I did the steering dampner and center pin my steering wheel is off. It
was straight before I did this. I don't know how replacing these things
changed it, but I'd like it straight again. My question is...should I wait
until I replace the steering box to straighten it? I don't know when I'll be
able to afford the steering box. And, will I need to get the van aligned
again after all of this other work. The van does wander to the right a tad
now.
