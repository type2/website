Subject: Re: [T2] In need of a distributor Vaccum can.

Yeap, that was my point Don, but i have a beter timming, varb setting 
with my old and OEM distributor, my idle is 800 stable with the Weber... 
with the 009, 1200 at a very best. But a good spare of course.

100 looks expensive to me.

i don't want to see my  girlfriend  driving the bus with her friends  
for a short trip with a tired vaccum can, we all know what could happen.....

I those could be rebuilt!!!

&gt;Yeah, that's what I said too. I'd keep a 009 around as a backup unless
&gt;you canl find a dizzy with a good vacuum can.
