Subject: 79 seats into 76 Westy

I saw many posts in the archive about this but could find no resolution.  I
have a 76 Westy.  The seats were screwed.  Broken frame, bad pads the works.
I got a great set out of a 78 or 79.  The problem is the method to lock the
seat in place is different.  The 79 seat will fit but has no way to lock it
down.  Any ideas short of welding?  Thanks.
