Subject: Re: [T2]Blowby out dipstick update update

thanks barry and although great ideas ....? i just want this fixed.. i really dont want to have to take my peanut butter tube off the dipstick each time i want to check the oil level.. arg'..?&gt;/. for some rreason there is oil shooting out of the dipstick tube and shouldnt be wasnt in Vw's design......
trying to stay away from that if i can if it is a test to check something i am A ok with it but as far as a permanent soultion there is a reason for this happening...
maybe the P/L are bad on this one as well? i dont know they shouldnt be though looked really good and measured right before being installed..
i still think its awful coincidental that with two diffrent long blocks getting the very same reactions? only minor things being the same on both engines...plug wires,carb,oil breather(til today),dizzy,all tin,.. the new long block was nothing but a long block with a brand new oil presure switch in it./..ready to have all above and etc swapped over and installed and crunk up////
but what really throws me now is that there is a diffrent breather&gt;?
can the carb cause such a blow by problem.. i am reaching here cause i really dont think carb could cause blow by but asked anyways...might can??????
 
thanks for any help or ideas anyone has i am considering possibilites to get to the bottom of this.. somehow..&gt;?
i think its something simple for some reason&gt;? cant say what though wished i could~!~
peace and love
Chris
i dont ever go over 55 mph ok maybe 60 downhill if i aint paying attention...
this engine here being new though i havent been over 50 mph yet and still varying the speed faster to slower and such til the engine gets broke in some and then change oil over at 300 miles proabldy got 100 miles on it maybe if even close to that....

Chris, here are two more Wild A$$ ideas:

(1) pull the 'L' air hose off JUST the oil breather and just loosen it at 
the 'S' tube; rotate the air hose 90 degrees clockwise, and blow into it. 
Is it blocked??

(2) take the 'peanut butter' hose OUT of the peanut butter jar and feed it 
into the oil filler tube. For now, use you material resources and 
imagination to make the connect as solid as possible (temporary, of course. 
Stuff the opening with rags...) If you can drive like that, then ask 
someone to send you one of the famous '710' caps so you can drill a hole in 
it to permanently fit the peanut butter tube through. You should then be 
recycling your oil from the oil dipstick back thru the oil filler cap

(3) what kind of vacuum readings have you been getting?? With the oil 
breather ON, and with the oil breather OFF. Is the vacuum needle SOLID, or 
does it jump around.

When you keep your speed below 60 mph, do you still have oil blowby??

Readers Digest. Illiterates die of intestinal blockage.



Peace and Love
