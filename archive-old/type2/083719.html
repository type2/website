Subject: It's Friday &amp; I am taking my first roadtrip

List,
The day has finally arrived for my first extended trip
in my recently repaired '72 Westy.  As soon as I get
out of this office, we are loading up and making our
way west from Missoula, MT with a final destination of
the Gorge in George, Washington on Saturday.  If
anyone out there will be at the String Cheese Incident
show, look me up.  We will be in a blue Westy with MT
plates.  BTW, if you are on the AIRS list between
Missoula and George...I have your number.
Later,
Billy Ray
Misoula, MT
