Subject: Ring job or valves?

 There was a post up here recently on replacing the rings and we all
gave him advice.

 He had good readings on 2 cylinders and zip on the others.

 I dumped all my trash which is where the original question was,
(sorry) so I don't know who it was.

 My question to you and I think it was a type 4 engine is why do you suspect
rings and not just the valves?

 Why would 2 sets of rings be alright and the others worn beyond 
redemption?

 Sounds to me like your problem is not as bad as you thought.
