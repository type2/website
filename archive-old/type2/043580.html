&gt;hey list,
&gt;
&gt;you might remember me as the guy who's fan fell off of his new rebuilt AVP
&gt;longblock and now has to replace his crankshaft. anyways, the question is,
&gt;what is the torque spec for the bolt that holds the fan hub onto the
&gt;crankshaft. it's a 13mm, i think. muir has a spec for a 30mm bolt of similar
&gt;description, but it's a 13mm. couldn't find it in bentley, although i don't
&gt;really know my way around that book yet.
&gt;
&gt;i'm putting my old block back in the bus while i rebuild my rebuilt engine.
&gt;BTW, my mishap was not covered by AVP's warranty because my old-ass bolt
&gt;broke. they said if it breaks, it was overtorqued, and if it just falls out,
&gt;it was undertorqued.
&gt;
&gt;TIA,
&gt;

&gt;  Marko,
My Wilson book says the Type 4 fan hub bolt has 23 lbs. of torque.  
Should be a large washer with it also..  The three fan bolts are listed
at 14 lbs.  Hope this helps.
