Need a bit of help determining the fix for my signals. I have a 76 Westy
and the signals worked great. The next time I got in the signals didn't
work at all. The signal light comes on in the dash but does not blink
and none of the exterior signals light at all.
The fuses are fine and I've looked in the archives but found no specific
answers.

Sounds like it could be a flasher relay but wouldn't that still allow
the exterior light to come on - just not blink?

Thanks for any help you can offer
