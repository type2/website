Subject: My '77 Westfalia is becoming an Oiler

It has been 110,000 miles since a rebuild.  Oil consumption is now about a
quart every 150 miles.   But, I just went on a 500 mile trip with full power
on the interstate, travelling about 65-70 mph.  Sometimes a bit of blue
smoke from the tailpipe.  I also got about 22-23 mpg, about like this van
has always been.

Other things to consider besides rings that might be causing this much
consumption?  I do have leaks at all the lifters...and leave a big spot
whenever she sits parked.  Seems I would not be getting good performance
with this much oil consumption.

Dan
