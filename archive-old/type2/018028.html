Jonn, thanks for the parts I ordered.  The items you said that would be
shipped from RMMW arrived today.  Fast service, thanks.  Only one
problem, and I now you had nothing to do with it.  Apparently they
(RMMW) sent two different key blanks.  Didn't notice until the second
one was halfway cut, it is the wrong one anyway.  What should I do? 
Should I contact RMMW, or let you take care of it.  I hope you don't
mind me posting this on the type2 and vintagebus lists.  But I think you
r Service is excellent.  You even offered to ship separately the parts,
because you didn't have everything in stock.  I will be doing  future
business with you.
