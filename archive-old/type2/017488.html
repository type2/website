...sort of.  I still have a carb problem to remedy, but it did kick over
enough to warm up the exhaust header pipes.  AMAZING!

Many thanks to those who responded with test-running and break-in
advice.  After realizing that I'd hooked up the fuel  lines backward at
the pump, and that I had an apparent dead coil (remember, this engine
has never run while I've owned it), I finally got the engine to sputter
a bit, and the oil pressure light went out properly.  I think I'm almost
there.

The carb seems to have bad bushings on the throttle plate - gas was
dripping off either end of the throttle plate shaft.  I have a spare
carb I'll throw on and try again.

Another advice request:

This engine is a 1600SP with a 28PICT carb.  I have a spare 28PICT that
is OK, but I'll need something better when time comes to run.  Is it
worth investing in tools &amp; skills to rebush carbs (yeah, I know - it
depends - but how about for early carb owners)?  If I decide to buy a
spankin' new carb, I may not be able to get a 28.  Other recommendations
for this setup?  It's stock except the header.

Thanks!
joe
