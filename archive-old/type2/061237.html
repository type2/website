My 80 Westy idles so slow it sometimes  stalls when first started.  When hot it seems to idle a little too fast, and the idle adjustment screw is at the slowest setting.  

My guess is the too slow idle is tied in to some misadjustment in the &quot;choke&quot; part of the Bosch L-Jetronic system (I think it's interesting that L is German for air - Luftthansa Airlines - air being the most important parameter this Bosch system measures).  I also have made a guess that I'm running too rich when the weather is not really cold, because if it ever is allowed to stall during the warmup period it is very hard to restart, almost like it's flooded.

Has anyone played around with the air flow adjustments (the ones that can affect air polution)?  I was wondering how sensitive they were, and if they would solve this problem?
