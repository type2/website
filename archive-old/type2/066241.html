Steve, thanks, this was fascinating:

&gt;Methyl is cheap to generate, from wood pulp and burns well and clean.  It
&gt;is, however incredibly poisonous (even the vapors) and quite corrosive to
&gt;many materials used in current (and older {that's us}) autos.  You think
&gt;you got gas leaks now? Ha!

Is it more poisonous than gasoline? Do you know more about what it corrodes
(if it's just rubber, it doesn't seem to me to be that big a deal.
Aluminum, well, maybe more mala).

&gt;Ethyl is much more expensive to produce and competes with food production.
&gt;On a small scale, it's not bad, but if we tried to replace any measurable
&gt;percentage of the US's motor fuel consumption, we would drive the cost of
&gt;corn through the roof.

I keep thinking about that 50% of landfill space that people keep
complaining is filled with grass clippings. Not optimal for fermentation,
but adequate, and wasted now. My understanding is that you can make ethanol
from just about anything organic including animal by-products. Speaking as
a VW Bus freak, the prospect of running on grass and chicken beaks has a
certain declasse appeal to it. ;)

IAC the &quot;massive scale&quot; argument doesn't really move me, in the first place
because a partial improvement is still a net improvement (it does not
follow from the fact that everybody couldn't run on alcohol that some folks
couldn't) and in the second because it's hypothetical. We know how alcohol
is produced *now*, but we don't know how it might be if you put the
American enteprenurial mind to work with a profit potential this massive.
How about...alcohol from fermented algae which feed on a slurry made of
sewage and rancid fast-food hamburger grease?

&gt;Producing either methyl or ethyl on a large scale
&gt;is also quite polluting.  Imagine living just downwind of 100,000 gallons
&gt;of homebrew.

Is it dangerous or does it just stink?
