Subject: Free Stuff '78 - (more)

Northern Virginia.  Hey, are all you guys out there SLEEPING (or, worse
yet, WORKING!!)

No body wants this '78 rolling stock!!  Or even the '76 !!! (The '78 is
ready to go NOW; the '76 still needs the engine pulled and may need some
sweetener)

Andrew S. has volunteered his tow bar, and still no responses???

No ECU, but I may get lucky this weekend if John Anderson makes his way
East to DC.

Well, it does have a fuel pump, and a beautiful, spankingly clean
started motor!!  (How did  miss that the first time around??)

The trans looks clean, also.  It could have had some work on it.

I can't take it home, and all I want is one or two hubcaps!!  Heck, or
even just an emergency flasher switch, or a (another) shift knob...
