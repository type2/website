Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Help needed: Headlight wiring on 1975 bus

Hi Jamie,

Just after I pressed &quot;send&quot; I realized that I hadn't described the  
problem very well.

I just need to know where the white wire goes to in the fuse box. The  
wiring diagram suggests the top of fuse #6, but that doesn't seem to  
work. I suppose It's also possible that we might have multiple issues  
here....


Happy Trails,

Greg Potts

&gt;&gt; There is a thick white wire coming out of the D/S headlight  
&gt;&gt; bucket  that leads to the fuse box.  If I connect this wire to a  
&gt;&gt; power  source it lights up the D/S light only,
&gt;
&gt; to start off with,, that is correct Greg.
&gt; The white wire is for left high beam only..
&gt; The yellow wire is for right high beam only..
&gt; hot wire it.. and the p/s will light...
&gt; and there is 2 more wires.. white with a black strip and yellow  
&gt; with a black strip.. they are for the low beams
&gt; They each come from an individual fuse...
&gt; when you have the headlight switch on.. you should have power at  
&gt; the 2 fuse,, when you hit the dimmer.. it will change the power to  
&gt; the other 2 fuses..
&gt; I think they are the left most fuses... you should be able to  
&gt; clearly see the large wires at the fuse box
