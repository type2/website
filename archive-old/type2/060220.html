Subject: Noises again (engine this time!) :-(

 Hi,
	I'm looking for more help with strange noises. This one's an
engine problem of some sort.
 I've been hearing an &quot;exhausty&quot; noise recently. It sounds like an exhaust
leak at low to middle rpms but goes away at higher ones. Tends to come and go
a bit, too. Sometimes seems really bad and then other times I wonder if I'm 
imagining it. I'm hearing some popping on overrun, no big backfires, though.
 My bus has been due for a tuneup, which I did yesterday: it's now running
more smoothly and the problem seems less severe. I was expecting to find a
leaking heat exchanger as they are quite rusty (the outsides are pretty bad
and I'm not getting much heat just now) but havn't been able to pinpoint
a leak (and I'm not smelling any exhaust in the cabin, so I don't think
it's leaking inside the boxes).
 I'm now starting to worry about head gaskets, or the heads themselves-
what does a cracked head sound like?
 I ran a compression check and got good numbers: 140/135/140/140, but it
seems to me that a crack wouldn't necessarily show up at this sort of
pressure- especially if it's tight enough that it only leaks badly when 
combustion pressures are high (ie accelerating from low revs).
 Any thoughts? How can I pin this down (and fix it, for that matter!)?

Cheers,
	W.
