You said:

&gt; Didn't have time to measure the crank to see if it has been turned undersize
&gt; previously and could not tell from the bearings (only a part number not .10 under, etc.)
It would be .25,.50.75,(mm.) etc.
&gt; All is really good news. The pistons have some scoring on the
&gt; top edge but the cylinders are not scored.
&gt; 
&gt; The only bad thing I found inside was one half of the cam bearing next to the
&gt; cam gear had gouged out metal which accounts for the small amount of metal in
&gt; the oil. The only explanation for the engine being locked up when hot was the
&gt; metal being hot between the bearing and cam held it tight and when the cam and
&gt; all cooled down, the metal was picked up by the oil. The cam surfaces where
&gt; they run in the bearings are not scorred but there is a wear pattern on the
&gt; cam lobes.
&gt; 
&gt; I was so intent on getting the case split to find the cam that I knew was
&gt; broken that I overlooked the fact that when I was removing the FI stuff, one
&gt; of the injectors was out and it's locking clamp was still attached to the
&gt; head. Is it possible that the POP I heard was this injector popping out of
&gt; it's clamp?  I couldn't turn over the engine to try to restart it because it
&gt; was locked up.
Could you turn the engine over when it was cold?
&gt; I didn't see the loose injector, but it may have been resting loose in it's
&gt; hole. Does this make sense? Can the VW gods really be this kind to let an
&gt; injector pop and only one cam bearing fail forcing me to tear down the engine
&gt; saving a thrown rod or whatever a few more miles down the road?  A few of the
&gt; metal pieces would probably have gotten into the main or rod bearings and
&gt; cause major trouble.
Uh, I'm not sure how this would happen.
I'd theorize that the popped injector could have made one cylinder too
lean and siezed up the motor, although you'd probably have noticed
rather severe welding and melting on the rings/ ring groove area on one
piston.
I'm just guessing on this- probably need more data.
