Ian,

I think part of this is recognizing that the year isn't that significant
when it comes to brake fluid.  Yes, disc brakes ('71 and later) do run
hotter == but I think most will agree that DOT3 is fine as long as you keep
it fresh and have your brakes in proper working order.  But, my point is
that the fluid you use in a 73 isn't any different than the fluid you use in
a 78.

Of course, DOT4 is always better, has a higher boiling point... but more
expensive.  The archives tell all on this topic...

A search on &quot;71 and dot&quot; would be too narrow, as someone might not have
posted a message SPECIFICALLY mentioning a 1971 bus.  (And if you were
really looking for one, also remember to search &quot;1971 and dot&quot; plus another
search &quot;71 and dot&quot;.

I did several quick search and found a search that worked best for me &quot;brake
NEAR DOT&quot;.  If you click on this link below, you will see a lot of good
comments...

Hey All,

 Do you recommend Dot 3 or Dot 4 brake fluid in a '71 bus? Couldn't find
this info in the archives anywhere...
