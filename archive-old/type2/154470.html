Subject: RE: [T2] High Head Temp (Long)

I finally have had a chance to revisit this issue and have noted that the
engine is not sealed as well as I thought it was around the old A/C
compressor.

It turns out that the foam seal between the compressor and the body is not
in great shape.  It is possible that at highway speed, it might get pushed
out of the way.  This can be solved with a new foam seal.

The other issue is that there is a gap between the compressor and the engine
that I did not notice before.  I am not sure how to properly seal this gap.
Temporarily have placed (read this as &quot;jammed&quot;) some foam rubber in the
gap... I'm not sure what temp this foam will handle before it melts.  Any
thoughts or pictures how to seal this gap would be appreciated.

Regards,

Wayne
