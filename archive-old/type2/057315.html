Subject: Engine number on a 1976 Westy

Hi,
     I was just checking the engine numbers on my new (to me) 1976
Deluxe Westy.  I need some help in figuring out what they mean.  
     The vin number is : 236242619
The number on the Fan Shroud is : GD005901
There are two numbers on the engine case.  One has the VW emblem stamped
next to it, that number is GA005?34.  Above that number is another
number. It is 494400 62725.

Does anyone know what the 494 number is?  I know that the fan shroud
number and the case number can be different due to swaping out the fan
shroud in an engine rebuild, but what is the 494 number?

Thanks,
Stuart
