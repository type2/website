Subject: Brake caliper piston rotation

Heya all
I am attempting to install my new caliper but I need to rotate the
pistons a little to match with the plates. The manual says to use
brake caliper piston plyers, of which I have none. So my question
is , What other tool or technique might work for rotating these?
Thanks........
