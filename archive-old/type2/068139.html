Subject: avoid a costly mistake

Hey all:
Just thought I'd post a bit of advice that could save you some big bucks and 
a major headache, especially those of you repairing ball joints.

Once you pull the torsion arms, you look inside and see all that disgusting, 
30-year-old grease. You also notice the needle bearings about 7 mm inside 
the tubes, and maybe you think &quot;I know, I'll just pull those suckers, clean 
up the tubes real nice, regrease the whole thing and slip those bearings 
right back in.&quot;

Don't do it. LEAVE THE BEARINGS ALONE! &quot;Why?&quot; you ask. &quot;The Bentley manual 
shows the use of a slap-hammer to pull those suckers right out.&quot; I know, I 
know. But I repeat: LEAVE 'EM ALONE.

First: They don't come out easily. Likely as not, you will destroy the 
bearings getting them out. Ask me how I know. Yes, I followed the rules. No, 
I didn't use undo force. But it doesn't take a lot to crush the side of the 
bearing into the roller, then you have what's known as a seized bearing. Not 
good.

Which wouldn't really be a problem if you could find replacement bearings. 
But you can't. Not for a bus, anyway. I know, Bentley talks up a storm about 
oversize bearings and all, but it's out of date. You can't get the bearings. 
At least I couldn't, and I called almost everyone. (Finally found a USED 
bearing at Bus Boys, $25, which is better than the alternative--replacing 
the whole damn front end.) And no, you can't find those urethane bushings as 
an alternative either. They don't make them in a size to fit the bus.

I was committed to pulling at least one bearing after the first few taps 
with my slide-hammer, because the bearing was ruined almost immediately. 
Don't make the same mistake.
Bob
