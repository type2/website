The wheel is mounted to the body on my bus.  I bought the mount and
cover from Rocky Mountain Motor Works for $35.  It was easy to install. 
There have been threads on better ways to mount the tire.  It works fine
for me, but I have not had a flat yet.  I think there is an insert that can be
put in the hole so you don't tear your bus' nose off when you remove the
tire from the mount.  Think Ron Salmon said something about that?

Good Luck
