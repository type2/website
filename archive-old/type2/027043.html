Hey there people.  I am just buying my first bus and my first air cooled VW. 
  I own VW jetta currently.  This bus I am buying has no engine in it so I 
am looking for another engine to put in it.  It has the mounting brackets 
for a bug engine but I don't know what engine to get.  I don't want to get 
the stock engine power and I don't want the most powerful engine in the 
world.  Something that will get me going pretty good, doesn't hog gas, will 
do good on the interstate so I can go atleast 80-90 Mphs without pushing it, 
and something not to costly.  Does anybody know were I can get a engine that 
fits that description.  Some were online, in a magazine, or at a local 
store??  Thanx peeps.  See ya.
