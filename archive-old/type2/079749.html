Subject: Re: [T2] coil wires? revisited

It could something as simple as an ignition switch. Definately replace
any bad wires though.
Ignition switches have a little solder joint in them that acts like a
fues. I've repaired them before, just resolder the joint.

&gt; Well, we finally got to check out the coil etc.  looks like the wires 
&gt; are
&gt; fried..... there is no power getting to the back at all... but, 
&gt; there are no
&gt; fuses blown either...points are fried.... not sure about all the 
&gt; rest.....
&gt; didn't have tester handy.... will do that tomorrow.... Hopefully, it 
&gt; will
&gt; not turn out to be a full rewire job on the whole bus.... but.... it 
&gt; is
&gt; looking like it......
&gt; any ideas any one?
&gt; Thanks......
