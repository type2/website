Subject: RE: [T2] Friday Poll: Vanity plates

Here in Virginia you can select different styles of plates the one we pick
has a little red heart before the letters so we put in &quot;CAMPINN&quot; so it looks
like &quot;LOVE CAMPINN&quot; . We had to add the 2nd N as CAMPIN was taken. still
looks cool. but the best I have seen driving is right after state budget
cuts they closed down alot of DMV's around here and I think a former
empolyee got this one with some help from the inside &quot; DMV SUX&quot; I love it
and now with 4-6hour wait DMV really does Suck !!

Subject: [T2] Friday Poll: Vanity plates


Hi Volks,

Last week I polled the list about parts that didn't break. Response was 
limited, so I will try something with wider appeal this week:

Best bus vanity plate. Submissions must be something you have seen in 
person, not dreamt up off the top of your head.

Personal favorites include Jamie Rivers &quot;2SLO 2BAD&quot;  and Collie Corner 
has &quot;WEB GEEK&quot;, which is also very apt. I saw a Maryland bus at 
EveryBus 2003 with &quot;CANABUS&quot; -- I would love to put that plate on my 
camper, but it would probably make for a hassle getting across the 
border. (My bus is very Canadian, but not chemically enhanced).
