Well Richard, you could rebuild that T4 at leats 2 times for that
amount as well,  $3500 is ludicrous, not to offend the origional
poster but if he paid that amount for that engine he either got
severly taken or bought the engine from a dealer, and last I checked
even their prices weren't that outlandish.

I paid $3800 total for a near mint origional paint '77 anally maintained
88k with records from new to prove it.  I did very well but still would
not figure worth over $6000.  The mint '71 with unused tent, gas heater,
etc from HMN I raved about this spring was only $4500 or so.  As a rule
ladies and gents, if you don't do your own work, you'll never get out
of a VW what you put in, sorry that's life, and if you count your own
work at $40/hr you can never likely break even period.
