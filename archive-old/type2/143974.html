Subject: Re: [T2] burning bus on COPS

Sounds great, Timo.  Say, where in Hawaii are you?  I
spent about three months there last year.  Loved every
minute of it.  You guys don't know how lucky you are. 
I spent 10 days in Honolulu then worked on a cruise
ship around the rest of the islands.  Love the
climate.  And the people were all very friendly.  I've
been in over 35 countries but Hawaii is one of my
favorite places on Earth.  Chattanooga is also one. 
Then there's Buenos Aires, Helsinki, Crucita
(Ecuador), Acapulco, and..., and...

But the US is the best.  I like the US Virgin Islands
a lot.  Didn't think I would be thrilled by Hawaii
after that.  But Oahu doesn't have the really hot
summers of the Caribbean nor the humidity.  And since
I'm a big city kind of guy, I'd have to live in
Honolulu.  May move there sometime.

Are there many busses available in Hawaii?  What do
they go for?  How expensive is it to ship one from
stateside? (Bus content, George) How in the hell do
you afford to buy a house??  Mahalo....KR

On my very
&gt; non-stock arrangement, I connected the two tubes
&gt; from the condensers
&gt; together and ran a new vent tube down through the
&gt; drain hole in the left
&gt; &quot;battery tray&quot; area. So far, so good....no leaks, no
&gt; big BOOM! If an
&gt; attendant is filling my tank, I always tell them to
&gt; fill &quot;to the first
&gt; click, only, please&quot;.  Timo 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
