Subject: Re: [T2] Electrical rant

Ray,

I thought you already did that!...musta been someone else.&lt;rolling of 
eyes&gt;.

Brand from any flaps will be fine, just be sure and get the no lead type.

Can't help on length.  Seems like Richard did a long writeup on this, but 
I can't find it.

Cheers, dave

 After searching the archives, I cannot find a
 length for the battery cable and ground cable. 
 Anyone know the right lengths.  Any certain brand
&gt; or kinds of cables that I should get?

&gt; Happy bussin'
