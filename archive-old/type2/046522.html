Subject: Re: [T2] Awning Suggestions

Some of the members of WetWesties have had less than satisfactory results
with gutter mounted roll-up awnings.  One has had to rig a tarp over the
awning and housing to prevent rainwater from entering the bus through an
open sliding door, thus rendering the expensive awning superfluous.

Most of us just rig a tarp to the rain gutter, supported at the outboard
corners by custom made [ at home :) ] poles and guyed with light line and
tent stakes/pegs.  Works very well, is inexpensive [spelled C-H-E-A-P], and
stows away compactly.

FWIW.....
