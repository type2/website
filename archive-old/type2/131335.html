Subject: Re: [T2] Dwell adjustment using dwell meter

Great idea!!

Can I take this to the next level?!?!?!

[1] connect a FLAPS HELP item HORN BUTTON with a three wires.  One wire goes 
from one of the connection points on the horn button to the battery's 
positive terminal.  From the other connection point of the horn button, two 
wires come out; one to the starter solenoid and one to the coil terminal.

[2] connect all wires  [length of wires to be determined by 'salt to taste' 
method.]

[3] put HORN BUTTON on ground, just under the rear of the VW where you can 
kneel on it while bent over to adjust the points per previous method.

[4] extrapolate and experiment and have fun.  I have a wire running from the 
starter solenoid terminal to the inside of the engine compartment, which I 
use to tap the battery positive terminal to get some rotation.  However, I 
still had to go back and forth to turn the key on.  I was just not 
imaginative enough, I guess.

[5]  for those of you who want to use the existing horn button on the 
steering column, just so you can ask your buddy to 'please blow the horn so 
I can set my dwell' are just plain weird!!

[6] Yes or No: you can make this a permanent installation, and this can be 
used with the hot start problems.

[7] Yes or No: remember to follow all other recommendations: not in gear; 
coil wire removed from distributor top AND GROUNDED; touch the wrong part of 
the points and sparky will get you; beer and gas and lose electric 
connections do not mix, but Tequila is another story...
