&lt;&lt; You know that rubberized plastic edging - &quot;T&quot; shaped that runs around all
the edges of the camper wooden interior.  the part of the &quot;T&quot; inserts into
the slotted wood to hold it in.   Mine has hardened and shrank over the
years.  Looks funky, is wavy &amp; the closet is hard to close.  Anybody know
where to find replacement edge covers?

I thank you &amp; Maynard thanks you.
