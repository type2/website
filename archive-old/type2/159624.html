&gt; It has some major cancer in the back battery panels up to the side

By &quot;major cancer&quot; I take it to mean there are large holes, or perhaps 
nothing below the side lights.  I would not put much work into such a 
bus - there are plenty of rust-free busses available as donors if you 
are patient.  The best place to find these busses is... CRAIGSLIST. 
Look at Austin, San Antonio, D/FW and Houston.  Thesamba is also good. 
A quick search came up with these that are close to what you want:

http://austin.craigslist_dot_org/car/237331137.html
http://austin.craigslist_dot_org/car/229854865.html
http://austin.craigslist_dot_org/car/246774915.html

If you expanded your search to a 500 mile radius, I bet you would find a 
few more.

&gt; The engine *looks* to have been rebuilt recently as it's still very 
&gt; pretty and has a new distributer, coil, points, etc.  The interior is in 
&gt; pretty good shape.  All equipment there and clean, even the original 
&gt; curtains.  Tires are shot.

Sounds like a great donor bus.

&gt; Whatever I end up doing, I only have 2000 to spend right now.  Am I 
&gt; dreaming?

If you are serious and willing to put in a significant amount of time 
and effort, you should be able to come out of it with a clean running 
bus, a boatload of spare parts and $1,000.
