Subject: air filters

oddly enough, this morning before all the hoopla about air filters came up, I
went out to do some things to the bus which included changing to an oil bath air
cleaner I had laying around.

I was running a paper one... and my motor ran like crap when I actually got out
on the roads.  too damn cold.  anyways...my thinking was that it would be better
for the motor to use the preheated air from underneath the bus.  and as cold as
it is I was thinking about jamming a long tube up under the cooling tin under
the heads to get that REALLY hot air ;)

warm air makes my bus run better...dunno about yours.

how much oil should be put in the oil bath air cleaner? up to that little orange
ring??

I'm trying to suck as much life as possible out of this old motor until summer
when I can build a nice one up.
