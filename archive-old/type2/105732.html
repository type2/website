Subject: VWOA Branding

About 2 weeks ago, re-installing the powerplant in HapyBus and adjusting the
timing and such, I leaned against the manifold or something very warm and
burned myself.
My wife noticed it , and yeah honey, I burned myself.
Fast forward to this evening at dinner, she looks at my arm, puzzled and
asks me, &quot;do you have some branding on your arm??&quot;
I am here to tell you folks, I have the clearest little VWOA emblem burned
into my skin.
I imagine I am looney for even taking up the bandwidth, but I ran down to
the computer to share.
I wonder if &quot;they&quot; will try for copyright infringements??

Beep Beep,
HapyBus
