Subject: bus sighting- Sega Dreamcast &quot;Toy Commander&quot;

My daughter got a Sega Dreamcast videogame player and loves the game
&quot;Toy Commander&quot;, where you get to be a mobile toy in various rooms of a
house and go seek things while trying to stop your rival from getting
there first.  One of the choices is a splitty 21 window bus!!!!
