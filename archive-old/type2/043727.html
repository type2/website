Subject: [T2] RE: NOS Carbs (correction)

&gt; I just obtained six 30PICT carbs, brand new Volkswagen brand, for
&gt; $109.95.  These fit the single port engines (thru 1970) and have
&gt; 12 volt chokes. These are genuine VW (Brazil), not the
&gt; Brosol/Bocar aftermarket ones normally available.  My part number
&gt; is 113 129 027K.  None more when these six are gone.


A listmember who got one of these just called to point out that they in fact
have mechanical chokes. Just thought I should pass this on.  Do have 3 left
at this point, by the way.
