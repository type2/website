Get the Dellorto Tech Book. If your local dealer doesn't have it, order it
from CB Performance Products, 1715 N. Farmersville Blvd., Farmerville, CA
93223. Their telphone number is (209)733-8222. The book mostly covers DRLA's
but it has quite a bit of info on the FRDs as well, should have all the info
you need.

&gt; I have recently bought a '73 model bus with dual Dellorto Model FRD 34B 
&gt;carburetors.  I need to adjust the idle speed, and I have no idea where to 
&gt;start.  Does anyone know how to adjust these, and is there anyway that I
could 
&gt;obtain an instruction book/sheet on these carbs?
