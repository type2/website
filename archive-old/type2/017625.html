&gt; have them try &amp; trace the short! ( By-the-By $113.00 for a fab. Fuel filler

&gt; used,,,,We'll see how well it works!?!)
&gt;         To the point of this letter,,,
&gt; Everytime I turn on my lights my alternater light comes on (faintly), when I
&gt; use my turn signal or brake, the Alt. light gets brighter.(Only with the
&gt; headlight switch on, NOT the parking lights, the Alt. light wont even
&gt; glimmer, Only with headlamps on,,,,,Hmmmmmm???
&gt;     ANYONE have any ideas???????
&gt; Oh Yeah,,,,,77 Transporter Automatic with FI.

What you have is a voltage drop problem.  When you put the extra load
on, the battery voltage being supplied to the fron of the bus is
dropping a bit (1 or 2 volts, probably.)  This is due to some high
resistance somewhere in the big wire/connections that bring the current
up to the front fuse panel.  The ALT light is connected with one side to
the ignition switched hot wire and the other to a special, different
wire from the alternator.  The light will glow whenever the difference
between the two exceeds a volt or three.  It normally does its
indicating function when the alternator output voltage, as sensed by the
extra wire, drops off.  If the other, supply voltage, drops off, it will
glow also, since it doesn't care about polarity.  You should be able to
find the problem by putting on the headlights (engine running) for a few
minutes, and just feeling all the connections on the big red (I think
it's red) wire feeding battery voltage from the back to the front.  The
high resistance will be warm (or hot- take care).  Alternatively, start
checking to ground from all the places you can get to on the power
feed.  At some point, you'll find a drop of a volt or three on one side
of the fault and almost none on the other.  If it's a wire, you may need
to replace it, if a connection, try cleaning it up.
