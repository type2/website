&gt;and the 009 is &quot;space age&quot; technology? This Cracks me up!

I was merely making the point that Volkswagen distributors when found in 
crates in peoples basements
are 25 years old and not trustworthy enough to use (IMHO) on a brand new 
engine. Your vacuum advance 
stops working and you blow the motor, all because you want to have blind 
faith in VW's stock distributor. I advise YOU to 
read Muir on the why centrifigal advance is more reliable than vacum.  

&gt;This argument is ridiculous at best

What I'm saying is Learn to drive your volkswagen! If it means riding the 
clutch alittle to smooth the dead spot, then do it. Don'be a baby about a 
little hesitation!!!!!
