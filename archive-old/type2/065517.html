 jblp_at_zone_dot_ca (Jean-Baptiste Le Pesant) writ:

In the region of 
Quebec and there is a club for westfalia. I make a demand to join the 
club. But I can't because my westie doesn't have a pop-top. 

So I wrote:
Hmmm... Not to fan the flames of national stereotypes or anything,
but aren't the Quebecois a bit, uh, exclusionary in other areas of
public life as well? I would never accuse them of being improperly snooty
or anything. They are just so SPECIAL.  ;-)

Stick with the type2list Jean-Baptiste. You can be in OUR club.
