&gt; 81 to 91 126 is [USA] 300SD and the 380 + 420 + 500 + 560 V8's. 123 is 77

&gt; unless it is a total, I doubt you'd find any in the yards.....
&gt; More than likely, you will find the 116 and 123's.

Found older junked MB cars at the junkyard; Up to the mid-'80s models.
The newer ones probably go to 'automotive recyclers' that specialize
in late model MB parts.

If you cannot find a used part in a junkyard, a new one may be found
at an aftermarket MB parts supplier.  Or found at any MB dealership.
MB stocks parts for their cars for approx 30 years after their
manufacture.(what a great concept)    
What is the Mercedes-Benz part no on that wheel nut?

Best of luck,
