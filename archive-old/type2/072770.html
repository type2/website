IT'S ALIVE!!!.  She breathes, She Purrs.

Better yet she doesn't leak.  After 3 months of building a (what I thought
was a) spare engine, the turn of the key and she fires right up. I finally
put the new engine back in last night, attached the final tubes and wires
this afternoon and crossed my fingers.

I pumped the starter  a couple of minutes without power to the coil to
prime the oil system (filled the filter with oil before I installed it).
Never got the warning lite to go completely out but close enough.
Connected the #15 wire on the coil and held my breath.  Arrah
Arrah...roeemmmmmm, she fired right up.  The idle seemed a little high.
1800 on the tach.  I must have the advance alittle to far advanced but
that's OK for now as that the speed I need for the 20 minute run in.

22 minutes later she's resting comfortably.  Shut down without a problem,
no leaks, no clangs.  I've got a box fan on her underside to bring her temp
down so I can check the valves and reset the tuning. I feel like Dr
&quot;Swarts-a-shinken&quot; (rough German for burnt bacon) with my new &quot;creation&quot;
It hasn't sounded this good since I drove it off the showroom floor June
7th, 1977.

Watch out world!

Blackham's on the road again!

Have fun
