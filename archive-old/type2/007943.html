For those interested, the following information pertains to possible bus tire
replacements ...

Passenger car tire information was taken from the ETRTO book:

            LOAD          OUTSIDE   MAX INFL    LOAD    SPEEDO  INDICATED
 TIRE SIZE  RANGE  WIDTH  DIAMETER   PRESS    CAPACITY  ERROR    _at_65 MPH
  *185R14    SL    7.40    25.59      33        1323     0.0%       65
 **185R14    RF    7.40    25.59      44        1477     0.0%       65

Commercial vehicle tire information was taken from the ETRTO book:

            LOAD          OUTSIDE   MAX INFL    LOAD    SPEEDO  INDICATED
 TIRE SIZE  RANGE  WIDTH  DIAMETER   PRESS    CAPACITY  ERROR    _at_65 MPH
   185R14    6PR   7.40    25.59      54        1709     0.0%       65

Since the above tires are based on a European standard, the following tires
will be much easier to find in North America:

Passenger car tire information was taken from the T&amp;RA book:

            LOAD          OUTSIDE   MAX INFL    LOAD    SPEEDO  INDICATED
 TIRE SIZE  RANGE  WIDTH  DIAMETER   PRESS    CAPACITY  ERROR    _at_65 MPH
*P195/75R14   SL   7.72    25.51      35        1400     0.3%       65
 P195/75R14   XL   7.72    25.51      41        1521     0.3%       65
 P205/70R14   SL   8.19    25.35      35        1433     0.9%       66

Light truck tire information was taken from the T&amp;RA book:

            LOAD          OUTSIDE   MAX INFL    LOAD    SPEEDO  INDICATED
 TIRE SIZE  RANGE  WIDTH  DIAMETER   PRESS    CAPACITY  ERROR    _at_65 MPH
LT195/75R14   C    7.72    25.51      50        1435     0.3%       65
LT195/75R14   D    7.72    25.51      65        1710     0.3%       65

Even though the above are standards, you will find tire companies producing
tires outside these standards.

   SL = standard load
   XL = extra load
   RF = reinforced construction
ETRTO = European Tire &amp; Rim Technical Organization (European equivalent to
T&amp;RA)
 T&amp;RA = Tire &amp; Rim Association (North American equivalent to ETRTO)

 * Probably does not have enough load capacity for even passenger buses
** This tire is recommended by Continental for passenger buses.  Commercial
configurations, including camper conversions, will probably specify higher load
rated tires.
