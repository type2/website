I had gas in my oil when I first bought my 76 bus.  I noticed it when the oil
light came on even though it was full and then I smelled it.  It was caused by
one of my plugs not firing due to a bad wire.  It ran like crap because it was
only using 3 cylinders.  The offending cylinder would fill with gas and the gas
was forced around the piston into the oil I guess.  A simple tune up fixed it
for me.
