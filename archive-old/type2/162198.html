I saw the plates are damaged beyond repair.

&gt; Then the same scenario (but can't remember if this one is  
&gt; disconnected)
&gt; on the 12v.  Been &lt; year.  Same q's as above, or I'm thinking this one
&gt; should be fine as it's not sat so long.

Before taking any voltage readings, with the engine off, turn on the  
headlights for 15 minutes to remove any surface charge from the  
battery then turn the lights off and take your measurements.
