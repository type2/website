Subject: front hub rolling resistance spec?

While pranking around with my passenger side wheel (trying to fix a squeaky
brake pad), I noticed the hub doesn't spin very freely.
Takes solid effort to spin it, and won't freewheel.
All the bearings are new  - less than 3000 miles - and there is plenty of
grease. Is there TOO much grease? Can you have TOO much grease, and would
it affect rolling resistance?  I didn't see any signs of heating on the
bearings and races, but the grease seems a tad runny, so maybe it gets
hotter than it should due to this problem...   whatever it is.

BTW, endplay is fine, and the hub has about the same amont of rolling
resistance whether tight or loose.
