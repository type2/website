Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust port gaskets at heads.

From: Sage Green:

Let me change my question from:
 
&quot;&quot;Anybody?? Is there a difference (other than VW part number) in the 1700 
 and in the 1800-2000 exhaust port gaskets? &quot;&quot; to:
 
 &quot;&quot;Anybody?? Is there a difference (other than VW part number) in the 1700 
 and in the 1800 exhaust port gaskets? &quot;&quot;
 
 They are listed with different VW numbers AND DIFFERENT PRICES at bus boys 
 and bus depot.

Good question Barry....

I am not sure where Bus Depot and Bus Boys got that 039 256 251 part number.
The ETKA shows one part number from 72 to 78:  021 256 251A
The 039 number does not appear in any exhaust listing.
