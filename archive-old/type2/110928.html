Subject: Out of state travel to pick up a bus

I'm working on a deal on a Bus in Nevada.  gotta sell the wife on the
idea, come up with the cash, and then strike the deal. 
 
Any suggestions on buying a bus from another state?  I've gotten some
good pics and it looks like a great deal.  Travel will cost me about
$100-$120.  BTW its a '77, body looks perfect, runs but has a dropped
valve, and has a clear title.  Interior seems to be missing the back
side cabinent and the fridge.

I'd be towing it, btw.  I've got access to either a flatbed or a
dolly.  since busses are RWD, I'm thinking the flatbed is the way to
go.
