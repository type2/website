Subject: hydraulic or not?

Should I get a bus with hydraulic lifters or solid lifters.  I've always
had solid lifters for the past 15 years but now I've found a bus with
hydraulics (78).  I was just reading the articles in the library on
fixing and bleeding and adjusting the hydraulics and I'm wondering just
how much better it is compared to the solids...

any advise would be nice :)

Thanks,
Mike
