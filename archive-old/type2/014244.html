Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Another fuel line question



&gt; Just a suggestion, But I got my fuel line at a motorcycle shop... right
&gt; dimensions and extra thick wall,, it is clear though

Be very cautious of clear hose.  Some varieties will stiffen up and crack.  Remember that on a motorcycle the hoses are out in the open 
and easily checked.  Not so in a bus!

Most motorcycle shops will also carry black hose in metric sizes.  They're a good source of such items.
