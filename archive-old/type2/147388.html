Subject: [Fwd: Re: [Fwd: Re: [T2] My First Oil Change]]

Hey T better than that just don't mess with it at all unless you really
have to.  The oilfilter  does all you need it to and way more than that
screen does..  Also most torque wrenches don't go down to 9 ft-lbs
later and have fun  Mark Dearing

Yeh, but it's a good thing to look there on a newly acquired bus and 
perhaps periodically- I found pieces of piston ring and compression ring 
in mine - no cause for alarm then because it was junk from damage 
already repaired (I did a compression check just to make sure) - but I 
do check occasionally, any new junk and I know I've got a problem if I 
hadn't any other indicators.  Same reason I strain my oil - you want to 
know sooner rather than later.  If I found any bits in my oil I would 
immediately pull the screen and check carefully.  I use my fingers or a 
small screwdriver or dental pick to very gently feel around the edges in 
there - that's how I discovered the pieces - had to tease 'em out.

Just proceed with gentleness and caution and get the right tool to 
ensure that your torque is to spec.  Though I agree that if you can't do 
it right, don't do it at all.

T
