Subject: Re: [T2] need help with wiring... 78 FI

The oil pressure wire should come from the harness that goes through the
bottom right side of the engine comp. firewall.

There is another wire from the same harness that goes to the coil +

There should be a single wire near the left taillight harness for the fuel
pump, which also goes on the coil +

There is a single wire from the FI harness (from the ECU) which also goes to
the coil -

The distributor wire goes to coil -

Ask me how I know...

Hi, I have pulled the engine and replaced it.  I thought I did a wonderful
job
of marking everything, putting it in baggies, marking it... anyway. Motor
in,
gas in, one wire melted....

So where do the wires go?  I am having a problem with the coil wires and the
wires that go to the oil sender unit.....

I have a Haynes and the diagram is microscopic....  I looked on the
library.... found the diagram...  but that doesn't work for me....
