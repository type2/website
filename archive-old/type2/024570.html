X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Yesterday I was looking at the local buy and sell and found a guy that had
1800cc heads for a VW for $30ea. I called and he still had them, but when I
got there to look them over, I found that they were cracked. I told him I
was not willing to pay $30 each for them, so he gave them to me Free. The
crackes are not in the combustion chamber, but in the exhaust ports. I
looked in the Wilsons book, and he says that those cracks will not hurt
anything, just may make some noise. Should I try to run them as is, or can
they be welded and at what cost? Luckily he had the heads bead blasted so
they were super clean and the cracks were easy to find. The seats are not
dropped, and the valves and all look real good. Should I use them, weld
them, or toss them?
