Subject: Engine swap?...that's nothing

Let me jump in on this one.   There's a long time VW bus guy here on
Long Island that went about swapping engines in a much different
manner.  He bought himself a Toyota van and cut the body off about 12
inches above the floor.  Then he cut the body off his 66 bus and
grafted it onto the Toyota chassis.  It doesn't look exactly like a
bus but he's got himself a 20/20 conversion.  It looks right if he
drives by at 20 MPH or you look at it from 20 feet away.  To say the
least, he's happy that he's got more power and real heat.  It's still
a work in progress and the interior is kinda rough but that doesn't
stop him from driving it to shows and campouts.
