Subject: Jerricans

I must have ranted on this before...Wedco makes a fabulous jerrican:

http://homepage.mac_dot_com/ratwell/.Pictures/Tools2/15-Wedco.jpg

I was looking to purchase another over the internet because they  
won't sell them in CA, but was stopped dead in my tracks by the  
vendor because, &quot;DUE TO STATE REGULATIONS, THIS PRODUCT CANNOT BE  
SHIPPED TO THE FOLLOWING STATES: California, Connecticut, Delaware,  
District of Colombia, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New  
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Orders with shipping  
addresses to the above locations will be automatically cancelled.&quot;

This is crazy! This is the only can that real seals and prevents  
spills. The absurdity of these air quality boards that make limit  
your choices to this POS that always spills gas all over you car:

If you haven't used one of these spouts, the fuel flows sideways!  
from the end of the spout and it's not long enough to go into the  
fuel take pipe of many vehicles. The video even shows you how to vent  
the gas can which is the entire point of that stupid spout in the  
first place.

I'm really motivated to campaign against these stupid cans before the  
jerrican is forced out of production.
