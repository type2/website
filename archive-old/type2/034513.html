  question (long)

Marv, You're better off buying the new part. I got one some years back from
Bus Boys. You can take the thing apart by carefully bending the tangs at
the bottom and then prying the cap off. When you do, you will find 2 plates
and at least one spring, I think--it's been a while.

The problem is, these brass/copper plates will be worn where the contacts
occur. Even though you can bend them a little, my experience was that it
took more brain cells to figure it out that were worth the $35 or so I had
to spend on the new part...and the fix only worked for a short
time...meaning I had to pull the ignition switch AGAIN! Arrrrrrgh! It's
been years, but I still quiver at the thought; I recall being as frustrated
with this as you describe.

Highly recommend buying the new part and then tearing down the old to see
how it's made.

Have fun! Joe
