&gt; So...what are the differences in the IRS setups from year to year. There 
&gt; are differences...aren't there?

On Manual Trans, the IRS Axles &amp; CVs are the same thru 79, left &amp; right

There are differences on other stuff though:

69-70:
Long Axle Stub thru the Bearing Housing, for the 5-205 Drum

1971:
Went to the shorter Axle Stub for the 5-112 Drum (same thru 91 Vanagon I believe).  Bearing Housing changed to account for the smaller OD Outer Bearing used from 71-91 Bus/Vanagon.

72-79:
Control Arms and Spring Plates changed (I think both slightly longer to accommodate repositioning of the trans for the Type 4 engine in the USA) At least that's what the Microfiche plate says.

That's the major stuff I know
