Subject: Re: recently rebuilt starter/solenoid sticking?

&gt;&gt; it just wouldn't play ball.  Nothing I couldn't fix by whacking it sharply
&gt;&gt; with a 15&quot; length of wooden clothes rod, but doing that downtown on
&gt;&gt; Broadway in a coat and tie is undignified.

I know this may sound like a dumb question, but what the heck does 
banging on the starter/solenoid do? Is something stuck? Starter gear? Are 
you banging the electrons into submission?
