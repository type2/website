Gentlepersons-
                       ...Having gone the route of importing a car from 
&quot;just&quot; Canada, I second the opinion of checking with US Customs, before doing 
anything. The rules are very
strict, and they don't smile at all at the borders. The info I got prior to 
my journey was
adamant about not taking anybody's word for anything. Even if you could 
conceivably
drive one to the border, the agents could impound the vehicle right there, 
right now.
Shipping one would be even harder...It could end up on a dock, frozen in 
paperwork and
you'd be out the cost of the Bus and the shipping fees. The only vehicles 
that get a free
pass, so to speak, are those old enough to predate the regs (how my 
basket-case Mor-
gan, 1962 4/4, squeaked through...), even at that the customs man wanted to 
&quot;see&quot; the
VIN number...Morgans of that age didn't have VIN numbers, just serial numbers 
on the
chassis. I spent a few hours talking to supervisors before they let the 
collection of parts through.
             Unless you're thinking of smuggling one in under the wire, 
registration would 
have to be via another Bus title and number plates...Don't get caught at that 
either, the
fines run into the many thousands...
             On the lighter side, you might know a Brazilian Johnny Cash, who 
could bring you a couple of parts each trip...Anybody remember that tune?
