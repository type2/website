Hi all,

I have included a link to the web page that has tons of particulars and pictures about the above camper bus.

There is also an offer of a possible fun &quot;Bonus&quot; when the bus is purchased, and some freebie gifts with the bus too!  Info at the link below as well.   I am listing the bus here and at wetwesties before putting it up on some classifieds.

Thank you,
