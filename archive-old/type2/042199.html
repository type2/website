Subject: Re: master cylinder replacement and brake bleeding

[...]
The problem I see is with a 68-70 resivoir with 5 holes. My much messier
process is to install the reservoir, fill, and submerge all of the open
ports in a bucket of brake fluid, pump manually until no bubbles, wipe and
install. the bucket of fluid is still fresh so i dump it back into the
containers and use it for the bleeding proper.
messy but workable.

&gt; Hey Marcus --
&gt; I second the recommendation on bench bleeding.  What this means:
&gt; 1) Buy a length of brake line [say 12&quot;-18&quot;] with metric end fittings
&gt; suitable for the master cylinder output ports, i.e., the same as your
&gt; VW brake tube fittings.  Should be a buck or two at discount parts
&gt; store.
&gt; 2) Cut the new brake line in half.  Clean burrs/chips from the cut
&gt; ends.
&gt; 3) Bend each piece into a broad 'C' shape -- you want the cut end to
&gt; be near the bottom of the reservoir and the fitting end in the output
&gt; port.  Tighten the fittings.
&gt; 4) Clamp this assembly on your bench [gently if you use a vise]; fill
&gt; with clean/fresh brake fluid.  Then use a dowel to depress the piston.
&gt; You will see bubbles of air rising in the reservoir.
&gt; 5) Press and release repeatedly, until you see no more bubbles in the
&gt; reservoir.  At this point your master cylinder is free of trapped air
&gt; and ready to install.  Take out the 'C' lines and save them in a clean
&gt; plastic bag in your tool cabinet!
