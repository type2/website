&gt; Did you use a clutch alignment tool when you put the pressure plate and
&gt; clutch disc on? If the clutch disc is even off 1mm to one side, it will not
&gt; mate up. Check that the clutch disc is absolutely centred in the pressure
&gt; plate. The alignment tools are about 2 bucks from most sources.

Or, if you have a mini-mag-light flashlight it works perfectly as a pilot
tool!
