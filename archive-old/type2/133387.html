&gt; &gt; Howdy. I've been trying to help a friend of mine with his '77 Automatic
&gt; &gt; bus,
&gt;
&gt; just a shot in the dark here, but since it's an auto I was thinking.
&gt; Could it be stuck in gear? I know it shouldn't even try and start in
&gt; gear, but I suppose it could.

if it &quot;clicks&quot; then it can start,  an Automatic has no trouble starting in
gear it is only an electrical switch in the shift mechnism that prevents
it.  (I started mine in first once to get it home when the shift cable
broke, wife stood on brake while I used my rear starter switch)
