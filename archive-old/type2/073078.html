Pull engine, remove flywheel, replace seal, note excessive endplay, realize
there is nothing I can do about it right now because our sole
transportation has its engine out. Install new clutch disc. Button it all
back together. Adjust clutch. Clean up. Two hours and 20 minutes.

It takes me longer than that to make lasangna. =^ )

At least it stopped the leak for now. I am getting WAY better at engine
pulls than I want to be.
