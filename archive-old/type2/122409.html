Subject: lube pilot bearing

I found this neat tip at aricooled_dot_net wrt distributor grease:

&gt; This high temperature grease won't fly out onto your points like vaseline, or
&gt; other greases! STICKY to stay on the distributor shaft. You should put some of
&gt; this on every 3k miles. This is also GREAT for input shaft and throwout
&gt; bearings (inside the gland nut or flywheel), since it won't get hot and then
&gt; fly out onto your clutch! Also used for generator or alternator bearings. This
&gt; is a must for your garage.

Has anyone tried this on the pilot bearing?
