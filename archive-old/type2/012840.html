I know you guys are probably getting tired of me, but I am still looking
for a Type IV engine for my 74 Westy.  I have had absolutely no luck
finding a used one, except for a 914 engine in California, and a 1700 in
Pennsylvania.  Was hoping to find something a little closer to Texas.
I have a non-running but complete 72 hardtop Westy to offer in trade.

Thanks,
Ed Maikranz
Abilene, Texas
