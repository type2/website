Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Hoses for 2.0 FI '78 Westy

&gt; I would like to know where to get new 12mm (?) fuel line which
&gt; is used between the fuel filter and the fuel pump.  It seems to
&gt; me that this size is difficult to find, and is often neglected.
&gt; Is there a Mercedes-Benz part number for this fuel line also?

Yes, there is a Mercedes part number for the 10mm fuel hose. [not 12mm]
It is 112 476 12 26
It is a little expensive at $15.50 [list price] a meter. Not sure if your
local MB dealer will sell you part of a meter......39 1/4&quot; is a lot of hose
:)
