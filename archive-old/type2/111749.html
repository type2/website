&gt; Only not so mangled. And if it falls into an oil gallery, you'll have to split
&gt; the halves to retreive it. Ask me how I know...

If you accidently drop it in, don't panic!  Don't do anything, actually!
They make magnetic parts retrievers with really strong neodymium magnets
these days that sometimes can snatch steel parts back from the abyss.
Give one of them a try before you split the case!
