Subject: [T2] Bad Valves?

    Hello to You all.

    I have a simple question, i'm reparing my 1600cc (sp) engine from my 69
Bus, I'm gonna get new cilinders, pistons, ring's, etc. I've just removed my
valves and i would like to know how a bad valve look's like. They are very
black but i think that a good clean would just do it. Is there anything else
that i should considerate to know if the valves are damaged?

    Thank's to You ALL.
