Subject: Re:  HELP ME !!! 

Is the hole oriented such that you can reach it from both the inside and 
the outside? And is there any clearance inside the engine at the site of 
the defect? If so, there are several possibilities.

One possible repair would be to place a bolt through the hole, with the 
head of the bolt inside the engine. (You would slip a washer and gasket on 
the bolt before pushing it through the hole from inside the engine.) Then 
you would hold that assembly tight against the inner engine wall, and from 
the outside slip a similar gasket and washer over the protruding threaded 
end of the bolt. Still holding the bolt from inside the engine, you would 
then run a nut onto the thread and tighten it down to hold the washers and 
gaskets firmly against the engine surfaces. You could then thread on a 
second nut and lock the first one in place.  If the surfaces are curved, 
you might be able to fashion and shape washers and gaskets to fit the 
situation. This is something you might accomplish without help.

An alternate approach would be to have a machine shop drill a uniform hole 
in the block at the site of the defect, tap it with threads, and fit a 
short stubby bolt into the hole, much like an oil drain plug. You might 
even consider a gasket, washer and nut on the inside, if there is clearance.

Another direction to explore would be to find a welder who might be able to 
work with the alloy engine block material in an inert gas atmosphere, 
without warping everything until it was useless. Such a craftsman could 
also address any cracks that might exist in the defect.
