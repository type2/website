I have to concur, and my experience still rankles. I described the 
conditions of my core heads with MSHP and said that I did not plan to 
bother shipping them, since they seemed to be worth less than the 
shipping cost. I was assured that I would do no worse than break even on 
postage -- that the scrap value would cover my shipping costs.

So, thinking that I had nothing to lose, I shipped them off at a cost of 
close to $20. Never heard from them again. No core refund. This was 
outright fraud, but so de minimus that I won't do anything about it.

Except tell y'all.
