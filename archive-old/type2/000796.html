Subject: paint my wagon

The previous owner took it upon him/herself to paint ' my wagon ' with a
roller/brush. I certainly don't have the cash to take her back to bare
metal, but do have a paintjob in mind. What I want to do entails a large
amount of stenciling, and is basically only a 3 colour job......
....._dot_can anyone recommend roller/brush hints, paints or alternatives....
and...( I'm in the U.K ) possible outlets/companies.
I have also visited my local hire-supply shop and they hire out cellulose
paint spray guns.....and supply the paint...any warnings here ????

As always I say a large thank you to you all out there who make owning a
' Type 2 ' that much more fun.
