Interesting.  I have used Mobil-1 15W50 almost exclusively for the last ~120,000 miles in my bus and have no major complaints.  I didn't see a significant pressure change between the Mobil-1 and other oils such as Royal Purple synthetic 20W50 and Castrol 20W50 dino.  Haven't tried the Kendall though.

A compression test is always useful, but unless your oil pressure is seriously low (like below 25 on the freeway) I wouldn't worry too much about it.  My oil light often comes on at idle when the engine is hot and it has not caused my engine to fail.  You really don't need much oil pressure at idle.
