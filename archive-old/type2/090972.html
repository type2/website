Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

I had a used Westy that came my way as a near dead and the fellow had
hooked up the reverse light switch so that the van would only start in
reverse.
What a wiring nightmare figuring this out, the starter turned the engine
over but it only started in reverse. Diagram that schematic for me
please.
