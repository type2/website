Subject: Re: [T2] Painting Engine Tin

Hi Jason,

Clean the tin thoroughly, rough it up with steel wool or sandpaper, 
wipe it off and spray it with a couple coats of regular tremclad 
rattle-can enamel. I put two coats on my tin last year and was so happy 
with the results I sprayed the FI components with it this spring as 
well.

I have not had any problems with the paint getting charred, except on 
the rear tin just above the muffler and in front of the fan... And even 
that piece would have been fine if I still had the original heat shield 
installed. I've painted the fan before and it held up fine.

There are pics of the FI'd engine online here:

Happy trails,

&gt; So, my question to The List is, what type of paint did you use?  I 
&gt; would imagine that some hi-heat paint like Rust-Oleum's BBQ paint 
&gt; would work well, but does it come in colors other than flat black?  
&gt; I'm running an aftermarket exhaust and the tin behind (FIF) the fan 
&gt; gets pretty hot, and I'm sure it gets hot enough to burn off regular 
&gt; rattle-can paint.
