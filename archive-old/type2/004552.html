Garp -
5 other wires are there because this is the cabling used for tow bar wiring.
Each colour will have a specific purpose.
Blue for fridge live, yellow for indicators, black for earth etc etc.  You
will need to run the live to the fridge through a relay incidentally.  It
won't last long without.  Any camping or trailer store will have the
standard colour set up and be able to advise on relay wiring.  |It's very
easy to do.  You may even find a wiring diagram on the back of the packet
the relay comes in.
                    Regards, Robert.
