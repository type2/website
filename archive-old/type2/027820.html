You don't have hydraulic lifters unless they have been added.  They didn't 
do hydraulics until about '78 I believe.  It is common, though, for them to 
be added.  I have them in my '76 2.0 since it was rebuilt.

&gt;Ditto, I have had synthetic oil in my '76, 2000, and she purrs like a 
&gt;kitten. She sat for 2 months last year over winter and no problems. &gt;Come 
&gt;to think of it, I don't really know if I have hydraulic lifters. &gt;Can 
&gt;anyone clarify that for me? TIA Shawn Soucy
