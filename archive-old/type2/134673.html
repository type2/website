Subject: Re: [T2] Interior paint

Mark I think if you dig a little deeper you notice that all of your two tone 
buses were transporters and your solids are the campers, at least for the 
Baywindow buses. The two tone buses were all white inside, as well as a 
wholey white bus originally. The one exception (that I am aware of) is the 
Champagne Edition camper, which was two tone brown and white, with the white 
interior. Take a look at some of these brochures and you will see it better:

&gt; whereas buses with a solid color outside have the same color inside.
