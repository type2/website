&gt; Your call.  But definitely have one disposable filter between the fuel tank
&gt; and the fuel pump.  DO NOT PUT IT BETWEEN THE FUEL PUMP AND
&gt; THE CARB(S).  The mechanical VW fuel pump is designed to pull, not push.

Umm, are you sure that you don't have that backwards?

Gasoline is a
volitile fluid with a high vapor pressure.  If you reduce the pressure of
the gasoline by more than about 4PSI by placing a restriction on the inlet
side of the pump, the gas in the line will turn into vapor, which the
pump can't pump.  This condition is called &quot;vapor lock&quot;.  VWs don't vapor
lock much since they have a nearly-gravity-feed system with little
restriction.  If a restriction is placed in the line you increase the
chance of vapor lock.

If you do put a filter upstream of the fuel pump, make sure that it is a
large low-restriction unit.  The normal place for a filter is on the
pressure side of the pump, between the pump and carburator.  I'm not a big
fan of the little filters and find that Pep Boys has a fair selection of
larger filters with the correct hose nipples for various Japanese autos.
Be sure to clamp all connections between the pump and carburator
