Subject: Propane and water tanks

Anybody need the tanks off my 73 HiTop? The 
sink/stove/fridge/whatevertheheck was missing when I got mine, and my wife 
and I decided we don't want to replace it. A folding jump seat is going to 
go where the fridge was.

But the tanks are still attached. At least the propane tank certainly is. I 
dunno about the water, didn't roll under to look for it.

Anyway, anybody in So Cal who wants the stuff drop me a note. I'll 
(hopefully) be pulling them off on Monday. Keep in mind that the bits that 
go through the floor are NOT there.
