Subject: Brake Problems

I've been having some brake trouble with my 1970 bus.  About a year ago it
started pulling violently to the right anytime the brakes were applied. I
checked out the system and found all front wheel cylinders leaking badly,
the shoes shot and the master cylinder (no servo) quite glitchy.   Since
I'm slow it has taken about a year to fix things.  The upshot is that after
replacing the master cylinder (the original had been rebuilt twice)and
wheel cylinders and installing new shoes the beast still pulls right upon
braking.  The brakes bleed well, the brake fluid runs clear and there seems
to be plenty of pressure. The shoes adjust ok and there is plenty of pedal.
Needless to say, I am miffed. The only things that have not been swapped
out are the brake lines and drums. Any wisdom you list folks may have on
this topic would be appreciated.

Thanks
