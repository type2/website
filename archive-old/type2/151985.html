&gt; I have a 1983 aircooled Vanagon that's stranded in my driveway... I'm
&gt; moving out of my place today and need to get it from San Francisco to
&gt; Fred's Garage down in Redwood City (27 miles). Local tow companies are
&gt; quoting me an arm and a leg - in anyone able to help me out with a
&gt; tow?
&gt;
&gt; I can pay $100+ to anyone kind enough to help. Needs to be today,
&gt; preferably around noon.

triple AAA should haul you that distance if you have it, tell em you don't
live there or push it onto the street and tell em it is &quot;Broken&quot; and needs
to get to the garage before your towed
