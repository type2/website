Jed:
Make sure your rear rope is nowhere near the exhaust. poly ropes will melt if
near the exhaust and does that canoe ever move around when the rear rope burns
through!

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you're only going a short distance you can simply make the bed and

&gt; The thing I like about doing that is that you can load all the gear in the
&gt; canoe before you leave for the lake/river.   Then when you get there all you
&gt; do is slide it right in the water and you're ready to go. When you get back
&gt; you do just the reverse, but I put a hunk of plastic over the upholstery.
&gt; I've been doing this for a couple years now.  For long distances, I just
&gt; throw it on the top (no rack), put a couple towels under where the canoe
&gt; rails touch the fiberglass, and tie the front and back to the bumper and tow
&gt; loops.  I've logged hundreds of miles with this setup at 55mph with no
&gt; problems.  I have a 16 ft canoe and, conveniently, it only rests on the
&gt; tough parts of the roof.  YMMV
