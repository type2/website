&gt; Well, I just got done replacing the rotors and brake pads on my '72.
&gt; What should I do with the old rotors? Recycling, reconditioning?? They

&gt; the past?

Take them to a auto machine shop and have them measured to see if they can
be turned.  If so, turn them and you'll have spare rotors.

If they are too worn, they are trash.  Toss 'em or keep them for those
occasions when you need nice flat weights.
