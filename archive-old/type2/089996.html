&lt;&lt; Secondly, I'm trying to figure out the best way to attach a bike rack to
my '71 Westy. I was hoping to use the trailer hitch, but it's a solid
welded german fish-hook ball that does not have a receiver section (i.e.
you can't remove the ball and use the square receiver tube). How have you
best racked your bikes? 

Thanks, and have a great summer sunday... 
Cheers
