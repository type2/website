&gt;&gt; Start off with a solid lifter cam.
&gt;&gt; You can't put solids on a camshaft ground for hydraulics.
&gt;
&gt;True, perhaps, but this gentleman wants to go from solid lifters to
&gt;hydraulics. Many have done this with the solid cam, though a hydraulic cam
&gt;is always nice if you're splitting the case anyway. You need eight hydraulic
&gt;lifters and eight hydraulic pushrods, and since you can pull the lifters on

You really should use the solid spacers as well.  AND sometimes rockers
for solid lifters may have problems on heads that have been cut over 0.020
or so.  But running the hydraulics on a solid lifter cam is OK.  As usual make
sure everything fits alright.
