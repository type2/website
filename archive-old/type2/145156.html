Subject: Re: [T2] Fair price for instrument panel?

&gt; I don't agree. $100 is a good price for a panel
&gt; (assuming that 
&gt; everything's working)&lt;&lt;

In that case, I have one that I'll give you for $75! 
No, I'm just teasing you... But seriously, if anyone
wants one for $75, I have 2 to sell. Otherwise, I'll
just keep them in my parts stash ;^)
Peace, John Baker
