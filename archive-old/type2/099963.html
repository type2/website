&gt; This sounds just like a situation I had with my bug a few years back.  
&gt; After
&gt; lots of replacing fuel filters--in the fuel tank, and the in-line one, 
&gt; I finally
&gt; discovered that the fuel pump rod was worn very short.  For some
&gt; reason, it would drive fine, until it got hot, then act as if it ran 
&gt; out of gas.
&gt; After an hour or so of cooling down, it would run fine again.


I'll second this.  I've had the same issue and found the same problem.  
Now
I not only carry a spare fuel pump, but 2 spare actuating rods (figured 
I'd
buy two at once).  Although I avoided it for a year or two, I finally 
broke down
and bought a fuel pressure tester (it's also a vacuum tester, which is 
something
else I needed) from autozone for $20.  It's worth it's weight to be able 
to
simply check &quot;do I have fuel pressure and is it up to spec (3-5psi)&quot;.
