&gt; You might be able to rig up the '74 air cleaner to 
work with those carbs,

though - the engine 
&gt; won't last long unfiltered.

My 72 came to me with Dellorto frd's mated to a 73 air 
cleaner with tubes that looked like they should be part 
of the heating system. The solexes stick up a few inches 
I believe. These tubes fit over the the carbs fairly 
well but left many gaps where the tube stuck in the air 
cleaner. After a couple years of nursing and atching 
this arrangement I decided my engine should breathe 100% 
filtered air. The solution was a 3 foot length of air 
duct hose, cut in two pieces, and clamps from FLAPS,plus 
a little duct tape to keep the side parts of the air 
cleaner from falling out. I'm guessing that this isn't a 
problem when the bits sit right on the carbs.
pretty is as pretty does :-)
