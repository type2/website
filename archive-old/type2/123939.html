Subject: RE: [T2] accessory plug update-Lighter socket Question

Mostly to charge the cell phone.
Funny how I have radar detectors to find road signs and go 64mph. Even
in the 99EV, everyone blows by me at 90mph. 


...
&lt;&lt; On a simialr note, is there a similar converter to allow the standard
lighter socket in my 70 to run items like radar detectors and battery
chargers? Seems it only likes the lighter...  &gt;&gt;

Radar detector...?-)
You must live in an area where all the roads are downhill...
