&gt; &gt; &gt;From this information I would guess the engine in our
&gt; &gt; camper has been replaced.  But with what?  It certainly
&gt; &gt; looks like a Type 4 engine, but is it a later (and
&gt; &gt; possibly larger) than 1972 and 1700cc?  What other
&gt; &gt; clues can I look for?
&gt; 
&gt; it is either a 1700 or 1800 &quot;real&quot; type 4 engine from a 411 or 412 fast
&gt; back sedan of 1971-1974  they had to have the oil checked from the top
&gt; since there was no rear opening to get to the engine

Could also be out of a Porsche 914 or 912E. They had similar fills and
dipsticks.
With the engine out of the car, it's not too dificult to change this to
the type 2 filler. Maybe a skilled person could drill and tap the
correct holes with the engine in and the muffler and hanger bar removed.
The nicest thing would be to borrow another crankcase to see exactly
what you need to do.
The 14mm locknuts on the lash adjusting screws indicate the engine is
later. I can't remember what year they went to this. 75,76,77? Something
like that.
