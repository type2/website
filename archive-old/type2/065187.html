Subject: Help Needed with Gas Heater Installation(s)

I have recently acquired both a Stewart-Warner Heater and a BN-4 Heater.
While both are reputed to work, I have no experience at all with these
beasts.  OTOH, it would be really, really nice to be warm this winter.

I have (Thanks, Sean!) pretty good directions on installing the Stewart-
Warner unit, but some questions.  I have no idea about the BN-4 and a
certain knowledge that it is incomplete.

Does anyone out there have copies of the owner's manuals, technical
manuals, and/or installation intructions for either of these units?
