Subject: Re: mystery module '72. what the heck is it?

&gt;Hi all;
&gt;       sorry if some of you have already seen this, I am still getting
&gt;acclimated to the vanagon/type2 seperation.  anywho:
&gt;       I was putsing in my engine compartment last weekend when I ran 
&gt;across what appears to be some sort of electric vacuume switch mounted to 
&gt;the top center of my engine compartment.  It is attached to the drivers 
&gt;side bolt which secures the heater blower fan to the top center of the 
&gt;engine compartment.  It has a two pronged electrical connection on the 
&gt;side and a vaccume hookup on either end.  There is a wire in the vicinity 
&gt;of the module that looks like it would attach to it.  the other end of 
&gt;the wire runs to the test block on the passanger side of the bus with all 
&gt;the other wires.  If anyone could tell me what this little guys function 
&gt;is and how to  plumb it up I would be greatly thankful.
&gt;thanks.

        At temps below 12C  the automatic vacuum  advance operates in all
gears. Above 12C it operates only in top gear. The vacuum switch (two way
cut off) is operated by a temperature sensor and a switch on the
transmission. The hook up is as follows: Hose from vacuum control unit on
distributor to control valve (side with adjustment screw and two prongs).
Hose from other side of valve to carb. Wire from control valve switch to
terminal 15 current circuit. Wire from other prong ( I can't identify one
from the other they are unmarked(I have the switch in hand as I type)to
temperature sensor in engine compartment and on/off switch on transmission.
When I bought my 72 both vacuum hoses were connected directly to the carb
and the diaphram was disabled. Hope this helps.
