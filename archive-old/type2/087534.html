Subject: what luck!

wow! i told you about my free white stag tent gift without some poles! we
learned those were obsolete, and i'd given up on them, then snoopy sent
measurements for what was missing, and an hour later the remaining poles in
pristine condition are found and brought over in their original tent pole
bag! life is grand, and i'm flippin' out   - steve
