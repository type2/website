&gt; Sticking my nose into other people's business again.  Probably get me
&gt; flamed, but I gotta say it anyway:
&gt; 
&gt; If at all possible, keep the damned thing.  Put it in an attic.  Use it as
&gt; an end table in your house.  Whatever.  But keep it.
&gt; 
&gt; Even though you may find it useless, if you ever sell you Westy, a potential
&gt; buyer might not buy because of lack of original equipment.  And who knows?

I fully agree! IFA?
