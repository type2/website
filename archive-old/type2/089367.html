Subject: Re: [T2] '79 Picture of  Side Door Guts

I will try to remember this. I am very slowly stripping the '79 Westy. I
have taken some photos, but I need to get film to take more. I could take a
few digital photos, perhaps. I've never uploaded digital photos to this
computer yet. I'm probably going to take the whole door because the door on
the latest '71 has some damage. I'm not certain that they will work
together.
I remember this question from before. Sorry, but I have been super busy.
I'll try to get some photos.

&gt; this year shown.  Can anyone help?
