Fun stuff at www.slobonium_dot_com Its a great take off on the current
incarnations of VW ad's, using the older micro.

Since it's Friday and I can say almost anything I want, I get to beam about
the following:
I have lived in San Francisco for the past 6 years and just moved to San
Diego for a new job. My bus is staying at my place in SF (which I am
keeping) and I am buying a used 88 Cabriolet to jet around down here. (I
hear that they use actual water to cool the engine, how weird!)

I expect to spend many weekends up and down the coast in either car, the
next few years should be really fun. Can't wait to take either car into baja
for a weekend. Am told that Anza Borrego is a &quot;don't-miss&quot; in the spring
when the flowers bloom.

Anyone down here know a great aircooled mechanic? (Not good, great!)

-Peter
