Subject: [T2] Maintenance Logs

Someone on the list - I think it's Don (who is on the road right now) 
has a friggin' Excel spreadsheet for all kinds of maintenance data.

I have a  small spiral-bound notebook (I think its a steno pad) with a 
ballpoint pen stuck in the spiral .

Anyhoo, it's the perfect set-up for me.  I simply log each fill-up 
(date, gallons, price, odometer) and from that I can calculate MPG.

When I have filled the page, that is roughly 3,000 miles, so I start a 
new page with the tune-up data such as what I replaced, which valves 
had to be adjusted, and other work I did in conjunction with the 
tune-up (like brakes or what-have-you).

I transfer all that to my computer (Excel) for each page that I fill 
and it has all kinds of calculators for pertinent data.
