&gt; It seems that there are grooves in the window glass itself that STILL HAS
&gt; material let in it.  This makes me question, how could a grid line in a VW
&gt; rear window be CUT or BROKEN so as to lose all continuity from end to end??

the lines are wide, but not very thick.  30 years of corrosion will have
converted some of the metal to oxide which does not conduct well

&gt; In the past, I was able to measure voltage at one side of the window, and at
&gt; the other side (down current, so to speak) of the window, and there was a
&gt; real drop in voltage.  [I would have measured 'current' if I had any decent
&gt; concept of electricity]  I imagined that the grid was working somewhere, but
&gt; not generating any heat.

These grids do not really produce a lot of heat.  they warm the local
glass by just a few degrees, enough to defog the glass if it has become
misted.

If the voltage drop was considerable, then you might have a problem in the
wiring that supplies the grid.  If the wiring has all the voltage drop,
then you won't see much current through the grid.  You really need to
measure the current and voltage and compare to a known good window.
