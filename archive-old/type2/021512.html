Subject: Thinking about rebuild.

Hi folks,

First of all, thanks for all the help that so many of you have given
me.  I wish that I could return the favor!  But I do not know enough,
and since I am no mechanic I am probably causing my 82 more damage than
good.

I bought my bus because I fell in love with it, still do.  No matter
what the problems, I cannot give her up.  1982, with only 100,000 km.
The problem is though in the last five years prior to my buying it, it
was driven less than 500 km.  Yes that's right, 500 km.  I had to
replace all four tires ($300.00), rear brake cylinder ($200.00), parts
for tune-up ($75.00), valve and push tube seals ($30.00).  Plus the gas
tank had to be replaced, for it had rotted through but I forced the
dealership to replace that on their dime because it is covered under
Ontario Safety.  I had to cut the EGR pod out since it had rotted out.

All of the above has not swayed me one iota.  If fact, I naturally
anticipated most of this, given the fact that it is twenty years old!
But now frustration with the ongoing oil weeping is getting the better
of me.  It started about three weeks ago, and under advise of some
friends, I did the valve covers gaskets and push rod tube seals myself.
It reminded me why I chose not to be a mechanic in life!

I still have a significant oil leak.  I have a fairly good coating of
oil forming on the rear bumper, hatch and window.  There is oil dripping
of the block, the fan housing, the engine bracket and both exchangers.

To top it off, my poor baby is developing quite a constant &quot;coughing&quot; on
deceleration and down shifting.  Not quite a backfire, but a definite
sputtering.  I have no noticeable loss of power, and no hesitation.  I
can kick the girl up to 120km on level ground with no problem!

So, I am thinking about biting the bullet, and pulling the engine out.
But I can't do it.  I do not have a lot of money to spend on the
dealerships, in fact my local dealer doesn't want me to bring the
Vanagon back as he has no interest in working on &quot;old timers&quot;.

Does anybody know a good mechanic in the southern Ontario area?  Someone
both reputable and genuinely interested in keeping these gems on the
road?  I live just north of Toronto, and I will gladly drive within 2 -
3 hours to take it to someone.  I do not have the facilities to pull the
engine, and certainly not the knowledge.

I want to have the engine all fixed up, running great.  I can do all the
preventative maintenance that I can, but I am not a mechanic.  Never
will be.

Thanks again,
Eric
82 Vanagon.
