&gt; From: George Lyle 
	[]  
&gt; Fifth, you need to provide a protective coating.  I've found that
&gt; petroleum jelly makes and excellent coating.  
	[]  
	Just a quick &quot;Me Three&quot; on the petroleum jelly. I've been doing this
for 
	20 years. My dad did it for 50+ years. After you put the terminal
on, smear 
	an extra coating over top of the whole clamp. You'll never have a
coroded 
	battery cable again. Nor will you ever have startign problems due to
loose, dirty 
	coroded cables.
