Subject: Need piston

About 5000 miles ago I rebuilt my 1600 engine (1971, type II) and
upgraded with 87mm pistons, making it a 1650. A valve broke while
driving and went through the piston head.  No one wants to sell a single
piston.  Anyone know where I might be able to find a single 87mm piston?

I was even considering replacing the engine all together.  If I could
find an 1800, would it fit where my 1600 was?  Would any modification be
required?
