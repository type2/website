Unless something has changed in the last year, a 1971 vehicle should not
have to pass any standards at 2500 rpm.  Only idle is checked.

&gt;        My 71 poptop with a stock everything engine is running great 20
&gt;        mph _at_ 55mph, 180-200 oil temp, but California is telling me that
&gt;        I am way over on CO (there was no 2500 rpm test in 71 so how
&gt;        would they know what is correct anyway)

For some reason, they test it and it shows up on the printouts (always has)
but there was no standard, so no matter what the readings were, you passed
(as long as idle emissions were okay).  What is &quot;way over&quot; on CO anyway?
If you're over 5%, there is probably something wrong with your engine.  It
shouldn't be hard to get a '71 to pass, even with 2500 rpm standards.

&gt;        I have been told to jet the main down to .122 to pass and then
&gt;        put the .127 back in to prevent LEAN-BURN.

That would probably work.  Also try retarding your timing a little.

Again, if something has changed in the smog laws since I left California
earlier this year, then forget everything I just said.
