Subject: distrib. request turns into a project
Message-ID: &lt;53f3f1c4.247acc89_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

originally requesting a correct dizzy, i have been launched into a project.

engine in question....a 1972 *EA* from a 72   411.  stock dual carbs. 
(purchased like this over 4 yrs ago. of  trouble free service)

karl suggested to me to find out my exact tdc, to determine if PO had done a 
combination swap of 411 parts and late bus engine parts to arrive at my 
current engine configuration.  as of right now my tdc correlates to the *O* 
which lines up perfectly with the notch in the timing plug hole (on top).  

for 4 yrs i have been timing it, and setting valves incorrectly.  i have 
always used the little *v* notch on the face of the fan, and lined it up with 
the *0* on my timing scale.

this is obviously way wrong, according to my tdc findings a few minutes ago.  
if all this is true how do i correlate the timing scale markings to the 
notch, redmark, and *o* which are only visible thru the top timing hole??? i 
need to get this tuned today.....help........
