&gt;IMHO, it's kind of a long shot.  Unless I saw an independent test of
&gt;the device by a reputable organization I wouldn't go for it.


Bob, FWIW, I have the Jacob's set-up.  I don't think its the &quot;omni magnum team&quot; model, but I don't recall the actual name.  Anyway, it does seem to work (though, for various reasons, I don't have much more than 2000 miles on it). These are my thoughts on it:

1.  It draws a lot of power--I forget the figure, but its like 7 amps (?).  Jacobs does not advertise this fact (I had to ask the not very knowledgeable sales staff and go through several layers of staff to get the answer), but if you add a 7(?) amp draw to wipers, headlights, etc... you are starting to stress a 30 amp (or even a 38 amp) generator--I recall reading somewhere on the list that one should not continuously run a generator (or alternator) near the max. output--you might want to verify that.  I do recall that after install, my ammeter showed a significant draw on the battery (as I recall, the Jacobs system drew power directly from the battery, so I could read the draw from the system on the ammeter).  Anyway, unless you've converted or plan to convert to the 50 amp alternator (which I did), I think that the Jacobs set-up draws too much power.  When I mentioned my concern that the unit drew too much power for a 30 amp generator, the sales person said, &quot;Well, it might be better if you upgraded to an alternator.&quot;  I replied that (1) if that's what was required, they should so state in the advertising and (2) that the alternator install was a significant modification since it involves removing the motor.

2.  It seems that Jacobs always has a &quot;limited time&quot; sale offer--so if you call Jacobs directly and are told that there is a limited time sale and you should buy now b/f the sale expires, don't worry.  This bit of sales chicanery, by which I was suckered, left me feeling ripped off.

3.  Jacobs suggests modifying plug gap and timing after installation of the new system, but the otherwise excellent instructions don't really tell you how to do this.  Jacobs does offer to sell you a book that discusses the subject--which I was too annoyed to purchase.  Again, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

4.  DB&amp;HVWs did an article on the install of the Jacob's set-up in a bug, but it was all fluff, no substance.  Jacobs also advertises in DB&amp;HVWs--coincidence???

5.  One of the reasons that I was interested in a system that replaced the stock coil (or Bosch BlueCoil in my case) was that my points were repeatedly pitting after less than 500 miles.  I had replaced the points, condensor, cap, rotor, plug, &amp; wires numerous times to no avail.  After I purchased the unit, the tech person informed me that the current across the points was not reduced from the current across the points w/ a stock coil.  This seems to me a significant disadvantage since other units (i.e., the Universal CDI) do reduce current across the points and thereby significantly reduce point wear.  Since I don't have many miles on the unit and since I installed a Pertronix pointless ignition, I can't comment on how point-wear was affected by the system.  My situation is also complicated by the fact that I installed some in-line resistor's in the power supply to the Jacobs unit.  Again, I don't have any data on whether this worked (and I can't recall the specs on the resistors).

6.  FWIW, I recall that after I installed the Jacobs system on my 1600 SP, I noticed that the engine felt stronger.  The motor died soon after for unrelated reasons, and I don't have any data like comparative fuel mileage--just a subjective feeling of more power.  I did transplant the system to my new 1600 DP, but do not have many miles on it, so again, no data.

In retrospect, I feel that the Jacobs set-up, while apparently well made, is simply more than a stock motor needs.  I would look instead to the Universal CDI set-up discussed by Hoover about which you will find much in the archives (possibly combined w/ a Pertronix pointless ignition set-up about which you will also find much in the archives including some recent posts that suggest getting one or the other, but not both).  I recommend getting the Hoover CD from BusDepot and reading what Hoover has to say on the subject of CDI systems.  The Universal CDI recommended by Hoover appears to be cheaper and perfectly adequate for the stock application.

IMHO, you could do worse than the Jacobs set-up, but you could also do better.

Good luck,
