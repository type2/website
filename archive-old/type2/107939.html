Subject: While on the subject of Distributors and Advance (First Post)

    Well this is my first post to this list. I just joined the list having
just gotten my 72 westy back after 6 years of sitting un-loved on the
oppisite coast of the country. It cost close to $1500 to get it shipped back
but now that I have her back I'm glad I did it (Thanks to my wife for not
letting me send her to the junkyard)!

    Anyway, having seen the post today about distributors and advance, I
figured I would chime in on a similar subject. My '72 (Stock 1700) with a
single weber progressive on it currently has the 009 mechanical advance
distributor. My guess is that the VW engineers probably knew better than me
when they specified the specific advance curve on the stock vaccum advance
distributor. I mean not every vw air cooled in every application is going to
require the same advance curve for optimum performance/drivability. That
said.....  I am looking for a stock  72 distributor (vaccum advance ) in
good shape (Contact me off list if you have one). As well as any advice on
where (on the carb) the vaccum should come from. I dont need to know the
exact location; The theoretical location would be fine; Manifold
Vaccum(below the butterfly) or Venturi Vaccum (Above the butterfly)

P.S&gt; If there is any faux pas for the group in the message, let me know.
Thanks-Techrat
