Hi all,

I've been following the list for some time now but I'm yet to see this
question asked!  Does anyone know where I can get two STABILIZER LINKS (and
bushings) that attach to the stabilizer bar on the front suspension of a
1981 Vanagon?   I have two vanagons and neither one has any stabilizer
links.  Maybe these newfie roads are TOO rough.  If anyone could help me
out I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Keith
'80 and '81 Vanagon
Newfoundland
