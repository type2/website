Subject: Not Quite Idling - Revisited

OK, So I thought I had my stalling problem solved after fixing my vacuum
line problem.....guess not!

My bus stalled on me yesterday while sitting at a light. It fired back up
right away. I kept the RPMs higher than normal idle to keep it going.
I drove it to work this morning and the same thing happened, while sitting
at a light again. I once again got it going and kept the RPMs up there to
get to work - However...as I was driving along, I had a very sudden,
momentary, power loss while accelerating. It was kind of like I drove into
something, almost whiplash! It went away within 2 seconds, and I continued
to work. What the heck was that??

Nine hours later.....
I get off from work and it wouldnt start. Finally, after checking all the
vacuum lines (and a few expletives) it started, and I babied it home. I
didnt really do anything to it, it just decided to start.
Im wondering what to check now.

Any thoughts out there?  77 2.0L FI
Thanks again!
