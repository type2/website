check your cooling system, especially the seals and tin.  

cooling system.

air pump (Fan)
intake air ducts
output heat ducts or bypass ducts on rear of vehicle

all air &quot;SHOULD&quot; come in the vents, go thru the fan and over the engine,
then out the lower side of engine...any variation means reduced cooling
ability of engine
