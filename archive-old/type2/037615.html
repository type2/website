Subject: Re: 72 Westy Seat ?s

Hi Meredith,

I just recently replace my westy gold vinyl with a bandana pattern navy
material.  The fabric is attached as the original was, with snaps around the
rear facing seat.  You can see the snaps at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/haverbug/Rearseat.jpg.  I am sewing the curtains
right now.  It's amazing what this kooky math teacher/ coach will do for his
VWs ;0)

&gt; I think this applies to all early z beds so, can someone tell me the
&gt; purpose of the spring loaded metal swing arms on the z bed. What was
&gt; their purpose and how are they suppose to work. If you manually adjust
&gt; them you can get them to rest in the studs that come out and seam to be
&gt; for this swing arm. However if you do this the back of the bed is
&gt; upright facing the rear of the bus, any clues?
&gt;
&gt; Also how was the fabric attached to the back part of the jump seat. The
&gt; original westy stuff was gone and P.O. left me wondering how is was
&gt; originally. I still had a few snap buttons so I think this must be the
&gt; way it was attached, is this so, only with snaps?
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if the scrap piece of original westy curtain material
&gt; that I removed from the closet door window covering would be of interest
&gt; to any one. Is is not usable for any thing but a pattern, the color is
&gt; still good around the edges so that would help. If not it will go in the
&gt; trash, if you do want it it might be a while before I can get it out,
&gt; HOSS is taking all of my free time now.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Meredith
