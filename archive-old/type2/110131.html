Subject: Whistle While You Work

Hiya All,

The Duck is a 1970 7 pasenger walk through - pretty much stock all the way 
through.
When cruising around at highway speed (55 to 60) I'm hearing a whiney high 
pitched whistle coming from the engine bay.  Now this noise is not annoying (at 
least to me anyway) and I associate it with larger &quot;flat&quot; engine 
configurations, like the tank I crewed on.
I guess the question I'm asking is...........is this noise normal for a 1600 
equipped Bus or to be expected?  Or do I have some sort of air/vacuum leak I 
need to attend to?

Mike
