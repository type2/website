Subject: Weber 32/36 Carbs on '72

Hi All,
	I figured it was probably time I spill the can of beans on this
issue that has been killing me for 4 months. In April, I purchased a '72
Sunroof Deluxe bus that has a 1700 CC engine with a single Weber
progressive 32/36. Try as I may, I could not get the thing to run well,
despite a complete tune up, new dizzy (tried both vacuum and 009), new
everything. The fuel pump was a Facet electric, the one that it seems
everybody uses. It appeared to be working fine. I re-built the carb, and
when it still ran the same I took it to my local VW guru (in business for
over 25 years) who said the accelerator pump on the carb was bad (even
after I had just rebuilt the carb, which included replacing the
accelerator pump). They would not fix it because they only replace things,
not repair, which gets very expensive, and is foolish. After fooling with
the thing for another 2 months, I noticed a clanking noise on the #4
cylinder, which turned out to be a valve seat which was coming loose from
the head (the local VW guy didn't even find it!). So I got a new pair of
remanufactured heads and put on there, and the compression is right around
120 PSI all the way round (with engine warmed up). This didn't change
anything, so I finally purchased a NEW (completely) Weber 32/36 and put on
there, and the thing ran the same. I replaced the fuel pump, and went back
to a stock mechanical fuel pump (ordered from Rocky Mtn.). And the thing
still doesn't run correctly. Here's what happens:
I can crank it up, and it will start right away and idle just fine, but
when I try to drive it anywhere, the thing is just awfully jerky. The
transistion between idle and full throttle is not smooth. If I just rev it
up, then engine will bogg very significantly, I guess more like a chugg,
and then it will rev up. I have to rev to 20000 gazillion RPM's just to ge
the thing going at a stop sign. I have tried starting the idle mixture
adjustment screw at 2 1/4 turns out from all the way in, and I've gone in
both directions to no avail. My wonderful (yeah, right) mechanic took a
look at it, and bored out the primary idle jet, which originally had a 60
stamped on it, almost all the way he could. The hole was at least three
times in diameter than what it was originally (if this makes sense). The
thing ran a little better. So I completely re-wired the whole bus, all the
way to the dash, and then with no adjustments to the carb, the thing began
to run incredibly rich. You should have seen the primary ignition wire
under the dash, crusty, insulation mostly burned off, it's a wonder that
it ran... So I put back in a stock size 55 primary idle air correction jet
and the thing ran like it did before the re-wiring. It bogs heavily on
acceleration, has little power, and leaves you with then empty filling in
your stomach that maybe you aren't going to make it to your destination.

Thanks for getting this far. If you have any ideas what I need to re-jet
this carb to to make it run better, what I need to change, ANYTHING!,
please let me know. In the four months I've had this thing, I haven't
driven it 600 miles yet.


Thanks sincerely,
John Tracy
