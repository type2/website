Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel consumption/Leaks

Hi Sam,

18 mpg down to 16 mpg is only about 12% difference, so unless there are
other symptoms of a fuel leak you shouldn't yet rule out other possible
causes: bad spark plugs, clogged air filter, vacuum leak, brakes sticking or
just a thief with a siphon. Engine damage could also lead to poor gas
mileage, if it was still drivable it would be less efficient and lead to
poor economy.

I'm not denying that a log is a great diagnostic tool, I keep one myself.
But if you've lost more than a gallon of fuel to a leak you'd have left a
puddle somewhere and the smell would be everywhere, at least until that
gallon had evaporated.

Just don't rule out the other possibilities.

Happy trails,

&gt; I went &amp; filled up the 70 westy this morning and looked in my fuel/mileage

&gt; I have a palm pilot app that keeps track of my vehicles.
&gt; I now see that there must have been a leak for about 2000 miles as the fuel
&gt; consumption had increased guess that the metal fuel pipe was weeping and that
&gt; will give you bad gas mileage,
&gt; The moral is that if you keep a log you can see symptoms of a problem before
&gt; they cause a problem.
&gt; I should have looked for why my gas mileage had dropped from 18 to 16 mpg.
