Subject: Re: [T2] CB channels

May I also suggest Channel 2.  I meant to start this topic a couple days
ago, but forgot :-)

I'll be coming down from MA on Thursday and Friday and I'll put mine on
channel 2 to listen to the Type 2 folks :-)

That is, unless everyone else on the east coast is going to use something
else :-)

&gt; Anybody have a list of the CB channels that the various carabusses will be
using? I will be coming down from the Washington, DC area and will be trying
to play &quot;catch-up&quot; to the other southward bound voyagers. With as many
convoy's heading that way I would hope that I could catch one.
&gt;
&gt; Happy trails,
