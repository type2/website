Subject: noisy hydraulic lifter cure

Happy Friday all!  Well, I got the bus back from the shop yesterday, and
though it is not running perfectly, it is much better than before.  Vacuum
is up to an acceptable 16&quot;, CO levels are fine, HC's are a bit high.
The shop is still convinced there is a leak in the plenum, though it only
happens when it is installed (they removed it and smoke tested it, and
all was fine).  The owner even gave me plenum from his parts pile, though
I'll have to plug up the EGR port (thanks for the plenum offer, Karl).
We'll see...  Thanks for all the advice on this one.  I'm gonna try to
pressurize the system when I get a chance and see what I find.  Though
for now, I think I'm gonna just enjoy the bus for a while :^)

Anyway, one thing that the shop did while the bus was in: they poured a
treatment product in the oil called &quot;Militec-1&quot; to help the valve
clatter (due to the hydraulic lifters).  The shop owner sees tons of
Vanagons and the lifters consistently have trouble pumping up after
sitting around for a few days and leaking down.  He claims this product
is the one thing that really helps the problem.  And I'll be d*mned...
the bus is quiet as ever.  I even had trouble hearing the engine at
times, it was so whisper quiet.  Unbelievable!  That thing had been
clackety-clacking like you wouldn't believe (I have bench bled all the
lifters, some I've done several times), and now... !!!
Apparently, this product is not an oil treatment, but a metal treatment
and lubricant.  Found it on the web, for more info see:
http://www_dot_militec-1_dot_com.  Kinda pricey, but it lasts for 15k miles.
