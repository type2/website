Hey Out there -
I have a 71 westy, and have been told that I have European tail/brake 
lights, containing two bulbs (not one like the US version.) I have been 
having trouble re-wiring, and finally got them to work, but the brake lights 
work off of the turn signal light. This is OK, but Ideally I would like them 
to run off of the tail light dual filament bulb. Right now one of the two 
wires to the 2 filament bulb dead ends, the other goes to the side 
marker/tail light circuit.
So i guess i need to see the European wiring diagram to see what they did, 
or just accept what I have as good enough (If it ain't broke don't fix it?)
I do already have both b/w and color wiring diagrams from Bently and Thom 
Fitzpatrick's site...Thanks - need the Eurpoean one.
Any suggestions?
wink
