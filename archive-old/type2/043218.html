Hi All

I have a 2nd battery set up in my 71 Westy. I just had
my mechanic wire it up - I still need to go buy and install
a battery.

A question though...shouldn't there be a junction or fuse block
coming off the 2nd battery to make connections? I want to run my
radio and 12v coffee maker. If anybody &quot;in the know&quot; would ping
me wiring instructions it would be appreciated.

Can you tell I'm electrically challenged?

Thanks,

Pete
