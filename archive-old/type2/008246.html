I may too face this question one day so I always pay attention to these
threads. I have also done a bit of reading on this rebuild. 

Ask youself this question: am I happy with what I have? If the answer is yes
then just do the heads. Joining the 2.0L club will require at the least new
crank, rods, jugs, pistions, heads, and all the little things that go with
them. This means splitting the case which brings up the &quot;as long as I am in
there list.&quot; 

How many miles on your 1.7? Conventional wisdom has it that a pancake will
go as far as 200,000 miles before a bottum end rebuild if it was well
treated and maintained.

Oh yeah, how deep are your pockets? Heads are expensive but cheaper than a
rebuild that you may not need :)&gt;
