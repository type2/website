Subject: Re: [T2] diesel conversion (some questions)

Search google for auto theft interdiction which is catching on state to
state.

You may be preventing a future owner from ever registering that VW.

&gt; If you've done the VIN switcheroo, the MV dept. computer will show the old
&gt; bus, not the diesel. Maybe OK in NC, but what about other states? And if
&gt; you try to sell it, and the next owner gets caught, could/would HE bail out
&gt; of it and accuse you of fraud? I tend to think this could get really sticky.
&gt; These regs about changing VINS are to prevent stolen cars from reenter-
&gt; ing the market...The penalties would be the same for a $100 bus as for a
&gt; Lambo...
