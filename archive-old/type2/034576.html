Subject: Ign switch: removal of wires from electrical portion

On 71 SC: 5 wires to be removed from back of switch, so switch can be
replaced, are extremely tight. Broke one off attempting to remove. The
spades on the ends of the wires..5 different sizes, I think, have an unusual
(to me anyway) little protuberance..that may be there for a grasp point to
pull on. Understand these leads are just a straightforward pull out. Aside
from more cans of JB blaster to loosen them up...any other tricks to coaxing
them out? Please p-mail, as we're on digest.

Thanks, Marv Krupp..not quite so willing to part out the SC now...
