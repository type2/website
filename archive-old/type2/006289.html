&gt;I've noted that the AMC heads seem to maintain this raised cylinder head
&gt;mating area, and the Heads Marked with the VW OEM casting mark seem to
&gt;become more recessed over a period of use.
&gt;
&gt;Do you suppose that this condition on the VW OEM head was caused by the
&gt;heads being over torqued or over heated?

My guess is that thousands of heat cycles cause the OEM heads to &quot;shuffle&quot;.
Normally, this recess is removed by flycutting to restore the sealing surface.
Otherwise, you risk the damage of leaking compression, wherein the burning fuel
will actually cut a groove (and leak).
As for the AMC head, there will be a difference in chamber shape and volume
making them incompatible with OEM head on the same engine.
The OEM Beetle dual-port heads have the ledge. It lowers compression, and is
compensated for by a smaller combustion chamber bowl area. The ledge opens
up the quench area, and is essentially designed to deter detonation insofar as it
encourages turbulence and is also responsible for lowering emissions. The ledge
may not be flycut because it will raise the CR too high for pump gas .
