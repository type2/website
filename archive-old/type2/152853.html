hey Tony  I second that  I took a broken 30 year old fly rod in to see if it 
could be fixed and they handed me a brand new one .  I have a set of their 
duck boots that I have sent back for resoling about 8 times. bought these there 
in 1974. They have patches over patches they keep telling me that they can't do 
them again but I figure that each time it would be a different person doing 
them so what the heck.  I carry these in my 59 panel with safria windows so 
that when it rains I can keep my feet dry  LOL  later  mark Dearing
