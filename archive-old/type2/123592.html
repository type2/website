Subject: the volkswagen vibrator

who needs a vw vibrator. i pulled one off behind a 77 gas gauge at a yonke
yard. that is the correct terminology, a vibrator? here i am thinking i
thought i've seen everything, then i pull a dash pod to remove dash stuff,
and then down the way i remove another pod, same vintage, and there's that
part again - what is it. i grabbed one, threw it into my tool bucket, and
found  it in the books to be called none other than a - -vibrator? do i
have a vibrator on my 75? i never looked ?~0

i found a great place to hang my reserve windshield: i forgot i had a 75
mint front nose, cut off at a junk yard that last year, and there it is
looking into the bay window of my livingroom. the answer staring me in the
face. a bay looking at a bay - fancy that. well the windshield was missing
outta that nose and i realized i could use the duct tape (hadn't used it in
a few weeks since mexico) sticky side out making an &quot;x&quot; on the glass and
around the inside.  whah-lah. i am the master of my junk again. thanks all
who replied - all good things in all good time.  - steve
