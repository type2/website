&gt;Ok I replaced my heater boxes with J-Tubes, runs a lot quiter but one side
has a &gt;small exhaust leak, is there a special clamp I can use where it meets
the muffler? &gt;If so please let me know where I can find it. Thanks. Also am
I harming the heads by 

I'd recommend welding on 2 bolt flanges to the muffler/tubes.  More work,
but worth it.  A Bugpack distributor can sell you a flange kit.   My local
exhaust shops couldn't provide me with a two bolt flange with a small enough
ID for my heat exchanger tube and I didn't want to build up weld to make a
larger one fit.  The Bugpack kit I used worked fine.  Berg sells a kit as
well.   Since the J-tubes are larger diameter you might not run into this
problem.

&gt;not having heater boxes under them that the tin surrounds so that the air
can blow &gt;through? Seems to me that more air can get to them with the
j-tubes in.

You can use the tin that came stock on some Type 181's (that had the gas
heater and J-tubes stock).  This tin extends over to the J tubes to close
the gap.  The lower cooling tinware acts as a plenum to direct the hot
engine air flow rearward (which it can't do as affectively with the large
gap on the sides), as well as protects the pushrod tubes.  Also, proper
thermostat operation might be affected by leaving the larger gap.  Give Berg
a call, I think these are listed in the rear of their catalog under VW
Brazil parts for ~$12 each.
