&gt;I'm glad that you saw an improvement.  The question is, what caused the
&gt;improvement?  Few people do this sort of conversion start with a fresh,
&gt;well-adjusted stock ignition.  I'd venture that a fresh plugs would result
&gt;in pretty much the gains you cite over worn plugs.

George, based on what I've seen at the dyno, I would respectfully disagree with you.  I have run old, worn plugs and seen no increase in hp on the dyno by changing to new ones.  I'll admit that I had changed some other things at the same time, but I think it is highly unlikely that the other changes negated any increased hp from the new plugs.

&gt;Also, was it the Pertronics, the CDI, or the plugs that resulted in the
&gt;gains cited?  It's hard to figure out what is going on when you change
&gt;more than one thing at a time.

My guess is that the CDI produced the increase in torque and hp.  I had a friend dyno his Mustang before and after a CDI system and he picked up 3-4hp also.  No, it's not a bus but is a related piece of hard evidence.

&gt;&gt; Was it worth it? To me, hell yes. No tune ups. Change the 
&gt;&gt; plugs every 60k miles or so. Never check the advance again. No hassle starts 
&gt;&gt; at -10f. More Torque, no points bounce, mis-fires or weirdness associated 
&gt;&gt; with a Kettering Ignition System.
&gt;
&gt;I must be charmed.  I've never experienced those symptoms with points.

My plugs do not wear quickly with points.  In fact, I would expect them to wear faster with a CDI system since there is more energy going through the plug.  I have however had minor issues with points - mainly slowly changing dwell which must be adjusted out periodically.

&gt;The electronic systems are clearly superior in performance, but the points
&gt;aren't as bad as many make them out to be.  The big advantage, IMO, is
&gt;that they can be easily fixed if they go south, an important consideration
&gt;if you venture to places where AAA won't go.

It is my understanding that the electronic systems can be removed easily if they fail.  Right?

&gt;&gt; Will the 200.00 price tag buy you a butt 
&gt;&gt; load of points and condensors? Yup. Is it worth it to almost NEVER have to 
&gt;&gt; jack with my Ignition System?  To me, with a business, wife, two kids under 
&gt;&gt; four, and a Westy that is my Daily Driver, all I can say is , Hell Yes.( And 
&gt;&gt; thank GOD for Hydro. Lifters!!!)

I second the praise of hydraulic lifters.  I've had 85,000 trouble-free miles with them now.

&gt;I suppose that it's a matter of philosophy.  I'm glad that we're both
&gt;happy with ours.

Agreed!
