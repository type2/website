Dear Joe.

The modification to the ventilation booster fans is as follows:-

(1)  Obtain one or two (dependent upon how many dashboard, blue ventilation 
control levers there are) white nylon spacers, with riveted brass 6.3mm 
spade terminal. These are normally found (one per vehicle) on the pivot stud 
of the dashboard, red heater control levers, of 1972-79 VW 17/18/2000 Type 
2s.

(2)  Position the white nylon spacer(s) in place of the standard black nylon 
spacer(s), on the pivot stud, of the blue ventilation control lever(s), so 
that the metal lever makes contact with the brass rivet, when the blue 
ventilation levers are pulled dawnward.

(3)  Instead of connecting the brown earth (i.e. ground) wires from the fan 
motors to the vehicle bodywork, connect them instead, to the riveted brass 
6.3mm spade terminal(s), of the white nylon spacer(s).

The metal housing and plastic blades, of your particular ventilation fans, 
do not affect the mofification procedure!

I have need of at least one and preferably two, white nylon spacers, so that 
I can complete the upgrade of the heating system of my British specification 
1973 VW '1600' Type 2, to VW 17/18/2000 Type 2 specification, with 
associated electric booster fan, when I transplant my 1911cc VW 17/1800 Type 
2 &amp; 4 hybrid engine.

If you come across more spacers than you need for your van, I would be 
pleased to acquire them from you. You might like to trade a copy of my 
illustrated, two page article about the pantograph rear-window wiper, for 
the 1968-79 VW type 2, which was published in the December 1996 issue, of VW 
Motoring magazine!?! The installation is very neat and tidy, having 
virtually the appearance of a factory fitted option and sweeps more than 
half of the total window area.

Regards.

Your last message was :-

&gt;Nigel - mine are metal housing, plastic blade, if that makes any diff.
&gt;
&gt;I'd love to know more about how you wired them to the blue controls.  If
&gt;memory serves, that resembles the way they were wired in later busses,
&gt;ie, on when the vents are open.  What did you do, position a momentary
&gt;push-off switch so when the levers are at &quot;close&quot;, the switch button is
&gt;pushed, opening the contacts?  Sorta like a door switch?
