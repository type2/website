Subject: Re: [T2] Do I have to pull the engine?

You can do it but I think you'll have to remove the fan shroud.

Can be done but I think it is easier to remove the engine and remove the 
fan shroud. I done it both ways.

Don't leave it out.

Why not make the mechanic do it. He has the tools and the lift...


&gt;THE PROBLEM:  On my 1976 Westy, when the mechanic returned my rebuilt 
&gt;type4 back into the engine compartment, he left out a piece of engine tin 
&gt;(021-119-358U Warm Air Duct, Rear Right)   After the bus escaped from his 
&gt;garage, I found the tin in a box inside the bus, and identified it using a 
&gt;diagram at Bus Boys. I want to put this piece of tin where it goes myself, 
&gt;if possible, without taking the bus back to the mechanic. Personal reasons.
&gt;
&gt;THE QUESTION:  I'm asking the group if they think I can fit in this piece 
&gt;of tin without dropping the engine.    Should I even TRY to do it with the 
&gt;engine in place?
&gt;
&gt;I know that I can drop the engine and take off the fan housing and 
&gt;alternator cover plate and air flap assembly and probably the cylinder 
&gt;cover plate, and probably the intake manifold tubes on the curb side 
&gt;cylinders, and probably the injectors, and then fit the warm air duct in 
&gt;behind the alternator, and then replace all the aforementioned parts. If I 
&gt;drop the engine I also have to disconnect the exhaust system and the fuel 
&gt;supply and the electricals and then the mechanicals, and this seems like a 
&gt;pretty advanced problem for a first-timer. If I have to do all that in the 
&gt;back yard, I think I'll take it back to the mechanic.
