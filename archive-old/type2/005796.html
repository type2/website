Subject: [T2] Warped Head, Do I have one

&gt;So I bought my self a leak tester and found that I have a leak between the
&gt;Head and the top of the Piston.
&gt; What do I need to do to make my head seal back around my piston?

( This is a technical marble B^)
The repair is a trip to the machine shop where  Both heads will be &quot;decked&quot; .
The compression surface is checked and cut to match the index of
the valve cover surface . A corresponding cut must also be made on the
bottom surface of the head for sealing to occur at the compression surface.
Be sure to take the cylinders with you for the machinist to reference.
Insofar as this will change the compression ratio, the cut should be kept
minimal, unless you desire to go for more power. Do the math. cc the heads.
It is also noted that the valve train geometry will be affected, as the heads
are closer to the centerline, the push rod and rocker angles will be affected.
The machinist will be able to tell you how deep the cuts will have to be
before the cuts are made, it's your job to decide to do it. I say go for it.
Dave
