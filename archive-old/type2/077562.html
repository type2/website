Subject: Re: Rear Hatch Hinge Covers

The ones at Wolfsburg West, Bus Depot and RMMW are pre 68 but it appears
that WCM has the later ones. Thanks for the tip.


&gt; Hiya Robert,
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that I have run into these hinge covers in a number
&gt; of places.  One 
&gt; aftermarket source that comes to mind is West Coast Metric 
&gt; (211 530A L/R).  
&gt; Kinda spendy at $66.00 for the pair.  You might find them 
&gt; cheaper from Ron 
&gt; over at the Bus Depot, he handles WCM parts.  And I know that 
&gt; I've seen them 
&gt; in other catalogs.  You might also try Wolfsburg West or BFY.
&gt;
