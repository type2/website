sounds like a deal!

&gt; I had the same thought.  When I purchased some tires a
&gt; while ago, though, the guy I dealt with talked me out
&gt; of some more expensive tires for my old Jetta, and got
&gt; me to buy some &quot;more driveable&quot; tires.  What I wanted
&gt; to purchase were more for the road rallying type, not
&gt; the daily driver type.  

This is where experience is valuable in a tire supplier.  There are some
DOT-legal tires out there that will give wonderful traction and
performance for 5000 miles because that is what they are designed to do.
Sometimes they are identified as &quot;race compound&quot;, sometimes not.

&gt; &gt; I'd go with the local dealer.  Keep the pump primed,
&gt; &gt; as it were.  If
&gt; &gt; there's a problem, then there's only one way to
&gt; &gt; point the finger as well!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I'm leaning towards the local place.  Free
&gt; rotation every 5k, free balancing with each rotation,
&gt; plus a few other little things.  Since this will be a
&gt; daily driver, I would feel more comfortable getting
&gt; the road hazard.  It's cheap insurance.  Kinda like
&gt; the AAA vs. no AAA.  I'd rather fault on the side of
&gt; caution with 2 little kids and a wife.

The rule of thumb is that you only insure against hazards that you will
not be able to pay for immediately.  Since the road hazard warranty won't
do anything that a credit card (or cash) won't do it isn't all that
much of a bargain.  

The other problem with the road hazard warranty is that it locks
you into a single store or chain.  If you blow a tire on the road
somewhere (it never seems to happen close to home) the local tire emporium
won't honor your warranty anyway.

I use the method I learned in rural Nevada.  Carry two spares!  Your
chances of finding the correct tire on the road is pretty slim, warranty
or not.  So far this method has worked perfectly as neither spare has
touched the ground yet!  :)

AAA is kind of a special case.  What you're really paying for is the
ability to call an 800 number and have some nice person figure out which
towing company to call for you.  They have nice maps too.  Pity they don't
really represent the interests of motorists in the political arena like
they did originally.

&gt; I carry spare
&gt; stuff to fix if I can.  But, as with any vehicle
&gt; that's 30+ years old, I want to CYA.  How many people
&gt; drive their 30 year old cars every day?  

Well, I do, and you do, and my wife does...

That spare stuff is an excellent idea.  Read my upcoming trip report!
