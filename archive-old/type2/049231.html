Subject: [T2] Bolt size question

Hello listees,

I'm trying to find out what size the front bumper attachment bolts are for
my 71 Campmobile. I have the correct center bolts, but what size are the 4
bolts (2 on each side) on the outer curved ends of the bumper? They appear
to be an odd size. Also, I believe I should mount the bumper using curved
lockwashers - is this correct? TIA

Thomas
