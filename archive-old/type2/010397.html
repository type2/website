&gt; 1.  What size engine originally came in the 71 Type 2?  From what I
&gt; can tell, 
&gt; I guess it was a 1500 or 1600cc.  Does anyone know what it's
&gt; horsepower 
&gt; rating is?  Max speed, etc.

The engine is a 1600 dual port, the last refinement of the venerable
type 1 engine.  It's a good engine, puts out 50 horsepower or so, and
will push the bus along at a comfortable 60 mph.  I've had my '71 up to
75, but it is much more happy and comfortable to drive at 60 or 62. 
(these are true MPH figures, BTW.)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  If I wanted a more powerful engine, what would be the most
&gt; logical 
&gt; choice?  Would all the bus parts still interchange with it?  (I know,
&gt; I 
&gt; know...it's a bus, not a race car...but I'd still like it to have
&gt; some punch 
&gt; to it.  Nothin wrong with that, is there?)

No, but if you go for an engine swap be aware that you will increase
the complexity of the installation by several times.  You can easily
get an adapter to bolt just about anything to the VW transmission, but
then you have to mess with cooling, electrical, fuel, gearing, other
linkages, etc.  Once you get another engine in that engine bay, don't
expect any mechanic to want to touch it.  You'll be on your own!  If
you want more power you might be better off to get a later-model bus
with a type IV engine as standard.  They are more powerful than the
type 1 and will last a long time.

If you decide to go this route, let me know!  I'd _love_ to find a
rust-free '71!  :)

&gt; 3.  The bus is missing just about every piece of interior trim... 
&gt; It's naked 
&gt; inside.  Can anyone give me a brief description of what's supposed to
&gt; be 
&gt; there?  Where can I get this stuff?  I guess a junkyard would be my
&gt; best bet. 
&gt;  Just wondering if anyone knew of anyplace that specialized in
&gt; interior 
&gt; pieces for the bus.  There must be SOMEONE.

There are several outfits that do this.  I scrounged the wrecking yards
because I wanted original stuff, but you can get just about any sort of
interior from stock-appearing to pink-and-purple tuck'n'roll!

&gt; 4.  My wife has no clue how to drive a manual.  Of course, she'll
&gt; learn.  I 
&gt; heard a rumor someplace that doesn't SEEM very likely to me, so maybe
&gt; this 
&gt; would be the best place to ask it.  A very unreliable source told me
&gt; that VW 
&gt; had also made automatic transaxles?

Again, on later-model buses.  The '71 only came with a 4-speed.

&gt; That seems to be everything I can think of at the moment.  Once
&gt; again, I'd 
&gt; appreciate it if you replied directly to me.  I'd hate to get the
&gt; reputation 
&gt; of &quot;The guy that started that really long thread with the most
&gt; idiotic of 
&gt; questions.&quot;  

There are no idiotic questions.  There are idiots asking questions, but
you are far from that category.  Feel free to ask away!
