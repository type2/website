&gt; BUT...
&gt; 
&gt; A colleague has told me of a tool consisting of two halves which are fitted
&gt; to front and back of the metal via a pilot hole, and then a blade of some
&gt; kind which is turned by an allen key to cut the hole.  It's intended for
&gt; just such a job as this.   
&gt; Anyone know what thy're called, or where to find one ???

I've got em and they are great but danged if I can remember what it is
called, a &quot;hole press&quot; or something like that, BUT the place to get em is
at an Electrical contractors wholesale shop.  also they are not cheap, I
needed mine for work but they were about $20-25 EACH!  but they last
forever, I know I've had mine for 15+ years and they work like new

I have my guages on top of the dash in one of those bubble thingies that
all the guage folks sell.  I ran the wires through a speaker hole and it
just sits there and is held in place by the wires, hasn't moved in years
and is easy to look at (and if your into it) it does not damage the
dashboard itself

&gt; Also, I'm thinking of buying a Stainless Exhaust from Volksbits (in the UK)
&gt; any one know if they're any good ?
