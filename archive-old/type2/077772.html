Mark, Bob,

This is the second time this week that that statement has been posted and
for the second time this week, I have serious heartburn over it.  I
disagree.  Respectfully, but strongly.

TIMING IS BASED ON DISTRIBUTOR!!!!!!

The distributor controls all aspects of timing.  Where it starts, how fast
it advances, how far it advances.  The only sense in which engine makes
any difference in timing is maximum acceptable advance.  On a type1 block,
that is 27 degrees before top dead center (BTDC) at 3500RPM; on a type4
block, it is 32 degrees BTDC at 3500RPM.

If you will point a browser at Jim Thompson's page of distributors
( http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/ignition.htm ) you will find that the range
of timing specifications runs from 10 degrees BTDC to 10 degrees after top
dead center (ATDC). A quick survey of proper timing points indicates stops
at 10, 7.5, and 5 degrees BTDC; TDC; and 5 and 10 degrees ATDC.  6
different set points for distributors that go on one of two slightly
different engine designs!

Let us say, for example, that you own a 1976 bus with an automatic
transmission, equipped with the original VW 021-905-205P distributor and
properly timed to 7.5 degrees BTDC. Let us further say that you live in
the middle Atlantic states and are determined to visit Memphis, TN.
Before you leave, you give it a tune up and note that the dwell is
hunting.  You pull the distributor and the shaft is wobbly... the bearings
are shot.  So you reach into your parts box and pull out a VW
021-905-205AC (proper timing spec: 5 ATDC), also from a 1976 automatic
transmission bus.  Install it, set dwell, then set the timing to 7.5 BTDC
*as you always have*.  Then you head off for Memphis.  If you are very
lucky, your severely oveheated engine would die on you around Salem, VA,
so that you could have it towed to Mark Deering's shop to have the engine
rebuilt.

What changed in the above example?  the engine?  or the distributor?  Why
did the engine overheat?  Because the timing spec *for the distributor*
changed from 7.5 BTDC for the -205P distributor to 5 ATDC for the -205AC
and by ignoring that change, you have set the timing at 3500 RPMs to be
12.5 degrees too far advanced!
