Subject: [T2] Steve G., Archives, et al

Just a couple observations. Sometimes we fight battles that
don't need to be fought. (At least not in public). This
administrative stuff should have been worked out between
admins (including Steve) with a few _private_ emails or, if
necessary, telephone calls.

While not a particularly active member of this list, I have
owned and worked on VW's for many years, subscribed for some
time, and contributed when I could.

I have known Steve G. for a number of years and he is a
totally stand up guy, with tremendous integrity. His
excitement with and commitment to VW's is infectious and it
has been a pleasure to share my shop with him on a number of
occasions. I know that the last thing he would ever do would
be to hurt either the list or its participants in any way.
Evidence is that he did maintain our archives for a number
of years at his own expense, a tremendous commitment of time
and energy. Let's thank him for that.

I do agree with Adrian Pillow, however that  &quot;As soon as a
CD is burned it is old information.&quot;  Let's stay with a
searchable knowledge base because we need it. Regardless of
who &quot;owns&quot; the material, the alternatives to _not_ having it
are grim.

Time is short....let's go play Volkswagen......


Best To All,
