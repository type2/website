Toronto,Canada eh!

Yeah, I'm 48 and beginning to feel like my bus looks.  Not that bad, no
serious rust, just little bitty things everywhere that tell the world and
the owner that it's been some time since this model was brandy new.  Hoping
there'll be some of those rescuers when *I'm* sittin' in the corn field
with wrens in my headlights and raccoons in my upholstery.

'Sniff sniff....DRIVE WITHOUT MERCY!
