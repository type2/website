Bob's  accessys_at_smart_dot_net  Karma was definitely raised yesterday as I
received the very much needed pushrod tube retainer he gratiously sent.
Unfortunitely, as I have very recently re-entered the realm of air cooled
VW's, I have nothing at this time to offer to the members of this list.
Thanks Bob.
