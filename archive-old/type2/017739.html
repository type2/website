        Any sources for lap belts for the middle seat in my 7
passenger?  The mounting bolts are located on the floorboard directly
behind the seat so I assume the straps have to be relatively long.  


I am also looking for these belts.  The long ones for the middle seat,
that attach by bolts to the floor.  I'd like to be able to transport
more than the six people I can now;  our center seat is the fold-down
3-seater and we only have 1 seatbelt for it.
