&lt;&lt; The sliding door locks in the open position:
Question:
1. Will the sliding door be ok locked in the open position while driving 
around?
No damage to anything?
 &gt;&gt;

Don't do that! there's only a teeny tiny bit of sheet metal holding that
door in an open locked position...One bump and the door will probably
slide forward and then expensively off...Besides, it's probably illegal,
even on Halloween... ;-(
