Subject: How to identify my engine size?

Hey, 

I was just wondering if there was any difinitive way to identify the size of my engine, other than the letters etched on the fan housing.  According to those letters, mine is a 2000, which seems normal enough, being that it's a '78, but I had to get the engine rebuilt a while back, and I seem to remember the mechanic saying that he was putting in a 1600.  What part of the engine, exactly, changes the size of it?

The exact numbers are GE033750, and here's where I found the engine codes:

Also, if it turns out the engine is a 1600, does anyone know if I would then be able to transfer it to an earlier body, like 69-72? (my '78 body is no bueno)  Thanks alot.

-Rob Meyer
