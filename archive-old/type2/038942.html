Subject: Re: Going Cross Country!!!

I used to take motorcycle trips every Spring.
I once wrote a magazine article titled &quot;Cure for the Blue Funk&quot;
which talked about what to take on a trip.
It applies to anyone camping, no matter what their vehicle
of choice is. Here's what I said:

First, take all the stuff you think you need, and spread it out on the garage floor.
Then separate it into &quot;essentials&quot;, and &quot;nice to have's&quot;
Then throw away 95% of the stuff, and take twice the money.

It works for me  :-]

&gt; &gt;Hello all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;im bran new to the list!  My girlfriend and I have been planning a cross
&gt; &gt;country trip for a couple of months now and are planning to leave in
&gt; &gt;June.  We will be doing alot of camping and backpacking so we wanted to
&gt; &gt;get some insight or suggestions as to the essential things we would need
&gt; &gt;to take with us.  Not only for the bus but for ourselves as well.  We
&gt; &gt;plan to travel for awhile and have become overwhelmed with the things we
&gt; &gt;are taking with us.  We also have our two dogs, so suggestions for them
&gt; &gt;would also be appreciated.  Again any advice from anyone who has done
&gt; &gt;this or traveled for awhile would be fantastic! Thanks for the help and
&gt; &gt;the insight
&gt;
&gt;      Less is more. I tend to packrat stuff on trips, and it makes things
&gt; harder. Took me about 20 minutes to setup and break camp on the Inuvik
&gt; run(everyone else took about 5). Halfway through that trip I was wishing
&gt; I'd packed a bit lighter... Bring only that which you  are sure you'll
&gt; need. If you think you *might* need it, leave it at home. Engine parts
&gt; excepted, of course...
&gt;
&gt; Peace,
