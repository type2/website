I've just discovered there was a P31 camper model in addition to the P21,
P22 and P27 models. It seems P31 is based on the P27 but still no stove:

My camper is a P22 and it has a stove and I think I have to conclude that it
was put in by the previous owner. I've been wondering why one of my shelves
below the sink was cut and glued back together and I think it was for the
installation of the propane fuel line. Where does the stock line get routed?

Has anyone else seen a stove like this?
