Subject: 79 calif electronic ignition

does anyone have a picture of the 79 calif electronic ignition installed, 
with reference to location of mounting the module and routing the harness 
etc. 

I have a 79 I can take a picture of ... but it isn't accessible right now.. 
and a friend wants to install his 79 calif electronic ignition in his 75, so 
he wants an idea how , where it was done from v w 

Thanks!
