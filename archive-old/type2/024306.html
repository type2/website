&gt; Can he sue me?

He can take you to court for something like double the face value of the bounced check, plus some for damages if I remember correctly. (This was California law some years ago when an employer bounced a check on me.)

In any case, I wouldn't mess with non-payment. Much better to recruit knowlegable VW chum &amp; have a pow-wow with the owner. Don't lose your cool, just pester a lot and chances are you'll get satisfaction.
