Ah yes,  Chinese tools.  Bought a Chinese manufactured Harbor Freight
distributed 10&quot; gap bed lathe from them back when the only store was their
warehouse in Camarillo.  It is not as well finished as a Cincinatti or a Le
Blond, but it was $3k not $30k.  It will do everything that I ever need to do
(and everything that the Cinci would do!) and will probably outlast me and my
children.  Their Pittsburg Forge end wrenches are a steal!  For the occasional
tool user, the quality is more than satisfactory.  Half my tools are Snap-on,
the other half came from Harbor Freight.  The Harbor Freight stuff I'm not
afraid to leave in an unlocked bus. (mandatory type2 content)  The Snap-on
stuff I worry about when it's in a locked roll-away in a locked, alarmed shop.

BTW, I'm a millwright/electrician by trade and most of the millwrights where I
work use Harbor Freight tools.  If you lose one, you haven't lost much.  If
you lose a Snap-on 2-1/4&quot; end wrench, you've lost a days pay.
