Well, whenever I loose something I always retrace my steps. Perhaps
you left reverse under the kitchen counter? Assuming you don't just
find it laying around, it's time to look through the bus and you can
start by crawling under just in front of the rear wheels. Scoot under
looking up. Look at the front of the transaxle and there should be a
long bar that goes into it coming from the front. This bar is what
transfers the movement from your shifter to the back. 

I would start by looking at 2 things. Make sure the front of the
transaxle is connected to it's mount point. If the tranny moves off it
it will make shifting near impossible. I kinda suspect the problem is
the connection between the link and the transmission. There should be
a square cage like thing that is the connector. If it moves around and
doesn't keep a solid grip on either end of the rods it connects you
will not have proper shifting. There should be no slop between these
connections. Start here, then move up front. If you have a Bentley the
adjustment is covered there.
