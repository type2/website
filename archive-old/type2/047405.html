Actually if the 10mm threads are stripped you can repair them.  I just
completed the repair on a wasserboxer with a botched heli-coil job. 
Whatcha gotta do is use either a keensert or a timesert.  These are
thread repair inserts that are actually small cylinders that have four
small splines that drive into the o/s threads after installation.

For details see: &lt;http://www.timesert_dot_com&gt; and &lt; http://www.newmantools_dot_com/kee.htm&gt;

Now it's FIXED!! (one caveat though...  The 8mm Keensert uses a 12mm x
1.25 tap which is a 'bastard' size.  Order the tap when you pick up
the insert.  It ain't in a standard metric tap &amp; die set.)
