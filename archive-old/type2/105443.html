I believe that the wire you are referring to powers the backup lights. 
If it has 12 volts on it then this is almost certainly where it goes. 
Took me a long time to figure that one out myself. The bus did not have 
working backup lights when I got it, and it took some time studying the 
wiring diagram to figure out that the power for them came from the coil. 
Check your light assembly on the drivers side of the bus for a hot 
connection for the backup lights.

If these are the wires I am thinking of, they are not used on the bus. 
The wiring harness used by VW was also used on non VW 6 cyl engines. 
These two wires would have gone to the other two injectors. My bus runs 
fine with these two not connected to anything.

|The last 2 pics shows 2 plugs that I found dangling

The first I don't recognize, but may be the power connector to the 
blower motor mounted on the top of the engine compartment. The plug on 
mine does not look like that, but I did get a blower motor once that had 
a port that looked kind of like that. It is hard to remember though, as 
I changed the plug to replace mine with the one I got. The second is 
most certainly a diagnostic plug used by VW. Mine has a cap on it to 
cover the prongs inside.

Hope this helps and you get the bus running soon.
