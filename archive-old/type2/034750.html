Good Morning All!
I just recvd my first digest and look forward to being on this list.
My name is Mike Mueller, live in Walnut Creek, CA, am a long time Porsche
Geek, and just bought a '72 Westy.
Actually, I haven't even picked it up yet, lets just say I have made the
decision to buy this one.  The paint is original, Body has little dings but
no major dents at all.
It is almost perfect inside, everything is there and looks well maintained.
The canvas has a tear so that will need to be replaced later.
Seats need to be redone and new mats as well.
I looked under and around and found no rust.
The previous owner had pulled the motor because he had to helicoil a
sparkplug hole.
The motor never got worked on and so it sits.
I bought it because I can do the motor work and it was a really good deal!

Now we start the questions...
I have multiple 914 motors in the garage (both 1.7's and a 2.0)
I noticed the Bus motor is carbed and single port as well.
whereas the 914 motors have FI and dualports.
What does it take to transplant one of these into the Bus?
What about the clutch?

Smog in CA isn't an issue anymore so I can with whatever I like.
Also, it needs a new muffler.  I've always been happy with Bursch for the
914 and 912 motors, what's the best for a bus?

I plan to get it up and running as soon as possible and then work on one
thing at a time.
I want to do the brake system next

And last, I am also on the Rennlist (Porsche list) and it wouldn't be a far
stretch to find another Porschephile on this list- anyone out there I know?

Thanks for your answers, your links, and your thoughts-
