    Anybody have any good ideas for removing crusty old
paint off of rubber window mouldings and those little
plastic gizmo's around the door handles  ?
    Bought a new, '79 van, that has a fair paint job but a
lousy masking job !
    Was gonna be really careful with paint stripper but
thought I'd throw it out to the list. Don't know if paint
stripper will affect the plastic thingys.

    TIA
                           Peter
