Subject: Re: [T2] Bus died while driving and now doesn't start(Help
  me!!!! )

&gt;until I started to slow down to make a turn, my engine &quot;popped&quot; (it 
&gt;sounded like a backfire) and there was no response from the transmission.
&gt;I was in 4th at the time and the engine just revved after the pop as 
&gt;I still had my foot on the pedal.  At first I thought I just slipped 
&gt;out of gear until I downshifted to third and the engine would just rev.
&gt;I pulled to the side of the road and turned the engine off.
&gt;I waited about 5 min and then tried to start it but no luck. 

I saw a couple of responses dealing with why the engine won't start, but
none dealt with the initial problem of the engine revving but nothing
happening on the drive-end of things.  I'd say with a fair amount of
certainty that the &quot;pop&quot; you heard was a CV joint breaking.  The engine not
re-starting after you turned it off is a completely separate.
