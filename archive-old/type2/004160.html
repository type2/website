&gt;    This is on a T4, not the T1 on the earlier buses. On my '69, with
&gt;the removable rear member, you could slide the engine right in and out,
&gt;but on the T4's it is a major hassle for me to do it. Having the engine
&gt;and tranny together when you put it back is just much, much easier.


I agree with Harmon even in a Bus most times, but as the origional poster
was talking an air cooled Vanagon I believe, I'll finish this arguement,
I'll take ANYONE on 1 on 1, 1 person only me pulling and resinstalling the
engine/trans as a combo, them pulling only the engine in an air cooled
Vanagon, and I'll bet I beat them timewise, including separation on the
ground.  I could alone at one time pull said powertrain in under an hour, I
bet no-one could do the same engine only, and I know particularly I could
beat them on the reinstall unless they have incredible alignment luck.  On
the Vanagon this is a joke, I consider it SOP to do things together, makes
alignment of the engine and trans SO much easier it is incredible.  Plus all
you really add is the inboard CV bolts (trivial), the shift linkage (about a
minute), and the clutch slave which is usually the major PITA (why don't I
have a cable).  The unit comes out very nicely well balanced etc, and avoids
having to get the upper right engine/tranny bolt in the car, 1 bolt that
I've struggled like 15 minutes with alone in situ.

My opinions only but if you are pulling the powertrain in a Vanagon, pull
both, I would go so far as to pull the tranny out if I hadn't in fact, then
you don't need to worry about whatever jury rig is holding it up, and
alignment will be a breeze.  Plus you are only really 4 bolts away if you
don't count CV's (which admittedly I usually whiz in and out with air).

On a Bus I waver, I still like to do the unit but it is more complicated
sometimes depending on how bad it is to get the shift linkage apart and then
you still must fight getting the nosecone over the axle beam, the coil
spring rear suspension is undoubtedly about the only thing I find better on
a Vanagon than a loaf.
