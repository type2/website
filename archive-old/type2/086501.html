Subject: vangon seats

Hi folks
I got the 1980 vanagon seat, and it did slide right into the drivers side
seat track.
What everyone has said about these seats is true, they are much more
comfortable.
I highly recommend the upgrade. My drivers side seat was shot, i can't
believe i rode on it as long as i did.

As far as i can tell the bottom of the vanagon seats are made up of a foam
padding, no springs. The only disadvantage is that you sit a bit higher,
about
a inch. I'm 6'1&quot; and i still think the comfort outweighs this though.

As Karl pointed out if your bus has a bulkhead behind the passenger side
seat,
they wont fit.  Unless you weld in some tracks from a donor van.
My driver and passenger side seat tracks were the same, with no bulkhead
behind them.
