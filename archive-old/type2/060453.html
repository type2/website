Hey Y'all,
   As the sun rises and I leave work I am thinking about how good life 
is. I pulled the motor out of the Bug that I bought last month to put in 
the Bus and discovered that it was not a type I motor. It has a AS 
number and the type II mounts, but no hole for type III dipstick tube. 
The books and other info I has say that it is a Super Beetle case but it 
looks like a type II case to me. Well anyway it turned out to be just 
what I needed for the Bus. The motor that came with the Bus was a type I 
with the adapter, and I thought I was going to have to use that for the 
new one, lucky me. I also found a new muffler at a local shop that was 
pulled off a costomer car after he desided he didn't like the sound. I 
got it for $10, and it was only used for a few days.
  Now I am going home and working on my 70 Bus and pulling the motor out 
of the 74 for a listee to put in his Westy. Hopefully I will have the 70 
on the road today.
   Well have a great Friday in VW land.
