After hearing about catapulting pumpkins, George said:

&gt;Why are these great events all at the wrong side of
the 
country? :)

&gt;Oddly enough, my students and I are building a siege
engine this year
(specifically, a floating counterweight trebuchet),
though our efforts
won't be of the magnitude of these machines.  One 
requirement is that we
should be able to fit it into the bus so that we can
take it to bus events!

++++++++++++++++

There is a fellow in Rice Lake, WI who does something
similar at his farm, with free admission.  In addition
to his catapult, he was just in a local paper with his
latest machine, a cannon that fires pumpkins and is
operated with compressed air.  Noisier and more
exciting, he says.
I hope to get to check him out, but not sure if I will
be able to get time to drive up there, about an hour
or so north of me.
Still not on the West coast, but a little closer.
