&lt;&lt; I just purchased a 1978 VW Automatic Transporter. The thing is in pretty
 good shape with only 129,000 miles. I have a small tranny leak that I'll be
 having repaired here later this week.
 
 My question is regarding general maintainance. What the best type of oil to
 us in the 2000cc engine? What other things should be looked at on a regular
 basis? Any information would be helpful. Thanks!
 
 Oh, btw, my sunroof is leaking as well. Where's the best place to get a seal
 for that? And how tough is it to install? &gt;&gt;

spend a day searching the archives.  a wealth of info is in there.  besides 
its a good place to get started when first coming on here....( hey everyone 
told me the same thing when i first got on!!!)
