Subject: RE: [T2] Camshaft question

I see now that one is dished and one is flat.

I guess RMMW's description confused me. It says the flat gear camshaft is
for Buses 60-71 but wouldn't a 71 with a DP 1600 use the dished gear due to
the larger oil pump?

&gt;What is the difference between a camshafts. . .
