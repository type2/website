&gt;&gt; I'm looking for some new pistons and cylinders for my overhaul I'm
&gt;&gt; doing for my 77 westy. I was mining my way through eBay and keep
&gt;&gt; seeing these &quot;AA&quot; piston and cylinder sets that sell for about $169.
&gt;&gt; Anyone used them or know of their quality level?
&gt;
&gt; Low quality made by Cheng Shin in China..

The AA cylinders have recently gotten better, though how long it'll 
take for
the redesigned ones to get throughout the supply chain is anyone's 
guess.
You can read a bit about it at 
http://shoptalkforums_dot_com/viewtopic.php?t=102555
The biggest other issue I'm aware of with the AA sets is that they're 
shipped
with Grant rings, which (IMO) suck.

I did some searches on the AA p/c sets on Samba and Shoptalkforums_dot_com,
and while I didn't find anyone raving about them being *good*, I didn't 
find
anyone ranting about them being *bad* either.  Still, people must be 
buying
'em .. or else they wouldn't still be on teh market.
