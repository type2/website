Sue:

You're pretty much between a rock and a hard spot here unless  you can work
on the car yourself; you've left yourself at the mercy of others, which is
OK if they're honest, not OK if they're not.

In order for an engine to run it needs spark (at the right time), fuel (in
the correct amount) and compression.  What part of the equation is lacking
here?

You say it &quot;turned over fine&quot; but the shop says it &quot;won't turn all the way&quot;?
There's a conflict here.  Either the starter motor will spin the engine just
fine, and it won't start, or the starter motor won't turn the engine over.
Which is it?  If the starter motor won't turn the engine over, why not?  A
competent shop should be able to distinguish the difference between a
mechanical / electrical problem in the starting system and a purely
mechanical problem in the engine that prevents the engine from rotating
without tearing the motor down.  Ask them to clarify.

If the engine turns over OK then ask the shop what part of the above
equation (spark/fuel/compression) seems to be the problem.  Again, a good
shop should be able to roughly distinguish a problem in one or the other
area without tearing the engine apart.

You may need another shop, or you may need to understand (i.e., get a CLEAR
explanation from your shop) your problem better.

Let us know one way or the other.

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I've been pretty much a lurker so far because, well, I haven't actually
&gt; driven my Westy yet. Here's the scoop. It ran fine when I looked at it.
Then
&gt; I bought it, had it towed home (not because it couldn't be driven but
because
&gt; I was in NJ and it was in Philly and the city was about to tow it in their
&gt; effort to clean up for the Republican Convention later this month...
forgive
&gt; me I digress!). So it was towed here. I have a knack for buying VWs that
run
&gt; when I look at them and then stop running as soon as they arrive here!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I replaced the ignition switch (which was bad when I bought it),
and
&gt; then it wouldn't start. Turned over fine, just never caught. Then I went
on
&gt; vacation to the UK. When I came back there were stickers on it that it
would
&gt; be towed in 24 hours if not removed from the parking lot (condo). Not
being
&gt; able to start it, and new to all this, what did I do? I had it towed to
the
&gt; only local aircooled shop I knew of.
&gt;
&gt; They say the engine won't turn all the way and that I'm probably looking
at a
&gt; rebuild job. They seem like nice people, though I have no experience with
&gt; them, but I'm hesitant to go the rebuild route because of the $$$--they
&gt; haven't given me a price yet. They said they would pull the engine and try
&gt; and determine the source of the problem and then give me a better idea of
&gt; what I'm looking at. I'm going to talk to them tomorrow.
&gt;
&gt; So, what should I ask? Is it reasonable that the bus ran fine, was towed
&gt; here, I replaced the ignition switch, it wouldn't start, was towed there,
and
&gt; now needs a new engine?? I guess stranger things have happened when it
comes
&gt; to VWs :~)
&gt;
&gt; Any advice appreciated. I really don't know what to do from here. I've
&gt; started doing some work on my 65 Bug, but no engine work per se (well, I
did
&gt; pull the carb and replace it). Mostly brakes, fuel lines, etc.)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks all...and hello to the other women on the list especially, it's
nice
&gt; to know we're out there too.
