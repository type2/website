Subject: Re: [VB] FW: SC Hoops, Canvas, and Wood

&gt; What's a set of these worth nowadays?  I found a guy with a  
&gt; complete NOS
&gt; set.  If anybody is interested in it, I will inquire further.

Canvas- at least $2000 if split window? Beware several bay window  
tilts trying to be passed as split window. Hoops- $1200-1500+-????
OG hoops selling for $600-800+-, saw a set of very nice SC hoops, og  
bows, &amp; spreader bar for $1000 _at_ BOR last weekend, don't know if they  
will get it?

YMMV,

&gt;
&gt; I was looking for a crewcab set-up, since the PO decided cab-height  
&gt; was
&gt; better, and found these.  I might just buy it and sell off the tarp  
&gt; and
&gt; wood.
