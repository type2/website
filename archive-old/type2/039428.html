Subject: Old Volks Home

Thanks to all who came to my defense. I am known as Type 2 parts_dot_com and
also Old Volks_dot_com. I have dropped the HOME due to conflicts with Jim
Thompson and his now defunct Old Volks Home (I know he did watch the list).
I have owned and operated Old Volks Home of Az. for the last ten years and
in the last 2 years have slowly built up my mail order business. I am a bus
owner (I own at least 10 from 1955 Barndoor delux to over 7 loafs from 1968
to 1978) The loafs are generally dismantled for used parts and sheet metal
or sold as rust free shells for those that have everything but a good body.
I have known Jim Thompson for 4 years and am sorry to see him disappear like
he did. I will be here for the duration and am at most west coast shows, I
try to always make myself available for those that care.

again Thanks to all that came to my defense.
