in my 69 westy there is nothing supporting the transmission.  i usually
just put an old screw jack under it so i can adjust the height of it when
i have to install the engine.

and on the subject of gas heaters:

my 69 westy has the gas heater under the seat that is behind the drivers
seat.  i think it is a stewart warner, but i havent looked at it lately.
i never use it, but i do turn it on occasionally and it puts out heat.  
anybody else have one like this?

joe

69, 74 westy
