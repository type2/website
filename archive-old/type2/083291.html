Subject: Westie Brackets? 

--=====================_889472414==_

hi there everyone..this is my first time posting to the list. thanks for the resource. 
anyways..i have a 1970westie. my first vdub.  
and i'm curious about a couple oddball parts on my bus. 
i've already searched the library and didn't find any clues there, so...i've come to u all. 
first off, i have an inside bracket on each side of both of my front doors. 
what went here? it looks like it's a factory option. and that they've definately been used in the past. possibly supports for a child's cot? 
also i have a strange bracket of sorts on my front bumper on the driver side. and it too looks like a factory option. any ideas? 
a gr8ful peace out to u and yours, -chris in E.Oregon

btw; lovin my virtually new 1600longblock from BAP.
