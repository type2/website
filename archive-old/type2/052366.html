Subject: [T2] Extractor Exhaust

Volks:

I need to find an extractor to go with my CIS conversion.  Any
suggestions on price/value?  Does the bus require a different muffler to
be on the correct side? Also, I want to retain the heater box
connections. How do I connect them with an extractor?

thanks
