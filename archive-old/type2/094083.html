&gt; 1.) Carrying extra gear/people.  I've been know to put 300-400 pounds
&gt; behind my rear seat and another 600-800 pounds in the floorboard.  This is
&gt; bound to increase the rear axle weight from 1860 to 2500 or more.

Getting close to the structural limit of the bus according to the doorjam.

&gt; 4.) The ever-popular and always-feard cross-wind and blow-by from freight
&gt; trucks (and Suburban drivers who are convinced that triple digit speeds are
&gt; safe).
&gt; 
&gt; Any of these conditions will increase the weight on one or more of your tires.
&gt; But when you start stacking these conditions together, you can see why you
&gt; really need some tires that'll handle 1.5 to 2.0 times the empty weight of
&gt; your 
&gt; bus.

Good points.  Is the GAWR values on the doorjam are to be adhered to then a
1400 lbs spec tire at maximum inflation would be almost at it's limit when
the bus is fully loaded, and that's standing still.

So I guess the rule of thumb is to use D load range tires if you plan to
totally load your bus down regularly if you worry about safety.  My
experience has been a loaded down bus handles better anyway. ;-)
