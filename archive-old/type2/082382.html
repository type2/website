Subject: Colgan Front End Protector F/S

Greetings esteemed list,

	I have a Colgan front end bra for a '68-'72 bus with cutout for
spare.  It is new in box, never even put on my bus, as I chose to fix the
nose damage rather than cover it up after I had ordered it.  I originally
paid $99.95 for the bra from Bus Depot (PR64S), but since I have no real use
for it, I will let it go for $50.00 + shipping.  I am also open to
interesting trades if that is more your style. 

							Best Regards,
							Jay Brown
