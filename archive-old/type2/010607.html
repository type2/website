&gt; List Members,
&gt; I know a lot of you of late are looking on info
&gt; on GEX products well, here's a website to get you
&gt; started:
&gt; http://www.gex_dot_com/

I don't seem to remember that a &quot;lot&quot; of us have been looking for this
website...

To put it charitably, GEX hasn't gotten good press on this group,
either for the quality of their work or for their business practices.

My own experience is that I had to remind them twice before they
finally returned my core charge _two_ months after I delivered the core
personally to their plant.  Both times, I was told that the check was
in the mail, and it finally arrived postmarked two days after my second
phone call.

Consider your options carefully before you part with your hard-earned
money.

George
