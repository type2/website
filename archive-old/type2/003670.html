Hi all
I was at the Local Pumpkinfest today!  Fall Fair time of the year, the trees
are Crimson and bright yellows.. and the sky was absooolutly Blue!  No
clouds,, a super sunny day!  I was wearing my shorts!
What a huge surprize to see soooo many cars,,, They packed in over 1000
vehicles,,
I only wish I could have driven the Westfalia,, But I had alot of fun with
the 57 Beetle,, watching all the punch buggy game players!!
I loaded a few pictures to my site,, there Is one Bus ,,, Cherie was able to
be there with her family and the 73 Bus,, their Bug was too late arriving
and they couldn't fit it in the park!
If your interested,, look here,  http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/1.htm
Thanks
