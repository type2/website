Subject: Type 4 dual carb spark plugs

Hi all,
Chasing new plugs at the moment.
I have used Bosch W8CC and Beru 14-7 AU plugs in the past.
I was wondering if there is any benefit in going for the new 4 electrode
styles they both produce??
Bosch super4 (WR78??)
Beru UltraX (part number???)
Thanks,
Richard
Brisbane Australia.

PS This is for a new stock re-built motor (2L dual carb)
I will also be adding compufire ignition to stock leads + coil.
