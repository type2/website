&gt; Two years ago, I bought a Berg exhaust analyzer[...] I mounted the sensor so

&gt; screws but could not get the LED to move off of &quot;totally lean&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone suggest an explanation for this? I've since removed the dual
&gt; quite pack from my  Westy and replaced it with a stock muffler, so I can't
&gt; put it back into the old configuration to test the sensor itself.
&gt;
&gt; My questions:
&gt; 1. Is my stick-it-in-the-end-of-the-tailpipe approach flawed?

Yes it is for an unheated sensor

&gt; 2. Should the sensor (which has its own heater) supposed to get hotter than
&gt; the 200F that my thermocouple read?

The comment about the sensor having it's own heater has me wondering.
Typically the unheated sensors want to see around 600F in order to work
properly.  It's tricky getting one in there with the heat exchangers and stock
muffler arrangement.  The self heated sensor that you have requires +12V for an
internal heater should not be so finiky about the temperature of the exhaust
gas.  I don't know if that type of sensor will give you proper results out
there at the pea shooters, but it might not be the location, but the heater
connection.
I would check
1. Do you have a good low resistance path to ground for the outside case of the
sensor?
2. Without power connected, can you read some resistance between the +12V
terminal of the sensor and ground.  I suspect that this should be 50 ohms or
less
3. With power connected and an ammeter in series with the power lead, do you
measure any current through the heater.

I suspect one of two things,
   1. the sensor is not properly grounded, resulting in not enough current
through the heater
   2. the heater has opened and not functioning at all.

&gt; 3. Has anyone found an emissions checker who is willing to let the owner
&gt; tune his own carb during the test?

Can't help you with that one.
