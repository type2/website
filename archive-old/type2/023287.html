Subject: Re: [T2] Backwards dist. drive


&gt;If it is positioned wrong, you simply lift it up off of its mating gear, 
&gt;rotate it, and drop it down in the correct position.  The
&gt;complicating factor is that it takes a special tool to get hold of the 
&gt;drive gear.


You can pull the drive out of the engine with a blunt end #2 pencil. Just 
go buy a pack, they're cheap - I ruined a couple before I got the drive out 
of the '81 Beetle engine I had problems with.

I sent this little blurb to the Muir folks while I was stationed in Naples, 
Italy and they actually printed it in the back of the 'Compleat Idiot' book 
in the 'Hints and Techniques' Section in back.

Found this edition of the book in a book store in Key West, FL while my 
ship was in port and I got so excited I showed everyone near me - guess I 
looked like a real looney. I don't normally send things to publishers... Or 
get things printed in magazines or books.
