Hi- how did you do the O2 sensor hookup?
     I have a 78 that is also running rich a bit (plugs no fouled, however,
but exhaust pipe is black, and I get about 18 mpg), - but I attribute it to
age (nearly 200K on ORIGINAL engine).  If you can't pin it to one cylinder
(leaky injector-look at plugs), then consider cyl temp sensor or air sensor
(in airbox) or leaky cold start valve (5th injector) or excess fuel
pressure (return flow not adjusted right), or air metered wrong- I'd have a
spare airbox to check latter- or perhaps someone can post the correct
resistances for different levels of throttle?  MB
