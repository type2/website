Subject: can't engage any gear

I recently posted this to the list, got a few responses, but need
additional advice.

 In September, I pulled the 1776 from my '71 Westy and began a rebuild
which I finally finished last weekend. The engine now sits on a test stand
and runs well.

In the meantime, I bought a rebuilt trans (from the infamous Todd Hill, no
less) and mounted it in the bus, waiting for the magic day.  Two weeks ago,
I sat in the driver's seat and fantisized about driving again. I pushed the
stick around but could not move it into any of the gear positions.

Several listees suggested that the trans might be hanging at an awkward
angle and that this might account for the problem.  I happen to have
measured the trans-to-driveway distance before pulling the engine the last
time so I could reset this height when I next install the engine. Today, I
jacked up the trans to this height, then moved it all around, but could not
engage the gears.

As you can imagine, I am really reluctant to go to the trouble of
installing the engine, only to find that I really do have a shifting
problem.

A thought:  is it possible that,  for a newly rebuilt trans, it is
necessary to have the engine turning the mainshaft in order to shift gears?
If so, I would go ahead and install the engine. If not, I guess I'll pull
the trans and explore the problem.

Thanks for any help.

Jack
