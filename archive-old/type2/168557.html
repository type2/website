Subject: Fwd: [T2] Re: No Fire on #2 and #4?

Tom and Martin:
Tom: Your experience is of great interest to me. Of all the many 
times I've pulled a plug and listened for an rpm drop, I think I've 
gotten one only twice.  I've never understood this. So I'm hoping 
that the list members pass on some ideas.

Martin: Re the vacuum leak possibility:  Help me out here. Would such 
a leak be consistent with a change on #1 and #3, but not on 2 and 4?

Jack
