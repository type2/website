   Putting an '81 into my '73 wasn't difficult. I used a &quot;rotary file&quot;
chucked into a drill to remove the excess humps inside the bellhousing
to make the bigger clutch and flywheel fit, and then used a starter for
a automatic to get around that problem. When you are grinding away on
the bellhousing, you just keep sticking the flywheel w/coverplate bolted
on into the hole every so often to see if it fits all the way yet. Same
thing you have to do to fit a 1500cc engine into a 1200cc bug tranny.
Watch out you don't grind too much off and make a hole in the case. I
had to plug one up with silicon.
   A better solution is to take the bellhousing off a junk 091 tranny
and use that on the 002 tranny you have in there. Then you can use the
regular starter too. That's what I'll do next time around.
   Other than that, it was just a matter of putting the older
crossmember on the newer engine, and deleting the rear-most tin and
bending the crap out of the front-most tin.
