Subject: Re: Plugs &amp; Compression testing(2)

I thought that this was answered.

Do your compression test hot (or at least pretty warm).

To minimize risk of stripping the spark plugs threads *always* use the
appropriate anti-sieze (but not too much -- fouls the plugs).

If you don't have anti-sieze on 'em now, then by all means, pull them out
when the engine is stone cold -- and PUT SOME ON!  Then you will be as safe
as possible when you have to pull them hot for a compression test.

Champion Spark Plugs have a manual available for spark plug info.  I recall
they suggest a small amount of anti-sieze be used, like a thin stripe up one
side only.  It was said here that copper or aluminum based ones were proper.
I also recall using molybdenum disulphide anti-seize with good results, too.

Unless you are talking *some* kinds of self locking bolts, putting anti-seize
on all of your fasteners will bring a smile to your face next time you have to
work on your car.  With the quality of work typical of my repairs, that's
sooner rather than later -- I buy anti-sieze in the big jars.

If you, like me, always use stainless hardware whenever you can, you *really*
want to use this stuff.  Stainless welds itself together bigtime.  If you
really want to go first class, use monel (or monel nuts/stainless bolts).

Boy did I digress....
