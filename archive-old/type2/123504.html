&lt;&lt; I used to work there and saw so many returns (some dead out of the box) 
that I am very suspicious about anything electrical from Advance.... Cheapest 
supplier. A better part for a bit more is cheaper than a ride home on the 
towtruck... I usually shop for the cheapest supplier too but Advance is not in my 
loop... &lt;grin!&gt;

I wonder if this sort of product operates under Gresham's Law (Bad money
drives out good...), to the extent of being so cheap (cost-wise) as to price
out reputable products. After all, the big chain stores buy almost solely
on price, depending on volume for profit...
