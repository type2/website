&gt; I really envy you. Here in PA, I'm lucky to see a bus driving down the
&gt; road once every month or two. The ones I do see are almost all late 
&gt; 70's
&gt; models. As for splitties, I drive past maybe one a year if that. I've
&gt; noticed a sharp decrease in the number of busses I pass, of any 
&gt; vintage,
&gt; over the last five or ten years.

Despite the earthquakes, high cost of living, and Austrian governor, we 
are truly blessed in California.

Today I took my bus for a short drive around town, first time it's been 
moved further than &quot;the next parking spot because of street cleaning 
day&quot; for a couple of weeks.  I needed to run a short errand to a 
friend's house, but took the long route because one of my lifters had 
bled down and I wanted the noise to go away.

So, I pulled out of my parking spot and headed west.  Being Labor Day, 
the Great Highway was absolutely packed with beach-goers.  There were 
no less than 6 bay windows (a couple of them Westies) in the parking 
lot along Ocean Beach.  After I turned onto Fulton, I passed 2 
air-cooled Vanagon Westies and an early bay Westy headed the other way 
(towards the beach -- good luck finding parking!).  After the drop-off 
at my friend's house, I took Fulton to Stanyan, along the eastern edge 
of Golden Gate Park, and past Haight St.  I waved to 2 bay Westy 
drivers while stopped at the Haight &amp; Stanyan light.

I think the number of sightings was increased due to the holiday (and 
people coming back from Burning Man), but it feels nice to be in such 
good bus-company out here.
