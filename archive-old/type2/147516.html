&gt; My problem seems to be that I cannot find TDC on my #1 cyl! When I

&gt; ADJUSTED the  gap at, ergo, there SHOULD be the requisite gap present
&gt; (or close. I  should mention the motor runs great, this was only

&gt; I'm doing.

I would like to add to the suggestions for you to confirm you do in fact 
have solid lifters. Should that engine have had the lifters replaced at 
some time in the past with hydraulic ones, the proper setting will yield 
no gap whatsoever. If you are sure the engine contains solid ones 
disregard this. (As at 74 it most likely does, but who knows what a PO 
might have done)
