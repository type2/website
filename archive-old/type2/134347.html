Subject: RE: [T2] Anyone in Portland OR?

Don,

If you can get me the address info, the name of the person, and any kind of
confirmation that I won't be thieving from a fellow busser, I would be more
than happy to pick these up for you...  But you have to admit that it sounds
sketchy at best.  I'm more than willing to help, but not if it means
robbery.

Please pmail me the info and I will be more than happy to help you.

p.s.  You'll never take me alive coppers!!!
