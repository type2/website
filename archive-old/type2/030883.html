&gt; Okay, I give up. I forgot to mark the rear engine mounting crossmember and now I don't know which direction it should go. One side of the crossmember is nice and curvy; the other side is pretty straight. Does the curved side go on the passenger or driver side of the bus?

jack the engine up in place, it will only fit one way (without forcing it)
