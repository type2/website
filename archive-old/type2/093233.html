Subject: [T2] Re: Free bus

Never heard from Kenny, hope he is okay - anyone else want a good sheet 
metal donor?

I went out last week to check on that bus front end and it looks very good. 
The headlight buckets and vent opening look very solid and damage free. The 
windshield opening is poor but no worse than the one my bus had. Basically 
I would just sandblast or wire brush it aggressively and use some metal 
impregnated filler to smooth it out and then paint it.

The front beam is also there. All the doors are there. The rockers look 
poor but the rear of teh bus is good including the corners back there.

Let me know what you want to do and when. I'll have to lead you out there 
as I can't even tell you how to get there. It is located approx. 15 miles 
west of Cookeville and approx. halfway between Nashville and Knoxville 
along I-40. It is about 10 miles from the interstate to the bus.

It is free and he wants it out of there. Parts only, no title.

Hope this helps you.

My phone number is: (931) 537-9719. I am there all weekend and during the 
week I check my e-mail many times a day. I don't have e-mail at home.

Take care.
