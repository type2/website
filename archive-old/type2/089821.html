&gt; I have replaced the water pump for the sink in my 75
&gt; westy with a &quot;handy pump&quot; found in a camper that was
&gt; given to me by a friend. This pump is the same that is
&gt; offered by bus depot for my 75. Well, the motor
&gt; turned, but the pump didn't pump. I thought what the
&gt; heck, it was free and all, so I pitched it and ordered
&gt; the same pump from BD. After a couple of months of
&gt; use, it began leaking water into the motor and
&gt; eventually failed (poor quality pump, or just bad
&gt; luck? I don't know). Does anyone have any good
&gt; experiences with a pump for this application? I have
&gt; looked for another 12 volt pump online, but all I find
&gt; is expensive ones that can drain a pool in 25 minutes.
&gt; For my westy, I need very little gpm/psi and I figure
&gt; there must be many inexpensive options out there. Any
&gt; insight from anybody.
