Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

Or the flame thrower that is being sold in South Africa. They use it to 
control car jacking. A flame thrower is mounted under the doors on one or 
both sides of the vehicle...

Their courts say it's legal - bet ours would not. The U.S. lawyers would 
have a field day....

Guess I am straying far from realistic VW solutions here so I'll be 
quiet... (But it is Friday).

You better be sure you get the right person though.


&gt;&gt;Most pro thieves don't bother with the ignition.  They just drive
&gt;&gt;up with a flat bed tow truck and load up.  Awful hard to fight that, short
&gt;&gt;of chaining the bus to something.
&gt;
&gt;This ought to stop anyone short of a flat bed equipped thief,
&gt;though that sort will get a *reward* for their knavery!
