Subject: Plugging fuel lines (was Re: [T2] pullling the engine)

Hi Volks,

Best tool I've heard for this application is the common golf tee. It's 
increasing radius makes it a universal fit and it costs only pennies.

Happy trails,

&gt;
&gt; You can squeeze the hose shut with medical forceps (I believe that is 
&gt; what they are called) but I have heard that this will split or weaken 
&gt; the rubber.
&gt;
&gt; I use either a Phillips head screwdriver or a pencil. If need be I use 
&gt; a hose clamp to squeeze the hose down on the pencil.
&gt;
&gt; Be sure that your rubber lines have at least a grommet any place where 
&gt; a rubber hose passes through the sheetmetal.
