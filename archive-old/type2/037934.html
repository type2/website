&gt; I've seen some catalogs where you determine which part is appropriate
&gt; for certain years by using the VIN as the cutoff (or 1/2 year). The last
&gt; six numbers of your VIN represent which number your bus was in the
&gt; production line for that year. You might want to go to the type2 library
&gt; and look up the M-codes to determine if your bus is really an &quot;early 72&quot;
&gt; or just has had some weird experiences down the line. October sounds
&gt; pretty early to me (my bus's birthday is 10/2/72, #29210 off the
&gt; assembly line), but model-year 72 was one of those transitional years
&gt; where serial number order could make a big difference.

    Then you get really strange situations like with my '73 Westy.

    It has two VIN#s...

    First is a '72 model year VIN# (DOM July '72) as an &quot;Unfinished Vehicle&quot;
before it was sent to WestfaliaWerke.  Once completed as a Campmobile, it then
received the '73 model year VIN# (DOM September '72).  The sequential/chassis
numbers of the VIN# did not change, only the model year identifiers.

    To make things worse, it is an Automatic....

    So, in essence I have a '72 Westy with automatic transmission without the
sunroof tracks in the roof opening (with a single carbed solid lifter 2.0L
engine, but we won't go into that...  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;).
