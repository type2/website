Subject: JC Whitney FI guage, parts and front end rebuild

I'm looking at the Fuel Injection Testers JC Whitney has in their VW 
supplement catalog on page 29, item # 12GE9407U for $29.95.  They list a 
100PSI kit that covers all except the C.I.S.-K-Jetronic Bosch Systems. 
Does anyone have one of these, will it work for the D-Jetronic on 914 
1.7L and 2.0L?

Also, I am going to rebuild the front end on my VW and have a couple of 
questions. I already have the correct ball joints.  What about the 
bushings in the torsion tubes themselves.  Haven't taken it apart yet. 
How do you evaluate torsion tube bushings? Are they still available?

In the JC Whitney VW supplement catalog they advertise Urethane 1 piece 
front end bushings for $26.99 a set. Anyone actually used these,  The ad 
says to just push the original inner bushing (which is hard to remove) 
farther into the tube where it won't interfere with the torsion tubes. 
True?  I've never used a urethane part yet but recall messages about 
them squeaking?

Also on page 8 they list High-Performance Anti-Sway bars and Stainless 
Steel Sway Bar Clamp Sets. They don't list brand names on these but they 
sound like the Sway-Away brand.  Anyone actually buy these who can tell 
me the brand. How do I tell if the sway bar I have now is OK?

Thanks,
Jeff
