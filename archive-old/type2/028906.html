As far as I know the 091 tranny came into play in '76 and stayed the same at
least through '79. They should be the same engine as well. Get one more
conformation, before you buy, but $1.00 says your good to go with the engine
swap. 79 is a unique year with heat exchangers. Putting your old 78 engine
in is a good way to get rid of that stuff.

Subject: [T2] 78 Westie


I have a chance to buy a 78 westie. I currently have a 79 westfakia with a
new AVP engine in it. Should I be able to bolt the AVP right up to the 78?
are the tranys the same? The seller says that the engine is a 2000 and it is
fuel injected. Reading the Haynes and Bentley are really confusing with
respect to what year had what. If the VID helps it is 2382134207.

What I would really like to do is make two nice, good running Buses and
eventually sell one. How much of pain would it be to put the Westie interior
stuff into my Westfakia. The Westfakia stuff comes out with 3 screws or so..

Please let me know via the list or pmail asap because I have to give the
seller an answer. TIA!!!!
