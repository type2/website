have to agree here, I have had some of them fancy digital meters but an
old large faced analog meter that is acurate and has the mirror behind the
needle can be as accurate as any digital,  however it really reads an
&quot;average&quot; so if the circuit is pulsing or intermitent it really doesn't
respond very well.

although I did all of my FI trouble shooting with the analog meter. mine
will set very sensitive and read fractions of ohms.  (Radio Shack at least
ten years ago)

&gt; This is gonna sound funny, but... for auto work I prefer an old analog
&gt; radio sha** multimeter.  It was not more than about $12 and does all
&gt; things electrical.  I also have used digital and have a very expensive
&gt; digital meter...I hate it except that it talks to my pc.
&gt; 
&gt; You do need one with a fairly large face(all the better to read with).
&gt; 
&gt; You want one with the largest face and highest &quot;ohms/volt&quot; rating.
&gt;
