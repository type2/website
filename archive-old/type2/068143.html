Subject: Re: Ever live in your bus?

Hi!

Back when I had my super 1600 Porsche fired splittie I lived in it in 
Yosemite National Park. I was the only female member of the technical 
rock climbing rescue team and lived in Camp 4 which is the climber's 
camp. My metal flaked root beer brown ex-Sundial camper with white 
Jackman wheels and GNARLY mud and snows just sat in the parking lot and 
she was home for about 18 months. I had re-modeled the interior and the 
single bed ran along the side behind the driver's seat. It was a bench 
seat type with no walk through access and I installed inside shutters 
as &quot;curtains&quot; to divide the front from the back. There was a killer 
storage area under the bed and I left the sink and ice chest unit that 
came from Sundial. I trashed the water tank and spout to save weight. 
It DID NOT have a heater - but I *WAS* a hard bodied rock jock who 
owned a down bag rated to -40 degrees and an expedition down coat rated 
to -70 - so I was set. Food storage was in the Rescue Site where we had 
big steel boxes we called coffins. They were bear proof. I NEVER kept 
any food in the bus beacuse of the bears.

My main transportation was a Schwinn Varsity 10 speed but once a week 
I'd fire up the bus and take her for a cruise around the loop - out to 
El Cap or up to Badger Pass for some skiing. Twice a month I would go 
to Southern Cal. for surfing contests and I would live out of it at the 
beach. (This was in the 70s when you could get away with that kind of 
thing.)

The one thing that saved me - living in such a small area - is the fact 
that I am a TOTAL anal retent! &quot;A place for everything - and everything 
in its place!!!&quot; 

I LOVED my time in the dirt and relish the opportunity to hit the road 
in the bus I own now: Her Majesty - the bus that makes people smile!!! 
She's just a bus - no camping stuff at all. I just got back from a 4000 
mile road trip (solo) where I camped along the coast from Arcata to the 
Olypmic National Park - it was FABULOUS - all my camping gear lives in 
a Thule Magic Box roof rack on top of the Old Girl. I set up camp 
kitchens on the picnic table and when I'll solo, I sleep on the floor 
in the back of the bus! It's great fun.

Do yourself a BIG favor and buy a bunch of Rubbermaid &quot;Roughneck&quot; Tote 
tubs - organize your stuff - label them - stack them in the back - 
check the oil - buy some gas and a map and HIT THE ROAD!

:-)

HAVE FUN!

Kath and Her Majesty

P.S. Don't forget your John Muir book, all your tools A FAN BELT and 
some other parts. Ours live in a lockable Rubbermaid chest (purple and 
turquoise - thank you very much!).
