Subject: Oil Temp Sender Wire Length

So, I read somewhere that you should not cut the length the sending wire 
from a CHT sender, or risk getting incorrect temps. Does the same hold true 
for an oil temp sender?

I have the sump plate sender, but the VDO gauge is reading (what I consider 
to be) low. If the (18 AWG) wire length does matter, what's the correct 
length?

Thanks -

Mike
