Subject: Re: [T2] Best source for temp gauges..

Hi Don,

I have used a VDO CHT for a couple years now. I don't think it needs  
to be super accurate... I am using it for trend-spotting. While it's  
true that the weather here can vary by 50 degrees or more from one  
day to the next, that 50 degrees is rarely critical.

My engine runs between 350 and 450 on the highway depending on speed,  
load, prevailing winds and surface grades. If it's over 450F I don't  
bother worrying about temperature differentials, I just ease off on  
the gas pedal and watch to se the temps fall off.

Fr'instance: Coming back from EveryBus 2004 I was just north of Fort  
Erie when I noticed that the engine was struggling to keep up to  
60MPH and the head temps were running up over 475. Since I wasn't on  
a hill I was a bit confused until I put a hand out the window and  
realized I was running into a 40MPH headwind. I dropped down to third  
gear and limped along at 50MPH with the hazards on for a while until  
the road finally turned away from the wind.

Bottom line: For me it's plenty useful without the need for math. A  
heck of a sight better than no gauge at all.

Happy trails,

&gt; Dakota Digital are the most accurate from the reports here and on  
&gt; the Samba,
&gt; but I think the digital displays are FUGLY. VDO are not only  
&gt; inaccurate, but
&gt; you have to know the ambient temps and do some math for it to be of  
&gt; any use.
&gt; Ugh.
