DOH!
Ok, I admit it, I have had a lot of stuff on my mind, VW, Wedding, Work, 
Wedding, VW,  and so on.. I am on the Airs List, forgot to mention it, 
Use to be on it in FL when I lived there a couple of years ago, but just 
signed back on for NYC area, and Yeah, I will be taking a list with me.
It was really more of a open call to all the VW freaks out there that 
have taken there beloved busses cross country looking for a few of the 
more VW friendly lands of awe and wonder. And seeing the amount of 
Possitive feedback I have gotten so far I know I was never wrong about 
the true nature of those that Love there VWs, It just makes you feel all 
warm and gooey inside.. :)

Dave
