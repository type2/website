Subject: Re: [T2]When did all the camping start&gt;?

Last summer I travelled thru Montana.  We stopped at Deer Lodge I think, The sign said Frontier
Montana where there is a prison museum with a car display.

The Car display has an Early Bay Bus, a 62 Beetle , a Karhmann Ghia, and a Mad Max Dune Buggy....

Back to the point,, they also had an early camping display,, very cool!  But not volkswagen

They had the 1918 Model T with the RARE side tent! ,,  kinda looked like a teepee on the side of
the T
A canvas tarp as such drapped over the car body, then propped up with a couple of wooden poles...

a few days later we came upon a Neon with the rare side tent toooo... a blue tarp jammed in the
drivers door, over the roof and tied to the trees.

we had to set up our camper with the real side tent just to show em how camping is really done!
