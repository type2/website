Subject: Re: blowing oil and speed

Good question about the speedometer, I had to replace the cable once because 
the LAPD towed it and bent my tie rod and broke the cable, I should do the 
drive along me test.
    In response to speed... My bus loves to go 70 mph (all German parts on 
rebuild) in fact she's crying out for more, I've had this same engine in for 
12 yrs now and 60,000 miles and never a major problem. Been back and forth 
the country 3 times in it, through the Rockies etc. Carried tons of heavy 
musical equipment. I do believe in babying a bus by keeping everything 
adjusted, etc., oil clean and the right weights but I want to be able to 
drive it too at posted speeds except long hills of course (did ya ever notice 
all those diesel fumes...10-4) The issue was the oil here.
