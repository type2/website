Subject: Heater Hose

'79 2.0L California emissions bus:

I am looking for the hose that runs between the heater blower motor and 
the heater box extension tube on the passenger side.  THis is a funky 
plastic tube with a round connection at the blower, and an oval shaped 
connection at the heat exhchanger extension tube.

The regular paper style hose will not work due to the oval connector at 
one end.

Does anybody know where this hose can be obtained as a replacement or 
have a method for fabricating a replacement?

Thanks

Timatt
