Subject: [T2] hydraulic lifter questions ... PLEASE HELP   (long)

or, Why I Think Hydraulic Lifters Suck

I have a rebuilt AVP 2L w/ hydraulic lifters that replaced the tired solid
lifter engine in my 77. a little more than 3000 miles on it. I'm currently
running Castrol HD SAE30

whenever i first start the motor cold (and especially on cold mornings), i
have a low idle (~650 ?) and the engine misses, and occasionally a tapping
noise. the oil light takes 2-3 seconds to go out, whereas on the old motor,
it went out immediately upon startup (even with 165000 miles under its belt)
If i rev it up some, it goes faster but the motor does not speed up smoothly
and still misses. i have to sit in the driveway and hold the rpms at 1500 or
so for a couple minutes before the engine runs evenly, and once i do this,
it idles normally ~900rpm.  this also happens to a smaller degree every time
i start the motor warm too (low idle, gotta rev it a couple times), even if
it's only been off for a few minutes.

this also plays mind games when i tried to do a compression test a couple
weeks ago. I got 120 and 130 on the 1/2 side, and 97 97 on the 3/4 side. i
did the test with engine warm, throttle wide open. i squirted oil in the
spark plug holes on the 3/4 side, they came up to 105 on both.

should i be worrying about rings in my recently rebuilt motor or could i
have low compression because my hydraulic lifters on that side of the motor
had bled down in the time it took me to remove my spark plugs and attach the
comp. tester?

would a lighter oil help them pump up faster?? i have 30W in there now.
10W30? 20W50 ( is that lighter or heavier than 30W?)?

the engine runs great once the lifters pump up, smooth and powerful and cool
and nice.


i've looked at the procedure online for bleeding hydraulic lifters. it's
directed toward buses with their original engines and lifters. it seems very
time consuming, and it also says that the first startup will be great, but
it doesn't really help on subsequent startups, it says the tapping will be
back b/c the lifters will still bleed down pretty easily.

sure it's great to not have to do valve adjustments, but i wonder how many
problems might be covered up by the hydraulic lifters (recessing valve
seats? rings, in my case? who knows what else?).

has anybody ever heard of a running compression test?? how do you do it?? it
seems like the lifters would definitely be pumped up with the engine
running, even if on 3 cylinders.

TIA for any input on the matter, or please relate similar experiences (or
even opposite experiences) concerning hydraulics.

peace!
