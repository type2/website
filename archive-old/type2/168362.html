&gt; By this I mean, if the steering wheel is pointing at 7 o'clock and
&gt; 1 o'clock, as I turn the wheel to the right, it would be slack
&gt; until 9-3 o'clock or 10-4 o'clock. Hope that makes sense. I've gotten
&gt; pretty good at driving this way on a windy day. :)

    Fix whatever's wrong! This is sorta/maybe OK on the flat but could
turn really nasty on a long downhill... ;-(
