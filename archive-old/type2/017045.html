&gt; Hey everyone!
&gt;
&gt; My throtle cable seems to be sticking a lot lately and I want to deal
&gt; with it once and for all.

I have had this problem since I bought my bus, so Im gonna try Al's
fixes too. Some things I have done to improve the situation:

replace/ repack the accelerator cable.

replace the accleerator rteturn spring the one on mine was way too week.

greese the hinges under the pedal. I think my problem is tha being a
beach bus, tyhis hinge is worn out. Now its just sticky on really cold
days. Hopefully this summer Ill have time to replace it. After the new
shoks, ball joint, tires, rear brakes. etc.
