Subject: 2.8ohm resister in double relay. 

Well, my double relay tested bad, so I took off the cover, and MAN,
their simple. So I'm going about rebuilding it. The diodes test out
fine, the actuators(relays) work (the number 1 contact is kinda pitted,
but should work fine for another few months untill I get it all up and
running and start replacing the 'iffier' parts. The circuit for
85(ground) was burned through so I re-wired/re-solderd that up and it's
testing fine now. Yay! The only part I'm stuck on is the resister. My
wheels ain't running, and it's a 2hour bus ride to radio shack, Soooooo,
what I'm wondering is does this actually have to be EXCACTLY 2.7 Ohms?
Or is AROUND 2.7 Ohms good enough?  And secondly, does anyone know of
anything else that might be found around the hous that SHOULD have
2.7Ohm, 1/2Watt resister in it that could be taken out for the ole bus? 
 
Thanks in advance
