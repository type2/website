Subject: Re: rubber spacers

I found a pretty good substitute at Home Depot, I think they're end caps for drainage pipes. They are black rubber and come in a variety of sizes, I think mine was ~1.5 inches and cost about $1.25.  Find them in the section where they have all the black plastic elbow joints.  

They seem to be rigid enough to support the rack as well as being able to flex over the bumpy parts of your travels.

Hope this helps (I think there are other suggestions either in the library or in the archives as well),
