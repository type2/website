Subject: Thermostats...
Content-Disposition: inline

Hi all,

In keeping with the recent thread on cooling and thermostats, I'm 
about to install a new 1600cc DP motor in my '67 Westfalia just in 
time for the upcoming &quot;Busses By The Arch&quot; event.  In fact, VW 
Trends editor Henry DeKuyper is flying in to experience and cover 
the event by using and staying in this Bus at the event.  Anyway, 
the engine is built on a &quot;AH&quot; case of about 1973 or '74 vintage.  
It features brand new factory DP heads (ported and polished), 
match-ported manifolds and extractor exhaust, dual 34 ICT Weber 
carbs, new graphite pistons and cylinders, Eagle &quot;Cheater&quot; cam, 
Berg pressure relief oil pump, full flowed case with teflon coated 
steel braided lines to a remote Fram HP-1 filter, and most everything 
in the motor, new or used, has been balanced to within a &quot;knats ass&quot; 
of perfection by our local race engine guru.  The compression is 
about 7.5 : 1 and I will only use preimum gas.  The goal was a perfect 
balance of strength, reliablity, good cooling, and power for this Bus.  
I insisted on installing the cooling vanes and thermostat in the 
doghouse fan shroud, and here is my question and the reason 
for this post.  I have various good used thermostats and noticed 
that some have stamped into them what I believe is a  temperature 
degree range.  Some have 65-70 degrees ranges, while others 
have 75-80 degree ranges.  Does anyone have info that explains 
which (or what other) thermostat is correct for what engines?  Does 
anybody have a VW workshop manual that breaks this info down 
accurately?

Thanks for any help.  If we're gonna do this, we might as well do it
right!!!
