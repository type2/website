Subject: Air compressors available

Should be safe to post this on Friday.

I have two air compressors available.

FREE:
This on is a portable Craftsman
2 HP, 220V Century motor
20 gallon tank
100 PSI Max
7.5 SCFM _at_ 40 PSI
6.1 SCFM _at_ 90 PSI
     Works fine, fills to pressure and cuts on and off.  Not enough pressure 
to do anything big though.  Cord has been cut and spliced back together at 
some time.  Plastic belt cover has a crack in it.  Wheels are really loose 
and wobbly.  Handle used to lift the one end and roll it is missing.

$100 OBO:
an OLD Worthington
By Worthington Pump and Machinery Works
Has patent dates of 1912, 1915, and 1920
Fitted with a 1HP Craftsman Capacitor type motor, probably from the 50's or 
so??
120 V
I am guessing the tank size at around 20-30 gallons.  It's a welded seamed 
tank.
Unknown CFM, but It runs up to 150 PSI and will run my DA for maybe a 30 
count before it starts back up again and the tool slows down.
This thing is HEAVY, actually, make that HEAAAAVY for it's fairly small size 
:-)  Two people can lift it but they are going to grunt and maybe cuss when 
they do.
It's an antique, has oiling cups for the bearings and a leather strap belt.  
It's in fair condition, not rusty, and it works fine.

I have pictures of both and will PM them on request.  These are PICKUP ONLY.

Jaybird
1973 Campmobile
1965 Type I (coming along nicely)
Clinton, MD
