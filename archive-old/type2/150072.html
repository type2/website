Subject: Re: [T2] Jet recommendations for PDSIT's?

Hi Don,

Here at close to sea level I did well with 132 mains when I converted  
the westfakia from a dual-carbed 1.8L up to a 2L in the summer of  
2003. I used Mikuni Jets sourced through a local Yamaha motorcycle/ 
snowmobile tuner.

My research at that time indicated that 1.7L engines used 127.5 jets,  
1.8L used 130's, and in markets with carbed 2L T4 engines the 132 was  
the jet used.

You'll have to make your own decision about the altitude  
compensation, I have no expertise in that.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
