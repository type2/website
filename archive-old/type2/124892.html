Subject: Re: [T2] 1 bumper bolt cap left in the US

From: &quot;Christopher Flesher&quot; &lt;cflesher1_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt; For anyone who is interested, I know this is a hard-to-find part....
&gt; I located one black cap...
&gt; I know it's only one..but, it's probably the last one in the US, maybe the
world!

I have a set of 6 bumper bolt cover cap masters that I'm machining up for
production, thanks to Richard (I think!?)  I'll have them in just about any
color that you could want, but due to business concerns (as in slooooow
business), I'm unable to set up the production molds for now.

Just how large a market do we have for these little darlings?
