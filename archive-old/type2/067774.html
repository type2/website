Subject: Re: oh no! Parts Place on the list!!!! -Reply

&gt;It's bad business practice to send out free parts...how do I know that
&gt;you are ever going to send the old ones back, and how do i even know
&gt;that they were wrong in the first place... This is not because I don't trust
&gt;the customers i deal with, it is just asking for more trouble than it is
&gt;worth. Secondly I could have sent you out the correct driveshafts out
&gt;immediately and even split the shipping charge with you if you would
&gt;have been willing to pay for the new driveshafts... then when the wrong
&gt;ones finally got to us, we would then refund your money for the wrong
&gt;ones.

        Here's where I beg to differ. If *I* order something and get the
wrong part, I'll be a bit put out if someone says I have to buy *BOTH* the
right and *WRONG* parts, then get a refund later. When I buy parts I don't
usually have a couple extra hundred dollars hanging around-if I did I'd be
buying Harley Davidson parts, not VW. Were I in the above situation, I
would be financially unable to comply, and therefore would be out both
parts AND cash because of a vendors mistake (I would also likely call my
card co. and tell them not to pay the charge, and take my business
elsewhere). And if the mistake is a vendor mistake, I expect *ALL* shipping
costs to be paid by them-which is exactly what happend when I got a bad
keyboard from MacWarehouse. I've been recommending that company to everyone
I know looking for mac accessories ever since. Wasn't too much trouble for
them, and it's paid off.

        I also have a hard time with the lack of trust for the customer.
The american judical system is theoretically based on innocent until proven
guilty, I'd like the same courtesy from a parts vendor- i.e. smart until
proven a moron. To a business the size of parts place, that one extra
driveshaft doesn't deplete the finances to the point of not paying the
rent, but to the customer it might very well do just that. And if that's
more trouble than it's worth, then I'll happily call RMMW next time, thank
you very much.

        My $.02 on the state of business today...

Peace,
