&gt; Regarding my previous thread on my bad decel valve. The Bosch part number on
&gt; my valve is 0 280 160 303. VW number is 022 133 551 B. I was able to find one
&gt; in a local salvage yard in a '75 bus. The Bosch number on it is
&gt; 0 280 160 300 with VW number 022 133 551 A. Now, will the valve I got from the
&gt; '75 replace the one in my '78 without any consequence. When I did a part
&gt; search on the Bosch site, it lists the 303 for 75-78. I am wondering if there
&gt; is any vacuum pressure difference from the early FI to the later that would
&gt; not allow me to use the 300 on my bus.

These are always the hardest questions without any access to Bosch technical
data.

The difference is that you have a part matched for a 1.8L engine and are
putting it on a 2L engine. The difference many be unperceivable.
