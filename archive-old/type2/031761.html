&gt; ok supposing that this engine in the 78 is complete, how much would it cost
&gt; me to have it rebuilt? it is a 2.0 liter i assume. does anyone have a
&gt; running one for sale? by chance.

I shelled out about $1,000 to GEX for one and it lasted less than 3,500
miles.
I then did it &quot;RIGHT&quot; and it was pretty close to $2,500 to do it myself
and with a machinist's help on the bottom end.  you could probably get a
fair to good job for about 1,500 but it takes some carefull work.

pretty good used engines can be had for under $500 if you know how to
check em out,  I only paid $125 for my 1700 411 engine and it ran as soon
as it was installed, BUT it was still an old engine and had a lot of
little problems.  I only used it for a spare while working on my main
engine and it lasted 5 years or so until I had to let it go because of
lack of space to store it.  (a list member got it from me when we cleaned
out the garage on Central Ave. Dave W, don't know what he did with it, I
think he was just going to use it for parts)
