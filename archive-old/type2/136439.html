Subject: re: first time buying a bus.

Rusty..
  Look for rust! (no pun intended.) battery tray area is one trouble
spot to look at.. depends where you are at as to how severe rust
problems
may be.... most mechanical items are an easy fix compaired to body
work..
IMHO  If the bus is in great cosmetic condition you will be way ahead.
Also look at the wiring under the dash.. if it has lotsa splices in it
then you may have headaches down the road... invest in a manual and
look at the pics in it vrs. what you are seeing on the bus.. such as in
the engine compartment... the closer to stock the better.

&gt; Help Needed,  
&gt;  
&gt; I'm going to look at a 78 Champagne Edition II micro soon, to
&gt; purchase.  This will be my first bus.  Does anyone have any useful
&gt; information to check out on the bus or any info online.  There is not
&gt; a lot out there on these.  Thanks
&gt;
