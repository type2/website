Thanks to all for your inputs....Clara's comment &gt;&gt;&quot;A sudden leak... 
hm.   How much oil are you losing in how long?&quot;&lt;&lt; led me to believe I'd better tell more of the underlying facts here.  My stock 1600 dp with oil bath filter motor didn't have any leaks at all as of last week.  We recently moved to Colorado and I decided I needed a little more power to climb these &quot;hills&quot; up here.  I pulled the motor out of the bus to put on thermo flaps, and some new cooling tin etc.  while the motor was out I sprayed it with paint remover (the builder had painted it gloss red) and then repainted it flat back.  Some water, paint remover etc. &quot;may&quot; have fell in the case in front of the oil slinger washer...I blew it out with an air compressor just in case.  I reinstalled the motor with dual carbs with a funky plastic elbow supposably sucking the crankcase outlet into the top of a KN filter. All hoses, connections, etc. are new, so there are no blockages.  I just don't know if the KN connection just doesn't provide for a positive enough suction, or if I have so!
me crap behind the pulley/oil slinger area.  To finish answering Clara's question, it is dumping a lot of oil--enough to spray the windshields of people driving behind me and totally trash out my engine compartment with dripping oil.  Does this give any new perspective?
