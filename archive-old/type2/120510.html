Subject: Re: [T2] 1.8 L engine ?

&gt; What did this engine come out of, AP 008197X .  My
&gt; books don't cover it.

The AP-engine is 1800cc like you mentioned in the
subject. It is a twin carburettor engine and was used
in the Baywindow during modelyears 1974 and 1975.

The engine is without exhaust emission control so it
was not used on US and Canadian buses.

The 'X' at the end of the nr means it was probably
revised at some time (by VW if the VW-logo with
recycling arrows is stamped near the enginenr)


yours,


Vincent
