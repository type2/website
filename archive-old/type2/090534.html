Subject: Re: [T2] Torqueing front hubs

&gt; Front hubs? What year is this? Is this something that you torque? What are the torque specs?
&gt; I always just got them snugged up to take the slack out of the bearing and then loosened them up just barely enough that they spun freely...but not too freely.

You are correct sir(or maam [pc]),
They are most properly measured for adjustment the same way you measure
end play on your motors. Using a dial gauge or the feeler method they are
adjusted for .001 to .005&quot;.  One of the patron saints (muir or hoover
maybe) suggested that if you tighten the nut down snug and loosen it just
enough so you can move the thick washer with a screwdriver you will have
the correct adjustment.
Myself, I have a dial and feelers but have never adjusted the front
bearings the proper way, always opting for the washer/screwdriver
method.
