Subject: Administrivia - mail

We've been having some problems with the server.  First, the name
server has been flaky, so messages were being bounced back to the server
for no real good reason.  Then sendmail quit altogether.  

We're aware of the problems, and are trying to fix it.

A lot of your probably won't even get this message...
