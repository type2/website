	The only OTHER thing that occurs to me is that the exhaust valves
are too tight.  I know you said you'd done a valve-lash adjustment, but
that's the last thing I could consider.  Retorque the heads too.  I know
it's early, but it couldn't hurt.  Is your fan stock?  Late model?  early
non-doghouse fans don't move as much air.

Any chance you have your vanes completely shut?  I know if I was to
&quot;wire open&quot; the vanes on my Vanagon engine, and didn't have the spring
return in place on the control rod to guide me, I'd stand a good
chance of getting the vane position wrong, just because it's not
obvious which way they go.

&gt; Oh yeah, I forgot, no thermostat, vanes wide open.
