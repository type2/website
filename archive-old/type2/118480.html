Subject: Re: [T2] Hyd lifters and solid cam

From: Steve Elms

&gt; or too radical a cam (Webcam something).


Here we go again. This is why I never wanted to get involved again with this on the list.
STOP comparing apples and oranges. Go BACK to what I wrote and you will see I said STOCK VW solid cam and
STOCK VW hydraulic cam. I do not and will not use aftermarket parts and try to mismatch them.

Here is part of what I wrote:  &quot;Take a stock VW solid cam and a stock VW hyd cam to any cam
grinder and have him see if he can find a difference in the grinds between the two type4 cams.&quot;

I did not say anything about lift and duration. I just said GRINDS.

Here is what I said about lifters: &quot; I use very good USED VW lifters to keep the metal hardness the same. I do
not use aftermarket lifters because of the hardness difference.&quot;
