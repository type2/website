&gt;&gt;My trusty '71 Bus would love to come, I asked her last night,
&gt;&gt;but, alas, she feels too decrepid to come that far and brave the
&gt;&gt;Baja roads.
&gt;So nurse it along.  Virginia to Sandy Eggo &amp; back, mebbe fifty-four,
&gt;fifty-five hundred miles.  Sandy Eggo to Cabo &amp; back, another twelve hundred.
&gt; Call it seven thou, tops.  Thats three oil changes and a lube job.  You pull
&gt;into your driveway, all brown with your hair bleached out, sand in your
&gt;skivvies and salt in your ears, the bus falls apart.  But you did it.

You know, I am half way to doing that. It is not a camper, but I have
slept in it. The brakes are worn in the rear, but they can be replaced.

About border crossings, of which there are many stories and few
hard facts, I have a few questions: What about insurance? (My company
wont cover me more than 100 miles into Mexico) Do the border guards
check registration, or can I take a friends car? Am I being
overly anal about this stuff? What are the secret words to tell the
wife that I am quitting work and running to Cabo for a month?

I should be able to finesse getting the bus into shape, buckled
side metal and all, by then. I will just have to shift focus from the 
fastback to the Bus from now until then.
