Subject: Re: [T2] Fan Pulley removal 

The fan can be easily removed once all the other things that iare in the way
are removed.  Make sue that the timing scale is off and that the two pieces
of time in directly in front of the fan are removed.  Undo the thee bolts
around the centre bolt and pull it straight out.  It leaces the fan hub
behind attached to tthe end of the crankshaft.  Once the fan is out undo the
centre bolt and use a standard harmonic balancer puller to pop the fan hub
off.
