Dear Sean.

The VW Type 2 interior light switch you seek, has VW part number 111 955 511 
B.

However, in Great Britain, front and rear fog lights, must have a tell-tale 
warning light, to show when the fog light(s) are illuminated.

Use of fog lights, in other than fog or falling snow, carries a maximum fine 
of 1000 pounds sterling.

A better switch, having a VW Type 2 compatible switch knob, with three 
positions for the front &amp; rear fog lights, is listed in my 1976 Hella 
catalogue, with part number 6RE 011 596-001.

Regards.
               Nigel A. Skeet
