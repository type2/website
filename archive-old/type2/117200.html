Subject: junk yard report so cal

Well, went to the junk yard last night, ecology in willmington.  found a
late bus with auto tranny and engine if anyone is interested and another
with the engine inside the bus and another short block on the ground with
the fan shroud on it.  anyway, at least 3 sets of flaps, 1 thermostat, 2
f.i. bus fuel pumps 2 f.i. computers and various 73 and later bumpers etc.
also, one of the busses had it's ignition with the keys in it and they
turned very nicely so if one of you so cal late bay guys are needing an
ignition run down and pick it up before crushing.  almost forgot, they had
a couple of late westies in there and at least one of them had the fridge
and a few handles that looked to be in good shape.  a few curtains not
messed up on the non pop top westy and the pop top westy had good pop top
hardware.
