Subject: RE: [T2] accelerator cable linkage on transmission?

From the voice of experience, make sure the pivot arm on the tranny is NOT
BENT.  Mine was, the result of a sloppy installation by the PO.  Made it
impossible to achieve full-throttle, as the range of motion was reduced by
the shortening of the arc-length of the arm.

on the underside looking up on the passenger side (lft hand drive) about
two thirds the way to the front there will be a lever about 6 inches long
sticking up, just above the pivot point there will be a ball, press the
cup part of the accell linkage over the ball, put some light grease or
lube like 90weight oil in the cup before pressing it on.

hope this helps
