Subject: Re: [T2] Gear shifting trouble

i do not have to push
down to get into reverse.

Sounds like your shift plate is installed wrong. (the little metal plate
under the gear shifter assembly) If you took it out try putting it in
reverse from the way you have it. The first time I removed mine I was in a
hurry and didn't notice the way it sat in there. So it took a while of trial
and error before I got it right.
