Subject: Fw: BNNTA initial weather forecast looks great...

                Hi all,

  It's not that I ever completely trust a weather forecast completely, but it
sounds like we'll be blessed with unseasonably cool, pleasant temps for this
coming Labor Day holiday weekend and the &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #20&quot;
campout!  They say high temps of about 84 degrees, slight chance of
occassional showers on Friday south of St. Louis (great for us  - 2 hours
north of STL). Sunny skies throughout the weekend and slight chance of showers
on Monday.

  We're in the final stages of supply loading, and will be taking at least
three, maybe four of our VW's to the event.  Remember, all types and models of
VW's are welcome in the event campground, not just Busses, but only VW's will
be allowed to stay inside the group campground at Indian Creek Recreation Area
on Mark Twain Lake.  The scenic driving caravan and informal Bus show/awards
ceremony will be on Sat, the rest of the weekend is schedule-free for a
laid-back VW camping experience.  Sounds like there might be a rather
memorable party going on in a certain encampment on Sat evening...  If you'd
like more info on the BNNTA event, go to  http://www.bnnta_dot_com  for details
and directions.  So pack 'em up and please drive safely and we'll see you
soon!
