Subject: Dual manifold hookup in a '73

I have a '73 with dual carbs on and this bus hasn't run under my care yet.
The PO unhooked everything and didn't label.  Anyway I have dual manifolds
that each have one bolt on connection that runs a pipe between them and
also two push on connections, one near the top and one on the opposite
side facing bottom.  Can anyone tell what these push on connections run
to?  I assume one of these run to my brake booster but I am not even sure
where that it is.  Any help would be appreciated.
