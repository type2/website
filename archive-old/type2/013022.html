Hey John,

I've got an 80 Westy with AC scheduled for another
rebuild (why I was trying to get a top quality crank
and rod set this time).  The AC seems to pull a lot of
power from the engine (est 15 or 20 HP) so I figure I
should try to get as high a compression ratio as is
reasonable on the rebuild.  I thought 130 to 135 psi
compression would be a reasonable compromise.  Reading
your post several questions come to mind.

If an engine is built with an 8:1 compression ratio,
does this translate into a maximum compression test
number of 117.6 psi (8.0 X 14.7 psi)?  You indicate
the loss of 15 psi in compression will not make much
difference in performance.  Any estimates on what a 15
to 30 psi loss in compression means to HP or fuel
economy?  Also as you've indicated there always are
uncertainties about the head displacement.  Does this
require one to cc the engine to really know the
compression ratio after a rebuild?

Rob

&gt; the difference between 65 and 68 hp trying to move
&gt; 2.5 tons isn't a whole
&gt; lot of difference.
