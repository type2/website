Subject: Keeping the Engine Running? (rocker arms)
Message-ID: &lt;3829EC3C.A5617378_at_falcon.cc_dot_ukans_dot_edu&gt;

Hi listers---

I finally got my poor old 74 Westfalia to run (I rebuilt the engine, got
it in, it was backfiring a lot--got enough advise from the group to get
it sputtering). But it's not really running good enough to drive (or
even idle, or, well even speed up).

So I know I have some carb adjustment to do. But before going there, I'm
concerned about my rocker arms. It seems that on some cylinders, the
rocker arm itself easily clears the valve spring, but on others, it the
curved part of the arm is touching the spring. I'm afraid this is not
letting the valve close completely.

It's a 1.8 L.  Are the rocker arm assembly specific to the cylinders? I
had seperated them out carefully, but my neighbors dog ran though the
shop and scattered them across the floor while I was putting it back
together.

Any help (and quick help if possible since I'm going out to work on it
in about an hour) would be very appreciated.

Thanks
