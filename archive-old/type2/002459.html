Subject: I need info about installing a T1 engine in place of a T4

Hello!
I have just recently rescued a 1976 westy that was in decent shape but
didn't have a engine.  I  looked around and wasn 't able to locate a T4 so I
settled on a T1 that I found cheap.  The rehabilitation of this vehicle has
gone very well until yesterday when after I installed the engine, I found
that the new starter was not engaging the flywheel.  It just seems to spin.
Has anyone else ever had this experience and maybe could give me some
advice.  Is it the wrong starter, flywheel or bellhousing?  The starter is
for a '74 transporter.  Bellhousing is 1976.  Motor is from 1974 beetle.
Any help would be much appreciated!

Thanks!
Roy
