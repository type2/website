Subject: Re: [T2] Re: air tools

Terry, is that true? I have a gauge that's on my compressor itself, and then
I have maybe a 2 foot long steel braided hose that goes to my regulator /
water seperator. On there, I set the regulator to about 90 PSI, and then I
have connected to it a 50 foot long Goodyear air hose.

I'm not saying your wrong, but I'm curious to know exactly how that could be
because the inside of the air hose is still part of the same area as the
section that is supposedly under a 90PSI load. How could the PSI at one end
of the hose be different than the PSI at the other end of the hose? Are you
saying that while I'm using the tool, the PSI decreases at the end of the
hose? But not while it's just sitting?


Thanks,

Todd

&gt; George,
&gt; I do know that if your air tools call for 90 psi. you had best crank up
&gt; that regulator, because at the end of that hose you aren't getting 90
&gt; psi.
&gt;
&gt; Not unless the hose is only 3 ft. long., or 1&quot; in diameter.
