&gt;I had a similar problem with my '69. I know that the switches are not 
&gt;exactly the same but be VERY CAREFUL.

I will repeat that!!! BE VERY CAREFUL!!!

I was moving and had made one trip to new apartment, when I tried to 
start the bus the key would not turn! wiggled it, applied some force and 
it started. I then went back to my apartment, loaded up the other 1/2 of 
my worldly possessions, tried to start again, same thing, so a little 
more wiggle, a little more force, then a click, a &quot;pop&quot; and smoke started 
to billow out of the dash!! 
As they say, time seemed to stand still! I ran around to the back, lifted
the lid and yanked off the earth with my bear hands!! 
Pictures of my bus with my stuff up in flames flashing thro' my head!

Smoke stopped :-)))))

Of course now I had to fix it and all my tools, wire etc were in the back 
under my pile
of crap! I walked to the local flaps, bought a generic ignition switch, 
wire and a few 
terminals. I sniped the wires from the back of the switch, traced them 
back to where they
where no longer charred! Spliced in the new wires, connected the new 
switch, tie-wraped
the switch to the steering column and wroom.. off I went.
Over a year later,I still haven't got around to replaced the switch! 
But I still remember that &quot;pop&quot; sound when I turned the key. 

So if your ignition switch is acting up, get it fixed!!!
