Subject: Wind Sheer

My 1978 Camper Bus can make for a white knuckle
excursion when in the Columbia Gorge.  50 mph winds
sideways?  I guess!  
     
For those who don't know, the Columbia River Gorge is
a wind-surfers Mecca, with world-class wind-age
year-around.  Not at all my cup-of-tea.  And not at
all braging rights here.  Trouble is, VW Camper
busses, which are akin to large loaves of bread
careening down the highway, readily get pushed from
lane to lane.  Even at a self-imposed 30 mph top
speed, the 50 mph side buffeting can frighten the best
of drivers.  And in such winds, Semi-Trucks get pushed
over.  And for you Oregonians out there, I bet 84 get
closed either Friday or Saturday to ALL traffic _at_ The
Dalles or Hood River...and due to not only the Wind,
but due to Snow as well.
