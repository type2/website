hmmm,

I put vanagon drivers seat in a friends 78, the drivers seat slid right
in, the passenger seat didnt... (it had the &quot;hooks&quot; setup because it had
the bulkeads, it was a kombi not a standard.

Any bus with no bulkeads behind hte seats should have tracks both sides
and they should slide rigt in. the vanagon seats were out of an 80, dunno
if they changed the tracks later, but that worked hunky-dory.

take care,

Steve
