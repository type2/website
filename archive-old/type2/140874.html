Subject: Updating Westy interior

I have a 74 Westy, which I am restoring, and have all the new sheetmetal 
done and in epoxy primer.  I was wondering how difficult it would be, and 
how feasable, to replace my &quot;weathered&quot; cabinets etc, with a newer setup 
from a 77 78 vintage one.  I like the setup better than my current one, just 
because of the newer layout.  Since Westpahlia, is an aftermarket installer, 
everything should be detachable from mine, and newer one installed.  Any 
comments would be greatly appreciated. TIA
