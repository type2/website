Hi Folks,

This thread is getting old, but I thought I'd toss in my 2 cents about the 
fuel tank reserve.

1. The reserve really is just a line on the gauge.
2. My 1979 owner's manual says that when the needle is in the reserve area, 
approximately 1 gallon of fuel is left in the tank.
3. The reserve appears to hold more than 1 gallon, since this weekend I 
ended up driving from Moab, UT to Fruita, CO on less than a quarter-tank of 
gas.  Due to excessive smoke inside my Bus, I neglected to stop at one of 
the gas stations near Moab, and ended up driving nearly 100 miles to Fruita. 
  We came into the gas station &quot;dead stick&quot;, since the engine quit at the 
offramp and we coasted from there.  Anyway, I'm either getting better gas 
mileage than I thought, or my reserve is larger than the owner's manual 
states.

So, here's my current hypothesis on the fuel reserve:
1. The reserve on my Bus indicates about 2 gallons.
2. The space between 1/4 and R indicates about 3 gallons.
3. To avoid excessive worry, fill the tank when the fuel gauge reads less 
than 1/4.

Your mileage may vary....
