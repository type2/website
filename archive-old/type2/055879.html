Subject: WTB: partition/divider 

Listees,

I am looking for '56-'60 partition/divider that is between the cab and the cargo area. My bus is a '58 deluxe and would prefer that year. I am in Northern California (San Jose). Or if anyone has any leads on a junker/donor bus that has this and matches the years please contact me.
