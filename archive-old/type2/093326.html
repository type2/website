Subject: Re: [T2] VWoA Exploitation Protection Fund

We are talking about our few thousand dollars versus VW's billions. 
Remember VW is just about the largest car maker in the world - and they 
know it.

This is not an old topic - trademark law is a well developed beast.

If you are visible via the Internet like someone else said you are an easy 
target. Use a search engine, lookup VW or Volkswagen or any number of the 
words they hold the rights to and send a letter to each and everyone that 
has broken the law or got too close to the edge.

Those that broken are compelled to concede and pay a penalty and some of 
those too close will send in a check to cover the penalty. Easy money for 
the lawyers. Would even make a good scheme. Get a PO box and chase 
trademark infringements with fake letterhead, etc. I thought that was what 
Continental was when they were first getting mentioned by the list.

Unfortunately that is modern day American law. It is not always who is 
right and wrong but who has more money.

If you want to do your VW things then you had better keep it out of the 
magazines and off the Internet. You make an easy target that way.

If you want to make T-shirts and mugs then do face to face transactions and 
no advertising but be aware they can get you if they want to and if they 
find you.

I hate to see a corporate giant sick it's dogs on us little people but it 
is hard to justify going after the retailers selling the bogus VW 
merchandise if every club or 150K people are making trinkets with VW all 
over them.
Probably some judge or lawyer that said that if you go after some of the 
violators then you have to go after all of the violators. The lawyers VW 
uses probably get paid per violator caught and thus are hungry for more.

Ciao!
