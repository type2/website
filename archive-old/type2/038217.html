&gt;&gt; When I pull the spark plug wire off of #4 it doesn't seem to affect the
&gt;&gt; engine. No noticeable drop in engine noise.
&gt;
&gt;Take the plug out of #4, attach the plug wire, hold the electrode finger to
&gt;a good ground on the motor somewhere, and have someone start the motor (in
&gt;neutral!). You should see the spark. 

Use an insulated pair of pliers, or a rubber glove inside an oven mitt to
hold the spark plug.
