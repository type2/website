I had exactly the same problem. I experienced a sensation like the engine
was hiccuping.

The solution was very simple, one of the ground wires that is almost
impossible to see under the air intake box was almost completely worn
through. It was just hanging on by a few threads. 

The problen cleared up when I corrected the bad ground condition.

I'm not saying that this is the only condition that will cause your
problem. It's just one of the hardest to detect.

I'd also check the fuel pump preasure.

Hope this helps

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; 
&gt; My 82, 2.0 FI vanagon has been having some bucking/hesatating issues 
&gt; lately. 
&gt;   It was first noticeable only when cruising in 4th and it would 
&gt; give a 
&gt; little, slight hesatation every 20mi or so.  I went on a road trip 
&gt; this 
&gt; weekend and it got conciderably worse, most noticeable going up 
&gt; hills on the 
&gt; freeway and starting to be noticeable at all gears.  After reading 
&gt; the 
&gt; archives a bit I'm suspecting the fuel filter, which seems like a 
&gt; logical 
&gt; cause to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I was hoping for some reassurance as to weither the fuel filter 
&gt; would be the 
&gt; first thing to check, or if there is another likely culprit.
&gt; 
&gt; Any words of wisdom would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you
