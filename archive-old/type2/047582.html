Subject: RE: [T2] VW Emblem

I bought a nice original emblem at Pomona for $20.  It was in a pile of
emblems.  I looked through them and got the real thick, heavy original one.
The cheap ones are easy to detect if both are there but the best way to tell
is by sheer weight.  The original are about 2 pounds where the cheepies are
feather weight (correct me if I am wrong).  By the way, does anyone out
there have some seatbelts to sell me.  I need all of them for the back of my
71 westy.  Thanks!

I've bought a few aftermarket ones from RMMW *very expensive* they were a
whole lot lighter than the originals, and they were stamped *on the side
facing out, no less* either,  China, or Taiwan.

If you come across  more of them that are in reasonably good shape, *for: 71
bus, original, or aftermarket*  Let me know, I have a buyer for them.

Btw, does any one *Nikki* have one of the rear Decklid Script &quot;Volkswagen&quot;
pieces for a 71 bus?  Please let me know, I have a buyer for two of them, as
well.

&gt; How do you tell if a VW emblem is authentic?? I got one from a junkyard
for
&gt; 20 bucks at a junkyard and it looks authentic but you never know. Are
there
&gt; any telltale signs to look for ??
