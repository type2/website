Subject: help with wiring a VDO tach
Content-Language: en

Greetings,

Picked up a VDO Cockpit tach unused in original box but without wiring or instructions. The back of the tach has 4 horizontal terminals labeled above as following:

          +   24W   12W   -

anyone know how to wire up the tach to a stock 1600 engine? Do I need to get any special diodes or senders?

thanks

Greg
