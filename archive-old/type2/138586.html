Subject: Old Key

I took a picture of my current key.  I laugh every time I see it and when I
show it to others.  I have no idea how long it's been around.  I have a 74
westy but I wouldn't think that keys generally last 30 years and ill be
replacing all the locks in the bus in the near future.  Yes it works in all
the locks on the bus. ;) Anyway I thought a few people might get a kick out
of it.  It's always good to see a bus getting used and I have the key to
prove it.
