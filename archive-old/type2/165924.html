Subject: RE: [T2] door locks

Ryan, 

Suggest you try removing the lock cylinder from the old locks and reusing
it.  I watched my mechanic do this on my '90 Jetta the other day.  That
cylinder was held in by just one nut (10mm I think).  I don't know how the
bus is, but chances are they have similar designs.

&gt; Subject: [T2] door locks
&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I am needing to replace both front door locks on my 71. My key works in
the
&gt; other locks and the ignition and I'd like to use it with the replacement
&gt; locks as well. Is it possible to rekey locks from other years to a 1971
key?
&gt; Or will I need to hunt for 71's?
