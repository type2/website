&gt;  is the the clutch cable streaching? or did my clutch just die? or is it
&gt;  new tranny time, shifting has been kinda hard recently..

Hi Tony,

My experience is that when the clutch plate fails you get less drive to the 
wheels ie the engine revs go up but the bus doent speed up. In early stages 
this can be overcome by accelerating slower.

The pedal return is controled by the spring on the lever outside of the 
transmission. If the pedal isnt returning to the normal position then the 
cable may be failing or the bowden tube (the springy tube just to the front 
of the lever on the gear box) has lost its spring so is not holding the cable 
tight.

Clutch cable stretch very little and only when new. Lengthening of an old 
cable is mearly a precursor to total failure. 

This lenthening will cause hard gear changing as pressing the clutch does not 
full disengage the drive from the gear box.

If I were you I would remove the cable and check for wear staight away.
pull it forward to the front as the clip which holds it to the pedal will 
probably break when removed and a new one should be used with a new cable.

This isn't a difficult and should only take an hour to replace. It should be 
tightened so that there is only 20mm of movement at the pedal before 
resistance is felt.

Good luck
