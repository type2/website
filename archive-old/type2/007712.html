&gt; Question 2 -- Fuel Pump?
&gt; Ok, I've purchased fuel pumps before.  But I presume to start from a
scratch
&gt; long block I also need a pump rod and a stand piece.  Anything else
to be
&gt; aware of.  ((As an aside, I'm pretty close to deciding that the stock
&gt; &quot;alternator style&quot; round fuel pump should drive my dual Kadrons.

Yes, the stock fuel pump will be more than enough to supply your dual
carbs.  Unless you're building a drag racing engine the stock setup is
fine.

When you get ready to install your alternator pump, be sure to measure
the pushrod protrusion to ensure that the pushrod length and spacer
length are correct.  If this protrusion is too short the pump flow
will be less.  If too long, the pump will be damaged.

I normally install alternator pumps anytime I change pumps,  They work
fine with generators and you never know when you might want to change
to an alternator.  As I understand it, you _can_ fit an alternator
with a generator pump, but then the pump cannot be removed without
removing the alternator, kind of like painting yourself into a corner!
