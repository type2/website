&gt; Hello folks
&gt;   I've been keeping my bus at a friends house while I was rebuilding
&gt; the engine.  Now the engine is about ready to go back into the bus,
&gt; but I need to find a way to get the bus back to my house.  So can
&gt; anyone suggest someone who would be willing to tow the bus from
&gt; Brunswick Md to Washington DC?
&gt; Thanks in advance!
&gt; --Nick

take the engine to the bus, then drive it back
