Eric,

Thanks for making me go look at my spare fuel pressure regulator.  The last one I
was working on was my Cosworth Vega, a bosch part.  Similar to a D-jet system.  My
1979 spare regulator has no adjustment as you found.  Sorry for the bad info.  If
you have to buy one though, if an earlier adjustible one is cheaper, you'd have
that adjustability.  The Cosworth adjusted up to 38 - 42 PSI, and down into the VW
range.

The 2 - 2.5 CO setting worked on a trip last weekend from sea level to 7500 feet
over the Sierras.  19 - 20 mpg average over 700 miles.

&gt; &gt; Look into the vacuum end of the pressure regulator.  See a small adjustment
&gt; &gt; screw?

&gt; Um, no.
