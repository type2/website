&gt; My starter solenoid recently self destructed.After
&gt; trying to find a
&gt; replacement for several days I have come up
&gt; empty.The problem...all the
&gt; replacement solenoids have two push on connectors on
&gt; the right side of the
&gt; solenoid.(if you hold the terminal end of the
&gt; solenoid facing you,with the
&gt; positive bolt up).Anyway mine has an extra plug on
&gt; the left side,that gets
&gt; used in my bus.

Okay, John - that extra terminal has a red/white wire
that attaches to it. Attach that wire to the big
terminal that the actual starter wire attaches to,
using a large ring-type connector to fit over that
massive terminal. I made a short adapter with a ring
terminal on one end and a spade terminal on the other
end.

The red / white is what actvates the double relay /
fuel pump while cranking. It is only live while
cranking. I found my notes.

BTW - Your new solenoid will probably last the rest of
your life. I was buying Bosche re-man starters every
13 - 14 months (12 month warranty) until one day I
told my starter / generator rebuilder about it always
being the solenoid. He reached into a box behind the
counter and handed me one. It was a two-terminal one.
It was $23.00 and the last starter service I ever did! -BaH
