Subject: Re: [T2] Techron concentrate

Isn't that interesting? This is what my local Chevron dealer told me, so I
just believed him. What a dolt. In any case, I bought a can of Wynn's fuel
system cleaner, and it is the exact same stuff, has the same 

polyetheramine or PEA in it. So Techron can wait till I find it again.

Take care,

Courtney

&gt;John, I CAN'T get Techron anymore in Canada because it's manufactured in
the

&gt;states and doesn't have childproof caps, so it's banned up here. We must
all

&gt;be kids I guess. :-)

 

Techron was on sale at Kragen so I bought a couple of bottles this weekend.
Both had child safety caps so I have to wonder if the container is different
in Canada.
