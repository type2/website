 I've heard on this list of front Vanagon seats in a bus,
but has anyone put rear seats in a bus?
 I'm thinking that it might be easier to put a later, folding seat
into the back of my 70' Kombi, then to spend the time and=20
money restoring the very ratty westy bed that I have.
 I know that the Vanagon had a much lower cargo floor
(over the engine), are they wider as well?
 Also, what Vgons received folder beds?

Jako 70' sunroof Kombi  =20
