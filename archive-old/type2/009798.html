	Charlie,
	I agree with the intention and would support the effort. Thats
what my heart says. My head says we'll need a treasurer to hold
the funds (and get a good return on 'em when they're not being used)
and with a little luck and good will we get our own little more-than-email
organization which overlaps LiMBO and AAA... which might be good
but doesn't capitalize on the strength of the list.

	And my heart then says, heck, this list works not because
it has a lot of formal structure but because it has a moderator who
takes responsibility for it and sets the rules, and we self-select
to be here and live by those rules and make friends and have our
lives changed forever blah blah blah.

	So then my head says, ok, here's two proposals:
1) As with this last effort and the Ken Hooper Christmas Present,
when a recognized need occurs, leaders will arise and we'll back 'em.
Those in trouble on the road should contact another listee, which
seems like a terrific idea. If the contactee or some other individual
(or the listee in distress if they have connection..) can organize support,
then its all for the best. I believe parts and tools and helpers have
been organized this way before, not to mention John Anderson's organizing a 
raffle to support your tour. And on a lesser but more personal note, a
dinner party brought itself to my house the day I got the engine into
our '70.

2) Maybe even better. If the strength of the list is in part because Ken
moderates, just as Gerry did in the old days, etc. then maybe we need
a SECOND volunteer position, Bus Pilot's Rescue Squad Coordinator. For
which job someone promises merely to forward cries for help, with some
attendant check cashing and money-wiring on an emergency basis. But mostly
the same info passing job any of us would do if contacted by another
listee in trouble.
	
	Oh, I know, we could get very elaborate- have an 'official'
tee shirt fund raiser, a treasurer and a stack of money at hand, a little
emergency kit of manuals and Phase 1 tools that can go out next-day-air...
sounds like mission creep.

	So its Friday and thats what I think. I've got enough of the
'brother's keeper' stuff in me to send a few bucks or some suggestions
out a couple of times a year. Maybe recipiants of this help would pass
it along, maybe not- minimum structure is a goal.

	So I'd nominate Charlie, whom I've never met in person,
as Coordinator, but I'd suggest we do tool collecting, fund raising,
etc, ad-hoc, as needed. Storing info we already do in the Archives, and
having the names of reputable shops and places where good or other
experiences were had will always help. Being there for each other seems
like the smallest thing we can do but I suspect in many ways its the
biggest. 

	If anyone's emergency happens in the Bay Area, I'm in the
phone book at William B. Abbott, Oakland, CA, 510 594 1567 evenings
and weekends, 408 451 3278 weekdays. I can relay calls for help, etc.

	Bill
