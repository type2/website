Subject: Re: [T2] I'm getting the busloops

Yep you got me there? Common quotes around my house:

&quot;Come to bed.&quot;
&quot; Are you almost done?&quot; (Uhm these two don't go together they are used at 
different times.)
&quot;I'll be done in like 15 minutes.&quot;
&quot;Is that Volkswagen minutes?&quot;



the best one:   &quot;I just have one more thing to do.&quot;
