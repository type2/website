Subject: Re: [T2] Bus tires ?

Hi Andy,

You might want to shop around for a place that can do the balancing 
**on the vehicle**. Apparently this is a new thing that some local tire 
shops hereabouts are offering. Sounds like a great deal for the 
wide-fivers out there. I haven't tried it myself, but a friend with a 
68 westy who needs new tires was telling me about it just yesterday.

Happy trails,
