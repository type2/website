Subject: RE: [T2] wheels and tires in the time of cholera.

&gt; I'm in deep smit over the fifteen inch alloy wheels Ron has
&gt; listed at Bus Depot. I think the available light truck tires
&gt; which will fit the wheels from Bus Depot are too big for
&gt; the bay wheel wells.
&gt;
&gt; I have been poking around in the type2 archives, on
&gt; thesamba_dot_com's bay forums, and gowesty_dot_com's wheel
&gt; package pages I'm tire and wheel stupid and I'm a bit
&gt; confused by some of the things I've read.
&gt;
&gt; I do not want to create a safety problem in the pursuit of
&gt; style and/or economy.
&gt;
&gt; Ideally, I'd like to know how an arrangement like GoWesty's
&gt; works on bay window buses -- their customer feedback seems
&gt; uniformly in the vanagon camp, and they have not responded
&gt; about bay window specific feedback at present.


GoWesty's 15&quot; Vanagon wheel/tire package includes standard passenger car
tires, which they claim will be fine on a Vanagon even though they are not
reinforced as Volkswagen recommends. Their argument, is that since the 15&quot;
tire has a taller sidewall it need not be reinforced. As I note on my tire
info page, &lt;http://busdepot_dot_com/busdepot/details/tires.jsp&gt;, I have a real
issue with using tires that do not meet VW specs. There are important safety
reasons why Volkswagen specified reinforced tires on busses. I think it is
beyond question that a reinforced tire should be used if you're using a
stock 14&quot; wheel. The difference in handling and safety is significant.

But would a 15&quot; tire still need to be reinforced, or is it unneccessary as
Go Westy claims? It's hard to come up with an &quot;official&quot; answer since a
'68-up Bus or Vanagon didn't have 15&quot; tires so there is no &quot;VW spec&quot; for
this. But we can somewhat deduce one by looking at other VW vans. When VW
switched to a 15&quot; tire on the early T4 (Eurovan), they continued to
recommend a reinforced tire. This was on a vehicle whose maximum GVWR was
only 575 pounds (total, not per axle) higher than the Vanagon.  So this
clearly shows that VW felt that the use of a 15&quot; tire did NOT eliminate the
need for reinforced tires, at least on a vehicle with the weight of a
Vanagon or Eurovan. This would seem to directly contradict GoWesty's claim.


But how about a Bus, which is not quite as heavy as a Vanagon? Can we get
away with passenger car tires on a '68-up bus if they're 15&quot;?  Well, let's
look backwards to the earlier Busses that had 15&quot; tires. Splitties were sold
with both 14&quot; and 15&quot; tires. In both cases, VW specified tires with the
identical ratings. They were 6-ply (which I believe is still truck-rated,
although without as strong a sidewall as the 8-ply requirement for '68-up).
But the point is BOTH the 14&quot; and 15&quot; versions required 6-ply tires. While
VW specified 4-ply tires on their cars that used 15&quot; tires, they did not on
their busses. Extrapolating this to apply to the '68-up busses, one might
conclude that if VW recommended an 8-ply tire in a 14&quot; size, there is no
reason to believe that going up to 15&quot; would result in a reduction of this
recommendation. Just as it did not on the Vanagon/Eurovan.  Another factor
to consider is that Volkswagen recommended a rear tire inflation of 40 psi.
This exceeds the maximum inflation of many 15&quot; passenger car tires.

Is this answer definitiive? No, it's merely extrapolation of the data that
we do have. But I think it makes sense, and as one who tends to err on the
side of caution, I think I'd opt for truck-rated tires even in the 15&quot; size.
I know that saying this might well cost me the sale of a set of 15&quot; alloys,
but  anyway that's my take on it.
