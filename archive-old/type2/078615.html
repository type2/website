Subject: RE: [T2] Bus depot website

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what happened to The Bus Depot's Website?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the heads-up. I just left a message with our hosting
&gt; provider.


I got a response from our provider already.  They're updating their hard
drive and operating system today.  They will have to shut the server down
intermittantly throughout the day.  So if the site is down, just try again a
little later; it shouldn't be down for long.
