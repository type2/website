Here's one for the list that has puzzled me. My bus is a kind of weekend
camper hardtop model. It has a split rear seat that folds out, one side at a
time, into a really nice bed. Behind the rear seats in the back area is an
overhead storage shelf, no door. There is storage under the rear seats with
a door that is hinged at the bottom. Behind the drivers seat is a cabinet
that has a sink. Under the sink is an oval vertical opening with a door on
it. beside and to the rear is an ice box. above the ice box is a drawer for
utensils, etc. In the floor between front seat/rear seat and the cabinet is
a recessed aluminum fitting that a pedestal mounts in for a round table. The
table stores in the oval hole in the cabinet. And up front are two captains
chairs with fold down arms and a pivoting stand. Almost the entire back area
is formica like panels including roof area. all the windows have drapes for
them too. This looks way to good a job to be a one off, however I can't find
anything on it's origin and I have never seen another like it. Does anybody
know?

TIA
