&gt; Shame really. My old lecturer, Harris Mann, at university in Birmingham 
&gt; (UK)
&gt; was the chief designer at Rover then - he was the guy behind the classics
&gt; that are TR7 and the Allegro. He showed us renders of the concepts and they
&gt; were truly good looking vehicles - it was just cost-cutting exercises that
&gt; led to them being less of a car than they could have been :( I still like
&gt; the TR7...same goes for the Fiat - very similar - not sure which one would
&gt; rust first though in English rain ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Dunk
&gt; 
&gt;    Introducing the TR7 as a fixed head coupe (only) certainly didn't do 
anything
   for its popularity, either... Tho' it was a reading of the American market
   that seemed (at the time) on the verge of legislating drop heads out of
   existence... ;-(
