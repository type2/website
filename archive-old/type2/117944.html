Subject: 79 Rattle Clips - Haiku

Hi Folks,

Now that I have new wheel bearings on all 4 wheels, my ride is quiet enough 
to hear the front brake pads rattling on bumpy roads and sometimes even on 
smooth pavement.  After pulling the wheel apart and consulting Bentley 
several times, I discovered that I seem to be missing the &quot;Rattle Clips&quot; on 
both calipers.  Lack of clips does not seem to affect braking (after 35k 
miles of testing), but it sure makes bumpy roads that much more annoying.

So, does anybody know a good source for these items?  Can they be found at 
my FLAPS as a generic item, or are they VW-specific?  If a VW part, are they 
available from one of the many mail-order places out there?  Or can they 
only be found in the dreaded land of N.L.A. (with apologies to anyone living 
near Glendale or Burbank)?

To put it another way:

Front brake pads rattling
Bentley describes missing part
Consult List for help

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions.
