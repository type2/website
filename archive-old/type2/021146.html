Big nut with 205-75R-15 4.375 R&amp;P 1.26 redux 0.82 4th
Gives us 3200 at 55 mph (sorry Jon no KM's)
These are good numbers do to lots of calibrations including GPS
17.2 mph/1000 rpm
So the real question is how fast do you want to turn your engine
P &amp; C
59 ddr w/t w 65 ez camper most of the time 48 mph at 2800 rpm when it is
above 70 degs

 
 I sorta redline the 1600 a 4000 RPM (72 MPH with standard tyres)
 18 mph/1000 rpm I read on the list.
 Correlates with the owners manual saying that 65 is cruising speed &amp;
Max
 speed.
 I have not installed the tach in the singlecab but it has a big nut
tranny,
 and 205*15 tyres. So I guess that I can probably drive at 60-65.
 
 But the question is,
 Some people say that 3500 RPM is a good Max
 I infer from the book that 4000 RPM is Max
 Others have said that 4500 RPM is Max
