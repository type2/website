Subject: found leaded gas-works great!

Howdy. Out of curiosity, I went to one of the local gas stations that still
carries 87 octane leaded gas. I'm not sure why they are still allowed to
sell it, but it is the same price as 87 unleaded, so who's complaining?
What a difference! Performance was better with leaded than with 89 octane
unleaded, and it seemed to even run quieter. The dipstick was warm to the
touch after a 15 minute freeway run (it's usually hot, but not too hot to
touch). BTW, I have a 1600 dp engine from a '72 beetle. I know that these
observations are from only one day of driving, but I hope that they
continue. Is this all in my head, or could changing from unleaded to leaded
gas make such a dramatic difference? My hair seems more full and shiny, too
(just kidding).
Thanks,
