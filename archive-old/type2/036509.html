Subject: wiring - generator

Hey all...
trying to get my friends '70 bus running...
we need to know what to do with a certain wire...
it comes off of the voltage regulator and is supposed to screw into the
generator in front of (FIF) the 2 main terminals...but there is no place
to screw it in there...
so I grounded it to the gen stand and it just started smoking...
what to do with this wire??
