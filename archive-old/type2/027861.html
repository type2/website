Subject: Re:Drop an engine, giving away a bus

In an earlier post, Mike asked
   &quot;..... I was wondering if there are any references that I should
look at before dropping the engine.  I have the bentley, muir, and
haynes manuals so I'll gives those a thorough look-through...&quot;
-You've got all the info you'll need

&quot;...The thing that I really want to know is what tools do I need!  I will 
have two floor jacks (the pump type), jack stands, wheel stands, a buncha 
your normal sockets and drivers, and I'm gonna go buy some
ratcheting box wrenches.  Is there anything else I need?&quot;
-I never needed any special tools to remove or install the engine in our 77

&quot;...I'm concerned on how high I need to lift the bus to get the engines 
out?..&quot;
-You won't need to jack up the bus at all.  Again, on our 77 I used to 
remove the rear bumper, drop the engine down, slide it off the jack onto a 
piece of thin plywood, and then roll the bus forward to uncover the engine.  
I suppose if your bus is sagging way down in the back this might not work.
