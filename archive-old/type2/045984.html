Subject: [T2] Busses by the Sea!!!!!  Thank You

To everyone who attended:

I had the best time of the summer this past weekend.  I was amazed at the
diversity of the group and how well a common bond like VW's can bring us all
together.  Thanks to everyone who helped out, and special thanks to
Carl/Karl for the wood run with me and making sure i didnt drink all that
red bull myself.  The site cleanup was outstanding, nothing but horse manure
was left in our path...  hehe  This is definately going to be an annual
event.  Dave Parsons and I hung out a little after everyone on sunday and
started thinking about next year allready.  For those who didnt attend,
theres always next year :)   I'll be posting a new section to
http://vw.illequipped_dot_com in the coming days, if any attendees would like to
foward me their photos from the weekend please send em my way and i'll post
them to the site.  I hope to see you all at Busses by the Trail.


Emmet and Traci
