Subject: FS: '64 Convertible Bug

I have a '64 Bug Convertible for sale in Denver. It has some major pan
rust, and needs a new top, interior, some body work (pretty much a
total resto).  The car has been converted to 12V and has a freshly
rebuilt 1600 Dual port motor with rebuilt dual Kadrons, and new
brakes. The motor runs great and only has about 400 break-in miles on
it. $1500 for everything or $1000 w/o the motor. Please E-mail if
interested.
TIA,
Josh
