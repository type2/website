Subject: Re: [T2] Sliding door adjustment

&gt; The sliding door on my '76 Westy doesn't close well. It wants to pop open
&gt; unless I push the back of the door and close it just right. It appears that
&gt; the locking plate (as the Bentley refers to it) on the front door jamb is too
&gt; high. I've adjusted the locking plate several times, but it doesn't work right
&gt; for long. I've read the article in the archives and in the Bentley but I'm
&gt; unclear on how to proceed. I can't tell whether I need to adjust the rear
&gt; retainer thing or the rods inside the door.
&gt; I could close the door with  one hand on my old Bus, so I know it can work
&gt; better.
&gt; Anyone fixed this that has any tips?

yes practice your german cursing but it takes some very tiny adjustments
to get it right.
