Dear List,

     I've got a 78 CA bus with a leaking front seal.  I've never pulled a 
VW engine before, although I have put one in.  I've just about convinced 
the mechanic at the transit bus company I work at to let me do the job in 
his shop by promising him we could get it out and in again in one or two 
days.  
     My question is, if money were no object (and of course it is, but 
just for the sake of knowledge!), what would you check or replace as long 
as the engine was already out?  I'd hate to discover two months from now 
I had to pull the thing again for some standard maintenance item I just 
didn't know to worry about.  

     Thank You, Brian W.
