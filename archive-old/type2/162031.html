Chris, what IS the state of the engine aside from the oil pickup?

What city are you located in?

&gt; I have been trying to consider all available options and im going  
&gt; with the AVP rebuilt longblock. im sending my core in tomorrow  
&gt; hopefully to get the ball rolling, then have my local shop swap it  
&gt; out for me.

I'm just guessing, but if the case is hosed and encouraging you to  
get the engine rebuilt I don't think you can expect a core fee back  
from AVP so why bother wasting any money/time to send it to them?
