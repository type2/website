Subject: Re: [T2] AridZona

Hi Jerry,

Let the record now stand at 2-posts FOR, one against.

I like to daydream about life amongst affordable rust-free type2s.  
Please continue to post these items.

Maybe we can just get Dan to set up a filter on his email app so they  
won't interfere with the usual Tire/Oil/ChildCot traffic.


Happy trails,

&gt; Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about  
&gt; AridZona Bus
&gt; Stuff.  Many times I have been asked to check out the Bus as it is  
&gt; somewhere
&gt; in AridZona.  I do all of this for free! I have put many buyers and  
&gt; sellers
&gt; together. If this is such a burden the  two Bus lists, then no  
&gt; problem.
&gt; What happens in AridZona will now stay in AridZona.
