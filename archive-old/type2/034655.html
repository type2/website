Subject: Electrical System Goes Bye-Bye

I certainly hope that someone can help me. Last week, my wife 
was taking our son to school when the entire electrical system 
disappeared- no lights, radio, wipers - nada. She wiggled a few 
wires and looked at the fuses, to no avail.  About 30 seconds later, 
it all came back, and she made it home. Having neither the time 
nor the inclination, I took it into the shop.(it's a 77type2). They had 
replaced the ignition switch, regulator and alternator mid 
December, so I figured that they should treat me to a free 
diagnostic, if not a full repair. They poked, prodded and otherwise 
checked things out. They could find no problems, although they did 
put in a new ignition switch just for good measure. Today, I was at 
the grocery store when the same thing haappened. This time, the 
problem did not rectify itself. I waited a reasonable time then had it 
towed home. several hours later, I went out and tried it again. To 
my amazement, it was all back again. I don't want to take it back 
to the shop, but I don't know what to try next. Any ideas would be 
great!
