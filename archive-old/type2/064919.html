Subject: Re: strange splittie dream

You know, come to think of it, I have had 3 dreams in the past 2 weeks
that I caught someone breaking in my bus.  One a stranger, one an
ex-boyfriend, and the third was 2 girls from my school.  The cool part
was that all three times, I was able to scare the person(s) away, by
coming up behind them.  Am I getting paranoid or something?  
Last night, I dreamed that my steering wheel was made of that bendy wire
that eyeglasses are made of, so they can be sat on and not broken. 
Whenever I tried to steer, my steering wheel just bent, and would not
turn.  I just got angry and had to have my boyfriend drive the me and the
bus home.  I don't know what these dreams mean, but I have been dreaming
of my bus an awful lot. Dallas

By the way, today, it is the 1 year anniversary of my bus being mine(and
my 18th birthday)!
