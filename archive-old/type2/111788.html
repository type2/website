Subject: I've Been ROBBED !!! (short story)

my bus has been driving great, so im excited and have
been just making up excuses to drive the thing..
finding places to go and do etc.

I was coming home from church tonight around a 7 mile
drive and im cruzing along around 50mph and my bus
starts cutting out, then dies. Lucky for me there was
a gas station I was able to coast into..

I was sure it was my fuel pump, turned out it wasn't
so now im thinking the gas tank was clogged.I was
blowing into the gas line hoping to remove the debris
Nothing happens.

remove the gas cap and shake the van, listening for
gas, I cant here anything, (should i be able to?) im
thinking well it would'nt hurt to try.. so i push the
van up to a gas pump, and with the gas line
disconnected from the fuel pump i slowly pump a little
gas in until BINGO gas starts coming out of the line..

this is impossible I had an empty gas tank!!!!

impossible because 100 miles ago i had a full tank..

someone has pilfered gas from my bus or my bus before
i had it fully dialed in was a monster gas guzzler..

the best came from the story, and i wasnt stranded..

peace and chicken grease,
rob
