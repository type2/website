Subject: Re: [T2] Minnesota VW swap meet???

Well, it has been firmly decided about the Twin Cities Volkswagen Club swap 
meet.  It's cancelled.  THe deal with the VW dealership in Saint Cloud fell 
through due to their remodelling and we could not find any where else.

Next on our list is where are we going to have our annual show.

frozen too!)

&gt; O.K.  After the meeting Wednesday night the only thing that was firm;y 
&gt;  decided about the Spring Swap meet is that it will be 6 April.  Where is 
&gt;  still to be determined since the plan of having it at the VW dealership in 
&gt;  Saint Cloud fell through.  We may have it at the VW dealership in 
Rochester. 
&gt;  
&gt;  Maybe.
&gt;  
&gt;  I will post when the location has been announced.
