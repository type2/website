A 76 came with the longer aluminum pushrods, solid cam, solid lifters, and
mechanical lifter valve springs.

Now you mention this was a 76 that was converted to hydraulic lifters prior
to this tear down. I wonder if all the components were changed at this time?
Are you sure the Camshaft, pushrods, lifters and valve springs were all changed?
I say this because it could've worked - with varying efficiency - without
switching all
the components. (dare we think it might be why its in the shop?)

Double check to make sure your lifters are hydraulic, check your push rods, the
hydraulic ones
are thinner and smaller than the mechanical ones, and usually a bit more
discolored after use.
Mechanical ones are thicker, longer and shinier and aluminum.

Yeah - like clark said - do you have big spacers under the cylinders, that would
 screw up the rocker arm
geometry wouldn't it? I don't know.....
