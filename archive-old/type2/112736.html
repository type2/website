Subject: main #4 bearing dowel pin loose

The dowel pin on the #4 bearing is slightly loose in it's hole.  It
looks like the #4 main bearing siezed up because it's really hard to
spin.  Does this mean the case is shot?  This is what it says in the
library:

&quot;The next area I inspect is the the main thrust bearing dowel pin hole.
I think this area is often overlooked. If the dowel pin has any movement
in the hole I trash the case. The movement means the end play was not
set correctly and the excessive end play caused the dowel pin to oval
out the hole.&quot;

The pin actually elongated the hole side to side, not forward/back.  All
3 other dowel pins are tight in their holes.  

This is from a 78 westy.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Thanks,
MIke
