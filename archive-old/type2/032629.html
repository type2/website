Subject: The Great BusTour - A life of its own!

Ok folks, here's the latest scoop, as far as *I* have it...

Somewhere along the line, after the baton was passed to Chris Huff in
Atlanta, there seemed to be a breakdown in the communication of progress to
me. Not sure what happened, it just seemed to trickle down to zero. Next
thing I know, I go to a trade show or two, get ready for another, meet two
magazine deadlines, and here we are and I have NO real idea where the darn
thing is!

After piecing together a few emails I've seen to the list, I gather the Tour
is either ready to go to, or already in, Chapel Hill, NC. If anyone can
confirm this, please let me know.

I have asked for all those that have participated thus far, particularly
those after Doc Ric and Chris Slaymaker to send me an update on their leg of
the trip so I can get the site back up to speed. I'll be working on the site
this week to get it back in shape.

If you have signed up on the site, the log should have added you. The list
of names will be the first thing to get updated tomorrow evening. So check
the site on Wednesday to see if you name is there. If it is not, please head
back to the site and re-enter on the forms. I apologize if you already have
done this, but I want to make sure everyone is included, and my pea brain
may have lost emails requesting to be added.

I did experience some problems sending the update request to a few folks.
They are as follows:

pearlgrl_at_bellsouth_dot_net
cjford_at_altamaha_dot_net
sallad_at_email.unc_dot_edu
benthin_at_prodigy_dot_net
MACENSKY_at_webtv_dot_net
imperium_at_earthlink_dot_net
waitejj_at_musc_dot_edu
cchubb_at_codegurus_dot_com

These may have been just hiccups from my mail server, but if you are one of
these folks, please email me so I can make sure I have the right info.

On the other hand, I want to send my warmest thanks for all of you who have
kept it going nevertheless. You guys are why we started this whole thing in
the first place. It truly has developed a life of its own, and it's all
because of the folks who offered to participate

So, here's the scoop: Head on over to the site
(http://www.excalibre_dot_com/bussin) and check out the archives. If you have
driven, and your input on your section of the drive isn't on the site,
please send me a little tidbit of what your experience was, and the date(s)
you participated. I'll start updating as soon as I get them.

Also, will the individual who is currently holding the TourBox (tm) please
stand up? Thank you. Now who the heck are you? And where? And who is
supposed to be next.

Please help me get both the website, and my little brain, back on track as
we get close to starting the last year of the millennium.

Thanks again to all, and let's keep the ball rollin'!

Happy Holidays, and a very Happy New Year!

Leo Soderman, Bussin'!
