This isn't even a Friday topic (no Bus content), and should really
have been asked of Ken in Pmail, but I'll put on a NetNanny (tm) hat
and address it.  Perhaps folks will learn from what I say and
ultimately reduce list bandwidth.

There are a myriad of search engines on the web that are just _made_
for answering odd questions of this sort.  I brought up my favorite
(Altavista) at:

http://www.altavista.digital_dot_com/cgi-bin/query?pg=aq&amp;what=web 

and did a search for the Boolean expresson: 

&quot;greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes&quot;

(The quotes force the engine to search for that specific expression
rather than just messages containing all the words)

It returned 20 web sites that contain the answer to the question.

Give it a try!
