Hi Tom,

&gt; Best to completely remove all the seals before painting?

Absolutely. This will make sure that when you replace the seal some day 
in the future you will find

&gt; What about the bolts that are visible on the outside of the pop-top?  
&gt; Mine
&gt; are all rusty and I'd like to replace them, though I may not.  Paint 
&gt; right
&gt; over them?  Remove them, paint, then reinstall bolts?

I painted over mine. They were just cleaned up a bit with steel wool 
beforehand.

&gt; If somebody has the comprehensive step-by-step procedure for painting 
&gt; the
&gt; pop-top in place I'd sure like to see it!

1. Mask the bus to prrotect it from drippage.
2. Open can.
3. insert brush
4. Apply paint to pop-top.
5. Repeat step 3 until paint-job is complete.
6. Paint bumpers with remainder.

;-)

Happy trails,
