Subject: RE: more oil screen 

Can someone remind me again what the DIS-advantages of having an oil screen 
are?



Hi David, how's it going? The disadvantage is restricted oil flow. I'll bet 
a lot of owners don't clean that screen regularly. It it very thin metal and 
can be a bitch to get on and off without distorting it, which leads to oil 
leaks. It's not my favorite part, but it won't hurt your engine to leave it 
on ... *unless* you don't clean it. Then it will starve your oil pump.

I absolutely don't advocate removing the screen if you don't have a filter, 
and I don't advocate removing it if you don't like the idea ;-)
