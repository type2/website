Subject: Cincy Show Still ON??

Hey Folks,
Anyone know if the VW - Porsche Family Reunion Show In Cincinnati this weekend is still on??  I have been trying to access the web site for this event for the past couple of days, and it says the site is not available.  Anyone have info???  It was (is?) scheduled for Sunday, September 23, at GE Park. Thanks!
