Subject: Westfalia camper

Hi all,

     I want to thank all the people who responded to my questions about
Westfalia campers.  I just looked at &amp; will be buying a 76 Standard Westy.
All the equipment seems to be there &amp; in good shape.  It is going to need a
little body &amp; engine work but the interior is awesome.  Brand new canvas
with the three windows.  All the beds, curtains, &amp; cabinets are there.  I
will be going to pick it up tomorrow.  I will post some pictures on my web
page as soon as possible.  I am so excited.
