Subject: Quick Book Review

Hi all!
  I just went to pick up my copy of the new James Hale book &quot;How to Modify 
Volkswagen Bus Suspension, Brakes and Chassis for High Performance&quot; and 
read/skimmed much of it while at my local Barnes and Noble.  It seemed like 
it had a lot of practical, and seemingly expensive, tips and procedures for 
split busses, but not as much for the later bays.  Most of the book was on 
lowering, upgrading to ball joints and disks in the front, and upgrading to 
IRS rear ends.  There was some on hydraulic and air suspensions too.  
Thinking back, I don't seem to recall anything about tire selection, but I 
may have just missed that section.  In the end I decided not to buy the 
book, as I have a '78 Westy, already with ball joints, disks, and an IRS 
rear end.  The only information I was interested in was the sway bar 
section, but it wasn't as in-depth as I had hoped.  I guess I was just 
looking for a magic bullet, maybe hoping James Hale had discovered some 
secret to great bus handling that the rest of us didn't know about yet.  
Lots of good practical information, especially for splits, but no magic 
bullets.

Later all!
