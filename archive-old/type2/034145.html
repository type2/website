Subject: Engine pull

Hi Terry:

Engine pull methods is kinda like discussing religion, so I'm gonna testify.

What you need to do here is to drop the engine and transmission package
down together enough so that the fan housing will clear the rear apron so
that you can pull it off the tranny.  To do this, you need first support
the tranny with a jack or something.  Then disconnect the shift linkage at
the front of the tranny (1 set screw); remove the front tranny mount, then
remove the rear tranny mounts.  Drop the engine/tranny package down
together just enough to pull the engine off the tranny without the fan
housing hitting the rear apron.  Jack the tranny back up and put the rear
tranny mount bolts back in finger tight to hold the tranny up until you are
ready to reinstall the engine.  Reinstall, is of course, the opposite
procedure.

You don't need to completely pull the tranny, or even disconnect the CVs.
Dropping the tranny halfway sounds like an added level of complexity, but
it really is pretty easy if you've got another floor jack.
