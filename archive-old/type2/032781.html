Automotion sells 'em...  Bugpack repackages 'em...  Figure on spending nearly $100

&gt; With all this talk of leaking VC and bails with no tension left etc, has anyone
&gt; found a source for the cast valve covers that bolt on...?
&gt;
&gt; I have put many sets of these on Type I engines and they work very well...
&gt;
&gt; Is there any vendor out there making/selling them for the Type IV engines...??
