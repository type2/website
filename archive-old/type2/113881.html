This was a concern for me too.  I tried to make sure mine did not hang down below the top of the windshield so that it wouldn't obstruct my view.  Because of the curvature of the windshield, it does block a bit of sky in the very center of the windshield, but not enough to really bother me, and to me a very good tradeoff for what I got in return.
