Subject: Jay Leno fights California smog revision

Richard Atwell has previously posted on a move afoot in California to 
eliminate the 30-year limit on smog testing, beginning with 1976 model 
year vehicles. As Peregrine is a '76, I am following this with 
interest.

This morning's Los Angeles Times has an article about Jay Leno's 
opposition to the revision in the smog law. The article notes the 
relationship between Leno and California's governor, whose name I can't 
recall. Terminator something ...

The article, &quot;Revving Up Against Car Bill,&quot; is on today's LA Times 
webpage (which may require registration):
