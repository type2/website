Subject: Newfoundland Trip

Got back home last evening after completing our trip to Newfoundland.
The scenery is just amazing. Landed in Port Aux Basques and toured the
Island to St Johns and back. Meet many friendly, interesting and helpful
people along the way. Newfoundland is a very special place. Camping in
Gros Morne Park is a real treat. To any of you who may be wondering
where to go for a complete change of pace on your next vacation. Take a
trip to Newfoundland. You'll be glad you did.
We put 6598 kms on our 82 Westy, with no problems to report. Damn good
machines, right?
Things to remember....There are lots of hills on the Island and you
always seem to be pushing a headwind. Don't be in a hurry. Its cool in
Newfoundland at this time of year and the VW seemed to like that. Dip
stick was always touchable. (We are guage-less).
Thanks to all those list members who replied to our queary, before we
left on this trip. The information which you supplied was a big plus on
the trip.
