Subject: Re: [T2] Long (dong silver) Mirror 

From: &quot;Karl&quot; &lt;aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; There are 2 different long mirrors:

Well, with a VIN of 227___, my bay should be packing a #211 857 501J mirror
(&quot;... used... on USA models 211-274&quot;).

But the only number actually on the mirror is on the back of the mirror
housing, I[e1]10009...?  It's one with the day/night glare feature.

Karl, what is the length of the mounting shaft (stem) on the long mirrors,
and for the most part, in appearance do they look just like the short ones
only longer?  If it's simply a longer version of the short one that I have
now, I can sculpt the longer length into the reproduction.  (For that
matter, I could add a small plate for double-sided tape mounting a digital
clock!)

Since I intend to mount the reproduction in my bus, I'll probably go with
the existing bayonet-style mounting feature.  I'm not sure that I understood
the differences between the way the two long versions mount.  If push comes
to shove, I can always sculpt screw mounting points on the shaft &quot;base&quot; to
mount it on the roof (&quot;header&quot;?).

Thanks for the mirror data.
