&gt;  First I thought, new clutch cable.  Then I thought I might have to
&gt;remove the engine because the clutch cable was intact.  Now it's back to
&gt;new clutch cable.
&gt;
&gt;Well, I'm happy 'cause that's cheap :)

(relatively), easy 20-minute job with no unpleasant surprises!  Wow!  Why
can't they all be like that?
