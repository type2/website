Howdy All,
It's official, my wife is going to kill me.  I bought another bus!  A 73 Westy.  My questiion is this :  I have a 75 Westy with good top, canvas and interrior but bad engine, the 73 I just bought has great engine ,sucky top &amp; canvas.  The 75 pop-top pops up with the front of top toward the cab going up, the 73 pops up opposite, when popped up the the front of the top is lower than the back.  So I want to put the 75 top on the 73 Westy.  Anyone done this?? Is it possible?  What problems might I face?  Will I ever get a brain??



Peace, John Baker
