Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Line cutoff alternative

NOS makes fuel solenoids for their nitrous kits.  These are rated for very 
high flow, as they are designed for high horsepower V-8's.  They are pricey 
though.  I believe you can find them at Summit Racing as well as other speed 
shops.

&gt;Got the catalog here.  did a search for gasoline and only find the FL206
&gt;as suitable for gasoline.  The local supplier also could only find that
&gt;one for gasoline.  All other &quot;gas&quot; valves in their catalog are natural
&gt;gas or propane.
&gt;thanks

&gt;&gt;Indeed I sent the wrong information. The FL-219 is a normally closed,
&gt;&gt;12 VDC 1/4&quot; fitting valve.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I can send a .pdf copy of their catalog on request. It is 1151 KB.
