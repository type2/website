Greetings,

I just got an MSD 6A ignition box for my other woman, er, car. I WOULD
like to try it out in my '78 Van with fuel injection to see if it
helps it out any.  Has anybody done this here? 

My 1 question (for now that is) is can I just wire the MSD white 
wire in ith the points wire and tie in the fuel injection trigger
wire?

Thanks!

Mark
