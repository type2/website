Paul,

The interference is with the accelerator pump linkage.  On alternator equipped
upright engines the linkage is below the throttle shaft whereas on a generator
equipped engine it is above the throttle shaft.  The parts were available from
your local VW dealer last time I checked.  (Note: you WILL have to find a
knowledgeable counterperson.  Most say, &quot;Nope, can't get that kinda stuff.&quot;)
Or you can get out your die grinder and clearance the alternator...
