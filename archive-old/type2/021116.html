Oval, list:
Good letter, but keep in mind that in addition to the regular parts, Ron, about
twice a year goes back to the Vaterland and finds stocks of long discontinued
parts which are available NOWHERE  ELSE IN  THE US! This is a REALLY BIG DEAL
on such stuff as heat exchangers and rubber gaskets where replacement ones
don't really fit AT ALL.
We are so lucky on this list to have Aircooled_dot_net with John, Busboys, and Bus
Depot with Ron, and VanAgain with Ken (though Ken rarely posts to type2_dot_com). I
hope I've not left anyone out. These guys really know their stuff and are a
tremendous asset to us all, even old timers like myself.
