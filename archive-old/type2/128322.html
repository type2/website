Subject: re: [T2] how to clean up used fridge/sink

It is totally appropriate to disinfect with bleach, but not clorox.  Be
sure to buy a bleach that has no perfumes or anything else in it.  Check
the label, be sure it says sodium hypochlorite, nothing else save water.

After filling the sink, fridge, put a few drops of bleach in it.  Or, make
your cleaning solution in a bucket with water and a few drops of bleach.

The chlorine in the bleach will all evaporate away after just one night. 
It leaves just a little bit of salt, so little you won't taste it after a
thorough rinsing.

This is disinfecting and it is usually necessary a few times a year.

Regards,

Mark

was given a sink last night for my bus out of a westfalia

i am not sure how long it has sit or what not....
wanted to know the best way to clean it out in case the jug on the back is
like
yuck in there....?
i know i can run hot water through there and dump it out before install
but what
would be the safest way to clean it out/sanitize it... before use for
camping this
weekend...?

i dont want to use clorox or nothing afraid it may leave a trace of it
behind in the
water tank....
the fridge i can clean up pretty east but the inside of the water jug i
want to make
sure and eliminate any nasty that may be lurking behind.. ?
the tank it's self looks very clean and doesnt have a stinch to it but yet
i dont
want to chance it until it is sanitized....
thanks
peace and love
chris
