I, more than possibly anyone on this list, would GLADLY pay for some
great info on CD.  Depending on the volume, I would consider letting
you use some of my webspace for it, as well...for all to use...

&gt; Because of the my suggestion that I wanted to see if people think it
&gt; is OK
&gt; to get CD-ROM or ZIP copies of the archives...
&gt; 
&gt; Ken Hooper, one of the Type2 admins,  has told me to take down my archives
&gt; of the Type2 list.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't fully understand his reasons, but I understand what he is asking.
&gt; So I will be taking down the archives.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm glad all my hard work was a waste of time.  Including my discussions
&gt; with Ken.
