Subject: Muffler Needed -- What Now?

Howdy All --
Well, I've been listening to my 79 bus get louder and louder out the back
end, and I'm realizing (and have been told) that I'm in need of a new
muffler.  (As far as I know, that's all that I need but am not sure.)  With
any other vehicle, I'd probably think &quot;Midas&quot; first, but I know that I
can't think within that paradigm as a bus owner.  Basically, what is the
best route to take in terms of replacing my muffler (and any other exhaust
components that may need help)?  I definitely have neither the exhaust
system knowledge nor the tools (pullers, etc.) to pull this job off myself,
but I do know that a muffler install featuring clamping rather than welding
(a la Midas) is the way to go.  So, in general, is this something that my
trusted (really) German shop should be able to acquire and take care of, or
am I gonna have to find the component(s) through mail order, junkyard or
other means and then get someone to put it on right?  I have a 79, so I'm
kinda concerned about hard-to-find pieces.  Any advice, past experiences or
any other contributions are welcome and appreciated.
