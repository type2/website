Sean:

You're right.  Sorry, I forgot to mention I have 15&quot; rims for my bus.  However, for busses with 14&quot; rims, Yokohama makes a model called the Avid S/T in 215/70-14.  This is also a great tire.  I've been told that 215's would fit on a bus.  Also, the bead, or lip, on Yokohama's are a little different than on most brands, so this helps when fitting a wide tire on a 5.5&quot; rim.  I put a 235 Yokohama on my Jeep, which came with 215's, and they worked fine.
