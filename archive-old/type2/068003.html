Subject: 34 PICT3 sources and prices?

        Could never get my 71 camper to pass the SMOG II test so I have
        NON-OPed for a while.

        Tried re-jetting and lowering the float level, but the 2500 rpm
        CO just got worst.

        Really don't want to buy a new carb unless I know that it will
        definitly fix the problem.

*       What is a good price for a new one. Saw $159 in JCWhipme, and
        an Repair shop quoted me $169 + tax here in CA.

        Oh yea, found out that my CO will pass in DENVER (8.5 allowed),
        anyone there want a bus? (just kidding, I am not selling, but my
        home state is pissing me off!!!)
