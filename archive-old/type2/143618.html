Subject: HIGH IDLE PROBLEM

I TOOK MY 79 BUS ON A 30 MIN TRIP. THE TRIP CONSISTED ON A AVERAGE 65 MPH 
DRIVE. I ENCOUNTERED A BIG HILL THAT TOOK ABOUT 2 MIN TO PASS. THE HILL WAS EVEN 
HARDER ON THE WAY BACK HOME. ON THE WAY BACK HOME MY SPEED DROPPED TO ABOUT 40 
BUT I STILL GOT OVER THE HILL. I NOTICED THAT MY CAR WAS IDLING VERY HIGH. 
WHICH IS VERY WEIRD BECAUSE I JUST GOT IT TUNED UP LAST WEEK. IT ALSO IS 
SHAKING. IM NOT SURE WHATS WRONG WITH IT. BUT I KNOW FOR SURE I DONT WANT TO GO PAY 
ANOTHER 170 BUCKS FOR ANOTHER TUNE UP IF ITS GONNA LEAD ME HERE AGAIN. I THINK 
IT MIGHT BE THE THERMASTATE BUT IM NOT A MACHANIC. I LOOKED AT IT AND ITS TORN 
BUT LIKE I SAID IM NOT A MACHANIC. 
                                                                            
THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS,
                                                        DAVID
