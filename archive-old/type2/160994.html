I had a similar problem with my '75 a few weeks ago, only discovered it 
after
replacing the switch.  The tang on the lock cylinder that activates the
switch was too worn to engage properly .. after 30 years. :-)

But it's only held onto the rest of the lock with a rollpin.  I got 
another lock from
a junkyard Golf, swapped it's tang onto my lock, been good to go ever 
since.
The '75-up switch and lock is essentially the same as was used in most 
of the
watercooled VWs through the 1980s and into the '90s, makes finding 
parts easy.
