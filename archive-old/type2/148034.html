Subject: Re: [T2] New Battery Tray

There was a discussion on this a few months ago. Now that the archives
are updated, maybe you can find the original thread. As I recall,
seems there are some modern materials that are professionally correct
repairs.

I've gotten zero takers on some of my questions when knowledge was
very esoteric.
