I do not trust the filed &quot;v's&quot; on my pulley and the paint marks are gone.
Can someone tell me how I'd go about finding TDC assuming the pulley has NO
markings on it whatsoever.  I want to find tdc and file a notch at zero,
then file another at 7.5btdc.  If any of the current notches are correct,
I'll mark them such that I can't lose track of 'em this time.
This request may sound strange, but when I use the notch I think I'm
supposed to, placed at 7.5btdc, I get a sort of a miss at idle.  Not a pop
or backfire or anything, just a low muffled tone that sounds like the bass
from a distant car stereo or like Mr. Darlin playing a low toned jug for you
Andy Griffith fans. The sound disappears when I set that notch to &quot;0&quot; or
past, but I don't think that notch belongs on &quot;0&quot; and I dont want to be
advanced and run hot.
Lets pretend there isn't a single mark anywhere on the pulley-never filed,
never painted.  Now how to time this beast and mark it for next time.

PS: My 77 has a pertronix and was built as an otherwise bone-stock
78(hydraulicized).  I notice the static timing light doesn't work with elec
ignition--stays on all the time--but I have a stroby too.
Thanks for your expert advice.
