Drove it for a while to warm it up (and incidentally pick up the next
case of oil).  No sign of fresh leakage, so I'm pretty sure that the
sending unit was the problem.  Of course, it was a slow enough leak
that I may not have worked it enough to really find out.  We'll see
what it looks like next weekend.

This oil change (~300 miles on the engine) was a little distressing.
Last time, it looked like a red beer, or perhaps Coca-Cola.  This
time, it most closely resembled Sheaf Stout:  brown, almost black, and
completely opaque.  This is what I expect after 3000+ miles.  I'm
definitely seeing a progression here, which presumably means the
breakin is happening.  My concern is what colour comes next....

I'm doing my breakin with 40 weight Mobil, because I'm going through
it quick and that's the cheapest oil I could find easily on a Sunday.
I just started the second case (i.e., used a half-quart from it),
which means I'm on my fifth load of oil.  I fully expect to go through
this case in two or three weeks.  It's about time to figure out where
to take large quantities of oil for recycling....

I'm noticing that every time I adjust the valves, the engine seems
stronger.  This makes a certain amount of sense, as the valve
clearance opens up quite a bit each time (which means the valves are
staying closed longer, and thus the engine is fighting itself).  The
rate of opening up seems to be decreasing.  This feels strange,
because I'm used to the clearance closing up slowly, not opening
quickly.  However, it does mean I have a good indicator of when to
check them -- when it starts to stumble coming off of idle and not
want to accelerate until it's revved up a bit, the time has come.

Still running hot, so I need to play with the timing soon.
Realistically, it's probably the carb, but I understand how to deal
with timing much more, so I want to exhaust that avenue first.
