Subject: steering wheel adjustment

ok,

I read the posts this morning about the &quot;steering wheel&quot;
alignment.

But! this is the part that always gets me about &quot;our&quot; replies
to such questions...ya have someone here(including maybe me) who
doesn't know if their steering wheel was ever taken off and put back on 
incorrectly.

So, what is the correct &quot;factory&quot; procedure for putting the steering wheel 
on correctly?

Let's say that your front end is aligned as per factory specs...do you 
drive it and stop in a straight ahead position and then unbolt and rotate 
the steering wheel till it is at the 9 and 3 oclock position?

or what?

My bus steering wheel was carefully marked(by me) when removing for 
restoration....but it is *not* at the 9 and 3 position when driving 
straight down the road...not off too much, but some....and it was that way
when I marked it the first time too.

Inquiring minds want to know!&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave
