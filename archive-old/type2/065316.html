I'm not a VW guru -- far from it! -- but I am taking a VW maintenance class
from one, a factory-trained mechanic who's been working on VW's for 35 years.

*He* says: the 009 is strictly a racing distributor, St. Muir
notwithstanding. It has a terrible advance curve for everyday driving. *He*
says, stick with the stock distributor, which I think in your case is the
centrifugal/vacuum advance, which *he* calls &quot;the best distributor VW ever
made.&quot;

So -- it's second hand advice, but I trust the source, a thoughtful, honest guy.

Good luck,

Steve Tokar '71 (w/stock distributor)
