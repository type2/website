Subject: Re: [T2] headlight switches

&gt; Any experts on headlight switches out there? I'm trying to figure out what models make use of the extra
terminals, 58L and 58R:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't tell you what model bus uses 58L &amp; R, but I can tell you what the circuit is:

All German cars use the DIN Standard 72 552
I will just list the ones most VW's use:

1 = Ignition coil, ignition distributor, low voltage
4 = Ignition coil, ignition distributor, high voltage
15 = Switched + downstream of battery
        (output of ignition switch)
30 = Battery +
31 = Battery -
31b = Return to negative or ground, via switch or relay

Turn signal flasher
49 = Input
49a = Output

Starter
50 = Starter control (solenoid)

Wiper motor
53 = Input B +
53a = Wiper +, self-parking switch-off
53b = Wiper (shunt winding)

56 = Headlamp
56a = High beam, high-beam indicator lamp
56b = Low beam
56d = Headlamp-flasher contact

57 = Side-marker lamp
57a = Parking lamp
57L = Parking lamp left
57R = Parking lamp right

58 = Side-marker lamps, tail lamps, license-plate lamps, and instrument panel lamps
58d = Varible-intensityinstrument panel lamp, tail-lamp and side-marker lamp
58L = License-plate lamp, left
58R = License-plare lamp, right

61 = Alternator charge indicator lamp

Switching Relay
85 = Output, actuator (end of winding to ground or negative) Input, actuator
86 = Start of winding
86a = Start of winding or 1st winding
86b = Winding tap or 2nd winding

Relay contact for break and changeover contacts
87 = Input
87a = 1st output (break side)
87b = 2nd output
87c = 3rd output
87 z = 1st input
87 y = 2nd input
87x = 3rd input

Relay contact for make contact
88 = Input

Relay contact make and changeover contacts (make side)
88a = 1st output
88b = 2nd output
88c = 3rd output

Relay contact for make contact
88z = 1st input
88y = 2nd input
88x = 3rd input
