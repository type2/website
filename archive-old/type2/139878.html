&gt; I think the trend got started during the recession in the early 80s
&gt; when interest rates soared and EVERYONE started cutting inventories and
&gt; switched over to &quot;Just-In-Time&quot; manufacturing processes. That in turn
&gt; killed the railways and flooded the interstates with 53'
&gt; tractor-trailers and it cut the time required to get a new model to
&gt; market.

except that the railroads have made just in time possible and are running
at record load levels,  many railroads are turning down business they have
so much,  Containers have made this all possible.  heck the company you
would think of when it comes to trucks UPS, has their own unit trains
running across the continent in record times.

&gt; railways have already pulled up the track and sold their excess rolling

they have &quot;rationalized&quot; and while some track has been pulled up, they
have also probably laid more new rail than at any time in the last 100
years.  not to mention the current size of trains, engine are being built
in the 7,000-8,000 HP each versions and the builders have long backlogs of
orders.

&gt; stock, so they couldn't take up the slack even if we wanted them to.

the problem isn't RR capacity or highway capacity per se, but rather the
total volumnes being moved have exploded,  much of it domestic production
being sent to the far east, which then has to be brought back.  just like
the starter motors in my thread.  it came from Bus Depot in PA, don't know
where he got it from and they probably got it from a rebuilder somewhere
else which got the core from someone who got it in exchange etc etc etc.
this thing has probably been all over the USA and maybe other countries
in the past I would have hauled my old one to the local rebuilder and then
got it back...  and Ron is always running all over the world looking for
parts and shipping em to the woods of PA.  and were just talking about old
buses but even as individuals we use the internet to find parts that we
would never have found in the past, I've hauled parts up and down the East
coast for other bus folk and they have hauled stuff for me. and I've
gotten parts privately from all over, my gas heater came from Canada. and
have shipped parts all over. so we are part of the crowd on the roads and
rails.

&gt; departments probably loved that model. AFAIK, no-one else has even come
&gt; close to this in the automotive sector other than fleet trucks. And
&gt; even that is just a guess.

not even fleet trucks or Railroad engines,  transit buses come close with
few changes year to year with major model changes about every 20 years or
so.   (we are in the midst of a major change over to the low floor bus
design but this is the first model change since the ADB design in the
early 80's)

&gt; This is a situation where freedom of choice gets twisted by the free
&gt; market into gross excess. $160 for a PCV valve is insane, but that's
&gt; just my opinion.

but a major part of that is the fact that cars are cleaner, and safer
today. our buses really are dirty unsafe vehicles by todays' standard.
highway death and injury rates are coming down year by year even though
total miles driven are going up.  anti lock brakes, traction control, air
bags, crumple zones etc are all a major factor.

&gt; Here's the link back to Chris's post: Driving an obsoleted vehicle
&gt; means not taking part in the new game.

or maybe it is part of the retro movement, (well I've had the same VW Bus
for almost 15 years now so I don't know what that says)

tried to keep it on topic but that's what happens when you wake up a
transportation engineer.

drive safe, be happy
Bob
