I forget which one it is and I'm not near where I can look.  As I recall,
you can modify a more commonly available relay.  Here's what I wrote,
courtesy of the archive:

-------------------
The 4-pin 411-941-583C relay is no longer available (at
least locally)  Web searches revealed only one source, a Porsche supplier.

Luckily, I have a fairly savvy parts guy and he pulled out a 111-941-583
5-pin relay to compare.  The extra pin (#30) is supposed to be attached to
a hot wire to energize the relay coil.  In the old relay the coil  was
attached internally to pin 56 which
is the voltage source supplied from the headlight switch.

Apparently, the idea of the 5-pin relay was to allow the beams to be
switched with the
headlights off by supplying the relay with power from the ignition
circuit.

I soldered a jumper between the #30 and #56 pins and plugged the relay in.
There was a hole in the fuse block to accept the #30 pin, but no connector
inside the hole.  The modified relay worked perfectly.
-----------------

Before installing the new relay, drill a small hole through the top of its
case.  If water gets in, this hole will let it drain out, saving the
relay.

Hope this helps you out.

&gt; ok,
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for all the suggestions people have made about the highbeam 
&gt; switch on my bus - the consensus is that it's probably the relay, not 
&gt; the switch itself.
&gt; 
&gt; According to Bentley, &quot;The dimmer relay is the larger of the two 
&gt; cube-shaped relays on the back of the fuse box.&quot; Problem is, there 
&gt; are three relays on my fuse box, and they're all cube shaped. one is 
&gt; small, so that's out, but the other two are the same size, different 
&gt; styles. the three are spread evenly across the bottom of the fusebox, 
&gt; with the two big ones on the right and middle.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone know which one it is? i'm inclined to think that it might be 
&gt; the middle one, since that's directly below the two high beam fuses, 
&gt; but i can't see how things are connected inside, so that's just a 
&gt; guess.
&gt; 
&gt; also, does anyone have a working relay they'd sell me? bus depot 
&gt; can't find them, and i've only seen them for 68-69 buses on other 
&gt; catalogs.
