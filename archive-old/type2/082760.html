Subject: easy question

ok simply multi-national question.

Where will i get cheeper and better quality parts for
my type 2. It is currently in South Africa, i intend
to bring it back to the uk. should i get any any parts
i need out there or should i wait till i get it home.
i will get all manal labour done there as it is much
cheeper. Also should i have any problems with
emmisions restrictions in the uk.
