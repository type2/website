Subject: RE: [T2] Re: Seat belts for kids in a bus

&gt; playing out when you slam on the brakes.  Problem is, if you pull the=20
&gt; belt out gently, the belt just comes sliding right out of the=20
&gt; top reel,=20
&gt; and your kid seat never really gets tight.  This is my=20
&gt; experience, anyway.

Exactly, and the child seat can work it's way loose.  Most (if not
all) child safety seats come with a metal bracket (shaped
sorta like [-] ) that is supposed to be used to hold the shoulder
belt tight by clamping it to the lap belt.  Problem is that these =
brackets
are a pain to install correctly and many people just omit them.  I much
prefer a lap belt when installing the car seat.

That being said, my 5-year-old daughter uses a booster seat and I
don't like not having a shoulder belt in the back seats of my 79.  =
Anyone
have any suggestions as to configuring a shoulder belt for the
rear seats?  Maybe I can get a child-size Simpson 5 point racing harness
to fit in there ;-)
