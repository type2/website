You could ask Terry if he still has some.

I bought one of them for my '70.  It's a Kat's.  Look on ePay for one.

How many busses here have block heaters?  My 58 bug had one, my 77 bus
does not.  It still starts without one even when it's cold.  I've been
thinking of how I could clamp a heater onto the block.

Luckily, my gas heater is still working, although I do need to give it
a tuneup.  I should probably do that before it gets cold outside...
