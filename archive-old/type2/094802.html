Subject: Driving a Hi-top Bus

I have a 1972 camper pop-top with a 1600dp and a 1979 Deluxe Westy Interior. 
  We are winding down a 5 month trip throughout the US.  In order to get 
more interior room and interior storage I am considering converting it to a 
hi-top if I can find a top from an old bus.

The questions I have would be what would I give up?

1) I get 22 mpg with my 1600, would the mileage go down?

2) Would it get blown around more in windy conditions?

3) Which hi-top is nicest.  I liked the look of the sundial.   Can you sleep 
up top with any of the hi-tops?

4) Would it be hard to attached a hi-top?  Removing the old top is easy 
since I have done that once already when I replaced the canvas.


Thanks in advance for any comments/suggestions you may have.

- John &amp; Janet
72 Westy w/1600
