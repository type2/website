&gt; Greetings from Mesa, Arizona.  We are the proud new (but VERY old) owners of
&gt; an '82 Westfalia camper.  Bought it yesterday and will have pics available
&gt; soon.  We have named it &quot;Lucky Seven,&quot; since this is our 7th Volkswagen
&gt; Camper.  It's been awhile since our last one, so we feel like we're starting
&gt; all over when it comes to finding all of the stuff we need to make it look
&gt; like new.  I'm sure we will have lots of questions within the next few months,
&gt; and it looks like we might have come to the right place for some of the

Welcome to our little community.  Lots of helpful folks here.

Since you have a Vanagon, you might want to check out the Vanagon list at

http://www.vanagon_dot_com/links/lists.html

The Type2 list is mostly about baywindow buses, but your bus shares quite
a bit of engineering with ours and several folks here own one of each.
