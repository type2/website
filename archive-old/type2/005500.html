&gt; Uh Chuck, I agree with you, I was replying to that comment, note the RE on
&gt; the subject line there. Note my conclusion that whatever you do to your VW
&gt; to make it usable is OK with me :-)
&gt;
Jeff Tickner,

Doh! What a dumb-bass I am.... Thanks for the non-tense reply.

I sounded much more ticked that I really was. I was just trying to make it
make sense to other folks.

And after all, the original author was correct. If it butters your biscuits,
do it. In his case, his biscuits are fully buttered already. I can see why
no A/C makes a whole lot more sense on an air-cooled bus than having one
does. But I like a little gravy on mine as well.

I just wish I lived in a nicer, more hospitable place. Like General Sherman
said (before he was a General, by the way),

&quot;If I owned both  Hell and Texas, I would rent out Texas and live in Hell.&quot;

Chuck
