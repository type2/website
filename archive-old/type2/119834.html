Subject: Where to find an Alternator Upgrade?

Ok all...I have decided to go and replace my burned
out generator with an alternator, and I appreciate all
the helpful advice from the last time I posted.  Now
my question, I noticed that Bus Depot has an Altrnator
upgrade kit.  Does anyone have any experience with
said kit?  Or does anyone have a better place to find
such a thing?  Once, again any advice you have to
offer would be greatly appreciated.  Have a great
Thanksgiving y'all.

=====
Peace, Love, &amp; Happiness!!!
