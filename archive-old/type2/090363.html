Subject: Missing- carb problem?

Please help, volksfolks.  I'm just now getting
around to a problem that developed a few weeks
ago.  (Haven't driven the bus)  

74 bus with dual solexes.  On advice of a
listmember that shall remain
nameless, I misdirected some of the hoses.  I
plugged the breather hose (positive pressure at
idle) into the port on the top of the left carb,
the port between the two adjusting screws.  That
port has vacuum at idle.  Made carb run real
funny.  Ran it probably 15 miles, before I got to
a convenient pull off on the interstate and
removed the hose.  

Bus is still running funny.  Left cylinders don't
appear to be firing.   I can pull those plugs
wires and no change in the engine.  All plugs
getting spark.  I will confirm timing and dwell
in a moment, but I doubt that could have been
affected by my misrouting the hoses.  Changed
plugs.  Compression 120 all the way around.  I
didn't mess with anything else so far.  

I suspect I screwed up something on the left
carb.  What should I check?  I'm sooooo stupid
with regards to carbs (or FI).

Thanks in advance.
