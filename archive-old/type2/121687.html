&gt;All this talk about lifters has me wondering why, when one of my lifters 
&gt;bled down, no amount of driving or idling or revving would pump it back 
&gt;up.  As a matter of fact, the warmer the engine got, the more the engine 
&gt;started popping as if it was backfiring back up through the intake.  That 
&gt;noise did not dissappear until I removed and bled the lifter.  Is that the 
&gt;sign of a more serious (or different) problem?  Greg

I believe the theory is that the air trapped in the lifter expands when it heats up and keeps the valves from closing completely.

Lifters bleed down sometimes; I don't think it's a hint of a more serious problem.
