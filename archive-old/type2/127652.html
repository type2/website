Subject: RE: [T2] Type 4 oil sender, what is best??

not really sure chuck but all this talk of shaving nuts has me scared lol
no seriously i am not sure cause he did the drilling and brought the plate to me and i just bolted it up. he went by the instructions but now if he tweeked the instructions a bit i dont know? it works though and works good. i dont think i can answer this question but i am sure he will be back in town after the fourth and is a member here on the list so might have a response for that.?
peace have a great fourth everyone

This photo shows the sender mounted what I'd call perpendicular to the 
sump plate mounting screws. That is... if the mounting screws are at 
12 and 6 o'clock, the sender is at 3 (or 9) o' clock. The 
instructional diagram that came with my VDO sender suggested that I 
drill a hole at somewhere near 1:30 (exact measurements in millimeter 
were provided). Would my having drilled the hole according to the 
instructions allow me to avoid &quot;shaving a nut?&quot;
