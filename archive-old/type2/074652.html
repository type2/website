Subject: RE: [T2] Preasure Plate New $35.00

&gt; This is a new German made Sachs clutch pressure plate to fit a Volkswagen
&gt; Van it is in the original box.
&gt; Perfect condition still bright and shiny, see pic at
&gt; http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/stanvan/sachs.jpgit will be found
&gt; under drive parts.
&gt; 215 mm, 1800 bus 74-75 year. Vanagon 1900 Early 83.
&gt; Sachs part number is 3082-066-131
&gt; VW part number is 022-141-025-A
&gt; I bought it on E-bay and it won't fit my 83 Vanagon, the guy either lied
&gt; or sent the wrong part.


There were a VERY small number of VERY early watercooled Vanagons that used
a 215mm clutch. (Also '75 busses used them.)  So few that in all the clutch
kits I've sold I've only run up against one Vanagon that took one.
(Interestingly, it was a Canadian vehicle, titled as an '82, not an '83, but
wasserboxer-engined.)  Besides that, all '76-91 take 228mm.
