Subject: Re: [T2]front doors won't open

	Our '70 can't be unlocked from outside if it
was locked from inside OR if it was locked from outside
and the door then tried.. so I leave it unlocked.
Got a Club on the wheel. Someone said my latch was
missing a spring, but I've never seen the spring in junk
yards or parts catalogs or shop manauls.
	Give yourself a hour and you can take the lock
AND latch off and clean and lube both. It should OPEN
from outside, but might not unlock :)

	Bill
