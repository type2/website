Subject: Type 4 Oil pump options

So, I buy a new Meyle oil pump: 111 115 107BK, ($22.97 from Bus Depot)
for my '82 Vanagon, while-I-am-in-there, but it is too deep and hits the 
cam.  If it was just the tab which drives it I could grind a mm off it 
but it is more than that.  The boss for the second gear goes in too deep 
as well.

The other option from Busdepot was $234.90, the Melling 021 115 109A, 
which is the original part number.   234.90 vs 22.97 hmmm ...

What are the other options?  Aircooled_dot_net version which also takes some 
grinding and then uses a flat, type 1 cover plate?

BTW, I got my refurbed heads back with all new seats, shown here;

If anyone wants this new 111 105 107BK, I will send it to you at a minor 
loss for $20US plus shipping.  Otherwise it goes back to the supplier.

Thanks,

GG
