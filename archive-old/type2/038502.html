&gt;I have a newly acquired 1980 Vanagon Westfalia. It has the RM 182 model 
&gt;Dometic refrigerator in it. To run on 12 volts, it requires a very small 
&gt;size, 10 amp rated fuse. I have checked a couple RV places and several auto 
&gt;parts places without finding any. They sent me to Radio Shack. I found 6.5 
&gt;amp fuses but no 10 amp fuses. Where can I find the right fuse? Thanks for 
&gt;the help, I am having a great time with my &quot;new&quot; VW.
