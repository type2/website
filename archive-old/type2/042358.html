my bus doesn't have a name :(

Mike,
my advice would be to let the bus tell you its name,
just look at it, sit in it and let it conjer up a
memory or whatever and after a while a name will pop
into your head.   but if help you want, then help you
get.   off  the top of my head i would say:.......

Julius....as in Orange Julius

just a suggestion.
happy friday!
