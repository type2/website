Ok, first - i've been through the archives a thousand times for anything that
has to do with a noise - I havn't found any that explains this one.

To my delight I recently fixed a loud constant noise that had been driving me
crazy - misadjusted hyd. lifters!

To my dismay, it was covering up another noise - here are the specs -

- 1979 2.0, hyd. lifters, FI
- only upon acceleration, or revving up the engine
- never when deaccelerating
- i went through and unplugged every spark-plug - doesn't matter by cylinder
- it sounds like a freaking diesel engine - coulda coulda coulda coulda
(really fast and deep)
- makes the noise up hills, or acceleration - if driving a constant speed on
the flat, no noise!
- can also hear the noise when you turn the engine off, right before it stops
rotating

If you need more specs, let me know!

Thanks in advance
