Subject: [T2] '72 parts Bus in Atlanta must go!

The Bus has good glass, except for missing the side window
behind the driver and the rear hatch window, 2 front seats, tranny
(no engine), gas tank, dash, electrics, etc., plus the rear and middle
seats.

I need to clear it out of the yard so I can buy a 1970 Bug so she'll
let me have the 1988 Fox so I can do something unnatural to it, like
mate it to another 4 door Fox and end up with a 36&quot; stretched,
4 door Fox.

We also have a bunch of Type 3 stuff (mostly '71) clogging up the
garage which I'd love to clear out as well.

Send me mail and let's work a deal!
