Subject: Re: [T2] [BP] What is this-Is it a compressor??

&gt; &gt; Since it's Friday, I thought I'd challenge the list geniuses to try to
&gt; &gt; figure this picture out. It looks to me like a homemade compressor, but
why
&gt; &gt; would it be in a Bug? The more I look at it, the more confused I get.
Look
&gt; &gt; at the electrical apparatus in there. It looks like too much work to be
a
&gt; &gt; dummy, lots of wires etc.

&gt; VErrry strange!  Obvious air intakes.  Looks like the cylinders are one
&gt; piece and they have cooling fins.  Looks like the remains of a distributor
&gt; in place, which wouldn't work for a compressor.  several heavy-duty
&gt; semiconductors (SCRs?) with massive heat sinks.  A little guage off to the
&gt; left, but I can't tell what it measures.  Workmanship looks reasonably
&gt; good, but not quite factory quality.
&gt;
&gt; If I had to guess, I'd say that it was some sort of test mule for an
&gt; exotic-fuel, or exotic cycle engine.  I'd expect to find something like
&gt; this laying around a university ME department.
&gt;

Since it's Friday, and I'd love to have a non-gasoline engine in my
mandatory bus content, let me say that I agree with the above comments, and
I would REALLY like to know what this thing is all about!
  It's definitely not a 2-stroke engine.  It's not a Stirling external
combustion, as far as I can tell, although I could be wrong on that if
there's plumbing underneath I can't see.  It appears to filter the air into
that big manifold, but then what happens?  There's no exhaust I can see.
And what's up with the non-distributor in the distributor hole?  It would
presumably spin internally, but to what effect?  Is this an elaborate
practical joke, or did a stranded alien object to the price and pollution of
gasoline and fab him/her/itself a more civilized motor??
  If anyone has any info on this thing, or any serious theory about what it
might be, I would much appreciate hearing about it!
