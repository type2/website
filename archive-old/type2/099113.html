Subject: Re: [T2] Florida inspection laws (PS)

[...]

This is a federal law applicable in any state, not just florida.  This
inspection is to determine that the vehicle meets federal emission and
safety standards.  Vehicles 25 years and older are exempt from this law.

 i have a good offer on jerri [my Bus] from a guy in the US, the
 trouble is he can't seem to get around customs until
 jan. 1 2003 when the bus is 25 years old.  the dep't of
 vehicles down there says he has to pay $500 to get it
 inspected for the US.  the odd thing is that Jerri is
 from FLA???

 any ideas?
