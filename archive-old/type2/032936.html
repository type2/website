Subject: Engine swappability

Hi all,
 
I'm looking to do an engine change and have the chance to buy a 2L vanagon
motor from an 82 (aircooled) vanagon. Will this motor install directly into
my ´72 Bus with a stock 1700 engine? What needs to modified etc? If I buy
the 2L, I'm planning on stripping off the F.I. stuff and using the stock
carbs, linkage et. al. from my 1700. Is this do-able? Problem areas and
things to consider?

All comments appreciated!

TIA,

John B.
