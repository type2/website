Subject: Re 6v starter 12 volt system &amp; 6volters

Been running this in one of my VWs for over 13 years!! Plus that is the way i
bought it!!
Possibly has been in there about 18 years with the same 6volt starter--and
around 50,000+ miles--I &quot;rent&quot; my battery from Checker--every 2 years i trade it
in on a new one--Also for you all 6 volters--try using an 8 volt battery!! kick
up your voltage regulator--and you have more juice--and you never have to change
a bulb!! leave in all your 6 volt stuff--It works great!!
TWWM, uj
