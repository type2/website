&gt; Hi Alan,
&gt; 
&gt; I assume you mean CV joint boots...
&gt; 
&gt; The only reason for not having a clamp on the inner end is that the person
&gt; fitting the boot either didn't bother or forgot.

Some folk see how tight the boot hugs the axle and decided that it would
be better not to clamp the boot to the axle, the idea being that clamping
it might put added stress on the boot.  I tend not to agree, but there
isn't really any harm in it as long as the boot fits tightly.

&gt; If the CV boots are undamaged but missing the clamp then you could just use
&gt; a wide tie wrap around the boot end to prevent further ingress of water and
&gt; dirt but it would be better to take it off, clean it an repack it with new
&gt; Molybendium grease first.

A narrow worm-drive hose clamp works nicely, but don't get carried away
with tightening it.
&gt; 
&gt; All the CV boots I've ever bought have always come with the clamp, 6 new
&gt; trisquare bolts (remember folks VW say these are use once items) and the
&gt; correct grease repacking the joint.
&gt; 
&gt; If the boot kit doesn't come with all these bits then source a different
&gt; make of boot!

Well, the best boots I've used come with grease but not the bolts.  I have
reused the bolts and never had a problem with them.  They are not
&quot;stretch&quot; bolts, so the only thing you have to worry about is munging the
triple square opening.  I put a small dab of antisieze on the threads and
torque then carefully.

Has anyone broken a CV bolt?  Most of the problems I see are stuck bolts.
