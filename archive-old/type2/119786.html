&gt; any good advice on patching a small hole (about 1&quot;) on the heater box?
Is there a specific material that should be used?  JB?  Is this a bad
idea?  I've heard of exhaust being patched so I assume it's do-able.

I just cut a patch out of some light sheet steel and braze it into place.
It doesn't have to be pretty, just cover the hole.
