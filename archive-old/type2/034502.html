Subject: propane furnace option

&quot;4,000 btu thermostatically controlled outside vented furnace system.&quot;(i
just wrote that first cause I was memorizing it in my head from when I read
it!) Ok so thats what I have in Blue. Its taken out at the moment but Ill be
putting it back in soon. It uses propane and I am unsure if it even works.
The button or dial/button that activates it is unmarked and I have no idea
how to even turn it on. If you turn it and push in I can hear a
click(ignite?)  since there is no propane in my outside tank I hvnt tested
it. I also am unsure as to the integrity on the tank.
Is it wise to have a small propane tank &quot;inside&quot; the hull? Do you turn on
the tank and just leave it on while your using it or can you just leave it
on all the time(switched when there is no draw to the furnace or stove?) AND
lastly :) how can I dry run my furnace? would I be able to use the little
propane canisters (that i get for free from work.. :)
If anyone has this option and knows how to work it , P-mail me. It should be
more comfy working on Blue in the winter when there is some heat back there.
Thank you all!!!
Luv ya  :)
take care
Steve
