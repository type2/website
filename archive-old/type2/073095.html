I've been re-thinking my tire situation and have contacted Discount Tire
national office with my complaint of them warrantying the original tires
I purchased with down graded lesser tires.

From my records I had the right tires seven years ago when I installed
them but with each warranty I was given lower quality tires as equal
under the warranty. In reality they been stickin it to me!
I would say that this is a case of *ignorance is bliss*
Well guys you've opened my eyes and I'm not at the least blissfull now,
I'm irate.

Stan,

I got the Michelin Agilis 61 for Jenny (81 Westy) and can recommend them. I
got the set  October (185 x14). I paid $486.30: 4 x 119.95 (tires incl.
mounting and new valves; disposal of old tires $1.50 each) from a local
tire dealer (Ron's Discount Tires in Wilmington, DE). He ordered them for
me. The local VW dealer (VW Smith) would have ordered them too and prices
were very similar.

	Karl.
