Subject: [&lt;F&gt;] What's that NOISE?

Greetings list -

After spending a week in my new mechanized, computerized, hydraulicized, 
auto-everything, can't-hear-a-thing-ized, can't-feel-the-road-ized, 
V10-motor-ized new ride, I had to call that quits, and take the Bus for a 
spin.

I unlocked the drivers door (nope, no digital entry system here!) and jumped 
in. However, when I turned the ignition key (nope, no voice activated 
ignition switch here!), there bacame a strange rumbling in the back. What 
the heck is THAT?

Help!

Mike &amp; Itch
