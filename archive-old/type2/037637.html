&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi All
&gt;&gt; &gt; HELP! Does anyone out there have or know where I can get a stud remover
&gt;&gt; &gt; for stripped Type 4 round port exhaust studs.


I have broken two sets of these Harbor Freight stud removers on these
studs.  The Chinese metal they use is not strong enough.. I recommend you
look into one from Mac Tools or remove the head and take it to a machine
shop to get these out.

Have fun
