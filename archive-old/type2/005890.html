&gt;Now that REALLY makes a lot of sense to me.  All I have is a 'click'
&gt;wrench.  Can you recommend a good dial wrench?

&gt;&gt;The &quot;Proper&quot; method of torquing is measuring the &quot;run on torque&quot; and then
&gt;&gt;adding those numbers to the final torque specs For example
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;A bolt has  an 18 Lb/ft spec, it takes 4 lb/ft of &quot;run on torque&quot; to run the
&gt;&gt;bolt onto the threads. The aactual torque should be set to 22 lb/ft. With
&gt;&gt;this method threads can be filled with rt, and be torques EXACTLY..This is
&gt;&gt;the method instructed in Turbine engine school, and what I live by.....

Does this mean that the resistance of untorqued fasteners adds to the spec
and requires a higher value to make the spec EXACTLY ? I was confused
before, but now i'm lost. My question was, &quot; Does a slippery lubricant &quot;
cause the torque spec to be incorrect, and is it on the high or low side?
This has been a concern for connecting rods and cylinder heads when
locktite is applied, insofar as it works as a lubricant before it sets up.
