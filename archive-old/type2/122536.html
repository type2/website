&gt;&gt; And the hose on the beetle injectors (116) is pre-curved. I have a set in my
&gt;&gt; spares box. I have these exact injectors on a 2.0 bus engine and they work
&gt;&gt; perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; Great. These injectors are far more abundant at low prices.

I think I bought a set of these beetle injectors on ebay for les than 20
dollars each, but first I made sure they would work in a bus application.
This chart is how I knew the 116 would be fine to use in a bus, it is the
same part! (with a different hose).

&gt; 
&gt; There are two beetle injectors (75-76 112, 77-79 116). I don't see how the
&gt; later ones with the long hose fit. Is this photo inaccurate?
&gt; 
I can't comment on the accuracy of the photo. It would not be difficult to
make any of them fit in any application, but the ones with the curved hose
will fit best in a beetle. To use the beetle ones in a bus, simply remove
the curved hose and replace with straight hose of the correct length.

&gt; What about the flowrate of the 112 injectors (early FI beetle, and 914)? Is
&gt; it the same as 114/116?

Not sure about that. Logic would say it is.
