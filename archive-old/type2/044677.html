If you have the vacuum dizzy, you should fix it up and put it back in if
it's what's supposed to be on your engine.  It provides for smoother and
better fuel performance.

&gt; Hey listies,
&gt; 
&gt; I solved two of my problems today. I think a vaccum leak was causing my #4
&gt; cylinder to seem like it was inactive. That's fixed so I'm running on all
&gt; 4 again. I did the timing right with a tach dwell and strobe light and the
&gt; advance seems to work.( I'm running this with amechanical only and would
&gt; prefer to keep it that way for the sake of simplicity) Any strong
&gt; objections? Also today I somehow overcame the flashing oil light syndrome
&gt; and power loss. I changed the oil with 20W50. Maybe the other adjustments
&gt; helped somehow??   I still have a big oil leak and the engine is pretty
&gt; damm hot after a short test run. I remember bending the dipstick sleve
&gt; when installing the motor. The leak comes from the area around the
&gt; alternater where the rbber bootie thing hooks on and the suspect dipstick.
&gt; I t leaks alot whenever the engine is running. Any common leak spots known
&gt; of there.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to all the responses whether they were accurate or not they helped
&gt; my thinking process. Here I am with a practically roadworthy bus.
