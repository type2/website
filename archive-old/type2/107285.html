Subject: ordered tires...interesting

Folks,

I have gotta say, the folks at tirerack_dot_com are on the ball...and nice to 
boot!

Ordered the yoko's for my bus and some other tires for a hi-po ford I 
have...they flagged my order cause the bus tires did not fit my ford...a 
very nice lady called me to find out what was up and explain that 5 of the 
tires i ordered would not fit my ford...LOL

I explained what the deal was and she understood...but!...I had a very 
nice talk with her and she explained why they are so tight on this kind of 
stuff...especially when you order rims.

Lots of folks are apparently ordering the wheels and tires to get 
the...ummm..what look is it?...where your wheels stick out about 2 feet 
outside the wheel wells and look to be about 10&quot; in diameter....then they 
want to send them back when it really didn't work...

I really want some of the 15&quot; or 16&quot; wheels, but will wait and put them
on my 68 dc next year sometime.

Bus content...I did order tires!


Cheers, dave
