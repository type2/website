Subject: RE: [T2] Injection problems - maybe the fuel pressure?

One year after bringing the van out of storage it would not start.  I
tried everything and it would not start. I had a local classic VW shop
look at it and it turned out that all four injectors had been damaged
internally by freezing water in the fuel.  Four new injectors later it
was up and running!

Matt
&gt; Dear all,
&gt;
&gt; I (my 16 yr old son, actually) bought a 1977 Westy recently. It wasn't

&gt; running when we got it. We rebuilt the engine. It's in the bus now, 
&gt; but doesn't start. It cranks like mad, there's voltage in all the 
&gt; right places, and a VOM on the injector resistors shows a needle at 
&gt; 12V when not cranking, and bouncing around when cranking. From this I 
&gt; infer that the computer is turning the injectors on. And our spare 
&gt; computer does exactly the same thing.
