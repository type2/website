Hi all,

    I'm about to embark on a journey, to rebuild a 1.8L to a 2.0L type IV. I
know I need a crankshaft and rods from a 2.0L, but what else might I need?
Also I might go to Hydraulic lifters/cam, does that require any machining?
    I will be looking for a flywheel in good shape, to mate a 74 type IV to
a 72 type I tranny, I think a 200mm or 215mm works. I'm also considering a
cooling conversion but it doesn't seem to work with FI, a lot of extra money
for the conversion, manifolds, carbs., and linkage.
    This might be the wrong list for this but, anyone have a disk brake
setup that will fit a 72 type I, also need the rear brakes from a type II or
IV, backing plates and all?
    I live in the Northwest and am also looking for a reputable shop to do
some machine work, any ideas?

Any ideas or help/parts will be much appreciated.

Thank you,

Mike
