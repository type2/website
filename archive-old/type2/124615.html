Subject: Re: [T2] Ball Joints Revisited

My Harbor Freight 20 ton press was about $160 complete with arbor plates.
However, I found it very difficult in getting just the tie rod off the ball
joint in order to install new rubber ball joint boots. I recall reports of
some shops bending presses trying to get ball joints out of torsion arms.
Some where in the achieves I read that heat was the best method of removing
ball joints Heating until cherry red and striking with a &quot;BF&quot; hammer were
terms I recall in the removal process.

&gt; The Bentley shows a standard press being used for ball joints if the
&gt; arms are removed from the bus. Is this correct? Because Harbor Freight
&gt; has some inexpensive presses right now. Like $45 or so...
