I heard this:

Anyway, when I got to taking the six main nuts
and bolts off the case I found I had to use a long punch (made out of nice
soft brass) to get out the bolts.  when I got the bolts out there were some
sort of plastic certs on the bolts which is obviously the reason I had to
use the punch.  Do I need to get new ones on these for the rebuild?  What
are they called?  
 
So....The little plastic split sleeves are in there for a reason..and you
din't have to kill them to get the case apart.. if you had pulled the case
apart, they would no longe have been captive...and you would have just spread
them open and the bolts would ahve come out....but oh well..
What do they do?..I dunno..align the bolts with the case at the
factory?..dampen the resonance of the bolts? Keep the little plastic parts
elves busy?
 I'd put 'em back...and you should find them in you gasket set.....

and then *YIKES*!!!!!!!

Also,  the front of the case started to split with a
couple of hits from the rubber hammer and the back seem to be a little more
difficult.  Do I need to remove the flywheel for any reason before I split
the case.

Only if you want to get the case apart!....there are fasteners back there..and
do not forget the one buried between the lifter bores on the driver's (?)
side...man it's been a long time....
