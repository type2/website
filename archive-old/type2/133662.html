Subject: Re: [T2] accessory plug update

Hi Michael,

I'm not sure if the '71 is the same, but I mounted an accessory plug under 
the dash of my '79, and I find it's a good location.  I used the parking 
brake mounting bracket, and put the socket all the way forward, up against 
the front bulkhead.  The socket had an L-shaped bracket on top, so I just 
removed an existing screw and put the bracket in place under the screw.  My 
cellphone charger cord reaches from there up to the glove box, and the 
socket is out of the way when things aren't plugged into it.

I've also seen an accessory socket put into the dash near the knobs for 
wipers and flashers.  However, the hole that's already stamped into the 
metal is too small, and will have to be drilled/cut to fit the new socket.  
If you're concerned about someday returning your Bus to full stock, consider 
using a less invasive place for your aftermarket socket.  As always, YMMV.

Good luck!
