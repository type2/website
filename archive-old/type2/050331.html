Subject: [T2] Source for BN-2 glow plugs?

Anyone have a source for these?  Mine is burned out due to my own
stupidity.  The part number is Beru 195GLS.  I have a phone number for Beru
here in the US and I will be calling them in the morning, but can anyone
save me some time and tell me where I can purchase this part or a Bosch or
other equivalent?  My poor bus needs heat!

Thanks,

-David
