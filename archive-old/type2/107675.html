Subject: [T2] vacuum advance


&gt; How can you test a vacuum canister?
&gt;
&gt; Isn't there some rule about being able to blow into it or not or
&gt; something like that to know it the little bladder inside is still
&gt; working correctly or not?

It's a VACUUM advance, so make like a vacuum and suck on the pipe coming out
of the canister.  If it's working you should see the plate to which the
points are attached rotate around the center shaft slightly, advancing the
timing.

If you're really ambitious you could partially tear down the distributor
itself and inspect, clean and lubricate the mechanical advance mechanism
since I suppose funkiness in this area could also contribute to unstable
timing, but I still think it's more likely you're facing just a plain,
worn-out distributor.
