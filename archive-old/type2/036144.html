Subject: Re: What Distributor Do I have

[...]


&gt; Sorry, I had a finger/brain check on that distributor number that
&gt; I have in my '71.  The real number is 023 117 036.  My main
&gt; concern is that I do not know what the correct timing is for this
&gt; distributor.  Sorry about the invalid number.  Would appreciate
&gt; it if anyone knows more about this distributor.

You are missing a number. It should be a group of 4, then a group of 3, then
a group of 3. The first group should be 0231.
