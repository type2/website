hi there,
im writing from germany. i´m restoring a 1976 westalia helsinki camper
(can see it on my hp) and need some special parts. i´m almost finished
and realised that two little parts are american parts. the power plug on

the outside of the bus and the vent cover from the plumbing (both left
side).

can you tell me where i can find it. best would be a online shop.

thank you
stefan bauhaus
