Subject: Replacing the dogbus

Hi folks -

I'm in a co-op that owns a house on an island only accessible to vehicles 
via WWII landing craft -- I kid you not.  We have a 77 automatic bus out 
there we use to get from the passenger ferry dock to the house and, 
naturally, it's rusting to pieces in the sea air.  So we're looking for a 
donor body that we'll seal up as best we can, take it out there, and 
cannibalize the rusty-but-running 77.

I'm not up to speed on late bays, but I'm assuming our engine will fit 
just about any Type IV-engined bay body?

Regarding our auto tranny, if the donor is a manual, can the automatic 
components (tranny, linkage, etc.) just be bolted right into a manual body 
or will we need to do some mods?  If the donor has a working manual tranny 
we may not bother -- the island's dirt roads don't really allow you to get 
above 3rd gear, so a tranny with bad 4th wouldn't be an issue.

The donor doesn't have to be pretty, just fairly solid.  If anyone has any 
leads near Tallahassee, Florida I'd be grateful, but for now I'm mainly 
interested in answers to the tech questions.

TIA,
Joe
