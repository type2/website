Subject: Fuel sender replacement (longish), w/small plea for help

Well, I just finished a job I'd been dreading for months.
It finally got above freezing here, so I decided to replace the fuel sending 
unit on my '78 Westfalia.
I anticipated HUGE problems with the two screws that go up from the bottom 
and hold the firewall in place.  Long extension (actually 2) and a 
screwdriver tip-NO PROBLEM.
I then anticipated further problems, though not as bad, with the remainder of 
the screws but again, no problem.
I was scared almost to the point of quitting when I saw the tiny amount of 
room between the tank and the 'parcel shelf' above it.  But I remembered 
somebody said it could be done-barely- and they were right.  It took some 
wiggling but I finally got it out of there.  More wiggling got the new one in 
(careful not to bend the arm for the float!) and the hardest part of the job 
was tapping the sender to screw it into the tank (had to bend a screwdriver a 
little here and hold down on the center of the unit with a long extension), 
but that wasn't even bad.
In fact, the worst part of the job was getting my wife out to the garage to 
push the wires onto the sender.  (I'm a big guy and I have ham hands) but it 
only took her a few minutes.  Everything went back together pretty easily and 
nothing had to be folded, spindled , mutilated, or cut to accomplish the job 
(There was a little prying to get the top of the firewall out and then back 
in, but not too bad.)
I guess my message is that if you are dreading this job and figuring the 
approximate amount of fuel in your tank in your noggin (major PiTA, 
especially if you don't drive it everyday.  Let me see, was that last 
Thursday or Friday that I filled the tank?) because you don't want to cut any 
holes in your bus or bend anything up, don't.
It's not that bad and I feel like a fool for dreading it.  (In case you are 
wondering, about 2 hrs. 15 min.)
Tips if you are going to try this at home:
1. Have a long extension or screwdriver (Phillips) to take out the screws 
from underneath.
2. You'll need another long screwdriver (common) to tap the old sender unit 
loose and the new one tight. (I had to bend mine slightly to tap the new one 
tight)
3. I used 3 small (tiny, actually) pieces of masking tape to hold the new 
rubber seal to the new sender.  Shouldn't hurt anything.
4. It's possible to tap the new sender too far when tightening it and pop it 
out of the 'ears' on the tank, so look at the position of the old one before 
you take it out (wires on mine pointed straight back) and tap the new one to 
the same position.
5. To get the sender in or out of the tank compartment, slide it to one side 
or the other- there's more room on the sides.  Just don't bend the float arm! 
 Take your time!
6.  Be careful around that open tank! (trouble lights!)

Now, about Karma.  (Getting long, I know. You were warned, remember?)
I don't really believe in Karma, but I'm beginning to wonder.  
This Bus responds very positively to my attempts to repair and maintain it.  
It's really kind of strange how easy this thing can be to work on. (by 
comparison, my save-the-Westy-from-the-salt Omni tried to eat me alive and 
fought me every step of the way as I changed an alternator belt the other 
day- bad Karma there.  Must be because it is being sacrificed to the Sodium 
Gods)
Seriously (almost), its almost spooky how this bus is.  I'm not complaining, 
mind you, but I sure hope that I don't offend it inadvertently somehow and 
make it hate me.  I'm sure that it could be a real bear if it wanted to.

PS If anyone on the list lives in one of those rust free states (OK or east, 
especially) and is a junkyard frequenter and would be willing to keep an eye 
out for something I need for a non VW project that I am having real difficulty
 finding, please e mail me at mbjeeper_at_aol_dot_com
Thanks!
