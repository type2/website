=================================&gt;
I have a plastic bolt (actually a &quot;license plate&quot; bolt from a license 
plate mounting kit, I think) that I use when changing fuel filters.
I just screw the little bolt into the fuel line to stop the gas 
dribble, and then pull it out when I am ready to jam the new filter 
into the line.
I keep the bolt with my spare fuel filters so it is right there for my 
use when it is time to do a filter change-out.

Never thought about installing a small ball valve ahead of the fuel 
filter.
Gonna look into it.
Maybe I can find one that I will feel comfy with.
