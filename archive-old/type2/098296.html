Subject: Re: [T2] Has anyone installed a BA4 up front on a Vanagon?

[...]

Whoops...

I have a BA6 already... I was asking about a BA4 aparently 
there was an error in the text of my message.

Thanks,
Chris

??  Your subject title says BA4. But your 1st paragraph says 
BA6. Then you say BA4 in the 2nd paragraph......
