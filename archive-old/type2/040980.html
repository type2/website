Subject: RE: Bus vs. Westy

 As a visual reference, if it has the jalousie side windows (the louvered
 ones), it's probably a Westy (in the USA, anyway. In other parts of Mother
 Earth, I think the UK Devon model is the most popular camper conversion,
 list?).

I saw in a street in Adelaide Sth Australia last week, a set of the louvred
windows in the pics I get of Westies, I drove up and saw a teutonic type of
late middle ager driving it. It had &quot;Westfalia&quot; written on it I looked a lot
and we parted with a wave.
 Were they franchised about or simply drive OS?
 We have a conversion from then called a Sopru, very well done and a few are
still about the place, but the Westy looked GOOD.
