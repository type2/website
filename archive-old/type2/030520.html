&gt; Here's the biggest question...the kicker:
&gt; 
&gt; Can I expect that a type 2 in good running order will make it form my
&gt; temporary home here in Fresno to my house back in DC?  In November?  Or
&gt; should I just let my little Toyota pickup tow it back?  Or bring the tow bar
&gt; and drive it when it runs- tow it when it doesn't?
Well,

They sold these cars new at one time, and i'm quite sure you could take
one off the showroom floor and drive it anywhere you wanted.

I've put close to 100k on 2 busses over the last few years, and i only own
busses, its all i drive anymore. period.

Either return your bus to mechanically perfect condition or bring spares
and tools to fix things.

Its a car damnit, if you want a trailer buy a trailer, busses are for
driving trailers are for towing, whats the freaking point of having a bus
that runs and hauling it around like a coleman camp trailer.

But, if its in poor mechanical condition expect the trip to be an
adventure.

I drive my busses daily, that way suspect parts show their colors in town
and i can replace them with the best available spares, i am more
comfortable taking road trips that way as i know my bus is in tip top
shape, and once i've replaced something it wont fail for a while.

take care,

Steve
