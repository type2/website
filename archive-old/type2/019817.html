Subject: Engine Cleaning

1)  Thanks to volunteers that responded to mentor myself and Chris &amp;
Kell!!!  You guyz rock!

2)  Preparatory to begin diagnosing and repairs, I need to clean my
engine/compartment.  There's a bit of relatively clean oil (from
blow-by, near as I can figger) ALL over the engine compartment, and I'm
leaking from probably many different places...  Plenty of oil, but it
doesn't appear TOO crusty inside the engine compartment, all in all. 
'72 poptop with a 914 engine...

I've searched over 60 pages in the archives for engine cleaning, but
still don't have the answers I need:

It appears that the engine compartment is sealed...  I'm afraid spraying
a cleaner inside and then attempting to hose is just going to create a
huge mess.  What's wrong with my understanding?  Will the stuff really
drain out well with no removal of anything, or do I need to remove some
sheet metal or plugs or something?

And a tip - my sister turned the whole family onto this GREAT stuff
called Soilove.  It's a laundry soil-stain remover that kicks baked on
grease's butt.  Removes nasty environmental grime, too - for your
poptops and greasy handprints!  They began using it on the nasty grime
streaks on their RV.  In CA Bay Area I get it at Safeway - green bottle
in the laundry section.

Ingredients:  Monobutyl Ether, Sodium Metasilicate, Phosphorus 0.75%,
Aluminum Hydroxide.

This would be my first choice for an engine degreaser, having seen what
it can do with baked on stove grease (and old smoking pipes).  BUT -
does anyone know if these ingredients are detrimental to rubber or other
materials in the engine compartment?

Do I need to protect any particular bits?  It seems it would NOT be a
great idea to get this stuff (or any other cleaner) in my air filters or
directly into the fan...

Rank Newbie - just don't want to screw anything up!

Thanks!

Teri
