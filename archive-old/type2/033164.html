Subject: Re: bus reonvation begins...

&gt;At Home Depot, (toy store for big boys) I was shopping for 1/8 inch
&gt;skins and much to my surprise, they have stopped selling them.!

I just bought a bunch of wood for my bus from Boulter Plywood, in
Somerville, MA [just outside of boston]. i bought 4x8 sheets of 1/8&quot;
mahogAny to redo all the wood siding in my bus [installation begins today].
they sell all sorts of plywood, including 5'x5'x1/8&quot; [3mm] baltic birch,
which you'd need for the ceiling if you want it original.

anyway, they ship all over the country, and they came highly recommended
from a boatbuilder friend of mine. - http://www.boulterplywood_dot_com
