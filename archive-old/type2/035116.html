Subject: Calibrating your gas gauge

Such a useful thing to do, I am surprised more people don't do it.

Drive without refueling until your gauge is in the red. Park, disconnect 
the fuel line, and drain into a gas can until empty. Replace fuel line 
and clamp.

Now: draw a picture of the gauge dial. Turn your key to on and note where
the indicator is when the tank is dead empty. Then pour in some exact
fraction of a gallon of the gas you have collected in the can: 1/4 gallon,
1/2 gallon, 1 gallon.  Whatever you have. Turn your key to on and note 
the position now.

Next, drive to a gas station and pull up to a pump. Don't do this at rush 
hour. Explain to the guy in the booth what you are doing, and that you'll 
be there for a few minutes.

Add a gallon. Note the position of the needle. Add another gallon. Note 
position of the needle. Be sure to give the sender and the gauge time to 
adjust and settle down. Keep at it, gallon by gallon, until the tank is full.

Back home, make a clean picture of your notes, perhaps showing two gallon 
intervals except for the first and the last.

Congrats. You've callibrated your gauge. No more guessing.

Especially important, at the bottom end, for FI buses, since the pump is 
cooled by the gas flowing through it, and will burn out if you run out.
