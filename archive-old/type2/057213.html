Subject: RE: Fuel Pressure Gauge?

Harmon,

I've used a &quot;mechanical&quot; (with tubing) oil pressure gauge hooked up to
an in-line 
t-fitting I made up -- works well for checking FI pump pressure. On my
CB 
Performance DFI system I have an adjustable fuel pressure regulator that
needs
Adjusted to 42 psi so I came up with this setup.

Scott





Awhile back I saw mention of someone installing a VDO fuel pressure
gauge -- I've looked all over in catalogs, magazines, etc. for a listing
of such, but don't see any. Does anyone know who sells them? Tried VDO's
website (http://www.vdo_dot_com) but that's pretty useless.
