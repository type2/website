I was going to leave from Orlando Friday morning at 7:00 am. I was going to
go straight up 95 but could go up 75 if we could get a caraVan going that
way.

Anybody from Fl, Ga, Ms, or Al planning on heading up to the High Country
Bus Fest?  Looking for people to carbus with.  I'll be heading from
Pensacola &amp; probably heading through Atlanta.
