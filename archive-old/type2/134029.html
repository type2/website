Subject: Re: [T2] Westy/Screen in pop top

You guys aren't thinking far enough outside the, uh, breadbox.

If the screens are rotting but the canvas is good, how tough would it be 
to stitch new screens in in back of the old ones?  Just overlay it and sew 
or glue the new screens -- the whole window -- in place.  Good enough if 
you mainly want to keep bugs out, and will only look kludgy if you do a 
slack job of it.

ie, don't try to re-stitch as per original.  IMO it would make more sense 
to replace the whole canvas if that's what you want to do.
