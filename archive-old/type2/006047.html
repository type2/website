You have very dood intentions, wise man.....The case must be split, to
remove the cam...When shopping for rebuilt heads, choose to have yours
rebuilt by RIMCO, we use them for our stock head jobs...

Subject: [T2] valves-from hydraulic to manual OK?


&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt;   I have an 1800 engine I've been running in combo with a 78 van 2 litter
&gt; fuel injection system for several years. Although it seems underpowered it
&gt; has run OK and even passes the emission tests fine here in Seattle.
&gt;  My question to you is this: I'm wanting to take it out to solve some
&gt; problems with oil leaks and exhaust leaks. I thought this would be a good
&gt; time to have the heads rebuilt while I have the engine out. I think I
might
&gt; want to convert back to manually adjusted valves since I think adjusting
&gt; valves is no big deal and I seem be losing faith in the hydraulic
&gt; valves.Plus they cost more.
&gt;   I'm just wondering if it is possible to switch back now without breaking
&gt; open the case. I guess I'll just be pulling out the hydraulic lifters and
&gt; putting in regular ones,right? Anything else I need to do?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Neil Sundberg
