Subject: SUCCESS!!!  (was re: brake drum saga..)

Hello all,

Today we vanquished the evil brake drum! It no longer LOOKS much like a
brake drum but we have removed it!!!  (applause applause)

We had to make our own long wheel bolts by sawing off the heads of the lug
bolts we bought and, using lug nuts, we screwed them deep into the drum and
got the five arm puller on nice and snug. (We were worried about possibly
pulling unevenly the way we were trying it the other day.) We lit up the
blowtorch and cooked the drum then used hammers to whack it. We used two
hammers... one on each side of the drum... in order to deaden the blows so
as not to destroy the axle, bearings, etc.

It took us hours of cooking, pounding and tightening of the puller and
saying &quot;Wait... does it look like there's a gap there? No... wait... kinda
maybe??&quot; That puller made a huge difference but it was hard to get that on
tight. Those homemade bolts we &quot;made&quot; really made the difference. My guy
used a large wrench on the puller as I banged away. We still can't believe
that it is off! We are so physically and emotionally drained by this whole
experience... but relieved.

The inside is corroded and rusted as we expected. The whole thing is frozen
essentially.

You're all really smart cookies... several list members wrote to help me and
I appreciate ALL the suggestions. If anyone is out there thinking I did not
take their advice seriously... forget it... because all of your posts really
helped a lot. Even if I didn't use the advice (either cuz the bus isn't
driving or for some other reason) I definitely used the encouragement! Thank
you!!!

The back brakes did/do not work at all (wheel cylinders are
leaking/corroded) and the PO told us that he had tried to remove the drum
during a hot august day and gave up...

Thanks,
Jen :-)
