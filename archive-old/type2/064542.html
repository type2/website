&gt;Hi, I am a little confused when it comes to chassis numbers.

&gt;Bentley says the exhaust valve clearance for Dual-carburetor engines:
&gt;through chassis number:  213 2210 553 is .006&quot;
&gt;and from chassis number: 213 2210 554 is .008&quot;
&gt;
&gt;My chassis number is 233 2169 609, so what should I set the exhaust valves to?

213 and 233 are the same except one is a Kombi and one a panel van, or
something like that.  You can just read those #'s as 233.

As for the valve clearances, set your exhaust valves to .008 despite what
the book says.  Little extra margin of safety, if you ask me, and they
don't seem to clatter at .008.
