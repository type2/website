Subject: Bench front bay - possible one FS

I remembered during the recent discussion that a member of our local VW 
club may still be trying to sell his (I think) 1970 bench-front bay.  
If anyone is looking for one of these critters p-mail me and I'll find 
out more about status and details.  Location would be Tallahassee, FL.  
IIRC there are two early bay bench-fronts in town, and I think both 
have full partitions.  And both are white/yellow.

My '65 spl*tty is a bench, first bus I've owned like that (I've had 4 
walk-thrus), and I agree they have a charm of their own.  If memory 
serves, I rode to the grocery store squeezed into the front bench of 
Ellis's RFH with Paula and Rachel Hollis back in the day.  Can't do 
that in a walk-thru, no sir.
