&amp;gt; Hello Everyone,
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; I am new to the list and I would like some advice.Upon returning to the
US I will buy a baywindow bus, my question is what is the best engine to use in the van or single cab.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; Two questions:
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; 1. Will the Jeep 2.5L fit under the engine top cover of a 68 - 79 vw
van, or will I need to raise the access lid?
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; 2. Is there a better engine to use that will fit my needs, while
maintaining simplicity and reliability.

Never heard of anyone using a Jeep engine in a bus.

The usual conversions are Corvair, Toyota, and Subaru, as well as some
watercooled VW engines.

Of these, my personal aesthetic prefers the Corvair and Subaru, since they
are flat engines.

The corvair turns the wrong way, so you have to either
modify the engine to turn the correct direction, or install the Corvair
engine and transmission as a unit.

The Subaru turns the correct direction and there are a number of them out
there running.  Kennedy Engineered Products even makes a CARB-legal
conversion for the Vanagon.  The problem with the Subaru is that you will
have to figure out how to install a radiator on your bus!
