&gt; This weekend I tried to tackle my drivers door lock, with little success.

&gt; The problem is that I cannot unlock the drivers door from the outside.
&gt; (I have to climb in from the passenger side.)  
&gt; 
&gt; However, if the door is open, the key will flip the little lever (this is a
&gt; 1970 bus)
&gt; from open to locked and back again - perfectly and easily.

Stop trying to use the lock!  You will break something!  I found out the
hard way!

What has happened is that a small spring has broken in the lock mechinism.
This spring makes it so that the door automatically unlocks if it is
closed without the trigger depressed.

The fix is to replace the spring.  See the following article in the Type 2
Library:

While you're in there, be sure to clean and lube the lock cylinder and
lock mechinism.
