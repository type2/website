Subject: Electrical Problem

Hello Everyone.   With the help of various list members I reattached the
left side running light and replaced the broken plastic clips with
plastic nuts and bolts.  (thanks to all who replied)  Now I have a
strange electrical problem.  Before I started the above task I noticed
the right side rear running light was out so I bought a bulb to replace
it.  Unfortunately the new bulb does not work either.  I put a volt
meter on the contacts without the bulb and got a 12V reading so I know I
am getting juice.  I then put the bulb back in and  connected the
voltmeter to the contacts from the back side and it reads zero.  As soon
as I take the bulb off the contacts it reads 12v again.  I then took the
bulb out and placed the positive and negative wires to the respective
contacts on the bulb itself, no dice.  I know the bulb is working
because I tested it on the other side and it lights up just fine.  Also
the bulb is definitely making contact with the plates in the socket.
Any suggestions??
Thanks in advance,
Phillip Freund
