I think that if you pull the two wires off of the the brake pressure switch
(the two that are involved in switching the brake lights - not the one that
is involved in the warning light on the dash - see your wiring diagram) and
short them together, the brake lights should go on, provided everything else
besides the pressure switch is in proper working order.  You can also test
the pressure switch by connecting an ohmeter across the two terminals
associated with the aforementioned wires, and observe whether or not the
pressure switch contacts make when you press the brake pedal. I'd do these
tests before removing the pressure switch - could save alot of unecessary
work....

thanks to the help of several listees and the Bus Depot, my highbeams
now work, and my rear flashers and tail lights work too. now onto the
brake lights. I can't figure out for the life of me what's causing
this, but they're just completely dead. there are new bulbs. all of
the ground wire contacts have been brushed clean with a wire brush,
as have the areas where they connect to the chassis. the positive
wires on both rear tail lights have had the connectors replaced, and
the connections on the sockets brushed clean. all fuses are ok, too
[just put a brand new set in, replacing all the old ones]. still, no
brake lights.

at this point, the only thing i can think of is that maybe the
pressure switch on the master cylinder is shot. I've looked in
bentley and the idiot book, and neither seem to answer this one
simple question - can i take this switch out and test it without
bleeding my brakes, or in any way running the possibility of spilling
brake fluid. bentley only shows the master cylinder in a
not-on-the-bus state.

I live in a condo, and the trustees are fascists - i'm not  supposed
to be doing anything on my bus in the parking lot, and i've been
warned [so now i have the rear of the bus against a fence, so i can
work with nobody seeing me]. in any case, anything that involves the
possibility of spilled liquids on the precious pavement, or even the
perception that liquid may be spilled, is asking for trouble. so, am
i going to have to take this to a repair shop to have it tested, or
is it something i can likely do myself with minimal fuss and no mess?

the next house i buy will be a *house* and it will have its own garage.
