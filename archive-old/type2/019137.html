I just installed a Gene Berg Dipstick temp switch on my VW a few days
ago.  It was $16 total, tax and everything.  The Gene Berg store had
so many neat stuff inside with many things I saw that is on their
homepage.  The Dipstick and it's parts are sandwitched via vaccum
between a sheet of plastic and paper.  It isn't fully assembled, you
have to crimp the red wire on both sides.  Its more of some kind of
thermo switch if thats what they're called.  Same idea used on a
toaster, rice cooker, oven, or a portaheater.  The switch that makes
the turn signal or hazzards flash.  As it heats up, a piece of metal
moves and makes contact closing a circuit.
Anyways right to the point.  My thoughts on the Dipstick:  1  Fragil
very very fragil.  Many ways you can break it by accident.  2
inconvenient to use.  why couldn't Gene Berg use a friction hook up
where the wire connects to the dipstick?  You have to undo a bolt and
put it back on each time you want to check your oil level.  3 gives
you peace of mind at a low cost.  It took me 10 min. to get the whole
thing figured out and installed.
Overall I'm satisfied and the dipstick was a wise investment.  And I'd
recomend it to anyone who would want to play it safe and know when
your having an overheat before it's too late.  All I needed was a pair
of plyers to splice the wires and crimp them.  And it worked for the
bolt too.
And I liked the idea better than a temp gauge.  It has been said the
guages arent as accurate as you would want them to be and I would
amagine the oil light blinking next to the spedometer with it's
warning buzzer would catch my attention sooner then a needle pointing
to hot.  Quick to install compared to wiring up one of those gauges. 
And I don't like the idea of a hole in the dash and an added gauge
cluster under the dash would be hard to see.  VDO makes someting that
replaces your speeker grill that you can put your extra guages in but
they don't have it in black to match the dash.  The Gene Berg Dipstick
temp switch was a smart idea.  No wonder they're sold out, maybe I got
the last one.  :)  So nice living in southern California where all
these important worldwide known shops are just in the next city.

Just my 2 Cents
Matt

Scott, do you think I could get a dipstick sender before the 13th or
so of
this month.  Might be handy driving through the rockys. PCSing to
Offutt
with a new top end in the Beetle, a little nervous.

Later,
Bruce

O.K. heres the deal. For those that want the Gene Berg Temp dip
sticks, I
can get them for $16 each + $3 shipping anywhere in the US. If you
want one,
send the money to me at the address below and I will place an order
with the
local shop. They are currently out, but will order as many as I want
and
will have them in 3-4 days. Or if I get a bunch of people wanting them
I
will just go straight to GBE and save a few bucks. I am not trying to
make
anything off these, $16 is what they sell them for localy. So if you
want
one, plan on a week, maybe two. Still they are less than $20 and well
worth
it.
I will be off the list for about two weeks so don't E-mail me, just
send the
check. I will be off work and have no contact with my computer. You
can also
call, before 9pm Westcoast time.
