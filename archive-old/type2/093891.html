Hello All     you will also have a problem with the arm on the carb hitting 
the Alternator, the carbs for alt. have the arm lower  , you either find one 
of these or take a die grinder and clearance the alt. and bend the arm to 
keep from hitting.  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing    Salem Import service
