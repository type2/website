Studs are made to replace!  Back those things out and put new ones in!

If you can still get nuts on them, just tighten two nuts against each
other and back the stud out with a wrench on the lower nut.  

If the threads are too shot for the jam nut technique, it's Vice-Grip
time.  Use a hefty pair of Vice grips and adjust them good and tight
before backing the stud out.  If they're too loose, they will slip and
increase the chance of the stud breaking off.

Once you get the studs out, use the jam nut technique to put the new
studs in, this time using the wrench on the upper nut.

Have fun!
