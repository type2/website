Subject: RE: [T2] External Oil Coolers. Who's done it?

Hi Giles- I have an external oil filter and cooler on my 71' Westy with
a 1600 DP engine. I had the engine case drilled and taped for the oil
filter and the cooler runs from those lines. 

The difference on my engine was extreme. I was running 220/240 degrees _at_
80/85 degrees F at 55 MPH.  I have a hard time getting it up to 180
degrees after driving 2 hrs on the freeway at the same temp. Goes up to
195/200 if I run at 65 MPH.

A very worthwhile addition..... TBear
