passenger seat behind the driver's seat and the sink/water tank/ ice box
(no stove) behind the front passenger seat with a pull up table. we
would like it in as original condition as possible and in good
condition. the year isn't very important as log as it is in very good
condition. we live in santa monica, ca and we will travel to pick up the
right camper.
