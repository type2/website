Subject: Uh, which wires to coil? 76won't start after head job(long).

After helping Steve Dolan pull his motor a few weeks ago I convinced
myself that I was ready to put a new cylinder head on my new bus. 
When I bought it from Pat Flynn it was running on 3 and a compression
check confirmed #4 was shot.  

After waiting 3 weeks to receive my towbar from Joe Nodzak in AZ (UPS
shipped it to Oregon by mistake) I towed my bus to a friend's house to
borrow his driveway for the weekend.  The towbar worked fine behind my
V  8 Diplomat, but I had to remove the brake booster and the steering
damper in order to fit the bar to the front axle.  My friend and I did
the head job in 2 days of 14 hours each while his 8 year old daughter
brought us peanut butter sandwiches.  By that Sunday night it was too
late to fire it up in the suburbs, so I towed it back to the boatyard
for storage waited until today to give it a try.  

Spent today in the boatyard setting the valves, plugging exhaust leaks
with muffler goo(temporary fix, I know) and trying to figure out if I
had all of the wires back on correctly. 

My problem is that I labeled all of the wires but I mistakenly have 4
wires labeled &quot;positive coil&quot;  when there are only 3 prongs.  Like
Sesame Street, now I have to &quot;guess which one doesn't belong:&quot; 

Labeled as positive I have:

1:  The wire to the condenser

2:  a white wire coming out of the loom that descends from the
auxilary heater blower.  The white wire heads towards the front-right
of the engine compartment.

3.  A black wire coming out of the same loom as #2.  this wire has hot
current when the key is on and warms up the pos. coil connections when
1,2 and 3 are connected at once. 

4.  A black wire with an in-line fuse coming from the left firewall.

On the Negative coil connection I have a tan wire with blue stripes
and 2 empty prongs.  

As noted, if I have the black wire (#3 above) connected with #1 and #2
on the + side of the coil, the heat would indicate that I am creating
a short.  Connected like this the bus will not crank.  If I remove the
hot #3 from the coil, the bus will crank but will not fire.  With the
ignition on, my test light indicates that none of the other wires are
hot.

Can anyone tell me which wires should go where?  Have I done any
potential damage to any components by hooking things up this way?

TIA.

Andrew.
