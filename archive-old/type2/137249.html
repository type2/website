Subject: Is a oil cooler a good idea ?

Hi guys , Its me again, sorry !!! .
I would like your opinion on the following for an 1983 engine:
1) How bad is the engine heat when driving in the desert in summer time 
(.i.e Death Valley)
2) I saw some oil cooler over internet for $250,
   - How reliable are they ?
   - Are they easy to install ?
   - Are they efficient,  meaning , can I go to Death Valley in summer 
time !!! ;-)
   - Any Brand better than others ?
3) Do you have any other tricks to cool down the engine like adding an 
extra fan  ?

Thanks for all your answers.

Chris
