Subject: ETKA

Hi all:

Hard drive crashed a month or so ago and just today I got around to trying to
install ETKA, which had installed and run fine before.  Kept getting various
&quot;file could not be opened&quot; errors - different files each time - even though I
can see the files on the CD.

Anything more to it than just a defective CD?

TIA.

Tom Young
