Subject: Re: [T2] bottom cooling housing flaps

I don't have the little flappers, and I understand that you probably don't
need them if you don't have or use the blower (I live in Sand Diego). I
guess it wouldn't really hurt to run the blower without them; I just don't
think you'd get any more airflow than with just the main cooling fan.

You should use the cover plates though; otherwise you probably wouldn't get
any heat up front, and you might reduce engine cooling flow. Use something
to seal them up nice and tight.

What do these flaps do and do I really need 'em? My guess is that when the
heater fan is on and the car is idling, it keeps hot air from blowing back
into the cooling fan housing. I would assume that during higher RPMs, the
cooling fan air pressure high is enough to overcome the heater fan pressure
and direct the air away from the cooling housing. Sound logical?
