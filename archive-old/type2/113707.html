Subject: Re: [T2] Ready-made headlight upgrade harnesses

&gt;Saw these on the Audi List (quattro_at_audifans_dot_com) and wondered if they'd be
&gt;adaptable to buses for the headlight upgrade:
&gt;http://suvlights.tripod_dot_com/suvlightscom/html/wire-harness.htm

Yes. However I saw these same relays for .89 cents in a Parts Express flyer 
yesterday and the wire is CHEAP.

$10 project for relays and wire. Slightly more with in-line fuses.

www.vanagon_dot_com has alot of info about it in addition to the Type2 website.

It's worth the work I think though. Slightly brighter lights and a no-load 
on the VW headlight switch.

Just depends which is worth more to you - your time to install the $45 
version or your money to recreate the harness (with much more time).
