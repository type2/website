    As far as I could see, that post was just a religious rant, not some
personal emotional problem -- although I guess some would say that *all*
religious rants are symptomatic of emotional problems, but I'm not one
of those. But then neither am I one who gets seriously upset when
someone suicides, since I feel very strongly that choosing the time and
place of one's death is a personal right and need not be seen as a bad
thing. We all have our moments of doubt and pain, and sometimes the pain
-- whether physical or mental -- becomes greater than the pleasure of
living. 
   I personally like to try to follow the philosophy taught by Yocho
Yamamoto, a Samurai and Zen master from, if I remember correctly, the
16th Century. He said: &quot;Each day when you wake up, look in the mirror,
and say to yourself, 'Today is a good day to die.'&quot;, and always be
prepared to do so. And when you face your enemy, say it again, 'Today is
a good day to die.', and don't worry about preserving your life, for
your life is only a tiny brief second compared to eternity, so what
difference does it make if it is a little shorter?&quot;
    Yocho Yamamoto wrote a book calle the &quot;Hagagure&quot; or &quot;Hidden Leaves&quot;
which later became the handbook for training the Kamikaze pilots of
WWII. Kamikaze is such a beautiful word -- it doesn't mean suicide, as
many think, it means &quot;Spirit Wind&quot; or &quot;Wind of God&quot;. 
    Later, one of the greatest of our Native spiritual leaders Crazy
Horse, taught essentially the same thing -- he taught his people the war
cry &quot;Hoka hey&quot;, which means &quot;Today is a good day to die.&quot;
     So why get uptight about someone's rant -- either for or against?
After all, it is Friday.
    Hoka hey!
