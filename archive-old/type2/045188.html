Also, folks, I have a couple things of my own for sale.  I have a set of
five of the VW special edition &quot;Baja&quot; wheels.  These are spoked 4.5 x 15
steel wheels that will fit Beetle, Super Beetle and Karmann Ghia.  They are
all straight and not rusty.  Need prep and paint.  I'm not sure what they
are worth so make me an offer.  They are located in Fairfax, VA.  See what
