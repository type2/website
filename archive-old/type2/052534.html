Subject: Re: [T2] oil bath on FI air sensor

Wade,
Oil residue from the oil bath air cleaner should never under any
circumstances enter the AFM (FI) or carb.  If it is, someone has really
screwed up and overfilled the hell out of the filter and even then I'm not
sure if it's possible :-)  So even if it's not original it shouldn't be a
problem unless the crankcase breather joins the intake air stream before the
AFM.

The only oily residue that gets into the engine comes from the crankcase
breather.  On FI Buses, for example, the crankcase breather hose joins the
intake air stream AFTER the AFM so no oily residue can get into it and gum
it up.  The breather hose does get introduced upstream of the throttle body
(actually it is introduced in that black rubber S-boot that connects the AFM
to the throttle body on FI Buses) so everything downstream has the potential
to get oily gunk on it.

I have never seen a 411 FI setup in real life but I would imagine it is a
similar design.  Since the 411 first got FI in 1971 I would bet it had an
oil bath filter as VW was still using oil baths as a matter of course back
then.  Did the Type 3's that got FI in 1967 use oil bath or paper element
air cleaners?  I don't know...

By the time Buses got FI in '75 VW had switched over from oil bath air
cleaners to the paper element type.  It's a lot cheaper to make that simple
plastic filter box rather than the heavy steel oil bath container packed
with horsehair.

&gt; Thanks for helping me figure this motor out, guys!  From what I gather, it
&gt; is a 411 setup.  However, did the 411 use an oil bath with the FI airflow
&gt; sensor like this???  Any chance the oil residue could be bad for the
sensor
&gt; if that is not original?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
