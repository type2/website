Subject: Need advice for trip planning

Hi all,

My girlfriend and I are planning our first adventure in our &quot;new&quot; bus.  I 
don't have a lot of experience driving busses long distances, so I'm looking 
for a little advice.  Our bus, a beautiful '70 &quot;deluxe&quot; camper, has a 
completely rebuilt single-port 1600cc engine w/a a new carb, new pistons &amp; 
cylinders, new lifters, a new braking system, and new ball joints and shocks 
(all done by yours truly).  It's been properly broken in.  We are leaving 
from Eugene, OR in said bus and driving to Montana for the month of August, 
then down to Texas via Utah and New Mexico and back to Eugene in September.

I guess I have some concerns driving an antique that far across mountains 
and deserts (we will be doing most of our driving in September).  How well 
do these air-cooled engines operate in desert climates?  How many hours at a 
time can they be driven?  Are there any concerns I should be aware of?  I've 
been following the list for awhile, and I know about cool downs in the 
mountains, and bringing extra parts and what not, is there anybody out there 
w/ experience in touring that could offer some friendly tips?

Thanks, and thanks to the list for help during my rebuild -- my bus runs 
like a charm!
