&gt;Well, I've watched this thread for a week, I guess I'll jump on board!
&gt;I don't disagree with most of what you're saying and I think that by
&gt;free revving to 34-3600 rpm, you'll still have ported vacuum to run the
&gt;vacuum advance (shown as 7.9 inches mercury  on late 76-78 all 2 liters
&gt;and 9.4 inches mercury on 79 Cal 2 liters). The reason for this is that
&gt;at no load the butterfly is not open very far and there's still a lot of
&gt;vacuum.

I think you are confusing manifold vacuum with carb vacuum.  At 3500rpm and
no load there may be a slight bit of carb vacuum, which will provide a
degree or two of vacuum advance, but there will be gobs and gobs of
manifold vacuum, which will provide quite a bit of vacuum retard.  End
result will I'm sure be something less than 40 degrees total advance.

&gt;What I would take issue with, however, is whether under full load, the
&gt;vacuum advance is even functional because under full load the throttle
&gt;butterfly is fully open and the vacuum in the whole intake tract is
&gt;pretty low.

Again, under full throttle carb vacuum (hooked to the advance) will be high
and manifold vacuum (hooked to retard) will be low.  What I've seen is 7+
inches of carb vacuum and 0 inches manifold vacuum under full throttle.
This translates to several degrees of vacuum advance, NO vacuum retard, and
all of the centrifugal advance (assuming 3500rpm).  This is the condition
where you will get the maximum combined advance of well over 40 degrees.

I think I may not have said enough about vacuum before so here's some more:

The type of vacuum can be determined by whether it is drawn from above or
below the throttle butterfly:

                   |   carb (above)      manifold (below)
----------------------------------------------------------
throttle open      |  high              low
                   |
throttle closed    |  low               high

&quot;Carb&quot; vacuum is really &quot;venturi&quot; vacuum.  The venturi is a restriction, or
neck-down (think hourglass-shape) in the body of the carb through which the
air must flow.  When the air flows through the venturi it has to speed up
because of the smaller diameter of the venturi, and you get the &quot;venturi
effect&quot;, which is a pressure drop in the venturi due to the increase in
airspeed.  The carb vacuum port leads into the venturi so when the pressure
drops, air is drawn in from the port and you get vacuum (this same pressure
drop also pulls in the fuel through the main jet).  When the throttle
butterfly closes, the air stops flowing through the venturi, the pressure
drop goes away, and there will be no carb vacuum.

Manifold vacuum is much more simple.  When the engine is turning over the
pistons are continually trying to pull air in through the carburators.
When the throttle butterfly is closed, there is no air to pull except for
the small amount from the manifold vacuum port which is below the
butterfly.  That's why you have high manifold vacuum during decel - the
pistons are furiously &quot;sucking&quot; air through the manifold vacuum port.  When
the butterfly opens, there is so much air coming through the carbs that
none (or very little) is pulled through the manifold vacuum port and thus
the manifold vacuum drops to near zero (there is no venturi effect
(hopefully) in the manifolds).  Also, at say 3500 under no load the
throttle will be almost closed, which means that manifold vacuum will be
high and carb vacuum will be low.

Vacuum (both kinds) is primarily dependent on how far down you have your
foot on the throttle, not how many rpm's the engine is turning.
