To show you how clueless Insurance companies are, when I insured my
previous 1969 bug, I paid about $800 for the year.  About 2 weeks
later, I got a call from them saying that they needed to increase my
rate to $850 because of an error by the previous salescreep.  OK, not
too bad since it was still the cheapest I had seen.  A week later,
another call from the same people.  It seems they had made another
error, and needed to increase my rate to $950.  Now, this was too
high for me.  And the reason?  It seems they thought my 1969
Volkswagen Beetle had Anti Lock brakes!  Hmmm....I don't remember
that option in the literature!
