Subject: Re: [T2] Oil leak

Check the oil pressure sending unit. It is right above the filter.

&gt; Patient: '77 2.0
&gt; Symptom: oil leak
&gt; Location: off oil filter after about 5 minutes running
&gt; Diagnosis: blown oil cooler seals
&gt; 
&gt; Narrative:
&gt; 
&gt; Rapid oil leak.  One drop/sec.  Replaced filter in the vain hope that we
&gt; had a leaker.  Fire it up and after 5 minutes idling we got a leak. 
&gt; Anyone care to venture a second opinion? (Before I pull the effing motor.)
