Good Evening Kiersten,

You don't have much time left to build curtains and get them to your friend
in Arizona before Christmas. You'll have to find a Bus somewhere in your
local area to get measurements off of...(a used car lot?  a friend?)

If my old memory serves me right, it takes 13 yards of material to make all
the curtains for a Bus. Figure twice that amount, if you &quot;line&quot; them.
The Camper has curtain rods screwed to the inside upper window frames,
which you'll soon see if you can get into one. Take Polaroid photos of
everything related to this job for later reference. My 1970 Camper had
elastic, fabric covered &quot;rubber bands&quot; to hold the bottom of the curtains
tightly to the lower window frames. When my wife, Rita, redid them we
used Velcro tabs to secure the curtains in place and junked the rubber
bands. She did mine in a plaid fabric (which was a close match for stock).
and lined them with a flecked gray fabric for more light blockage and
privacy while camping.

All the seams are straight stitched and fairly easy to do on a sewing
machine----but there seems to be MILES of stitching!!!! Make sure that
you don't screw up and get the inside upper pocket on the wrong side of
the curtain, it's a easy mistake to make in the heat of the battle. Mark
each
finished curtain with a small piece of masking tape with the curtain's
position clearly printed on the tape....i.e..  &quot;Right Rear&quot;, &quot;Left Front&quot;,
etc.

Good luck!!!
