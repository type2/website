A REALLY BIG Thanks to all those on the list who responded to my request 
for suggestions regarding starting to do my own repairs on my '79 
Westphalia. I was blown away by the number of replies.(18 and still 
counting)

Almost every one was in agreement over two things...

1). Read the Muir book &quot;How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive, A Manual of 
Instructions for the Compleat Idiot&quot;
2). Repairing your own vehicle is fun &amp; rewarding.

So I have started reading Muir and am enjoying it greatly. Think I will 
start with plugs and points. Eeek!

Les und Das Bus.
