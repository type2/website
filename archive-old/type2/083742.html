Subject: Re: [T2] clutch problem

&gt; I believe Steve is correct. Up to 70 [end of?], the trans does not have the
&gt; tube on the input shaft. On these transaxles you must use a pressure that has
&gt; a ring mounted on it for the throw-out bearing to ride on.
&gt; If he put a 71 and up pressure plate in, he will have a large gap between the
&gt; throw-bearing and the pressure plate that he cannot adjust out.
&gt;
&gt; H.P., does the pressure plate you installed have a ring on it in the center at
&gt; the end of the fingers?

This is exactly my point. The pressure plate and throwout have to match.
I think he mentioned that the clutch does seem to engage at some point
when he tries it manually.
