Subject: pictures and info of 73 westy

I am currently in the process of saving a 73 westy from the junkyard. It's 
intact but I won't be able to get it until Aug 22 when the owner returns 
&gt;from vacation. Would like to do a complete restore but to be honest can't 
guarantee that it's a 73. Any help would be most appreciated.
