&gt; 	George Lyle is right as usual, connect the hose to your

&gt; less water.

Try to avoid using the valve on the water heater, as those valves are
usually made of plastic and can get quite brittle with age.  Better to use
a valve somewhere else in the system that can take the stress.  Break the
water heater  valve and your whole day will be ruined!
