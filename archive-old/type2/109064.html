Subject: Re: [T2] Westy sliding door handle

&gt; Several things that I noted right off the bat.  The Westy design is more
 robust than the `77 bay design that my bus has.  And it has that projection
 on the top.
 Any idea what the projection does?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sounds like you have the 68-73 double-ended handle. It is made that way so you can work the door from the
inside.....68-73 Westies have the sink unit standing behind the pass seat, with very little clearance between
the door and the sink unit with the spice rack/shelf.
