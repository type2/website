Subject: Is It My Gas Cap?

About a week and a half ago, I drove off from the pump without the gas cap for 
my 74.  (Doohp!)

I replaced it with a different one off my '76 that I am working on and not 
driving.

Since then I have had intermitant problems with losing power for while driving 
on the freeway.  The bus will just slow down like it isn't getting gas even 
though I'm on the accelerator. Sort of feels like it is downshifting on its 
own.  If I slow down and downshift to 3rd, it runs fine again and will go 
right into forth and run fine again.

There seems to be no common occurance that causes this &quot;drag&quot;.  I seem to 
remember someone mentioned &quot;vented&quot; gas caps in a post a few days back and got 
to thinking on the way home today that the gas cap is the only thing to change 
on the 74 which has run very admirably until this.

I am going to give it the Muir tune-up tomorrow night and will check/replace 
the fuel filter, and wondered if there is anything else I should look at while 
I'm in there and getting dirty.

Thanks,
