Wherein the author tries to recall as many pertinent details as possible
from the installation of a BN4, late model, into a 1970 Westy, a project
that took 11 months from the time of purchase of the BN4 until it was fired
up for the first time.

December, 1997:
Realizing that if I wanted a BN4 in my Westy there was no better time to put
it in than before I had my rebuilt engine installed, I went online and
searched for a suitable heater. I became quite frustrated in my pursuit
early on because I wasted $175 on a BN4 that the owner neglected to mention
came out of a Thing. Its basically the same model as the Type 2 BN4, with
some significant differences that have to due with mounting and ducting. It
also lacked a proper fuel pump. I tried to sell it to recoup some of my
losses, but no one was buying. There just aren't that many Things out there
to begin with. On the bright side, I now have a parts heater. Moral of this
part of the story: Ask the right questions, like &quot;hey man, is this thing out
of a bus?&quot;

In retrospect, the Thing heater could have been made to work. But I would
have had to fabricated all the ductwork that brings heat into the passenger
compartment, as well as something to mount the heater. I had no idea what
any of these parts looked like, so I figured it was better to get the real
thing.

A glutton for punishment, I went back on line and found a heater for sale,
out of a 72 bus, on the aircooled newsgroup. The price was a bit stiff,
$300, but on the plus side it came from a bus in California, where I assumed
it hadn't been used to death. It was also advertised as &quot;complete.&quot; I bought
it COD, and this time got lucky. It was pretty much as advertised, missing
only two things: the piece that brings the heat out from under the folding
seat/storage compartment in the Westy, and the ductwork to make it a
&quot;recirculating&quot; heater. The former was easily cobbled together with foil
dryer vent hose and a dryer vent face plate, the latter I still would like
to locate or piece together. For you novices out there, the &quot;recirculating&quot;
heater draws its air from inside the bus, just under the driver's side rear
window, heats it and returns it to the bus for a much faster, more efficient
warm up. Anyone that has the recirculating ductwork laying around and would
like to sell them please contact me.

The first step in installing the heater is mounting it. This is easier said
than done, because you've got to get all the holes in just the right places.
If you don't, things won't line up. Ron Van Ness mentioned that he has a
template for cutting the exhaust and intake air holes. If available, I
highly encourage prospective installers to use them. Otherwise, it's
guesswork. And you don't want to be cutting extra holes in your lovely bus.

First I mounted the body of the heater, then cut the exhaust hole using a
hole saw. When I was satisfied that the heater was relatively level and in
the right place, I then measured and cut the hole for the warm air duct into
the passenger compartment using a jig saw with a metal cutting blade.
Accuracy counts here because that duct just barely squeezes by the gas tank.
Get the hole too high or too low, and the duct will interfere with the seam
on the tank. The warm-air duct is relatively large and square. It's tough to
cut out with the rear seat in place (mine was out because I hadn't yet begun
to reassemble the interior of the van from the overall restoration).

A word of caution: It may be theoritically possible to make this cut with
the engine and gas tank in place, but I don't see how. First of all, you'd
have a hell of a time getting a cutting device in there to take a chunk out
of the firewall. Second, an inch or so off when cutting underneath the rear
seat will ventilate your gas tank with all the attendant horrible
consequences that implies.

Finally, after the duct was mounted, I cut the sqaure out of the firewall
for the duct to pass through. Here again, I don't see how this would be
possible if I hadn't removed the engine first. I had to take the firewall in
and out probably 10 times to get the hole sized correctly. Then I mounted
the duct to the firewall. The duct is actually in two pieces--a piece that
mates with the heater and a piece that runs through and underneath the back
seat. The way I handled it, these two pieces come together when I screwed
the firewall back in. That way, I took out as little of the firewall as
possible.

Finally, with the unit successfully mounted, I moved on to other things in
my van restoration, concentrating on getting my engine, tranny and interior
back together for the summer. I reasoned I would not need heat by the time
the van was road worthy, and I was right.

Word of advice: When remounting the gas tank, make sure to hook up that
little brown wire that runs to your gas gauge. Only after I had reinstalled
the firewall and engine and hooked up all the lines and wires did I realize
I had one wire mysteriously left over. Doh! Out came the engine and
firewall...

Summer 1998:
Many happy bus trips, heater not required, painful memories of installation
fade...

Fall 1998:
A nip in the Midwestern air reminded me that I had not yet finished
installing my heater. I had, however, impressed many people at shows and
such by popping the engine hatch and showing off my bright orange heater.
Reaction ranged from &quot;what's that, a turbo?&quot; to &quot;cool BN4 man.&quot; These things
do look like they belong back there.

I pulled the heater out for some bench tests, primarily checking the fuel
pump contact points, but decided against building an elaborate device to
hold the pump steady, feed it fuel and power on the bench. That is what the
bus does, I reasoned. So back in it went.

Once back in I realized I was missing another part: the lower exhaust pipe.
I don't know if BN4s have two- or three-piece exhaust pipes, but mine only
had one. The solution was to fit an exhaust elbow, commonly found at any
auto parts store, to the end of the BN4 exhaust pipe. I muffler clamped the
two together and it seems to work fine, the BN4 exhaust coming out just
behind and above the engine exhaust pipe (stock German muffler).

Next I cut the hole for the combustion air intake pipe. Placement is not as
critical here as the pipe itself is connected to the heater via a flexible
tube. Just be sure to point the pipe toward the engine. If missing, this
would be a very easy piece to fabricate.

Next I wired the beast, using a defroster switch in place of the crapped out
on/off spring-loaded timer switch that came with the heater.

Finally, it was time to fire it up. I strategically located my fire
extinguisher next to the engine compartment. I had never heard one of these
babies run and had no idea what to expect.

I pulled the switch and...nothing. Rechecked the wiring, tightened the
battery connection, pulled the switch again and the reassuring &quot;tick, tick,
tick&quot; that is the BN4's little fuel-pump heartbeat started up, strong and
steady. About a minute later I heard a rumbling noise, like the sound of a
miniature jet lighting off in the engine compartment. And then, heat,
glorious heat! Gobs and oodles of it. More heat than any 10 heat exchangers
ever put into a bus. They call these things &quot;auxillary&quot; heaters, but once
you have one, the heat exchangers become secondary and the BN4 the primary
source of heat.

But all was not well. The heater started smoking profusely, then the fuel
pump mysteriously stopped. Adjusting the fuel pump cured the first problem,
while reading the manual cured the second. It seems that the BN4's
temperature regulating switch works by cutting the fuel pump in and out. I
didn't realize that and panicked when the fuel pump shut off (I had the temp
regulating switch in its lowest position). I feared the worst, but the
heater was doing exactly what it's supposed to.

Epilogue: God knows how long this particular heater had been sitting around
(a decade, maybe two) but it fired up almost immediately and went to work
heating my bus, a testament to the fine engineering that went into the BN4
in the first place.  I now have wonderful, glorious heat. I went camping the
other night and flipped on the old BN4 to take off the morning chill before
getting out of bed. (Don't leave it on too long or it will kill the battery,
though). It's great.

Don't attempt this procedure without the excellent instructions written by
Ron Van Ness and available on the Type 2 home page technical article
section, and on Ron's own web site. Also, a BN4 manual (available online) is
a must-have resource.

Dig in there and get those heaters installed. It's amazing. I now look out
my window and think &quot;maybe I'll take the bus today&quot; even in sub-freezing
weather.

Sorry for being so long winded,
Bob
