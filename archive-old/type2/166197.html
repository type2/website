Yes.

If the big auto makers can make hybrid cars that
works on electric motors from 0-40 MPH and get 35+ MPG with gasoline 
engines. Why haven't they
taken that same platform and substituted an engine like, say the VW TDI 
that gets around 58 MPG
without the use of motors from 0-40 MPH.

The answer as I understand it is cost.  High-tech turbodiesel engines 
are expensive and so are electric drivetrains.  The result would cost 
too much to be economically feasible.  When gas hits $6/gallon, things 
might be different.

I wonder if Mr Kennedy makes an adapter for the TDI engine?

Yes he does.  TDI in a late bay has been done in Germany, but I'm not 
sure if there are any in the US.  There are a couple in Vanagons.
