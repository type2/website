&gt; I gave up trying to find copper nuts in metric size - I lost one out of my
&gt; set of four - I had to use a stainless one as a replacement -I'd like to
&gt; know where you get the copper ones from!

&gt;
&gt; There are copper nuts available that wouldn't rust - those would be my
&gt; first choice.  Whatever type you use, put lots of anti-sieze on the studs
&gt; before you install them and don't overtighten.  If you want to be sure you
&gt; don't have problems in the future, remove the nuts every year, clean
&gt; everything and reapply the anti-sieze.
