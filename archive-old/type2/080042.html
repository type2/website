Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Fill Hose, Filler neck to tank 72-79 Bus HELP!

Take the metal pipe section to NAPA (or you preferred store) - that's what 
I had to do.

Sorry I don't remember the size - has been 2 or 3 years since I did that 
job. Won't take very long. Will also give you a good chance to check the 
elbow at the top - they all need inspection and most need replacing.

I'll be taking a close look in a few months when the bus goes back on the 
road.

&gt;Thats what I figured I would have to do. I looked at it and got the panel
&gt;out of the way. I initially suspected vent l;ines so they are all new. Do
&gt;you happen to know the diameter of hose you used? I don't have a lot of
&gt;time after work to mess with it and wanted to use the bus this weekend to
&gt;go camping.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again,

&gt;The lower hose is the easy one - I'll suggest that you do it with the
&gt;engine out but it can be done with some cussing with the firewall out.
&gt;Disconnect and remove the battery (batteries). No sparks desired with open
&gt;gas tanks. Aircooled drivers and aircooled busses are in short supply
&gt;already...
&gt;
&gt;The hose material can be obtained from a marine supplier (who sells boats
&gt;there locally?), a diesel repair shop, or NAPA (or the equivalent
&gt;professional parts store).
&gt;
&gt;There are plenty of cooling hoses that will fit but I suggest you buy hose
&gt;rated for fuel.
&gt;
&gt;Seems like mine only required about a 20 degree bend and I was able to fit
&gt;a straight hose with a slight bend in it. I added hose clamps (I don't
&gt;think mine had clamps originally).
&gt;
&gt;While you are at it replace ALL of the vent hoses and fuel hoses, they are
&gt;easy to get to right now. It probably needs it anyway...
