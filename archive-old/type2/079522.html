Subject: Re: [T2] Paint question...

There are some hydrogen peroxide activated paint removers that might work.  
They have been designed for use on aircraft, but the results should be 
similar.  They will be more forgiving on steel than an acid activated 
stripper.  Not much odor for the peroxides either.
