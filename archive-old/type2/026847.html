Hi Volks,
   I'm going to equip our 71 westy with a fire extinguisher.  I'm going to 
do it not because I expect to need it, but because you never know when you 
might need it.
   I assume (and you know how foolish that can be) that I need an 
extinguisher rated for A B and C type fires.  But I'm wondering two things.  
First is what kind of extinguishing agent should I get, and the second is 
what size should I have on hand?  Is bigger always better when it comes to 
this?

PS: my fuel lines are all new, how about you?
