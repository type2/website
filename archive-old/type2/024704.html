I have recently dealt with my starter and upon removal and 
disassembly/cleaning did not find any sort of a bushing, 
either in the bellhousing or on the shaft. The end of the shaft
seems to fit nicely in a bored hole in the bellhousing. Your 
description said &quot;the starter turns, but  won't turn the engine 
over&quot;  does this mean everything sounds normal and the 
engine won't start? Or the starter is spinning without 
turning the engine?  If the starter is spinning without 
engaging the flywheel it would not sound normal. This would 
be very strange considering the solenoid has to function 
correctly (engage shaft with flywheel) in order to close the 
contacts that drive the starter motor.
When you say &quot;sometimes if it won't start i put the car in 
gear and push it a bit, then sometimes it starts&quot;, this sounds 
like the shaft is stuck in the flywheel, in this case, you would 
hear nothing when turning the key.

Hope this gives you some more ideas to troubleshoot.
