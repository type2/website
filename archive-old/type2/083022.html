Subject: Re: [T2] Casper Update &amp; Questions

Here's my take.

AA)  Clutch differences

Old style (I assume you mean three finger)
New style (I assume you mean the 18 finger)

Three-finger is the original design.  Because there
are only three fingers, each is very strong, meaning
that more pedal pressure is required.  The 18 finger
applies equal pressure across the entire clutch plate,
leading to smoother clutch performance.  To tell you
the truth, I haven't seen a new three-finger plate is
years.  If given a choice, definitely go 18 finger.

BB)  Main seal

If yours is going bad as quickly as you claim, you
probably have a bigger problem.  Quickly though, there
are many manufacturers.  I use only the German made
Elring - these are black with a red ring on the
inside.  The overall construction is cleaner and feels
more durable than the Brazilian made seals.

Back to your leak.  When you install your flywheel, be
sure to use very fine emery cloth (around 300 grit)
with oil to finely polish the surface of the flywheel
which contact the seal.  If not polished, it will lead
to premature seal leakage.  Also, check your end play.
 Too much endplay beats the seal, also leading to
premature leakage.

&gt; Hello List,
&gt; 
&gt; Went to work on Casper yesterday, and got the
&gt; damaged section all cut out.
&gt; Will do clean up grinding today and start to fit in
&gt; the new tin so as to 
&gt; properly place for weldment.
&gt; 
&gt; Discovered a few things that were surprising, as
&gt; always seems to happen 
&gt; when you work on something old, but no major
&gt; heartburn to be had, and I am 
&gt; going to be happy that I am repairing the big guy
&gt; properly.
&gt; 
&gt; While Casper's engine is out, I will do a teardown
&gt; to the degree I feel 
&gt; necessary, and do those inspections and component
&gt; changes that support 
&gt; Casper's engine having a continued high probability
&gt; of making more long 
&gt; mileage and long time frame trips without incident.
&gt; 
&gt; Question(s):
&gt; 
&gt; AA)
&gt; Clutch in Casper is of the &quot;new&quot; design.
&gt; The one I just put in NewBus was of the &quot;old&quot;
&gt; design.
&gt; Might someone point me to info that will allow me to
&gt; understand the 
&gt; benefits of one vs the other?
&gt; 
&gt; BB)
&gt; Main seal in Casper leaks. I seem to be replacing it
&gt; every time I pull the 
&gt; engine because of that dern thing always having just
&gt; a small leak.
&gt; Beyond proper installation, is there some specific
&gt; seal source that is 
&gt; better than others?
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I am wondering about the possibility of
&gt; obtaining a seal from some 
&gt; manufacturer that might be better selected if given
&gt; an opportunity to 
&gt; choose same.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there more than one &quot;brand&quot; of seal, and if so,
&gt; which brand is preferred?
&gt; I seem to recall the original seal in Casper being
&gt; black.
&gt; The ones I have been putting in were red, as I
&gt; recall, as but one example 
&gt; to illustrate that &quot;some&quot; aspects of &quot;identical&quot;
&gt; components might differ.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you so very much list for
&gt; continuing to be being such a great source of
&gt; comradery info,
&gt; .
