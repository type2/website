&gt; I have a 1979 bus which sounded great until I set it on jacks for 3

Probably.

&gt; I drove down the road and back but still noisy.

How far down the road?  A drained lifter can take up to 20 minutes to pump
back up.  If &quot;down the road&quot; was the same as &quot;around the block&quot; then try
letting the bus idle for 20 minutes or so.  Bring a book along and sit in
it and read.

&gt; I beleive the 79 has hydraulic lifters

It did when it was new.  Who knows what it has today?  From the complaint
I would say that you still do have them.

&gt; so what can I do.

Let the bus idle for 20 minutes then replace the lifter if it still has
not pumped up.

&gt; thanks

You are welcome.

                             OOK!
