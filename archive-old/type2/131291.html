Subject: Need info on VDO tach

I have a 68 Westy and I am looking to install a tachometer in the gauge
cluster. The spot to the right of the speedo
is empty and I believe a 3 1/8&quot; tach will fit. Does anyone know if a VDO
333-032  for 4 cyl 7000RPM  tach that does measure 3 1/8th work properly?
