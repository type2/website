Subject: Fuel Lines
Date: Tue, 23 Mar 1999 00:19:52 -0500 (EST)

List-
This is an old subject that I just wanted to bring up again now that Bus
season is beginning.
At the bottom of the type2 web page it says: &quot;Buses are prone to fires.
Replace and clamp your fuel lines now!!!&quot;
I had planned to do this on one of my busses as soon as a warm day came
along. I was also inspired by the note from one of our former list members
who was selling off what was left of his bus after a very unfortunate
accident and fire when repairing a fuel leak.
I had a good warm day last week. With very little fuel in the tank and the
positive (+) side of the battery disconnected and a fire extinguisher near
by, I went to work. I don't know how old the lines were but they looked
fine. I pulled on the line to the fuel pump and it tore off. They were the
German cloth lines and were not clamped at the carbs where they came off
too easily. Whenever I have had fuel lines fail or break in my hands it has
been those cloth wound fuel lines. They seem to dissolve and become
brittle with age but they remain flexible and look just fine. They also
tend to crack on the ends. In my opinion the regular (non-German) fuel line
seems to hold up much better. On the oldest junk busses I've looked at and
taken parts off of, those regular fuel lines seem to hold up better over
time. This is just my opinion. I went to the FLAPS and got standard fuel
line and clamps for all connections. I feel much better with this setup.
If your fuel lines are old, replace them. If you don't know how old they
are, replace them. The parts are cheap and if the old lines fail it could
be a real disaster.
I am sorry to preach at all of you but I feel that I have now done my duty.

Thank You
