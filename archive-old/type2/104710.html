&gt; The Coleman &quot;Sport Cat&quot; puts out about 1000 BTU and is way too undersized to

&gt; I recently took a little trip to the east coast and discovered this through
&gt; trial and error. Cabin temp was 36 F on the way up after 4-5 hours of
&gt; sleeping with the heater running and 46 F on the return trip sleep over...
&gt;
&gt; So, I suggest getting a heater with at least 3000 BTU heating capacity if
&gt; you want to be comfortable in cold weather bus camping. (Coleman Black Cat _at_
&gt; $50)

Even the 3000BTU heater is marginal.  In electric terms it is about 800W,
a bit less than a cheap blow dryer.

My ProCat 3000BTU heater was good for taking the chill off in Havasu, but
I wouldn't count on it to heat a bus in really cold conditions.
