Subject: RE: [T2] h4 headlights

&gt; Hey Ron,
&gt; How are the Bosch ones?  Also, I noticed that you noted that 
&gt; they need bulbs.  Do you have a link to the correct bulbs for 
&gt; the bosch lights?  &gt; I'd like to get a pair.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, like you mentioned, they're not street legal - why is 
&gt; this?  Are they obnoxiously bright?  They do have 
&gt; normal/bright lights, right?


The bulbs are at this link:

You can also get them at most auto parts stores.

Yes, they do have normal/bright lights; they just drop in the same as the
stock sealed-beams and take the same headlight connector. 

H4's are commonly used as street headlights in many countries, but most do
not have U.S. DOT approval, without which they cannot legally be used
on-road in the States. (The same can be said of the headlights on virtually
any vehicle built for sale outside of the U.S.) The fluting on the lens
varies from brand to brand and some may be more suitable for road use than
others. The Bosch are considered among the best H4's available. Speaking as
a bus owner, I have driven buses that had the Bosch H4's and never had
anyone flash their brights at me. But speaking as a merchant, I cannot
advise anyone to use any part for an application for which it is not
officially DOT approved. If you wanted to play it safe, the Hellas on that
page are DOT approved, come with bulbs, and are still an improvement over
the stock sealed-beams.

One installation note, for those who are unaware: Any halogen bulb
(including those found on most modern cars) can be damaged by contact with
your fingers.  The oil from your fingers gets on the element, and when the
bulb heats up, the oil overheats the bulb surface and burns it out.  When
installing halogen bulbs, be sure to touch the bulb only at the socket (or
wear gloves).
