The real test is San Francisco.  I have only driven there one time without a
working ebrake -- never again.  Anyhow, lets move on.

I've heard, or maybe read, that the best way to adjust your rear brakes is
to loosen up the ebrake cables first.  Any opinions, pro or con?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Which brings me onto hill starts! Using the handbrake for 
&gt; &gt; setting off is NOT cheating!!!! It's the correct way to do
&gt; &gt; it. You should never ride the clutch when stationary to
&gt; &gt; hold position and trying to do some fancy footwork to
&gt; &gt; avoid putting it on when setting off is just daft.
&gt; 
&gt; What people don't realize is that there is very little to no difference
&gt; between putting your foot on the brake and letting out the clutch until
&gt; rpm drops before you move your foot from the brake to the gas versus using
&gt; the ebrake.  You'll still engage the clutch ever so slightly before you
&gt; let go of the ebrake lever so it's really all relative to your preferred
&gt; choice of driving styles.  There really is no right and wrong here.
&gt; Either method can get you into trouble with burnt clutches if you aren't
&gt; fast enough.  I've driven my 1974 Super Beetle this way for over 30,000
&gt; miles and I still have a good clutch.  Matter of fact, I've never had to
&gt; adjust it since I put it in.  What does that tell ya about good clutching?
