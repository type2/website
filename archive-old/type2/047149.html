&gt; sorry to have to repost this but it's getting cold out and I need to get
&gt; my bus on the road.  I need a front tranny mount for my '74 westy.  I
&gt; have switched for auto to manual.  If anyone knows of any junk yards in
&gt; MD or VA that might have this I would really appreciate the info.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Frankie
