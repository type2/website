Subject: Re: [T2] Cleaning the oil breather hose

I've adjusted it on the coldest day so flaps are fully closed and 
thermostat is fully compressed and so &quot;stretch&quot; is out of cable.  Then 
check on hot day to verify flaps are fully released. I believe there is 
a &quot;maximum&quot; temp where the thermostat is still fully closed and warmer 
than that, it begins to open.  I'm sure Karl knows the specs. Easy to 
check with a water bath and a thermometer.  I'd think it's less accurate 
doing it when hot (harder to remove stretch from cable) unless you can 
verify by measurment it is fully open (stretched).  That requires more 
neck stretching than the former method (-8

  thermostat cools it will pull them closed.

  How warm is warm? Any highway drive for 15 minutes should open them
  up fully. I'm not sure about sub-zero temps.
