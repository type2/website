From: Sam Shimek &lt;1trader_at_airmail_dot_net&gt;
Subject: FS: Nice '71 Westy
Mime-Version: 1.0

THE GOOD:

No rust, except  in battery tray and under a couple of window sills, not
major.
New rebuild on '69 dual port motor.
New steering box
New ball joints
New KYB shocks
New brake job
New canvas and seal on poptop
New paint on outside
Starts first crank everytime
Runs good, gets about 20 mpg at 60 mph

THE BAD:

interior hasn't been redone yet:  it's usable, but not beautiful.
no appliances (I like it better without them--you may not)
3 or 4 bondo places, not deep
The paint job is Earl Scheib
I broke off the rear hatch latch
stickers are out of date

That's about it:  if you want to see it, just call first at
817-738-6761(new phone number) or e-mail to 1trader_at_airmail_dot_net.  It's in
Fort Worth.

Cheers,
Sam
