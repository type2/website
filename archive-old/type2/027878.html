&gt;Ever seen one of these things on fire?
(68-71 cases)

Yep..3 of them last night at High Country Bus Festival. Scary part: only 
took a wood fire to light them off. Second scary part?: breathing western NC 
air for the next week:)

Did make me even more wary of overheating an engine. Would really hate to 
see one lit off in-situ.

And:....nice job on the festival, Budda!

Marv Krupp..who's NOT going to buy that 58 SC (junker) he looked at in 
Asheville friday..that's a first!!
