  distributors...

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I have a low mileage 2.0L engine, that has sat as a
&gt; long block for, oh, six
&gt; or seven years, and I got around to getting it all
&gt; suited back up and
&gt; installed.  I  fired it up and of course, the
&gt; hydraulic lifters were
&gt; deflated and clattering.  I was anticipating this. 
&gt; I know from before, the
&gt; valves were adjusted to 1 1/2 to 2 turns in, and I
&gt; have not  touched them
&gt;
The lifter question was dealt with about 1-2 weeks
back. Seems that those who agreed on anything were in
favor of adjusting about a single turn and not the 2,
but definitely not none and run the engine at about
2000 rpm for twenty minutes... No disassembling and
pumping up required. -BaH
