&gt; Howdy List,
&gt;         I purchased a new 1600 case for a rebuild in my 1970 Bus, this
&gt; is only my 2nd VW rebuild so I have a few questions not covered in the
&gt; standard manuals.
&gt; 1.  Those gasket kits we get from the standard vendors some pieces seem
&gt; real thin (ie. the paper cylinder gaskets between the cylinder and the
&gt; case)  are they supposed to be that thin or should I reinforce with a
&gt; home made gasket?
&gt; 2.  Do you recommend using adhesive when sealing the 2 halves of the
&gt; case together or are the machined surfaces enough?
&gt;                         Thank you in advance,           Dan

I've heard (Muir, I think) that a bit of GaskaCinch and a single sewing
thread (like a Coats &amp; Clark, white) will seal it better than anything. 
The thread squishes out and becomes about 1/4 inch wide, looks like a
bit of plastigauge when you take it apart again, but I never had a leak
doing that way.  Sounds weird, but it works.

And you don't need any more than the tiny paper gaskets, unless you put
in the shims to reduce compression (see &quot;deck height&quot; in the archives).
