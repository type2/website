Alternate location instead of drilling sheet metal is to attach the 
gizmo to the screw that holds the starter together.  I carefully 
removed the long screw, attached my Ford solenoid  &amp; wired it up on 
the bench, and had to bend the tang on the solenoid to clear the deck 
lid after installation though.  Sad that we still need solenoids, 
even on such a 'new' bus as an '80 *sigh*.
