Subject: Bus values 

      Where is the best place to find a value for my 70' Kombi?
Kelly blue book _dot_com doesn't go back far enough to cover it,
and I hear that other sources have raised their values a bit.
 The information is for my divorce case, so the higher prices
are not to my advantage.

 Thanks, Jak
