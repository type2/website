Subject: tuned exhaust manifold for type 4's?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Looking at the header and exhaust tubing on the 911 engine, I realize that
the designers made a big effort to keep the exhaust tubing length the same
for all cylinders until they merge into the muffler. I take it this has
something to do with evening out backpressure across the cylinders and,
perhaps, also to smooth out the flow to the collector pipe. (?)

Has anyone seen this type of setup on a type4-powered bus? Could the
headers (i.e., the pipes before the heat exchangers be replaced with a more
sophisticated setup?

Sami
