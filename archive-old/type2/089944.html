OK, I just thought I heard that dropped/pounded seats were
not rebuildable, but I can't remember who told me that or
where I may have heard it.  That's promising, as I think
one of my heads has the typical exhaust valve problem, or
possibly a similar problem as Troys, I figured I may have
to buy a new one (2 liter FI) as a worst case.

&gt; Sure they can---

&gt; With a set of hardened seats and sodium valves, those heads would be
&gt; bullet proof!!=20

&gt; Looks like the engine that head came off of was run hard and=20
&gt; put out wet=20
&gt; to dry---=20
&gt;=20
&gt; Them seats aren't dropped, they are pounded out !!=20
&gt;=20
&gt; So that head can't be rebuilt, right?=20
