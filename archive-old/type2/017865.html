     While driving home last night I was trying to figure out what
&quot;blind spot&quot; the closet causes. I sure don't see one -- you have to turn
your head far too much to even see the cabinet, and while you're doing
that, you sure aren't paying attention to what's happening ahead of you.
I see just fine with my regular mirror and the window in the sliding
door.
