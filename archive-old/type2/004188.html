I had the same problem with my 71.  Got some regular screws, nuts and
washers from the hardware store - 6-32 or 8-32 IIRC.  Buy the stainless if
they have them.  The screws are inserted through the holes in the lens and
housing (maybe I had to drill holes in the housing - it's been a long time
and I don't remember), then through the holes in the body of the bus (I did
not drill out the holes in the body).  While holding a screwdriver in the
screw head, reach inside the engine compartment (you'll probably have to
remove the battery on the right side), slip on a washer and thread on a nut,
tighten the screw, and you're done.  Yeah, it's a bit of a pain, and it may
take two people if your arms are short, but how often will you need to do
this?

its me again.

the little rectangular shaped side markers are held onto the body
of my bus with little small plastic clips.  recently, one of the clips
broke.  had anyone found a way to replace those clips?

i'd like to find a way to fix this, instead of ordering a
new housing. kinda pricey.

TIA.
