&gt; 3. The wider tread of the 195- tire puts more stress on the steering
&gt; box when the wheels are turned with the bus stationary.  Steering
&gt; boxes are expensive to replace.  Contrary to the popular notion, wide
&gt; tires do not offer more traction than narrow tires except under
&gt; conditions where the tires are subject to frictional heating such as
&gt; in a sports car.  Buses are about as far from a sports car as you can
&gt; get!


    I don't use wider tires for &quot;sports car&quot; handling, but for off road
in mud and sand they sure make a difference. And a camper is definitely
a back road vehicle. The bigger tires are also load rated much higher --
my 225's are rated at 1840 lbs per, which means they should last much
longer as well. 
    I'd be very surprised if the wider tires even slightly affected the
life of the steering box, and if so, it'd be so little that I'm sure I
can afford it as the price to pay for not getting stuck nearly as often.
And as far as wear and tear on the bus is concerned, getting buried in a
mud or sand hole down to the frame, plus all the revving, rocking back
and forth, etc. is very hard on the whole driveline. I'd much rather
replace the steering box slightly earlier, if indeed that were actually
the case.
