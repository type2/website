&gt; 
&gt; &gt;- VW Nose Logo Replacement: Giacomo's is missing,
&gt; and until I find a tire
&gt; &gt;mount for him. I'm toying with a few ideas for a
&gt; non-VW replacement for the
&gt; &gt;missing logo....
&gt; 
&gt; How 'bout a bare breasted female figure, as found on
&gt; the front of olden 
&gt; sailing ships?
&gt; Used to tame the sea, perhaps it would have a
&gt; similar effect on traffic???
