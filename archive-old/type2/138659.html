Subject: RE: [T2] AVP Head

Doesn't sound right but anything is possible. Pull the retainers off of 
bothe exhaust valves and check both to see if they feel the same. Put some 
oil in there and see if there is a difference. You might want to try lapping 
that valve while it is out.

Good Luck,

&gt;I've got a new AVP head that's leaking down 50% on the exhaust valve. I've 
&gt;got some grave concerns about install it and hoping it will fix itself.

&gt;The best suggestion I've heard so far is that the valve guide maybe tight 
&gt;and after breakin the valve will seat properly. Opinions?
