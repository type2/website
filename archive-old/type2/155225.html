Subject: Re: [T2] spark plugs

Hi James,

When are we getting together for coffee?

I wouldn't worry too much about the carbon in the tailpipe - most
vehicles that are mainly driven on short trips have that - there's a
fair bit of time warming up while it's running rich.

If you search the archives, you'll see a few opinions on platinum plugs...

I've got a cylinder head temperature gauge.  It's easy to install.
You could probably also find plenty of reading material in the
archives on adding oil temperature gauges and what the best cylinder
head temperature gauges are.
