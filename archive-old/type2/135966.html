Subject: Attention Bus Club T-shirt Collectors!!

Hey Guys\Gals, I am doing the annual run of tshirts
for my local bus club, the Ohio Valley Tribe of the
Full Moon Bus Club, and as always I want to offer
these tshirts to everyone on the T2 and VB lists as
well, because I know there are at least some of you
out there with Bus Tshirt fetishes!    ALSO, FOR EVERY
SHIRT SOLD TO T2 OR VB LISTMEMBERS AS A RESULT OF THIS
EMAIL, I WILL DONATE $1 PER SHIRT TO THE LIST
TREASURY.  Anyway, here's the info I sent to OVT
Members:

Allright guys, daddy needs a new pair of converse, so
I am now taking orders for the BRAND NEW 2004 Ohio
Valley Tribe Un-official club tshirt!!  
The NEW shirt graphic is modeled after the classic
M*A*S*H TV show tshirts, they will be printed on Army
green t-shirts.  If you are too young to know what
the TV show  M*A*S*H is, then ask one of the old
farts!
Tshirts will cost $12 per shirt
for any size up to XL, add $1 per &quot;X&quot; for anything
larger than XL. I can ship shirts anywhere in the U.S.
or Canada for $3.95 for up to 2 shirts, or $5.95 for 3
or more.  My preferred method of payment is
PayPal and my ID there is harmony_at_buszen_dot_com , but you
can also send me a money order. I will take orders
from now through November 15, shirts will then be
shipped the first week of December and they will and
in your grubby
little hands in plenty of time for Christmas!! Email
me to place your order, go to this link to view the
graphic:
