Subject: Re: [T2] Wood Interior

&gt;	I am thinking of doing a wood interior for my 71 bay window bus. Does 
&gt;anyone have any clues where I can start.

I dont know anything about it personally, although my interests have been 
perked as of late ...

I dont want to volunteer this guy to help you, I don't even know him, but 
I'm pretty sure he's a list member and maybe he's willing to give you a 
pointer.  Check out his bus:

It's totaly beautiful inside ... !

Good luck bro,
- Ian Bridwell
