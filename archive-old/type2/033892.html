&gt; &gt;Heat and a hammer in the right hands will do a lot. (It will also booger

&gt; &gt;experience.) :^(
&gt; &gt;Glad you got your ball joints in successfully, though!
&gt; 
&gt; Al is 100% right I was going to mention it myself, impact is an impressive
&gt; thing, does what continuous force can't even imagine, something about
&gt; mass acceleration and conservation of momentum and all.
&gt; Big ole hammer can do it pretty well usually and as you seldom are saving
&gt; the ball joints, doesn't ususally matter if you just want the eccentric off.  If
&gt; you do leave the nut on but put it all the way down just flush even with the joint
&gt; that way you tend not to smear the treads or do them incredible damage, but
&gt; they are fine and can take a hell of a whump anyway.

John: 
As long as I started this... I should mention... put a big fat glove on
your hand first when working in close quarters with immoveable objects.
That big ole fat hammer will help  remove the skin right down to the
bone if it meets one of those immoveable objects! I just hate to see
that white tissue inside my greasy fingers! (It has happened many
times!)
Also, a 2-lb hammer is much more effective than a 16 oz. and never use a
nail-pounding hammer- it's hardened and its face could chip off into an
eye.
