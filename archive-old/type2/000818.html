Matt,
Look for vacuum leaks. The fact that it dies after running for a couple of
minutes suggests that it may be dying when the aux air valve closes. A
slight vacuum leak might idle ok with the aux air valve open but may be too
lean to run once it closes. (The aux air valve provides additional air - and
hence fuel - while the engine warms up).

However, now it sounds like your engine won't fire at all. So:
-Look for potential vacuum leaks - always.
-Check head temp sensor. Losen and re-snug to make sure it is grounding ok.
-Check for any loose connections in the wiring harness. Don't forget the 2
ground wires that attach to the spade connection that is attached to one of
the case bolts in the middle of the top of the engine.
- Try a replacement AFM if you can get your hands on one.

I had a very similar problem before I embarked on an 8 week cross country
journey in 1997. My engine always started, but it ran poorly until
*completely* warmed up. At idle it would barely stay alive. I tried testing
each component - but to no avail. I finally put a scope on an injector
signal at idle. When the engine was running ok, the pulse to the injector
was 'thus' wide. When it was running poorly, the pulse to the injector was
much narrower and flakey. Since my head temp sensor seemed ok, and I didn't
have any vacuum leaks, I assume my problem was an intermittent problem with
AFM, Brain, or Wiring Harness.

I never found the problem - and I needed to leave in less than a week. I
ordered a Weber progressive mail order (I don't remember the name of the
place - they sell lots of carbs - advertise in VW Trends/HotVW - Performance
Products?) $199 for the complete kit (for a '77), another $25 for an
electric fuel pump. I run with the stock vacuum/centrifugal dizzy - the carb
has a connection for this. My bus runs GREAT - but it runs like it has a
carb - hesitation, needs warming up, etc.

Once you've got your bus running nice on a carb you don't have to worry too
much about problems on the road - just keep a carb re-build kit under your
bench seat. Having these FI problems at home is one thing - on the road they
would be a major pain in the ass - 1000 miles into Mexico and you might as
well kiss your bus good-bye.

Nonetheless, nothing beats FI for drivability - no hesitation, no cold
weather problems, great reliability (?). I still have my complete FI system
and plan on putting it back on (someday). I plan  on setting the system up
on a bench and trying to find the intermittent problem. Nonetheless, I'll
keep the Weber Kit boxed up and tucked away in the aux battery side of my
engine compartement - especially on road trips - especially especially on
Mexican road trips.

I hope I haven't waffled too much on this issue - I know you're are looking
for advice. My advice - spend as much time as you can trying to get the FI
working.  Get a Weber kit lined up. Get shipping info etc so you know when
you have to order it by. If the drop dead date comes and the FI is still not
working, order the Weber and concentrate on getting it working - forget the
FI.

Have a great trip one way or the other. Don't let the FI nazis on the list
keep you from making an objective decision - you've probably seen some
people on the list fiddle with their flaky FI endlessly - don't make that
mistake. *Using* your bus to travel is what it's all about.

Good luck and let us know what happens,
