Subject: Re: [T2] lOOKING FOR A STOCK TACH OR CLOCK FOR A 70 TRANSPORTER

Rick, and list----

Saw one at a VW show last  summer---

And I know a gentleman, that has, for sale, as we speak, a type 2,
factory issue, from VW, to fit in the third hole to the right in the
dash, tachometer---I don't think it is going to be cheap, or even
resonable---
But they are out there-----

If anyone wants it--P-mail me, and I'll hook you up with him ( or It
)---:&gt;)


Later,

Terry

 
E-mail message From Rick=A0Bailey 

If they even made stock tachometers for buses, it's news to me. I'd love
to have one that matches the stock equipment; right now I've got some
aftermarket device that doesn't quite fit in, so sticks awkwardly out of
the dash rather than being set in. Still, it works, so if you care more
about having a tach than knowing what time it is, you can always settle
for something that doesn't quite match, or fit, but does the job.
