&gt; Okay, am i crazy or were you guys talking about removing the torque converter
&gt; from the flexplate mounted to the crank?  The hole in the case on the upper
&gt; left towards the front - thats what its for - removing TC bolts.  Did i miss
&gt; something?

Nope, you didn't miss anything, but that bloody hole is the hardest thing
in the world to use, especially if you are alone.  about the only thing I
do with it is use it to torque the bolts down and/or break them free.

and be VERY carefull with your fingers, if you turn the crank to fast with
your fingers in there they will be calling you &quot;Nine&quot;

&gt; &gt; I loosen the engine and pull it back about a half inch so there is a small
&gt; &gt; gap between the engine and tranny, then go into that gap with a flat bike
&gt; &gt; wrench, 13mm (about $5 at a bike shop)
