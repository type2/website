Subject: Re: FS: Baja Bus, Volksota? or Toyobus?

I've had a couple of requests to expound on the existence, 
configuration, and general 'what's dat?' type questions about a 
BAJA Bus.  Well here goes:
Envision a Baja Bug, transmogrified into a bus:
Wheel wells have been cut a lot bigger, larger tires, raised 
suspension, earlier bus axles (greater clearance with gear boxes) 
sometimes.  Usually a larger, more powerful engine installed. 
Generally looks beat up.  The kind of vehicle that when a 
collision occurs, usually loses, but owner doesn't care.
I could be wrong, I haven't actually seen this bus, could be in great 
shape, but probably still have the modifications though.
NOT for the 'complete restoration' type of person.

BTW did a spell check on this post, 'transmogrified' did NOTshow up 
as a mispelled word! This software stuff never ceases to amaze me!
