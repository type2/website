Subject: Re: [T2] Later front disc brakes in a 70 bus?

--------------09E0836381A8432AC9C802B3

Tim, das Kapitan:
Well, there's also the matter of a proportioning valve for the rear. And two
different spare wheels if you don't change the rears.
Actually, the only parts in the front that are different are the spindles and
the hubs and a bracket on the beam for the booster.
Still, it all adds up to a lot of work.

&gt; for sure, but it would be suprizing to me if you couldn't bolt in a
&gt; complete beam from any later T-II. Yes you would have to update the MC,
&gt; maybe add or reroute lines, and put a port on the intake to run to the
&gt; booster. Rear brakes should be fine when the lines follow the MC's lead.
