    That is the wrong stuff. There is a self adhesive product that has a slick up
side. It is used to prevent Ice damming, and to seal holes when awnings are
installed (which is where I saw it). You can also see it being used on Bob Villa's
shows, and on Hometime... and I still can't remember what it is called... It is
flexible, waterproof, stays flexible at sub zero temps,  and does not emit noxious
odors...
