Here's a possible solution, but it doesn't exactly fit.
There could still be a restriction in the breather, however.

&gt; I was driving my 70 westy home from work tonight. Just after I got to the
top
&gt; of a pretty good hill, I happened to look in the rear view mirror to see
what
&gt; sort of a line had accumulated behind me. Instead I saw a bunch of blue
gray
&gt; smoke. Doh!!
&gt; I drove the last block home and planted my self in the ground. There was
oil
&gt; dripping onto the brace that runs below the engine. The drip was mostly in
the
&gt; center (left/right) of the car. There was still a little bit of smoke
coming
&gt; from the muffler, so maybe some oil got there too.
&gt;
&gt; What did I do, and more importantly, what will I be doing this weekend to
&gt; fix?? In case it matters, I was doing about 25-30 up the hill in third,
which
&gt; has never been a problem before.
