If your engine doesn't ping on regular, then higher octane gas is a waste
of money.  There are a couple of things to consider though, such as,

1)  When your engine first starts to ping it will be so faint you will
probably not notice it.  Be very sure this isn't happening.

2)  Some premium fuels have more/better additives than the lower octanes.
This could be a reason to spend the extra $.  Not for me though.

My engine doesn't ping even with 86 octane gas, 15 degrees BTDC timing, 100
degree heat, and steep hills.  Thank the .060&quot; spacers under my cylinders,
which lower compression but cost me some horsepower and efficiency.  No
free lunch.
