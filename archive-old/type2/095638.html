Subject: RE: [T2] pop-up tent replacement

&gt; According to the website, www.plfvw_dot_com, these are the exact
&gt; reasons that Dawn decided to build a better poptop canvas.


Dawn's canvas is Sunbrella acrylic, like the acrylic option that I offer,
and with the same advantages and drawbacks that I noted before.  While she
is not the only source for Westfalia poptop canvas (obviously), she is the
only one I know of who makes replacement canvas for such American
conversions as Sportsmobiles and Rivieras. At one time I sold them, and was
impressed both with her product and the pride she took in it.  The reason I
stopped selling them was that at that time (a couple of years ago) there was
some very well publicized complaints from people who had ordered directly
from her, paid in advance, and didn't get their orders (see the list
archives).  Apparantly there were some personal issues that caused the
delays, and as I recall she eventually made good on all of the orders,
either by delivering or refunding.  I really don't feel that there was ever
any conscious intent to rip anyone off.  Rather, this is the downside of
being a one man (or woman) operation, in that when non-work-related problems
come up that distract you, there's no one else to &quot;mind the store&quot; while you
deal with life's little surprises.  (I was in that position myself when I
first started the Depot, so I can relate!)  I couldn't say from firsthand
knowledge whether that situation has improved, but after all this time I
would hope/assume so.
