The other day I dropped my son off at school.  I went to start my Bus
and the starter spun for about a half a second, then nothing.  I
crawled underneath, checked the connection pulled the solenoid wire
off and put it back on incase a bad connection and still nothing.  So
to get to work I used needle nose pliers on the starter/solenoid and
it started up.  At lunch time I moved the solenoid wire from one of
the male connectors on the solenoid to the other and it started right
up.  I thought they were connected together?  Are they?  I would have
thought if it was a bad connection then by pulling the wire off and
putting it back on it would have fixed that problem.

Next question, I replaced my extractor the other day but kept my
muffler (glasspak).  The extractor had severl rust holes but the
muffler looked fine.  It's still louder then when I first got my Bus
so can a muffler(glasspak) wear out before it rusts out?

Thanks,

Kevin
