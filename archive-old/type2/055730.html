Can anyone tell me what the correct seat upholstery and door panels aer
supposed to look like on my 67 deluxe walkthru?  The front and rear
seats have a standard-looking black basket weave.  The front door panels
do not match the rest.  All the others have chrome trim and are all
black.  Should they be two-tone?  The seats too?  Are there any books
that would detail particular years/models interiors?  thanks.

it shoud be a two tone interior- shiny white and shiny light blue with blue
floor mats if the bus is blue and white, else a mesh platinum (like salt and
pepper but a coppery colour, with a coppery colour mesh for contrast- the
seats the mesh, the edges the coppery) with tan floor mats if it is not blue
and white (ie white/white. red/white, green/white.)   trim is between the
different colours on the panels- on the front doors, side doors, and the
pieces by the seats.    The three arm rests match the panels.  Black basket
weave is not original, but sounds like it came from a later bus or was
reupholstered.

For walk through there is a vinyl spare tire cover- light blue for blue and
white or coppery for mesh platinum.   The middle seat is usually the 2/3
length.

trim panels with matching vinyl and a shiny aluminium strip are attached under
the back seat, except spaces for the heat pipes to vent, and to the door side
of the middle seat.   Headliner covers the ceiling and the rear section of the
bus to just below the windows, including a headliner covered panel at each
rear corner.  Below that are panels in the colour scheme I mentioned before at
to match the bus.   

The deluxe also came with jailbars  for the rear windows behind the back seat,
a bar on the back of the rear seat, aluminium trim on the belt line and the
rockers, trim on front and rear bumpers, trim rings for the wheels, a clock,
chrome ashtray, and carpet behind the rear seat over the engine hump-colour
matched carpet of course.

the panels attached behind the walkthrough partition are fastened with rivets.
There is a piece of aluminium trim below the panels at each side that wraps
around into the walk through passageway.  below that is a black rubber piece
that also wraps around to the sides of the seat humps.   There is a black mat
in the walkthrough passage, held down by a metalstrip painte black in front
and behind.   Grey rubber mats are at each outer side of the front seats.

Does it look like the panels were painted over?  you may be able to clean the
paint off if so.

I sure to have forgotten some details, but I hope this gives you a better
impression.
