Subject: Re: [T2] KvS Day

Happy KVS day!

This KVS day also marks the one year anniversary of me having my bus
on the road. It's been a great year. Been daily driving my bus the
entire time except the week I had her off the road to do a head
replacement. It wouldn't have been possible without the help of Karl
and everyone else on the list. Thank you all for a great year!

peace
