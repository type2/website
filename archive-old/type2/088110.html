Subject: Re: [T2] Fw: Diesel

Turbo diesel?!?
Since when? That would take the slowness out of it!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To the list,

I know this is out of the bus venue but I was hoping that someone may have
some feed back on this one.

I'm going to look _at_ an 82 Westy that has a 1.9 turbo diesel with 50k on it.
The only thing that I know about the diesel Westy is that they do well on fuel
&amp; are as slow as the day is long.
So I need advice as if this is something worth considering of just be happy
with my 71 Westy.
