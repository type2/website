Subject: Re: [T2] Upright engine removal

Re support for the tranny when pulling the engine-
I did this plenty for a 71 camper- drive the rear wheels on a ramp that
is about 3 2x8 pieces thick nailed together.  Lower the engine WITH the
trans just short of stressing the CV's.  This allows easier access to
the upper engine nuts behind the air housing.  Then jack up the
engine/trans so it is parallel to the ground (still lowered a bit). 
Block or jackstand up the trans (I used a concrete block with 2x stock
lying on it).  The engine is easier to pull when it is parallel to the
floor as the jack rolls with the floor.  I was a poor student then, and
did this alone using 2 scissors jacks under the engine which stood on a
plyboard that had 2-3 broom handle pieces under it.  Rolled nicely  Tap
the board with a sledge hammer and you can have easy control to align
the engine for reinstall.
