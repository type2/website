Subject: Re: [T2] Bus paint jobs

Depends on what your expectations are. Bottom dollar and mediocre (quality is hit or miss with those guys) will be found with Earl Shieb and Maaco. 

Want some more fun? Call up your local community college and enrole in their autobady and paint class. They'll teach you to do it yourself, and you might be able to get in after hours or on weekends to work on your own VW - or you might be able to get your bus to be the project car for the class. 

When you are done you have the skills to do it again and again, getting better and bolder each time eventually leading to a job skill even.

Another option would be to check with the car clubs and see if any of the clubs want to help you through a paint job as a club project.
