Subject: [T2]76 alternator backing

looked in libary but didnt find what i was looking for?
   
  i am having alternator trouble and the first one i could hear the bearings going bad and changed it to another one i had laying here and it evidentually is bad cause when i turned on bus it was real sluggish and the dash lights(egr and battery)wouldnt go off.
   
  sooo a friend had one that was rebuilt i was gonna borrow till i got my rebuilt.
   
  i put it in and drove half way to work this am and the lights came on again....[[[[[egr / +]]]]]]]]
   
  i thought &amp;^%$*&amp;^%$&amp;^%*^%8&amp;)_(*&amp;_)(*(  ;)
   
  but i called him to make sure i wasnt crazy and was it possible this one was bad...
  he said yes it was possible so good enough for me and answered that right up for me.
   
  i got to take my first (repair) try of a alternator to be rebuilt in the morning. will pick it up wednesday morning.
  till then i gotta drive the bus anyways....
  i guess if i take me a spare battery and keep the one in there charged i might make it back and forth from work till then...? hopefully....
   
  my question though is this...
  the back of the alternator has two post one is a B+ and the other looks to be a shorter B+...
   
  which one does the condensor on the back hook to and which one does the 12 gauge wire hook to? or does it matter?  
   
  thanks in advance
  chai
