 Whoa momma!!! I just got back from Key West and Cozumel Mexico.  I lost
 count of the number of busses (and bugs for that matter).  I have heard
 people talk about the number of busses down there but I never imagined
there
 would be that many.  I am going to say that probably 25-40% of the vehicles
 on that island were VWs.  I took a few pictures of some nice busses that I
 will post as soon as I get them.  There was one high-top in Key West that
 looked home-made.  Very Cool.
