Subject: '77 Transporter Possibly for Sale

Hello... I'm new to this list, so please
forgive any faux pas.

I have a wonderful '77 Transporter.  For
3 years, she has sat in my driveway with
a perfect engine, but a rusted out shock
tower.  I know what's involved in changing
the beam, and I've never had the time or the
money to do it.  I've been kind of concerned
about driving her with the rusty shock tower,
so she ended up sitting there, with me thinking
I'd fix her  &quot;some day.&quot;

We're moving soon, and I just can't take her
with me.  I've tried to find someone who
can give her a good home, but have come
up short.

Here's the skinny:
VW Microbus, painted like a cow, with longhorns and a &quot;moo horn&quot;
Engine (2.0) and trans both in great shape
Moderate amount of body rust
Rusted out shock tower (pulls to right when breaking)


Please check out:

for pictures and her full story.

She's had a wonderful history with me and my friends,
and I truly love her. 

I don't know what to do with her, but I'd like
to see her go to a good home.  She's in Champaign, IL
right now, is drivable, and needs to be gone in about
a month.  Does anyone have any suggestions for me, or
would someone like to adopt her from me?

I've spent about $1200 on the engine rebuild, and I'd
like to get as much of that back out of her as I can,
but I'm more concerned that she go to someone cool who
will get her going again and love her as we have.  I've
advertised her around town for $999, and I thought that
was a pretty good deal (I'm not sure what the going rates
are for a troubled bus with a good 2.0 engine).

Does anyone have any suggestions, solutions, or interest?
This really sucks for me.

Jeff
