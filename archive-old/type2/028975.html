Joe,

I got your parts request through our feedback/ contact us page and as well
from this post. I did not know what year bus you had. I though it was a '72
from your previous ordered part. We have 211 905 887 D this is the ignition
switch housing for a '71-(early)'74 buses. You need the &quot;D&quot; portion to
assure getting the proper part. We as well have lock cylinders 211 905 855 C
and electrical portions 111 905 865 F. Also the trim piece you ordered (this
part is a little difficult to put a part # on as vw doesn't list them and
hasn't for a while). Please give a call or reply to BUStedVW_dot_com if you have
any questions. VW lists the whole set up, electrical, cylinder housing, and
trim piece as 211 905 851 AL. This does not include the lock cylinder and
key 211 905 855 C listed above.

Hello Everyone,


   I hope you all had a good 4th of July holiday. I am looking for the
following part and have been unsucsessful at finding it from my usual
channels. The part number is 211 905 887. It is the grey cylinder that the
Ignition lock cylinder and ignition switch go into on a 71 type 2
campmobile. I hope someone can help me out.

   Also I saw someon driving a bad ass bug around my area. I am hoping this
guy is on the list. If anyone is on this list from Delaware let me know. I
would like to meet up share tips etc...

Cheers,

Joe
71 Campmobile
