Subject: Re: '78 Westy Camper prices - again

Does anyone have any suggestions for publications with more realistic
prices for campers than the Gold Book? I am bringing in my 74 Camper
from Germany, but customs cannot find it in the Blue Book anymore, so I
need to supply them with a source for my vehicle's value. I will have to
pay 2.5% of the vehicle's value and would like to pay as little as
possible - transport and storage are already expensive enough ...

The car in question is a 74 Camper with the Offenbach interior (more or
less similar to the U.S. deluxe version). The bus is not a trailer queen
- plenty of rust, but reliable.
