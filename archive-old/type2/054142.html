Subject: Re: Brake servo for 71 Westy?

I've seen &quot;recycled&quot; break servos listed in &quot;Parts Place Inc. for all VW's&quot;
in Auburn Hills, MI.  I only ordered from them once. It was for a white sun
visor w/ mirror for my 78Bus. They sent a black one off of a late model
Vanagon that did not fit. It was only $5.00, so I threw it in the dumpster
and haven't ordered since.
They want $125.00 for the servo. They seem like nice people when I talked to
them on the phone.

&gt;  Anyone know where I can buy a new or remanufactured brake servo for a 71
&gt;  Westy?  Mine leaks and causes my engine to stall every time I use the
&gt;  brakes.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; California Imports  www.vwcalimports_dot_com sells remanufactured ones for
&gt; $169.95.  $75.00 core charge.  If they handle them then others must also.
&gt; Check around you will probbly get a better price.
