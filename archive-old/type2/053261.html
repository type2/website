Subject: 050 Dizzy Query

I'm in the midst of setting up my new 2L engine from AVP.  The bus is a
73, and I'll be running a Weber 32/36 DFEV on it.  I've read the library
and archives, and many folks agree that the vacuum dizzy is better than
the mechanical.

My question is for those of you who use the 050:  do you like it?  Are
there any quirks that you notice?  I'm trying to figure out if I should
use an old and worn vacuum dizzy I've got, or the new 050.

Also, if anyone has a similar set-up, any info on timing would be
helpful.

Thanks,
Jarrett
