Subject: busses in florida

Just got back from St. Petersburg/Clearwater  Florida  (Had to go down for a 
gyro...lol) and you would have thought there was a bus event going on. Think 
we counted 18 buses most bay  westys but did see a premiered split panel 
(primer) and my rice  driving(honda) companion said she saw a&quot; very nice 21 
window&quot;,(theres hope for her) all were with in a 2 mile stretch alng the main road. 
I hope when my 67 westy is cooperative I might get to see some of the same 
buses at a campout. 
Thanks Mark for letting me know I can keep the free way flyer tranny in it 
and that I need to look at other problems for the massive oil puking. 

Mario
