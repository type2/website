Subject: Re: Heater stuff

&gt;Ok, I just read your later posts and came up with a new idea.  Forget the
&gt;little electric blower.  Check out the heater tubes under the bus.  I
&gt;almost guarantee that there is something blocking the pipes.  When my '74
&gt;is running with the electric motor off, the force from the cooling fan
&gt;heats the inside up very fast.  In fact, this morning as I was driving
&gt;around I had to open the fresh air vents to cool the inside down.  And

This sounds good, but y'all are going to laugh at me.  How exactly do I
look into these pipes?  I have no jack, no garage, only the Bentley book
(which doesn't even mention heat, really) and no clue!  I am all for
replacing these pipes, but with all the other stuff under my car from the
old AC that doesn't work, and everything else (who knows?) I am afraid of
just ripping that pipe out, pulling stuffing out of it (if there's any in
it), and putting it, or some other pipe, back in!  It's hard enough just
getting under there and dodging all the crap falling into my eyes!
