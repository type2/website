Subject: NEATO BEAUTIFUL splittie spotted

 friday.. we saw a most gorgeous absolutely perfect condition splittie in
 Raleigh behind the 2nd City grill. absolutely gorgeous. blue...i was a bit
 tipsy from drowning Hurricane Fran's sorrows...so i don't remember exactly
 what kind it was. it did have a large sunroof covered by canvas. had a NEATO
 sticker on it.
 does this bus belong to anyone on the list?
