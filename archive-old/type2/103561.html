&gt;Can a carefully driven Bus negotiate such terrain, or am I foolish to

Sure!  As long as the surface is solid, the bus will do pretty well.

&gt;  Are there frame/suspension parts that, given
&gt;proper maintenance and absent rust, still can't handle a rough road?

Not really.  The suspension is pretty tough.  You just need to protect the muffler, and to some extent the sump.  Of course, your ball joints need to be in good shape also.  And be careful with approach and departure angles - the bus is bad in that respect.

&gt;How far do you have to tip a Bus before it decides to roll over?

Not as far as most vehicles I would think.  I never push my luck in that area.

&gt;  How
&gt;easy is it to get a Bus hopelessly stuck?

Very easy if the surface is slick (snow, ice, mud, wet grass) or soft (sand, mud).  Relatively high weight-to-tire ratio and lack of locking diffs (except for the Syncro) are to blame.

Here is a picture of my bus entering a sandy wash in the California desert 9 years ago:

This was about as much as I ever want to tip my bus.  We came very close to getting stuck a little farther up the road, and had to turn back.  Interestingly, out of our group of four busses, the three bays made it through that wash and the one splitty got stuck.
