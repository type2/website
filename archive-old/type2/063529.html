Juli:

In an article in the March 1989 issue of that dune buggy, show car,
and bikini magazine, there was a very informative article on
replacing the Westfalia canvas.  They mentioned using &quot;X-14,&quot;
which does contain bleach.  I've seen it in grocery stores--it's for
cleaning your bathroom.  I'd consider wearing gloves, and keeping
the stuff out of your mouth/eyes though.

In fact, I'll be using some on MY pop-top in the next couple of weeks.
