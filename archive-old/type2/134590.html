Subject: Re: [T2] Mallory

At the risk of flaring this up, what are we talking about here, dissy's or
ignition systems? I'm getting confused.
I saw this point mentioned before, if it's the dissy (or advance curve),
fiddling with the stock dissy you can get what you like if you know what your
doing, it's knowing what curve to get that's the trick.
If it's ignition system, why not get a good CDI system and be done with it?
If Jake gets a 25hp increase with the dissy, you can match that with a stock
one if you set the advance curve the same. If the increase is with a different
ignition system (that's my guess) then you need to look at more than just the
pick up in the dissy, you also need to upgrade the coil, plugs, leads etc.
Just my 2 cents worth!
