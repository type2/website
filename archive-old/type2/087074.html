&gt; Thanks to everyone who responded. Found the 4 hidden bolts and wasted the

&gt; tank required no cleaning, recoating, or replacement. 

hey, celebrate it is one part you now KNOW is not a problem.   while in
there check all the hoses.

&gt; For those thinking of pulling their tank just to check its condition, I
&gt; would suggest that they drain the tank and rent a boroscope to view its
&gt; condition through the filler neck. Unless you know that there's a problem,
&gt; it may not be worth your time to remove it.

probably a trueism...

&gt; How do I remove the panel on my 69 bus. engine is out. Engine bay insulation
&gt; is in. I have removed all the screws that I could find, but the cover
&gt; doesn't want to budge. What am I missing?
