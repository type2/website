Subject: RE: [T2] Trans-vair update (for the archives)

I've got alot more pics but these ought to give you the idea. The go cart 
and driver live up the street, the little boy is my son Zane.

I know ALOT more now than when I got started.

My kit was for a stock shift '68-'71 bus. It was NOS via another VV list 
member. I thought if I was able to find the right mounts from a '68-'71 bus 
I could bolt it right together... Not hardly! &lt;grin&gt;.

I worked alot of long days over the holidays doing alot of head scratching. 
In the end I created an adapter so the early baywindow front tranny mount 
would fit my bus and bolt to the Corvair kit tranny mount. Took alot longer 
than it should have but it works fine. I still have to take the kit tranny 
mount back off, weld up some holes and drill two new ones to mate the kit 
tranny mount to the VW tranny mount. It sits right between the two holes in 
the kit mount. No problem.

The rear crossmember was a mess. The Beetle powered bus must have the left 
side mount very close to the engine because the bar was considerably 
shorter on that side. I cut that side off and made the bar into a mirror 
image on both sides. However I then discovered that the early bay mount 
brackets that hang off of the frame of the bus were at the wrong angle so 
last night I sectioned the bar on both sides and bent the bar in the right 
direction and welded up the cuts. I have 1 weld left to do tonight.

The holiday portion of the project was long with LOTS of cleaning, lots of 
painting, lots of carb rebuilding, lots of rummaging around in my parts box 
looking for lost screws and bolts and trying to figure out what some 
obscure piece of tin was for. I ad never taken apart a complete Corvair 
engine - only my partially complete engine.

My flywheel needed bolting, the pressure plate I had was wrong, all the 
gaskets and seals required replacement. I've got the engine all together 
and ran it last weekend. No muffler but it does sound solid and it did make 
plenty of oil pressure - tops at something beyond 40 psi which according to 
the Corvair factory manual is the pressure that the relief valve opens and 
dumps excess pressure back into the sump.

So tonight is CV joint service, complete the welding on the rear 
crossmember, plan out the shifter (provided in the kit), plan out the 
exhaust, start running the wiring and fuel,  and the big job - fitting the 
surrounding tin to the engine so it seals to the body. Oh - and the heat - 
got to assemble that too.

Overall I'm excited and I really like the engine. If VW and GM had designed 
the engine together I think I would have liked it even better!

Start a new job on Monday and the wife is working 18 hour days so life is 
quite busy right now... &lt;grin&gt;



&gt;How goes the TransVair?
