&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; My neck of the woods in here in the KC area had 8&quot; of wet snow last night
&gt; and a major blackout that may not be fixed for several days.  Here at my
&gt; work, things are fine (underground utilities).

I've been without heat and lights for about 24 hrs.

&gt; Last night it was 'raining' tree limbs in from the heavy snow.  Zorm the
&gt; 58 Single Cab escaped damage as did Brownie Bus the 84 Vanagon, but a very
&gt; close call as a 4&quot; dia. limb just missed it.  Anyways, I jumped in the
&gt; Brownie Bus to get to work and low and behold, no clutch!  The slave
&gt; cylinder pooped out on me!  Sooo, Zorm to the rescue!  Started right up
&gt; and made it to work.  I did stop for gas, but their pumps were not
&gt; working, no electricity!  hmm.  This 'freak' of nature has been making
&gt; life rather strange.  8-/

Goes to show you &quot;when the going gets tough the tough drive Air Cooled
VW's&quot;.  Because it'll run, not necessarily because it'll warm you.

Electrically challenged,
