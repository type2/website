Subject: Re: [T2] Re: heater boxes

Those are bug heater boxes ya got there, Seth. The linkages *are* different;
  I believe the bus linkages come up the top and off the outside, right? Has 
anyone had any luck adapting bug heater boxes to buses? Do they work &quot;just 
fine&quot; or are they a real PITA?

Nikki
P.S. You're thinking Dansk aftermarket heater boxes.

 &gt;Secondly has anyone had any experience with the SS heater boxes either from 
the
 &gt;RMM catalog or the ones from like Denmark or one of those Scandanavian
 &gt;countries (cant remember which one)?
