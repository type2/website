Subject: [T2] Finally Got It Home!

Picked up the '77 today, had to hire a tow truck, cost a bundle, but at least 
it's home. Put some new pictures on my page &lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://hometown.aol_dot_com/fonman4277/77westy.html&quot;&gt;77Westy&lt;/A&gt; if you 
want to have a look. Yes, the girl is still there!    Jeff S.

PS-Many thanks to all those who responded to my question about towing it home 
with a tow dolly.
