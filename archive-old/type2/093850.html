Subject: bosch 009 set, black smoke

well we set our bosch distr. at about 7btdc, as far as I know this means the 
mark on the pulley when being checked with the timing light and engine 
running is about 7 degrees before the split in the case. We have been trying 
to set the carb (34pict) have been using the factory manual and even with 
setting the carb this way we still get black smoke puffing out at 
acceleration. This is on a 71 bus 1600.
