Subject: Re: Brackets

Yakima racks makes them as the foundation for their systems, they are called gutter
clamp roof system mounts.  Sometimes you want to look at the height choice if you
don't want to make your own extension piece and are trying to span the bus's arched
roofline.  For a simple setup, I used metal electric conduit pipe I had handy and
bolted straight to the mounts,  this works on my bug but I the mounts I used would
be too short to let the bar avoid the roof peak on a vw bus.   I made a couple of
separate support bars that can hold a skis or a surfboard, for example.)
Conduit is lighter and can be encircled with the foam used to insulate pipe or
nested inside an outer pvc pipe and the round shape should be better for avoiding
wind noise and drag.

 Their standard mount clamp for all their kits is pretty strong and works on fine
(mine are not in use now and are 7 yrs old).  The only thing about this is that all
the roof clamps I've seen give a slight interference when mounted outside of a door,
because the clamping part that grabs the roof rail is over 1/16&quot; thick and your
clearance of the door is about that (I did not really measure).  On the right side
(in the states) you can't avoid interference with either the front door or the
slider (not much problem with the slider, it has more sag).  If you just put new
rubber door seals on, that's what touches this clamp on the front doors as they open
and close.  AllenB_at_ingalls_dot_com wrote:

&gt; Does anyone know where I could procure brackets that grab the roof drip rail and
&gt; allow for a 2x4 cross member?  I would like to put a couple on my 71 to haul
&gt; things and can't find a pair in decent shape.
