In response to Daniel Peter Sweet, Chris Sheridan wrote:

&gt;&gt;I need to drive around for the next couple weeks and do about 700-800 miles
&gt;&gt;before I have time to drop the engine.
&gt;&gt;Is this realistic?  If I fix whatever is wrong now can I drive around on
&gt;&gt;three cylinders for two weeks?

&gt;I wouldn't recommend it. even if you've already been doing it for 3 months.
&gt;The difference now is you're aware of it. That's
&gt;why, like a greased board, the compression test never lies. good luck

Chris is absolutely correct about this, but his knowledge is based on 
experience. When our buses were new, they competed in a marketplace of 
automobiles in which they were a bit different from the average vehicle. 
Today, they are very different from the average. Most vehicles today are 
over-engineered and have redundant systems; how else could manufacturers 
offer a 100,000-mile warranty? 

In consequence, owning and operating an air-cooled VW (even one that is 
as contemporary as the '78 2.0liter, is utterly unlike owning and 
operating almost any other car or van. Some owners, like Karl van Salzen 
(see his recent post) have come to know the VW so well that they have no 
problems whatever.

But I suspect that every new owner, especially anyone who came of driving 
age after about 1980, has got to have a catastrophic failure before they 
believe what Chris and others tell them. Many of the really smart folks 
on this list have gone through the experience. Go back in the archives 
and you'll see. Today's guru was yesterday's &quot;Can I drive on two 
cylinders?&quot; poster.

So Daniel, drive the thing until it dies. Be prepared to do a complete 
rebuild. It will cost you around $1500 if you do it yourself, more if 
someone else does it. Note carefully how the bus feels when it siezes up. 
You won't do that again.

Sadder but wiser,
