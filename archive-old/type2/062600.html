What if the oil dip stick is darn hot, what cause it? Too much oil?

&gt; stick only gets slightly warm and would have to go a long way to be too hot
&gt; to hold onto.
&gt; So either the test works and I have a really cool running engine (I hope)
&gt; or the test is not real reliable with the type 4 engine.
&gt; Any other opinions out there?  I hope it works because it is real easy
