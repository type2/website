Subject: Dormobile 1600 Engine removal problem

Hi All,
I own a 1969 Dormobile, that due to financial constraints, i have been
unable to restore for the last 4 years (hence he lives down the side of
my house).It has flat and ruined tyres, is completely rotten underneath
and is stuck in gear, BUT I paid for the engine to be rebuilt before it
was immobilised (it has not been fully run in) and would like to remove
it before my van is disposed of (anyone in the Midlands area (UK) is
free to make enquiries if they wish to have the Van as project). I know
this sounds ruthless, but I am having another Dormobile restored for me
which will be ready by August.
So to the question, how can I get the engine out most cost effectively
and safely (short of towing it to a garage for removal)?  
Yours hopefully
Mark Woodward
