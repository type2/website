been using the [aftermarket] Dansk heat exchangers on the bus upright [type
1] engines and haven't had any problem with them, yet.......

aftermarket parts we have had problems with are: 1. generator/alternator
pulleys[hecho in Mexico] they discentigrate.  2.  Steering boxes [hecho in
Mexico] they shot peen the shafts. 3.  cv boots [made in Germany] dunno,
what causes these things to go after just a few hundred miles  4. rear brake
drums [hecho in Mexico] machined incorrectly, using metal that's too soft.
5. rear hanger,* rubber, motor mounts* [made in India]  they pull apart,
soft like Jell-O.

are their any others?

&gt; &lt;&lt; For more than 4 years, I have been trying to elicit information from
other
&gt; VW Type 2 owners, about the nature and extent of problems with exhaust
heat
&gt; exchangers, from Dansk Autopart and other manufactures. It is my
intention,
&gt; to present this damning evidence to them, in order to try to pursuade
them,
&gt; to do something about these faults, so please send me as much information
as
&gt; possible. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; My experience is that you need to replace both exchangers at the same
time.
&gt; The new exchangers are different than the old ones.  The exhaust ports are
&gt; about 1/2&quot; higher, and if you only replace one side, your muffler won't
match
&gt; up.  Other than the exhaust ports, I have no other problems with the
&gt; exchangers.  Of course, I may have a set from a different batch.
