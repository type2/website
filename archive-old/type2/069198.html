Subject: re: Place for out-of-print owners manuals

&gt;I just ordered a NOS Owners Manual for my '64 Standard/Microbus from Sun
&gt;Bugs, don't have the address/phone number here, but it is someplace in
&gt;deepest California, they had a flyer in a recent NEATO newsletter.
&gt;$38, included shipping.

I actually meant reply to this a little earlier but work, work, work...

Anyway, Sun Bugs is run by a guy called Rex Eastmann who I've had a little
to do with for various reasons (more news soon...stay tuned) and he has
O.E.M. Owner's Manuals from 1960-1979 in stock with prices ranging from
$20-$50.

The other things he has that I thought were sorta cool were some pewter 23
window and crew cabs and (believe or not) original style coveralls and
workshirts (I want some coveralls for Christmas - am I getting somewhat
obsessed?). He also flogs t-shirts and trinkets and 'the usual' stuff.

He normally sells wholesale but says he wouldn't mind handling direct mail
orders for manuals or other......the no. for Sun Bugs is (209) 742-6789.

I hope this doesn't read like a blatant plug but he is a nice 'straight up'
guy and the one of the few I've met in the VW 'business' who doesn't seem
to have a fin and look like a great white!
