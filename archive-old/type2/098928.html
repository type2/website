Subject: Vanagon seats in a '74

I was driving down the road the other day and found a Vanagon captain's chair
(maybe a rear-facing chair) on the side of the road. It's in great shape and
the beige cloth matches the carpet in my '74 (that I put in) perfectly. It's
not a front seat because it doesn't have a head rest and it's on a pedastel
with a swivel. I took the seat off the swivel to see if it would fit in the
driver's side front. It almost fits and would work with a little modification.
The ride height is a little higher than my late-bay seat I was using. And it's
MUCH more comfy, provides alot more support and has nice arm rests.

My question is: I want mathing seats in the front. If I modify to put this
seat in, how hard will it be to find a match for the other side? If I look for
Vanagon front seats, will the driver's side fit unmodified? The passenger side
on the '74 is very different (seat is sort of 'hinged' on hooks on the
platform) and will require modification no matter what I do.

Oh yeah, the seat also had a nice retractable lap belt. What a score! I'm sure
I'll end up paying an arm and a leg to find a match though.

-Eric
