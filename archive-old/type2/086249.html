Since there are no gauges (tachometer or temp) in my bus that help me
determine how hard my engine is working, I was wondering if you guys have
any suggestions on roughly how hard is too hard to push my bus.  I'm driving
a 71 Westy that supposedly has a recently rebuilt 1600cc engine in it
(although I wonder about the craftsmanship involved considering my engine
just fell out due to a previously cracked engine mount that finally just
sheared off completely).  Any rough ideas would help, like for instance &quot;on
a straight away, 70 mph is probably an upper bound&quot;, or &quot;when climbing a
hill in 2nd gear, I don't usually push it above 25 mph&quot;, etc.

I'm probably going to try and install some aftermarket gauges, especially an
oil temperature gauge, but for the time being, I'd like to be able to feel a
little bit more confident that I'm not unknowingly abusing my engine.
