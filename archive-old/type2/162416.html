&gt; There are two ways to fix the filler neck, none really easy or nice:

&gt; 1) Pull out aircleaner/AFM assembly. Remove ECU. Remove round block-off
&gt; plate. Hope the hose clamps are oriented so you can get them off. Find
&gt; someone with monkey-arms to get in there to pull off filler. Have same
&gt; person put new one back in.

I did #1 and did it while my engine was already out for another reason.
used &quot;stubby&quot; screwdrivers and I still have to say it rates in the top 3
as the biggest PITA jobs I have ever done on a bus.....
