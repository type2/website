Subject: [T2] Cylinder head temp?

Cylinder head temp gauges can be elusive if they are defective.
In the event that your gauge is not defective there are several things that
will give you high operating temperatures.
#1) Foremost high temp reading will come from wrong timing set.
#2) Secondary to inspect is the fuel delivery and lean burn from FI
problems.
Your spark plugs should be the color of coffee with cream.
#3) Inspect for vacuum leaks that can cause lean burn.
Short periods of a 500+ degree reading can be expected as normal if your
pushing up hill or against a headwind.
Just back off and don't work the engine that hard.
In several years of operating a 83 Air Cooled Westy I found that 350-450
were normal operating ranges even with outside temps as high as 110 degrees.
If you added wire to lengthen the VDO kit wires you should solder the
connection (use the minimum amount of solder required) and be sure you
haven't wrapped it around the under van wire loom.
The wire used to lengthen the VDO install kit wires should be multi stranded
like the kit wires and be the same gauge. If you wrap the sender wire around
the VW wire loom it becomes charged by the current passing through your
system.
My problem with VDO gauges was that the faces fell off when they metal rim
broke away from the plastic. Another repair job for J-B Weld.
