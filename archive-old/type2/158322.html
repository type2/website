&gt; If you haven't done this simple SIMPLE upgrade yet,
&gt; DO IT NOW.

Before you order, check this (http://www.danielsternlighting_dot_com/)
website and learn about what you're thinking of upgrading.  Test the
voltage at your headlamp socket.  If you don't have full voltage, new
bulbs aren't going to do as much as you'd like - you need a relay. 
That said, there are lots of different reflectors and bulbs out there,
so do some research first.
