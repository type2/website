Dear type2 brothers and sisters,

I am shocked, shocked, at the paucity of collective list certainty 
concerning the make-up of the EGR filter. Is it filled with charcoal? 
Steel wool? Beasties? Can we make our own and get it by the smog meanies, 
or is this the ultimate consumer product with a planned obsolescence? 
Maybe some filters are charcoal and some are steel wool, depending upon 
what was in stock at the manufacturer?

Me thinks we need to get our act together!
