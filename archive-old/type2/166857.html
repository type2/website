Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon Alloys on a Bay

Well, you guys never cease to surprise me.  I saw a post of Karl's about torquing lug nuts.  At the time I just chuckled knowing that Karl is somewhat of a perfectionist.  I've never in my life heard of anybody torquing lug nuts.  I always just got them tight with a lug wrench and didn't worry about it.  Is this something VW specific or have I been risking mine and somebody else's lives all these years in the many vehicles I've owned having lost only one lug nut that I can remember?   Learn something new here every day.  Thanks....KR

&gt;The lug nuts for the steel wheels get 123 ft.lbs. in the rear. It seem like a lot but that's what Bentley says.

I got mixed up between Vanagon and Bay thinking about those wheels. The Baywindow lug nuts get 94 ft.lbs.
