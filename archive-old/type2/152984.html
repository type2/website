Subject: Buses by the Beach Fall Camp Sept 16-18

Hey, Volks:

It's almost time for everyone to be together again at &quot;BUS BOO!&quot; Buses
By the Beach annual fall campout an Halloween before Halloween party
in Grand Rapids, MI Sept. 16th, 17th &amp; 18th. It looks like we are in
for another great turn out of Bus Pilots and VW lovers from all over
the country. So bring your musical instruments for some campfire
jamin'. Remember, it's not about sounding good, just feeling good!

 

If you have not made reservations please call the campground so we can
plan for camping space. Call Grand Rogue at 1-616-361-1053 located at
6400 West River Drive, Belmont, MI 49306. Make sure you tell them that
you are with Buses By the Beach group so they can group us all
together. http://www.grandrogue_dot_com/

 

Back by popular demand, we are camping during the West Michigan Living
History and Educational Association presentation of Early America
Encampment at Grand Rogue Campground. Visitors can view first hand
what life in early America was like. There will be period craftsmen
demonstrating their skills, including a blacksmith and a woodworker.
Working with hand tools, they show how everyday implements were made
in early America. At the Encampment, history buffs wearing authentic
period clothing and living in period shelters, present programs
throughout the weekend. Activities will include musket and cannon
firing, men's and women's period fashion shows and tactical
demonstrations. For more information go to:
