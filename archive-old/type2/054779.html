Subject: End of the Road

 &gt; Well, it would seem I've hit the end of the road with Kevin... The Devcon
 &gt; didn't work (tried to seal a crack in the block), and the engine is now
 &gt; kaput.. (technically speaking)

The engine is the most replaceable part of the bus. It's designed so that YOU 
can replace it. Pull the bus off the road, behind the garage. Buy a copy of 
How
To Keep Your VW Alive, by Muir, dig up all the tools you can find or borrow, 
and 
take the engine out yourself. 

Remove the main seal and clutch first thing, and while you're at it take all 
the good
working stuff off the engine, such as distributor, carb &amp; Intake, fan and 
generator, fuel pump and shroud. You get the idea, you know all that still 
functions. It's the block you need to change. So strip it down to a 
shortblock, then you just have to replace the shortblock. You can buy one of 
those from Mofoco or some such place for a few hundred, then you've got the 
shipping. Have them throw in an exhaust and gasket 
kit &amp; rings for a few hundred more, and you've got a workable model for being 
back 
on the road in a few weeks.
