Subject: vacum advance-bye bye 009

Well I finally gave in and tossed out my 009 dizzy now that I am going to
use my big dual Weber 40 IDF carbs.

We totally revamped a vacum dizzy from a 73 last night and it looks and
moves great!

Anyway I am not sure how to hook the new braided vacum hoses up. I copied
David Schrawze's notes from the other month:

&quot;The port at the base of the left carb should go to the
lower (inner) inlet on the distributor.  The port on the body of the left or
right carb should go to the upper (outer) inlet on the distributor&quot;.  There,
that's one more gallon.  :-)     -David

However all I have is one outlet on the base of each carb. Should I run a
tee from both carbs to ? And what about the other nipple on the dizzy? I
have the stuff to drill and tap an outlet on the intakes if need be. I would
be scared to do that to the carb body though!

Can somebody offer some advice on this?


On a side note anyone who was following my clutch problems..I have the new
210 flywheel and clutch and have set my end play. Waiting on one spacer for
my cooling fan and I should be done. Here are some pics:
