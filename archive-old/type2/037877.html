Subject: Re: will additives do any harm......

Re additives (engine and tranny)-as queried by Scott Solomon.....I don't
think these will do any harm (some say only to your wallet :-)
   I got my 78 Westy from a lady in 1985, had 60K on it then..._dot_used
TUFOIL ever since with oil changes.  Does it work?  I'm the only one I
know who has gone 214,500 miles on his all original engine still pushing
135psi -Just got back from a 600 mi trip to NY, Conn, Mass.  I pulled it
ONCE in its life to check the clutch disk before our 10,000 mi trip into
the mountains- looked good but had a broken spring and I replaced it! 
Only other moving part replaced were the hydraulic lifters -around
80-100K by an overzealous mechanic who claimed it was needed after
&quot;clattering&quot;.  Now I know better, do all my own work, and just wait for
the lifters to pump up!
   I read somewhere that TUFOIL has data that showed a doubling of the
life of forklift engines, a more &quot;controlled&quot; engine application.  It
contains molybdenum as well as PTFE- holds the Guinness book record for
&quot;slipperest stuff on earth&quot;.  I don't know if they have it for trannies,
but believe they are on the web under TUFOIL_dot_com.
