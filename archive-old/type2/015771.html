&gt; First, the manual says &quot;make sure the forge mark of the rod faces up
&gt; as shown in FIGURE 96.&quot;  FIGURE 96 is a small photo of a crank with
&gt; the 4 rods attached, and there's an arrow to a small white mark on
&gt; the center of each rod.  This seems to be refering to some marking I
&gt; should be able to distinguish on the rods but, frankly, both sides of
&gt; all the rods look more or less the same.  That is, there's (I guess)
&gt; a forge mark about 1/4&quot; wide down the center of both sides of the
&gt; rod.

I don't remember a forge mark on my rods.

&gt; Secondly, the manual says &quot;peen each rod nut into the slot on the rod
&gt; to lock it in place (FIGURE 97).&quot;  Figure 97 is a line drawing
&gt; showing a close up of an assembled rod; it looks like each rod is
&gt; supposed to have a small &quot;slot&quot; right where it interfaces with the
&gt; nut, and this slot receives the peened material from the nut.  But,
&gt; I'm sure not seeing any &quot;slot&quot; on any of the rods I'm holding in my
&gt; hand.  Can anybody help out with this?

I didn't peen mine and 54000 miles later I've had no problems.  I just
torqued them down and used loctite.
