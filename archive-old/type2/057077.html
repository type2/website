Hi

I just redid one of my CV boots and theres a fair bit of side to side play
on mine on both sides. I think its probably essential to allow for the
flexing of the trans with the suspension. 

When I took the CV off there was a cupped washer in the boot kit which was
to fit between the end of the drive shaft and the joint and the kit said to
replace this on CV's where it was required. I tried it and this took all the
play out, but decided that since there hadn't been one previously fitted and
the joint hasn't given any trouble, only the rubber boot had split, to leave
it off.

Anybody else want to comment on this?
