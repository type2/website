Subject: What speed can you climb hills at?

Ok, so I'm a relative newbie to buses.  I've had my '76 Westy for a year now
and put about 12,000 miles on it (10,000 on a fresh AVP engine).  With wife
&amp; child &amp; small amount of supplies, I can cruise at 70-75 on the flats.  As
soon as I hit any hills, I'm struggling to stay at 50, and when it's hot
outside (80F+), I can't get much over 40 without seeing oil temps climb over
235.  My question is this:  with a good 2L FI engine, what kind of speeds
should I expect to be able to do up the hills?  Having no experience with
these beasts, I don't know if mine is performing poorly and needs to be
fixed, or this is what I should be expecting.  Please, oh mighty list, tell
me - do I need a bigger engine to satisfy the hill gods or is there
something wrong with the one I have?
