Subject: Re: Heat for da bus

&gt;I've been contemplating on what kind of heat to use in my little storage
&gt;shed I built, and in my search for a good heater, it seems to me that a
&gt;double-eye propane heater will work well.  I know the kerosene heaters
&gt;work great but they are expensive.  So this got me to wondering, if one
&gt;had a way to anchor down the propane bottle, could you use a propane
&gt;heater with the infra-red elements?  Granted, it is sort of an &quot;open&quot;
&gt;flame but I would think if a person anchored it real well, that it would
&gt;be an excellent source of heat.  And all you'd have to do is make sure
&gt;you had enough rust holes for fresh air. :-)
&gt;
&gt;What do y'all think?

I used a small propane tent heater bungied to the floor between the front seats
for two winters. It used disposable canisters (Coleman) and made 3000 BTU.
Which is enough if you have a cockpit partition and a warm coat.  We had to
be careful with coats and sleeves and stuff, not to burn anything.  We got
the Gas heater working late last year and it is much more powerful, so we
don't need the propane this year, but it got us through some cold drives.

Just be REALLY careful. :-)
