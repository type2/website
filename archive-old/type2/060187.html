Subject: insurmountable VW frustration

I'm also sending this to my awesome mobile mechanic. Christopher, there
are some things in here that I may not have mentioned. Whew, this has
gotten really long, but I'm at my wits' end, that not being very far to
begin with... &lt;shrug&gt; Hope it's at least a good read!

Sounds positively dreamy.

Says a graveyard worker who spent the day while she should have been
sleeping, working on her bus. Finally paid someone else to look at it, and
he couldn't figure out what's wrong, either. Now I get to spend 10 hours
at work, and then ride the city bus home, an hour and a half commute each
way, instead of the 20 minutes it would take if I could drive.&lt;/vent&gt;

So, here's the deal. 71 bus, 1600dp engine, one Solex 34pict3 carb, 009
dizzy. Ever since I bought the bus, about 1500 miles ago, I couldn't let
my foot off the gas until it was thoroughly warmed up, at least five
minutes. The PO says it was that way the whole time he had it, as well. It
would start easily, and keep running as long as it had extra gas. I've
tuned it up to the best of my ability, adjusted the timing and the
mixture/idle speed, but nothing seemed to help. It ran OK once it was
warmed up. Not really well, it would miss occasionally, but it ran.

When I bought the bus and brought it home from Olympia, it seemed to have
pretty good power, I could go up hills at 60-65 (freeway speed limit
around there is 70, I didn't push it that far). I didn't examine it very
carefully before I bought it, I didn't know much about VWs, and I trusted
the friend I bought it from. After I got it home, I set about tuning it
up, because I know that mainenance is really important. The first thing I
did was pull a spark plug wire off, to take a look at the spark plug. The
rubber boot disintegrated in my hands... So begins the nightmare.

So, lucky me, I have an auto parts store around the corner from my house.
I went and bought new plugs and wires. 

Now, the first thing I noticed, is that the plug wires that were on there,
were not anything like the ones that I've bought since then. (I've bought
3 sets of new plug wires) They had rubber boots, not ceramic, and they
didn't have that little rubber sealing bit on the boot. I wish, now, that
I'd saved the remains of the wires, but all four of the boots tore when
they came off, and I didn't have any reason to think that I was going to
need them for anything. So, I can't really say what sort of wires they
were or what might have been different about them, other than the kind of
boots they had. And they were orange. The plugs didn't look too bad, they
had the usual sort of tan buildup that you would expect from plugs that
had been in for a while.

The bus has never run as well as it did _before_ I replaced the plugs and
wires. After I replaced the plugs and wires, it didn't have as much power,
would lose speed badly on hills.

The adventure with the plugs and wires took longer than I expected, so I
decided to put off the rest of my tune-up. A few days later, I went ahead
and replaced the points, condensor, cap and rotor. Adjusted the valves. I
don't know when it had last been done, but the valve covers looked fairly
pristine, there were no dents like anyone had ever tried to pull the bails
off. There were no leaks, but the gaskets were dead. The valves were
totally tight.  Couldn't get my smallest feeler guage in. Yikes! So I
adjusted all the valves, and changed the oil.

Went to visit my friend, who lives over the West Hills (you know, the ones
in the Everclear song &lt;g&gt;). The gen light came on, and I didn't know
enough to stop, it wasn't that far and I didn't want to be stuck on the 
side of the road with my 7 year old... &lt;sigh&gt; It was dark, and I didn't
realize how hot it had gotten until I got there and saw the smoke coming
out of the back end...

The next morning we took my daughter to school in my friend's shiny red
truck, which he never has to work on... &lt;sigh&gt; and then went and got a
new fan belt, plugs, and another set of wires (the rubber seals were
melted...) No, I can't tell you why I hadn't replaced the fan belt before,
I can't for the life of me imagine what I was thinking. The oil still
looked good, but I changed it again anyway, figuring it had gotten hot
enough to break down somewhat. (Pennzoil 20/50, it being June) The plugs
were blackened a little.

I checked the valves, there was a sort of burnt smell when I pulled off
the covers, I decided to believe maybe it was because the cork gaskets had
gotten so hot, so I replaced them. Well, the bus ran again &lt;wheww&gt; no
worse than it had before I overheated it, but still not as well as it did
before I replaced the spark plug wires the first time.

It seemed to me that the bus was running pretty hot. I noticed that when I
got out after driving home on the freeway, it smelled hot-ish. So, I
actually paid someone to check my work in tuning it up, and to install an
oil temp gauge. &lt;growl&gt; I am REALLY mad at this guy, I paid him quite a
bit, and he didn't hook up the stuff back up in the dash right, he broke
the ends off the controls for my heater, and when he eventually installed
a new engine seal, he apparently didn't do it right, according to my new
mechanic, who I'm more inclined to trust. (Hi Christopher!) He had me
timing at 10BTDC. Christopher says he times his with a similar setup at
0,TDC.

Anyway. After I paid him all the money to install it, he told me he had no
idea what the proper temperature was. &lt;sigh&gt; In frustration, I let it get
up to 275 one time before I pulled over. Later I found out that the proper
operating temperature is 125-158...

I'd noticed that there seemed to be a vacuum leak, it would do that
'revving up, revving down' sort of thing. I noticed that the sleeves that
seal the intake manifold to the intake pipes looked a little worn and
crackly. Yuck. I put it off for a while, not yet feeling adventurous
enough to take it all apart. Eventually, I noticed that the symptom went
away... Weird.

About a month ago, I started having trouble starting it. I had to really
pump the gas, and after it cranked for a while, it would start trying to
catch. Eventually it would start up, and as long as I kept pumping the
gas, it would run, with some backfiring, until it warmed up, at which
point it would run and drive, although it seemed to run a little rougher
than before. I tried adjusting the carb, but nothing i did seemed to make
any difference. At this point, I decided to go ahead and replace the
intake manifold sleeves. Whoa! There was a full-on _hole_, a big old tear
in one of them... Put it all back together, didn't seem to be any change.
Over the course of the week, it got worse and worse, until it wouldn't
start at all. It would crank, but not fire.

I don't know why I decided that it was a fuel problem. Probably because I
had replaced most of the electrical bits, and because I didn't have anyone
to turn the motor over so I could check if there was spark. And because
adjusting the carb didn't seem to do much.

So, the first thing I replaced, since it was cheap and I couldn't see any
gas going into the carb, was the fuel pump. The fuel pump that was on
there was one of the older ones with all the little screws on the top. The
parts guys gave me a newer one, the'right' one for a 71. It didn't work at
all. Didn't pump any fuel. So I put the old one back on, and could see
fuel getting to the filter again. But it still wouldn't start.

OK, well, I decided that since I knew there was rust in the gas tank, due
to the fuel filters getting nasty so fast, that maybe the carb was fouled.
I pulled it out to rebuild it. Trying to pull the top off the float bowl,
I pulled too hard, the 'lid' stayed in my hand, and the carb itself
bounced off the edge of the curb, and rolled across the grass. &lt;sigh&gt; The
float was still in the bowl, but the pin was missing. Never did find it.
Found something about the right size and substituted it, finished the
rebuild, even though I figured that I was gonna have to replace the carb
at this point. Unsurprisingly, it still wouldn't start. So, I got a new
carb. Still wouldn't start.

I started checking electrical stuff, and found that the points had somehow
moved, and were closed all the way. So, I re gapped them. Still didn't
start.

I got somebody to help, finally, he turned the key for me, and I saw that
there didn't seem to be any spark from the coil. Ugh. So, I'd wasted three
weeks, and probably wrecked my old carb, very possibly for no reason. We
replaced the coil, and it still wouldn't start, although now I was getting
good spark from the coil. 

As we were driving away in his truck to go get the coil, I noticed a note
on my windshield, but hadn't stopped to pull it off. When we got back from
the parts store, I took a look at it, it was a flyer for a mobile VW
mechanic! Gave him a call, left my friend's cell phone number, since we
were outside. Installed the new coil, hooked it up. No joy.

Went back and got spark plug wires, since the ones I had on there were the
ones my friend insisted I buy during the fan belt incident, the Autolite
kind that you put together yourself, and I wasn't convinced we'd put them
together well. I went to my VW parts guys, I figured they'd have wires
that were more likely to work well for my bus.

As we were pulling up to the parts store, we got a call from Christopher,
the mobile mechanic. I'd spent so long trying unsuccessfully to start it,
Christopher thought the plugs might be fouled, and since I was putting on
new wires, I got new plugs too.

Hallelujah! IT STARTED! I screamed and jumped out and hugged my friend,
and jumped up and down and danced around for a while and ran in the house
to call Christopher and ask him to listen to it over the phone and tell me
if he thought it sounded like it was running kinda fast, and just as I
picked up the phone, the bus died....

It hasn't started again since then. Christopher came over and we spent two
hours going over everything. He replaced the points. There's spark all the
way, from the coil, across the points... Um... I'm pretty sure he checked
the spark from the wires to the plugs, although he'll have to verify that.
There's gas getting to the cylinders, after we'd tried to start it, he
pulled one and it smelled like gas.

It's got gas and spark, it should run, right? We both figure that it's
something painfully obvious that we're missing. We've gone through every
troubleshooting step either of us can think of, and it JUST WON'T GO!

Any ideas? I'm tired of begging my friends for rides to the store!
