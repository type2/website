&gt; the little rectangular shaped side markers are held onto the body
&gt; of my bus with little small plastic clips.  recently, one of the clips
&gt; broke.  had anyone found a way to replace those clips?
&gt;
&gt; i'd like to find a way to fix this, instead of ordering a
&gt; new housing. kinda pricey.

I used something called a Well-nut - basically a brass nut embedded in a
flanged rubber bushing.  Drill out the side marker mounting holes to accept
the rubber bushing, push the well-nut in and use new stainless screws (I
only found the well-nuts in non-metric) to attach the side marker.  The
friction of the rubber in the hole keeps the nut/bushing from turning until
the rubber bushing starts to compress and grab the metal.  I don't know
where to get these things, I just had them in my stash.  Hope this makes
sense.
