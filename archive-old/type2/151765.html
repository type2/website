Subject: Re: [T2] Bearing expert

Richard,

Went thru this with one fo the ME's and a machinist at work several weeks 
ago.

Let me see if I can get it right....

Open is for folks who provide their own &quot;covers&quot; for the bearings...as in 
the rear bearings in a swing axle bug where you *want* to let the oil flow 
thru and around the bearings.

Rubber V.S. metal is more perplexing....rubber is for washdown situations 
where you don't want fluid inside, although the ones I have seen were not 
impressive in that respect.  

Metal for just keeping the big stuff out of the bearings....although some 
metal ones do have rubber lips on them if I remember correctly.

www.mcmaster_dot_com is your friend.

Bearings seem to be one of those things that cost  a *lot*.

Hope that helped...

Cheers, dave

&gt; I'm looking for some replacement bearings and 
need to know what's suitable and what's not when substituting.
