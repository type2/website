Subject: Re: [T2] pic of seatbelt L-bracket?

Roger,

I did this retrofit this summer.  I just took one of the retractors to my 
local hardware store and wandered around til I found something that was the 
right size and thickness.  I found a piece of garage door hardware, a 
mounting bracket, that worked great.  It was about 5/16&quot; thick.  I had to 
cut part of it off since it was too long.  Also had to drill holes to fit 
the retractor.
