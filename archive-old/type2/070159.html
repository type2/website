i put a couple of spare quarts of oil in the other battery tray, along 
with a rag.  it gets hot there, and without a box or something, i would 
not put much else there.

i manage to stuff most of my spares in the rear cabinet behind the back 
seat.  this door is tough to reach when inside the van anyway, and so my 
other gear gets the more priveliged positions up front.

you really dont need to carry a mountain of spares, though.  just a 
large hill of them.  ;)
