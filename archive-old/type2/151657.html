Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel oil

Mike,


Ummmm....don't look now, but....

TSB 01-4-7 pertains to the recommended Engine oil in many new Ford and 
Lincoln/Mercury vehicles.  Specifically, it addresses the use of the new 
5W-20 engine oil formulation.

5W-20!!!!????


Oh, and you were saying....&lt;grin&gt;
