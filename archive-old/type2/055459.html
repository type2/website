&gt; &gt; All else aside, if you fill in the engine cooling vents, you will
&gt; have a lot of
&gt; &gt; fun rebuilding your engine every few months when it overheats from
&gt; lack of
&gt; &gt; fresh cooling air...
&gt; 
&gt; The folks who close off the vents add ducting to draw air from under
&gt; the vehicle to cool the engine.
&gt; 
&gt; This air, of course, is dirty.  This doesn't really matter, since
&gt; these are show cars that never actually get driven except from the
&gt; trailer to the display area (if that!)  A very silly use for a VW, IMHO.

	Thanks to William Abbott for lots of good suggestions! The &quot;lead
sled&quot; look is what I'm trying to achieve, although I do catch grief from
some rockabilly types for using a VW rather than Amer-i-can iron. I want
something a little different though, and I love my bus to death. I guess I
would say I'm going for a mix of early style ('32, '34 ford) vintage 
hotrod and the later (40's merc, buick, chevy, etc.) &quot;lead sled&quot; look.
	Since I won't have the cash for the paint for a while I've thought
about going satin...all flat black primer with some nice yellow,orange
flames on the front. I will probably not go this route, even though I
think that would look REALLY cool (and get lots of double takes from the
VW people and the Hot Rodders) due to our HOT summers and lack of AC
(other than 8-60 ;)
	 I may still go with some subtle intricate pinstriping and
flying eyeball a la Von Dutch. I would stop short of the pinstriped lady
manequin laying on a bed of long, pink, fake fur in the back window!

Uh sorry for rambling, I just find that whole subculture facinating! 

	Anyway, I had already decided to go with drawing air from under
the bus. I have measured the area of the louvers to get an idea of how
large to make the duct I'm fabricating from sheetmetal. The duct will face
front and therefore should scoop more air than the louvers. However, I
have thought about putting in an electric fan (OOPS! don't mean to start
the &quot;electric fan for cooling&quot; thread again!). I may just put in the duct
and take a test run, watching guages to see if the fan is necessary.
Would a screen be enough to keep the debris out? or do I need to go with
something a little more filter like? I would like to hear opinons on fans,
ducts, and filter vs. screens.
	This isn't my daily driver (I usually ride my wife Ninja ;) though
it will still get frequent use.
