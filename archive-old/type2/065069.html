My dad was stationed in Germany ending in 1955.  He brought back with 
him (start crying) a '52 Bug with '49 running gear.  It was shipped 
into San Francisco.  It had been coated with waxy goo to prevent salt 
water damage, had been knocked around a little in transit.  The 
muffler had been crunched, a bumper had been twisted and ended up 
pointing up, and had other various other mechanical ailments.  He 
drove it to the SF VW dealer's front, belching and smoking, coughing 
and generally looking REALLY bad (the bug, not dad).  They PROMPLTY 
asked him to go around and park it in the back to keep the showroom 
customers from seeing it.  It looked a mess.  Unfortunately they sold it 
before I knew what cars were (a babe in arms at the time).  They had
great chuckles getting people to believe that the starter was above the 
rear wheel.
