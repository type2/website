Hi Volks!

&gt; i'm pretty familiar with the volkswagen part numbering scheme of

&gt; methodology to this part numbering system like the other?  

If I may guess rather blindly, I'll say it's generic stuff:
parts that are not particular to Volkswagens, but still need
some part number so that they can be ordered and handled by
Volkswagen dealers.  At least, I've only ever seen N numbers
on stuff like bolts, hoses, grommets and such.

Airhowlingly yours,
