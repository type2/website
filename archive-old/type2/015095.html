Subject: Trim Clips
Mime-Version: 1.0

	Anyone know of a source for the trim clips that hold the molding trim on
the body just below the windows of my '71 bus.  Just finished painting it
today ( a rare 70 degree New Hampshire day in Oct.)  Have about one-half of
them the others broke as I was removing the screws.  RMMW sells something
that look like them but for Ghia dash molding.

Thanks
