I thought that my mention of &quot;even when I take it out of gear&quot; would
eliminate CV's?  Is that an incorrect assumption?

Not sure, that's why I'm asking for help.

Yesterday I finally reached Bus Depot and ordered everything to do a wheel
bearing.  If I get my new '65 CrewCab up and running (so I have something to
drive), I may try the bearing myself.

Could also be the gear reduction boxes?  Or perhaps the CV's?  Just
brainstorming here...  

Can anyone rule out these other possibilities?
