&lt;&lt; I just got emailed an &quot;ok&quot; from the author (Ron Maxon) of the article
on &quot;Jalousies in a Vanagon&quot; so anyone wanting to take look at the
article should go here:

http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/vgon_jalousie/

Mr. Maxon also said in the email &quot;Glad to see people interested in
the window conversion, hopefully next time we buy a vanagon they will
already be installed&quot; &gt;&gt;

I've got a pair sitting around for anyone willing to front the freight
and an interesting trade...Quite heavy, tho'. Anyone in northern NJ
interested in a trade for something I can use on my '79 ?-)
