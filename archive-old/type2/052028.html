Gentlepersons-
                       My point was, that any (save one current manufacturer, 
that I know
of), large automaker doesn't really want to prolong the &quot;product's&quot; life too 
long. About
VW dealerships: One near me left me standing there while they &quot;looked up&quot; 
some parts
to the point that I got quite frustrated and left - Perhaps the intention of 
the parts
people? What galls me, however, is the perfectly restored convertible Beetle 
on the
show room floor, set off by stanchions, surrounded by the current fleet.
