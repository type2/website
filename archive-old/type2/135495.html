Subject: Re: [T2] from 1.8 to 2 w/ hydr. lifters

Hi Sami,

I've been running with 1.8L L-Jet FI in the westfakia for about 6000 
miles.

The 1.8L FI is definitely &quot;close enough&quot;. The computer is designed to 
produce mixture based on airflow, and if the airflow is 10% higher, the 
ECU will provide more fuel to compensate. There is some risk that you 
could wind up in a lean condition when running at WOT, but since that 
is well beyond the useful operating range of a 1.8L installed in a bus 
I don't think it's a problem. YMMV.

Interestingly, the 2L engined buses got an increase in top-speed gear 
ratio that halved the difference in airflow between the 1.8 and 2L 
displacement at a given highway speed. So the difference in fuel 
metering is *probably* even less than the 10% difference in 
displacement would indicate. Only the VW engineers know for certain, 
but the empirical evidence shows that the setup is close enough for my 
needs.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts

&gt; Question: the busdepot suggests the 2 liter engine as an upgrade to 
&gt; the 1.8. In my opinion, the FI is probably not optimized for the extra 
&gt; displacement, but is it close enough?
&gt;
&gt; I'm also considering a move to hydraulic lifters. I cannot think of 
&gt; any reason why this would be a problem, but if anyone does, please do 
&gt; let me know.
