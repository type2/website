Subject: Accelerator Cable Broken!

hey hey guys/gals...
my accelerator cable on Stella decided to snap last night in the frigid
temperatures as i was setting the choke...
it busted up front just back from the pedal pan...  it was about
midnight then and I was going to drive it back home (30+miles of
highway..but about 10 of city) using a steady rpm...but I didn't...  I
just left her in the other town :( feeling neglected.  One of my friends
was nice enough to  give me a lift home...
anyways...whats the easiest way to do an accelerator cable with basic
tools (in my bus :) and in the freezing cold.

My books are at the shop somewhere so...
someone please reply ASAP as I NEED to get over there and do it today
once I dig up  a cable....
later
