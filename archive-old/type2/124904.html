Subject: Re: [T2] continental vanco 8 personal experiences

Jon,

These tires are a fairly new product, I believe. John Baird has had them for
a couple of months and is tickled with them. When I saw them on his bus last
month I asked him how he liked them and his response (and the price) was
plenty enough to sway me towards them instead of the Bridgestone Desert
Duelers I have used in the past. Plus the product info about these tires on
Continental's website even says &quot;for the Volkswagen vans&quot;.

If you hear any more info about these tires pass it on, as I hope to replace
the dinky car tires the po put on my bus soon.
