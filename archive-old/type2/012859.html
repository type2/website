Subject: too much oil??? How do I check (need advice)

I have a major leak of oil on the driver's side I need to investigate.

The dipstick has consistently read high, by 1/4 to 1/2 of the overall 
range width.

I also think the back of my buss has bad springs, or shocks or 
something, because it looks like it sits low, so it gives me the 
impression I am level, when maybe I am not.

If there is too much oil in my westy, could that be why I am 
leaking? too much oil pressure? and if so, should I dump some out?

perterbed,
