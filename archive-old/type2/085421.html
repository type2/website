CG sends:

&gt; If he wants to use the bathroom of a big corporate gas station chain to take a
&gt; 'whore bath' and change his clothes - then what business is it of yours? Is
&gt; there a 'minimum pruchase' to use a bathroom? Haven't they taken enough money
&gt; from us?

He could always go to truck stops and use the bathroom facilities there--
most if not all large truck stops have shower rooms. No shower facilities in
those Class 8 trucks, y'know?
