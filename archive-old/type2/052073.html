&gt;I could do that, people are more than willing to display VW's trade dress on
&gt;everything from their cars to their websites to their ears, and so far, VWoA
&gt;hasn't figured this out.

Well, they do have many boutique items sold at the dealers. I have a two
jar set of genuine VW barbeque and marrinate sauce set. No manufactures
name appears at all. Only the blue genuine VW logo. Very trick for tailgate
parties. Note the genuine ball caps they sell are the very high quality
items with genuine leather infinatly adjustable strap with heavy brass
latch. They hired someone to make them to their specifications, just like
the sauce and the spezial bottles they came in.

I think they are glad to miss the boat full of low spec wannabee products
that use their name or logo without authorization. Obviously if they felt
the need to accomadate the need for cheap in any of their products, they
never would have developed the good reputation that came from this attitude
that created the most successful post war automobiles world wide for many
years and are still holding their own in the face of the tremendous
competition of latter years.
