&gt;are there spare tire mounts i can get for the front of a '71? I'd like to
&gt;put the spareup there so i can build a cabinet in the back. seems like a
&gt;waste of space when the tire could be outside.


Congrats on the new bus.  I looked at your photos and it appears to me that 
you already have a tire mount on the front.  I can even see an impression of 
where the spare may have lightly rubbed the paint. If the mount is actually 
missing you should be able to find one quite easily at a salvage yard.
