Subject: Re: [T2] Carbs or FI?

&gt; I have a running '79 Stock FI engine and I'm trying to decide what to do
&gt; when I rebuild the engine, I would like something larger (it's a 1800) but
&gt; can only find them Carborated.

Huh???  Unless someone replaced your engine with who-knows-what, your '79
Stock FI engine IS a 2 liter. That is the largest stock engine made.
