I had a gas station attendant fill the coolant reservior next to the oil fill 
tube behind the license plate. What other orifices have they gassed up?

My mother went driving my '80 Westi and ended up needing to get gas.  
Mind you I have a very intelligent mom, having owned a '71 Bus in the 
past.  Not having dealt with the Vanagon before she couldn't find the 
gas cap location so she opened up the rear license plate and found a 
cap to remove, so she proceeded to fill the crankcase with gasoline.
After taking VERY little gas she realized the error of her ways,
had it towed to the closest cheapo-oil-change place and rectified
the error.
