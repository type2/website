Subject: Leaky cold start valve?

I'm still diagnosing the running problem on my '79, which seems to be
loading up on fuel after a few minutes of running to the point of
ceasing to do so. My father and I spent some time poking around this
weekend. He's wondering if the valve has failed or is leaking, and he
suggested I try bypassing the coldstart valve with a length of fuel
line to see if that's the case.

I'm just wondering if any of you have had this problem, or if it would
even leak enough fuel to cause the problem I'm having. Basically, I'm
trying eliminate everything I can before jacking with the AFM. TIA,
and for all your help so far-
