Subject: Re: Change those *&amp;%*&amp;$ fuel lines!

Don't forget to check your fuel tank hoses.  I used to call my Vanagon, &quot;the SR-71&quot;, it drooled so much fuel after filling.  There are a lot of hoses, most without clamps, connecting the two upper parts of the tank to each other, to vents, and vapor recovery tanks.   All of mine were rotten.  Less hoses in earlier buses, but they need checking too.  Not sure how VW got away with a &quot;push fit&quot; filler neck into the fuel tank either, but that is another story.

Fuel line in correct metric sizes is common at FLAPS these days.  Injection engines need high pressure line, also common these days.  The major list suppliers all have correct hose in bulk, no real need for kits.  Change it all, it will be good for your heart.  Buy more clamps than you first think.  A new, fresh, fire extinguisher would be a nice  &quot;holiday&quot; present for any bus owner. jon
