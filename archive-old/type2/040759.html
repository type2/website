Jeff:
  Since your bus was running fine before the valve adjustment, and that's all you really did to it (simply having the distributor cap off as you turn the engine is not cause for harm), it seems pretty clear that the first thing to do is go back and tackle the valve adjustment again, with Muir in hand.  Hopefully  you didn't have any damage to a valve when you test drove it.
