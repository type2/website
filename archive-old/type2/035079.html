Subject: price tag my neg .02

    As I post this Im sure this thread is getting killed so lemme type
quick! Dont be discouraged if you  purchased the love of your life for
$700.00 and you love her just the way she is (you lucky bastard!) Although
spending 10k on a bus isnt out of the ordinary it IS through time. I myself
am approaching the 5k mark with the completion of my rebuild(not done by me)
But if I subtract all the repairs and such that Ive learned to do through
the list that at the time I payed for I would be well below the mark. Youll
eventually hit 10k its just a matter of when. 1year, 3years, 10 years? Its
still less then a cold and heartless car payment. Plus , how many people
look in thier driveway and say
&quot;Geesh, Im gonna have that F_at_RD Tempo FOREVER! I love it!!!&quot;
Im assuming NO ONE!!! ( I hope)
    As many have stated it always makes sense to have a back up vehicle it
all depends on the apllication of your bus. Mines a daily and if the rebuild
isnt complete by the middle of next week im screwed. (*gulp*)
Take Care All
Good Luck
Steve
