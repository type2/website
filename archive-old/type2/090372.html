&gt; Hey list,
&gt;
&gt; Looking at 185's vs. 195's on Tires for my 71 Westy (1600cc).......Got the
&gt; right tire it's just a matter of what width.. There are 185's on the bus
&gt; now...Thoughts , draw backs ????

The number _after_ the width is also important.  You want a tall section
tire, so the default (no /75, /70, etc) size is what you want.  That is,
you want a tire sized 185R14 (stock) or 195R14 (slightly larger), not
185/75R14 (too small) or 195/75R14 (slightly small in diameter)

Also check the maximum load number.  It should be 1540 pounds or more.
Load range letters can be deceptive, but the max load never lies.

Putting a set of 185R14 load range D (1700+ max load) tires on your bus
means never having to say you're sorry!
