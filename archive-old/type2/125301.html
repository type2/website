Subject: Re: [T2] Pacific Northwest Salvage Yards

&gt; Does anyone know of any VW salvage yards in the pacific northwest that may
&gt; have a good selection of baywindow project vans? I am looking for a 72 SC
or
&gt; DC, which seems harder to find than a split window bug.


I have seen very few yards that have buses in them period. I encountered one
camper at Dorris Auto in Hayward some months ago, but that seems to have
been a total fluke. I've been to that yard a bunch, and older VWs seem rare
there. Still, they have the advantage of being the only yard in the Bay Area
I have yet found to keep a running inventory of vehicles in their yard. In
other words, you can call and ask them if they have what you want, and they
will actually tell you if they have it.

A little goldmine I hit upon recently was the Pic 'n Pull in Newark. There
were buses and campers o'plenty, though most were pretty picked over. But
still, there were so many that I have to believe that it wasn't a
coincidence. I mean, all these other yards have nothing and this one had
about a dozen. To me, it seems like their inventory buyer is someone who
understands the value of them, and that most other buyers don't get it. The
down-side to this place is that, like almost all the others, they won't tell
you what they have in stock.

One quick tip is that most yards in the Sacramento area, the last time I
checked (though it has been some years), will tell you what they have if you
call.
