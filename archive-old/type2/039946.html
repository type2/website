In the summer of 1979, while on a car trip, [a rented car, not a bus 
thankfully] we ran into a hailstorm in eastern Colorado that was biblical in 
proportion. In a matter of minutes, our car, along with several hundred 
others, was reduced to barely drivable junk metal. We had to pull over to the 
side of the road, pull our sleeping bags out of the back seat, open them up, 
and hold them up against the windshield  to keep it from coming in on us. The 
noise was unbelievable. Somewhere in my picture archives I have a photograph 
of the chunk of ice that shattered our windshield-it's the size of a 
softball. The ground for miles around was absolutely white-with ice cubes. 
The sky had been the scariest shade of pea soup green I've ever seen, but was 
blue and clear afterwards. At the next exit, the truck stop parking lot was 
full to overflowing with cars and trucks with shattered windows, and dented 
sheetmetal. Our rental, a brand new car with only ten miles on it when we got 
it, looked as though someone had worked it over with a hammer. Several people 
were hurt to various degrees, and one Motorcyclist was nearly killed by the 
hail. There aint no place to hide from Mother Nature in Eastern Colorado. 
'Bout the scariest car trip story I got, or ever hope to have.  So keep yer 
eyes on the skies when yer crossing the plains......and when the tow truck 
comes out to haul in the remains...just reach fer yer wallet, and doncha 
complain...it could be a bucket full of yer brains...
