Subject: ?FLAPS?

When I first joined the list I saw many people talking about going to the 
nearest FLAPS and getting the stuff that they needed. I thought &quot;Hmmm, I have 
never heard of a place called FLAPS, and i have traveled across the country 
twice with plenty of parts store stops.&quot;  One day I had this realization that 
it probly stood for something (the fact  that its always capatilized hinted 
this). &quot;So what could it stand for,&quot; I asked? Frequented Local Auto Parts 
Store? Freakin Lame Ass Parts Store? (that covers most in my area).  I dont 
know...  Somebody please tell me?
