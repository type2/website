&gt; My 78 Westy was found damaged in downtown Vancouver in a parking lot

congratulations on the recovery.

&gt; and it
&gt; was towed by a towing company for not having a ticket on the dash.  I
&gt; haven`t been able to get to Vancouver to see it, but my insurance
&gt; company
&gt; has told me that my policy only allows me to have it towed to a
&gt; company of
&gt; my choosing in the Vancouver area for repair work.  It will not tow

how far we talking about??  do you have CAA towing they will usually tow a
certain distance I think stolen car counts for a tow.

if you have someone in Victoria you trust it may be worth it to trailer it
back..  a U-haul with 4 wheel trailer is not all that expensive, and you
never know it may be drivable. maybe someone in the area could check it
out.

good luck on getting your baby back home
