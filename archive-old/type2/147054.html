Subject: Re: [T2] Leaking aux air regulator?

Yeah, what was happening was that you were allowing unmetered air into 
the throttle body.  When you'd pinch it, it'd close off that air source 
and then the AFM would notice an increase of airflow through itself.

Just so you know, if you have a leaky aux air regulator, you will have a 
higher idle because all it's doing is allowing air to bypass the 
throttle vane, similar to the idle screw.  Kinda like if you left the 
aux air regulator unplugged... idle would just stay high.

Glad you got it fixed cuz it's never good to let in unfiltered air.
