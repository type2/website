&gt; Jon,
&gt; Thanks for the reply.
&gt; I am almost positive that my test port is threaded.  It has been a little while (last Fall), but I've had it out before and I remember it being a very small threaded plug. I am 99% positive!
&gt; I am meaning the plug on the driver's side fuel rail a short distance from the firewall.  I am assuming that this is the test port?  Is there another place to test the pressure?  Did some have threaded plugs and others not?
&gt; What holds the non threaded plug in the rail against the fuel pressure?
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; Greg

my 78 fuel rail is indeed threaded but when I put the fuel presure gauge
on I just used a short section of FI hose the right size and two hose
clamps and pulled em down tight, never leaked a drop. we're only talking
30-40PSI here
