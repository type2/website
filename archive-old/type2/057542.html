Subject: other uses for vw engines / flaming bus
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Hello,

I was just reading up on the list and thinking about the occasional mentions
of
VW engines being used for powering other devices.  Here is what I know of:

Volks-Air compressor
home built airplanes
ultra-lites
a sawmill (as mentioned in the cooling tin thread)
irrigation pumps in rural areas
I think I heard once that there was a generator kit
and of course the volks liner boat

Anybody have any additions to this list?

OBC:  After stupidly selling our 73 bus, we recently got it back, but the
driver
side carb had caught on fire.  Luckily the temporary owner had a fire
extinguisher, and the damage was minimal.  Just burned the insulation of
some
wiring, toasted the engine seal, and melted down the air filter.  What would
anyone suggest to repair this situation.  We intend to do a full blown top
to
bottom restoration on it, and I was thinking that the best route woule be to
go
ahead and pull the engine, and give it a good going over or rebuild if
needed to
be certain our project won't go up in smoke.  ANyone have any idea why that
carb would burn?  Oh yeah.. he said it would still start and idle.  I
haven't tried
this....

Thanks,

Darren McLaughlin
