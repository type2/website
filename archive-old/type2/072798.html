Subject: Re: Lifters

&gt;Getting that sinking, sick feeling... So, um... What happens if you adjust
&gt;hydraulics as if they were regular lifters? Mike, could you forward any
&gt;replies you get, that don't go to the list?

&gt;Kate

&gt;Oh, and BTW, for those of you that asked, the thing that finally got
&gt;Skutter started, was to tighten up the valves.&gt;

Listees in Seattle.....Kate needs help!

Though I've never done this, my guess is that if you have hydraulics and
adjust them like solid lifters, you might loose power and have difficulty
starting etc, due to improper valve timing.  Sound familiar?  It doesn't
seem to me that you would do any major damage to the engine by doing this,
but you would get a lot more valve clatter.  You should probably check the
archives on hydraulic lifters, but I thought I read somewhere that you
could tell if you have hydraulics by yanking the valve cover on cyls. 1-2,
setting engine to #1 TDC, then pressing down firmly on the push rod side
(bottom) of the rocker arm.  If you have any sponginess or give at all, you
have hydraulics.

Keep the faith.  This thing has got to run.
