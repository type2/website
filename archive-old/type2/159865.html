Subject: Re: [T2] loose cam bearing?

Airic wrote:
&gt; almost sounds like a weak valve spring, or lifter, but it would be hard to
&gt; diagnose with out knowing the frequency.  It must be at the camshaft
&gt; frequency to make you mechanic guess that it was a bearing.   If the bearing
&gt; bore was too large, which is hardly possible with a type 4, i could imagine
&gt; a cam bearing.

&gt; Do the lifters take a long time to pump up every time?  even after being
&gt; shut down for short period of time &lt;1 hour?


No, the lifters seem to pump up in the normal timeframe. First thing in 
the AM they are a little noisy for less than a minute, then quite down 
usually and I won't hear them for the rest of the day, almost no matter 
how long I go in between drives.

&gt; Is oil pressure good?  Is compression good?  another thing it could be is a
&gt; loose cam gear on the shaft.

Oil pressure is good I think. It sorta hovers around 35 PSI at idle, as 
it surges up and down.

Im not sure about the compression, it doesn't seem to have any loss in 
power. Im a little afraid of doing the compression test because of my 
CHT sender on the #3 side, pulling all of that tin apart again to make 
sure it doesn't get messed up when pulling that plug scares me.

&gt; Is it an automatic?

Manual transmission.

I actually recorded some audio of this sound, if that helps.
Ill try and get it uploaded here in a bit.

Thanks,
Chris
