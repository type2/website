&gt; Any comments on using autoclubs?  Is Tipple-A the best deal, or should I

not sure about all of them but tipple(sic)-a yanked me off the interstate
when a &quot;new&quot; bearing shattered, even sent the requested roll-back and
hauled me about 70 miles to my garage and set it down right in front.
cost nadda, show the card, my membership and cell phone paid for
