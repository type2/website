&gt;At Home Despot, I bought some thin indoor/outdoor type carpet that
&gt;DOESN'T FRAY when cut.  The back doesn't look like the back of regular

Rodney gives good advice, I have a couple ideas to add from my experience.
I found a really cheap rug that I liked and cut to fit my '71.  I found out
that binding it would cost more than the carpet, and since I don't have any
heavy duty needles/sewing machine I couldn't bind it myself.  I did have a
glue gun and a bunch of glue sticks, so I just cut the carpet neatly and ran
down the edges with the glue gun.  The carpet hasn't unraveled in over a
year so I guess it worked.

Recently I noticed in Home Depot some nice self adhesive tiles that had some
attractive wood patterns.  I think the price ranged from $1-$1.22/tile and
you'd probably need maybe 15 or less to do the floor.  I might go this route
on my bus next spring.  One of the patterns had some &quot;wood&quot; highlights that
was a very close color match to the 68-73 westfalia plastic cabinet veneer.

While these tiles will be cold on your feet when camping and not as sound
deadening as carpet, I figure they clean up nicely and I can always place a
throw rug over it for camping.
