&lt;&lt; If I go over speed bumps too fast. The back end sounds like the engine
is about too fall out. It's a hard jarring sound that occurs when coming
off the speed bump. Yea I know, drive over speed bumps slower. I checked
the motor and engine mounts, the shocks, half shafts, etc. Everything
seems in good condition. Anything else to check? Does everyone else
suffer these sounds when they go over a speed bump too fast.

You could be bottoming out and slamming the &quot;bump stops&quot; in the rear...
What kind and how old are the shock absorbers in the rear? Are the rear
torsion arms set up correctly and level - If the Bus sags at the rear, you
lose suspension travel making it easier to bottom out. My first best guess
would still be shocks...Check again to see if the rubber donuts at the top
and bottom of the shock mounts are in good shape...
