Subject: It's all in the oil(was re:half my engines siezed)

Hi guys here's an update on my post of a couple days ago,

     I got the engine pulled out of the westy today and all torn apart, I
must say getting a bus 3 feet off the ground and crawling under it is much
more intimidating than working on a bug. BE CAREFULL HERE!! My father owns
several peices of large equipement so I borrowed four 12 ton jack stands 1
for each corner. But overall I like the larger size and layout(everything
but where the gas tank is), I'm a big boy so I find things fit me a little
better and I like the layout better. Not to mention a bus actually has what
resembles a frame!!

    Well  after getting the greasy hulk onto the engine stand I started
looking the engine over letting my mind absorb this  beast they call the
type 4. Until today I'd never worked on one or touched one for that matter.
The type 4 is definitely the big block of air cooled motors, it makes the
type 1 look so  damn small in comparison :)  I don't know how they cram
these things into beetles cause I propped it up next to my 62 and it looks
like it would never fit, but i digress. I was also pleased to find out its
actually a 2 litre, and not a 1.7 like I thought it was. Not that 2 litres
are all that rare, but it seems like all the 2 litres around here are in
some one elses van!!

    Well first order of business was to drain the oil and remove the filter
and screen, right away I noticed something strange, the oil was coming out
very blue and very thin. I stuck my finger in it and smelled it and sure
enough my fears had come true, it was two stroke oil! It suddenly made sense
why there were two empty out board oil bottles under the front seat!  Damn
this thing musta smoked so bad I dont know why someone didnt think someting
was wrong but never the less. Figuring things would be totally ruined or
seized  I figured I hadn't  a whole lot to loose so I began tearing it
apart. I found a few unexpected goodies like a new 009 dist with pertronix
ign. Just this is worth what I paid for the bus! Well  after I got the heads
off  the shear amount of carbon  I found present was amzing!! In each
cylinder there was the equivlenlant of at least 3 table spoons just sitting
there. How it ran for so long is beyond me, the good news was once I removed
both heads  and cleaned out the carbon, the engine turned over free as can
be. It was essentially hydraulic lock but with solids instead of liquids.
(good guess James)

    Everything  else came apart with out a hitch except the fact that the
wrist pins are held in with circlips and I didn't have circlip pliers but
that didn't stop me. When I actually got the case apart and started looking
over the crank and rods I was amazed at what I found, everything looked
excellent except #3  journal which suffered from a spun rod bearing. But the
good news is the crank can be turned as it is a std std crank right now so a
.010 cut should clean her up nicely. Just thought I'd update you guys on
what was wrong. And a big thanks to everyone who offered suggestions! all
fer now
