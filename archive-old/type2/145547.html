Subject: Re: [T2] Clutch problem

i could be way off here roberto but sounds to me like something around the throw out bearing and the pressure plate isnt right???
  like maybe the throw out bearing is hangin on one clip or maybe hangin up in the pressure plate but i am not sure about that....?
  good luck... maybe a greasy guru can help better with that one that I.
  i am just phishN here......

  Hello guys

After installed a new clutch set (throw-out bearing, disc and pressure 
palte) , I found if I pushed the clutch pedal all the way down I was unable 
to engage any gear but if I pushed half way the gears engage easily so I 
gave a less tension to the calbe and did a test drive with out problems I 
let the car parked all nigth long with a reverse engage, this morning it was 
almost imposible to disengage the gear with the engine runing or not, after 
a while I manage my self to free the shifter and ride the car againg but 
this time was terrible the way the gears engage if they finally does.
I took the flywheel to be resurfaced and have no free play in the pedal.
Any help will be higly apreciate like always.
Thanks in advance


Roberto
