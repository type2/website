Subject: Bus Campout New Years Eve

you imagine a better way to bring in the new year!!

NEW BUS RESOLUTION II: brought to you by the FULL MOON BUS CLUB
DATES:  DEC 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 2002  and JAN 1, 2003
come-n-camp as many nights as you can, even if it's only new years eve

LINK TO MAIN SITE:
http://www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_net/nbrc/nbrmain.htm

NEW:  We are going to have a sit-down group holiday dinner at a local 
restaraunt, this will allow us all to sit around the same table. We are 
having this special dinner on saturday night. If you planning to attend 
please email me and let me know - so we can arrange transportation.   email: 
  buddavw_at_hotmail_dot_com

They do have cabin and cottage rentals in this campground,  so if your too 
warm blooded for cold camping in a bus, then come and rent a cabin. You'll 
be able to sleep in cozy comfort but still mingle with all the buses.  Call 
the campground for info on cabin rentals. The campground phone # is: 
(864)576-0302.


You will NOT need to call and make reservations if your camping in your bus, 
but you can if you like:      They are not very busy at this time of year, 
so we will almost have the entire place to ourselves.



DIRECTIONS TO CAMPGROUND:   Take I-26 away from Spartanburg (towards 
Columbia, SC) and take Exit 28: HWY 221.   Take HWY 221 NORTH, approx. 200 
feet to light, and turn right on &quot;Stillhouse Road&quot;.  Go one mile to Stop 
Sign and take left on &quot;Ott Shoals Road&quot;...go 1.5 miles and see campground 
signs on the left.
