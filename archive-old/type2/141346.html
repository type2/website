&gt; Scott,
&gt; Well, I discovered why I drive my van. I was reminded.
&gt; For one thing, it is fun.

That is sooo true!


&gt; Even with the hitch on it, it still handles the same, which is poorly.

Ok,,, was the &quot;hitch&quot; supposed to make it handle any differently?  I thought it
was for carrying bikes, or trailers?


&gt; It does not like to corner and you need lots of room to brake. This is
&gt; all normal, so I drive the speed that I would like to end up in the
&gt; ditch at.
&gt;
&gt; While driving at 80, I notice I am looking at more scenery and enjoying
&gt; the touring.


Well,, maybe you better slow down!,,, oh,, are you talking 80 Km/hr ??


&gt; Also, people love to follow me as they are always there when I look in
&gt; the rear view mirror.


You mean your the pie'd piper of Prince Edward Island??  I think Muir has a
picture of you driving along and everyone else waiting to get by..er I mean
following along!  LOL
 ....
&gt; Cheers,
