Subject: parting a 68 double
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

A while back I picked up a 68 double cab with hopes of
restoreing it. Well time has passed and I aquired a 68
single cab, house and soon 2 more cars. I have been
harvesting parts from it and i need the front beam for
a friends singlecab. It is very rusty on the lower
portion but has a decent roof section. I am gonna
start cutting it up soon (yes its that bad) and
figured id offer up teh parts to the list before I
take them to the swap.I am not selling any thing from
the bed As I will be making a trailer to tow behind
the single.

Thanks---Bryan
