Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

Anything is possible. While down in Mexico last summer I saw plenty of Bay
windows driving around with watercooled engines in the back and a factory
radiator in the front. This is not a home conversion, the VW plant in Mexico
makes these as well as the newer Vanagon. The Mexicans have taken the
original vehicles of Germany and in my opinion improved them in many ways.
H20 powered Bays, their own version of F.I. for the bugs, homemade
convertible versions, even their own Westy conversion that is much better
than the originals. If you want a diesel westy, get a Mexican H2O Bay, and
swap out the gas engine for a diesel from an Audi or whatever makes you
happy. How about a new Golf diesel engine?? Bet that would haul nicely.

A rather brilliant and accomplished mechanic that I lean heavily on here
in Toronto once retrofitted a Rabbit diesel engine into a late Baywindow.
Took him a few months of figuring out mounting points, how to route the
watercooled lines, etc., but he loves diesels and really wanted a Bay with
a diesel in it as a personal project (this was when he was still living in
Europe).
 
He got it up and running and working great, and found that it was so
dog-slow as to be almost unuseable, I think partially a problem with the
gear ratios. I don't know too many details. Anyway, he sold it to a friend
who drove it about 200,000 kms happily all around Europe.
 
That very well may be the only diesel Bay in existence.
