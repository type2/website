 &gt; Two possible options for you, Bob:
 &gt; 
 &gt; 1. buy an air tank and fill it at a service station. ($30+ ...and you'll
 &gt; need the right kind of hose and nozzle.)

If you shop around you can get a hose and nozzle for less than $20.  I got a 
50 foot hose at pricecostcoclublandmart for about $10 and an OSHA approved 
nozzle at a local chain hardware store (Orchard Supply for the curious).

 &gt; 2. go to the electronics/computer section of a local gadget store and buy
 &gt; a small can of compressed air for $2-3.
 
Or 3: watch garage sales for compressors.  I got my 22 gallon 5HP compressor 
for $60 at a garage sale.  Works great; I don't know how I ever lived without 
it.
