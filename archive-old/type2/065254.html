Subject: Re: Vacuum gauge

I hooked up my vacuum guage this weekend and heres how it went.  I hooked
it up the little port on the right hand side side of the air intake 
distributor.  NOTE:  without this hose connected the bus will run very rough,
of course the vacuum guage makes it run normally.  The reading was holding 
steady around 17 inches of mercury at idle.  When the accerator was pressed
the guage drops slighly.  When the accelerator is let go, the guage shoots
up momentarily and then drops back to 17.  This seems good to me, any 
opinions?
