Has anyone come up with a good replacement cap for a 71.
I can't put .5 of  tank without gas coming out of the filler.

Also I just drop it off to have the generator done the pulley spilt in =
half.  So looks that I will go with the alternator instead. Going to =
have the clutch, hoses, electronic ignition, new engine seals.

Hope this keeps her running for a long time the engine is strong.

Is there anything the rest of you can think of while she a part that I =
should have done?
