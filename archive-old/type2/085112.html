Subject: Re: Body Question

I find that if you are welding infrequently and doing primarily short or
spot welds (as much body work is) then flux core is perfectly adequate and
it's hard to justify the cost of a regulator and a bottle of gas. If you are
trying to run some nice beads though flux core spatters too much.

So if you are welding in a rust repair panel that your are going to take a
flap wheel to anyway why not just use flux core. If you are making your own
roof rack however use gas.

&gt;&gt; Recommendations on wire choices, flux coated preferably.
&gt;
&gt;use plain wire and mixed gas.
