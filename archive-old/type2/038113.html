&gt;&gt;When you install the oil cooler on a type4 engine - make sure the thick

&gt;&gt;smaller washers.&lt;&lt;

Been there, done that!  I was following the procedure in the Haynes manual
which is dead wrong.  (still pisses me off just thinking about it)  The
worst part is you don't find out til you try to start the engine and wind
up with a bunch of oil on the ground.  Then you gotta take the fan shroud
off which is a royal PITA.
