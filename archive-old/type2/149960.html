I just got a complete tin kit from Empi and it came with one. I bet Empi
sells just the rubber seal.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am looking for an oil cooler duct seal....the rectangular gasket/seal
&gt; for the tin over the oil cooler (part # 021-119-329). Bus depot has it
&gt; on their web page but would have to order it from VW:-( That would take
&gt; a while.....any other volks out there know if another vendor has any
&gt; that they have ordered recently? Anyone have an extra that they want to
&gt; sell? Just thought I would ask.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; Meg
