Subject: Re: VW Bus Artwork for the asking

For those of you still enquiring about the VW Bus drawings, H Stephen 
Dolan's webpage still has my VW Bus drawings that you can download 
easily:

http://www2.ari_dot_net/dworkin/vw/

Do what you want with the artwork; I'm making it available to all, to 
use however you want, for free.  If you're going to have this tatooed on 
your body, or make posters, stickers or whatever from this stuff, I 
suggest downloading the larger, crisper images (300 dpi).


Have fun,

Roy
