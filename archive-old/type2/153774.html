Subject: RE: Wobbly Steering!

Check the center pin on the front axle an which the steering assembly
pivots. Not sure what this thing is called. When the bushings wear out, it
will not just pivot but also wobble up and down when you turn the steering
wheel. Ball joints do not have much of an effect on steering, but this thing
and all tie rod ends do.

Are there any other pieces that need to replaced with respect to the
steering that would wear? Those three items were the only things that I saw
that could be replaced. Anything else I might be missing?
