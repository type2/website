Those bumpers are pretty spendy!!!!!!

There are places that restore bumpers. Old craftsman like fellows 
with hammers and dollies reshape them. Holes are welded up. Gouges 
are leaded. DocRic had some done for his soon to be finished :) 1971 
resto. They looked great and I am pretty certain it did not cost $700 
to get it done.

BTW, 1972 model year buses have a one year only rear bumper.
