Subject: Re: [T2] '77 Manual Tranny into '73 Bus

&gt;From: dworkin I just happened to drop in on a thread I know womething 
&gt;about.  I have a
&gt;'73 that sports the trans out of a '79 (with an '80 block).  My comments:

Hey thanks Steve,

I didn't read this until after my first post this morning, but that is a 
very incouraging post. What kind of differences did you notice with the 
swap? If this one goes through the engine will be an increase as well. More 
power, better highway performance, better city driving, anything that would 
be considered a worse than before point.

&gt;While I think that flopping nose cones will help shorten the shift rod, it
&gt;can be done on a direct flop; I know, I have.

Did you change out the shift rod/s?

&gt;If you intend to install the FI (and I HIGHLY recommend this!) then you
&gt;need to flop the transmission support bar across the top of the trans.

I would too, but it is not my bus. I am curious in the difference of the 
support bars. How are they different?
