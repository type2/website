Subject: VW official website fun

Howdy all. I've been playing around at the new official Volkswagen website, and
thought I'd invite everyone to go over and sign up for the official VW owners
club, register to get free stuff sent in the mail, and all that fun stuff.
They've really been working on the site, and it's coming along. I look forward
to getting all the mail!
the new URL is:
http://www.vw_dot_com/welcome.htm
but you can get there from the old one as well.
They finally acknowledge us as well, the owners of older models, and the car
shows and such...
