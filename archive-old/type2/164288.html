Subject: RE: [T2] Replacing just the electrical part of late bay
  ignition switch

&quot;Hey listees, I read the article in the Type 2 library tech bulletins about
redoing the ignition switch on a late bay, and it looks like the electrical
part of the switch is just held in with a small grub screw. All I want to do
is replace the electrical part; the mechanical key part is fine. Has anyone
done this replacement WITHOUT removing the whole column as advised by this
article?&quot;
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A number of years ago I replaced just the electrical portion of the ignition
switch in our '71 with the column and switch in place.  I didn't take any
notes or photos but I don't remember it being overly difficult.  I'm sure I
would have remembered if I had run into problems.  Sorry I can't be any more
specific.
