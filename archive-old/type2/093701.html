&lt;&lt; Ok, so I went to fix this gas leak under my bus.  It was leaking from what 
appeared to be a pressure regulator.  I have not seen any mention of this in 
the bentley bible.  Anyways, it says &quot;profuel&quot; on it and has I believe four 
different settings.  I could not pay that much attention, because I was 
taking a gasoline bath trying to fix this damn leak.  The gas lines to this 
thing were pretty bad.  My question is this...is this a stock item for a 73 
bus and is it needed?

Not stock...Might be a Purolator product. Chrome with a dial? Do you have the
stock fuel pump? Carbs?
