Here's the URL of a web page giving info. on the Pertronix &quot;Ignitor II&quot;.
http://www.bowwowvw_dot_com/new.htm

************************************

&gt;200-400% improvement = what ?
&gt;Did the ad give specifics as to what these improvements were? Seems like a
&gt;pretty broad claim unless they were comparing their's to, say, no ignition...
