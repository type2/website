Message-ID: &lt;19990714012803.24423.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I have a 79 type 2 with fuel injection.  I am not sure of the proper
&gt;hook up on the vacuum lines from the distributor to the intake air
&gt;distributor, decel valve and fuel pressure regulator.  I have looked in
&gt;many places and there are no diagrams that show the complete vacumm
&gt;system hooked.
&gt;Can someone please help!!!!!

Jeez, as many times as this comes up, I have replied both to the list and 
listee. Doesn't any of these answers show up in the archives? Like under 
'hoses' or 'vacuum hoses'?

For the umpteenth time:

You have two sources of vacuum. Ported and manifold.
Ported vacuum appears when you open the throttle. Ported vacuum is used on 
the vacuum advance and EEC purge valve on theback of the air cleaner. Ported 
vacuum comes from the nipple on the front of the throttle housing.
Manifold vacuum appears when you are idling. It is used on the retard side 
of the dist. vacuum unit, the decel valve, and the fuel pressure regulator.

You need 2 tees hook up your 79 correctly.
&gt;From throttle housing nipple --&gt; tee --&gt; vacuum advance and purge valve.
&gt;From nipple on plenum between #1 + #2 intake runners --&gt; tee --&gt; decel valve 
and pressure regulator.
