&gt;Hi.
&gt;       I am going to fit  2.2 litre 911 Porsche and 5 speed to my 73 
&gt; Kombi. Has
&gt;any one on the list done this or can you point me in the direction of any
&gt;information on this conversion.
&gt;All and any help mst gratefully recieved.

If I was going to do this swap, rather than take all the Porsche parts and 
adapt them to the Bus, I would adapt the Bus to the Porsche. You cut out 
the Porsche pan with complete suspension, brakes, driver train. Then cut 
the pan out of the Bus.

You lengthen the Porsche pan to the Bus spec. You adjust the suspension to 
Bus height, then set the Bus body on and weld the two together. Put the 
Porsche gauges in the VW dash. Now you have a wholly Porsche serviceable 
chassis with a VW serviceable body. You will need to upgrade the torsion 
arms, and the beauty of the 911 tranny is, you can get ANY gears you need 
to match the new vehicle to the new weight/torque ratio. Because of the 
extra weight, I would install Turbo CV's and brakes, but with Porsche 
that's bolt on easy. I would probably also adapted the whole Porsche wiring 
harness for all the Porsche switches and gauges. It would just be a nice 
finishing touch. I got a 911 wood steering wheel and Fuchs allows if anyone 
wants the coupe de gras.
