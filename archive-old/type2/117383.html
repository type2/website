&gt; I've had a steady leak from my dipstick on the 'front' side of the engine.
&gt; This oil seemed innocuous - just kept the fan and heads getting corroding as
&gt; it was sucked into the cooling fan. But I think my recent alternator failure
&gt; could be partially attributed to this leak. The alternator cooling duct was
&gt; dripping with oil when I changed it.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there something I'm missing on my dipstick?

probably the little rubber boot is leaking, this thing is really well
hidden so in your Bentley look in chapter 5 on page 25 the figure 9-1 part
labeled #12 is the culprit
