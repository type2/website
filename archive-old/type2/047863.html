Subject: Re: [T2] Westy tent set up ?

It's pretty straightforward puzzle if the 2 T's and the corner pieces are
still color-coded. The red set goes to the backside of the tent, where the
bus parks; the green side goes to the front. Green and red corners have
slightly different angles, hence should not be interchanged. This is
important because there is a downward slope to the roof from the bus side to
the front side of the tent.

Set up and connect the poles first, with the vertical leg poles still
collapsed. Then hook up the tent, starting with the middle. Finally, raise
the tent by progressively lengthening the leg poles.
