Subject: Wild rear disk brakes and stub axle question

The guy at my flaps sent me to another customer
of his who is really into rail buggies.  Unlike
most of the rail buggie types, he likes bugs and
busses.  He does remove the trannies out of the
busses, but leaves them in fairly good condition
and loves to get rid of the parts instead of
hacking them up with torches and crushing the
rest once the tranny is gone.  

Anyway, he has this weird setup on his rail
buggy.  Late bus disks all the way around.  The
front probably won't surprise anyone but the rear
was the front disk with some wide five
contraption attached (bolted? welded?) to it sort
of like a spacer.  It appeared to the outermost
face of the drum of an early bus.  We swore it
would be the thing for my bus too.  I'll take the
dig camera next time and show you folks. 

He also was searching for a bus stub axle like
the one that came off of the buggy.  It is 9 1/4
inches long, measured in an A to C fashion using
the normal  
    C
A   B

The stub axle off a late bus (76-77) was only 8
1/4 long.  Any ideas of which stub axle is 9 1/4?
 I'll take photos of this if necessary to
identify the part.

Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Bus Captain
