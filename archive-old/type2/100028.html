Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 Rear Wheel Bearings?  HELP!

Original Message from Dave Wolfanger  10/1/02 9:24 PM
Thanks for the plug Dave, I wish I could loan this out to all the bus people
in order to save everyone the hard job of greasing their bus rear wheel
bearings and CV's  By keeping bearings greased it saves the hardest and most
expensive job of replacing the bearings!!  I have and will loan it locally
and the people who have used it, love it.

This list is a great resource for all of us who love our busses and want to
keep them on the road, but can't afford to have someone else maintain them.
And really, the feel of correctly completing a repair is part of the fun
owning a bus.

 
&gt; Paging Rick Taylor - I recall he has invented a grease tool for this
&gt; normally unserviced item.
