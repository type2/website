Subject: heat and noise in a vw bus

somebody mentioned here the other day embarking on the process of dealing with the above mentioned problems according to the t2 archive entry of the same name, using the q-pad and koolpatch and all of that.

I just wanted to encourage them to discuss the process on the list, as I am considering undertaking it at the end of the year.

thanks,

Busdriver X
