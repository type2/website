Wow!  Thank you for the speedy reply.  Well, I was hoping to find a listing
of VW bus mechanics (or even just ONE mechanic) in the South Bend, Indiana
(Northern Indiana/Southwestern Michigan)area.  My husband and I bought a
1977 bus (with only 70,000 miles on the original engine) in May and since
then have had a variety of mechanical troubles to deal with.  I think we
have put close to $2,300.00 into it in seven months. We are debating on
whether to continue to fix the problems or cut our losses and sell it.  The
body is beautiful and the interior is immaculate, so we don't want to sell
it.  Well, we can't even really think of selling it until we fix it now.
It appears that our current problem is a messed up gear box....it was stuck
in first gear, then it was stuck in reverse, and now after we had it towed
to our house is in neutral. Do you have any advice or know of anyone in our
area that could help us out?  Thanks in advance!  
Heather
