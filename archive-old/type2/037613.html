Subject: New (stock) muffler install

Success is mine! I just got done installing Wendelin's new stock muffler
($159.95 for the kit from Bus Depot). It went swimmingly! I'd been
treating the old nuts with WD-40 and they gave me minimal trouble.
Didn't have to resort to the Dremel tool. The install went smoothly, no
cutting of studs or persuading with BFH required. I just lined up the
studs on the new muffler with the holes in the heat exchangers, started
the new nuts on, and tightened 'em down (first one side, then the
other). I treated the threads going into the muffler with Loctite --
they were a little too easy to thread out of the metal -- and the
threads for the nuts with anti-seize, so hopefully the next exchange
will go just as well.

I can understand the preference for the extractor-type exhaust -- double
the options for removing/installing recalcitrant nuts, one on each end
of the stud. I found a big hole in my old muffler when I got under there
to remove the whole shebang. No wonder it was so noisy!

Ah, but my victory is bittersweet. Just as I was tightening down the
last bolt, as twilight fell and a chill breeze came up off the ocean, I
remembered the new heat shield I forgot to install! Drat, dang nabbit!
I've got the rear three pieces of engine tin out and I was going to
clean up and replace the middle and right pieces. So.._dot_can the heat
shield be installed from the top? Is this really hard?

Figures -- the whole thing just went way too well.

Nikki
