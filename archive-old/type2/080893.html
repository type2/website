Subject: Re: [T2] Curtains

I did not have the problem of removing the cabinet window curtain because
when I acquired the bus there was none. To install one I cut a piece of 1/8&quot;
plywood slightly larger than the window itself and covered it with the same
curtain material I used to make new curtain for the rest of the bus, then
slid it in through the open front cabinet door. It was snug but I was able
to work it all the way in and to the back. Then I screwed it in place front
and rear, using access gained again from the front cabinet door and also
from the folddown back cabinet door.

This solution worked well for me for. In addition to holding the material
the plywood which is slightly deeper than the window also works as a that
backing of cabinet.

I cannot recall now whether it would have been possible to have removed an
existing curtain/curtain rod this way. If not it still may be possible to do
what I did and slide a curtain material-covered piece of plywood in front of
an existing curtain.

Cheers,

John Rogers

&gt;
&gt; It's quite easy............once you remove the cabinet.
&gt; Unfortunately, as per The Bentley, you must first remove the icebox
cabinet,
&gt; the storage shelf, the rear facing seat, and the rear bench seat (bed).
&gt; Guess why the PO didn't replace that curtain?

&gt; Sorry, no shortcut on this one.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe painting the outside of the window with Jerry Bears, star swirls, or
&gt; whatever
&gt; blends into the motif of your bus, would be the easiest solution to your
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; Me, I pulled out all of that stuff anyway, to deal with a little rust
&gt; beginning on the floor,
&gt; and to put noise deadening panels in--so I just replaced the curtains with
&gt; ones that
&gt; match the others I put in.
