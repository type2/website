&gt;   i am going to pick up a hightop up north but in case i cant make it i want to consider having it shipped...
&gt;
&gt;   i do not know a few things about this top like.
&gt;   how long? how wide? how tall is it? and how heavy?
&gt;
&gt;   also can anyone reccomend someone that can ship it...since that might be a more seasonable thing to do i am thinking depending on cost of course and i would love to see the north sometime exspecially since it is finally warm weather up there...in new hampshire...

the bottom is rather weak side to side so I would certainly reccomend
crateing it if you ship it commercial, in fact I suspect they would
require it..  I have used Yellow Freight without problems


personally if at all possible I would bring it back myself. a set of long
roof racks would probably hold it just high enough that it would clear the
pop top. lash it on real good and drive slow.  make sure there is at least
two &quot;Mechanical&quot; connections, ie. roof rack to roof rack to body so even
if it slipped it wouldn't fall off into traffic and cause an accident.

also before leaving MEASURE how tall you are. last thing you need is to
ruin it at the McDonalds' drive thru...

good luck
Bob
