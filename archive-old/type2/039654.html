Volks,

Does anybody have an ideas as to how long it takes for a Dometic propane 
fridge to get cold? I finally got mine fired up in my Riveria last night and 
let it run for almost a few hours and didn't really notice much difference 
in temperature. I ran out of propane before I could really tell so I 
couldn't let it run longer to see if it actually was getting colder, but I 
just thought I would ask if anybody knew any details on these fridges.

cheers....
Jeff
