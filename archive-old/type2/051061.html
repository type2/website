Subject: RE: [T2] E-brake woes

&gt; The point I'm making is that if you're having e-brake troubles, you might 
&gt; want to check the cable runs for damage. 

  Or, as in the case of my old '76 Westy, the e-brake levers are reversed.
The e-brake was inoperative when I bought the '76, despite the fact the PO
paid $280.00 for a brake job two months before I bought it. The shop had
gotten the levers mixed up.   Jeff S.
