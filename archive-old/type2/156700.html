No, it's because of the numerous victims of M$ security holes might want
to get some revenge.  Most of those holes are there intentionally because
Bill's ambition is to make you pay every time you use a piece of M$
software and he has to have control of your computer to collect.

&gt; Saw LOTS of those bullet proof sedans in Italy. Carried high-ish level
&gt; US and NATO leadership, and local officials. Friend who drove one said
&gt; the peformance was miserable unless you consider how much weight is
&gt; there...

That glass is really heavy.  The doors and floors aren't so bad anymore
since they starteed using Kevlar panels.  Unfortunately, you can't see
through Kevlar!
