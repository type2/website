Subject: Alternator light on dash is dim

The alternator light on dash comes on dim, and when I put just the emergency 
blinker lights on, I could see the alternator light pulse ever so slightly 
brighter as the emergency blinker lichts came on.

My fan belt is OK.

Could it be my regulator??  I haven't checked the voltage to the silver 
socket or cigarette lighter plug yet.  I haven't checked the battery for 
charge ot H2O.  The first time this dim alt light came on was last night
