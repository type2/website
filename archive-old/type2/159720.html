Subject: Re: [T2] Why is my 77 Westy running so cool???

Since our busses are &quot;fresh air&quot; heating systems, the heat is scavenged 
into the blown air from the exhaust gasses going past the heat exchanger 
fins in the heater boxes.  This is actually independent of engine 
temperature, affected only if cooler cylinders means cooler exhaust.
    Remember that the thermostat lets go when hot and so lets the flaps 
open up for more cooling to cylinders.  Check if your flaps actually are 
closed when cold.  Easy to do by pushing forward on the cable attachment 
to flap rod. Running it with proper thermostat, flaps, and cabling in 
place, but having missing tin under the thermostat/cylinders means 
thermostat should be fooled into staying closed longer than usual, as 
the hot air will dissipate before striking it.  This should result in 
hotter than usual cylinders and possibly, hotter exhaust gasses/hotter 
air to heat ducts?.
