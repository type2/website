&gt;minutes at 2,000 RPM as per the Wilson book and had to really bring out
&gt;the idle air screw. Then even at the point of the screw almost popping
&gt;out, the engine would still only idle erratically around 2,000,
&gt;sometimes spiking up and never constant. So I thought &quot;Aha! Vacuum
&gt;leak!&quot; and sprayed carb cleaner to every possible leakage spot along the

I ran into some problems as well which turned out to be a vacumn leak you
can't find with a can of carb cleaner or propane. I submitted a follow up
post a while back to a similar subject line. The problem was with the BRT
(big round thing). I know there is a name for it but don't know what is is
off hand. It is mounted on the air filter canister and controls the fuel
evaporation canister return line to the intake. If the diaphram leaks on the
BRT you can't get a steady idle. Just food for thought... Could be a few
other things too. Like fuel pressure regulator, or the AFM. This is easy to
test for though. Just block off the vacumn hose at the BRT. Actually I'm not
sure if a 78 bus is hooked up to the evap cansisters the same as my 79 but
if it is it's worth a try. May the force be with you...
