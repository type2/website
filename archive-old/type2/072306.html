The main reason I am having trouble with this, is, that I have no &quot;go by&quot; to 
check how it ought to look. This is my only carb system. My other two are FI, 
and the setup is very different. 

My return spring was in place, but I don't see how that weak of a spring 
could operate the system. I suspected a strong spring somewhere else (under 
the pedal) drove the footfeed.....

No?

Yes, LEA [sic], I can. The Oklahoma City police and the FBI have confirmed 
there is another bomb in the Federal Building. It's in the east side of the 
building. They've moved everybody back several blocks.
