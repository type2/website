Subject: Re: Bumper bolts....


Re: the size of the bolts I need to pick up to remount my front and rear bumper on my 71?

I just pulled and reinstalled the front bumper on my 69 Transporter - the front bolts (4) are 17mm
and the end bolts (4) are 13mm...Unfortunately I don't know if things changed by 71, but maybe that
helps?
