Subject: Re: [T2] Going nuts...upholstery

OK, I went and 'appropriated' a M code plate from a 78 Champagne bus. Build
date 02/78, vin # 2282098015
The 1st row verifies the vin:
08 098 015
The 2nd row is:
4817V1 D61 027 227
3rd row:
08 5 7198 UF 2218 61

The 1st group in the 2nd row is paint and upholstery.
I have not got a clue on how 4817 equals the 2 paint colors.....
But V1 is sienna [red brown] cloth. Although only the light gold insert is
cloth, the red brown is vinyl.

&gt;
&gt; Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I am going nuts trying to figure out what colors my 78 Champagne
&gt; Edition interior colors are supposed to be.  This is not a camper
&gt; which as I understand it did not have the cloth inserts.
&gt;
&gt; Remember, I am the guy with no mcode plate.  :-((
&gt;
&gt; They have cloth inserts.
&gt;
&gt; The vinyl appears to be a &quot;red&quot; color and the inserts where they have not
&gt; been exposed to the weather look to be kind of a bright &quot;rust&quot; color.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone give me a clue?  The insert color that I *think* is correct
&gt; does not appear in any selection for upholstery.
&gt;
&gt; I would really like to get this one right....
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave
