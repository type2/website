Hello again. I forgot to mention that I am looking for a good seal for 
my '78 2.0 litre. Any body have an extra one? I don't have the cash for 
one (saving for trip to Mexico this summer to get married) but have 
parts I could trade, such as an alternator or starter. 
Thanks alot.

Almost forgot, I'm in Seattle, WA.
                                  Simon
