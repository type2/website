Subject: My 914 bus/longish

Rebuild the 914 motor.

I had a 914 motor installed in my 1972 westy back in 1987. It was AWESOME
compared to the stock motor. IMHO. YMMV.

At least it was up until it threw a rod and punched a hole through the top
of the crankcase. But I would have to credit that to abuse, as I was
completely irresponsible in both my driving habits and maintenance in those
days. You haven't lived a completely full life until you've done a 55MPH
power-slide through a logging-road S-bend at the top of third gear.
ZOOM!!!!!

(Thanks for retrieving that warm, happy memory. Now I just have to hope my
kids never search these archived postings)

&gt;&gt;Does any one have any suggestions as to wich route to take in
&gt;&gt;their experience?
&gt;&gt;The 914 rebuild(2.0) or 1700 stock?
&gt;
&gt;I say have the 914 2.0 (if that's really what's in there) rebuilt.  The 914
&gt;2.0 pistons have a different shaped top on them to achieve higher
&gt;compression and produce more horsepower.  They're also a bit more expensive
&gt;to replace ($500/set).  The valves in the heads are also more expensive
than
&gt;their VW counterparts so if you need head work done, it may cost a little
&gt;more.  But the power difference is substantial and you WILL notice a
smaller
