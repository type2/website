&gt; However, on really windy days with gusts over 30 mph, the bus is still a

&gt; wind handling?  How difficult is the installation of each?

generally the best high wind part is the 4 way flasher.  turn it on, slow
down, turn knuckles white!

seriously what worked best for me was to go to a lower profile wider tire.

I am using Michelin MXT 205x70R14  work great don't hit anything.
also putting my canoe on the roof helped too, but non stock part!
