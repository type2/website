&gt; I scrounged through the wrecking yard today and couldn't find a self

&gt; Type2's have the seatbelt mount horizontally on the flat behind the seat.
&gt; The bug and vanagon mounts are on the side or vertical. The retractors will
&gt; not pull out when laid flat as they are designed to stop when not vertical.
&gt; Can I make 90 deg. adapters to mount the vanagon belts which ARE long
&gt; enough? This way I could use them in my Type2. Does anyone know of some
&gt; belts that are DIRECT BOLT INS??, so I don't have to make these adapters?

I used bug mounts.  You have to unbolt the inertia reel from the mount,
remove the locating pin with vice grips, and reinstall the intertia reel
on the mount with the reel rotated 90 degrees from the original position.
Now bolt the mounts onto your bus.  The reel will be inboard of the bolt,
so the belt will pass behind the rear-seat air duct (if present) on its
way to the shoulder harness loop.

The reels will now work fine, the belt clears the air duct, etc.

The bug latches are riveted together with the floor strap.  Drill out the
rivet and you have two separate buckles that can be bolted to the inboard
seat belt mount on the seats.  They are a bit low and aft, but are quite
usable unless you are a person of girth.

Audi belts are identical to VW belts, so you can get a set of belts out of
a considerably newer car than a bug.  You can even get them in colors if
you have a well-equipped wrecker!
