Hello. I have been having a problem with my bus that neither I, nor my
friends, nor 4 auto shops have been able to pinpoint. I have, among other
buses, a '78 with the 2000cc motor and manual transmission. The problem
that I have been experiencing is, on occasion, the bus shuts down as I'm
driving. It has happened on the expressway at 60 mph, but it is usually
when I'm in second gear. When my speed reaches 27 mph the motor kills. I
keep my foot on the gas and the motor starts back up at 13 mph. I've
checked the grounds and replaced all tune up items. Any help would be
appreciated. Thanks, Billy Knudson (Der Busbesitzer Gruppe), Oshkosh, WI
