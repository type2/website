Dear Chris.

There probably are some interesting British VW Type 2 websites, but I find 
it hard enough to keep up with deluge of e-mail traffic from type2_dot_com.

Regards.

&gt;
&gt;Are there any good British e-mail lists similar to the Type2_dot_com list?
&gt;
&gt;(Good story - very interesting.)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In Great Britain, a 2.0 L Type 4 engine was fitted by Arthur Baraclough
&gt;&gt;into his 1970 VW Type 2. I believe he used the standard crankshaft driven
&gt;&gt;fan, but did have to modify the engine bay surround. This van travelled
&gt;&gt;about 250,000 miles through several deserts, over mountain ranges and is
&gt;&gt;now reputed to be in the Peter Black Museum, in Yorkshire.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;His van has many inovative features (including exhaust-heated, domestic
&gt;&gt;hot water system, double glazed windows and engine starting handle), all
&gt;&gt;of which Arthur fitted himself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sadly, he died in mid-1996, at the age of about 83, having driven his van
&gt;&gt;almost upto the time of his death. I corresponded with him briefly, during
&gt;&gt;late 1995 and early 1996, shortly after I joined the British VW Type 2
&gt;&gt;Owners Club, which currently has about 2,500 fully paid up members.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Regards.
