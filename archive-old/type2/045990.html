 bus! Save the bus!&quot; &gt;&gt;
    
    Well this has been a morning of mixed emotions. My intent had been to get 
the 69 a runner in time for Jerome. But as the sages say 'life gets in the 
way' so here I am having missed Jerome (without a bus whets the point) and 
there are no buses to be found on the property. The real estate agent loves 
it but whets he know. Well being forced into mid-life changes I can take 
solace in knowing that the 70 westy has made it to Alaska from SoCal and the 
new owners loved their bus. I was able to prod Nikki by telling her the bus 
was on the trailer and did she want it to go west to her house or north to 
pickapart, she responded with a she'll be there early to help (2pm ahem some 
peoples kids) and she was forced to pinkie swear to my son that she'd restore 
it. I must be the only one whose convinced that early bays are disappearing 
and should not go to the junkyard least we see a repeat of what happened to 
split windows.

    So no bus progress, just a summer spent prepping the house for sale and 
easing into single live again. But beware once this white elephant is sold 
I'll have the bucks to buy a bus and maybe pay real money for once. As aside 
for you subjected to the 'Elko' chronicles, I tell you that while you 
probably wouldn't take her home to Mom, she at least has decent table 
manners, geez not only did I have to deliver her bus I had to feed her too.
