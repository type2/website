Subject: Re: [T2] Circle Yer Wagens, Sevierville, TN May 6-7

I will be leaving with Ole Putt and &quot;baby&quot; trailer in tow from Southern
Calif to attend CYW tomorrow morning.  The last one I attended was in May
'99 and had a very good time., met a lot of list people (both Type 2 &amp;
Vanagon).

Thanks (sarcastically) are extended to the oil companies to substantially
increasing the fuel costs for this cross country trip.  But it's been
7years, 2 heart attacks, 2 angioplasties and a 4-way open heart bypass since
I had a *real* vacation AWAY from California, so it will be worth it.

Extended weather_dot_com forcast shows Friday (the 5th) and Saturday (the 6th)
to be a bit wet there in Sevierville, but I won't let that be a damper on it
(pun is intended).

So I'm packed and ready to go.  See any and all there.

&gt; So, who all is on the roster to go to this one?  It's always been a fun
&gt; show in the past, and now that I am back in the area I wouldn't miss it for
&gt; the world.  I will hopefully be bringing some of the Knoxville contingent
&gt; with me, if I can round anyone up.  This is assuming I actually decide to
&gt; return from camping (going to Cloudland Canyon today) and re-enter the real
&gt; world.
&gt; I will be there, although I still am not sure whether I'm driving the '69
&gt; or the '84 up there.
&gt; So look for the guy in the VW shirt driving the VW.  That shouldn't be too
&gt; hard. ;)
