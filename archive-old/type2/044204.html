Subject: [T2] Flea market finds

    Went to the local Flea market this morning and found a couple neat
pieces of literature.

    One was the 1964 Clymer's manual &quot;Volkswagen transporter Owners
Handbook&quot; 3rd edition includes 1500 engine.  $5... condition: Good.
Cover is a bit dirty and it is well thumbed thru...

Next;  an 11 page booklet &quot; South Wind heater Installation Instructions
for Volkswagen Transporter Series&quot;.  Handwritten notes throughout,
condition: fair-good...  $3

The last item is incomplete just the cover and color plate of engine
cutaway of an early Volkswagen Transporter owner's manual...  Because
the vendor couldn't find the rest of the pages he just gave it to me...
condition is actually pretty good considering...

Clymer's will not be for sale.  The Southwind install guide will be
available for copies...
