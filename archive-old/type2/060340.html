&lt;&lt; P.S.  What provoked me to post this tonight was that JCwhipme, uh, I mean
JC
 Whitney is selling these right now for $6.99.  Foolish to not get two pairs
 and carry a spare for the stranded VW motorist you encounter on the side of
 the road.  They come in Blue / Red / Yellow or Orange.  Sorry, no black :)

Two sets??  That's why I buy the Bosch for 12 bucks a set...lifetime
warranty!!  I only have to buy them once, though I do keep one spare plug wire
in my all of VW's.  Had a wire come loose once and hit the fan belt (extreme
bus driving).  Bosch considers this abuse.  But if a wire just plain quits
working, I just take them in and get a new set!
   Peace, Love, and if Bosch is good enough for VW, it's good enough for me!
