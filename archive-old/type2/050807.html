&gt; Funny you should say this. Since our mains voltage is 230 Volts already
&gt; (Europe) people here claim you really need a 380 Volts unit to do
&gt; professional work.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the difference is not so much the voltage (although it is true
&gt; what you write about currents etc) but the fact that 380 (or 220 in your
&gt; case) is a 3-phase supply which gives a smoother DC current for welding.

We have 220V single phase and 220V three-phase, and if you're in a
residential area you can't get three-phase per the National Electric Code.
Also, serious industrial electric service here is 440v three-phase. I've got
a printing press that draws 100 amps of that.

The difference is that 220v wiring is usually set up to carry more amperage.
The 110v outlets in my house are wired for 15 amp service; the 220v outlet
that runs my kitchen range has a 50 amp breaker on it. Same deal with Euro
power, but substitute 220v for 110v and 380v for 220v.

Now, if you want real nice welds and all you've got is 110v (which for sheet
metal work is all you need--hell, your average Itty Bitty MIG, like a
Lincoln Weld-Pak 100 or an Esab Migmaster, only puts out eighteen volts at
max 80 amps anyway) get a tank of one-third argon, one-third carbon dioxide
and one-third helium and hook that to your regulator. It's called trimix and
any welding supply will either have it in stock or will be able to brew you
up a tank with no problems at all. If you're extremely flush with cash, have
them put in maybe five percent neon.
