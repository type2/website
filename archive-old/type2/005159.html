Open your engine lid. Look up. You should see a tube coming from each corner
and connect to a rubber tee in the middle, by the blower fan. These are the
tubes that go up into each rear corner. Part of the vent system. The 3rd leg
of that tee goes to the right end of the cannister.
The large hose on the right end goes to the EEC purge valve on the back of
the air cleaner housing. The large hose on the left end goes to the end of
the fan housing.

&gt; Hello listee's,
&gt; WARNING _ NOVICE AHEAD!
&gt; anyway, i went through all the manuals I could, and just looked for places
&gt; where it might go, but I am at a loss.
&gt; I have a 76 westfalia. When you have the engine lid open, (the top one,
&gt; looking down from inside) the top right of the canister has this smaller
&gt; hose coming out of it, and mine is hooked up to nothing.
&gt; It looks like it was fitted over a little T connector probably, but I
cannot
&gt; find anyplace where it would be missing from.
&gt; I checked the haynes manual, and I cannot seem to find any diagrams (or
any
&gt; I understand I suppose) showing where this would hook up to.
&gt; any advise would be super duper.
