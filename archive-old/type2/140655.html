Subject: Engine Drops and Dirty Cylinders

You've got the engine out.
By all means I'd pull the other head, inspect the rings and cylinders.
I'd inspect the rod bearings and install a new set of any copper base shows
or the rods have lateral slop.
You should hone the cylinders and install new rings.
As far as the color of wet pistons and heads I'd just suggest that you
ignore that since the engine could be running rich or the car could be
sucking oil in through the crankcase vent.
Since you've got the heads off you should hand lap the valves as insurance
against leaks.
Low compression can cause the engine to look wet since it gets incomplete
combustion and you don't get enough heat to burn off the extra blow by oil.

We didn't pull the other head off to see if the same issue was happening
there. Troy said he hadn't noticed any smoking or oil consumption before
parking the bus to redo the exhaust.

What do ya'll think?
