Subject: Hot Wheels (brake job)

I just finished replacing the rear brakes on my '74 camper. New shoes 
and wheel cylinders, replaced the lines on one side. I adjusted the 
brakes as per Muir, turned the stars until the wheels were tight then 
backed off until they turned freely. There was some scraping as I 
turned but no binding--again, as per Muir. I used a MityVac and bled 
from both wheels. Then I adjusted the emergency brakes, trying to make 
both sides as even as possible.

I did some short test drives--seemed OK. But after the drive to work 
(about 20 minutes) the left wheel was pretty hot. Not 
hot-enough-to-fry-spit hot, but hotter than seems normal and far hotter 
than the right rear wheel. Before driving home I crawled under the bus 
and loosened the stars about one full turn. Maybe not quite as hot by 
the time I got home, but still pretty hot.

So I took off the wheel and found that the brake drum was difficult to 
turn by hand. (Had I turned the stars the wrong way? I don't think so.) 
I backed off the stars about three turns and the wheel turned freely. 
But after a 10 minute drive, the wheel is still hot.

I dunno...maybe the e-brake isn't fully releasing after it is applied? 
I assume that I need to tear that wheel apart and start over.

Are there certain things that I should be looking for in particular as 
I trouble-shoot? Is it possible that the (brand new) brake shoes need 
to be replaced after this much friction? If so, how can I tell?

Thanks
