&gt;Tonight I replaced the hoses that go from the fan shroud to the Heat

This is the reason I had to dent the flexible exhaust tubing to get around 
tubes
on the exhaust collector--it isn't quite THAT flexible.  I marked the tubing
with a felt pen, where I needed the dent.  I heated up that area with an 
oxy-acetylene
torch, laid on a piece of galvanized plumbing pipe of about the same size as
the collector tube, and smacked it with a big hammer, until it was sufficiently
dented.  Easy.

&gt;I'm no genius, but that's a bit too much
&gt;heat for that coated cardboard tubing stuff to handle.

In this instance, you're as big of a genius as the VW engineers, 'cuz they 
didn't
do it that way either, even though it would have saved a bunch of bucks.

&gt;So what would be the best way to prevent this??
&gt;Fabricate some sort of metal tube that is down near
&gt;the exhaust and comes up through the tin, then hook my hose to that? Someone
&gt;mentioned that this is how the stock setup works.

Well, no.  That's not how the stock setup works, it's what I had to do (for 
my non-stock
collector exhaust) to get things to work sorta' like the stock setup.  Look 
at page 12 of
Engine and Clutch, in the green Bentley.  Compare this with what you've got 
on your
collector exhaust system.
