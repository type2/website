Subject: I can't believe this!

Okay, I pulled the engine out of my '81 Vanagon, which was blowing
oil. Put in new front and rear oil seals, plus, just for good measure,
since the oil seemed to be getting blown all over the engine, the oil
cooler and seals. Then installe it in my '73 bus, not that that makes
much diffence. Finally got it running right, even idles.
   So, guess what? After about 5 miles, I see some leakage, looking like
from the rear seal. Then, after about 20 miles, oil is blowing all over
the engine again. Even worse than before -- like a quart in 15 miles!
It's impossible to see where it's coming from, since the whole engine is
covered with oil, top to bottom. Before it got bad, I looked at the
valve covers, they looked okay. Pushrod tubes could not possible get
into the engine airstream this way -- at least I wouldn't think so.
Where else???
