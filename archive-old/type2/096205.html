Subject: Re: [T2] Side tent 4 Bus

&gt; My lovely wife has decided that if we are going to be camping with the entire
&gt; family, then we need to get a side tent for the rug rats. I saw BusDepot
&gt; advertise one for $199 in VW Trends and got VERY excited. However when I
&gt; called them tonight they said that they would not have them available for
&gt; another 2-3 weeks, but we need one by High Country Bus Festival. So, does
&gt; anyone know of a supplier where I can get a decent New side tent for my bus,
&gt; preferably for under $250? Doesn't need to be fancy, just useful.

personally I had a side tent on my 65 and I found that I prefer a regular
tent set up facing the side of the bus with a tarp over the bus and front
of the tent.  can drive away and not have to perfectly line up to the side
tent when you get back, also since my kids are older I and I think they
preferred the distance
