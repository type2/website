I hate pilot bearings!!!!!  This is an awful way to remove it, but it
worked for me.  Since you have already broken off the front of it, go ahead
and pry out all of the needle bearings and the carrier, until you only have
the outer casing left stuck in the crankshaft.  Wipe it clean of grease and
dirt.  Now take a bare hacksaw blade, one with a fine tooth for cutting
metal.  Keeping the blade as straight as you can, insert the end into the
crankshaft (DOWN Steve!!!) and *carefully* cut through the outer casing.
Clamp a vise grip on the blade if you need a better way to hold it.  Do a
little at a time - periodically take a screwdriver and hammer and try to
move the shell.  When you get close to cutting all the way through, the
shell will become weak and when you hit it with the hammer/screwdriver it
will collapse a bit and get loose enough that you can pry it out.  BE
CAREFUL not to cut too far (i.e. into the crankshaft).  If you damage the
crank to where the new bearing will not sit tightly, you will have REAL
trouble!  This is a slow, difficult way of removing the bearing, but it's
guaranteed to work.  Use it as a last resort.
