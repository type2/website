Hi Seann,

Here's an example from EveryBus 2004:

Rat = Performance enhancements rather than aesthetic enhancements.

There was a 73 bay panel in comparable condition I saw online last year 
that had a Porsche driveline and suspension installed... Would have 
been a nice toy to blow off the local rice-burners some Friday 
evening...


Happy trails,

&gt; What in blue blazes is a 'rat'?  what could a banged up panel and this 
&gt; hot
&gt; rod have in common?  is this a general term for a modified vehicle?
