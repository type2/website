I tend to believe that VW valve cover gaskets should pretty well seat and
set themselves well enough to not need anything extra for adhesion.
Also, a spare set of gaskets should pretty much always be kept in the bus,
just like extra oil, dizzy, points, plugs, belt. 
In a bus, there is usually one battery. 
Over on the other side of the engine is a great area to place another
battery box, but filled with spares items such as those just mentioned.
