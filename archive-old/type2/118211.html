Subject: Re: [T2] GL4, GL5 a new twist

Interesting. I was considering swapping out to straight 50w for the 
motor this summer to see how temps would run. I have not done a 
visual check of 50w oils available locally but if they are as thick 
and chewy as the Stalube 85/90 GL4 is use in my tranny then I might 
be in for a rethink. Perhaps the men of science on the list can shed 
more light on the issue.

Thanks
Chris

&gt;transmissions oil.....
