	&gt; Somewhere I heard that a brake booster could be added to pre-71
Busses as an
	&gt; option.  I don't want to switch my '70 over to disc brakes but
would like to
	&gt; need a bit less leg to stop it.  Anyone ever done this conversion?
I also
	&gt; heard that there is an electrical part I can wire in so I don't
need to run
	&gt; the booster hose all the way back to the engine.  True?  What
parts would I
	&gt; need to come up with for this to work?

	Electrical part? A vacuum pump is what you'd need. I don't know
where you'd
	get one.

I'm sure that's what my friend was talking about.  Anyone ever used a vacuum
pump to replace the standard hose to the back of the Bus setup?
