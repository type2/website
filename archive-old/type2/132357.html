Subject: Re: [T2] Exhaust Nuts

I purchased some through the local VW service garage (whince!!)  I know a
little more spendy however the right item and good conversation as well
since the parts person was a bus owner himself.



 and I'm reluctant to pay shipping on such a
&gt; small item. Is this a Homer De Pot or Blowe's item, or is this a FLAPS
&gt; item? If I can get them locally, what are the size &amp; pitch I should look
&gt; for?
