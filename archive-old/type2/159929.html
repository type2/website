&gt; Would somebody please explain to me why the Corvair conversions?   I'm at a

&gt;    HP is anywhere from 80 to 180 on the Corvair engine (more if you're a
close
personal friend of John Fitch...;-)
   Both engines are air cooled...A big factor...
   Nader's objections were to the early Corvair's swing axles, not the
engine,
but the early VW's and Porsches had them too... ;-(
