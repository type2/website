Subject: Re: [T2] '70 bus drum brakes, pulls to right, plainly just dont
  work  right.

First step: Buy all 4 brake flex hoses. Yours are plugged internally, beyond
a shadow of doubt. This is even though they look fine externally. Replace
them.
You should buy 4 front and 2 rear wheel cylinders.
Front and rear brake shoes.
Front and rear brake hardware kits.
A can or 2 of Brakleen or similar.
2 front wheel bearing seals.
46mm socket and 3/4&quot; breaker bar-best bet is the $45 set of 3/4&quot; metric
sockets from Harbour Freight-this is to remove the rear drums.
2 correct cotter pins for the rear nuts.
A Bentley manual for your bus.
Adjuster stars if any are seized or teeth broken.

Drums, if any are cracked, damaged, or worn beyond use.

That's your minimum parts list. Do it right the first time, or do it again
and again and again and then do it right the fourth time. Ask me how I know.

ok guys,
my brakes suck, i have done nothing to them but bleed
them, that got them to work. before i start driving
this around alot i want my brakes to be all they can
be, the only prob. is i've done anything with vw brake
shoes in the past.

I know its simple to adjust, but are there things that
should be replaced like spring etc at this age?
Im concerned that it pulls to right, but more
concerned about stopping.

thanx,
rob
