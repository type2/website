Subject: Re: [T2] oil pressure

[...]
that should be about normal. as the oil heats up the pressure at a 
given rpm will be lower.
  At 2500 rpm your pressure looks okay for hot oil.

&gt; I have just run my bus for the first time and despite a carburetor

&gt; and the inability to idle there is one thing which bothers me.  I am 
&gt; running
&gt; an 1800 engine with 20w 50 castrol oil and the oil pressure at startup 
&gt; was 50
&gt; psi.  Once the engine was up to temperature and 15 minutes into the 
&gt; run the
&gt; oil slowly dropped down to 20 psi where it stabilized. The longer the 
&gt; engine
&gt; ran, the lower the pressure steadily dropped.  This seems way low to 
&gt; me but I
&gt; don't know what others have experienced with oil pressure.  By the 
&gt; way, the
&gt; engine rpm was about 2500 rpm the whole time (necessary to &quot;work 
&gt; harden&quot; the
&gt; new camshaft according to the cam manufacturer).
&gt; Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!
