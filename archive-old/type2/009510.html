Eric,
What happened is some well meaning but bumbling soul (like myself) either
replaced or otherwise repaired (term used loosely) the wiper system.
They took it all apart, somehow rotated the motor a few turns and then put it
back together.  What they (I) did not take into account is the position of the
motor's shaft in relation to the position of the wiper arm assembly.  When i
did this to my 75 (i switched the motor out to one from a 78), the wipers were
at full rest in the middle of the windshield.  When i turned them on they
would work normally, but when i turned them off, they would come to rest in
the middle of the windshield.  Sure makes you feel like an idiot, but makes
for good 'look-at-the-stupid-thing-i-did' stories. ;]
Only way to resolve it is to get in there and run the wiper motor. when you
turn it off, it should come to rest in the proper position. Then, you can mate
it up to the at-rest wiper assembly. I haven't doen this yet, but i would
think it should work.  Have fun!

&gt; 
&gt; BTW, if anybody has done one of these nose jobs, I'd love to hear how
&gt; you did it.  I have a clip from another late bay that was cut across the
&gt; roof behind the door pillars, and beneath the big seam just above the
&gt; front bumper.
