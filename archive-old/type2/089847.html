&gt; I've heard that the oil filler is different on the 914/412 engine, but 
&gt; unless its a 2 liter 914 engine with the 3 stud intake heads, its almost 
&gt; identical to a bus engine of the same year.
&gt; 
&gt; Your flat spot may be due to the vacuum advance canister on the distributor 
&gt; not working correctly or if the carbs have been rebuilt, its possible the 
&gt; floats weren't adjusted correctly.

Yes the oil filler and dip stick are different and have been swapped. The 
vacuum advance seem to work ok ( if  I suck on the vacuum pipe I can see the 
spark advance with a timing light. Mel
