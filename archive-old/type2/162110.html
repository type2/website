Subject: Re: [T2] Liquid cooled heads?!?!?

Hi Don,

Wow... that looks awesome. But adapting that design to a bus is gonna  
be a very tricky bit of engineering.

  - Relocate water pump from crank to pulley.
  - Design exhaust system to use new exhaust ports on end of heads.
  - Find a location for the dual radiators.

But if the engine and accessory kit are gonna set you back $7K you  
might as well stay aircooled and build  a 100HP porsche or Raby motor  
or instead. It'll save a LOT of time on adapting things and using  
&quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; single-source parts.

Happy Trails,

Greg Potts
