Subject: Re: [T2] vanco-8 tires

The problem you will have with getting these tires soon, is the 120 day 
national back order on the tire.  I planned on buy a set of Vanco-8's 
last week, but my Continental dealer could not find any.  He finally 
called his Continental rep and got the bad news.  These tires are only 
made in Germany.  The only Vanco's left in the country will be on store 
shelves.  His warehouse could not locate a set of these tires in their 
service area...Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa.

Good luck finding a set,
mjr

&gt; Thanks for all the help. I am going to get these tires soon,
