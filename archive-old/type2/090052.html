Subject: Re: [T2] Are these new or restored?

&gt; I would say they are brazilian. I think that the last
&gt; of the mexican busses were watercooled weren't they?

I dont know about that. The mexican busses have been watercooled for a
while but the brazilian busses have a different mixed up body style.
Maybe they are mexican busses built for export.
