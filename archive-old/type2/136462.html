Subject: assist with bug seats

Although this is not strictly a bus issue, I know how helpful the aircooled community is and I wanted give this a shot. And even though I am presently bus-less, I still consider myself part of the lunatic bus fringe.
 
A man in Reno has some stock seats for my 74 standard beetle that he will give me if I can get them from there to NC. Is anyone traveling to the North Carolina from the West Coast that would consider picking them up for me? I'll be glad to help with your gas or whatever. Thanks to anyone who would consider helping. You can contact me at vwbaybus_at_yahoo_dot_com .
 
Clark
