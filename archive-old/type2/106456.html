&gt; Does anyone actually know if there is a source for aftermarket wheels

Try this one:

http://www.centerlinewheels_dot_com/index.html

they can make up just about anything if you have the $$$!

Or try your local kewl wheels outlet.  I'm sure that they can match
something up for you.

Certain Mercedes wheels fit buses as well.
