I decided to clean all the waxoyl and dirt from the underside of my bus (79
2l Viking) and paint it with Hammerite, unfortunately I have discovered
several horrors, previously hidden even to the MOT.

I need to replace both front jacking points and also one of the front
outriggers to start with.  I am a novice to welding but have a MIG and an
angle grinder and need to do this myself.

Is it possible to replace a jacking point without replacing the outrigger?

Has anyone got any tips for these procedures, I have got new outriggers and
jacking points, but it does look a little daunting at the moment.

I would be gratefull for any help or suggestions.
