Subject: Engine pull in Portland
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.02A.9902180553550.26633-100000_at_user1.teleport_dot_com&gt;


So, weather permitting, I'm gonna pull my engine, during the day on
Friday. This will be the first time I've tried this, and I am, frankly,
quite nervous about the whole thing. Anyone in the Portland area want to
come by and give me a hand? I live in Aloha, just off TV Highway.
