Subject: Re: [T2] Injector seals was Re: [Intake manifold
  gaskets/reality]

&gt;I used injector seals from Bus-Boys for my injectors. I was disappointed 
&gt;with the quality as one of the seals had a small tear in the rear. Does 
&gt;not effect the seal but this should not happen. Used it as I had no other 
&gt;choice.
&gt;
&gt;Autozone wants $8 to order a set. I have also thought of getting them from 
&gt;California Imports or Bus Depot but I am not sure if the quality would be 
&gt;any better. For the good quality seals did you order them from a good 
&gt;foreign car parts store or VW?

I got a set from Advance Auto once upon at time. Don't remember the brand 
but they are still doing a good job 5 years later.

These days I don't do much shopping there though. Used to work there.
