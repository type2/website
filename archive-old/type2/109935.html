&lt;&lt; Perhaps if we can get enough people together, we could &quot;borrow&quot; a few 
parts 
from the parts bins, bring them back to the U.S., and assemble our own Brand 
New Type2_dot_com Bus!  Small stuff could be pretty easy; I'm just having

How hard could it be...Johnny Cash did it with a Cadillac, one piece at a 
time...;-)
