Shane:

I recently wrestled with a squeal when I replaced the brake discs and pads 
on my '76 Campmobile.  After dismantling the front brakes three times I 
finally  installed some aftermarket brake shims (and a second set of new 
pads).

The shims I used were Beck Arnley part No. 084-1122 and should cost you 
around $3-$5 at your local parts store.  Please note that these are not VW 
shims (which retail for around $7-$11 each (saving you up to about $35) but 
will will work quite well.  They are simply a heavy fiber material with a 
sticky back.  They fit exactly on the back of the disc pads on my bus.

Good luck.  Let me know if you have any other questions on these items.

Best regards,
