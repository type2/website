Subject: Re: [T2] How much material for Westy curtains?

Careful measurements of the 68 bus offered up a sum of 12 yards. The 
68 does not have a blind spot cabinet so you can take a yard out for 
that.


Happy sewing.

&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Norman, our 72 Westy is in storage for about another two weeks..Still
&gt;waiting for the last of the snow to go up here in Ottawa, Ontario.  In
&gt;the meantime, I thought I would treat him to some new curtains.  Anybody
&gt;know how much material I would need to cover all windows using the old
&gt;cutains as a template?
&gt;
&gt;Much appreciated.
&gt;
