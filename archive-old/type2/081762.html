Subject: Re: [T2] carb air filter question

Mike,

I have the same filter and so far, the only place I have found them is on
the net at  &quot;Donsco&quot;. They're a VW parts house in Cal. Good folks and a lot
of parts, decent prices. I typically buy from &quot;list&quot; vendors first but
sometimes you gotta go somewhere else. Do a web search and I'm sure you'll
find them.

Dave

&gt; Michael,
&gt;
&gt; Or, I am sure that they would be happy to sell you a new complete
&gt; after-market chrome air cleaner that takes  *round* filters.
&gt;
&gt; Available in the &quot;hot rod&quot; aftermarket section of most flaps...
&gt; Make sure round will work for you and then buy the diameter and height
&gt; that fits well.....buy them by &quot;neck&quot; size or take your old air cleaner in
&gt; and match it.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, dave

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just getting the bus ready to run and I am having a hard time finding a
replacement air filter for the Holley/weber progressive carb that is on my
2.0.  The filter unit sits right on top of the carb between two chrome
plates (one on top and one on the bottom).  It is about 5x8 inches rectangle
with a paper/metal mesh in a rubber housing.  I took the old filter to FLAPS
and they looked at me as if I was smoking something.  Maybe I was, but you
have to be able to get replacements somewhere.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
