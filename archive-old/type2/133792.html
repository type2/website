Subject: Re: [T2] FI Update... Again. Very close now, but not quite
  there yet.

&gt; &gt;&quot;The fuel tank now has a splitter that will accommodate the fuel return 
&gt;line.&quot;

&gt;This may be the reason for high fuel pressure. If it is a tee type 
&gt;situation
&gt;with only one branch into the tank, it can't work as a return line, as the
&gt;fuel will be trying to flow in both directions at once.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fluid Hydraulics 101 .... Fluid flows to the point of least amount of 
pressure. I am not stating that the above statement is false. There are 
certain dynamics that would apply to the head pressure at the Tee/Splitter, 
but they would be so miniscule that I will not bother. This type of 
connection should work fine. But I have never run a fuel pump through a 
regulator in &quot;series&quot; to another pump to see the end result, meaning that it 
is basically pumping to itself. Can a pump increase it's own pressure? Would 
it increase the pressure to the pump the second time around? Seems very 
remotely possible, not likely.  So this being said and that &quot;series&quot; would 
be a stand alone deal. If everything is connected and the fuel ring is 
losing the slightest amount of pressure through the injectors and plenty 
more back at the Tee/Splitter. It should work.
