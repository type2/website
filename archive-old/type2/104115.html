Subject: RE: [T2] Fw: Spark Plug

  Speaking of plugs, I just had a customer come to me with his new Mexican
engine running bad. He had it tuned up at another shop, they had installed
Bosch w8ac (short reach). I put new plugs in NGK B5ES didn't touch anything
else and it ran like a champ. Personally I do not like the extended
electrode plugs, they seem to foul easier and/or faster then standerd reach.

Yes!  You need long reach plugs to ignite the mixture properly.  A short
reach plug will be shrouded by the long hole!

Mexican
engines come with (IIRC) BP5ES-A plugs.  I've never been able to find the
&quot;-A&quot; plugs, but regular BP5ES plugs work fine.  In NGK numbering the B is
the thread diameter, The P means projected electrodes (they stick out a
bit further), the 5 is the heat range (smaller numbers are hotter), the E
means long reach (short reach is H) and the s means it's a standard plug
(V is small electrode).

I've found that NGK plugs are of more consistent quality than even Bosch.
Since VW heads are aluminum that is important.

A lot of VW suppliers are unaware of the long reach heads now coming from
Mexico and Brazil.  It's up to the people who own those engines to specify
the correct parts.  If you sell a bus so equipped, be sure to tell the new
owner of the difference!
