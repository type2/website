Subject: Re: Adventurewagon

&gt;I'm thinking that
&gt;a more formal registry of these rare beasts might be in order.

You're on! :-) I've been so slack in updating the current registry since I
quit my job with the rad machine and fast hookup. I was hoping to get back
on it once I get my new Mac -- the one I've got now is a dinosaur. I can't
even run Javascript to view your web page. :-(

&gt;I know
&gt;quite a bit about the history of the company from a friend of mine that
&gt;has been up to the headquarters in Ft. Bragg, CA to have some work
&gt;done.  He tells me that they are still being made on, but on a Ford
&gt;because the Eurovan is too small to fit everything into.

This is good news. All I could find on the internet as re: history of AW
was that after the Vanagon was discontinued, they converted Fords, as you
say. I had heard the shop had closed when the owner retired a few years ago.
