(Reguarding Sears Allstate engines)
&gt;Does this mean that the crank has been turned 30-30? 
YES.  (I'm using caps to set off my answers.)
 Think any of this
&gt;means that it has been align bored?  
YES.  All Sears Allstate engines were line bored.

Any ideas as to what the cylinder size
&gt;of 020 means - surely they didn't bore and reuse the cylinders, did they?
YES.  020 means 20 Thou oversize.
&gt;
&gt;At the bottom of the tag in fine print it says &quot;Specially Made for Sears
Roebuck and Co. by V.E.G.E. Motoren Spijkenisse (Holland).  I wonder if
that means the tag, or if they did the rebuild.
THEY DID THE REBUILD.  Sears contracted with various rebuilders for their
various engines - US engines in the U.S., European in Europe.

Anyway, maybe useless information.  Might make a neat addition to the
&gt;rebuilt engine though.  Sears engines were quite common I think.
QUITE common.  And usually well done.  They carried a 30,000 mile warranty,
which is more than most rebuilders will give now.
