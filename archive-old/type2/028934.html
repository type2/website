Hi George et al,

Just a note to say that the fact that your red light doesn't go out at idle
but does when you blip the throttle is nothing to worry about.
Its simply that the cut in speed for your alternator to start charging is
higher than your idle speed!
My bus does it sometimes too.

Good luck

I finally completed my slow job of converting the '71 from generator to
alternator.  Here's some notes on the process.

....

Hooked up the battery.  Turned the key to &quot;on&quot;.  Alt and oil lights on.
Good!  Fired up the engine.  Oh-oh, alt light still on.  Blip the
throttle, light goes out.  Repeat.  Same thing.  Perhaps my idle speed is
too low or I have a bad connection in the alt light wiring.  In any case,
battery voltage is 13.7V, so the alternator is doing the job!

....

That's it!  Thanks to Chuck Notmeyer for pointing me at parts sources!
