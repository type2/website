&gt; Sounds like a neat idea.  I only have two questions - where does one get dry ice?  And how much does it cost?


I get enough dry ice in cube form, not a block, at a local welding supply shop.
Enough to fill a picnic cooler for free. Well,, for the cost of the coffee's I
take in with me.

The nice thing about dry ice is there is no wet items in the cooler,, the draw
back, everything is frozen to death!

Here is the best system as it was told to me by someone on this list.
Two campers traveling together, each has a cooler to carry
Camper one carries the water ice cooler with the supplies in it.
Camper two carries the Dry ice cooler with a supply of water ice.

Now you can set up camp away from a source of ice for about 4-5 days.

Of course you could carry both coolers in one camper if you have the room.
Just remember, the dry ice is only to keep the water ice from spoiling.
The water ice is for the Beer!... you'll find the beer freezes really fast in
with the dry ice.

Also, the dry ice evaporates as carbon dioxide which might be a problem if you
need more oxygen to breathe
Cheers!
