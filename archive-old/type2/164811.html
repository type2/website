Subject: RE: [T2] 68 only wiper question

Jim,

 

I'll snap some photos of them in the morning. I'll bet the trimming idea
will be the route to take.

 

Interesting trivia on the Fridolin. Now I can say I my '68 is 1/2500th Frid!

 

Thanks!

Jon -

 

If they are the &quot;narrow&quot; Bosch or SWF Blades, the 16&quot; or longer refills from
Bosch (which are rubber only) will work, you just have to trim them down
with a single-edged razor.  With this style, the metal reinforcement strips
in the rubber (on each side) are removeable to re-place into the new rubber
refill.  I have a friend in the biz who now makes a &quot;universal&quot; Bosch style
22&quot; (I think - might be longer,) rubber refill specifically made for
trimming down for the various wiper sizes. 

 

If your blades' reinforcement strips are a &quot;permanent&quot; part of the rubber
refill, they may not be original and require a &quot;Trico&quot; or ANCO replacement
refill.

 

Pmail a decent close-up photo of one end of the blade so I can see the
cross-section of the blade and help determine this.  Other photo views are
welcome to help if I can.

 

Part Number trivia:  68 Only Buses used VW 147 955 425 B Wiper Blade
Assemblies.  This was originally the wiper for the VW Fridolin :-)  For
those who don't know, this blade had a &quot;narrow&quot; attachment locker for narrow
hook arms - the only year Buses used these.  69-79 Buses used a &quot;wide&quot;
locker/hook arm. 

 

But if memory serves, when I use to sell the blade assemblies, these were 16
inches long - at least the replacements were out of Germany.  I use to sell
these like crazy 'cause I was the only one who had them at the time
(80s-90s).

I am running an original set of '68 only wiper arms with a set of pristine
vintage Bosch wiper blades. Now I have a problem, the blades are done for. 
The 15&quot; blades don't have a refill number at my FLAPS. A regular bus 16&quot;
refill blade won't fit and 15&quot; stock refills are not listed. Anyone know a
part number for the refills so I can cross reference a TRIICO or Bosch 
refill?
Thanks,
