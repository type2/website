Subject: Cap Nuts (Oil Plate/Strainer Cover Nuts)

Folks,

I'm having a tough time finding these things for my '70 loaf.  I did
find them at aircooled_dot_net for $2 each, however!  Yikes!  $12 seems kind
of high for six cap nuts.  Anyone out there have a better source for
these nuts?  Oh...and are the oil plate cover studs 21mm long?

In other news, I saw a 67 (I think) double cab 3-door pickup for sale
here in Tacoma, WA.  I just spoke with the guy and he said he'd take $5k
for it.  It's all been gone over mechanically, with &quot;only&quot; the interior
and body to finish up.  It's his primary trasportation, and he says it's
mechanically sound.  The interior doesn't look that bad (better than
mine, but that's not saying a lot), and the body looks ok too.  It would
want paint, but there are no blatant rust problems, just the odd dimple
here and there.

If I'd seen it a week ago, I would have bought it (instead I got the
anthesis of the VW pickup...a Ford F-250 with a 460 V8).  If anyone is
interested, you can send me your info, and I'll try and get it to this
guy.  He lives on a boat, so tracking him down might be a challenge.

Thanks again,
--
