Subject: Re: I agree report &quot;bad apples&quot;

I have to say it was nice to be able to go to the archives and ask the list
about AVP engines a few weeks ago. Time and time again nothing but positive
reports, one bad but all in all very good. I also needed a new muffler,
After reading the archives decided against the EMPI exhaust, WHY? Because so
many people said they where pieces of crap.
I don't think business realizes how much of an impact discussion list like
this will have on their business. If they are a good reliable, honest
business, people will talk about them and recommend them. If they had a bad
experience they will report that and warn others not to make the same
mistake, THIS LIST IS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!

&gt;I have to agree that reporting bad apples is a good idea. List members are
&gt;always supporting one another and maintaining the hobby. Jerks who are not
&gt;honorable when doing business should be reported to the list. They are no
&gt;different than the bastards stealing parts off your bus in the middle of
the
&gt;night. Theives are theives and I think it's best that we identify them for
&gt;one another.
&gt;
&gt;I recently traded some parts with a list member and had a very positive
&gt;experience. (Thanks Dan Evans) We just sent the parts we agreed to send and
&gt;didn't hassle about anything.  It was a nice feeling and I want to be part
&gt;of a group that supports that kind of ethic.
&gt;
&gt;Just my 2 cents.
