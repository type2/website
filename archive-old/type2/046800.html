Subject: [T2] Removing the sliding door handle on a 72 bay

We are trying to replace the lock barrel on the sliding door of our 72 bus 
but are having difficulties in removing the door handle itself. I was hoping it 
would been a simple case of removing the inner door handle and sliding the 
outer door out of the mechanism - obviously no such luck. Has anyone done 
this and got any tips and suggestions etc?
Thanks.
