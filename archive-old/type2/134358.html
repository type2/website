Subject: RE: [T2] Another key question

Sean, are you sure that cylinder is sealed? Usually there is a very
tiny set screw. I thought mine was sealed too until I took it too the
locksmith to get it keyed. Then he scraped some dirt off and showed me
the set screw.
-----------------------------------------------------------
It's sealed in the sense that there is a locking washer that would have to
be pried from the cylinder.  This would destroy this lock washer.  I will
have to locate a suitable replacement washer of this type and dimension
prior to dismantling the cylinder.  I know it could be done,...  it's just
not as convenient as the proverbial screw or drift pin.  I would also still
have the problem of a functional spare key.  This I think I will have to
find locally since I require my bus for day to day commute.  Anyone have a
locksmith in the Portland OR area with old dub keystock?
