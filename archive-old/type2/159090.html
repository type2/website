Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Pressure dropping to Zero after 15 mnutes warm up 
  when I  stop?

&gt;&gt; 15 minutes (Oil temps 200-210) the
&gt;&gt; pressure drops to 0. 
&gt;

My '78 GE code 2.0L does that. Well did that before I stored the engine. 
I think it is because the crank bearing clearances were too large. 
Checked the oil pressure with oil pressure gauge (electric VDO and 
mechanical generic), checked pressure relief valves, and replaced the 
oil pump.

It would keep the oil pressure light off at idle but the rods would 
knock gently at idle.
