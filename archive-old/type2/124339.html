Subject: Re: [T2] Source for cylinder shims

Although not &quot;recommended&quot;, you can &quot;stack 'em up&quot; to get the shim height
you want.  Are you sure about the numbers you used to deduce the .070&quot;
figure?  That implies a might small head volume.  Too, using commonly quoted
figures for deck height and chamber volume, using .060&quot; shims in place of
the .070&quot; shims increases CR only by around .11 - .14.  A CR of 7.11 to 7.15
is still fairly mild.

Subject: [T2] Source for cylinder shims


&gt; I am looking for a source for cylinder base shims (spacers).  These are
&gt; the shims that go between the base of the cylinder and the engine case.
&gt;   Bus Depot lists only thicknesses of .010&quot;, .020&quot;, .030&quot;, .040&quot;, .060&quot;,
&gt; and .090&quot;.  By my calculations, I would need about .070&quot; to get the
&gt; compression ratio that I want (7.0)
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone recommend another source for these shim/spacers?
