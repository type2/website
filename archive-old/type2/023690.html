Well..... The trailer hitch thing did not quite come together at the last 
minute, so thought I would bring the side tent. What the heck, the thing has 
only been up about 15 times in as many years, might as well use it. New 
listee Chris Slaymaker and daughter Emma were to come sans bus due to a &quot;tree 
incident&quot;. It would give them a place to crash. Daughters Alice and Ted came 
this trip.

Weather was beautiful for the event. Camping on the river side. Very nice.

Same crowd as expected, but BIG turnout. When I arrived about 1pm on Saturday 
the place was packed and had to camp on the other side of the &quot;poultry barn&quot; 
(Fair ground site). Nice site -- as was quiet for the kids. Chris picked it 
out before I got there so it had been crowed for a while.

I bought a hitch for $15.00. Right on. Just spent 5 hours last week and twice 
that $$ in materials for one that did not make it. :-)

Saturday night had a nice bonfire with a bluegrass band. We brought 
Marshmallows so all the camping kids took turns roasting over a VERY hot 
fire. Had to sneak them in under the heat! Lots o' fun.

Listees: Ted F. (Ted E Bare), Frank and Kathy, Easterwood, Brennen, Mitch, 
Doug Loyd, Strickland,......more that I do not know or forget at this 
writing. Spent a lot of time with Jim Thompson from Old Volks Home. He needs 
a laptop as will be on the road for a while. :-) He missed Everybus because 
he was not online and was right in that area!!

&quot;Babcia&quot; ran like a champ (passed 6 cars on the way!) but is losing oil. Need 
to figure out where it is coming from. Lost about 1/4 - 1/2 quart in 300 
miles. :-(
