Subject: Fuel filler hose, etc., in my bus
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Well, I needed to use the 75 bus to travel 150 miles
to the Energy Fair in central Wisconsin, and it had
been smelling strongly of gas when the tank was near
full, so I ordered a filler neck elbow for it. Took
the panel out (the firewall?) in front of the engine,
behind the gas tank, with not too much trouble.  I had
to take out the air cleaner and the fuel injection
stuff, but that comes out easily.  Also took out the
injection computer and the round black cover just in
front of it, and with those out of the way, and the
firewall laying on top of the engine, I could see all
the hose, etc.

My biggest problem was that it wasn't the elbow at the
gas filler that leaked, but rather the long curved
rubber hose that goes to the tank.  And of course I
didn't have a spare one of those, and the available
gasoline grade hose that I could find in town is so
stiff that it couldn't be bent to go to the filler
neck on the gas tank.  So I found a steel exhaust
fitting at NAPA that is the right diameter, and
trimmed it to length, and clamped it in place with a
short piece of hose between it and the tank filler,
and a longer piece of hose between it and the steel
part by the filler.  I also replaced all of the short
pieces of fuel line in the fuel venting system, as
they were all hard and cracked inside.  Put everything
together, drove to the gas station, filled it up, and
NO MORE GAS SMELL!!

Had a great time at the energy fair, met some nice bus
people (who never heard of the bus list), and averaged
about 19 to 20 mpg at about 70mph, plus some in town
and in traffic driving.
