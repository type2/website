&lt;&lt;  Is it something cheap and simple to fix like clutch

If you had the clutch cable really tight I would suspect a bad throw out 
bearing to cause the growling and broken t/o bearing retaining clips causing 
the pop bang. I once over tightend mine and got the same symptoms. I think 
over tighting the clutch cable will cause slippage as well. I personally 
would replace the clutch unless its new, and If it has high miles I would 
replace the pressure plate as well. if there was alot of slippage you may 
want to rough up the surface of the fly wheel and pressure plate with some 
sand paper.
hope it helps
