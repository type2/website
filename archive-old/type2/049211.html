Subject: Re: [T2] split Handbrake as pseudo diff-lock for off-road use!!!

Wouldn't that be a limited slip differential?  Would that be a standard
feature on a bus?

Not sure.

The idea is that two additional levers are attached on either side of
the main hand break one, cut off and covered in cycle handles.
The two new outer levers are then attached via a bike chain and a
piece of metal that sits under the adjustment screw to to each
braking cable separately.
If you then pull the handbreake as normal both cables will be tighten
as normal.
If you are stuck and lets say your right wheel is spinning you can
pull the right leaver which will only pull the right braking cable by
the adjustment screw, this slowing down the right wheel and making
the left wheel turn.
Nifty he?
A lot of new cars use the ABS system in a similar way to prevent
slippage, so it should work.

If this is not clear look at the diagram again or even better have a
look at your hand breake setup and you will see how you can
selectively breake one wheel at a time!
