Subject: Overheating my two cents!!
Message-ID: &lt;0.93d92c5c.255defa6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Whoever said heater hoses was absolutely correct. Give that individual a 
cookie. If heater hoses in the engine compartment are missing or broken, air 
is forced into the engine area causing adverse affects.  You will be 
defeating the purpose of forcing air out of the engine area especially warmer 
air.  Just think of the millions of time hours and a few dollars spent to 
research this system, and yet after 50 years only mild alternatives have been 
used to improve or renovate the original, I don't know why.. go ahead and 
think it (smart as) The only exception in all my years has been on bajas in 
that we plug, weld (cheap alternative) or replace with one piece no heater 
port shrouds letting all the air go to the cooler and heads.  Also on the 
underneath a missing or broken hose will push warmer or hotter air (I live in 
the desert) back on to areas that can most efficiently use cold or cooler air 
being pushed under the bus and out.  You want to have top notch heater 
components at all times or take the proper steps to alleviate the ventage. 
now I know this might not be the reason your particular loved one is 
overheating, but in the long run it very well could.
Peace Out
