Subject: 76' westy Pop-top Canvas

I have a canvas off of a 76 Westy it is pretty good shape with very few holes 
one tear maybe 3x7 inches in the upper left corner all fabric is still there 
to sew it back up i am pretty sure of. Other wise someone could get a patch 
to put over it or something. I have not use for it right now so i want it 
gone i am asking 75 for it plus shipping or make me an offer. I don't want 
it. I also have many other parts for sale so e-mail me if you need something. 
Parts are mostly from a 70 westy and a 71' westy plus i have a  black 
interior from a bug for sale. Thanks
