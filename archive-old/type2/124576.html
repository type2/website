Subject: toy engine into vw bus

&gt;Anybody besides RoadCow have a Toyota engine in their bus?
&gt;
&gt; Having a donor car, I'm thinking about cutting the mounts from
the
&gt; Celica's frame instead, but I'd like any info and experience
others
&gt; have...

I say go for the swap.

You will gain many wonderful things

You will get hot water heat. Take a bunch of the toyota inside
cabin heater parts. use these and graft them into the VW air duct.
You will be warm and comfortable. you will not have to have a
buddy drive with you in the winter to scrap ice off the inside of
the windshield. You can block off the original vw engine heat
exchanger openings and gain lots of QUIET.

You will get an engine that will last close to 200,000 miles vs
the iffy 100,000 vw engine.

you will lose many wonderful things ...
