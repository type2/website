Subject: RE: [T2] Alternator cooling boot

If this many have been sold with no issue's, then I'll definitely be
checking my process for applying it.  I have tried several different ways,
of which one was totally attaching it to the alternator while out of the
bus.  I've of course looked at the archives and my Bentley as well.  I'll
follow up in the morning and make sure I'm not missing something.

Thanks for the help...

Troy

We haven't had any problems at all with the VWG repro.
