&gt; I know Melling makes honest-to-goodness type IV pumps with the ears on

&gt; gear would make any difference, since the only part that interfaces
&gt; with the pump is the slot in the side.  It's been a while since I
&gt; looked at it though, so I can't claim absolute knowledge.

wheeeeeh, I was beginning to get paranoid, someone else has actually seen
this Melling pump... I long ago threw out the box and wasn't about to take
the fan housing off to look, especially since it has been working fine for
15k or so miles....   while I could have been mistaken I was pretty
positive I had a Type IV stock melling oil pumpp.....until shown otherwise
I will assume that is what I actually have in there.
