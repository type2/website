The sound you describe may be caused by a loose tin screw being tossed =
around by the squirrel cage fan.

You might be able to patch the hole in the muffler with a little gas =
welding.

'78 is a very desirable year. Type IV engines are considerably more =
expensive to rebuild, but a properly-maintained 2.0 liter should provide =
a lot more power and last a lot longer than a Type I (Beetle) engine. =
Plus, from '78-on, hydraulic lifters were standard - no valve =
adjustments. Add an electronic points/condenser replacement unit, and a =
tuneup consists of merely changing sparkplugs, oil and filters.

&gt; Would that be tent up, or tent down?

LOL.. What a sight that would be! But I'm sure it's been done.
Thanks for the answers, all.
Now I am wondering if I should pinch myself, or knock on wood. Because =
as
near as I can figure, we're getting about 26 MPG, maybe a bit more, on =
the
highway, with the Mexican-built 1600 engine, which runs like it is =
charmed.
It is just about eight months old, as I recall and does a good little =
clip
every day as a daily driver. This is on a '71 T2 &quot;transporter&quot; with no =
extra
equipment. I am wondering that for all the flap about fuel injection, =
that
the late 70's Westy's don't seem to do so well on gas. Sure, they have =
all
the camping gear, but it's not really so much more in weight and wind
resistance, is it?
Today I took a little &quot;test drive&quot; on a '78 Sunroof T2 with a 2L FI =
engine.
This is the one I mentioned the other day for $800 obo. I spotted it in =
a
local neighborhood. That thing sure has a lot of pep and power! Good =
brakes,
too. Unfortuneately, there is an exhaust leak, so it won't smog. I heard =
it
and when I asked about it the guy pointed out a hole in the muffler. You
could feel the exhaust coming through under pressure. There is also a =
slight
sound like a marble rolling around in a coffee can. I think that it =
could be
coming from the squirrel cage area.. probably a fan bearing or =
alternator
bearing. Any idea what sort of trouble that may represent? Other than =
that,
it seems to shift well, revs up real quick (responsive) and has a lot of
power. This seems to be a real good engine. He says it has about 87,000
original miles on it, but who the heck knows (?). Anyway if seeing is
believeing, that bus has quite a bit of life in it yet. I didn't take it =
up
on the freeway because the fuel guage didn't show any gas and I wasn't
interested enough to go put fuel in it. But in first, second and third =
it
showed me what it had and I was actually rather impressed.
The present owner is a construction worker who can turn a wrench. He
replaced the fuel lines to the injectors and a vacuum line, some of =
which
were leaking. The vehicle had been sitting somewhere for awhile =
apparently,
and I think he got it real cheap, just turning it over to make a little
quick money. It wasn't quite dinner time yet and he'd already put away a =
few
beers, I think. Very casual guy. I think he would come down to $650 or =
$700
if he saw cash.

I would be interested in any thoughts on that little marble-y noise. I =
don't
think that this is normal, but then again doesn't sound like anything =
real
serious. Hmmm..   Jan B
