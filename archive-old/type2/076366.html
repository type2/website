Subject: Replaced the clutch cable- WHY is it too long??

The good news- The throwout bearing did not derail, and a too long
clutch cable is better than a too short one!
The bad news- I replaced the cable with a new one I've had in the Westy
a few years -got the cable hooked up in front, got it thru the Bowden
tube, inserted the threaded end through the release, and noticed it
seems an inch too long (IE, when you pull the arm so the throwout
bearing just contacts the pressure plate, most all of the threads were
showing- at first I thought that maybe the throwout bearing had been
derailed when the cable popped, but there was no noise on that long
drive home.......so I added a few 3/8&quot; nuts as shims and got an
adjustment that properly did work the clutch.  The wing nut is wired so
it can't back out.  Shifts fine.
Now, anyone out there know why this cable for a 78 bus was an inch or so
longer- was this for an earlier bus or maybe a later vanagon??
