Subject: winterizing a bus :)

Hey guys

I am about to put my 74' bus away for the winter.
2 questions.. Fill it with gas and put stabilizer in it? or just dont worry
about that.
second.  If I want to charge the battery time to time (It has 2 batteries) can
I
charge the main battery with a charger and at the same time turn the switch
on
so it charges both the accessory battery and the main at the same time?

ie. Manual switch to connect the two batteries while driving.. for charge.
Can I flick the switch while it's parked and hook the charger up to one..
charging
both at the same time?

Thanks!

James
