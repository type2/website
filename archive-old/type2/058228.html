I've often wondered why the jelly doesn't run down the terminals,
interrupt the metal-to-metal junction, and result in increased contact
resistance.    It takes only a fraction of an ohm of resistance to prevent
even a fully charged battery from pumping several hundred amps through the
starter.

&gt; Fifth, you need to provide a protective coating.  I've found that
&gt; petroleum jelly makes and excellent coating.

        Just a quick &quot;Me Three&quot; on the petroleum jelly. I've been doing this
for
        20 years. My dad did it for 50+ years. After you put the terminal
on, smear
        an extra coating over top of the whole clamp. You'll never have a
coroded
        battery cable again. Nor will you ever have startign problems due to
loose, dirty
        coroded cables.
