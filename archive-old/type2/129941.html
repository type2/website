&gt;Fuel pressure = 40psi.

Too high. should be around about 28 lbs. Pressure regulator, verify vacuum 
hose to that and no restriction in the return fuel line to the tank.

&gt;As far as I can tell there are really only 2 other components to test: The 
&gt;double relay and the wiring harness.

If the injectors are injection and the fuel pump is running, the relay is 
doing it's thing.
