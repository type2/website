&gt;Hoe boy....
&gt;hollie...
&gt;repeat after me:
&gt;&quot;I can do anything&quot;.....
&gt;and then believe it....
&gt;Otherwise youse in a *heap* a trouble....

I know I'm crazy, but I do believe I can do anything. Last night I stayed up
late learning the basics of how an engine works. I ASKED my Dad this when I
was little, and my uncle, and my grandpa; they brushed me off. I even asked
boyfriends. Hey, wouldn't you think it was kind of cool to teach your girl
all about cars? I guess I'm the only one that thinks so. More brush off. Now
I get to learn my way. I'm excited to do it. My only bad feelings about the
job are that I have only $200 a month to spend on this little hobby unless I
want to get a job in addition to full time days at school. I expect to get
her running around the end of summer.....with luck. Right now I'm driving
our Jeep.  

&gt;If you don't have one, go get a heavy duty floor jack. like the 2 ton jobs
&gt;from the pacific rim for 69 bucks...you will use it *all* the time...

I got one yesterday. Two to be exact. I also spent about $117 on the Phase
One Tools. Then I set about recharging the battery. (With a recharger
outside of the bus, don't worry, I won't kill the Brain of my FI). The only
glitch is that now I don't know how to get the battery back in. The question
is, re-connect the negative side first or positive? Time to call Ken. I also
bought the Idiot's Guide and the Bentley manual.  

&gt;Can I give you a friendly &quot;What *were* you thinking????&quot;
&gt;A late bus in &quot;iffy&quot; shape is not a car to start learning on..

Yeah, I know, but I knew a few things:

1. I'm going to want a later bus anyway, one with FI. I might as well learn
on one that has it. 
2. This baby was a steal. The rust situation is very good, and it's a '78
westy in good shape. I payed $1000. (Talked down from $1450.) I could sell
off the parts for more than that. Not that I will, I want to make it my car.

3. It felt right. And I always do what my gut says. My gut is ALWAYS right. 
4. I only had $1000 to spend, and I wasn't going to find a '78 westy in this
kind of shape with a nice clean running engine for that much. Some people
who know a lot more might disagree with me on that, but I would have to just
smile and return them to the part about my gut. 

&gt;have a look-see... make a list....and get back to us...

Right now the main tasks are:

1. Get money.

2. Replace muffler and find hose for this obvious place underneath bus I
found yesterday that is obviously missing big chunk of hose. (Find out what
this thing is first.)

3. Get more money.

4. Replace the brake pads. 

5. See #3.

6. Do a tune-up. (Probably have this guy Ken suggests do it. Maybe he'll let
me watch if I pay him more.) 

7. Bus should, theoretically, be running after that.
