Might work.  The Aussies put their radiators underneath, between the fram
rails.

Radiators pack a lot of heat-transfer ability into a small package, since
they are purpose-designed to exhange heat.

I had a friend who was using a water-cooled generator and decided to use
the waste heat for domestic heating.  He eliminated the radiator and
plumbed the cooling loop into two 55-gallon drums of water.  Even with the
small (~15HP) engine and big drums radiating heat it could not get rid of
heat as rapidly as a small radiator could.  He ended up putting the
radiator back into the circuit after the tanks.
