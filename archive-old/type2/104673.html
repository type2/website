Subject: RE: [T2] VW Emblem???

&gt; I'd like to mount a VW emblem (I prefer this over the spare tire). 
&gt; However, I don't necessarily want to have to drill holes
&gt; Is there anywhere that I can get the front Volkswagen emblem for
&gt; my irlfriend's bus and have it affixed using some sort of an 
&gt; adhesive or double sided duct tape?


You could try emblem adhesive, which is available at most auto parts
stores. The stuff I've seen is a gummy, &quot;tarry&quot; sort of substance,
pretty sticky (although I'm not sure how it would withstand being at the
front of a bus with all the wind hitting it). 

We sell the emblems, by the way.
