Subject: Priming the carb
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have got a 73 Bus with a 1700 cc, type 4 engine with a single weber carb
setup that has typically given me worry free operation.  I have had zero
problems with my bus other than carbuaration.  I rebuilt the carb last year
and disconnected the choke (per Muir) and it has ran well until the last
couple of days were I have got to prime the carb to start the bus.

What could be the problem ?  Is it the choke that I disconnected ? Or do I
need to give up $250 for a new carb and be done with it !

TIA
