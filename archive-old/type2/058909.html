Subject: Re: Points Burned Up?

I just heard that letting a bus sit with the ignition switch on, but without the engine running (listening to the radio, etc) can burn up your points!?
Can anybody confirm this?
Is replacing the points a tough thing to do?

&gt;ben ~ i've also heard of points burning from leaving the switch on, but i'm no expert. i have had your symptoms (rough idle, low power) that improved w/new points, which are really easy to replace, just a little time consuming. any repair book will give the procedure (Muir, Bentley, Haines) step-by-step, or i can email them to you if you're bookless. good luck!
