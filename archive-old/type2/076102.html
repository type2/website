Subject: Re: [T2] Re: oil filter cross reference

Oops... Silly me.  On the type2 list I naturally assumed that we were
speaking of the 1700-2000 cc air-cooled motor.  On a wasserboxer, use
only the correct filter. (And Fram doesn't make one!)

&gt; &gt; Blake, thanks for responding.  Someone else responded stating that the
&gt; &gt; 75-84 Rabbit (gas engine) is the one I want.  They also stated the
&gt; &gt; Vanagon Wasserboxer uses the same filter.
&gt; 
&gt; Not that it's directly relevant to the original question, but the above
&gt; statement is not entirely correct. You can use a Vanagon wasserboxer oil
&gt; filter on a Rabbit, but you cannot use a Rabbit oil filter on a watercooled
&gt; Vanagon. The correct Vanagon oil filter (as sold by Volkswagen, Mann, and
&gt; Mahle) adds a check valve that prevents oil starvation at startup, a feature
&gt; specified by VW themselves but NOT found (or required) on the Rabbit oil
&gt; filter.  S
