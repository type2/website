&gt; As far as I know, the fumes coming from my tailpipe are darker (not belching

&gt; other part isn't working.

Again I would get him to verify all parts per Bentley.

&gt; The other part might be described as a positive vacuum valve, although I don't
&gt; know. It is disc shaped with one male connection on one side and two on the
&gt; other. Two tubes attach to one side and another on the other side which leads
&gt; into the fuel regulator. It's a Bosch. I called the Bus Depot to get the part
&gt; (with the part number) and they said it is obsolete and not produced anymore.

I now know what part you are talking about. it's the Decel Valve. My
limited understanding of the Decel valve is that it simply helps your
engine use less fuel when coasting or decelerating by providing a path
for the air to go.
