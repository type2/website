Subject: Re: [T2] New Seats (was '69 sunroof project)

Hi,
I'm not sure about bolting right up, but almost all
Saab's had heated seats as standard items.  My 1979
Saab 99 had heated seats and the same Bosch FI system
as my bus.  You might need to do a little welding but
as I recall the seats were very comfy.

&gt; &gt;and maybe (is this a crazy idea?) heated seats
&gt; swapped out of a junked
&gt; &gt;Audi 5000 or some such car since I'll be moving to
&gt; Montana in two years.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a idea I like... can anybody on the list
&gt; point me at car seats that 
&gt; will go into a stock '72 bus? Or will I have to do
&gt; some welding and so forth 
&gt; to get something in?
