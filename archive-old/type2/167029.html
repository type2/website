It's more like 7.5: + 24: = 31.5: at that throttle opening.

Engines that are timed 27: at 3500rpm are all probably setup for
higher CR than the bus with the dished pistons and require less
advance. They also tended to have 98 RON recommendations.

With that engine you have, I wouldn't time it at 7.5BTDC with the
205P distributor.
