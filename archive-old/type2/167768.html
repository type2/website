John,

For your purpose, getting them out will require patience and some 
penetrating oil.  There are other methods, but mostly destroy the stud 
coming out.  Use two nuts tightened together on the stud and then try 
slowly backing them out using only the nut closest to the head.


Not sure about the size and length, take one out and take it with 
you....they may be different for the intake and the exhaust.

How much is your time worth?  If you have all day, sure, take your time 
getting them out....are they really worth it?...after xxx thousand miles?

Your new heads came without studs in them????

Actually, you may be able to get the studs at your local home depot or 
lowes....lowes actually has some stainless metric hardware as well, in 
common sizes.

FLAPS might be better as their prices should be better.  The ones at Lowes 
and home depot are going to be expensive by the piece.

Since you are going to need more than a couple, you might try a local
nut and bolts supply house....once you figure out the size.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Thanks for the theories and explanations on studs over bolts.
&gt;
&gt; To perpetuate the boring topic :-) anyone know the best source of studs for
&gt; the head, and should I just try to remove the existing ones from the head
&gt; being removed, to install on the 'new' one, or should I only use new
&gt; hardware?
&gt;
&gt; I doubt I will find it at home depot &lt;g&gt; Would a FLAPS have the studs, or is
&gt; it a dealer item?
&gt;
&gt; Where can I find the thread size and overall length?
&gt;
&gt; Do I really want to use a torch on the head, to get the studs out?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for all the good advice.
