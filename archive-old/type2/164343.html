Subject: Re: [T2] valve adjustment on 78 Transporter

This falls under the heading of &quot;fix it 'till it breaks&quot;
The best time to make an adjustment is right after you
just did it, for surely it will fail if you don't.
Unfortunately, the information you seek is hidden (in books).
Do you hear a faint tapping noise in your sleep lately?
Now that you are aware of potential neglect of
preventive maintainance procedures, you will have
to establish a complete regimen of neverending
LOF schedules, brake adjustments, polishing crankshafts, etc.!

There is nothing wrong with a verification procedure,
it may come in handy on the road should you need the
ability to solve a valve train problem (sometime real soon!).

Ask your friend how he gets 200+HP out of a 1600cc.
I would appreciate the formula.
