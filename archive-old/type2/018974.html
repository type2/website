Subject: Help, just bought my first bus
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 216.206.223.66

Greetings,
I just brought home my first bus, a 1974 Campmobile, and I am in love!!  I
have a couple of questions if anyone can help.

1.  My bus has a single carb, but I thought they had duals, am I mistaken,
or has some type of conversion been done?  Should I have concwens about
this?

2.  Underneath the bus in the center there is what appears to be a large
radiator/heat exchanger type of device with hoses coming out of each end.
Two of the hoses are in the engine compartment, where the auxiliary bettery
would be, but are not connected. Not sure yet where the other two end up.
Any ideas.

3. There is no aux battery, will the fridge work anyway, or does it neeed
the other battery.  I plugged it in to A/C and it did nothing, I will need
to investigate further.

Any other tips for a new owner?

Thanks,
