Subject: 1970 Westy for sale in N. Gerogia

Hi all,
     I have a 1970 Westy for sale.  It has rust in the front floor boards,
and no canvis in the poptop.  Bus is complete (except for the front and rear
bumpers), and runs.  I am asking $700.00 for it, but I will come down
(bottom price is $550.00) for listmembers.  If you are interested, reply to
this message, or send me an e-mail at home.  My home
e-mail address is vwstuart_at_webtv_dot_net
	Also, I have decided to part out a '72 sunroof.  No front window,
engine or trans., and no door locks/handles.  All the rest is avaliable.

Both busses are located in LaFayette, GA (about 30 miles south of
Chattanooga, TN, and 80 miles north or Atlanta, GA)
Thanks,
Stuart Neil
