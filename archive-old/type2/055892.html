&gt;I've been talking to another listmember about purchasing a swamp cooler for
&gt;our '72 bus. In theory it sounds like a great idea, especially for driving
&gt;here in NC. I would like to here from anyone who has any experience using
&gt;one.

I would think your humidity would be too high in NC for a evaporative cooler
to work well. If the relative humidity is above 50% they work poorly. They
work great in the desert and not at all on the sea coast and some where
inbeteen in-between.
