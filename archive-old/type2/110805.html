&gt; BTW, just why is it that you cannot re-key the door handle locks??  Will
&gt; everyone have the same problem, that is, the handles are made such that they

The current line of aftermarket handles have lock cylinders similar to
those on newer VWs (80's and 90's, that is.).  This cylinder is not
compatible with the baywindow era keys.

Anyone purchasing new reproduction handles and locks will have this
problem.
