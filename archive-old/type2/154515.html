Subject: CANADIANS:  FS: '71 Westy (20+ years in indoor storage)

Posted to the Syncro list.  Not mine; please do not email me as I know
nothing more about it.  Westies that have spent the last 20+ years in indoor
storage are rare finds these days, and '71 is a desirable year. Sorry, no
email address provided, only a phone number. Please try not to overload
Canada's telephone network. :-)

My name is Bernhardt  Zeisig and I am trying to help my parents sell their
VW camper.  I don't  know if you are the right contact but was hoping that
you might be able to put  me in touch with someone that might be able to
help? My parents are in  their 90's and they own a 1971 VW pop up camper.
It has been indoors for  20+ years, original paint and is in excellent
condition.  I have no  idea of its value or how best to sell it.  Is there
anyone that I can talk  to?

Thank you very  much,

Bernhardt  Zeisig
