&gt; There is also a &quot;Oil leak dye&quot; chemical you put in the oil, and run the
&gt; engine, and then shine a infrared light on the suspected area. Any oil that
&gt; is leaking will show as purple or orange depending on type of oil your
&gt; checking.
&gt;     Its like a 60's bar with a black light system, with the Stones and
Doors
&gt; on the juke box. While you do your best &quot;Shing-a-ling&quot; in your tie dyed
&gt; ruffled shirt and white bell bottoms.
&gt; Man these flash backs are killing me!!!

&gt;    Augustus Stanley Owlsley III makes a nice black light...and you
can lick the box...8-)
