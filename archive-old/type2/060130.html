Subject: Re: Wiring for relay of  second battery for 79 Westy

The relay you describe sounds identical to the relay on my 77 Westy.
This relay connects the possitive post of the 2 batteries ONLY when the
alternator is producing power. This keeps the aux battery from draining
the main battery until the engine is running. 

On my bus the aux battery only powered the fridge - however, I've
re-wired it as follows:

I moved the aux battery to under the back seat (I got sick of wrestling
that darn aux battery out of its slot every winter). I disconnected the
main bus power wire that runs from the starter to the front of the car.
I connected this wire to my aux battery. Now everything (except the
starter) runs off my aux battery. This way I can't drain my main
starting battery by running accessories when camping. (If I drain my aux
battery, I need to disconnect it and close the charging relay to get
power to pull in the starter solenoid).

That little stock relay was not sufficient to handle the current for the
entire car, however. I put in an RV dual battery relay between
batteries. I still use the original relay to trigger the bigger one
since I was not sure how much current pulling in that big relay took.
