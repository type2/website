Hey Yall
I'm replacing a fuel pump in my 1600DP (1971 westy). There is a minor fuel 
leak coming out of the bottom and I'm hittin the road soon. The procedure 
from Bently and Muir look pretty simple - questions though:

1.I have moly grease and disc brake grease in my collection - will either of 
these do or should I get something else, specifically what - to pack in the 
pump when I put it in?
2.Do I have to mess with the bottom half - that part that goes into the case 
- since I'm not replacing that part? If so, do I have to do the manual 
engine crank to get the thing at its highest stroke? (sorry for the lack of 
terminology - I'm not near my bus or manuals right now.)
3. Are the two paper gaskets that came with my Brazilian pump sufficient? I 
seem to remember something about more shims and I don't think any came with 
it. When I get back to town, I leave the next day on my road trip and may 
have to replace the pump on the road, so want to make sure I have all I 
need.

Thanks!
Wink
