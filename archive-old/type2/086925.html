&gt; Volks,

&gt; I came across a restored 1960 SO-23 Westy yesterday,
&gt; the guy is asking somewhere around $10,000 for it.  

wheeeh,  wish I had a kept mine,  I had a 23 window 1960 deluxe microbus,
not a camper.  now it was only a few years old when I bought it, so these
are ancient memories

good.
.  it was kewl
.  it could carry a bunch of folks
.  1st gear was so low I could pull stumps, well not really but I moved
Railroad rail with it once!
.  easy to work on
.  yes it really does float (ask me how I know!)

bad
.  power was non existant
.  speed was equally non existant
.  dang sunroof leaked like sieve, never could get it tight
.  was about the worst handling bus I have ever owned, but since it
couldn't get out of it's own way going downhill with a tailwind that was
not that big a problem.  

I would imagine body parts are next to impossible to find nowdays and if
it is that nice, would you really want to drive it???

 Thought I'd post this to the T2 list in case there's
&gt; some folks on here w/ knowledge of the bus, who might
&gt; not be on the VB list.  (To everyone else, sorry about
&gt; the bandwidth!  Also, my apologies to those on both
&gt; lists...  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; It's the nicest split window bus that I've ever seen
&gt; around these parts, nice enough that I'm considering
&gt; trading my cherry '82 diesel westy (+ cash) for it,
&gt; but I'd like some input from others who have more
&gt; knowledge about the early westies before I make a
&gt; move.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's what I know - the Bus lived much of it's life
&gt; on the West Coast, and was restored out there before
&gt; coming back east.  
&gt; 
&gt; The good:
&gt; 
&gt; It has the complete large tent and the roof rack.  Not
&gt; original paint, but a very nice respray.  Nice
&gt; straight repainted bumpers.  Decent tires (not sure if
&gt; proper load index though...), brakes and tranny all
&gt; good.  No loud whine from the redux boxes, tranny
&gt; stays in gear, and shifter play is minimal. Converted
&gt; to 12 volt (good and bad I guess...), 40HP
&gt; (non-bastard).  Runs nice, minimal play in steering
&gt; box (quite nice!).  I completely inspected the
&gt; underside - nice and solid w/ surface rust only (best
&gt; underside I've personally viewed).  Has original
&gt; church key and radio block off plate.  The interior is
&gt; complete, w/ a few exceptions noted below.  Window
&gt; seals have all been replaced in the last five years,
&gt; as have the door seals, etc.  Basically, all new
&gt; seals.  :-)  Deluxe campbox interior, including
&gt; icebox.  Original upholstery on the rear camper seats
&gt; still!  Complete camper interior (w/ 2 exceptions -
&gt; glasses and ???netting??? - see below).  Tent,
&gt; outside, and inside upholstery all match!  (ironic, as
&gt; I'm color blind and have a helluva time matching
&gt; colors.....)
&gt; 
&gt; The bad:  
&gt; 1) Considerably staining on the ceiling wood.  (Kind
&gt; of cool in a way though, gives it a nice patina....)
&gt; 2) *Considerable* bubbling from the paint on the pass.
&gt; side roof - above the rain gutter - which is kind of
&gt; sCaReY.  My guess is that the sub-hatch leaked, and
&gt; that this is coming through from the INSIDE.... :-( 
&gt; (This is the only rust I could find on the painted
&gt; surfaces tho, and I went over them very thoroughly -
&gt; didn't have a magnet for bondo though....)  Will if I
&gt; go back. (Respray was 5+ years ago fwiw.)
&gt; 3) Incorrect front door panels and front seat
&gt; upholstery, although they are nicely done.  Not a huge
&gt; deal to me, although I'd probably redo them at some
&gt; point in the future if I bought the bus.
&gt; 
&gt; The missing:  
&gt; 1) Appears to have mid-60's mirrors on the outside
&gt; (both sides)...(although I may be wrong here.)  
&gt; 2) No cups, no shot glasses (has breadbox and holder
&gt; though.  
&gt; 3) Doesn't appear to have the correct wiper arms.  
&gt; 4) Chrome hubcaps (although these may be correct -
&gt; didn't look at M-codes....)  
&gt; 5) Does not have the cargo net in the back, although
&gt; it may not have had one (optional I've read...)
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, I first heard about this bus several years
&gt; ago.  Finally tried to track it down a few months ago,
&gt; did, and found out it's for sale.  Viewed the bus
&gt; (it's in storage) on short notice, very clean engine
&gt; (inside and underneath).  Not sure when rebuilt, or
&gt; original miles...  But it's the nicest splitty I've
&gt; ever seen outside a show, and the only thing holding
&gt; me back at this point is the bubbling on the roof. 
&gt; Plus the fact that I really don't want to pay a whole
&gt; lot more than it's worth, as there's one on the
&gt; thesamba_dot_com now (a '59) for 11K.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you folks think?  Any and all input would be
&gt; GREATLY appreciated!
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, ~j.
