&gt; I know it doesn't weigh near that. More like 3700 with all my gear.

run it over a set of scales, I've used the state police ones at the state
line when they weren't busy, bet your off by 1000lbs


&gt; Can anybody out there come up with a proper Michlein tire number that's
&gt; going to be correct?

I have Michelin MXT, but I think it has a new name/code....someone said
Agelis or something, they are 1,900+ lb rating (I'm running 205/R70,14
other sizes may vary)

&gt; NO! I would not consider changing brands. 

neither would I
