&gt; Yes, the doghouse fan, for instance, displaces about  35.000 Liters

Something is wrong with these numbers.  Comparing the airflow under the
engine to the airflow going into the carb using my highly-calibrated
fingers, I'd expect to see a 10+:1 ratio between cooling air and carb air.

Anyway, the amount of air flow is, to use a scientific term, a whole
bunch.  No intakes (including baywindows) really face forward, and all of
them are in the boundary layer of the bus.  No ram air effect should be
expected.

&gt; [scoops] for Bugs, Buses, VW used them on the Thing/181, and the have
been 
&gt; copied by many fiberglass 'specialists'. The thing is, that there is almost 
&gt; no way that you can force more air through the stock fanshroud, that 
&gt; would take a considerable amount of pressure,

No, but that bit of positive pressure might be the thing that prevents
some recirculation from below (through bad seals, etc.) and could make
things run cooler in a badly-maintained bus.

I just wish that someone made rubber seals with the truly correct shape
for my '71 and earlier buses.  The main engine-to-tin seal is a simple
extrusion that wrinkles when installed in the channel surrounding the
engine.  Air (and dust) definitely leaks by.
