Subject: Norcold refrigerators

I am thinking of replaceing the ice box in my 72 sporsmobile with a refrigerator.I see they have norcold ref. in the J.C.whitney book but they are not cheap!If anybody has done this can you tell me if it is worth the swap or will I simply be throwing good money away.Maybe someone can offer a better idea than norcold.
Thanks.Tim Linke-72 Frankenbus
