Greetings, has anyone removed dash and wiring from a bus and tranplanted it
into another.  I've got a 74 bus dash that is rusty and has been cut and the
wiring is just a mess.  I've picked up wrecked 78 bus that has a beautiful
dash and all the wiring is intact and everything works except the roof comes
to a point in the center and the passenger side is crushed.  I'm dreaming of
pulling the dash from the 74 and replacing it with dash from 78.  I would
like to some how use as much of the wiring harnass from the 78 as possible.
How big of a hassle would I be getting in to?    Thanks is advance for tips
and info.  Marcus

74 bus automatic - would like to goto EB2002
78 bus donor wrecked.
