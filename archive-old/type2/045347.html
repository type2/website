This is what I've been hearing.  I'm really tight for space -- I'm
working on hardstanding that's no more than a foot wider than the bus
and four feet longer than the bus.  Removing the engine in such space
isn't something I relish, so I'm going about it the hard way.

I may end up having to drop the engine.  I'm stubborn, but not *that*
stubborn.

My thanks for the advice, both to you and the other listees who mailed
me.

Cheers,

Chris.
