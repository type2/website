Subject: Re: Gas Leak,  Aaaack!!!!
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;Every time I make a Left turn, I can see a trail of gas left behind as I
&gt;mosey on along.
&gt;Comming from my assumption the fuel filler neck. (I put on a new gas cap to
&gt;no avail)
&gt;    My problem is this, How do I get to the fuel filler neck without pulling
&gt;the engine or cutting into the firewall?????
&gt;Thanks to all &amp; Keep on Bussin!!!!!!!!

The only way to fix this problem is to replace both rubber elbows on the
filler neck they get hard and crack from age.  And the only way to get to
the lower one is to pull the tank out by removing the panel at the front of
the engine bay.  I don't think you can do this (or at least it is much more
difficult) with the engine in the bus.

If anyone has their engine out and has not done this, now would be the
perfect time.

By the way, does anyone on the list know who carries these rubber elbows?
I havn't replaced any in a while and I don't remember who I ordered them
from the last time.  Thanks
