Some further details:

1972 Type IV engine (pancake)

Manual Transmission.

I'm also wishing I had a 73 right now.. that top access panel would be very 
handy-dandy.

I've got two hydraulic floor jacks.. and it's definately hanging on the input 
shaft. I'm going to get a large pair of channel locks and attempt to push the 
shaft back.. but I can see a good 3 inches between the bell-housing and 
engine.

*sigh*
