Eek.

If I were you, I'd stop driving it, drain the oil, and see if the rest 
of the oil is thin and smells of gas.  If it is, then you have fuel 
getting past your rings and into the case.

My guess would be that you either have an excessively rich mixture (did 
it smell like it was running rich before?), or you have a cylinder 
that's not firing (which could let fuel pool up in the cylinder).  If 
your cylinders/rings are weak, then that could exacerbate these 
problems by letting the fuel past the rings and into the oil more 
quickly.

Now, once you've put in new oil and filter, you can check for 
non-firing cylinder by running the engine and pulling and reinstalling 
the plug wires one by one.  If you pull the wire on a cylinder and the 
engine RPMs/idle doesn't change, then that's your bad cylinder.

If you have a compression gauge, then do a compression test.  If you 
don't, and you have a VW-capable mechanic[*] near-by, and you can 
afford it, then get a leak-down test done (this test is superior to a 
compression test).  When I had one done recently, the mechanic charged 
1/2 hour labor, so it shouldn't be too expensive to get this test done, 
and it can tell you a lot about how good or bad of shape your cylinders 
and valves are in.  (Unfortunately, it told me I needed a top-end 
rebuild :-)

[*] Any mechanic should be able to do a leak-down test, but my policy 
is to always have VW-savvy people work on a VW.
