Subject: Re: Corvair engine installation

Used to be fairly common, but as Corvairs became more rare it was less
common.  Big problem was that the corvair engine ran in the opposite
direction of the VW engine, requiring a reverse-rotation cam and ignition
to work properly, and at that there apparently was some problem with the
distributor drive.

Flopping the ring gear in the transmission was another approach, but this
led to short transmission life due to the gears running with the wrong
contact surfaces in play.

the last method was to transplant an entire corvair engine and
transmission into the bus.  These apparently worked pretty well, even
giving the option of an automatic transmission.

I think I would rather do this to a late bay, not a '71.
