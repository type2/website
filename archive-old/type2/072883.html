Subject: Re: Sad News--Josh Rodgers

Any time I mentioned the possibilty of scrapping a bus, Josh instantly
wrote offering to tow it to his pasture, a true fiend.
He seemed like a good guy, and I sure am sorry he never felt he could talk
to us about whatever problems occupied his mind.
I will always feel it is my loss that we never met in person; any one going
to meet his kith and kin, please tell them how many friends he had, close
and casual, who will miss him.
