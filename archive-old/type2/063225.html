10/70 would definitely be a '71.

&gt; Thing is, we just noticed a Westphalia sticker on a cabinet (previuously covered 
&gt; by old carpeting) that says Campmobile 70.

Maybe the cabinet's out of a '70 bus, though I've owned both a '70 and a
'71 and the sticker on both of mine simply said Campmobile.

Crawl under the bus and look up toward the driver's seat. Is there a big
round covered dish turned sideways next to the master cylinder? That's
your brake booster. It was on the '71's and not on the '70s. There should
be a line going from this back to a spot just below the carburator. Good
thing you have this, it helps your bus stop MUCH better than earlier
models. ;) Joe
