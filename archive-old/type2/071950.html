&gt;Seeing as everyone else is talking about valves tonight....
&gt;
&gt;I bought a set of new 37.5x40 heads from Mark Stephens last
&gt;year, but am finally getting around to working them over
&gt;for installation. I ploshed up the really rough intake and exaust
&gt;ports to keep them clean and to help flow, and knocked the
&gt;rough stuff off of the combustion chamber walls. I also
&gt;stoned some major roughness off of the valve
&gt;cover sealing surfaces.
&gt;
&gt;But, when I went to lapp in the valves I discovered that
&gt;the seats have been cut to 60 degrees, while the
&gt;valves are cut to 45 degrees. It looked like the Mark Stephens
&gt;guy did the first step of my 3 angle valve job and forgot
&gt;steps 2 and three!! (I think I waited too long to bring it
&gt;to their attention now)

I would call Mark Stephens on it.  I just talked to them last week and they
seemed like reasonable people.  Since it is pretty obvious that they made a
mistake here, I don't think they would have a problem with making it right,
even if you've had the heads laying around for a few months.  I also picked
up a pair of heads from them - I think I'm gonna go pull the valves and
make sure mine match the seats.  :-/

BTW, I let MSHP talk me into taking heads with inserts in the spark plug
holes.  I was not happy about it at first, but the guy swore that they send
these &quot;timeserts&quot; out in almost all of their rebuilt heads, and they have
only gotten one complaint of one coming out, and they said that it was in a
serious race application.  The guy swore I would not have any trouble as
long as I use anti-sieze on the spark plug threads.  If one of those
buggers pops out when I'm up in the boonies in Alaska, I'm going to be very
upset with Mark Stephens, but for now I am going to trust them.  The heads
otherwise looked excellent and were a very good deal for the money, I
thought.  They even have ports going into the valve cover area to vent
crankcase pressure - I like that since I'm having a small problem with
blowby at the moment.  The heads are a few cc's smaller so my compression
ratio will be going up to about 7.5-to-1 from 7.0.  If the engine runs
hotter or pings, I will unshroud the intake valves a bit and lower the
compression back down.  I went with 39mm intakes instead of 41 - I think
the 41's I have now were too big for my application (stock carbs) and are
costing me some low end torque.  I could ramble about this stuff all night
but I'll shut up and spare you all.  :-)
