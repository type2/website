&gt;&gt;  On the VW aircooled , 4 cylinder puppy, it does one of each every other
stroke.
&gt;&gt;  This is  called a &quot;2 stroke &quot; engine.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;uhhhhh.....sorry Mike but I think you mean this is a 4 stroke
&gt;engine.....
&gt;
&gt;

 Well - if I was perfect, you'd all hate me!

 4 stroke it is.
