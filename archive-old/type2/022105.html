Subject: Re: eating clutch cables
Mime-Version: 1.0

From: David Conner -
----------------------
I am in the process of putting yet another clutch cable on my 68 bus. 
It will be my third one in less than a year. 
All have broken at the same place. At the front of the bus, right there 
where the cable goes into the metal that forms the attachment that the pin 
goes through. 
---------------------
This from ancient memory (since once I solved it, I've never broken
another), but:

Aside from a shoddy cable, one reason that clutch cables can break there on
68-71's is that there is a right way and a wrong way possible to attach the
clevis pin/eyelet on the cable end to the hook on the clutch pedal
extension.  That is, the hook can be 'upside down' so that it does not pull
the cable directly in line, and so stresses the cable at the crimp to the
eyelet.  Carefully scope out the two different ways that the two parts can
join, and see if the other arrangement doesn't resolve this.  I found the
pictures in the Bentley manual valuable here.
Nick..
