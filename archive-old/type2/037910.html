Subject: Re: RPM and Gas Mileage

Matt -

The service manuals I have shows that stock motors put out maximum torque at
about 3200-ish RPM, which should be the motor's most efficient speed. See
Scott &amp; Maggie's RPM/MPH calculator at:

http://www.scottandmaggie_dot_com/gearcalc.asp

to find out what your corresponding MPH would be. Just because that's the
motors most efficient RPM doesn't mean you get the best MPG at that speed.
Pushing a breadbox down the road at 65 takes more throttle than pushing it
down the road at 55, what, with the drag co-efficient and all. I don't know
of a MPH/MPG calculator yet, but one thing is clear - the slower you go, the
better your gas mileage. How many MPG do you want?

&gt; I have heard that the VW engine gets best gas
&gt; mileage  between 3,000 and 3,500. I think that this may be a little high.
&gt; When i run at about 65 on the highway, my RPM's are about 3200, and i
really
&gt; dont go any faster than that. My normal shift point seems to be around
2900
&gt; to 3100, and it seems weird to think that my engine's optimal range is
higher
&gt; than my shift point.
&gt;   Anybody care to share your opinion on this?
