&gt;I've got another question - where the steel wheels are concerned - somebody mentioned that they were stock Bus wheels welded to a new 15&quot; rim.

That was me.  I called GoWesty and that's what they told me.

&gt; I know this is possible but if that were true then wouldn't a stock hubcap fit just dandy??? (Somebody else mentioned the stock hubcap wouldn't fit).

They confirmed that the stock hubcap would indeed fit.

&gt;I'm a &quot;deal-hunter&quot; not picking on GoWesty - as long as they aren't taking advantage of us.

Where the steel wheels are concerned, I don't think they are taking advantage because I don't think anyone else sells such a wheel and for what you're getting their price is very fair IMO.
