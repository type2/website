&gt;Questions: I've got a disabled Main idling electromagnetic cut-off jet. Do I
&gt;need a functioning one and if not, must I keep a wire attached to it?

You need to either have a functioning one or plug the hole.  As an
alternative, you might also try what I did which was to stack a couple of
washers over the threads so that it doesn't screw in far enough to shut off
the airflow even when the electricity is not hooked up.  In this case of
course you don't need to keep the wire attached.

&gt;Not satisfied with the little light metal intake manifold gaskets, I bought
&gt;some different larger intake gaskets from mofoco, shaped more like the
&gt;bakelite gaskets
&gt;on the FI engines. Not sure which intake gaskets people have had success with?

The metal ones will work okay.  If the surface of the heads and/or
manifolds is not baby-butt smooth, they will leak a little.  Not enough to
keep your engine from idling properly, but enough that carb cleaner sprayed
at the base of the carbs will change your idle.  The thick bakelite gaskets
are to be used with fuel injection only.  The kits usually come with both.
There are two problems with the thicker gaskets - first, they will cause
the carbs to be farther apart which means your crossbar will no longer fit.
It may or may not be in the range of adjustment by bending flanges and
tilting brackets - I haven't tried.  Second, depending on the length of
your intake studs you may not have enough thread left to install the nuts
that hold the manifolds on.  You could install longer studs, but really,
the metal gaskets are probably not the source of your problem.

&gt;Between the Carb and the intake manifolds, I have these same bakelite gaskets
&gt;in the single rather than double variety.

That is by design.

&gt;The carb rebuild kits only come
&gt;with one
&gt;carb base gasket. It seems like there should also be a base gasket between
&gt;the
&gt;bakelite and the manifold (vacuum)

Sounds reasonable - I definately have both on my bus.  These you can cut
&gt;from gasket paper if need be - they are fairly simple.

&gt; - are these bakelites necessary to
&gt;maintain
&gt;the head for the air cleaner or some more important reason?

My guess is that they are meant as a phenolic spacer, to keep heat from
transfering from the manifolds to the carbs, but I don't really know.

&gt;One last one. The outsides of my intake manifolds each have a large plug
&gt;screwed
&gt;into the end, which are tightened with a 36mm wrench. Anyone ever experienced
&gt;these before?

The plugs should have vacuum ports in the middle - at least that's how I've
seen them.  Part of some smog hookups I think, and I also think that those
were only on '74 busses.  Again, I'm not completely sure.
