Subject: Re: [T2] S boot redesign

Jim said:


 The only &quot;S&quot; Boot that's been in prototyping stage so far is for the Vanagon 80-83 Air Cooled and eventually
the Wasserboxer Vanagons.  Airhead/VWG may look into doing the Bay Window &quot;S: Boot eventually, but minimum
production runs (1000 pc minimum), material &amp; tooling costs, the marketability and the
end cost to the consumer is what will make or break on doing this &quot;S&quot; Boot.
VW gets around $70 to $80 for a Wasserboxer &quot;S&quot; Boot and we feel that's way too high to begin with - we wanna
target around $40 to $50 tops.  I honestly don't think the average Bay Window Owner is gonna wanna shell out
$120.
Most Bay Window owners (and these are mostly off-list) I still encounter have ripped out their FI and moved
onto carbs or are resistant to spending more than what they can get away with in the &quot;baling wire&quot; department
to just get down the road.  I have to keep in mind that this List (as great and as &quot;picky&quot; as they are [and
rightly so]) is just a microcosm of Bay Window owners everywhere, thus reproduction of anything has to be
based on the
&quot;bigger&quot; picture of being able to do it and still stay in business (and pay my meager wage [remember, I'm just
a peon now, not an owner anymore], along with others).

I'll have to look in my stash to make sure, but I think I have a couple of nice used ones I've picked in my
travels - $35 including postage.  I might find another or more this weekend at the Hot VWs Drag Day Swap this
Sunday. I always keep my eyes peeled for these.

I think I gave you one for the pattern to make them :)

I have a bunch of good bay S hoses and a couple of Vanagon S hoses, but I no longer save them anymore.....  No
one seems to want them and I have to much crap to move 650 miles.
