Subject: Re: [T2] PurchasingTires 

first, i would suggest knowing _exactly_ what tires you want. you seem to
already have a good handle on this given your description.

try http://www.tirerack_dot_com i have had 3 very positive experiences with
them.  i have also heard other list memebers positively comment on
http://www.etires_dot_com

recently i ordered the Yokohama Y356 Load Range D for $58 each. (+ shipping)

the C load range for the same tire was $50 (approx).

if you go with the Yoko Y356, realize it is _not_ an all-conditions
type of tire. its made for highway use &amp; i can report first-hand it
is a good tire in the rain.  it is _not_ rated for mud or snow.

i also once purchased the Bridgestone 603V for a very similar price, but
did not keep that vehicle long enough to give feedback regarding tire
performance.

good luck,
