Subject: Wheel Swap Bus / Vanagon

Are the original steel wheels for a '72 Bus and an '85 Vanagon the same?  I
have reinforced tires (Bridgestone 603V 185R14) on my '72 that I would like
to put on my new '85 Westy until I can afford to get a new set of
Continental Contact CR21 - 185R14 for the Vanagon.  A quick check on
busdepot_dot_com indicates the same steel wheel part # for 71-91 Bus/Vanagon.  I
just wanted to double check this with the list before I swap them over.

							Thanks in advance,
							Jay Brown
