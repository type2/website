I think it got bumped back a year to the &quot;real&quot; (?) millenial turn
2000-20001 (for those who conveniently forgot the calendar is out by
several years anyway, and we've been in the third millenium for years
already...).  The trip web site (see http://www.vanagon_dot_com, follow the
&quot;journeys&quot; link) shows a planned departure date of Sept 2000.

Don't know the full scoop on this, since I won't be going and haven't heard
anything from Ron in quite a while.
