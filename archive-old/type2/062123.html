Subject: 2/1800 problems

     I have a 72 bus with a 74 2/1800 twin carb.  After a week with 
   no exhaust, I replaced it. Now I have no power, it won't go above 
   30 mph. I checked cap, rotor, plug wires, plugs, points, valve 
   clearance.  When It was running the timing was at 20 deg. atdc.
   compression check says approx. 35 psi each cylinder. I have not 
   done wet test yet.
     Any hints on what to do?
