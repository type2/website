Subject: RE: [T2] Back door cargo rubber ?

 There are distinct differences between the;
211 829 193C (1964 to 1971) and the 211 829 193E (1972 to 1979) rear hatch
seals.

 The 211 829 193C has sharper upper corners, a different profile (close but
a little different) and different notches on the bottom. The 211 829 193E
has  more rounded upper corners, different profile and different notches on
the bottom.

  I just went out to my storage lot and looked at both a 1971 and a 1972 bus
with original rear hatch seals and verified the fact. It does appear that
either seal would fit in any year of bay window and it really would be a
matter of how anal retentive you want to be concerning the seal.

  I do stock both numbers and they both have the VW logo and VW part number
molded in them. I do they get directley from a source from Germany and have
been told that these are made in Germany for VW.
  The 1950 to 1963 part number is 211 829 193 up to chassis no# 1 144 281

ps. The 211 829 193E are still available from your local VW dealer (cost
unknown).

&gt; So in either case, $79.95 gets you the best available quality.  Our part #
211 829 193E.

Ron, are you sure about this part number?
On your 68+ listing, you list 68-79 as all being the same.
I believe 64 to 71 is the same, but 72-79 is different :

Rear Cargo Hatch Seal, Genuine VW !! 68-79 Bus
$89.95  211 829 193E

But if you go to 50-67 listing, then you show the correct part #:

Rear Cargo Hatch Seal, 64-71 Bus Genuine VW
$89.95  211 829 193C
