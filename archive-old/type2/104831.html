Subject: Side marker lens seal

Hi friendly list,

A Belgian friend of mine has side markers on his bus. That is a rare thing on
European buses because it is mainly used on American buses.

He can't find the proper seals for his side marker lenses. His old seals are
dried out.

Does anyone know where i can get these seals?
Details are: Hella MR70 lenses, VW partnumber 211 945 161. This number is on
the lens itself, but we are looking for the seals.

Does anyone know a good resource for these items? We are looking for four
seals that can be shipped to Belgium.
