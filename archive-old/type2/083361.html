Subject: Parts for sale!!!

Hello List,
 Well , I am all out of Pushrod tube seals. I ended up
selling 3 sets! The exhaust gaskets have been spoken
for as well as the 2 engine seals. I do have a few
other things left here to sell if any one is
interested. I tried to make each item either cheeper
than the price I bought them for or cheeper than the
lowest price I could find for each item so keep that
in mind. Thanks to everyone that has replied so far.
Every penny helps toward buying another engine!

Item #1
 One complete set of kolbenringe N FORM GOETZE Piston
rings for 411/412 1.7L 90x2+2+5 mm part # 08-397900-10
These rings were bought new in 07/22/96.These piston
rings are currently being sold for $45.00 a set. I am
asking $32.00 with free shipping to the contenential
US. 
Item #2

Item #5
3 intake and 5 exhaust valve guides. I want $5.00 for

Item #6
A set of rebuilt rods from Just the Best rebuilders. I

5.50 shipping.
Item #7
1 set of sodium exhaust valves for 72-79, except for
1974 34mm valve, also 80-83 Vanagon. I paid $65.00 for
them. These disapate the high heat that exhaust valves
face much more effeciently than standard valves. I
will let them go at $60.00 with free shipping to
contential US.

I am sorry that this message is so long. Please email
me if you are interested. If no one emails me with a
week, I will put these item on Eb_at_y. Thanks for
