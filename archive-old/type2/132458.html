Subject: RE: [T2] Rusty Front Brakes?

Jason,

Why not just call around to your local machine shops and take the rotors in
and have them resurfaced? You should be able to have them done for around
$25, and it's really the only way to do it right. Then coat them with
cosmoline, or a similar rust preventative available at gun supply stores
(that's how they're shipped when new). Possibly a lighter oil, like wd-40 or
a similar product made for marine use would be sufficient if it's going to
be on the road soon. This product http://www.boeshield_dot_com/ is available at
many marine supply stores. The rotors will have to be cleaned with solvent
and then brake cleaner before they are returned to service. Or, if it's only
going to be a little while longer, take them in right before you get the van
back on the road.

&gt; That said, I was jacking up the front to turn the wheels (a once-a-month
&gt; project), and I noticed that my brake rotors now have a fairly
&gt; thick coat of
&gt; rust from their 6-month hiatus.  My immediate thought was, &quot;what do I do
&gt; about that?&quot;, so I thought I would ask The List.
