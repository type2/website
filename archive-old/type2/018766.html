Subject: Type I-III Oil Pump in Type IV Engine?

Ok, so if the type IV oil pump is 30mm, and I can get a 30mm, 8mm stud,
large oil hole type I-III oil pump for less (for reference, I'm looking
at my RMMW catalog), would that be a good idea?  I'm wondering if the
inlet/outlet holes will match up.  Anything else I should worry about?
Does anyone have experience with this issue?
