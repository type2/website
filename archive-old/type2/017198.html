&gt; Hi all !!
&gt; 
&gt; Once again I must remenber you all that I have never had a VW  of any
&gt; kind in my entire life (well,  my dad bought a new Bettle back in 65 and
&gt; had it for 4 years but it doesn't  count) I do mechanics in my spare
&gt; time BUT NEVER EVER have had the oportunity to place my hands on a VW
&gt; engine before, untill now the I have this 73 Transporter.   Few days
&gt; back I posted a note saying that my pankace engine is leaking oil
&gt; apparently from everywere and is producing a lot of smoke because the
&gt; oil is dropping on the heaters.  I received some suggestions and I'm
&gt; working on it.  Now there's aproblem that I been having since the
&gt; beggining but dind't mentioned and is the fact that when I get stuck in
&gt; a traffic jam (twice a day) and it gets very hot, suddently the engine
&gt; stops.  I'm full with gas and the engine doesn't start,  I pour
&gt; gassoline directly in the carbs and the engine starts for a seccond and
&gt; then dies again,  then I take off the main gas line from the
&gt; LH/carburator and crank the engine and no gas comes out.  It isn't
&gt; untill 20 to 30 minutes that the engine starts with no problem.  This is
&gt; happening to me every 10 to 15 days.  What could it be ?.  I mean its
&gt; definetly the gas pump but what is going on ?. Why does it works some
&gt; times and some time not ?.  I'm looking forward to installing an
&gt; electric fuel pump, but since then, I have to deal with this.
&gt;  Has this ever happened to anybody in the list ??. Any comentaries are
&gt; highly appreciated.    Thanks  !!!!.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Pedro/
&gt; Caracas - Venezuela.
Pedro:
I'd look for a plugged fuel filter first- it seems like the 72-74's have
one someplace between the tank and pump, or maybe built into the pump
like a type 1. If your pump is bad, I'd just rebuild it. It seems like
kits are available for around $50 US. The stock pump delivers the right
pressure and is safe and trouble free, though it doesn't last as long as
the rest of the vehicle.
Another source of trouble might be debris in the tank. Just 
disconnecting the fuel pump inlet hose and draining some fuel into a
container should assure you if this is the case.
ALWAYS be real careful of fire danger when working around gasoline. One
cupful of gasoline on fire is enough to engulf your van (and your shop)
in flames. It's a good idea to do this outside and still have a fire
extinguisher handy.
It seems bus owners aren't the only ones w/ fire problems. At the local
John Deere factory on Monday they were servicing a new tractor, draining
the fuel, some fuel splashed onto a trouble light and engulfed the whole
thing on fire. And this was diesel with a much higher kindling
temperature! $175,000 damage, they said- would be a very bad day for me.
SO THE MAIN POINT AGAIN- BE EXTRA CAREFUL AROUND COMBUSTIBLES!
This goes for cleaning agents and paint thinners as well!
