Subject: Start Problem

Hello,

This is my first ever post to this list.  I have an 82 Vanagon, 
aircooled 2.0 litre.  One day a while back it wouldn't start.  It would 
only fire for a second or three then die.  I figured it might be flooded 
as the temp was -25 degrees C, a bit too cold really for operating an 
aircooled but it had already run  and only been shut down for about an 
hour.  Had it towed home and put it in my garage.  Checked the ignition 
that was good, changed the spark plugs, decided to change the pushrod 
tube seals on one side, that went okay.  I went away for a couple 
weeks.  When I got back figured it must be dried out but does the exact 
same thing, fires up for a few seconds and dies away.  I undid a fuel 
line and cranked the starter, lots of fuel coming out.  I've been deep 
into my Haines manual and type2_dot_com resources but I'm getting in a bit 
over my head.  Any ideas where to go next, cold start valve, thermotime 
switch?

Ashley
