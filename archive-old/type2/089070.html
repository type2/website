Subject: [T2] Weber manifold problem?


&gt; Just before bed the other night, i was
&gt; contemplating my Weber DFEV and its manifold -

I had a comment here, ( but chose to delete it :)

&gt; I noticed something - perhaps a new shortcoming
&gt; of this setup.  The carb functions such that the
&gt; primary throttle barrel does most of the work;
&gt; the secondary only begins to open at maybe a
&gt; little  under half throttle - maybe more, maybe
&gt; less.

The progressive linkage to the secondary
can be tweaked to open it sooner.
Yours seems about right.( more or less :).
