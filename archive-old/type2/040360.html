But don't forget ......  the split window buses have the ring gear flipped,
compared to the beeltle transmission.....   and they work over many, miles just
fine.......

&gt; --&gt; I've heard it claimed that flipping the ring gear in a VW transmission
&gt; (for example, to use it with a Corvair engine) makes it last about 5,000
&gt; miles instead of 500,000, due to everything turning the wrong direction
&gt; inside.  Might want to think twice about doing that to a Subaru tranny.
