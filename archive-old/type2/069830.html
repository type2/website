Subject: 74 Campmobile FS in MS, nice project

I checked out a 74 Campmobile (Westy) on Saturday that would make a
nice project. The body is really good with only a few spots that could
be easily touched up.
The interior was in disarray but seemed pretty complete including the
small hammock (for kids?) and a step stool with the matching upholstery
as the interior.

The van is not running now but the owner told me it could be going &quot;in
just a couple weekends&quot;. Since this van has been forsale for a couple
months, I wonder why he didn't get it going himself. Everything seems
to be there but I am a mechanical beginner and don't want to jump in
with a non running vehicle.

The van is located in Ocean Springs, Mississippi (east of Biloxi) and would have to be towed. The owner is asking $500 but I am not sure how firm that is.

If anyone is interested, email me and I will try to go into more detail.
I was quite interested at first because of the quality of the body and interior
but I am passing and looking at a running 75 Westy tonight that supposedly spent most of its life in Arizona.
