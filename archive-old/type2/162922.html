Subject: rapid response to low oil-P

	Soon after arriving in the USA in 1964 I met a Peace Corps 
volunteer recently returned from Ghana who recounted the following 
experience which may hold a lesson for us today.
	The main  -  almost the only  -  types of motor vehicle in 
rural Africa then were Land Rover, Peugeot 403, and VW.  The Peace 
Corps in Ghana had a small fleet of VW used by all and maintained by 
none.  One day my buddy was driving along in one of these neglected 
splitties when the oil-P warning light came on.  On average in that 
country, he'd have been a hundred mi or so from any garage; imagine 
his relief then on looking up to see one only 50 yd ahead.  He 
breathed a sigh of relief and no doubt murmured 'Nkrumah will never 
die'.  But the smile on his face quickly changed to a leer when, 
within the 50 yd, the engine seized.
	I conclude that when the oil-P warning light comes on, you 
should stamp  -  possibly even stomp  -   down the clutch pedal.
