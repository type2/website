&gt; Help - 79 Westy I bought doesn't have left tin cooling cover (looking from 
&gt; back of vehicle) - the flat piece that bolts from exhaust over to engine and 
&gt; covers the push rods.  I'm making one out of one of my wife's cookie sheets 
&gt; but would like to find an original - not a stock item at Bus Depot, etc. and 
&gt; no VWs located in local junkyards.

where are you located, I have a piece, not great shape but you can have it
fur nutting, come get it or postage, assuming I can find it in the black
hole known as my garage
