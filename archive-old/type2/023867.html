That's also the way I do it.  There are some that insist you affect the
valve clearance by turning the engine backwards, but I have not seen any ill
effects.

If you do it in reverse(the way the dealer taught me!) it is 1234!

My .02 1/2.

&gt;
&gt; Hello listies,
&gt; I adjusted my valves this morning however I noticed when I was done that
the
&gt; books distributor-cylinder order and the order of PADME's(71' Westy) where
&gt; different, only problem is I didn't notice until after I warmed her up and
&gt; readjusted the carb. I was wondering if this is common, and if so can I
&gt; continue or do I have to readjust the valves? either way I really don't
care
&gt; but if I do indeed have to readjust the valves how long do I need to wait
&gt; before I can do it due to the engine needing to cool?
&gt; Thank you all,
&gt; Scott Beaupied
&gt; PADME
