Yes!!,
        You can officially add to me to the list of over-the-top Type2 nuts now
(you know who you are)- I now have gone completely wacko (its a good
thing I'm still single :)... Introducing two new additions to my bus and
VW clan. Thanks to a tip from Jon Christensen a few months ago, on
Saturday I became the new owner of both a 61 doublecab and a 66 kombi.
        Air-cooled search and rescue story follows: Back in August during some
coorespondence with Jon Christensen he mentioned a doublecab in Iowa
that may have been close to me and that may be &quot;gotten reasonably&quot;. The
doublecab was located near Kansas City about ten years ago and had since
been moved to a farm in Iowa. After a couple of weeks I was able to
contact the owner. It turned out to be 30 miles from where I was! He
said sure, it's for sale..
        A week or so after this call - I went to the farm and found in the
woods, half-buried in mud to its axles a very straight, low rust, 1961
(June 23, 1961 to be exact) sealing wax red double-cab (painted a sort
of darker metallic maroon-red now). The pluses - all three gates (very
little rust spots, solid dog legs, very minor lower door rust, all glass
is present including headlight covers, nipple turn signals are there,
straight engine hatch, very straight nose, cut free dash with radio
block off plate. BTW 03369 is what the odometer says FWIW..
        The minuses - cut wheel wells (actually well done - if there is such a
thing - with symmetrical arches), no bumpers, no seats at all (but the
rear seat support frame is there), cab floor rust through, and rocker
panel rust through on both sides. Oh and no engine.. It did come with
parts in the pickup bed - shortblock 1600 in questionable shape,
assorted generators, fuel pumps, and carburetors, and an swingaxle from
a 67 bus as an extra.
        There was also a red and white 1966 Kombi in close proximity to the 61.
I found out it had been driven to its resting spot 5 years ago (because
of lack of &quot;power&quot; in the engine)- the usual rust present here- much
more than the 61 but lots of parts - the interior is walkthru with a
custom bed/mattress setup and stove/sink. It is still 6volts with the
engine in it, bumper mounted spare holder in front. A propane tank is
sitting underneath the stove and still has gas in it.
        I made a deal with the guy there - he has tons of vehicles and antiques
there (the only other VWs are a 70 bug, 84 rabbit and 78? Dasher). I got
the pair for $750.
        It was just this weekend though that everything came together. I spent
8 hours out there over two days fixing flats and pumping tires and
pulling the buses out of their muddy graves. Thanks to VW friends from
Des Moines with a full-size Chevy Van and a really heavy flatbed
trailer, we got the 61 Crewcab to my place on Saturday night- the
transmission on the Chevy was slipping from the load and it took 1 hour
to go the 30 miles! Because of this situation - my friend basically
backed out from moving the 66 Kombi on Sunday like we planned. I was
going to tow it on a dolly with my 81 Vanagon today but the back wheels
are locked (brake drum probably)- pulling it on a gravel road for half a
mile- and banging on the drums didn't work. I'll get back out to work on
it this week and try to move it then- the drums are soaking in liquid
wrench as I write..
        I am very excited - I had been sitting on my typing hands for months
now, trying not to blurt out everything until the deal was made. Now I
have enough projects to keep me busy for a while. Only half of my
vehicles are drivable now - the crewcab should be drivable with a few
months work next summer. My 65 deluxe will still continue to be a
long-term project - probably drivable though next summer as well (the
engine will be rebuilt by me this winter). I'll keep you updated as
things go on- I have lots of questions now. Oh and nice T-shirt Richard,
I wore the new Air- cooled search and rescue shirt on one trip out to
the farm...
