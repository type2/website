Subject: [T2] T2 - 1982 Vanagon 1588cc Air Cooled - Air Filter System -
  an other  final call  to arms

Thanks once more Tim Doktor.  Just to clarify:

I therefore have no direct link from the air housing to the carb', which I
should have.

&gt;That says to me the carb is getting unfiltered air. You must find the right

&gt;piece or fabricate something.  If it's not there, you can't hook it up.
Just be sure that any &gt;vac hose to it is plugged.

The hole is plugged but I'll double check.  The carb' gets no DIRECT link
from the air filter housing because this control valve on the carb isn't
there.  There is no other direct link possible.  All the other links to and
from the carb come via the vacuum unit on the ignition distributor and the
throttle damper.  The air to the inlet manifold is filtered and all holes on
the carb' are plugged or hosed.

&gt;This is a try it and see what happens deal. If it smooths the closing of 
&gt;the throttle it will help. If it doesn't, must block it off too until you 
&gt;find the parts to make it stock again. Without this function you may find 
&gt;that it want's to stumble and die every time you come to a stop unless you 
&gt;tap the throttle once or twice.

That's exactly what happens but in colder weather.

&gt;Resolve the issues as best you can then verify timing. Then set idle rpm,
then turn the 
&gt;mixture out 2 turns from it's seat, then in slowly till rpm falls, then out

&gt;to highest idle, then back in to rpm drop then out 1/4 turn and see if you 
&gt;have a clean, smooth idle that drops to very clean running off idle. All 
&gt;during these adjustments you must be resetting idle to spec until both idle

&gt;rpm and mixture are spec. It's an iterative process.The non filtered air is
the biggest danger &gt;here. A half mile jaunt down a dirt road could turn your
oil into an abrasive slurry in no 
&gt;time. Just don't be putting a lot of miles on it until you get filtered air
and verify 
&gt;mixture.

Not 100% on verifying the mixture but I kinda get where you're coming from.
The air going through the carb' is clean though so that's one less thing to
worry about.  I'll try to work through the last part and get back to you
once I've followed all your advice.
Many Thanks for your diligence

Rich
