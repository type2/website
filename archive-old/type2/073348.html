Subject: German Exhaust brands ??
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE REQUIRES APPROVAL

It seems I have a choice of Ernst,  Dansk,  or Leistrich as makers of a
stock style muffler
for my 68 1600 sp.  Are there any particular merits/ caveats amongst or
between the three?
My last &quot;German&quot; Muffler only went ~2 years before requiring &quot;open muffler
surgery&quot;
with the mig to repair loose baffles.........at 4.5 years now, baffles are
again loose, and the main can is rusted/cracked through in a couple of
places.
