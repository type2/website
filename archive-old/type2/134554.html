Subject: Re: [T2] Notes on using a voltmeter on my bus...

&gt; Now, I was wearing jeans and a long sleeved T-shirt, so my skin wasn't
&gt; touching anything... But apparently the current was able to pass
&gt; through my bumper, through my jeans, and to my hand that was holding
&gt; the lead.


No way. I'll eat a bus. I don't care how sensitive your instruments are, 12v 
dc is not enough potential. Not even your hand gripping the terminal holding 
the meter probe would do this.

I know electrons personally and they would never walk through that 
neighborhood. Some hang out after the dryer but that's it.
