Subject: Re: '70 Cold Weather Problem

Hey Now!

Many thanks to all who replied regarding my &quot;dragging&quot; engine when it's
cold out.  It was nearly unanimous that I should change my tranny oil
and put in some lower weight stuff.  Did that today and since we're in
for a warm spell here in CO (60-70 highs), I won't know the actual
results until it cools off again.  

I'm about due for an oil change in a couple weeks so at that time I plan
to do the compression and timing things as well. 

Thanks again for all the help - especially Bob (Veeduber) who provided
step by step idiot instructions for me that should get added to the Muir
book!

Mike
