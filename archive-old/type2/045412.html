&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; Does anyone have the specs for aligning the front wheels on a 1971 Westy.
My
&gt; bus is in the alignment shop and their computer doesn't go back that far.
If
&gt; anyone could let me know ASAP I would appreciate it very much as I would
&gt; like to get this done today. As always, TIA. TBear
&gt;
