Well I got the wheel cylinder on and upon inspection of the break shoes
I'll need to change them too.  Planned for this weekend.  Getting the
shoes today at lunch.  Hey maybe I'll change them tonight If the wife
will agree to me spending more time on the Bus.  Updated my sight
with photos of the work.

NO Brakes!!!

Thanks and Stay on the Bus....

Michael....
