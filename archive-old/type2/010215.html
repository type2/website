&gt; Hey Volks,
&gt; It took five guys to help me carry my type IV 1800 into the basement
&gt; and now that I am working on it, I have some questions about the
&gt; rusty
&gt; exhaust. 
&gt; 1) What does the EGR filter do? Does it help the engine run better?
&gt; Is it
&gt; good for the environment? What would happen if I just left it off?

The EGR valve bypasses a bit of exhaust gas into the intake when it is
opened.  This serves to lower the combustion temperature a bit and
reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOX).  This valve is
inoperative in the majority of early smog engines and they still run
fine.  The only functional harm you can cause is if the engine pings
from the slightly higher combustion temperatures.  Since the filters
are so expensive, many folks simply block off the system, installing
the filter only for smog inspections.

&gt; 2) My heat exchangers have some holes in them where they meet up with
&gt; the
&gt; exhaust pipes. Have any of you used exhaust tape for this? Other than
&gt; welding in new metal, what options do I have? 

I'd be leery of using exhaust tape, since the tape isn't really meant
for use near air that you will be breathing.  I've no idea of what the
tape will outgas, but any outgassing will soon be inside the bus where
you'll get quite a dose of it.  In addition, use of this tape will
encourage more corrosion.

I fix exchangers by brazing patches over the holes.  I use 16 ga mild
steel, which forms very easily to the desired shape.  If you or a buddy
have a torch, it's a very easy procedure to do, much easier than
welding the thin metal.  It's definitely desirable to save the OEM heat
exchangers, as it is difficult to find aftermarket exchangers that are
as good as original.

&gt; 3) My exhaust is pretty rusty, but other than the heat exchangers,
&gt; there are
&gt; no holes anywhere else. I want to take a wire brush and scrape all
&gt; the rust
&gt; off and paint my exhaust. I saw some paint at Wal-Mart that says it
&gt; is for
&gt; exhaust. It is supposed to withstand temps up to 1100 degrees. Have
&gt; any of
&gt; you used this before?

I've not had good luck with high-temp paint.  Any paint that can resist
the temperatures seems to have very little resistance to scratching or
wearing off.  There may be something better that I haven't run across,
but Wal-Mart barbeque paint isn't it!
