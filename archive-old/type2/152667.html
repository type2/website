Subject: Re: [T2] timing

You're absolutely right.  I will change it back.  I remember when I
first set this particular data tables up for the 72 thru 74 model year
- it was perhaps the most confusing and time consuming part of the
entire page.  And earlier today I wasn't thinkin' straight - got too
much on the mind right now.

Now as to why it's 10 degrees for that period of installation.  At
first glance it may be because of the vacuum advance two-way valve
cut-off, but in further reading of Bentley, this only applies to 72-73
Manual Trans models (72 models are 5 degrees AFTER TDC, the 73 Manual
10 degrees ATDC, so that doesn't make sense either).  This indicates
that there are truly differences between the 72 distributor and the 73
distributor as well as my spec tables showing the bigger differences
in the advance (as well as the retard curves) between the two.  Pure
speculation on my part, but VW may have changed the 73 distributor
(and timing spec) partly because of the valve and/or even the more
stringent emissions standards for the 73 model year - it's interesting
to note that in 74 they did away with the cut-off two-way vacuum valve
and still required the 10 degrees ATDC (depending if the engine was
1700 or 1800, Calif or Federal (etc.) and it gets real confusing in
that time period).  I guess VW and/or Bosch were REALLY pulling their
hair trying meet the emission standards for the time and were trying
every trick and combination that could be humanly conceived.

We still don't know what engine &amp; year Jason is using the distributor
(or even the distributor number for that matter).
