Subject: Help! ran out of gas and now bus won't start

checked for spark, have that, fuel pump runs while
cranking and manually pushing the flap open on AFM. 
My diagnosis is that fuel pump, althought running is
not actually pumping.  any other suggestions on the
cause before i order a new one.  any way of testing
old one?
