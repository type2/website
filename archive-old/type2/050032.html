[...]You may have the problem described a while ago on the vintagevw 
list.  As I understand it, the 009 has too limited a range of total 
advance.  So, to get the proper advance at speed, you are forced to set 
the advance at idle too high.  This cranks up the idle speed, so to 
compensate, you are forced to crank down on the carb idle adjustment too 
much, so now there is not enough air flow through the idle circuit.  It 
sounds like a vicious circle.  You need to get the proper dizzy in there.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; We have a 009 dizzy, put on by the PO.  
&gt; The stumble is very noticeable, complicating the issue.  :-(

&gt;&gt; Assuming you have what I think is the correct distributor for the year 
&gt;&gt; of your bus, this would be a dual (vac &amp; centrifugal) advance 
&gt;&gt; distributor, with a dual diaphragm vacuum can (advance and retard).  
&gt;&gt; It's possible that your vacuum can is bad and/or the breaker points 
&gt;&gt; mounting plate in the dizzy is sticking.  Also, a bad vacuum retard hose 
&gt;&gt; could be at fault.  My 71 has the same (or similar) dizzy  (on a 1600 dp 
&gt;&gt; engine), and a bad vacuum can was the cause for a similar problem I was 
&gt;&gt; having.  I replaced the can, and the engine behaved nicely after that.
