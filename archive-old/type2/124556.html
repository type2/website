Subject: Re: [T2] 76 Westy Deluxe kitchen light

76 thru 78 were fluorescents. 79 were 3 bulb lights, center bulb lite or ends lit.

Yes.... I have an extra fluorescent light .


From: Jason 

 Folks...
 
 I think I've concluded that my broken kitchen light is beyond repair.  
 Does anyone have a spare kitchen light for a 76 Westy Deluxe they would 
 be willing to sell or trade for?  I think the light is the same for all 
 76-79 US model Westfalias (I know the Canadian model is different), but 
 I'm not 100% certain.
