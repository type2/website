Subject: Re: [T2] Engine fire advice?

Strip it to long block configuration and CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN.

Check endplay, adjust valves. Do FULL service. Check clutch. Replace seals 
and gaskets. Grease the gland bearing.

Reassemble cooling and exhaust - painting as you go along.

I have done several engines this way with excellent results.

&gt;Recently I purchased a complete engine that had been in a fire for $50 at 
&gt;a local junk yard. The reason I bought it is because it is the correct 
&gt;engine for my 72 westy. My intention is to either rebuild it or even try 
&gt;to get it running. But before I do anything I was wondering if anyone has 
&gt;any &quot;does and don'ts&quot; on tackling such a project? The case seems to be 
&gt;solid (i.e. no apparent cracks).
