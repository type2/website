&gt;I believe the game you are referring to is Beetle Crazy Cup.  Lots of fun.
&gt;I have seen them at Target and Wal-Mart.
&gt; When in K-mart about 2 months ago, I saw a PC racing game that featured VW
&gt; busses as the vehicle of choice. I was poor that day so did not buy it.Now
I want one. Anybody know where to get one
