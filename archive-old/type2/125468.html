Subject: Bosch WR-1 low-voltage relay kit

It's time to upgrade my starter.  How much does the kit above go for?  Best
place to get/order it?

I could just build one from scratch, but it's too hot to think about doing
that today.  My AC compressor died last night and I can't get it fixed until
Monday.

Thanks.
