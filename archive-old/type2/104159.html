Subject: Cooked condensor

Any reason a condensor would cook? I'm helping a friend who has one. He's 
replaced it but I want to know why one could/would cook so we can correct 
any causes.

As an ex-Navy electrician I know loose connection = resistance = heat.

I also know that this could be a 6 volt condensor.

Other than that I can't see any reason a condensor would cook.

Does the color of the plastic on the end represent anything?

As I understand it a 12 volt condensor is a condensor is a condensor. That 
is 1 size fits all as long as the wiring works and it is 12 volts. Correct?
