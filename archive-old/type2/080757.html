Subject: Re:[T2] Those darn lights

Melissa,
    Not so long ago I too had a problem with no brake lights on our '71.
After checking fuses and wires, bulbs and sockets, it turned out that BOTH
brake light switches were bad.  If one goes bad the brake lights keep
working until the second one goes bad so I didn't have any advance warning.
I don't know if that would be any different if my little red, dashboard
brake warning light worked or not.
    You can check to see if this is the problem by putting a jumper across 2
of the terminals on each brake light switch.  If the brake lights come on
the switch is bad.  Now you ask, &quot;which 2 of the 3 terminals to put the
jumper on&quot;.....to be honest I don't remember for sure and don't have my
service manual handy.  You should be able to figure it out by looking at the
wiring schematic and then checking wire colors at the switches.  I think,
but not sure, it's the 2 terminals that are right across from each other.
