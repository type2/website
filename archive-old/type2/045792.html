Subject: Re: [T2] Any Listees in Frankfort?

I just came back from Frankfurt.  Notice the &quot;Polezei&quot; vanagons green and 
white, really cool.  Also there are these neat vanagon trucks.  If you have 
the time, take the train to Wolfsburg (east of Hanover) to the AutoStadt.  
They have the oldest known bug, the 1,000,000th bug, the one that made the 
bug more popular than the model T (15,xxx,xxx) and on and on...They have a 
great wall mural with a bunch of buses painted in their corporate delivery 
colors.   

I didn't see any 50-67 buses, but I saw a few of the loaf type and alot of 
vanagons.  They also have a couple of VW magazines there (in German).  Look 
at the big bookstores in the train stations.  One is called &quot;VW WOB&quot;.

Anyway....
