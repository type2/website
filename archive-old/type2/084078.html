Subject: Re: [T2] hydraulic lifter question

I replaced the 1800 in my 75 with a 2000 from a 78. I simply used the clutch
assembly from the 1800  and bolted it to the crank of the 2000. Sure some will
say I need the larger disk that normally goes with the 2000, but with my
experience hotrodding cars from fraud pintos to hand  built  drag racing
machines, I have seen smaller disks on more powerful engines. If I was taking my
bus down the drag strip I might be concerned, but as a daily driver I don't
think I should have any problems. I believe the flywheels from any of the
pancake engines are interchangeable. Wont swear that the 1700 is though so
please put that question to the list. I'm sure if its possible someone has done
it before. Also consider all those 300 hp type 1s that get all the hype in the
magazines. I'll bet their clutch assemblies are smaller than the one on your
1700.

&gt; Dear Bob and Tom,
&gt; Thanks for your replies.
&gt; Here is my reluctance to order the 2000cc engine.
&gt; I have been listening to the list and the recommendation seems to be that
&gt; this engine needs a larger clutch and dual carbs.
&gt; Now I will probably in the future replace my stock carb setup or go to dual
&gt; carbs, but there is nothing wrong with my present stock 73 clutch.
&gt; Will the 2000 be a direct drop in replacement on a 73 bus that originally
&gt; had the 1700cc engine?
&gt; If so, then I will surely take both of your advice and go for the 2000 with
&gt; the hyd. lifters.
&gt; Thanks for answering my questions. I want to do this job correctly the first
&gt; (and only) time.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I just finished rebuilding a 2000 for my 75 bus. I installed the hydraulic
&gt; lifters and am sure I will be quite happy with my decision. I have built
&gt; type 1 engines and various American made engines, some using solid and some
&gt; using hydraulic lifters. As long as either one is riding on the correct cam
&gt; for your
&gt; &gt; application, you won't find any difference in how the engine runs. The
&gt; only difference you will notice is you don't have to adjust them every 3000
&gt; miles for the life of the engine! The adjustment is not difficult, but why
&gt; spend the time when you don't have to if you go with the hydraulic lifters?
&gt; I also recommend
&gt; &gt; going with a 2000 instead of the 1800. Same money, less miles on the case,
&gt; and a little more power.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently deciding which engine configuration to get for my 73 bus.
&gt; I have decided to use AVP as the rebuilder.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am currently leaning toward the 1800cc engine,  but don't know how to
&gt; decide on the hydraulic v. solid lifter question. I have a Weber progressive
&gt; carb which my engine installer is going to rejet for the new engine and a
&gt; Mallory distributor. Everything else (trans, clutch) is stock and in good
&gt; working order.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any suggestions on the lifter question?
&gt; &gt; &gt; TIA,
