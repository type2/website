Subject: Re: [T2] fuse block info needed

[...]
the lack of markings of any type is what struck me when examining it 
with a very bright light to make sure there were not markings on it 
somewhere.  Was very confused at first when i started to suspect the 
problem but wiring definately matches the later year.  Just got through 
with digging in parts diagrams and listings and just realized that I 
have two variations of parts for the 1972 bus.  It  is now looking like 
the wiring diagrams are not going into model specific details.  With the 
same fuse block in the same year I can get three different combinations 
for emergency flasher, turn signal, and other relays.  The wiring 
diagram would look the same as the 73 on one of the variations.  This 
vehicle has seen time in Canada, US, and probably Italy as a PO was 
military and looks like he took the vehicle with him on his travels.

&gt; Is there a part number on the fuse box?
&gt; The 72 box should be 411 937 505C. [70 was A and 71 was B]
&gt; I am wondering how someone can fit a 73 box up above the headlight?
&gt; VW made the boxes bigger in 73 when they moved it down to the middle 
&gt; under the
&gt; dash. This coincided with the turnsignals moving up above the 
&gt; headlights.
&gt; I don't remember seeing any markings on the back of the boxes.
&gt;&gt; Was  assisting on a wiring call  and during troubleshooting  realized
&gt;&gt; that  i was looking at a  73 fuse panel and wiring patched into a 72
&gt;&gt; bus.  PO had also left a lot of wires hanging.  What i need is a chart
&gt;&gt; that shows me the terminal designations on the back side of the fuse
&gt;&gt; panel. In all of my tons of info here i cant locate a  simple picture 
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; show what terminal is what.  I can see no terminal designations marked
&gt;&gt; on the panel.  The fuse panel appeared to be relatively new and is
&gt;&gt; probably a  replacement fuse panel.
