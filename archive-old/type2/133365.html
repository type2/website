&gt; &gt;....get a good quality fire extinguser and put that in your bus tooo!....
&gt;
&gt; I've been wondering about this for a while, where is the &quot;best&quot; or not so
&gt; best place to have mount your fire extinguisher?????

mine is mounted horizontally on the seat mount right behind the drivers
seat.   since I almost always get in and out of my van thru the sliding
door I figured that is the most accessible but out of the way location if
I need to grab it on the way to the back of the bus.
