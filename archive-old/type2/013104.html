Most hypoid grease is 90 wt. until you get into the Catipillar and road
equipment lubricants.

Never add anything with TEFLON to your engine oil, it builds up under
your rings and causes them to wear out very quickly. That additive stuff
is mostly for people trying to hide problems when they sell an old dogged
out car.

Marvel Mystery oil is an old product but it is very good to run for a few
days before you change your oil (1/2 Pint to your crankcase).

&gt; I just changed out my tranny and am replacing the fluid.  Does anyone
&gt; know the proper gear oil to use?  GL4 is what Bently's says but does 
&gt; not
&gt; give a weight.  Also what is the difference between GL4 and GL5?
