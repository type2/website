Subject: California Model?

Howdy All --
I seen many references to California models and non-California (i.e.
&quot;Federal&quot; ??) models both on the list as well as in various online
aftermarket catalogs.  This has made me wonder just which incarnation my 79
Riviera is (especially if a part spec calls for one or the other).  The
emissions plate inside the driver's side door says that it passes all motor
vehicle emissions standards for 1979 vehicles (nothing about CA); however,
the number engraved on the engine begins with GE, which -- as I think I
recently read in an archive search -- identifies it as a CA model.  (Please
correct me if I'm wrong.)  It also has a catalytic converter centered in
the exhaust under the rear bumper.  Beyond these clues, can anyboby tell me
an easy way for me to determine if mine is a CA or non-CA model?  As
always, mucho TIA!
