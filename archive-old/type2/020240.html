Subject: Re: [T2] heater pipes revisted, please help
References: &lt;3A1B0BD6.F531A303_at_bu_dot_edu&gt; &lt;008c01c05433$2d553cc0$7807ff3f_at_b4l1q0&gt;

&gt; You are having a problem with the pipe between the heater box and flapper
&gt; valve, correct?
&gt; 
&gt; Your info on the year differences is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; 72 to 74 and 79 Fed version have ROUND holes in the heater box end and
&gt; corresponding ROUND tubes.
&gt; 
&gt; 75 to 78 have OVAL holes in the heater box end and OVAL pipes.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to use the 72 to 74 boxes on your 78, you need the 72-74 ROUND
&gt; pipes.

We kinda figured that out, except it looks from the fiche that the 72-74
tubes are a little longer with a different bend because they connect to
the front of the heater box, whereas the 75-on hook onto the top of the
heater box. Time to re-sort the inventory....
