volks

came in from church this morning and came inside, a little bit later my
daughter comes in and asks &quot;Why are my lights on&quot;????  looked out and my
right front turn signal is lite.

  go out and check and find everything is turned off, but the right front
turn signal is still on, nothing else???
 
  tried the 4 way flasher and it doesn't work, so it being over 90 degrees
I just loosened the bulb, but tommorrow I have to figure out whats up????

any hints where to look.

??? turn signal flasher relay???
