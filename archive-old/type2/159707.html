Subject: Re: Shifting problems- pilot bearing or clutch or trans?

I agree you can shift it through all gears without the clutch being 
released-if you don't want yto do it driving, jack up the rear SECURELY 
and run it through the gears, feeling your way in as you play with the 
gas (rpm's) to match the rotation of trans and engine.
If the pilot bearing is siezed, then putting it first before starting 
should result in it trying to lurch forward when running the starter, 
even if pedal is pushed in.  Other reasons could be what happened to me- 
the clutch disk lost its lining on the flywheel side and broke up, 
causing the lining to pack itself by centrifugal force between pressure 
plate and flywheel- so even pushing clutch in would have it act as if 
the pedal was not pushed in!  This began variably, with wierd lurching 
after normal clutching, say while waiting at a stoplight.
