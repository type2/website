Subject: L-Jetronic help needed

Anybody very familiar with how the fuel pump gets voltage on the L-Jetronic system?  I have a 1980 Westy that was running OK when I bought it a few weeks ago.  Well, it didn't start up cold very well; you had to push the accelerator while cranking (I think I now know why, I'll mention that soon).  Cranks but won't start since I installed new engine compartment gasket.  I'm thinking electrical - connector loose or broken, right?

I decide to get down and look at solenoid because I just bought it and was experiencing weak cranking.  VERY crusty.  Apply torque to nut with all of those crucial connections to clean them, and CRACK.  The whole bolt breaks out of the solenoid.  To keep this brief, I have installed a new starter/solenoid and replaced/crimped all new wire connectors to the solenoid terminals and installed the Bosch WR1 relay kit.  This is when I notice that a small ~20 gauge brown and blue wire is just hanging off of the old solenoid with a wire nut on the end.  It turns out that this is the wire that powers the cold start valve to squirt a little gas with cold engine.  I connect it with a new T1 connector and feel virtuous.  Now it cranks beautifully, and will fart once and then die.  I think this is because of that wire.  PO had told me that it was normal to push the accelerator pedal to start - I knew I was right on this one.

Here's what I've tried:

With the throttle valve open and the key in the &quot;ON&quot; position, the fuel pump does nada (maybe half a volt).  I've also tried bridging the two contacts of the TV connector to test whether it is mechanically bad.  While the starter is cranking, the fuel pump is receiving ~10 volts.  This is not enough according to Bentley.  But still, the first test bothers me.

The double relay.  I really want to understand this thing.  I've done the Bentley test where test light is used to show voltage during cranking.  All test OK.  Ground wire (85) is crusty, so I cleaned and tightened - even used alligator clip to attach to known good ground with no change.  I suspect that the relays might be the problem since it could have been damaged when I installed the seal, but can't fully test it without some help.  By the way, my relay looks different from every other photo I've seen (Bentley, Sean's tech articles, etc.).  Mine is one black plastic housing; most others look like two separate aluminum housings.

The fuel pump and filter seem OK, tank is full.  If you briefly attach battery voltage to pump, it whines away.  Ground problems seem unlikely because I ran a wire from negative contact of fuel pump to negative pole of battery without success.  Here's the confusing part:  if a helper supplies power from an external battery to the pump while cranking, it still doesn't start!

I've replaced and cleaned the ECU ground connectors and confirmed that when the fuel pump is pumping, fuel is going through the rail to the pressure regulator.  Don't have a pressure gauge, so I can't say if that is sufficient.

I haven't even camped in my bus yet!  Help me to look at this problem in a different way.

TIA,

John
