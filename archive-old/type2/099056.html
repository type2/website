Subject: Injector seals was Re: [Intake manifold gaskets/reality]

I used injector seals from Bus-Boys for my injectors. I was disappointed with the quality as one of the seals had a small tear in the rear. Does not effect the seal but this should not happen. Used it as I had no other choice.

Autozone wants $8 to order a set. I have also thought of getting them from California Imports or Bus Depot but I am not sure if the quality would be any better. For the good quality seals did you order them from a good foreign car parts store or VW?

Regards,

&gt; Also, I bought borg/warner injector seals for a few bucks per injector and the fit was poor. The o.e.m. ones are available for more like the 30 dollar range. They will last you another 25 years tho.
