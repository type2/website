&gt; &gt; Because of the relative rarity of good replacement parts in the Type 3

&gt; What?  If I read this correctly, Gonzo recommends that you twist the wires
&gt; together and shrink heat-shrink tubing over the twisted wires _without_
&gt; any other method of securing the wires!

if I'm soldering (usually I use crimp connectors) I prefer to use the
tried and true Western Union slice which is both strong and mechanically
secure and has no protruding edges to snag heat shrink tubing

&gt; Heat shrink tubing is for insulation, not mechancial security!

yup
