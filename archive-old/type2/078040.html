Sounds like your running short on fuel.

Pull the fuel line off at the engine side of the pump, and put the hose
into a coffee can.
Have someone turn on the ignition, and you will find out real quick if
you have a fuel from the pump / filter problem.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WHOA!!

Doing this ''test'' will lead you to THINK you have a pump/filter problem when
you DON'T!

The pump is NOT designed to run when you turn the key on. It only runs when you
are cranking the engine or the engine is running.

If it runs on YOUR bus with just the key on, YOU have a problem. Go back to the
Bentley, the answer will be there.
