&gt; I hate to beat a dead horse, but I just noticed something funky with my
&gt; tires.
&gt;
&gt; I put on Yakahama 356 tires awhile ago I was just going to rotate them
&gt; (back to front on the same side). I ordered four load range D tires.  I
&gt; just noticed that I have been ripped off, and they put on load range D on
&gt; the front and C on the back! I won't be able to take it in to get them to
&gt; give me the Ds that I paid for for a week or so, as I am going on roadtrip
&gt; tomorrow and have a lot to do before then.
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me that it would be better to have the Ds on the back, and the
&gt; C's in front, but I am concerned about the handling with the squishy tires
&gt; in front. Thoughts on this?

If the bus is handling OK now, leave it as is.  There probably isn't
enough difference to cause a problem.

However, you don't want the floppy tires on the back if you have a
choice.

Consider what happens when the bus gets a side load.
the floppy tires give a bit more than the others.  If the floppy tires are
on the back, the bus will tend to turn opposite the direction of the
force.  You will steer the other way to keep the bus straight, but now the
force goes the other way, so the bus will turn a bit too much and you'll
have to correct again.

I made this mistake before a 400 mile trip up the Owens Valley (crosswind
heaven).  I had 8 long hours of wrestling at the wheel to wonder why the
bus was suddenly darting back and forth with a mind of its own.  I swapped
the fronts and backs and the problem went away.


&gt; On a slightly more off topic note, I put two new tires on my wifes truck,
&gt; as she had tread separation on one of the old tires. It is front wheel
&gt; drive, but the tire guy insisted that the new tires must go on the back,
&gt; or the care will handle poorly. This doesn't jive with me, but what do I
&gt; know? Is the tire guy right or what?

A new tire is suspect until you run it for a while, so the old time wisdom
is to put new tires where they can do the least harm, on the rear axle.
Modern tires are much more reliable, so I put the new ones on the front,
only on the theory that most flats are in the rear and if I am going to
shred a tire I'd rather it be the most-worn one.
