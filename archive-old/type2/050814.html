Subject: [T2] I Need a New (Manual) Transmission!!!

Hi all:

Well, today my Vanagon started yelling at me, &quot;I NEED A NEW
TRANSMISSION!!&quot;  I'd been listening to it murmur about this for a year
or so, and I guess it got tired of being ignored and started to shout.

This car has been a daily driver for 20 years and I'd like to keep it
going for at least 10 more years.  Looking around on the internet I
found:
Strictly German Autowerks
A.A. Transaxle
The Bus Depot (Ranco Performance??)

Anybody have any strong opinion about the above group (or somebody I
missed) pro or con?

One thing I find a little off-putting is the &quot;12 month/12,000 mile&quot;
warranty.  Given the robustness of transmissions and the fact that
there's not as much that can go wrong with a &quot;do it yourself&quot;
installation (as opposed to engines, say) these warranties seem pretty
chintzy.

TIA.
