Subject: Re: [T2] Totally redesigned VW Westy - was Porsche 914 engines

&gt;As long as we're out here in never-neverland...An alloy body (Google
&gt;up Superform Aluminium UK) will get back that light as a feather
&gt;feeling... ;-)

Yeah, if we're going to dream - let's dream BIG!

Oh and while we're at it, let's do something about the driver looking out 
the top of the windows. Lower the seat or raise the roof or just change the 
proportions as a whole. I'd say a 5% grow in every direction ought to do it 
- wider, longer, taller, and a bit heavier. Who cares though? Now it's made 
out of aluminum.... &lt;grin&gt;
