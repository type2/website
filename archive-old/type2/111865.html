Subject: Re: [T2] looking for T2-microfiches

&gt; I do not recall the URL but for a while, someone in
&gt; the UK had the 
&gt; Type2 microfiche on line.

Yes, I remember that site too. It wasn't the actual
fiche but the parts book (it has only drawings in it
and no partnumbers) I think this page is offline, I
tried to look it up some time ago and couldn't find it
anymore.

However, there is a German guy (Michael Knappmann) who
has the entire partsbook on his page as well. The
description of the pages is in German but I think you
will find your way :-)
