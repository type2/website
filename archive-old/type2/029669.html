Imagine my surprise when I saw a hippie kid bus broken down just inside
the guard gate of our &quot;gated community&quot;.
They were some local kids heading to some deadhead sort of campout/show
right by the house here. They had probabky the rusties scariest 71 Ive
ever seen. I felt fortunate that I was able to get them started and on
their way with my phone# ,biz card and link to type2_dot_com considering the
problems are probably too numerous to count.
