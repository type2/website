Subject: Child Cot Bracket Orientation

I'm putting my '78 Champagne Edition Westy back together after the paint job
and can't quite remember how the child cot bracket and curtain snap were
oriented on the pillars behind the front door.   If those of you with a later
Westy could take a peek at these pics and tell me how yours is set up, I'd
greatly appreciate it. The bracket actually fits perfectly in both positions,
so it's hard to say which is right.

Also, I have two of the little plastic hooks you see below the bracket on that
pillar.  Where does the other one go?  I had pics of all this stuff as I took
it apart, but my kids thought it was their right to take my camera and erase
all my pics before I copied them to my PC.

Another thing I've noticed is that there is a slight difference in the
brackets themselves. Two have a bit of a flange that extends outward from the
base of the half-circle part (if you look at my pics, you'll see what I mean)
and the other two don't have the extra metal.  Which are the front brackets
and which are the rears?

Thanks!
