Subject: Re: [T2] gauge and carb questions

Will,

As I remember from my installation several months ago:

The Oil pressure gauge will peg if it isn't hooked up to the sender or
the sender isn't grounded.  It has to have the current path through the
sender to ground to read. I hope I'm remembering correctly.  I'll try to
find my install instructions.

On the CHT gauge, the + and - connections are for the red (+) and Black
(-) wires from the sender.  The sender generates it's own current based
on the heat it senses.  This is why VDO says to only use the wire that
they supply (which may be tight in length for a bus, my worked out okay,
but just barely).  Others have said that they added to the length on the
gauge end to make the run, but this may slightly slew your readings. 
The better the splice (strong mechanical bond, then soldered and good
insulation) the less effect on accuracy.  There is no need to hook it up
to external (12vdc) power, except to the separate light contact.  In
fact I think it would probably blow the gauge if you connected it to
anything but the sender as the operating current is VERY low.

Hopefully someone else can help you with the carb questions.  I'm not
quite &quot;there&quot; yet on my learning curve.

&gt; In hooking up my VDO oil pressure gauge, the needle pegs anytime it gets
&gt; +12V.  Is this a bad gauge?  I now have 2 that do this.  Has anyone else
&gt; experienced this?
&gt; 
&gt; I need help with the wiring of the CHT gauge as well.  There are only two
&gt; terminals on the gauge: + and - (not counting the light bulb).  I would
&gt; expect 4 terminals: +, -, and the two from the sender.  From the VDO sender
&gt; there are two wires.  Does the sender go in series? Which side?
