You could attribute 1/2-1&quot; of vacuum in a variance in timing.  More is not normal.

&gt;(and the engine would speed up and slow down as I watched the vac reading

I wish I could tell you what is normal sounding and what is not.  There is quite a lot of noise producesdaround the throttle body and the air distribution box.

&gt;and replaced ALL the small vac lines, some of the larger ones, clamped
&gt;all the larger vacuum tubes, removed and cleaned the throttle body and

Any hose that doesn't grip as you wiggle it on has hardened and is probably cracked inside and causing you a vacuum leak.  Be sure to check for cracks in the s-boot between the afm and the throttle body.

&gt;reattached it with Blue RTV around the gasket (some archive post
&gt;mentioned possible leaks here).  Gonna start 'er up tonight after the
&gt;gasket maker dries... hoping for good readings!

Steve Dolan once told me that 15&quot; is on the very low end of acceptible vacuum. I bet he would say not to run the engine for any length of time, especially drive it with a reading of 10&quot;.

At sea level I think a FI bus in great running condition (compression 135psi, new hoses, etc) should be able to read 18&quot;.  I have got it to read 17-17.5&quot; and I'm 600 ft. above sea level (vacuum drops 1&quot; for every 1000 ft. you are above sea level).
