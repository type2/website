Subject: Will VW's fly? Fluff

 A couple of the posts have dredged up another tale from the &quot;dark
side&quot;.

 On the USS Midway when it was recommissioned back in &quot;who cares&quot;,
we needed to test and adjust the steam catapult system after complete
overhaul.

 The catapult systen is the thingy that throws the airplanes off the 
bow and gives them initial impetus and motivation to fly away.

 The Navy started with dead weight packages of course.

 The first were junk yard Beetles and then we worked our way up to
some big Detroit Iron.

 Somewhere off the Bay of San Francisco there are a number of our
test shots. Maybe 20-30.

 Little side note: That was the meanest ship I was ever on.

 At one time the captain had the Morale officer evicted from the 
ship. Shot him off the catapult so hard it broke his neck. 
Yes he was in a plane. I don't know if it was an accident.

 I think it was the same cruise that the Chaplain went&quot;Over the Hill&quot;.

 That's a fact. The man packed his bags and walked off in the Phillipines.
Refused to go any further.

 It's alright if you guys think I'm a B.S. artist.

 I don't believe some of it myself. :-)
