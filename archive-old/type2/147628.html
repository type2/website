Subject: RE: What the kidsare doing nowadays.

My grandson  has loved my 71 bus ever since he can remember.  Now - aged 12, he is busily saving up for his own. - I declined to give him mine when he reaches driving age.  Couple of meltdowns (Starwars must-have toys) Mine is in Winnipeg now and Zander is in BC so he can't experiment with mine.  BC is bus heaven so am sure He'll get sorted before long. 

This drives his yuppy mother crazy because she has been trying to stop me driving mine for years and years.  &quot;A dangerous, unsafe far too old to be on the road bus&quot;. Really think she was embarrassed to have it parked outside her house.  Can't think how this happened to an Ontario farm kid.

Zander knows his Muir quite well. (8th birthday book)  Harry Potter and Artimus Fowl are about the only books that can stop him copying the drawings amd learning what the different parts do.  He badly  wants to find someone near with a bus so he can help with working on it.  

Sometimes wonder if my daughter will ever forgive me.

Ginny
