Subject: RE: [T2] Busaru running hot: Episode 2

I would strongly suspect a problem with a radiator... I'm pretty
sure that it isn't needed on our air cooled buses.

Take that motor back to the junkyard, I think they saw you
coming.. tell them you need one without a radiator to cool it off.

I put a pressure gauge on one of my bleeder valves and
started the engine (cold) and within 3 minutes had
10psi which was the max on the gauge. I shut down the
engine and then loosened the radiator cap to get a big
bunch of bubbles into the recovery tank.
