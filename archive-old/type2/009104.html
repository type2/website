	Chris, it IS going to make a difference in your engine's cooling :)
You see a lot of wierd things in the Berkeley area... a while ago I saw
a splitie with a L-channel and metal-mesh replacement for the engine
compartment door... I wonder how often they have to rebuild their engines,
and if they ever wonder why...

	Having put in the effort to get a replacement battery tray welded
into our '70 single cab, I wouldn't bother next time. Provided there are
solid horizontal pieces of metal left around the edges of the hole.

	Clean up the edges of the rust-out until you have solid, shiny, 
steel. Cut and fit a piece of steel, aluminum, plywood, fiberglas or
carbon-fiber-composite so that it covers the hole and overlaps the sound
metal by about 1 inch (3cm). I'd probably make the filler the approximate 
shape of the battery tray area in general, but you could just make something
that covers the hole. I'd also put the filler in ont top of the
original metal so that gravity is holding it together but you can 
put a filler underneath or use to that sandwich the original metal.

	Pick a nice size fastener, I'd use 1/4&quot; (6mm) bolts with nylon
stop nuts ('airnuts') and I'd use at least four, with as big a washer 
as I could fit on  both sides. The number of fasteners
depends on how much work you want to do, what the filler is made of
and the shape of the hole you're filling. Its difficult to imagine needing 
more than 10, even for plywood or fiberglas fillers. Some people would 
use pop rivets. 

	Clamp the filler in place and drill matching holes in filler plate 
and the  good metal  at the edge of the rust-out for the fasteners. Stick
a fastener in each hole as you go, unless you're using pop rivets in which
case use little bolts to clamp while drilling.. Select a drill size so that 
the  holes are large enough to allow primer and paint.   

	NOW prime and paint the shiny metal at the edges of the rust out,
and prime and paint the filler pannel if necessary. When the paint
is all cured, spread-on your choice of brushable seam sealer or RTV or
butyl rubber strips or flexable caulk (rain gutter caulk is butyl) where
the cover and body meet. (or cut a gasket from sheet rubber if you want-
the point is a waterproof and pretty-close to airtight seal).
	
	Glob some sealer onto the fasteners and install them. Drive
your bus.

	That sounds like a lot of work but having a replacement welded in
is even MORE work, since the welding will require cleanup before and
after, and primer and paint, besides the basic task of making the filler 
fit the hole and fastening it in. Welding a section of flat pannel to
the edges of a hole is NOT trivial welding. Overlaps that make it easy
are S.O.B.'s to clean, prime and paint.

	But no matter how you do it, you, and your bus, will be happier
if you fix that rusted-out battery tray. :)
