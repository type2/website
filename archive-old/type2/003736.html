I have a couple of project vans to dispose of

1. 1980 Westy.  Moderate rust and a few dents.  Engine would run but leaks
about a quart every hundred.  Has complete FI equipment but has non standard
exhaust system..ie..no catalytic converter.  I was driving it around when I
parked it and have taken a few parts off of it, including a tail light lens
and a turn signal.

2.1983 GL non- westy.  I took engine out to fix oil leak and have put it
back in, but not hooked up anything.  Has a single progressive weber carb
and all the parts to a complete exhaust system.  Ran fine up until I took
engine out.  Comes with a two person middle seat.  Body is in great
condition.  Doesn't seem ever to have been hit.  Just a few small dimples
and almost no rust.

Some one who would want to take both could have a lot of miscellaneous spare
parts.

I'm looking to get about $1000 for each of these.
