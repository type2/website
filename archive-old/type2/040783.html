Subject: My mechanic is stumped, and I am ready to cry!

Hello everyone, Beth in NJ here.  I am not very knowledgable about my
bus, but I am trying to learn, so bear with me.  My 78 bus started
bucking a lot when accelerating out of a stop a couple weeks ago.  Since
then my VW mech, who is trust implicitly, has tried the following:
changing the fuel filter, the air filter, putting in new points and
fixing a bad ground for the fuel injection system.  What happens is I
pick up the bus from the garage, drive home fine, then the next day it
starts all over again!  Once I get up into third or fourth gear all is
well, but the lower gears I feel like I am riding a bronco or something,
not my beloved bus!  It also seems to be worse when I turn a corner.  My
mechanic said he is going to consult his books tonight and his next
thought is to replace the airbox/air intake filter, but I know you guys
on the list know it all, so I figured I would throw this out for some
help.  Any experience would be VERY welcome.  Thanks!  Peace,love and
busses, Beth D.
