&gt; CV joints are cheap replacing em is a PITA, I always work under &quot;if in
&gt; doubt throw it out&quot; when it comes to CV joints

OTOH, during a poor period of life, I put a &quot;slightly pitted&quot; CV joint
back on the bus, promising to replace it when the $$$ came in.  It
outlasted two of the new joints I installed at the same time.  I carry a
new joint, but I don't replace them unless I have a good reason to do so.
