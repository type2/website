Subject: camper URLs

Distinguished Volkspersons:

Does anyone out there have a list of URLs with pics of 
different VW campers? I've never seen a Devon or a Sportsmobile
and would be interested in seeing a Highroof, Dormobile, 
American, etc.  I have a Westfalia, so I look at them every
day.  Still, a nice Westy would be worth a look.

Forever infatuated with campers for some strange reason,

Blake
'69 Westfalia

P.S.-- I am getting ready to have a pic of a splitty with a 
full-length camper top back from developing.  I will gladly 
snailmail a copy to anyone willing to upload it onto a site. 
(I got no power!)
