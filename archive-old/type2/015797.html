&gt;Dave, 
&gt;Please read page 104 of Muir 'vacuum advance distributors are a sop to 
&gt;american car buyers who
&gt;don't want to learn how to shift their VWs.'

I will repeat my assertion that the issue has nothing to do with shifting.
It has to do with &quot;flat spots&quot; due to an inadequate advance curve supplied
by the 009.  

&gt;I lump vacuum advance distributors in with Automatic transmissions and air 
&gt;conditioners, things VW did
&gt;to compete with American cars that made the owner do less and feel good. 
&gt;The reason I belabor 
&gt;this point is that it goes to the very crux
&gt;of everything we talk about here - do you lump your self in with 'american 
&gt;car buyers'  or with someone who loves and lives 
&gt;and feels his or her VW?  

I see no reason to make this into an &quot;Us vs. them&quot; argument.  The vacuum
advance distributor can stand on it's own merits as an improvement over the
older mechanical advance units, as engineered by VW.  As for other
ammenities, it's a free country so you can do what you like.  I choose to
have a bus that accelerates smoothly.  I also live in Texas, so I choose to
have air conditioning in my bus as well.  This does not mean that I do not
&quot;love, live, and feel&quot; my VW any less than you - I hope that's not what
you're implying.

&gt;If the former is true, you might spend $6,000 
&gt;making unnatural changes to a VW in the name of
&gt;american feel-good ammenities, like HEAT, etc.   

I don't consider heat a &quot;feel good&quot; amenity.  I consider it:

1.  A safety feature - keeps windows clear in the rain, keeps my hands warm
so I can hold onto the wheel, etc..

2.  A spousal feature.  You may not care but your wife/girlfriend may
refuse to ride with you if you don't have heat.  You wouldn't want to force
your beliefs on someone else, would you?  I'd rather ride with my S/O in my
climate-controlled bus than ride alone in my cold, damp but -hey no
compromises- bus.

3.  Just plain necessary.  I can't believe I'm even debating this.

&gt;I for one don't buy into any 
&gt;of that philosophy. In my opinion the 009 is more
&gt;stock than the vacuum advance distributor, and its the only concession I
make 
&gt;to customization. 

Are you going to also say that front drum brakes are superior to disks?
And that vacuum assist is frivolous?  I'm curious.
