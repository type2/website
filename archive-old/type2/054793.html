Subject: Correct Charging Voltage?

Sorry for all the questions, folks. But I'm getting bad info from my mechanic 
I think. Here goes. I just had a rebuilt Bosch 55amp alternator and a new 
solid state Hella regulator installed. But I'm worried that something is not 
right. In the daytime, my voltage is right around 14. But when I turn on the 
head-lights (low beam) it drops to just slightly over 13. If I run high 
beams, the heater blower and the windshield wipers at the same time it drops 
to 12, but the alt. light does not come on. What is the normal 
charging/running voltage for a ' 78 2.0L FI eng. with the 55amp. atl.? My 
mech says it should be over 14 volts regardless, but I seem to remember that 
with the type2's that this was not the case. Again, thanks.
Parker
