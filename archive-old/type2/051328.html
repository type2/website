Subject: [T2] RE: Clutch cable adjustment and cross shaft

Hi, I installed a new cable last night. It was frayed and stretched but your
idea is applicable to the problem nonetheless. I still have too much slack
in the cable and I think the bowden tube is the culprit. I do not have the
stiffner tube. That may be part of it. It is difficult to trust the manual.
It says you need 1 inch of pedal freeplay and 1 mm clearance between the
wing nut and the clutch lever arm (end of cross shaft, outside tranny
housing). To get 1 inch of pedal freeplay I would have to tighten the wing
nut until it was tensioning the clutch lever half an inch of rotation. I
suspect that my boden tube needs to be fiddled with. For now I will live
with too much pedal play but knowing that I am not loading my throwout
bearing.

Glad to see someone else is trying to run a Type 2 hereabouts!
Suggest you check
1. Bowden tube - does it have enough of a bend in it (an inch at least)add
washers if needed to increase the bend, and is the stiffener overlay tube
section (about 3 inches long) in the middle of the Bowden length.
2. The cable tube under the body  - is it firmly attached to the cross frame
where the Bowden tube fits on to it. If it can move, then the Bowden tube
will too.
