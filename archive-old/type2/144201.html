Subject: Re: [T2] Fan belt issues

&gt; The correct belt for a stock upright is a
&gt; Continental (conti-tech)
&gt; 905x9.5.  Accept no substitutes, carry a spare!

Yeah, that's what I have on there now.  It's
still too long though.  If I put even a single
shim, it won't tighten down at all.  The Gates
touted by the folks at the local buggy shop
Chirco as they best for all 12V vw's.  I have not
measured the Conti belt or the Gates.  I'll do
that later tonight.  

&gt; It might be that the pulley was not properly
&gt; tightened when the belt was
&gt; replaced.  Proper technique is to allow the
&gt; pulley and engine to turn as
&gt; you tighten the nut.  Otherwise, you risk
&gt; pinching the belt between the
&gt; pulley halves and having the pulley be loose
&gt; after the engine turns and
&gt; pulls the pinched belt out.

I guess I'm not following you.  I allow it to
turn a little.  Then tighten it down a smidge
(with a screwdriver wedged behind the back pulley
to keep it from moving), then turn it once or
twice, then repeat.  

&gt; I think that the stock pulleys are best, but I
&gt; do like the aftermarket
&gt; &quot;dress up&quot; alternator pulley nut and washer. 
&gt; The nut is a lot easier to
&gt; get a wrench on and it engages a lot more
&gt; threads than the stock nut.
&gt; 
&gt; If the stock belt ends up being too loose,
&gt; check the pulleys (did a PO
&gt; slip a &quot;power pulley&quot; on there?), the clamp on
&gt; the alternator stand, etc.

Pulley is 6.5 inches in diameter and appears
stock.  Is that a power pulley?  

Clamp on the alternator stand appears fine.  It
is tighten and in the right place.  

My alternator now seems to REALLY be making
noise.  I think it is already shot.  



Happy bussin'
