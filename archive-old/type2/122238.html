Subject: Webcam and lifters for sale

This is a standard grind for mechanical lifters, with gear.  Comes with
matched lifters.

I used this in a test engine for about 1 hour, so not brand new, but darn
close.

$100 and $15 shipping.  Paypal preferred. First person to pmail me at
vgonman_at_msn_dot_com gets it, and i will ship it today!
