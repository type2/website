&gt; Anyway here's the question: Would using a lower octane rating (economy 87)
&gt; cause a very faint, almost un-noticable pinging when the engine is under load
&gt; at higher RPM's (i.e. climbing a hill in 4th gear just before downshifting)? 
&gt; I have always thought that the higher octane rating gasoline was just a
&gt; money-making scam, but after having used the higher octane gas, It seems to
&gt; have erased this previously mentioned &quot;pinging&quot;. Am I mistaken, wishful
&gt; thinking, or is this probably true?

an absolute &quot;Maybe&quot;  as engines get used carbon deposits etc can change
the CR too,  I have found in my 2L that I really need to run 89 octane,
not all stations have that so I then mix 87 and 91 to get the higher
octane

YMMV
