&gt;Possibly loose wire, but I would suspect either a defective
&gt;light switch or a fuse that is heating in the holder and breaking
&gt;contact when it gets hot.

Dennis is a wise man.  I would bet on the switch, since I had the exact
same symptoms a couple of years ago.  I tested the switch and it was bad
(intermittently - how annoying).  Replaced it and haven't had a problem since.

There seem to be several varieties of headlight switches used in the 70's -
make sure you check that the contacts on the back are the same before you
pay for a replacement.
