&gt; tight i had to turn out the adjust ment screws several
&gt; times just to get my feeler gage in. Got them all
&gt; adjusted But it still pings pretty bad....the timing

well for a short term check, run a few tank fulls of high octane gas. you
may have carbon build up on the top of your pistons which increase the CR
and can cause pinging.  if it stops the problem then you are on your way
to solving the problem, and you can drive without damaging the engine
while you burn off the deposits if that is the problem.

if it doesn't stop the pinging then you know the problem lies elsewhere
and is not likely the CR.

cheap, quick test.
