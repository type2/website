&gt; I'm planning on moving to the coast and was wondering how this was going to
&gt; affect my 74 Westy.  What kind of changes am I going to have to make.  My
&gt; Westy has very little rust on it and is in very good shape so what do I do
&gt; to keep it that way?

Is it a general truth that gas tanks rust out more on the coast?

In the wetter climates a poor windshield seal would accelerate the rusting
process underneath.
