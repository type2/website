Search the Drag Racing Parts sites.
All AA Fuellers and Funny cars running nitromethane use hand held
altimeters to select their injector pump pill.
If I remember correctly thay were about $125.00 last time I bought one.
Short of that check with some pilot shops and aircraft instrument shops.
I've flown for a number of years and even expensive altimeters will have
varience, we have a Beach Barron and a Piper Warrior and sitting on the
field we get different readings on elevation, most commonly 30-40 feet.
The unit in the barron is a digital and the one in the piper is dial
face.
