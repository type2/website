Subject: top ten tools

 Actually I didn't laugh at any of Hoopers Tools. 

 I have them all and generally don't leave home without them.

 That does include the wood blocks, can't find a decent block anymore.

 Except the vise. :-)  My hammer is bigger than yours.

 There is one more I'm reminded of tho, or 2, baling wire and a coat
hanger.

 Only last week there was a guy in the hospital parking lot who locked
himself out.

 He even went in the hopital, they don't have hangers like that any 
more.

 I heard him ask someone else as I walked by.

 I went to my bug and was already rummaging in there when he got to 
me. 

 &quot;Wanta buy a coat hanger?&quot; I said. :-)

 Another success story.

 I even have wooden wedges. Make that last little adjustment or split
a case with no marks.

 You already know of my ropes and 2x4s.
