If you have access to a marine engine supply or heavy equipment supply you
can order a cable made up to your specs, and the price is usually
reasonable.  You might even find a &quot;universal&quot; choke cable on the shelf
that's long enough for a bus.

There are also options for the control end of the cable, including a control
that will lock at any position and can be adjusted in fine increments by
rotating the knob.  This type of knob/control is commonly used for marine
engines and stationary engines for throttle control.

FWIW.....

 &gt;&gt;  I have often thought of putting a choke cable in that I could open and
close as needed.  &lt;&lt;
