Subject: Re: [T2] First Timer's Engine Removal Question

&gt; I've got a 79' 2.0L Westy which needs a new clutch. I'm in the process of
&gt; dropping the engine now. My question is, are there some screws  underneath
&gt; the bus that hold the front engine tin (that goes from one side to the
&gt; other) to the motor? I've got all the screws I can see off the top and
&gt; bottom, and the damn thing stil won't come off. It feels like it's still
&gt; connected somewhere on the driver's side, but I can't tell for sure. If I
&gt; can get that off, I should be in the clear (right?). Anything else a first
&gt; timer like myself should pay close attention too?

This is all that come off:

The long rectangular piece is the heat shield and screws secure it to the
engine tin. There is a &quot;hidden&quot; screw in the center of the middle just
behind the rear valence that you may have forgotten.

The big piece at the &quot;back&quot; where the firewall is comes off with the engine,
like so:
