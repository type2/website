&gt; I'm using a VDO sender, maybe the light trigger is

i think you are fine, this is the answer.

the VDO sender triggers at about 11 psi, not 4-6 psi like the stock  
one. that is why i specified in my post about the stock switch. oil  
light with the stock switch on a new engine would make me worried.

yes, there is info about the light flicker being normal and it IS  
normal perhaps on a very hot day and coming down off a long high  
speed run. so long as the flicker disappears as soon as the engine  
speed increases the engine will not be hurt. i still don't like to  
see the oil light, ever, and it is 100% possible to build this  
tendency out of the engine.
