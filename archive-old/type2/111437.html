Subject: Re: [T2] my new bus

ahhh dan sorry bro joel is right one of the most important things to do is secure those fuel lines,...
and yes you did get a really really good deal with no rust and a engine that will at least crank for 300 bucks...
in my parts you cant hardly buy a used part for that for the bus,...
good luck and yes change those fuel lines...
very easy to do... just remember to take you some vise grips...
to clip off the line makes it a easier cleaner job and not much fuel or none at all on you..
peace &amp; have fun...

&gt;Dan,
&gt;
&gt;great news on your purchase. $300 for a rust free body alone is a good deal,
&gt;whether it's running or not.
&gt;
&gt;of course just do all the normal tune-up stuff, but one of the most 
&gt;important things is:
&gt;
&gt;CHECK YOUR FUEL LINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REPLACE IF NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;other tips:
&gt;-get a Bentley manual (official shop manual)
&gt;-check the brakes (including the flexi-hoses, which tend to swell/constrict with age)
&gt;-test other safely-related features like running lights, turn signals, etc.
&gt;
&gt;good luck &amp; welcome to the type2 community.
