Subject: RE: [T2] type IV valve cover orientation?

Not quite sure what that hole is for but my '77 has that on both. Of course 
this engine is far from original.

&gt;Howdy...working on my friend's 77, which is the first type IV I've worked
&gt;on in a loooonnnngggg time. Adjusting the valves - one cover has the
&gt;little dimple thing on the left side, the other on the right side. Which
&gt;is correct? Does it matter? What's the purpose of that little dimple and
&gt;the hole in the corner? Just wondering...thanks,
