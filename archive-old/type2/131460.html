Subject: Re: [T2] more...Re:Strange thoughts when bored at work...

I wouldn't say the Me's got spanked in any sense of the word...The kept up 
with the Spits and 'Stangs even at the end...

Now, water &amp; alcohol injection. I remember in my &quot;muscle car&quot; fan days 
reading about that... I see an easy way to get that into the airstream, but 
how would it be metered? Even assuming the water/alcohol mixture was perfect 
at a specific ratio throughout the RPM band (and that would be an adventure 
all by itself), how could we meter the amount into the air? Another carb? 
Maybe a remotely adjustable clamp on the hose that only allows x volume into 
a vacuum fitting?

While the concept sounds awesome (I'm all for anything to lower head temps), 
it seems like even more work than tuning my dual Solex's.

This is because ole Willy, Henkels and Folke Wolf hadn't figured out
supercharging yet--
That's why they got spanked real bad by
the P-51's, P-38's, and the Thunderbolts.

There was real poor maintenance or non back then--no parts, or personnel
to carry the work out--

Water injection would work well with an alcohol kicker in any Bus--
