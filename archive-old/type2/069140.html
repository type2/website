Subject: Tapping rocker

I have just installed a new 1641 engine into my 71 bus.  The engine was
rebuilt from the original case using all new internal parts.  I am now
having an interesting problem with the #3 exhaust valve on the engine.

I noticed that the valves were beginning to make a ticking noise.  Not to
unusual, I expected to have to adjust the valves shortly after installing
the engine.  When I got to the #3 exhuast valve, it was the only one that
was loose. I adjusted the valve and thought that all was fine.  Within 5
minutes, the valve began to tap again.  I checked the valve and sure enough
it was loose again.  All of the others were still just fine.  I adjusted the
valve again and again within 5 minutes of running it began to tap again.

I have done this several times and each time the valve begins to tap again.
I thought that I was just not getting the adjuster tight and that it was
working its self loose but each time I would check the adjuster and it had
not moved and was still plenty tight.  

I called the guy who built the motor for me and he told me that the push
rods are &quot;three piece&quot; push rods and that the push rod for valve might be
colapsing or might have a &quot;burr&quot; on the end of the push rod that could be
causing this problem.  What does this mean?  I thought that push rods were
solid. 

If anyone out there has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.  I
had to replace the last engine because of a burnt valve, I sure don't want
that to happen to this engine also.
