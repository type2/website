Subject: Re: [T2] Brake Failure Light Question

Change in brake performance could be an indicator of a looming problem.

Safety first! Figure out what is wrong with your brakes and fix them, now.

Simple things to observe for first: fluid loss anywhere - find out
where it's leaking and fix the problem. Check the wiring and
connections for the brake switches at the MC. Inspect, replace brake
booster vacuum line. Do the brakes pull when stop, drag when going, or
make strange noises?

When is the last time you adjusted your rear brakes? Without regular
adjustment you might notice your ability to stop decreasing over time.

It is possible that you are low on fluid, have you checked?? If you've
gotten low enough on fluid that it effects your braking performance
then you've got a leak somewhere, and now you've also got air in your
brake lines. Check you reservoir - if it's low, figure out why. Find
and fix the source of the leak - refill the system with (the correct)
fluid - bleed the entire system to remove any air you've introduced by
letting the reservoir run dry.

The problem could be nothing, or it could be serious. Until you know
for sure, assume the worst with brakes - your life and the lives of
those around you is at stake. That's no joke.

&gt; The brake failure light on my 73' just came on today. I also noticed that I
&gt; have to push the peddle in harder in order to get the bus to stop. The bus
&gt; still seems to brake fine, just not quite as good as before.
&gt;
&gt; Before I jump into this, does this sound like a major problem? Is is
&gt; possible I am just low on brake fluid? Have any of you had similar issues?
