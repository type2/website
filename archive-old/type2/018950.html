thanks to all who replied to my message..
Greg Schmidt actually solved my problem..thanks greg!
I went to Advance Auto Parts (who usually has nothing for my bus) and
asked them about rebuilt calipers.  They said 36.99 a piece plus the
37.00 core charge... so I said...TAKEN!  And I have to go in and order
them when I get some cash which should be real soon.  ( I do a website
for a band and get paid when I need it...neat huh?)  so Stella will have
new calipers within the next few days here

thanks again!
Isaiah
