Subject: Vacuum Help?

'78 2 L,  on the air intake box I have the large vacuum hose to the
canister but I also have a vacuum control that takes the very small
vacuum line.  It is missing and I cannot see where it should come from
and why it exists.

Help?

Sorry if this is vague or just a silly, maybe ignorant question but it
is bugging me.

I checked the online '78 manual and could find anything there.

TIA

Thomas Kulczynski
