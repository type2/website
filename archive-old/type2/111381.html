Subject: Re: [T2] dipstick for oil leaking partII

well i tried to puit a piece of hose around the end of the dipstick...
i am sure now that this is where the oil is comeing from..

it was still opened on the bottom of the hose and there is now oil all over the end of th4e hose and all over the alternator and all..
i got to come up with something to seal this off..
i always chacke oil before cranking always..
hasnt been long since got her back on the road and she is still running very rough for the momment the dreaded carb issues.. maybe i will have fixed this weekend...
i was thinking if i could come up with some sort of cork seal or rubber seal that was kinda like a washer for a bolt that would slide up on the end of the dipstick cover =ing the constant splatter comeing from the tube...?

surely someone has done soething about this in the past or present..?
any ideas..
thanks once again in advance..
peace
