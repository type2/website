Subject: South African buses and double cabs

Hi Volks,
     I'm looking at importing a bus from South Africa. It's a '70 double
cab pickup, and looks to be in good shape from the pictures the owner
has sent me.  I'm hoping the list can help me on two points. First,
one of the reasons that I'm looking for '70 is that my wife's bus is
a '70. We have a '72 sunroof that I'm probably going to sell, and I
would like to have my remaining buses the same year so I don't have
to look all over for different parts for the different buses (70-72
are so different in so many respects, it would make my life easier if
I had to keep just one spare parts pool).
     Does anybody know if the South African manufactured buses use the
same drums, brakes, and other body parts. Everything I can see looks
identical (except of course the SA bus us right hand drive).
     Second, the price I was given on shipping the bus from South Africa
to the east coast of the states was around $4,000. This puts the bus
way out of my price range. My budget is around $6000 for the whole
thing and shipping, and they are asking around $4300 for the bus. The
guy said he always just gets a container and puts the bus in it for
shipping. I hope cheaper shipping is available. If anybody has any
good (or bad) experiencs with international shippers, I would love
some info as I am clueless as to where to start. I'm in  Georgia, but
if I can get the bus to the anywhere on the eastern seaboard, I can
handle a longer land transport if it saves me money.
     Third, does anybody have a '70 double cab right hand drive bus in the
states they'd be willing to part with? I've always wanted a double
cab, and I've always wanted a RHD bus.


Thanks for your assistance,
