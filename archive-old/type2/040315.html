Hi there, One thing worth checking as far as the overheating goe's, is the
air intake at the back of the engine. I once made the mistake of keeping a
rag wedged beside my battery, for wiping my dipstick, the trouble is it
somehow made its way to the air intake at the rear of the engine! causing a
parcial blockage, thus causing overheating problems, the moral of the story
is *never* keep any type of rag in the engine compartment of your bus!

&gt; Hi all, , , , , , ,
&gt;
&gt; I have a few problems with my new '72 bus, and I thought you volks might
be
&gt; able to help me out here. . .
&gt;
&gt; 1. It ran very hot &amp; thanx to your inputs, here on the list, I installed
the
&gt; air seal between the engine and the body. That helped consisderably,
&gt; however, it STILL runs hot, but not as hot as before. What am I missing
here?
&gt;
&gt; 2. The brakes went squirley when I stepped on the brakes the other day
&gt; REALLY squirley, swerving left &amp; right! What's up with that?
&gt;
&gt; 3. I have a very loud clanking sound coming from the rear of the bus when
it
&gt; even crosses a small crack in the road. I can't identify it, but it sounds
it's very
&gt; loud, and sounds VERY expensive. Any hints on what to look for?
&gt;
&gt; I'm really looking forward to getting this puppy on the road, but I sure
don't
&gt; want to get stranded in the middle of the boonies somewhere,
&gt; ( And I LIVE it the boonies!)
&gt; The engine sounds very strong, other than a flat spot when you step on the
gas
&gt; from a stop sign. I can finesse that, however.
&gt;
&gt; Thanx for your inputs, ,
&gt;
&gt; Ron C.
