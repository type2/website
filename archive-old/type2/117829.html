Chris,

I can arrange for you to drive a new one if you will take me with you!

We just need to hop on a plane down to Brazil and walk in to a dealership
to try one out....remember that they are still making 1200 of them a month
and from the pics on the web, the interior looks mucho nice!

I am more than ready to go when you call me with the ticket #'s!&lt;grin&gt;

Maybe we can get a group tour up and then tour the factory there as
well...I would *love* to take movies of them installing lots of stuff(from
the how the hell did they do that files).  Especially the headliners!
Wonder how long it takes *them* to install a new front window?

Anyone up for a group tour to Brazil????

A quote
&quot;In a recent visit to Rio, Volkswagen's vice-president Josi Ignacio Lopez
Arriortza announced that it would locate its new factory of trucks and
buses in Resende. It represents an investment of $250 million. &quot;The new
Volkswagen factory signifies in the long run, a 5% increase in the state's
GNP,&quot; says


Cheers, dave

&gt; different a 200K mile, 25 year old vehicle is from it's younger self...
