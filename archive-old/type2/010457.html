Ken,
On page 66 of section 5 &quot;Engine and Clutch&quot; of the 68-79 Bentley for the bus,
figure 17-15 shows endplay being measured with a 'clock' while the flywheel is
*in place*.  Furthermore, it says &quot;To adjust endplay:  1.remove flywheel and
and reinstall it with only two shims.  2. measure endplay again....&quot;
When a mechanic i know 'field checked' the endplay on the 75 auto 1800 engine
i have, we did it with the torque converter mounting plate in place.

If you checked it with the flywheel *off* i'm sure you saw some serious play,
but it ain't real, man. It just ain't real. ;-)  You're engine is probably
fine.
