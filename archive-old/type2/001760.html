Don't know about the swing axle effect, but 3 out of the last 4 times that I
rotated tires I ended up with a noticeable to extremely bad radial pull that
necessitated at least one tire to be replaced.

&gt; &gt; ps: i run 60 lbs tire pressure all the way around and rotate every time
I
&gt; &gt; check the brakes (once) and remember the heat out here, very hard on
tires.
&gt; Hmm,
&gt;
&gt; Everything i've ever heard says dont rotate tires on swingaxle cars front
&gt; to rear.  Due to the geometry of the rear suspension the tires wear so
&gt; differently that its just a bad idea..
&gt;
&gt; Anyone else heard this?
