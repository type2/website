Subject: Congrats on the vredensteins

&gt;BTW the big letter on the sidewall is a 
C 

Correct.  It is part of the size &quot;185R14C&quot; and
means a commercial tire.  It has nothing to do
with load range C or D.  

but the fine print on the side wall says load
range D.  

Correct.  

The westy handles unbelievably better.  Turns far
easier, tracks far better, brakes better.  almost
like having a complete new suspension.

Congrats!!!  I am a hopeless cheapskate and never
put anything other than standard passenger tires
on my vans for years--and put up with the sloppy
wandering play on the front end.  It's the
difference between night and day when you put a
proper set of tires on there, isn't it? 

If you'll tell me how much you paid for the
tires, I'll post it on the tire page.

Peace and blessings, 
Nemo, the Bus Captain
