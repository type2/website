My old welding instructor is making up panels for both sides of my bus,
where the batteries (yep, plural) sat in the engine compartment.  I've got
the old rust completely cut out, pretty well prepped except for the rust at
the perimeter and the awful rust below in the outside skin of the corners.
He'll weld them in for me, but predicted doom and failure if there's any
rust there at all.  There is.  I can sandblast it out, but someday I'll
still have to replace the corners (I know, I know...but it isn't going to
happen now, and I want my bus back for the summer).  So...  he suggested
basically gluing the new panels in, reinforcing the perimeter with a shelf
angle if necessary.  He likes a two part mix, and I'm sorry, but I forget
the name.  Something like DuroBond.  Long set time, tough when dry.

Am I going to kick myself down the road REAL hard if I take this lazy route
now?  Someday, I'd like the bus to be repainted and pretty, but it's a
driver, not a show queen.  Suggestions welcome.
