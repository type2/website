Subject: 71 VW truck question

Does anyone out there either own a 71 VW pickup or know someone who does?  
I'm trying to figure out what kind of rear fenders I need to find to put my 
truck back to factory condition.

I'm still looking for a donor truck for bed parts.  I need some pieces to 
patch  mine.  Anyone have a lead?

Thanks.

Dave
