Subject: Re: Flywheel System Logic

&gt; Bob Hoover should be able to comment on this.  Twin engine planes with
&gt; contra-rotating props produce no &quot;left turning tendency&quot;,when you lift the
&gt; nose, the way a single does.  The props are like big gyros and the have the
&gt; gyroscopic effects that we are discussing.

Actually, this effect is not gyroscopic, but the effect of the downward
moving blade providing more thrust when the angle of attack of the plane is
high (and the angle of attack of the plane is effectively added to that of
the prop on that side, and subtracted on the other).  There probably is
some gyroscopic effect as well (old Howard Hughes could tell some stories --
he crashed a WWI French biplane because of this, but it had it whole
engine spinning -- prop was fixed to the case, crank attached to the plane).
Some aerobatic effects (like hammerhead turns) go only one way.

Flywheels like this can certainly cancel each other out, providing much
stress to their mountings.  What is scary is that there is a really
incredible amount of energy stored here.  Should one of the vehicles
be in a crash where the containment is breached, all of the energy would
be available to aid the destruction.  How would you like a 50lb. block of
plastic coming at you at 3700 miles per hour?

The protection of the flywheel is paramount on these designs, because of
their energy.  The European busses that use these are quite large, and the
&quot;bulletproof&quot; housing really are bulletproof.  The sheer size of the vehicles
is a good measure of protection along with the fact that they don't go too
fast in city traffic.

I, for one, feel a lot safer sitting on top of 12 gallons of gasoline (that
might be a problem in a wreck) than on top of a flywheel that certainly
would create interesting effects when released from its confines.
