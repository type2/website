Hi everyone.
I want to thank everyone for their help on my fuel pump woes.
After I installed the second pump, and couln't get it to work. I played
with the first pump and was 100% sure it was bad. Paid $50 for the second
pump, installed it, and it just heated up. No buzz. Nothing. So I was
mad, much cursing involved. Planned on buying a new one for $150, but I
was kinda mad so I waited. Went out 2 days later. I had the pump still
wired to the ignition. I turned the key and BUZZZZZ. I could hear it buzz
from the drivers seat. I waited a few seconds and heard the gas swishing
through the lines for the first time. Now I understand what Sean Bartnik
meant when he said
you'll *know* it when its working. :) You *know* it.
 So I wired everything back the way its supposed to be, turned the key and
she started on the first time!!!

 *dancing in glee all around my driveway*

What was wrong with the fuel pump? I have no idea. Must have just had some
dried gas in it from sitting (???). But it works now ;) Sometimes you just
gotta sleep on these things ;)

Thank you everyone for your help, you guys are the best.
