&gt; You can use a standard aftermarket Bosch 009 centrifugal advance
&gt; distributor in your '76 Westy. This distributor is under $50 new. The
&gt; advance curve is slightly different, but not enough to make any noticable

The 009 of course features a retard for number 3 as well I believe,
not terribly appropriate.  I will not argue that nearly any VW 
distributor will &quot;run&quot; nearly any VW, I just always figured might as
well keep stuff reasonably stock.  NOPI, Hoy Fox, and my local Advanced 
and Auto Zone all sell the late Bus rebuilt, some with &quot;lifetime&quot; 
warranties for $75-$125 depending on who and how fast and if you need a 
core. Check out NOPI and Hoy Fox in the aircooled mags.
Could be worse after all, could have injection points like the 914
or the T3.  Those distributors and the points are getting ludicrous.
