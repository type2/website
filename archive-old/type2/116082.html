&gt; Has anybody got any feedback on this Bug Me Vid of a teardown and rebuild of
&gt; a type 4 with Jake Raby? I just bought one and wanted to know if there was
&gt; any misinfo on it before commiting it to memory as law. I know Jake is known
&gt; for his engine building prowess but you never know.

Certainly no misinformation. Any &quot;how-to&quot; will always have things left out,
but that video is pretty complete. It is really long, for one thing, so they
cover a lot of ground. I have referred back to it several times for little
procedures, for instance the one on distributor indexing is very good, as is
the one on indexing a bolt-on cam gear to the cam.
