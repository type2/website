Hiya Rae,

Hoo Boy!  My area of experience!  You WILL have to remove the lock/latch 
assembly from the door.  This can only be accomplished by going at the 
assembly from the inside (gotta remove the door panels).  And you'll have to 
get the rear channel guide (for the window) out of there which can be a real 
bear.  In any event, just follow the step-by-step listed in your Bentley.  
While you're at it, remove the handle from the inside too.  
When you have the lock/latch asssembly (it's a complicated little piece of 
machinery) out just play with it for awhile and see how it works.  It should 
become evident to you in just a little bit.  Hey!  I figured it out in a 
half-hour and I'm no mechanical Einstein.  Once you have it figured out 
you'll probably be able to adjust it to work.  I just did a little filing on 
mine and presto!................working lock.
Clean it and lube it up (do the outside handle too) and you are ready to go.  
If you run into problems, zap me an e-mail and I'll see if I can talk you 
down.
By the way, I have a question for you..............How do you get into your 
Bus anyway?

Lotsa luck!

Mike
