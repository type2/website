Well I finally did it.

I insulated the long heat delivery tube and fixed all
of my air leaks.  Id say conservatively the air volume
increased 100%. 

I turned the fan on and used my hand to find the leaks.
I had big leaks at the air valves.  The rear covers
were loose, and I think they were only originally spot
welded. That accounted for half the lost air.  Varous
leaks around the exchangers, and a busted tube to the
bench seat outlet were also concerns.

I also had again one of teh fan feed tube half off. 
This time I put a single spot of silicone on the flange
and then tightened the clam over it.

To test out this winter, I also rigged up a return into
the defroster fan through the top engine hatch.  I cut
apiece of plywood and fastened it in place of the hatch
and put a hole though it for the tubing.  Then I
created a &quot;table&quot; with 2&quot; legs so that all the stuff
behind the rear seat looks stock.  Its just 2&quot; higher. 
The air return feed comes under the &quot;table&quot; benihd the
rear bench.  My issue with the return feed is that it
will reduce the air flow volume, SO Im glad its not
permanent changeover (just incase)

The last part is to seal the Jalousie windows more
permantently, since they really really air leak bad.

So far im into this only about 3 hours, and it has all
been really easy work.

And since Im in Saskatchewan, I expect that I should be
able to determine just how cold I can drive it with
these mods.

It supposed to be around 3C (38F) on Tuesday morning,
so I'll let you know how it goes.

If they work out well, I'll make them more permanent
next year. (Replace my 3m duct tape with screws)!
