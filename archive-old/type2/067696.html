This is not correct.  The modern laser-plus-computer alignment tools allows
the shop to employ techs having lower skill levels -- at lower wages.  The
accuracy of the final alignment remains a function of the man doing the work.

The front suspension of a Volkswagen bus is not a Swiss watch, it is part of
a light truck.  You can do a perfectly adequate alignment using surprisingly
simple tools.  The only major difference between doing the job yourself and
having it done for you is that you'll take longer and cost considerably less.
 

And for those who feel the investment in alignment tools is wasted, Brandy's
case offers an excellent lesson -- Most alignment shops do not have the
proper tools for working on Volkswagen buses.
