Subject: Re: [T2] pit thoughts

I was dreaming one day about a perfect aircooled VW garage. I decided that
it would have a &quot;shelf&quot; floor.

The shelf garage would have one large surface, big enough to hold a Bus,
that has a garage door at one end. At the end opposite from the door, the
floor would be maybe two and a half feet lower, and there'd be a notch in
the raised-up floor where a hydraulic lift table (Harbor Freight has them)
would fit in. The edge of the raised-up floor would have a lip so the
vehicle wouldn't roll into the lowered area. Use small rolling platform
ladders like they have at home stores to get up into the Bus, if necessary.

If you want to pull the engine from a Bus, roll the Bus back so the engine's
hanging out over the lowered area, put in the lift table, jack it up to
contact the bottom of the engine, unbolt the engine, lower it and wheel it
away into the workroom that's down there.
