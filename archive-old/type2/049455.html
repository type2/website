Subject: Bus fires - extinguishers at Costco

With all the talk of bus fires and the one in San Diego I noticed a two pack
of fire extinguishers at Costco here in N. CA. for $16 . At first I passed
them up, but reason prevailed ($15 vs. $3000) hmmmmmmm. Also a 300 watt
inverter for $35 and a $5 mail in rebate. So far it is working well for Xmas
lights in my wife's Subaru.
