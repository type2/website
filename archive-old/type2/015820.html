&gt;A PO had installed an oil temp sensor in a tee arrangement off the top of

	John,

	This is not the best location, you will get much too low readings. Oil
doesn't transfere heat very good and the T junction will not heat up as
much as the oil. The tip of the sender should be in the oil flow (without
restricting it). An acceptable location is in the sump plate. 
	I'm not too familiar with the pancace engine but in the type1 engine the
oil filtering screen has a thin aluminun bottom. Drilling the sender tip
trough this gives a noticeable difference in temp reading. That's just
because the oil sucked into the pump is passing by the sender. The oil
between the filtering screens aluminum bottom and the sump plate doesn't
circulate much.
	On my type1 engine I have an external oil cooler and a filter. With this
setup I can have a T junction on the oil hoses. The juction has to be
grounded with a extra wire to work.This junction is originally made for use
in air pressure sytems. I had a plummer thread the junction for the temp
sender and now the senders tip is in the oil flow before the filter and the
cooler. I have been thinking of putting another one in behind the external
cooler to see how the cooler performes but so far a &quot;paranoia alert&quot; in the
back of my brain has stopped me:-) 

Don't forget to check the archives on this one. This thread comes up every
year when the sun has gone down after the first hot spring day:-)

Hope this helped you a little....
