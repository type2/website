Subject: RE: [T2] propane

&gt; I am trying to research where and how
&gt; much I can get an external propane tank for my 76 westfalia in
&gt; anticipation for a trip to Utah later this month. I checked the archives,
but
&gt; other than a site in Italian, I didn't have much luck. Can someone advise?
I am in
&gt; northern ca, 5 minutes away from SF, but online ordering is fine as well.


I sell new, original-equipment propane tanks for Vanagon Westfalia campers
for $219.95.  This tank is significantly larger than the one that was
optional on the Westy buses.  You might have to fabricate a mounting bracket
but it could be used on a bus.  They are currently out of stock but I have
some coming in about 2 weeks.
