Subject: Bus ancestry - the dymaxion car?

OK, it's Friday and I figured maybe nobody would mind if I brought up a
low-VW-content topic. Besides, after this weeks long philosophical
questions about the dimples on golf balls, I thought I could be
forgiven.

Here's my question for you VW historians out there: where did VW come up
with the idea for the VW transporter? I can't seem to remember seeing
any vehicles that were anything like it but earlier. Except for...

Buckminster Fuller's dymaxion car. This has become my automotive
obsession. Back in the early thirties, the guy who gave us the geodesic
dome designed a car that could carry eight adults, cruise at 140 mph,
and get 30 miles per gallon. He actually built several working
prototypes. The dymaxion car looks like a cross between a VW and a DC-3.
Imagine stretching out a split-window bus into more a teardrop shape.
The engine was in the back, where it drove a single, large wheel (It was
a three wheeler.). The rear wheel also was the steering wheel; it could
actually turn completely sideways, allowing the car to spin in circles
while the nose stayed in the same place.

I've only seen pictures of the dymaxion car, though there are a few in
museums around the country. I'm dying to see the interior of one.

The reason I bring this up is because the dymaxion car was totally
unlike any car that existed at the time. Is it possible that the VW
engineers were tyring to achieve a slightly more conservative
interpretation of the dymaxion car? I thought maybe some folks on the
list might have seen info on VW's inspiration for the transporter.
