Subject: Re: [T2] Crane XR700 ignition

Originally known as the Allison XR700 before Crane Cams bought them, I have
used these on numerous VWs (and a few T*y*t*s as well,) over the past 30
years or so. Like Eron says, a true CDI with an optical trigger, rather than
a magnetic hall, and in my opinion it's the best &quot;pointless&quot; system ever
produced. Optical triggers aren't affected by dirt, dust and moisture like
hall units can be. Why do most other manufacturers and the OEMs use Halls?
They're cheep, need I say more?
 Allison was originally located in Duarte, CA near the City of Hope, close
to where I grew up in Glendora (man was that a long time ago). Allison
originally offered a lifetime warranty on their XR700's (never did have to
take them up on it though). After Crane bought them they changed the
warranty to something like 5 years or so (aw, boo). I don't know if Crane
ever had to &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; any defectives after the buy-out.
 When I get them outa the &quot;restoration barn&quot;, both my Ghia and 411 Wagen
will each receive a XR700 unit.

&gt; I have one of these things kicking around and was thinking it would go
&gt; nicely in my 77 Westy Camper Van, but I don't know much about them. Are
they
&gt; any good? How do they compare to a Pertronix or Compufire??
