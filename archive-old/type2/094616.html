Hey all,

As I can't sleep, I thought I  would ask two questions:
1) Is there such a thing as a 'trigger' for reverse available for my 1978=
 Bus? (On my 1973 VW Beetle, I had a EMPI or Hurst; [I forget] stick shif=
t; it had a trigger for reverse that made going into that gear so much ea=
sier)...
2) And is there such a thing as a five speed, and if so, how easy to put =
in ? (I have this friend who has a 1980 Datsun Sentra wagon [I think that=
 is the year] who had his reverse blow out on him, so the mechanic offere=
d to put in a five speed and he has been happy ever since)

I don't know if either is possible. Just had to ask.
