Subject: Westy and parts for sale

I really don't want to see it go, but I have to sell my bus.
It is a 79 westy with FI and an automatic tranny.
It has a new pop top canvas and the fridge, stove, outlet and sink all work. 
(The sink leaks a little at the pump and the pump is loud, but it works and 
I have an extra pump.)
The beds are both in decent shape.  Has all cabinets, but no stool or 
tables.
The engine was rebuilt a couple years ago.
It runs, but loudly.  The common opinion seems to be that it is a burnt 
valve, but I don't know enough about engine sounds to say for sure.  You are 
welcome to call or stop by and listen to it.
This was probably caused by damage done to the muffler (it isn't in very 
good shape)
I also have another 2.0 engine from a 78.  It is frozen, which may or may 
not be from sitting in a field for a few years, but I couldn't get it to 
turn over after using marvel and liquid wrench.  It has the heater boxes and 
muffler still attached.  It was set up for FI.
I also have what i think is a 1700 or 1800 (I think it may have been from a 
77, but can't remember).
My friend I got it from said he was running it in his bus a while ago while 
he rebuilt his 2.1.  It has since sat in a field and is frozen, but I 
haven't tried at all to unfreeze it. It has a weber single progressive carb 
on it, which I know nothing about.
I also have a spare auto tranny from a 79 that is good for parts.
I also have 2 manual trannys that are good for parts.
I have various FI parts including an extra brain and air sensor.
I have 2 extra gauge clusters. ( one from a 78 and the other from a 74?76? 
it has silver on the gauges)
I have a bunch of other parts that I can't think of now also. I may still 
have access to 2 parts buses (a 78 and a 74 or 76) but I haven't checked in 
a while.
You are welcome to camp, work on it, or store it at my place short term if 
you need to.
I am located in Pittsboro/Chapel Hill, NC
Make me an offer on all or some of it.
Will also do partial trade for work on a volvo
I've got to sell it asap.
Thank you all very much,
Kyle La Ferriere
Pittsboro, NC
