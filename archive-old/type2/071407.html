Hi All,

Well, I received a wake up call two weeks ago, after ignoring the dash
warning light for the master cylinder on Alice, my '71 deluxe, for about
a week. 

No excuses. I knew that I was stopping with only half a brake system.
Unfortunately hit a patch of wet and oily pavement and slid lightly into
the rear of an old pickup. Nobody hurt, didn't even exchange names, but
Alice (who was ready anyway, for some serious shop time for minor
bodywork, new engine and trans) now has a 3-4&quot; overbite. 

After spending some time  pulling her nose out yesterday, I realized
that between the work done before me and the complexity of the dents,
Alice would be better off with a new nose. 

Ron Salmon lists new sheet metal &quot;from the windows down&quot; for $139 on his
web site. Has anyone had experience with front metal from him ? Are
there any web sites or folks with photos of this procedure ?

If I undertake this procedure, is there anyone who would be willing to
host photos on a web site ?  Stephen G. ?

The nose that is available is for the 72 and up years. The turn signals are 
up high beside the air inlet grill. The piece does not go down far enough, so 
have to also put on the available lower nose skin (68-71) to make it 
complete. To make it work for a 71, and have it look like a 71 is a huge job 
of cutting and welding. Also the peice has an ugly bump on the front that 
sticks out for the VW emblem as these are really replacement parts for 
brazillian busses.

All that said, I had it done for my 71 by the Metal Wizard (Metwiz2_at_aol_dot_com) 
and it looks nice. He does great work, but anyplace else would prolly not 
even take it on. Prepare to spend the shop rate for a lot of work.

My friend just had a similar problem with a tree and he was able to find a 
complete nose for a 71 at a swap meet for 65.00. He said a list member 
offered him one for 400.00.

Write Kelly Brown (Metwiz2_at_aol_dot_com) and ask him about the job.

Good luck,
