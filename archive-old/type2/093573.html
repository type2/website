Thanks.

&gt;  The 3 piece windshield repair you were/are looking for can be made by any
&gt;metal fab shop for less money then Schofields.

What's a good price for this item? Schofield want $39US.  Can I really get parts and labour for less than this?

&gt;  There are good and fair pieces made by many companies and I would suggest
&gt;talking to someone www.metwiz_dot_com that has pretty much tried EVERYONE'S
&gt;metal repair pieces and can tell you who has the best.

Metwiz sells a repair part but only for splits. I'll ask then what they have to say. FYI...

http://www.metwiz_dot_com/parts/002_0220.jp

&gt;  There are also a lot of independents here in the U S that are also making
&gt;repair parts.

Can you recommend any?
