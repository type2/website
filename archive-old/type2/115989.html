&gt; Greetings List,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm getting ready to put all the windows back in the bus and I'm trying to
&gt; decide what, if anything, to seal things up with.
&gt; 
&gt; The guy that I just bought my windsheild from said to use silicone spray.
&gt; And that &quot;as the silicone dries it forms a bond between the body and the
&gt; seal.&quot;  Hmmm, seems fishy.

I don't think that would be the best course.  The compound used by my glass
man was a urethane compound that came out like dark black axle grease and is
really messy stuff.  Before it sets it oozes in and fills all the dead space
in your seal and It sets up great.  Also on the same note I used a gasket
for the windshield from West Coast Metrics &amp; I haven't had any problems for
about 7 years so far.
