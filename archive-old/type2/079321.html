Subject: Re: [T2] Leaky pushrod tubes


Joel,

There was one thing &quot;left out&quot; of the procedure....when I did mine, I
expected to be able to just push the tubes back in to the holes.


No way!  I tried everything, but the angle and depth that you are working
at makes it difficult.  I found a socket that i tested to clear the walls
on the head, but still provide a godd surface to the push rod tube.

I then used a few light taps of a rubber mallet on the socket with a long
extension to get them back in....they are very tight.....they have not
leaked a bit since then.

Cheers, dave

&gt; Scott,

&gt; Mr. Bartnik has been kind enough to provide an excellent article for this
&gt; procedure in the library. check it out at http://type2_dot_com/bartnik/pushrod.htm
&gt; 
&gt; its really quite easy.
&gt; 
&gt; the only thing i can add is to make sure you do this with a COLD engine.
&gt; the rocker arms &amp; pushrods can get very hot. (ask me how i know)
&gt; 
&gt; good luck,
