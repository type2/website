Howdy y'all. On Saturday I went with the wife and kids to Julian, CA (not
in the '66 Kombi, however). For those that haven't been there, it's a
little town in the mountains near San Diego, elevation approx. 4500 feet.
It's a decent place to visit on the way to somewhere else, such as the
desert, but there's a few too many &quot;country crafts&quot; stores for my taste.
Julian is famous for its pies made from apples and other fruits grown in
the local orchards. One store, known as the Julian Pie Company, has an
old-fashioned delivery wagon that they drive around town as an advertising
ploy. Saturday it was parked in front of the store, so I got a chance to
look at it. &quot;Hey, that lug nut pattern looks familiar&quot;, I said to myself.
Hmm. So did the steering wheel, and pedals, and heater controls! Finally, I
had to look underneath, and there was a valve cover staring right back at
me. The Julian Pie Company wagon is a split-window non-walkthrough
conversion van! The wagon has flat plywood sides and roof, with an open
front that sort of looks like one of those old cars from the 1890's or
something (glass that only comes up halfway to the roofline above a curved
front), and an oval window in the back. I don't think they really carry
pies in it, but it was neat nonetheless, and gave me ideas in case my '66
Kombi project doesn't work out ;-). I didn't get any more info from the
people inside. I guess I was afraid to find out that it was originally a
'56 Crew Cab or '52 23-window deluxe or something :I.
