Subject: Re: [T2] WTF?   Japanese site

manuals to old Japanese model cars I used to try to put together...
&quot;(Possession) Higuchi store way over  rider (classic) Ota way over 
rider (D ground U)
Item headlight + plated foil cap  wrapping paint + seat cover + plated 
foil cap + emblem of wrapping  paint + outside
Interior paint + lining re-covering + sun light/write visor + tail  
lens cap&quot;

corporation.
The full order which pursues your originality is possible.&quot;

I want one.

&gt; Altavista has a gadget called Babelfish which can translate the

&gt; &lt;grin&gt;).
