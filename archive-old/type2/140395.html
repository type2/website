Subject: RE: [T2] Re; Parcel Trays

&gt; They never touch your shins, nowhere near. Not the stock 
&gt; ones, and I have seen the aftermarket plastic one from Just 
&gt; Kampers and it is the same size as the stock ones, so they 
&gt; are fine also.


Incidentally the Just Kampers one is the one we sell ... One of our most
popular items, a lot more functional than the original (or repro) and a
fraction of the price as well...
