&gt;&gt;I'd be very interested in getting a rear hatch latch.  Is is possible to
&gt;&gt;get the tumbler keyed to the current locks on my bus?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My '74 came with a locking engine hatch. The key is the same as the 
&gt;&gt;doors. I
&gt;&gt;assumed it was original, but really have no idea.... It is nice to be 
&gt;&gt;able
&gt;============================&gt;
&gt;My locking hatch latch is stock and tumblered the same as all other 
&gt;locks and ignition on NewBus.
&gt;
&gt;For Casper, the latch was a later find at Seattle last year ($15.00).
&gt;Steve Sandlin tumblered it to the same key as the rest of 
&gt;Casper's  for me.
&gt;Took Steve about 10 minutes, and not much money out of my beer budget 
&gt;to get it done for me.
