Subject: Re: Fw: [T2] new factory 1600DP motors??

Someday, it's going to get to the point of just rebuilding existing engines
because production of the &quot;old school&quot; Beetle in Puebla, Mexico ceased
within the last year and I don't know of any VW factory still producing the
model (maybe Brazil? Dunno myself).

&gt; On re-reading I notice there is no date for the impending demise of the
&gt; old
&gt; boxer motor.
&gt; Anyone know any more info? Are they just not using them in a vehicle
&gt; anymore, or are they stopping production all together which would mean our
&gt; only option for a new motor would be to re-build?
