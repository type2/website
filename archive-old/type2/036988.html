&gt;&gt;His catalogue is online.  Just point the browser to www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk

&gt;YOU CAN BUY A WINDSHIELD REPAIR PANEL IN ENGLAND.

&gt;astounding what is available over there, particularly the darn windshield
&gt;frame
&gt;repair piece for 25 pounds, what like $50 or so?

Multiply by 1.62 last I checked, so like $40.50 and they have to pay this
jaw-dropping 25% sales tax, but we don't--so it amounts to prices you'd
expect for Mexican rustbait IF the shipping does not kill you.
