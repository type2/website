Subject: RE: Busted for Speeding!

&gt;Anybody else have any stories of fast Buses and surprised passengers
&gt;or onlookers?


First off, congratulations on your almost-ticket!

I think I could add a thing or two about &quot;surprised passengers and
onlookers&quot;, but the speed of the bus had nothing to do with it ;)

But on the subject of speeding ...

I recently installed a new (to me) instrument cluster on my 70 bus
-- p.o. had one from a '75 in there. Everything was fine except the
lights for the speedo and gas gauges -- didn't seat the lamps right,
so they're usually not working (easy fix, but I've been lazy).

Anyways, my girlfriend (who doesn't understand the VW thing at all)
reluctantly agreed to let me drive us around on our errands in my
bus. Of course, I had to show off all the &quot;bells and whistles&quot;, hoping
she might convert to ACVWism. That's when she noticed that it was dark,
and so was my dash. After pointing out the obvious, she asked me
something that no one has ever asked me before --- &quot;Aren't you afraid
of getting a speeding ticket?&quot;

I laughed so hard I almost wrecked the bus.

Congrats again on that warning... I'd try it myself, but I get the
willies whenever by bus gets over 65 and starts that &quot;wind dance&quot;.
Be careful out there....
