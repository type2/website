Subject: '82 Transporter Computer

Does anyone have - or know where I could get hold of - the circuit 
diagram for the brain of my '82 Transporter?  I have the Bentley 
manual, Muir and Haynes.  I have seen a description of the contents 
of the Boschi L-Tronic manual and it doesn't LOOK as though the board 
is referred to in any detail.

Anyone have any ideas?

Greetings from downunder,  I look forward to any comments.
