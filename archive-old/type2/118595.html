Subject: Restore or Replace my Propane tank on 78 Westy ?

I am in the process of restoring my 1978 Westy, and am looking for
recommendations
for the propane stove tank. I have never yet used it, but want to ensure it is
in good working order
and no leaks. To that end I will be replacing the lines, regulators, etc. The
tank itself
is also somewhat rusty. Options I am considering:

1) Restore my existing tank by venting any gas, removing regulators, having it
sandblasted
    and painted, or powder coated. Then re-installing new regulators and
lines. Is this approach safe ??
    The plus is I keep the original equipment. The minus is I still have the
old fixtures for refilling
    and am worried that some day it may cause an issue getting it refilled.

2) Replace with a brand new tank and regulators. I looked at the one in Go
Westy. It is pricey but I
    am willing to go the cash if it is the best option. I see it is really
designed for Vanagons but
    has adaptor attachments for installing on a 78 Bus. Has anyone installed
this on a Bus ?
    Does it fit well like the original equipment ? Any other sources for new
tanks ?
    Does the Go Westy tank have the new style refill connectors ?

I appreciate any and all advice from others who have restored or replaced
their propane tanks.

Thank you,
Dean Caldwell
