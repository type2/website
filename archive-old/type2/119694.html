&gt; my memory serves me correctly, the clamp is the same on the Type 1 
&gt; engine; only its orientation when installed is different (10mm clamp 
&gt; adjusting nut faces rear [RIR] instead of to the right).

&gt; 

hello Guys  These clamps are different and wont interchange  .  Later and 
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  salem Va
