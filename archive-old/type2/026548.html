&gt;The Bosch L-Jetronic FI system is much better than carbs if well
&gt;maintained.  D-jetronic  (type3s &amp; , early type 4s, and 914's) on 
&gt;the other hand was a complete disaster.  

I liked everything you said up to this point, but have to disagree with your
condemnation of the D-Jet system.  It, like the L-Jet systems on buses gets
blamed for a lot of things that wasn't it's fault.  The #1 cause of D-Jet
trouble and subsequent removal is vacuum leaks.  The second most common
failure is trigger points (they wear down just like breaker points) and need
to be replaced every 25k-40k miles.  I will agree that the L-Jet system is a
&quot;smarter&quot; system and is more efficient, but the D-Jet was a very solid,
functional, straight-forward system.

I bought a 74 914 2.0 several years ago.  It had been converted to dual
Webers, but all the ORIGINAL FI parts were in a box that came with it.  The
FI system was removed some time in the mid 80's because it &quot;quit working&quot;
and &quot;was too expensive to repair&quot; so was replaced with a pair of carbs.  

About 3 years ago, I decided to re-install the FI.  I was prepared to buy a
lot of new parts and spend months getting it to work right.  I was wrong.  I
bought all new fuel and vacuum lines, bolted the whole mess on and fired it
up.  It took only 1 day to do it.  I did replace the trigger points in the
distributor (work just like breaker points except they send the signal to
the ECU to tell it when to fire the injectors) for $70.  It's been trouble
free since.
