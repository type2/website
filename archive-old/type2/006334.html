Just for FYI. When I was doing the inside of my 79 Loaf, I wanted sound
proofing just like many of you on the list have written.  I first sprayed a
rubber undercoating on the walls, both exterior and interior as best as I
could. I then found that NAPA has a package of soundproofing materials that
are really neat. Once you decide were you want this little honey 12 inches
square, or if you decide to cut it, you tear off the sticky side and press.
If you want it to conform to the ribs on the floor as example, just have a
hair dryer and give it some warmth and it will conform to whatever you want.
Sorry I don't remember the product name. A pack of six use to cost about 20
bucks. This may seam kinda expensive, but the value in being able to put it
anywhere, make it stick and conform is well worth the money.
