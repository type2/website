Subject: Re: [T2] Carb rebuild and worn throttle shafts

I don't know what the spec is, but for them to be in acceptable
condition, wiggling the throttle shaft should be a nearly
imperceptable looseness. Most folks send them to Rimco to have the
shafts rebushed.

 I have removed my stock dual carbs and are running CB's now. I have rebuild

are
 worn. How can I easily tell if the shaft is worn? How loose will it be? Will
 it be something easily noticeable? I have never dealt with throttle shafts
and
 have only done a basic rebuild of a progressive carb before, so I am not
sure
 what kind of wear I am looking for. If they are worn, can they be fixed
 inexpensively or should I just keep them for spare parts?
