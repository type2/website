&gt; &gt;   Lastly, is it possible to
&gt; &gt;find one in any other color besides brown, orange, or monkey-vomit green?
&gt;
&gt; oh, and to answer your question - NO, if you want a '76-'79.  you're stuck
&gt; with chrome yellow, MONKEY VOMIT GREEN (that's actually the official name -
&gt; I'm serious - call your dealer!) and Mexico biege.

Ummmm.... Uhhhh...  Chris, I'm pretty happy with my (original sticker
says:) Pastel White '76 hardtop Westy.  I *think* that the factory shipped
Westies in the colors you mentioned as part of the floor plan, but that if
you were willing to wait a bit, you could order pretty nearly any combo of
cabinets, colors and upholstery you wanted.
