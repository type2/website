&gt; I have a Weber Progressive on my 77 Westy and it runs great. It idles
&gt; sweet, has just as much power and I still get 18-21 MPG - just like I
&gt; did before my FI system died.
&gt; stock vacuum/centrifugal dizzy. 

Is it a centrifugal advance distributor (009) or a vacum advance distributor (stock) and if so, where does your vacuum plug into on your carb? Does your  fuel distribution box under the carb have a port for the brake vacuum assist as well?  Thanks,
chris
