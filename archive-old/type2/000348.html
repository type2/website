Subject: I'm a bus driver again (parts needed)
Message-ID: &lt;000001bf208a$b3052de0$3ecb70ce_at_tedebare&gt;

I drove my new (to me) 71 bus for the first time other than the test drive.
Had to change oil, tune it up, change transmission oil, check fuel lines,
etc. Ran great except it pops out of 4th gear. :(. I have a rebuilt tranny
to go in ASAP.

However I need the following parts ASAP:
1. Sliding door handle w/lock
2. Both interior dome light units,
3. Light switch
4. Instrument cluster

Any help in locating these items would be GREATLY appreciated as I need them
quickly. To all those friends that are already looking let me know if you
find any so as not to duplicate efforts.

Many ,many thanks for any and all help I can get. TIA TBear

Don't take life too seriously - you'll never live through it.
