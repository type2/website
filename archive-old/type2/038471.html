Subject: 03/1980 Vanagon found for sale

If anyone is into the Vanagons, the local U-pull it has a complete one for 
sale. They had 1000 on the window, but money talks Im sure. Decent body but 
it has a bash just above the passenger headlight and below the windshield. 
Looks like it was done awhile back and has surface rust.

Anyways, if anyone is interested, I can go find out more and take some pics. 
Engine looked all there and fairly clean. Still has the FI system. Only 
thing I saw missing was the radio.
