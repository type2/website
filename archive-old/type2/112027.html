Subject: Re: [T2] Help: Looking for a throttle microswitch for a 1977 VW
  Van

77 Calif buses never had a microswitch on top of the
throttle housing. 

75/early 76 and 79 Calif did. 75/early 76 used it to
control the electric EGR valve and 79 Cal used it for
60/40 enrichment with the O2 sensor.

Unplug the connecter at the air flow meter and tell me
how many terminals are in it. 6 or 7?
 
On the left side of the gas tank panel, how many
relays do you have. 1 or 2?

Sounds like you have a fuel pressure problem and you
are not dumping manifold vacuum at the pressure
regulator. This in effect acts as an accelerator pump
by raising fuel pressure and making the system richer.

 After years of looking I have just bought a lovely
 1977 VW campmobile.  It
 was originally sold in 1977 in California and has a
 2l engine with a Bosch
 L-Jetronic fuel injection system.  The engine runs a
 treat but under full
 load (i.e. when I put my foot down) it stutters a
 bit and becomes unhappy.
 I took it to a mechanic who knows about vw fuel
 injection systems and he
 showed me where there are two wires hanging down
 near where the throttle
 cable reaches the engine, and where there is a piece
 of the fuel injection
 system missing.  &lt;snip&gt;
