Subject: Re: Still No Start (77FI): Ideas?
Message-ID: &lt;374572C2.FA5ABA82_at_netzero_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Good advice (and apparently the resistor block was the problem), but I
&gt; seem to remember that a 78 would run WITHOUT the AFM EVEN HOOKED UP!
&gt; (apparently it goes to some default settings or something). Am I
&gt; remembering this right? What would keep the double relay (fuel pump)
&gt; running after the starter stopped? I distinctly remember driving down
&gt; the road once and pulling off cause it was running poorly and not
&gt; responding, finding the connector to the AFM off- remembering that I'd
&gt; had it out just before I'd started- hooked it back up, and it was just
&gt; fine again! This was in the mid 80's, so maybe it's one of those dreaded
&gt; flashbacks they always warned about!

Al,
This is a fun topic :-)
I contend that a FI bus should not start much less run with the AFM
unplugged and the two FI buses I've had would not start or run with the
AFM unplugged.

However, Steve Dolan and others have started their Buses with AFM
unplugged but I think Steve said his would die if he gave it gas.  And
others like you have driven with the AFM unplugged.

Here's why I don't think it should work:  When you initially engage the
starter, there is a signal wire on the solenoid that sends power to the
double relay, and it closes the fuel pump side and starts the fuel
pump.  If the engine does not start and you release the key, the fuel
pump relay will open and the pump will stop.

If the engine does start, the flap in the AFM deflects because of the
incoming air.  When it deflects, an arm attached to the flap moves and
allows two contacts to come together.  These contacts enable the fuel
pump to continue running after the signal from the solenoid has
stopped.  So as the starter disengages the signal from the solenoid
stops and the fuel pump would quit except for the AFM safety switch
contacts closing and allowing the fuel pump to continue to run.

This safety switch in the AFM is also responsible for shutting off the
fuel pump in the event of the engine stalling.  The engine stalls, the
flap closes all the way and breaks the contact for the fuel pump.

So that's my case as to why it should not start or run with the AFM
disconnected.  As for why it works for some folks, I have no
explanation.
