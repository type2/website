Subject: strange head temp gauge
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.9907061900200.7492-100000_at_tucson.Princeton.EDU&gt;

I recently ordered a VDO gauge from a reputable bus supplier, and wired up 
the bus for the cylinder head temp. sensor. 

Problem: the gauge doesn't have the signal inputs for the sensor! Just +
and gnd.  the instructions/diagram show S1 and S2 spade connections that
just aren't there. 

The back of the gauge looks like: 2 connections for light bulb. + and gnd
connections. 2 long screws for mounting. something missing.

Has anybody else seen this. Ron, if you are reading this?

Rebertha is almost ready to roll, as soon as I put the engine in, and soon
after, the donated boomin' sound system. Summer Sessions, anyone?
