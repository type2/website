&gt; Say what?  The oil cooler air on the doghouse cooler is exhausted through
&gt; the front tin and doesn't go to the #3 head.

It doesn't blow over the head fins, but it blows right over the tin 
shrouding the #3 cylinder.  I expect that the tin itself is ~50 deg F 
hotter than at the same place on the #1 cylinder, if not more.  Does this 
effect head temp?  Probably not, it's probably negligible.  *shrug*
