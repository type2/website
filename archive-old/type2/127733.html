Subject: Re: [T2] A TOUGH question to answer concisely. 

1: What wire do I ground out on the gauge to get it to Peg to Full? 
2: Does the fuel sender just unscrew? 
3: What are the resistances I should have at my fuel sender for the
range. I.e. 100ohms at empty and 5,000 at full or whatnot. 

1) not sure, look in the library under &quot;fuel guage&quot; there's a write up

2) yeah, just unscrew it counter clockwise..just did mine right now.  Just be careful to no drop the O-ring into the tank

3)10 ohms full  70 ohms empty
