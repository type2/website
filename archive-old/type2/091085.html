&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt; I'm putting my engine back together after installing heads.  What I can't
&gt; remember is hoe the metal plate underneath the generator stand goes

Louvers down, opening to right side of engine.  remember that the purpose
of the louvers is to stop oil from being flung into the breather by the
action of the crankshaft.
