Subject: Dropping a Vanagon gas tank

Volks,

Well, my gas gauge quit working in the Vanagon.  Usually not a big deal
for me in a bus, as the gauges were always weak in the bays and I
am pretty used to this. Instead of filling by the gauge you fill every
150 miles or so on the odometer, not a problem.  Alas, the vanagons have
the added joy of a weak odometer so I am now driving with a 2-gallon gas
can and filling by the gas can.

I have a replacement sender and I know it's a matter of dropping the tank
to install it but I have never done this before.  I would love to hear
from people who have done this.  Especially I would love to hear that I
can lower the driver's side only and avoid unhooking the fill tube.  Is
this possible?
