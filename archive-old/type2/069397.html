Subject: Bentley 63-67 for 62?

Can anyone tell us how good the Bentley
1963-1967 book would be for those working
on a 1962 Deluxe?  It seems that it would
be mostly relevant/accurate.  If not - what
is the best book for general maintenance
repair for 1962 models?  (We have the Muir book
already, but used to find the Bentley for later
models helpful at times when working on a 1969 we 
used to have).

Brian and Stephanie
