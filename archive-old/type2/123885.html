Subject: Re: [T2] Rust question

Their page says

Tested according to the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) and
United States Navy Specifications.

and also

500 HOUR Testing Results

maybe a google would reveal the test specs. Or maybe an email to the
manufacturer....

&gt; I'm not sure I understand what these folks did.
They need to have a better description of the test procedures and what
 they actually did to each piece of metal.
 In the &quot;real&quot; scientific world this study would get an &quot;F&quot;.
 Maybe I missed their test procedures here someplace...
