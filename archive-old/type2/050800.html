Subject: [T2] More Questions re:79 Westy :-) removal of appliances

How much effort, and what is the procedure for removing the
sink/cabinet/icebox appliances in my Westy in order to redo the floor? Is
this a major undertaking? I am assuming the green carpet goes right under
the cabinet work?
Thanks,
Courtney
