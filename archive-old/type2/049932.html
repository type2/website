Subject: [T2] Odometers

I was wondering if any of you know anything about the
odometer/speedometers for the early Bays. I found one and would like to
know if they are rare, or common. Were they available all years? Dealer
option or factory? Any info would be nice. I am not interested in selling
it, just finding out more about it.
