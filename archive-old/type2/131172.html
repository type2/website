Subject: Tranny Leak?

Hello,

I crawled under my 72 van today and noticed &quot;thick gooey&quot; oil near the front 
of the tranny. Oil was all over the limiting stop and the bonded rubber 
mount, which is where the gearshift housing resides.

The tranny works well I have never had any problems with it ...yet. Where 
could this oil be coming from (i.e. assuming I don't have a major cracks) 
and how easy is it to fix? I am not sure if there is a gasket between the 
gearshift housing and the body of transaxle. I assume if this needs 
replacing I will need to remove the tranny. How much work is this once the 
engine is out?

Thanks in advance, Phil.
