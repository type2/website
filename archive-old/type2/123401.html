Subject: RE: [T2] noise when starting heater

Hi James,

The screeching noise is probably from the blower fan.  If the bearings are 
going bad (as most of them do), it will make a screech.  If the situation 
gets bad enough, you may need to replace the blower.  Not a big job, and not 
too annoying.  To try to wring some more life out of your current blower, 
you may want to remove it from the Bus, disassemble it, and re-grease all 
the parts.  That should hold you until the weather gets warm.

If you want heat that's even better, consider replacing the stock blower 
with an inline &quot;tunnel blower&quot; from a boat shop or www.boatus_dot_com.  The 
stock fan runs all the time, but it blows air to the front only at idle.  
Inside the blower housing are 2 little flaps that close when the engine fan 
starts pushing more air than the blower does.  An inline fan runs all the 
time, but can supplement the engine fan's CFM even at highway speeds.  Check 
the type2_dot_com archives for further details.

Good luck!
