Subject: Re: [T2] Smog specifics for 68-79 busses

&gt; 1977 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 OC, 2 FR, EGR
&gt; 1978 All -- PCV, ACL, 16 EVAP, 2 10 OC, 2 10 FR, EGR, 12 AIS
&gt; 1979 Type 2 MFI -- PCV, 16 EVAP, OC, FR, 13 EGR, 2 O2S, 2 CEC

&gt; Legend:

&gt; ACL - Thermostatic Air Cleaner

I have complained about this to the Calif Air Resources Board repeatedly.
Fuel injected buses from mid 76 to 79 do NOT have Thermostatic Air
Cleaners.....never ever!

&gt; The emission test is not done on the dyno for some reason.  They leave it in
&gt; neutral the whole time.  At least for 1978, they test %CO2, %02, HC(PPM) and
&gt; %CO but not NO(PPM).

This depends on the county/city you live in. In the attainment areas, you get
the dyno job. This tests NOX.

Fresno is dyno. As far as I heard, San Francisco is going to dyno test real
soon.
