Subject: RE: [T2] bus utility

&gt;The engine wasn't new and leaked oil like the Exxon
&gt;Valdez and the gearbox was as tempermental as
&gt;manic-depressive without his medication but she kept
&gt;on pulling even though the CV's had to be replaced
&gt;within a month.

I second toasting CV joints. When I pulled my Hyundai to Chattanooga from 
Norfolk with my Type IV (stock) powered Beetle I started up the mountain when 
a conversion van started to pass me in the next lane but dropped back and 
followed me up the mountain apparently just to see if I could do it. At the 
top he passed me easily (I was running maybe 20 mph, pretty steep) with a van 
load of folks giving me the thumbs up....

On a few of the corners the CV's started popping as they reached their limit. 
I only put another few thousand miles on the car before I took it down to 
restore properly and I haven't gotten it back on the road yet.

Went from a simple lifestyle of a single guy to a very busy college attending 
father and husband with a full time job, mortgage and car payment... The end 
is in sight (in about a year) so I'll be able to get back to having a life! 
Just got to get the bus done first.
