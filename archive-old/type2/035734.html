Subject: Re: spiral easy out

...An easy out is a left hand threaded tapered drill i.e. when you drill in a 
normally re-
versed fashion, &quot;out&quot;, the easy out goes in and because of the taper, at some 
point it
should catch the broken insert or stud and draw the broken piece out. 
Although I've
had a modicum of success with them, generally, unless you can get a drill 
with a cen-tering attachment (an accessory mounted to the front of the drill 
to keep it from walk-
ing), and use a steady, slow feed, the bit tends to enter off center. If the 
object can be mounted in a drill press, all the better. If you have access to 
a drill with the centering attachment, best bet is to use it to start a pilot 
hole in the broken stud and
then switch to the easy out. The couple three times I've been successful 
that's what
worked for me. Also, if the easy out was too cheap, you might reconsider even 
using it
at all. Snap-on easy outs work...Vermont American, Ohio Forge, etc. don't...
