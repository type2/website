Subject: RE: [T2] Alt vs. Gen &amp; idiot lights

George warns:
&gt;&gt;It's oil pressure.  Should be on after you turn the key on and before you
crabnk the engine. If it's not, fix it!&lt;&lt;

It's coming on at idle all the time.  Like I said, I'm getting a new gauge
and the relief valve-mounted sender either this or next week, because I'd
rather not depend on an idiot light alone.  I plan on keeping the light
hooked up though.
