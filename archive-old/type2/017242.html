Subject: Re: Ferry to Kodiak

According to some brochures I have, the overall dimensions indicated in
the litterature are more or less the same for 68-79 buses but vary
slightly as you can see:
1971 passenger bus:  14 ft. 6 in. x 5 ft. 7 in.
1968: 174 in. x 69.5 in.
1967: 168.5-169.3 x 68.9-70.9 (varies according to model)
1972: 4.45 m x 1.815 m
1974 Microbus: 4.545 m x 1.760 m
1975 Microbus 2000: 4.545m x 1.670 m
1976 Kombi: 179 in. x 69.3 in.
You get the general idea...which should be enough for ferry purposes,
but the best thing is to have someone measure it though!
Have a nice trip.  Was in Kodiak about 15 years ago and will try to dig
out in my junk some contacts I had there.
