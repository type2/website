HEllo LISt,

I want to thank every one for their replies to my last
couple of letters. You have been a big help! I have a
small question. I live in Wilmington, North Carolina
and do not have a FLAPS near me. Do any of you North
Carolina listees know where the closest FLAPS is to
Wilmington?

Thanks again!
