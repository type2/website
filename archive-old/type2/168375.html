Subject: Re: [T2] Engine cooling air

&gt; So this is my idea. Fabricate something to fit over the fan
&gt; that has some sort of duct work that leads over and up to
&gt; the outside vents. It wouldnt have to go all the way up, just
&gt; up to that area so that the engine can pull in cooler air.
&gt; 
&gt; 
   IIRC, the 411's had this on the engine...If you can find an
original, it might be easier to fab something from the cover
up into the vents... ;-)
