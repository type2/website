&gt; &gt; try that. It should show up as an indention in the backing plate to
&gt; &gt; accomodate the longer 38 amp gen.  There's pics on the Hon. Ron Van
&gt; &gt; Ness's Rebuild pages in the library.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind too that the fan hub is offset too to keep it from being
&gt; grossly out of adjustment when installing the indented backing plate.  I'm
&gt; always looking for this kind of stuff at swaps - core engines that might
&gt; have the 38 amp generator and funky backing plate.  Hard stuff to find
&gt; otherwise.

Aha!

Here's a piece of info that I've been looking for!  So there *is* a
different fan hub for the 38A generator.  No new hub was included with the
so-called &quot;alternator kit&quot; I purchased, so I guess that the 30A bug hub is
the same as the alternator hub.

I noticed this when installing the fan onto my new alternator.  If you
just plop the fan onto the hub it touches the backing plate.  I put both
of the thick washers between the fan and the hub before I got the
correct clearance.  The thick wavy washer is still on the nut side of the
fan, so the fan should get sufficient support.  Any thoughts on this?  

I guess I should get an alternator (or 30A generator) fan hub to put
things right when it's next apart.  Anyone have an extra?
