&gt; I HATE replacing the alternator in a Type 4 Bus.  I started disassembly at
&gt; 
&gt; The hardest part for me was (and always is) getting that lower mounting bolt
&gt; through.  I always have to wiggle the alternator around and curse and swear
&gt; and push on the bolt and bang on it and sprinkle the blood of a newly

if you ever find that trick trademark it and collect royalties...but tell
