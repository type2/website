&gt;
&gt; I have yet to see a reference to &quot;bench bleeding&quot; in a VW manual.  The
&gt; problem with bench bleeding is that you cannot get the MC into the vehicle
&gt; without spoiling that great bleeding job that you have done.  If the
&gt; brakes do not bleed properly, something is wrong and resorting to exotic
&gt; procedures will just prolong the agony.
&gt;
&gt; Do you have disks?  Did you miss a bleeder on the proportioning valve?
&gt;
&gt;
I have front discs like most '75s. I only bled the bottom of the front discs
as Bentley did not make any mention of having to bleed both the top and
bottom. I must admit that for a job as significant as replacing or bleeding
brakes tends to be, Bentley really did a poor job of walking one through it.

I should have read Ratwells write-up first.

The greatest single cause of atheism in the world today is Christians, who
acknowledge Jesus with their lips and walk out the door, and deny Him by
their lifestyle. That is what an unbelieving world simply finds
unbelievable.
