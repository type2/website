I use a standard floor jack with a wood platform mounted to it approx
12x12&quot;. I think a much smaller surface would be a problem because the jack
will have a different tilt in different positions. Especially when all the
way lowered my engine would probablky be hard to control and tip off with
such a small surface. And when you roll it around it may get tippy as
well.
My best advice would be to find a high lift SUV type floor jack with about
24&quot; of lift so that you can use it for all sorts of things and mount a
plywood platform to that when you do engine or tranny R&amp;R.



&gt; I think I saw the same jack at Sam's Club.  The box showed it lifting a
&gt; motorcycle.  It had a level platform about 1' x 2' which looked ideal for
&gt; pulling VW engines.  It was also around $95-$100 and I was also wondering if
&gt; any VW people have tried it.  Thanks.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Noticed a new jack at Costco the other day.  It's marketed as being for
&gt; ATV's and golf carts, but it sure looks like it would work well for pulling
&gt; the engine out of a bus or bug.  It's low with two lifting arms, kind of
&gt; like a small high-lift pallet jack.  Have any experienced VW folks seen it,
&gt; and do you think it will work for an engine pull?  Price is ~$95.00.
