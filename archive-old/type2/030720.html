Hey all,

My '71 bus has a problem I'm not at all familair with.

I put a set of dual dellorto carbs on it after a top end rebuild and have
no experience with dual carbs. The issue is that they pop....like fuel
starvation pop....it also diesels badly after turning off the motor. I do
realize they have to be synched and have been attempting that for the past
few days....However I've not been able to get it anywhere near running
corectly. Consensus is that its running too lean. Any advise? Oh yeah,
it's a '71 bus, 1600 dp, dual dellorto carbs.

Thanks!
