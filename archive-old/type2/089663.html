Subject: Re: [T2] Dual batteries?

for what you are proposing you need to invest in a small700 to 1000 watt 
generator. and possibly a battery bank.  This gives you a generator to 
run on or charge your 2 or 3 battery battery bank with.  get deep cycle 
batteries for bank.  I have set this kind of setup in conversion vans 
and it is just a downsizing of what is in the RVs.  Have a similar  way 
to operate in my westy  right now.  The thing i am working on though is 
a way to quiet the generator down a  little  more.  These units are 
small only weighing about  35 to 40 lbs.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Wondering if anyone has a good method of running dual
&gt; batteries on a T2? Ive heard several different ways
&gt; including buying or making you own switching device
&gt; that regulates the charging and use of both batteries.
&gt; I'm not much of an electrical guy so help me out here.
&gt; Is it worth the trouble? Like I've said earlier I plan
&gt; to live in my bus and would be using lights, a laptop,
&gt; and possibly a couple of other small devices, not sure
&gt; what the amp draw on everything would be. Any ideas
&gt; welcome.
&gt;    On a different note I was thinking for names my bus
&gt; could be christened &quot;Fartilda&quot; any objections?
&gt; Thanks, peace,
&gt; Giles
