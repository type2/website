I don't really listen to the dead anymore.    I don't smoke pot.   I don't do
drugs.     I have long hair.  I sometimes wear tiedyes, but not much. I think
they turned into rags.   I went on tour, man, and was one of those people who
swarmed into town, and out again.  In a VW bus.   Tour rat.   Great trips.
across the country and back.    Lost count after 100 or so shows.   Stopped
going to shows about 93.      Met a lot of really great people.   Made good
friends.  Yes there are flakazoids too, but there are everywhere.
Unfortunately.

I hope Phil's liver transplant works out okay.   I remember him kicking out
some excellent bass lines in Sacramento one year, like nothing I'd hear
before.   Summer of 91?   92?  Had just come from Vegas in a 61 standard.  But
Phil can't sing.  oh well.     Hope he's okay.

Clara
