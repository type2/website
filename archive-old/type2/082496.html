&gt; On the right side of the engine, there is a plastic sheath of wires that
&gt; come up through the engine tin (right above the mustache bar), it looks like
&gt; it may be the wires to the alternator.  The wires fork, one set going to a plug
&gt; that appears to belong to the voltage regulator, and then there is 1 single
&gt; heavy gauge wire (red) that has been cut-off.  I assume that this wire goes 
&gt; to the + side of the battery, sound correct?  

If it's the wire I'm thinking about, it actually goes to the starter.
The other wire w/ the plug sounds correct about going to the reg.

&gt; Then, from the voltage regulator plug, there is a short wire (blue if I remember correctly) that goes to a small plastic connector, sorta looks like 1 side of an in-line fuse connector but rectangular, any idea what this connects to?
&gt;

If no one else knows exactly what this goes to, I can check my bus
(79) later and try and see where it goes on mine.
