Subject: Re: [T2] urgent AIRS assistance needed in Alabama

Well Spiffy is safe and sound in the Mitchell Service
Center near Tuscoolsa Alabama.  I saw the e-mail for
help and knew I was the closest so what the heck. I
contacted James and he told me the location and the
problem.  I then contacted Andy, a VW expert (in my
opinion) where I work and he also spoke to James about
the problem and determined that the spring was in fact
broke and valve apparently didn't go into the piston. 
Andy was also familiar with the town and basically
said for safety reasons we needed to get him out of
that area.  We contacted U-Haul but couldn't get a
trailer but AAA would tow it provided Andy was with
the bus.  We left around 5:30pm and about 90 minutes
later saw him next to the road along with a truck that
also stopped to help.  We made our intro's and looked
at the Bus. We called AAA and since this place is in
the middle of nowhere they initially had no idea where
we were.  We looked for some signs when the guy in the
truck said he could probally see the road signs with
his scope and promptly pulled out his rifle looked
through it and read them to us.  I figured he was
going to pull off a couple rounds just out of habit
but didn't.  Whether he was going to shoot some
varments later or just look for a tall building, who
knows.  He seemed like a pretty good kid though and
left once he new AAA was on the way.

About an hour later AAA arrived loaded the bus and we
drove about 70 miles through the most remote parts of
Alabama till we finally got to Mitchells at about
10pm.  We dropped off the bus and went to a store for
some food.  James stocked up on supplies and
apparently figured he would be there a couple days but
Andy thinks he'll be on the road by the afternoon.

Granted the orange, yellow, green, and white rattle
can paint job on the '72 Bay was unique but the rest
of the bus was solid.  I bet there was more grime on
my windshield than there was on the underside of his
bus!  Solid, absolutely no visible rust and overall a
damm good bus and the guy he bought it off took good
care of it.  The breakdown, well just happened. Hope
he gets a lot of years out of it. 

As for James, he's a surfer guy, early 20's, nice kid.
Type of guy that belongs in a Bay.  Hope he gets it
back on the road with minimal ($$$) pain.

As for me, seven hours and 245 miles later, I think
I'm going to finish my beer and go to bed.

Later

 forwarded message from Rob Henley (72camper_dot_com)---
 
Well Spiffy broke down in Alabama. He has a big
problem. I am not a mechanic, but I told James to take
off the valve covers and as feared its not good. 
He said the spring retainer on the #2 valve was
laying in the valve cover and the spring is twisted.
The rod is &quot;loose&quot;. I am not sure what this means
except it sucks. Possibly a dropped valve? The #1 is
fine as are #3 and 4.   
He is in Uniontown, AL just west of Selma, AL which
is about 40? miles west of Montgomery on highway 80.
If anyone can help please call me at 704 502-8927 or
James at 281 935-7330.
If nothing else he needs to find a mechanic in Selma
or thereabouts.
  Thanks!   Rob
