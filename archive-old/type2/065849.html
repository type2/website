Subject: Re: Fuel Leak

&gt; I wonder if anyone can offer me advice on a fuel leak I have.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I noticed a patch of fuel under my van, it was dripping from
&gt; the bottom of the fuel pump, and the fuel line from the tank to the
&gt; pump was soaked.  I replaced the fuel line from tank to pump last night,
&gt; and cleaned up the surrounding area.
&gt; 
&gt; Today after a long run I again noticed fuel under the van, about a dozen
&gt; drops in a hour or so.  On further inspection the line from tank to pump
&gt; was dry as a bone aswell as the line to the carbs.  Infact the fuel was not
&gt; dropping from the flange where the two halves of the pump join, (where it
&gt; had been dropping from before), and the pump was dry itself. The fuel was
&gt; dripping from the flange between the pump and the main block, and was also
&gt; dripping off the low point where the engine is bolted to the transaxle.
&gt; 
&gt; The overflow pipe from the fuel pipe was soaked aswell, but I am not sure if
&gt; I cleaned this up last night , after the leak from the tank/pump line had been
&gt; fixed.
&gt; 
I would worry about having a tear in the diaphragm of your pump. This 
could be bad news. The new gas seems to be eating up some of the older 
seals that are on cars - this might be the case, but is pure conjecture. 
Also I just bought a burned out 71 T2 that looked like it sprang a leak 
at the fuel pump. It is not too hard to remove the fuel pump and check 
it for leaks.

My 2 cents
