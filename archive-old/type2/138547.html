Subject: Re: [T2] Please help me understand brake calipers

Scott,

&gt;&gt;Brake hose connection: would be on the upper part of the caliper with
&gt;&gt;caliper installed on the right wheel. (Sounds right)

&gt;All calipers have brake hose connection in the centre of the caliper. 
&gt;Surely
&gt;you are referring to the bleeder screw.

No : the core is for sure 73 and later, it has two bleeder screws. A red 
plastic cap is inserted on the upper inside part of the caliper, right above 
the piston. That is the only place were the hose can be connected.

The rebuilt caliper box says 251 615 108X, which is front right caliper, 
73-79. I still do not understand why the pistons cutouts are on the top. Did 
the cutouts position change between 72 and 73 ?


&gt;Pistons cutouts: both cutouts would be on the upper part of the pistons 
&gt;with
&gt;caliper installed on the right wheel. (Sounds not right)

&gt;All the 73-up calipers I have seen have two bleeder screws. This means that
&gt;there is really no left and right caliper, they are both the same, but the
&gt;pistons are rotated in the caliper to make it a left or right.

&gt;&gt;2) Assume I eventually got a correct 1973 and later right caliper. Is it 
&gt;&gt;OK
&gt;&gt;to have a 1971 caliper on the left and a 1973 and later on the right ? My
&gt;&gt;left caliper is doing working properly.

&gt;I don't think so. I am not sure what you are asking. The 73-up caliper is
&gt;different from the 71. It uses different brake pads (thicker) and the
&gt;mounting screws are larger on 73-up.

So I MUST get a correct (thin - one bleeder screw) 71-72 core unless I 
change both calipers, which seems useless to me.
