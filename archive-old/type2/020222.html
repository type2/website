&gt; i have seen ads recently for aux oil coolers for bugs that also function as
&gt; heaters as they are mounted inside the body behind the rear seat...some of
&gt; my baja-bug friends had done this years ago so their coolers wouldn't be
&gt; smashed....and they put out alot of heat(guess they are at like 200F or
&gt; so)...anyways i don't know how practical this would be in a bus...long oil
&gt; lines, location, etc..might be worth doing if you lived in point barrow,
&gt; alaska....
