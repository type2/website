Subject: Shed some light on the 34 pict-3

Aloha List,
    I am attempting to rejet my 34 pict 3 because of a noticeable
leaning out in the starting of acceleration of each gear.  I read an
article in some VW mag that I cannot remember the name of off hand, and
it said that to remedy this flat spot the idle jet needs to be
enlarged.  I have given the car a full tune up and checked the carb to
make sure that the accel pump nozzle isn't shooting the butterfly or
side of the carb.
     I am curious about how and when the different circuits work
specifically for this carb and I am curious about what jet sizes others
are running on their motors,  it would be greatly appreciated.  I have a
dual port 1776, with a 009, exhaust and a mild cam.  Not my choice,
that's how I bought it.
    Also is it possible to get a set of jets so that if I make a mistake
I can just replace them-the idle jet, air correction jet, main jet.
    Any input is appreciated.

Mahalo,
Greg
