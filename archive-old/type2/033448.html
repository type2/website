Subject: Re: Need Brake Booster

Christian:  I'll pass along a tip which appeared on this group a few years ago:
______________________________________________________________________________
 A while back someone recommended H&amp;R Booster (actually it's H&amp;R Automotive
Parts) in Dallas to rebuild brake boosters.  I sent one to Ron over night,
he sent it out today.  Total cost including COD and overnight?  $105. H&amp;R:
972-286-5516
______________________________________________________________________________


I haven't tried H&amp;R myself but I wouldn't hesitate to.

Hope this helps, Jack


&gt;I just got word that my 71 bus needs another brake booster.  I have no idea
&gt;how to go about getting one used.  The junkyards around here do not have
&gt;many VW's and this is an everyday driver.  Any advice?
