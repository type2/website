&gt;Well, the last one I came across  that failed gave warning by having
&gt;the engine die and the bus come to a stop.  Not a happy situation for
&gt;the people involved!
&gt;
&gt;Others can start to give a weak spark, resulting in hard starting.
&gt;
&gt;In any case, the problem is easily diagnosed by replacing the coil
&gt;with a spare.  If the symptom goes away, the coil is bad!  A coil is
&gt;one of those things you should keep in the spares box.

Our coil told us it was failing by occasionally sputtering and eventually
dying at high rpms. It started and idled just fine (at least as far as the
coil was concerned; we were having the warm-start solenoid problem at the
same time, which was unrelated to the coil problem). Although it's possible
to check the color of the coil's spark, I agree with George that the
easiest way to check is to replace the coil with a spare. If you don't have
a spare, even if the problem you're having turns out to be caused by
something else, it's a good time to get one. If we hadn't had one in our
recent travels out west (about 3000 miles in eleven days), we would have
been stuck for at least a day longer than we were in a small town in the
Nebraska panhandle when our coil decided to give up at rpms higher than
about 1500. The coil that went bad by the way was a Bosch blue coil, less
than two years and 20,000 miles old.

Good luck!
