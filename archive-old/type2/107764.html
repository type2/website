Subject: Mating bellhousing to trans?

The mating surfaces are clean, I have the paper gasket, and am wondering about
the best way to proceed. I think I need to put sealer on both the bellhousing
and trans(including the sides of the alignment posts?), position the gasket,
and then install the bellhousing and torque it up. Does this sound right? What
kind of sealer is good for this? Should anything be used on the threads?

Thanks,
Bill Moon
