&gt;  I was really struggling with this whole thread and wasn't quite sure why 
&gt;  until I read Chris's post. 

Does it seem that the thread has not attempted to answer the origina 
question, but rather give reason to preach about individual opinions of how 
one should drive VWs?

I believe the original poster simply wanted to know what RPM he should use as 
a shift point. I got no notion that he wanted to know how high he could rev 
each time without blowing the engine up.

I can see the poor fellow sitting in a corner emitting a profound &quot;SIGH!&quot; 
every few minutes, wondering how he could have been so misunderstood.

All factory-tachometer-equipped automoblies have a redline shown on the tach 
face. I'll bet you that he'd be satisfied if someone would say where VW would 
likely have put it if they had equipped his machine with a tach :-)

Sorry for injecting reason into this discussion. This was not meant as a 
flame, but rather as a retardant :-)
