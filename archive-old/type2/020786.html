I'm picking up Wendelin after six months absence. She's got an AVP
rebuild in her, newly (professionally) rebuilt Solex carbs, and a
replacement right heat exchanger with new gaskets (the old one wasn't
mating up to the heads properly).

I'm pretty excited, but need some help sussing out some of the finer
points. That right carb is STILL backfiring slightly, the right heat
exchanger STILL is not mating properly (but is quite improved), and
there's a small oil leak at the midline of the sump.

All told, though, it's a vast improvement. How can I make it perfect?

Nikki
