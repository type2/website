The PO had a spliced mess of wiring to the VDO gauages. I want to replace 
them with continuoius wire. Can anyone recomend High quality brand name of 
wire???  Guage (size) is not important right now, just brand name... or does 
it matter??? Seems like the original VW wire it was spliced too is of higher 
quality.

Thanks in advance
