&gt; Well Ezmereldas Tranny continues to pop out of first,

&gt; a 75 with the origanal motor in her. what year trannys
&gt; will fir her. To complicate matters I have just
&gt; purchased a 72 LB for a spare motor (thanks Brandy),
&gt; so Id like a tranny that will fit both. What are the
&gt; issues here?

I believe the 75 and 72 used the same transmission (&quot;002&quot;).  So, that's 
fortunate for you.  However, the transmission in the 76-79 (&quot;091&quot;) is a 
better transmission.

If you get a transmission of the other type, at the very least you need 
to get a new flywheel and clutch of the correct size (the bell housings 
are different).  The Type2 library should have more info.
