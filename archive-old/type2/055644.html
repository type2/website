To the List,

I just dismantled the T4 motor I was planning to rebuild as the primary
mill for my `76 Westy. I bought the motor at a swap-consequently, it
was a pig in a poke. It is a `79 two liter, and the FI stuff is intact.
After stripping this puppy I am not sure if I can use the case or not,
maybe you folks can shed a little light.

First, the center main bearing journal looks like it had a hard life.
The bearing was down to the bronze and battered. Is there a  pragmatic
method of determining if the case is shot?  The crank looked ok, no
visible scores. I`m looking at : line bore, turn crank, fit oversize
bearings, right? Any wisdom appreciated.

The rods failed the feeler-gauge test, but then the bearings were pretty worn.
Do I reuse?

One head has a dropped valve seat (valve stem did not break). Does this
eliminate it as a rebuildable core?

The cam lobes were very scored, I`m assuming I will need a new one. Any
recommendations on an aftermarket cam with a bit different grind? I
would like to  get a bit more torque/bottom end. Lift? Duration? I plan
to keep the  FI.

The hydro lifters seem ok, they were not scored or blued (strange,
because the cam is real rough) is there a rebuild procedure for these?

Pmail or post. I love you people. JBrooks OUT
