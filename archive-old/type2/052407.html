Subject: [T2] Stuck intake valve cylinder # 3 1700 cc

Volks,

Wondering if anybody has an easy way to free a stuck intake valve on
cylinder # 3 on a 1700 cc, on a 72 westy.

I tried the typical piece of hardwood and hammer.

Can I remove the head without dropping the motor?

Saw a post with the same question for a 1971 and the answer was no.

Will I have to do the same?

Craig
