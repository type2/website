 i thought
&gt;i was the only one on the list that couldn't weld... heck, even Isiah
&gt;welds...  :-)


Well, I keep the epoxy to a minimum.  I have to do rockers someday, and I
hope I have the money or moxey to get them welded in.  But I've judiciously
used epoxy to fill holes under the windshield sill (after sandblasting), and
now the battery trays.  I think they're both holding up well, but time will
tell.

Someday, welding.  But until then, saddle pals...
