Last night our 78 Transporter finally left the driveway on its maiden voyage with the rebuild of the 2 liter!  We have only one problem in that the bus will not idle and stalls if the accelerator is not constantly being feathered.  Adjustment of the idle screw and accelerator cable doesnt solve the problem.  We are assuming that some sort of vacuum leak could be the problem?  The bus is FI and the EGR valve is still there although nothing is hooked up to it (no hoses, charcoal filters etc.)  Everything else works great!  Seems like a simple fix or adjustment.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Chad
78
