hello whoever        When set ting  the end play you need to check the dead 
end play , that is with no shims.  If the dead end play is above .050  then 
the  case needs to be linebored.  You can set the end play up looser  to get 
where the motor will turn but it will  most likely  leak oil  .       Mark
