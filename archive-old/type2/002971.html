Subject: Westfalia Epilepsy

Volks,

78 Westy 2.0l F.I.:

Replaced my calipers today, and subsequently rediscovered the serenity of
smooth, silent braking.  Just after the operation, I took it for a _at_10 mile
test ride, lotsa braking from 25-35 and some good downhill - all without
**any** problems.  I additionally sealed a crack in the air
cleaner&lt;--&gt;intake distributor boot with weather stripping and duct tape
(BusDepot doesn't carry the part - anyone have a lead??), and patched two
small chip-holes I discovered in the air cleaner with squares of duct tape.
Also replaced the air filter.

Upon return, I scrubbed, showered and dressed for a dinner trip with my
wife; destination about 20 miles.  On our trip, Petunia put a stake in my
heart with the following symptoms:

- Lurching, misfiring, **something** _at_ low-to-medium RPM in every gear.  At
lower speeds, e.g. say the typical RPM at shift from 1st to 2nd, and 2nd to
3rd, the shaking, or 'lurching', was nearly violent.  Taking 2nd high into
the RPM band before shifting to 3rd had some effect, taking 3rd high before
4th was slightly better - as the shaking became less violent.  Taking 3rd to
_at_ 50mph **generally** resolved the shaking (on the umpteenth try), but the
moment I put it into 4th, again with the seizures.  Subsequently, I drove
home in 3rd, as it was unbearable to try accelerating through the shaking in
4th.  There seemed to be no clear rhyme or reason as to why she'd suddenly
cough her way out of the problem.  It is definitely **not** a
clutch/transmission problem, as listening to the engine during and after
these seizures revealed a &quot;suffocated&quot; sound - not enough noise back there,
ya know?  Like it wasn't firing on all cylinders?? During one particularly
bad episode, I pulled to the roadside to permit a line of followers to pass,
ran to the back and toyed with the throttle.  On some accelarations it would
do the same, sputter about and almost die, on others it sounded fine.
- Decrease in idle/wants to die if I pump the brakes at a standstill, in
neutral.  This sounds like a vacuum thing, but I honestly don't understand
how the vacuum system works vis a vis the brake system.  I couldn't even
find the appropriate vacuum hose in the engine compartment - don't know
where to look.  I do know that at high speeds, the brakes start biting
sooner in the depression, and later at lower - but beyond that, I'm in the
dark.

Now: (1) Can there be any way that these problems are related?  (2) Is the
sputtering problem definitely a fuel issue, e.g. suddenly clogged fuel
filter, or jacked-up fuel pump?  (3) Where do I find the vacuum for the
brake servo? (4) Anything else I'm missing?

Sorry for the verbosity, but I wanted to provide as much detail as possible.
Help!!
