&gt;&gt; I'm not familiar with the extension/compression distance on the Koni

Damage and warranties get thorny quickly. They are really meant for product
failure where you send it back and they test it.

The adjustment cam is flush with the top of the bottom part of the shock so
you wouldn't even know it's there. The key is at the top inside the upper
shell with ~5mm teeth. The main reason to acquire the specific model and not
a substitution is to avoid any problems so you can have a driving experience
like Roberto: 7 fun filled years! :-)

These are the extended and compressed dimensions of the fron Konis: 416mm
max, 270mm min

I measured some KYB gas-a-justs this morning and they are actually shorter
at 410mm max, 256mm min. Has anyone had a problem? I suspect not. Even
though it's an even shorter shock the bump stops on the front torsion arms
prevent the shock from toping out or bottoming out. It's all good.
