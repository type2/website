&gt;Bob, look on page 21, figure 5-25.  Look at the lever, right between 16 and
&gt;17.  It has a stud, with a ball end that the push rod of your throttle valve

&gt;
&gt;It isn't on the carb body, but on the lever ( I would guess that that lever
&gt;would be called the throttle valve lever, but didn't see it mentioned)

I see what you mean Dave.

Looks like the lever that the pull rod fastens to is a lever &quot;missing&quot; from 
my carb setup.

It appears I am missing that second lever; the &quot;fast idle lever&quot;.
(I have the throttle valve lever, of course.)

I wonder how I might come up with said newly-discovered-discovered-missing
&quot;fast idle lever&quot;.

Would it typically come with a new carburetor purchase, or does it have to 
come off of a NOS or junk yard found carb of original vintage/configuration?

Casper does not have this second lever, either,
so can't rob Casper to feed NewBus.
