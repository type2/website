Hi Nick,

I believe to use a cat on your bus it would be necessary to obtain and fit a
late FI system which includes a lambda sensor.

A catalytic converter does lower emissions, but to work properly it must
receive the gases with an already low level of pollutants, If the 'before
cat' exhaust gases go out of spec then the chemicals in the cat will quickly
deteriorate and you will be worse off than before plus you will have to buy
a new cat.
The air/fuel ratio for best burn and minimum emissions is around 14.7:1 and
it is necessary to have an FI system in order to come close to this across
the full rev/load ranges of the engine.
Early FI does better than carbs in this respect but with later FI you will
have a lambda sensor just before the cat with measures the oxygen in the
exhaust and it constantly tweaks the air fuel ratio to keep it as close to
14.7:1 as possible.

That sort of control is just not possible with carbs.

When tuning with carbs a slightly rich mixture will give you maximum
performance and a slightly lean mixture will give maximum economy (relative
to a 14.7:1 mixture).
It would also be possible to fiddle with FI (no cat) to improve mpg (eg
reducing the fuel pressure or using smaller injectors)

So although FI + cat will give you better emissions a carb can be tuned for
better economy.

My now dead '73 with a 1600 twin port 34 pict 3 carb and 009 distributor did
25 to 26mpg (imperial) the '98 with 1600 FI and cat does 24 to 25mpg, but I
do have better performance and a higher top speed.

Good luck

One more question that came to mind while I was looking at the parts for my
exhaust: What are the implications of putting a Catalyst on a Federal Bus?
One of the things my friends always chide me about is that I am a big
environmentalist, but I drive this old polluting bus with low mpg. (I am
working on the latter. I have improved it by 3.5 mpg since I got it, but I
still have a long way to go. I see 13-15mpg right now which I know is low
for this bus. I am pretty sure that most of this is wheel bearings which
will be done Real Soon Now (tm)! )

  If I can put a Catalyst on my Federal bus I would do it to lower my
emissions. Will this also lower my mpg? Any gotchas to watch for if I do
this?

Thanks again. You people are the best!
