Subject: Re: [T2] AVP engine, question about shipping

When I got my AVP engine and had it shipped here to Charlotte, NC it was an
even $120. It comes on a crate wrapped in a cardboard box.


I didn't have a core.

Good luck!!

Subject: [T2] AVP engine, question about shipping


&gt; Hello list,
&gt;
&gt; I am saving toward buying an AVP 1700cc engine for my
&gt; bus. The one I am looking at runs about $1090 right
&gt; out. The only expense that I am clueless about is
&gt; shipping. For those of you that have bought AVP
&gt; engines, how much did you pay in shipping? How did
&gt; they handle their core shipping? Did they pick it up
&gt; the the same time they droped off the rebuilt engine?
&gt; Will shipping the core cost extra or is that included
&gt; in the shipping charge they give you? I live in
&gt; Wilmington NC which is all the way across the country
&gt; so I expect that the shipping will be high but how
&gt; high? Can anyone help me out with a ball park figure?
&gt; Thanks!
&gt; David Kelly
