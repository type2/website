I regret to inform...but I don't know if I'll have a VW to drive.. :
(...unless I get my money together and get that pop top that I've been
wanting...or Splittybus..whichever I find first for the right price without
the rust....Hopefully, I can sell the stuff i have....so here's a list....

-1967 baja bug, no engine, or interior (needs finishing)  have heaterchannel
for passenger side, driverside is good, with only a bit of patching needed.
I also have quarterpanel patches for the very bottoms (like the horizontal
surface that tucks under) for both sides.  Other than that, and an engine,
it needs floors (oops) I think that's about it..The fiber glass kit is in
decent shape, has a crack in the front, but I can fix that easy.  this also
has a lowerable front suspension (good for baja's ya know : )  I'm willing
to do some work to this puppy if I can get $300 for it....

-69 bug wreck.....this thing is gone...anyone need body parts????  It's got
a front hood which is just great, as well as a decklid and two good doors..I
also have most of the parts off the 69 (was an autostick so I've got a spare
tranny too)  Seat frames, and springs for front and rear.  also have front
suspension.  Torsion for IRS (dunebuggy folks)
make an offer (not expectin to get rich here)  does have a new front
firewall and driverside heater channel

-Fiberglass dunebuggy body.  No cracks, bad paint (flakin off..I did some
sanding on it...there's a hole in the hood for the gas filler, but that
would be easy to patch if you didn't want it there...has windshield
frame....$300

-1967 fenders...repairable, little surface rust..but nothing that couldn't
be ground off......$75 for all four......

Let me know what you need and I&quot;ll see if I have it.....I don't want to part
the 67...but if it's a non essential part.....I could do that....

-Westy Interior, and Fiberglass roof sections...this is for the 68-7X
angles toward rear (hinge in front)  $100 for all except fold down
seat...this includes long cabinet, icebox/sink, fold out table...over head
compartment...

help me buy my bus : )

&gt;
&gt; a few people have already mentioned planning our next show or even a group
&gt; meeting. Now is the time to start planing. Are we going to shoot for when
it
&gt; warms up? I liked having it at the park, and I bet if we organize how we
&gt; park, Buses w/ Buses, bugs w/ bugs, that we could fit more vehicles in
that
&gt; lot. Anyways, we need to start planning.
&gt; Although my bus will be getting a cosmetic makeover when the sun decides
to
&gt; show its friendly face again and there is a chance of lucy not making it,
I
&gt; am looking forward to seeing everyone and meeting the people I didn't get
a
&gt; chance to meet last time.
&gt; Jay, Thanks again for the heater boxes, there are in better shape than you
&gt; made me think. I think they will turn out good.
