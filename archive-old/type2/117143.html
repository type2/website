if you go to the 72 westy album you can see what i did for my floor.  i
used rust convertor over the floor and then rolled on some bed liner stuff
and then used a piece of 1/2 5'x5' baltic birch which i then cut to fit and
routed down the edges so it fit into the floor and didn't bounce like the
stock floors do.  i never actually got to drive the bus with this in as i
abandoned the project when i got my 73 adventure camper but this floor will
be going in the 73 as i put so much work into it.  btw, the roof pictured
is for sale if anyone is interested, you can see a bit of the new headliner
that i put in which turned out excellent if i do say so myself for a first
time job with no templates to go off of.  i used 2 pieces of 5x5 baltic
birch to make it and it curves nicely and is quite strong.  i never got
around to making the cabinets but i'm sure they would have turned out just
as cool also.  i'm in long beach, ca if interested.
