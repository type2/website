Subject: Re: fuel sender hole

Thanks for the reply, I only just got the &quot;negative responce&quot; you
mentioned. My camper has already had this mod &amp; i will be putting a
new &quot;lid&quot; as you recomended. Also the hatch was only cut 3 sides &amp; is
covered with a fire retadent layer then insulation then 5mm ply
sealedin place.
Again thankyou for a constructive responce

&gt; After you deal with the fuel gauge sender, be sure to seal
thisopening with a 
&gt; metal &quot;lid&quot; of some sort.  

P.S
To the poster who said save the flames, Right On!
My wife is expecting also &amp; I'll be damned if she gets stuck in our
winter (UK), this year is forcast to be the worst on record! I washed
mrwhipy on Saturday with HOT soapy water &amp; the water was frozen on the
ground in under a min!
