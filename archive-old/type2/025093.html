I have dealt with the Bus Depot numerous times in the past and have always 
rec'd outstanding service!  

Those who have complaints: I work in an industry where ship dates are 
critical to meet safety standards, i.e. a shop can shut down for a day or two 
if our manufacturers don't have a product in stock.  That costs money and 
could be potentially hazardous.  Even then, the product doesn't always ship 
on time.  That's life and it happens everywhere.  

There's no need to broadcast your angst for the list and try to damage the 
reputation of a company which, I think, has made thousands of people 
extremely happy with their service, prices, and shipping.

Ron, your doing a great job, keep it up!
