Subject: Oil pressure senders ?

Hi !

I have an oil leak coming from the oil pressure switch. By the way of 
replacing this oil pressure swith, i would like to put a VDO oil pressure 
sender and a VDO gauge. I want tot put a sender who can light the 
original oil pressure light in the dash.

I am looking in the Rocky Moutain Motorworks catalog and there is two 
types of oil senders , 80 and 150 PSI. Which one do I need ?

There is also a &quot;T-Adapter&quot; Did i need it on my 2000 engine ?

Thank you for your help :-)
