&gt; Hey, guys.  I'm facing this swap.  Just looked in
&gt; the library (nice article Jim!) and searched post
&gt; posts.  Just wondering if anyone can tell me
&gt; which alternator kits currently available have
&gt; the best fitting parts, have the best directions,
&gt; and are the most complete.

When I made the switch on Butch I got the full kit from aircooled_dot_net.
It came with everything I needed including the tin pieces for the fan
shroud. Was a genuine Bosch unit to boot. The carb accel linkage is
the only thing I had trouble with. I had didn't have the linkage from
the beetle for the alt so I had to just bend the snot out of it. got
it working, but having the correct linkage would have been nice. This
was on a Pict34
