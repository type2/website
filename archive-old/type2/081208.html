&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fitting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the end thus it wouldn't hook up to to the terminal on the ring
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;main.  Not deterred and after seriously considering cutting
&gt; &gt; &gt; off the end
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at
&gt; &gt; &gt; least something
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the 30-34 psi range
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I figured it would read at least a couple of PSI since fuel is coming
out...
&gt;
&gt; one would think so, however no fuel can escape while testing since it
&gt; would not be able to produce presure (you knew that)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; was gonna answer more of your questions but got tired of manually
&gt; &gt; &gt; formatting your original message, turn on your word wrap and set it at
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 74 or so then repost and I'll answer the rest of your
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry.  We've been forced to switch to Outlook at work (no way to set
&gt; &gt; word-wrap for some reason.)  The post was sent from home using the
&gt; &gt; Outlook Web Access, also no settings for word wrap, I'll repost later
&gt;
&gt; there is a way to do it in OE, trying to remember how I was told.  will
&gt; look it up if I can but it can be done, just well hidden
