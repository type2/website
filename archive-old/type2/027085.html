Unfortunatly I live in Minnesota, although I am planning a backpacking trip 
to Olympic NP this summer...Can't wait for that.  Anyway, so far just about 
everyone that has responded has told me to start the hunt for a new
transmission.  But I am still a little confused about what is the best 
rought to go.  I live in Minneapolis/St.Paul area and am aparently in the
hunt for a good autotransmission.  Anyone that knows where I can get one, or 
has another idea about what I should do please let me know.

Thanks for the help!
Adam

&gt;It sounds like you need a new trans. Like someone else said, get the Gov
&gt;shift,
&gt;not the vacuum shift.
