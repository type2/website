Subject: Squeaky wheel

Hi,

Just wondering how much I need to think about it,

I have a 71 camper with a squeaky rear (I think) wheel which seems to get 
louder the longer the trip.  but it stops when I apply the breaks very 
lightly.

Can this be written off as dirty brake pads or is it more the wheel 
bearings...?  How do I know...the fact it seems to get louder as the trip 
goes on makes me think I need to get in there and grease something...but i'm 
clueless.

Planning a trip to the Eastern Oregon Desert next weekend and want to get 
any 'might be' problems taken care of.

Thanks,
Kim
