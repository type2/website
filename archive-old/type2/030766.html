I got my '77 in December, and the PO told me that she never used the
washer fluid because it was too much of a pain. I like having it, so the
first time I took her to a gas station I bought washer fluid and then
presurized the tank, only to be sprayed from the bootom of the steering
column. Anybody have advice on how to fix this. I checked the archives but
didn't find much that was helpfull.

Thanks,
Nick
