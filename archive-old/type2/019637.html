 The emergency brake sticks a lot, but reading the archives indicates this is
fairly common in wet weather.

Not if things are &quot;right&quot;, in my opinion.

&gt; I have recently replaced the left rear wheel cylinder because it leaked

Usually, one side locks because the other side does not.  If every thing is
equal, both will lock at the same time.  Look at the brake lines.  The left and
right rear brakes tee from a single brake line from the master cylinder.  At
some point, for what ever reason, you will have equal pressure to both left and
right wheel cylinders, since you've already replaced both hoses.

I would look at both rear brakes to determine what is happening differently.
Did you lube the metal to metal contact points?  Are you backing plates worn so
that a groove traps the brake shoe?  Are your parking brake cables free and
lubed in their housings?  Are both brakes adjusted?

So many questions, when you wanted answers.

Mike D.
