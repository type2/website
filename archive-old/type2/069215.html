Volkswagen built a Kombi, Westfalia Werke turned it into a 
Campmobile.

Why don't you try telling the insurance company that you have
one of THOSE HIPPIE BUSSES.  You know, the kind that KIDS
drive from coast to coast following some ACID ROCK band, and
sleeping in it using a PORTABLE PROPANE STOVE for heat.

I think they'd probably negotiate a different rate................8 )
