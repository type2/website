Subject: Re: [T2] Power Surge

Frank,

Yep, Could be almost anything.

From a loose 12v feed wire to the coil to a loose/corroded
grounds or feed wire to an injector.

Richard has great shots of the ground block forthe injectors under the 
plenum....basically go thru *all* electrical from the front to the back 
and re-tighten, clean and make sure connectors are good.

Don't forget the fuses and fuse box in the front!  and your ignition 
switch...maybe you are bumping the wire that feed 12v to the coil
from the front of the bus...

cut-off on bumps?..or just anytime...at speed?..any speed?

Maximum cut out?...like no cylinders, or just one cylinder going off line.
Bad distributor cap?...bad plug wire that is rubbing thu to ground out 
someplace everyonce in awhile?

Bad spark plug resistor/connector...I had one die just a few weeks ago on 
the road and it would idle and run, but just not as good as it 
should....turns out the internal &quot;carbon&quot; stuff in the connector had 
broken.

Talk to us!!!

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hi everyone, HapyFriday to ya!!
&gt; 
&gt; I am experiencing a power surge.  I feel a slight cut off / cut out every so
&gt; often.  Originally thought I was out of gas.  Nope!  Then the battery was
&gt; dead.  Replaced.   Still a surge.  I am planning to switch the coil.  For some
&gt; reason I think that is the culprit.
&gt; Could it be the fuel pump?  I suppose it could be anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Your thoughts?
