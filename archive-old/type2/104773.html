Subject: Re: [T2] Re: 78t2 4000rpm _at_ 70mph

&gt; This has everything to do with what diameter tires you are running both in the front (for speedo measurement purposes) and in the rear (for the actual
&gt; revolutions per mile). I've driven '70 and '71 Busses for a number of years assuming that 185R14 was the gospel but I recently found that before VW started
&gt; offering radials on new Busses the bias ply tire they used actually had a bigger diameter (fewer revs per mile). During the early days of radials VW
&gt; actually had the bias tire listed as stock for the 'working class' Bus and a radial for the 'luxury class' Bus. Yet, while these 2 versions obviously rolled
&gt; down the road at different revolutions per mile there were no differences between them for the tranny, engine, or speedometer. I came to the conclusion that
&gt; the speedometer on a radial equipped luxury class Bus of that vintage is actually incorrect and when it says you're going 70 you are probably only going
&gt; about 67 AND your engine is spinning higher RPMs to achieve it.  So I went looking for tires that match the diameter of the earlier bias tires (about 26.1
&gt; inches) and ended up with 205/75 14. Now when I go down the highway at 65 I actually blend right in with the traffic and my engine isn't working overtime to
&gt; get there.

Hmm
If I compare a typical 26.1 inch 205 I see 798 revs per mile
and a typical 185/14 at 809 revs per mile

the difference is only .0136 percent which is less than 1 mph difference
at 60 mph.


YMMVS (slightly). There is a pretty wide variance in diameter and revs
per mile even within the same sizes of tires.
