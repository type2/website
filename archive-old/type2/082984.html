Subject: Re: [T2] starting fluid

But what do you suggest for the common shadetree mechanic? I mean for
locating a vacuum leak that you can hear but can't find otherwise.
this old (&amp; I do agree somewhat risky) procedure for finding leaks
works on this:

Engine A runs rough at idle &amp; the owner seems to hear what sounds like
a vacuum leak. He can go through the entire engine replacing fittings
that look questionable, but what of only one is bad, or even worse the
leak is from a recently new fitting/gasket/etc. Owner A (who owns
Engine A) sprays a small amount of starter fluid in a few areas on the
running motor. The engine speed increases when he sprays in a
particular area. This is an easy way for him to see that, yes he has a
leak &amp; hopefully help him diagnose what parts to replace/tighten. I
don't subscribe to using starter fluid to make a car start. There is
something very wrong w/ a gas engine that needs that (i.e. it needs
real attention, not just a quick fix). Keep in mind that the engine w/
a vacuum leak is actually not running correctly. It's sucking in extra
air that the fuel delivery system isn't accounting for &amp; the engine
will run hotter. Spraying the fluid at these leaks only serves to help
temporarily richen the mixture &amp; make a noticable difference for the
owner to diagnose the leak.
