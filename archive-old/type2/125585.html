Subject: Re: [T2] No highbeams

State inspection is coming up and my high beams won't go off.  I looked 
at the turn signal switch and saw that two brown wires have pulled off 
the switch.  This is on a '71 bus.  I looked at the wire diagram and it 
looks like  a single wire goes to the high-low beam relay.  Is there 
any way I can bypass the switching of high to low from the turn signal 
switch?

Joy thru air,
Jamie Auch


I don't know if you've already resolved this issue as you posted a week 
ago, but I went through this today.  The brights on my '71 were stuck 
on ever since I got it a couple years ago.  Today, I pulled the relay 
(It's the one on the right side of the fuse box with 5 plugs).  I 
forced the cover off with a flat head screwdriver.  When the cover is 
off, note exactly which way the relay is set.  Push down on the top and 
you'll see the relay switch to the other setting.  It's actually pretty 
interesting to see how it works.  After you've switched the relay, put 
the cover back on (you may have to bend the edges of the cover a bit to 
get it back into place).  Plug the relay back into the fuse box and you 
should have your headlights now stuck in with the low-beams on.

At some point, I may actually replace the relay.
