Well after inspection, replacement, and testing of the wheel cylinder the brakes are working for now. 
After reading your replies to my previous notes to the list.  I took a closer look at the brake shoes and agree that the too need to be replaced.  
Money is low but I possibly can scrap up some to at least get one set.  Payday is around the corner and I'm planning to inspect and possibly replace all the shoes.   I currently have two sets for the front that I've been storing for awhile.  
After adjusting the brakes I did notice that the hand brake is catching the wheels alot sooner than before.  I assume another sign that the brakes need attention.  
 
I'm kinda nervious to take her out on the real roads because of what I experienced yesterday.
 
Thanks....
 
Michael
