Below the heater controls on Ramona's dash, there is a red
plasticround button-esque light that, when depressed, goes lit red.
There is a &quot;B&quot;in the center etched in white.

I've always kown it as a 'Human Tester'. They've got 'em in MGs too.
Actually it's a brake tester that I've never found to work, except in
my old '67 Kombi.
