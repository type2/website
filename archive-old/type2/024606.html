&lt;&lt; Type 2 - Transporter, Bus, Camper
     T1 - Splitty (1st generation, 1950-67)
          [uses Type 1 engine]
     T2 - Bay(window) or (bread)loaf (2nd gen., 1968-79)
          [uses either Type 1 or Type 4 engine]
     T3 - Vanagon or Wedge (3rd gen., 1980-90 (92))
          [uses either Type 4 or watercooled engine]
     T4 - Eurovan (4th gen., 1991-today)
          [uses watercooled engine] &gt;&gt;

You may be right on the money, but if you call to order parts or accessories
from any after-market supplier in Europe, I suspect they won't know what a T3
is.  All of my parts and accessory catalogs list the Vanagon as a T2, and the
Eurovan as a T4.  They usually further give the years to not confuse the
Vanagon T2 with the Bus T2.
