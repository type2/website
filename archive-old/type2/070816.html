 If you love your bus, keep your engine well-maintained, and you'll never

 to know your oil temp.!!!!

no chris you've got it wrong...what you need to do is take out the cooling 
system vw designed.  and THEN  add gauges to monitor when your engine will 
explode....

all you need to do is think about it a little while and it'll all come clear 
to you!!!  ha ha these people crack me up when they justify pulling out 
cooling flaps...oh well every one has an opinion...this one is mine.
