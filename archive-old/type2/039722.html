Crow  (and list):

The behind your head ac unit is very nice for pulling out all of the &quot;guts&quot;
and then using to mount a CD player and speakers in.  (Speakers right up near
your head)  Probably I'll eventually find some other uses for all that
mounting space up there.  8^)

&gt; happy Friday all,
&gt;  I was in the pick a part junk yard (Hayward CA)
&gt;  there were two busses with ac units or consoles.
&gt;  a 72 with an over head console unit.
&gt; that goes behind your head.
&gt;  and a 77 with an under the dash unit.
&gt;  the 77 is a westy and has most of the bed pads
&gt;  there's 1 westy window (I have the other)
&gt; the z-bed is in nice shape.
&gt; hope some one can use the info.
&gt;  have you hugged your VW to day
