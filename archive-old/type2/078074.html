&gt;&gt; 3.  Any tips on getting the big circlip out from the inner bearing?

&gt;Big snap ring tool.  No substitute for proper tools.  You don't have to
&gt;pay Snap-on prices, but get the right one!

Check sears_dot_com for &quot;snap ring&quot;.  I managed to do mine with their cheap $10.99 one, reversing the tips so the fat ends went into the ring eyes.  George is right: 
correct tool improves busma.  But with the cheap one and a couple of screwdrivers I was able to get it out and in, both sides, on my '71.

Biggest PITA was that, with no space behind the ring eyes, you're _just_ barely gripping it and the ring tends to pop off at the exact moment it looks like it will come 
out.  Thus the screwdrivers.
