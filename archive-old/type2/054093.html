Subject: Re: Wanted to Buy: rebuilt 205S dizzy

John,
I had a 76 Westy with a stuck plate.  Caused some really nasty fuel
milage.  Fixing it is really not that difficult.

I will try and do this by memory.  Take off the all the screws on the
upper part of the distributor.  You can take off the clips too.

LABEL WHERE ALL THE SCREWS CAME FROM AND THE ORIENTATION OF THE BREAKER
PLATE WITH RESPECT TO THE HOUSING OF THE DISTRIBUTOR!!

Then, take off the points, condensor, everything, including the vacuum
advance.  Make sure that you're careful taking off the C clip that holds
on the vacuum advance arm.  Then, the tricky part is gettin the breaker
plate out.  If you notice, there are grooves pressed into the sides of
the distributor at same height that the plate is resting.  What you have
to do is rotate the plate(the whole thing) I believe clockwise looking
at it from the top.  You will notice that the screws are what held the
plate from turning.  You might want to spray some lubricant/degreaser to
help it spin.

You will only need to spin it about half a centimeter or so and it will
then allow you to lift the plate past the grooves sticking out of the
distributor walls.  You will be then holding the breaker plate which
consists of two plates held together by a clip.  Carefully take that
clip off, being careful not to lose the ball, clip, or an eye.  Then,
you can rotate the TOP plate until the groove, opposite of where the
wire is, matches up to allow you to lift the TOP plate away from the
BOTTOM PLATE.

BE EXTREMEMLY CAREFUL HERE!!! THERE ARE LITTLE PLASTIC PIECES(3) THAT
KEEP THE TWO PLATES FROM RUBBING AGAINST EACH OTHER.  These little black
peices are about 1mm in diameter and and pushed in from the bottom of
the TOP plate.  I lost mine and had to go to a shop and pull apart some
old plates to get one.  You can press them out from the top.(I recommend
it).  Set those aside.

Then, clean all the parts thoroughly in carb cleaner or mineral
spirits.  Mineral spirits gets it nice and clean :)  I would be weary to
clean the distributor housing unless you want to reoil the main shaft. 
Probably a good idea, though.

Get those plates real clean, and set them aside.  Take a look at the
inside of the distributor and make sure that all the springs and c clips
on the centrifugal advance are in place.  When you hold the bottom
shaft, you should be able to spin the top shaft and have it turn
slightly.  You will notice that the weights will swing out when you spin
the top shaft(holding the bottom shaft).  Also, make sure that the
weights are spinning nice on their axes.  If there is any binding, add
some oil here and grease underneath them.  Not too much, or it'll all
spray out when the thing starts spinnin fast.  Also, be sure to add a
drop or two of oil to that little felt thing in the top of the shaft.

Now, take the plates, put those plastic thingies back in, apply a good
amount of grease to the round part(top middle of bottom plate, bottom
middle of top plate), the places where the plastic things contact the
bottom plate, and put the two halves back together matching up the
little notches.  Then, apply some grease to your cleaned ball and clip
and clip that back on.  Now, test out your breaker plate and it should
spin nice and smooth.  You'll feel really proud too that you got
something that didn't move at all to be smooth as chocolate :)

Then, to put the breaker plate back in, match it up the same way it came
out.  Be sure to get it in the right slots of the distributor or it will
fall into the distributor.  A little examination of the insides of the
distributor housing will help make more sense of the grooes.  Line it
up, get it in place, and spin it counter clockwise until the screw holes
match up.  Screw all the screws back in place, put the points in, apply
some grease to the main shaft(where the points contact it), and you
should be back in business.

Hopefully, I didn't forget anything.  If I did, I'm sure you will figure
it out when you do it.  If you have any problems, just send me an email.

Later,
Mike

&gt; Hey there Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having a problem with my 022-905-205S dizzy (aka 0231-170-093),
&gt; and although I intend to rebuild the upper end (thanks for the tips
&gt; Steve), I'm wondering if someone can direct me to a source of a
&gt; rebuilt one. This dizzy came stock on 76-78, and 79 FED 2.0L type2's.
&gt; 
&gt; For those who are interested, details on this dizzy can be found
&gt; here:
&gt; 
&gt; http://www.c-zone_dot_net/jim96003/oldvolkshome/ignition.htm#B7679
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard rebuilt dizzys can be bought for $90, but I can't find
&gt; one. The local VWFLAPS say new _at_ $400, (busdepot has 'em for $338 new
&gt; - no rebuilt ones), so I'm hoping I can get a rebuilt one.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to put a rebuilt in there for now, so I can drive the bus
&gt; while I play with the old dizzy. If I can somehow take the original
&gt; apart, clean and grease it, *and* put it back together correctly,
&gt; I'll have a spare too. (fyi - points plate is stuck/binding, not the
&gt; vac diaphram leaking).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
