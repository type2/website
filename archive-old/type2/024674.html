&gt; Bob Johnson was explaining how to insulate for sound with Q - pads.
&gt; Where can I get them and how much do they cost ?

I've seen this thread a couple of times on rec.audio_dot_car as well, and I
thought I would post an alternative to Q-pads and Dynamat that has been
suggested there.  Something that is very similar (if not identical) in
nature is called Ice-Guard or Ice Dam that is used for roofing.  You can get
this stuff at Home Despot or the like and it is much more economical when
considering the scale of a bus.  About $70 for a huge roll (probably enough
to do 1 1/2 vans).  The people on r.a.c. claim that it smells, feels,
applies and works about the same as Dynamat and Q-Pads at a fraction of the
cost.  I cannot vouche for these opinions, but when it comes time to do my
van I'll be going in that direction.

Hope this helps,
N.
