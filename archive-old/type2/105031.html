Subject: Re: [T2] top end update : rebuild?

&gt; Okay - maybe I'm missing something - it's happened before. &lt;grin&gt;

Perhaps the oil is leaking from the rear (fan pulley) oil seal and then just
blowing around over the cylinders? I've had that happen before to me...
drove me nuts because I couldn't figure out where the oil was really coming
from. It was dripping from the cylinder areas and blowing &quot;everywhere&quot; at
highway speeds.
