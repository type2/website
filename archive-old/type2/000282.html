I desperately need the front grill for my '71 bus. The piece that covers the
fresh air vents. If anyone has one that will fit ( I'm not sure which years
are interchangeable) please let me know ASAP and I'll buy it. As my bus is
in the body shop ready to be painted, time is of the essence. As always TIA

Don't take life too seriously- you'll never live through it.
