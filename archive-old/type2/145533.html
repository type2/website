Subject: Re: [T2] Backfiring on decel

All's well.  Replaced the black empi fiberous
looking gaskets with the stock metal ones.  She's
purring now and seems PURRFECTLY balanced.  Not
even the slightest shake to the engine as she
runs.   And the new Sachs TO makes the clutch
feel like butta!  It's a good day to be driving a
volksy.  





Happy bussin'
