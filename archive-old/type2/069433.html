&gt;&gt;Yes, VWoA is lame but lets not compare VW's to the Saturn. Apples to
&gt;&gt;Oranges.
&gt;Has anynoe noticed how hard it is to catch the eye of a front engine Volks 
&gt;driver. All Aircooleds wave. Many other car brand names take at least a look.
&gt;But most front engine Volks avert their eyes like they are embarassed to 
&gt;be seen near one of those old noisy monstrosities, in case someone notices
&gt;it was made by the same company that made their car. I notice this especially
&gt;at stop lights. They sort of shrink down, hoping no one will make the
&gt;connection before the light changes. Of course this doesn't apply to teh old 
&gt;rusty front engines with a group of kids in it who invariably follow you 
&gt;hooting, and honking the horn asking if your van is for sale?

Unfortunately, this is not all true.  I was leaving the Shoreline
Antique
Auto show on this past Sunday, and saw three volkswagens en-route to the
show.  I waved to them all...no responses.  It's not like I'm driving a 
&quot;hate-a-VW&quot; large cadillac or chevrolet, I drive a 91 Jetta.  And I
waved profusely, with no response.  Needless to say, I was bummed.
I hope I get waves when I'm driving my bus....

P.S.  I used to get TONS of waves and thumbs-up when I was driving my
cherry tan '69 bug. But then, that's another story....
