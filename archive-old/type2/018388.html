&gt; By the way, I think that CHT is an ideal candidate for idiot light
&gt; status. Either CHT is 'getting too high' or it's 'okay.' Who cares what
&gt; the actual temp is? (Oil temperature is a different story).

      Not at all. Being able to monitor CHT is just as enlightening as oil
temp. I watch my CHT during my initial warmup to tell me when it gets to 200
so I can drive off, for one thing. And I find it interesting to watch the
changes of CHT and oil temp, like when you come down off the freeway ramp
and the CHT drops and the oil temp goes up.
     Likewise, if I'd payed more attention to CHT, I wouldn't have burnt up
my heads when my fan hub key sheared. I thought at the time that the guage
was going weird, because I couldn't figure out the reason for the higher
temps -- now I know.
      AFAIC, the only use the idiot lights are is to tell me the key is
turned on.
