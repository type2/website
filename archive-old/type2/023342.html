I'd recommend Harbor Freight or Northern Tools.

Both have web sites of the same names.

Remember you get what you pay for.

Might take a visit to a local community college or high school that has a 
body shop course and ask some questions of the instructor and they can help 
you buy something cheap but of reasonable quality. Bring catalogs with you 
and have the pages marked to save time.

I started out with a $50 spray gun and a tankless compressor ($125 maybe? 
mine was a gift) - both Campbell Hausfield - bought at Wal-mart and can 
found at most discount stores like them. It does OKAY but nothing special. 
Good to learn on. As you have a chance to try better equipment you will 
probably want better for your own.

When I need better I borrow a bigger compressor and I have a pair of very 
good siphon guns. The guns do a better job than I could do myself - that is 
to say the flaws in any paint I spray are my fault and not the equipment.
