&gt; &gt; Is it possible to open a rear hatch from the inside of the van, without
&gt; &gt; damaging the door? It's locked with no key in sight.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, remove the panel and you can operate the opening lever and pop the
&gt; hatch.  You can also read the number from the lock and get a key made from
&gt; that.

and by putting a smale hole in the panel and attach something (in my case
some wire ties) to the lever and put a pull on the inside
