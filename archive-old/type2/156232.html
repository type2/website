Hi Mark.  I'm thinking of making a stool that is beefier than the  original, covering it with laminate that matches the cabinets, padding  the top with green plaid, and using it for either a subwoofer box or to  house my ham radio, stereo, etc.  The space inside is way too  valuable to house a trash can.  I'm trying to determine whether I  even need a subwoofer as I'm a jazz musician.  Can't stand that  thump thump rap crap.  I can't make EB this year but maybe I can  make High Country or Naturalbus.  I'll let you know.  If you  found a front curtain for me, I still want it.  Cheers....KR


Hey kevin  Man that is crazy price for a stool.  I like to think  that I am 
the king of stools as I have about 10 of these things and always take  some 
camping with me.  But if they are bring that kind of price I just  might have to 
sell some.  later  mark Dearing   ps  you  coming to everybus?? like jasson 
said  a paint job can wait everybus only  comes once a year. if not everybus try 
 Naturalbus    June  2-4 natural bridge  Virginia
