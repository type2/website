yup

&gt; Fuel: is that injector firing?  check voltage  at the plug, then pull that

swapped plugs with #1

&gt; half of the fuel ring and run it into a pair of cups for a couple seconds.
&gt; Does the cup under #1 have more fuel in it than the cup under #2?

it is missing maybe one fireing in several minutes...

&gt; 
&gt; Air:  Still breathing?  OK, then we have air :-) (sorry, I hadda :-)

snicker snicker
&gt; 
&gt; Compression:  Checked it, yes?

yup  120 on the starter
&gt; 
&gt; Spark: You had a bad plug once, try flopping in another new plug and new
&gt; wire.  If it is another bad plug, tho, then I wonder what is going on in

put in all new plugs this evening, maybe got a bad batch??
got a new wire this evening will put it in the morning

&gt; the ignition.  Something is eating your #2 plugs!  are you burning points?
&gt; replaced your condensor lately?

no points, Pertronix

&gt; As a last resort, take it to a shop and have them pull the muffler and
&gt; put an EGA up the heater box pipe on each side.  See if the exhaust gas on

no heater boxes either

&gt; both sides has the same O2 level.  That will tell you if it is spark plug
&gt; not firing (exhaust will be rich) or if the injector is fouled (exhaust

even easier, can put my hand on the exhaust manifold, try that if it is
running

got a 150 mile drive tommorrow, will find out if this works
