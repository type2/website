&gt;From: Richard Atwell Buses with worse results are still driving down the 
&gt;road but you've got a head replacement in your future.


I figured as much:(.  I just did a valve adjustment III and IV were pretty 
close, very little adjustment, I and II however were both out of wack. I am 
about to head back out and run the test again. I have to keep moving this 
evening with it, we have a HURRICANE coming. I want to start lokking for 
parts while it is raining the next couple of days.
