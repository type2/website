&gt;  yes there is a governor adj, info on how to do it is in the Bentley
&gt; manual, but since it was working fine earlier I would be reluctant to
&gt; touch the gov.
&gt;
&gt; be sure and drain the fluid and clean the filter, again step by step in
&gt; the Bentley manual

Also in the Bentley, there is a procedure for adjusting the bands, which may
also help. On a car that old with that few miles, possibly transmission
conditioner might help too. I don't know the brand (duh!), but I put some
dynamite stuff in a 75 chevy pickup that wouldn't get the 2-3 shift. It's been
4 years and still working fine!
