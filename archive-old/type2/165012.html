Subject: RE: [T2] Bus cover!

&gt; http://busdepot_dot_com/details.jsp?partnumber=A0273

&gt; Ron, would that cover be usable on a bus
&gt;  that has the front spare? 

&gt;My bus has a roof rack, From the look of the pix 
&gt; this cover wouldn't work on mine.  


This cover is a slightly larger than is absolately necessary for a Bus, as
it designed to fit as large as a Vanagon poptop camper. Elastic straps under
the vehicle snug it to fit.  I think it's very likely, although I'm not 150%
sure, that there's enough room for a front spare. (Anyone on the list try
it?)   As for a roof rack, same thing. The cover will accommodate a poptop,
and the roof rack isn't all that much higher, so I think it's likely but I
can't say I've tried it.  I don't know of any Bus covers that are
specifically designed for buses with roof racks and/or front spares.
