&gt; Although you are replacing only one head, you're taking both off,
&gt; right? 

It was suggested that I do so. I'm still pondering whether to simply
replace both heads while the engine is dropped - perhaps I can stave
off disaster for a while with strong heads on both sides. Of course,
it's throwing an extra $200+ at a crappy engine, but may save that
much in towing should the other valves drop, and it seems likely that
they will. I can't believe Bob's post saying that his GEX seized at
3600 miles!! (what was the cause, by the way, Bob?)

I have about $600 available for this repair, and it appears that I may
just be able to fit two heads, as well as the parts, into that budget.

Thanks for all the info. I dig Richard's ratwell_dot_com site - lots of
excellent write-ups!

Cheers,
Mike J.
