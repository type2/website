Subject: My Bus Pics ONLINE (ACS&amp;R)

Hello Volks - Due to the kindness of Steven Dolan, my bus pictures may be 
downed from the following address.  As Steve states, this really is an 
ACS&amp;R in operation.  If you don't know what that means, check out the site!

BTW:  Please forgive my appearance.  Thank goodness for me, there are now 
direct shots of my face but on this particular day, I only had one pair 
of overalls left to wear in the dresser (my failure to do the wash) and 
so I had to put on these tight revealing things.  I ain't no fit and trim 
prince charming therefore, I wore my shirt (from when I worked at the 
factory) over the apparel of which I was ashamed.  If you can't stand me 
ruining the pictures, then fire up you graphix editor and edit me out - 
I'll thank you for it. :-)
