Subject: Fuel Injection System Cleaning

Hello All,

Thanks to John Baker I now have a complete FI system and I am preparing to 
install it this week. I have been cleaning the various parts and have a 
question. No I am not going to be using Sea Foam on this one. The harness 
has a lot of Guck around it and I want to know what others may have used to 
clean it. I don't want to corrode it, or melt the wire casings. Would this 
be a place for mild soap and warm water? Water a bad idea? Simple Green, 
Purple Power, Clorox? TIA.

TravelOn,

Michael Knight
