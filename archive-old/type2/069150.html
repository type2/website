Subject: Re: Help w/pilot bearing removal

Peter:

You'll need to get a hold of a small enough puller to get that bearing
out.  I did the same thing you did several years ago whild doing a
clutch job (i.e., bending the outer lip of the bearing) but I was lucky
and my neighbor had a puller small enough for the job.  (That said, I
do remember reading about another way of removing the bearing:  Pack the
bearing and the hole it resides in full of grease, then fit a dowel which
_just_ fits inside the bearing into the hole.  Smack the end of the dowel
with a hammer and hydrolic pressure pops out the bearing!  No guarantees,
but it just might work!)

As I recall, the felt washer goes on the _other_ side of the flywheel.

&gt; Hi all:
&gt; 
&gt; I still have the engine out of my '74 bus.  I now have all the parts I
&gt; need to put it back it (clutch stuff), and since I have the whole week
&gt; off from school (WSU), I'm gonna do it this week.
&gt; 
&gt; I am having a real hard time getting the pilot bearing out.  I have
&gt; managed to break off the front (outer) lip of the bearing in trying to
&gt; pry it out with some pliers.  I have gone around to all the hardware
&gt; stores in town to find a bearing puller, but all they have are bigger
&gt; ones, the pull teeth will not fit in such a small hole.
&gt; 
&gt; So, any suggestions will be helpful.  Also, when I ordered the pilot
&gt; bearing, it came with a little felt ring.  The old one had no felt
&gt; ring with it, so I don't know where it goes in it.  Any help will be
&gt; most appreciated.   
&gt; 
&gt; PETE
