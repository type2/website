Subject: Re: Finding TDC

Hi Volks

Something I did to make sure I was at TDC at each cylinder
for valve adjustments, was to make myself a visual aid. Took an 
old distributor cap and cut off the top. What I ended up with is the
bottom of the cap which looks like an open pipe. When this is installed on
the
distributor, it is easy to sanity check the rotor position in relation
to each cylinders firing position.
