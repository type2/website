 &gt;&gt;These has been some postings on Ebay for sale of some 'blue hose' 
that connects the brake fluid reservoir to the master cylinder .
7mm, part number N 20 350 1
What gives??&lt;&lt;

this strange blue hose was on the 73 super beetle i used to have &amp; 
appeared to be factory. when replacing it, i took it to my local VW 
FLAPS &amp; they had some in stock.

however, on the 74 bus i used to have, when i changed out the MC, it 
did _not_ use the blue hose, but rather a firm plastic non-flexible 
length of hose to connect the fluid reservoir &amp; the MC.

hope that answers your question,
