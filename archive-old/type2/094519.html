Subject: Re: [T2] 1979 CAMPER 2.0L 

Quoted from bentley 1968 - 1979 service manual...&quot;On 1976 vehicles 
manufactured from Feb 76 the need for the throttle valve switch was 
eliminated by changing to a mechanically controled EGR valve. An 
ordinary microswitch was subsequently installed on the throttle valve 
housing to take over the full load/full throttle enrichment function 
that had formerly been handled by the throttle valve switch.  1977 and 
later models have neither a throttle valve switch nor a microswitch. &quot; 
Section 10 page 10 para 4.6 (hmm looks like a bible quote)

&gt; This is more an oberservation really . I have a HAYNES manual and the

&gt; books list two types , one is under the Throttle and one is on top of 
&gt; the
