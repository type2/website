Subject: Re: [T2] How many miles can you get on a tank of gas (fi motor)

And a good question would be - was that figure achieved with US gas or German gas? BMW had problems in the  80's with pinging. Seems they factory tuned (designed the injection sys) with German gas and those engines ran poorly on US gas. These engines ran poorly enough that BMW offered a fix kit (designed in Germany using barrels of American gas) at no cost to keep the customers happy. Seems the difference between our gas and their gas is (for one) a higher level of sulfur in domestic fuel. 

Fuel might be a very different thing now compared to 28 years ago affecting all sorts of variables which affect fuel mileage.
