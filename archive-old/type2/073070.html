&gt;&gt;The finish has been warn away
&gt;&gt;exposing the fibers.  A friend of mine who works on boats for a living told
&gt;&gt;me i can reseal it with a good coat of fiberglass resin.  I am just curious
&gt;&gt;if anyone else has ever had this problem and what did you do to fix it.

Below is a re-post of a good concise Hoover article on this. Full
disclosure, this is a commercial plug: for 818 pages of vintage Bob Hoover

Fovever Poptop

The basic problem with the fiberglas tops I've seen on VW campers appears
to be degredation of the resin due to exposure to ultraviolet light, a common
problem with polyster resins.

If the composite part is to withstand constant exposure to sunlight, as would
be the case with pop-tops -- or airplane wings -- the top surface must
provide a near-perfect barrier to ultraviolet radiation. While there are a num-
ber of UV inhibitors that may be added to the resin, the only proven barrier
I'm familiar with is aluminum.

Adding aluminum in powdered form to the gel coat provides a nearly perfect
UV barrier. Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to work with in hand
lay-ups and repairs.

The aluminum need not be suspended in resin, it may be mixed with regular
paint or varnish. For fabric covered aircraft, powdered aluminum is mixed
with cellulose or butyrate dope. Several coats provide a nice sanding sur-
face with the aluminum powder actng as a lightweight filler. The final color
coats are applied over the aluminum.

Since urethane varnish and enamel will adhere to a well-sanded fiberglas
structure, the procedures above could be used to refurbish a pop-top. The
aluminum filler layers would protect the resin from further degredation and a
top-coat of urethane enamel, which contains its own UV inhibitors, would
provide the slick 'wet-look' finish that does such a good job of cutting down
solar insolation.

Powdered aluminum is available from most good paint stores. It is used on
canvas (boats) as well as aircraft and may be found at some marine supply
outlets.
