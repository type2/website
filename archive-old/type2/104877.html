Subject: Re: [T2] singleport doghouse pix

&gt;  This was one of the easiest 'modified' engines I've worked with, all
 parts just bolted into place and I didn't have to reengineer anything.

Dave,

What did you do with the rod between the right flap and the thermostat?

I never could get it to work. The arm hole on doghouse flaps and the rod hole in single port heads do not line
up.
