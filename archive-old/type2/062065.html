&gt;Do the Dormobile tops and beds show up in junkyards?

Hey if they do somebody please tell me! I am looking for one for a split!

I bet it would be a
&gt;bitch to have one shipped over, but I really like those tops. There was a
&gt;Dormobile top loose here back around...March, wasn't it?

THERE WAS AND I MISSED IT?

 Somebody else must
&gt;remember that...but it was snapped right up.

i would like to find a dorm roof for my split if anybody happens to know of one?

michael
