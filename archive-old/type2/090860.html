the &quot;Red Car&quot; system. I remember it very well, even though I was very
little then.

The nostalgia of days gone by is in the minds of many.
I too remember the electric trolley cars from the early 00s to late 50s
and I used them as a child to get around to music lessons, go to the
public swimming pools etc.
The cars from Dallas were sold to Portugal in about 1956 and several were
brought back in 1998, refurbished and put into service at the same
locations the operated on in the 20s and 50s.
I was in a local machine shop where the gear boxes and electric motors
were being rebuilt and the shop owner commented that he had serviced the
same components on many of the same cars as a young man in the shop
before he bought the shop years later.
He commented on the quality of the electric motors and drives making
particular emphasis on the fact that Portugal had run the cars for 40+
years after they bought them from the City Transit Company and the
components were still in remarkable good condition after nearly 100 years
of use.
