Hey Danial. 

Hey Brother..all I can say is welcome to the &quot;family&quot;. I share your joy. I too wont forget my first go around the block or the first real camping trip. You are going to enjoy the ride!

Can I ask where you got your twin carbs and was it a big job converting back from the single set up? I have been asking around but have been told that the parts are almost imposible to find. Not really the carbs but little parts like throttle arms and such. I want to convert back to the twin set up BAD!!

I am going to check yet another place this week.

Peace
