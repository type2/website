Subject: [T2] Points Metal Deposition, matching Coil &amp; Condensor

The T2 list has repeatedly rejected my attempt to
respond, saying excessive quoted material.  What
quoted material?
     
If I remember correctly, by failing to match condensor
to coil, the points begin a pattern of metal
deposition from one point to the other, depending upon
the micro-farad rating of the condensor.   I am not
seeing any metal deposition in either direction.  I am
however, seeing significant cap / rotor oxide
build-up.
    
The bus currently sits in an &lt;&lt;early failure mode.&gt;&gt; 
I'm not beyond taking the bus to someone local for
expert eyes to view and diagnose.
