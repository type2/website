&gt; Thom's the man when it comes to doing his barndoor right.  Removing 
&gt; _ALL_ the rust, fabbing frame pieces, all that stuff that really 
&gt; needs to be done.

While I'm flattered that y'all think I'm doing a good job on the 
barndoor, I still don't think I'm doing it 100% right.  Instead
of fabbing pieces, I should be scouring for NOS pieces or cutting
up another non-so-rusty bus.  I didn't wanna go that route, A) the
cost would be prohibitive for the NOS stuff, and B) I don't
wanna cut up another barndoor if I don't have to.
