Well, I did my first partial tune-up!  Gretel, my poor german pack mule, was
having a real bad time, at stop lights he'd idle down, oil pressure light 
blinking furiously, until she shut off (shaking and shimmying the whole while) 
and she had NO power.  

I bought some diagnostic equipment, and set my valves (.006&quot;), my timing (7.5 
degrees BTDC ('77 FI camper)) and my idle (850 rpm's), and now, joy of joy's, 
it's like she's been reborn! I can't believe how much power there seems to be 
now..  it feels like a v8!  Unfortunately, now I'm running into new problems.

Old Gretel has always had an exhaust leak, and she eats a lot of oil.  The 
problem is, today driving to work, and riding at 55 for a while, caused a LOT
of white smoke to emanate from the fan housing when I stopped.  Also some
white smoke appeared to be coming from the large square part of the engine that
the coil is mounted on.  I havne't figured out what this is called yet, but
it's the big lumpy square right to the left of the fan housing.  Am I just 
burning off oil that got splashed around when she was running poorly (and
cooler, I'm guessing?) or is something else possibly wrong?  Any advice in
this regard would help a lot, especially whether I should stop driving it
until I get this new problem fixed.

Thanks a lot!
