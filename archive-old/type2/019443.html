&gt; Hi,

The purpose of the Idle jet cutoff solenoid in later carbs (68 and newer
mostly)  was to shut down the engine without running on or dieseling after
turning off the ignition.  This solenoid was neccessary due to the lean idle
mixture and high idle speeds required to meet emmissions standards.  Earlier
engines used a richer mixture and a lower idle speed and got by just fine with
the idle jet you have on your carbs.  I have 73 and 74 carb setups and 76 and
79 fuel injection setups.  The stock 73 and 74 carbs have one solenoid on the
right carb and two on the left. The #55 indicates the jet's size. I have
successfully replaced idle solenoids in single carb engines but haven't tried
it on the type 4.

Good luck and e-mail me for further details.

Keep smiling,

Mike

&gt;
&gt; On the old carb (which I have right here) there is in that place what looks
&gt; like a jet with a BB jammed in it (&quot;0(8?)55 Solex&quot; -- the slot's kinda
&gt; mangled, so it's hard to read that first number). I just looked at the
&gt; &quot;new&quot; carb, and it's got something similar in that spot, too. What gives?
&gt;
&gt; Nikki
