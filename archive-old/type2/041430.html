Subject: alternator question

I'm looking for advice here.  '79 stock cal spec westy.

I just had my alternator rebuilt since it had some miles and I had the
engine out anyway for a rebuild.  Now by rebuilt, I mean I took the
alternator to the local reputable auto-electric shop and requested that it
be checked out, new bearings and brushes installed and whatever else might
be needed, even though it worked fine before I took it in.  After
installing the new engine, everything was fine for the first 300 miles
until taking a 100 mile road trip, when the alternator and OXS light came
on when I was cruising steady at 60 mph.  I pulled over and could find
nothing wrong, but the lights were gone when I restarted.  I completed my
trip, but now a couple of days later, the battery and OXS light are on
again and seem to stay on.  I've tried installing a different known good
voltage regulator, with no apparent effect.  I can't locate any obvious
wiring fault.

Is there a way to test alternator function while the alternator is in the
car?  I need to get to the bottom of this ASAP since I plan a long vacation
trip in a week.  Please respond to the list or pmail me at
multipang_at_kconline_dot_com.  Any help is appreciated.
