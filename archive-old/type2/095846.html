Set my timing with a light while running, no vacumn lines.  set it to 7.5

Is the timing more a function of the disti, or the engine?  The disti lookup
says 7.5 BTDC for my disti, my friend with the same type of engine says TDC,
and my father says &quot;just do it by ear&quot;

Timing too far one way or another?

couldn't dial it in, couldn't dial it in....couldn't get the idle high
&gt;enough, carb adjustments did nothing.  I figure its a worn throttle plate
or
&gt;bad carb so I buy a new 34PICT3/4 from the local VW shop.
