I strongly concur with Ron Salmon. Make sure you have someone with lots
of VW experience look over (or even install it for you) to vouch for its
correct installation and startup. I got a longblock for my 81 Vanagon
one year from GEX and had problems under warranty. In order to have it
replaced they had to speak with my mechanic and have him vouch for
everything. I don't know what they would do if you installed it
yourself... I personally think coorespondence directly with the
President of GEX and this newsgroup helped my cause.
        Because of their honoring their warranty - it only cost me time, and
some labor (they didn't cover it all) costs. Now, knock on aluminum, my
replacement GEX 2.0 liter is working great so far and has 4,000 miles on
it). I will forward my communication with GEX and story I posted to the
Vanagon list a few months back to you Beth (and anybody else if they
request it). Good luck,

&gt; &gt; negative comments about GEX engines, and now I'm VERY nervous.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What can I do during the build up and reinstallation of the engine to
&gt; &gt; protect myself if I got a lemon?  I'm doing the work myself, reading
&gt; &gt; the Clymer manual carefully, and also reading the Bentley manual.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've pulled the engine on the van twice, once to redo the clutch,
&gt; &gt; once to redo the heads, so I'm fairly confident I know how to remove
&gt; &gt; and re-install the engine properly, but what constitutes &quot;proper&quot;
&gt; &gt; installation from the standpoint of the GEX warranty?

&gt; &gt;From my (absolutely horrible) experience with GEX, should you have a
&gt; problem they are likely to claim that the engine was overheated, and thus
&gt; the warranty is void.  Besides taking the obvious steps to avoid
&gt; overheating the motor (which include proper installation of motor and
&gt; ancilliary items, use of proper oil, etc. - see Bentley and Muir), I would
&gt; carefully document EVERY oil change, etc.  I would also have a local VW
&gt; specialist inspect the installation and put in writing that everything that
&gt; could affect overheating (engine tin, timing, cooling etc.) is within
&gt; factory spec.  The existence of such documentation protected me when GEX
&gt; hassled me about warranting an engine that was clearly defective from day
&gt; one.
