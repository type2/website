Subject: Re: [T2] wayward gears

Hi Greg,

Yes this could definitly be caused by excessive wear to the stop plate (especialy as you have removed more common causes by replacing the front bushing and rear connector).
The best soloution would be to get a replacement stop plate, second best would be to apply a bead of weld into the gouges and then to file flat with the underside and vertical face, remembering to shape it slightly upwards at the front to allow the stick to go into reverse.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I replaced the front shift rod bushing and the rear coupling in my 74 
&gt; single cab..(old ones worn out), haven't replaced the two rear shift rod 
&gt; bushings yet,  Occasionally, when downshifting from 3rd to second, the 
&gt; truck sometimes wants to go in reverse!  What could be causing this?  I've 
&gt; noticed that you don't have to push the shift lever down into the floor to 
&gt; get it in reverse, just pull it hard toward you.  I've also noticed, that 
&gt; the stop plate under the shift rod mount has a LOT of wear on the little 
&gt; portion of it that protrudes up toward the right front of the truck.  Could 
&gt; that be causing it?  I'm getting real frustrated with sloppy shifting.  TX!
