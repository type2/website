Best way is just to take it with you when you visit a regular toilet.
Dumping the whole thing down the loo and then flushing takes exactly as
much water as when you simply do your business.  Be sure to clean up any
splashes, so as to be a good citizen!

On this topic, I rue the day I swapped a portapotti-equipped vehicle for
another &quot;self-contained&quot; one.  Finding a dump station is so much harder
than simply finding a toilet, and the cleanout is harder as well!
