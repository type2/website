Subject: Re: [T2] Drive it really far, it just might make it

In approximately seven years I drove my Westy 145K.
Most trips were 250 mile camping turnarounds.
Several (more than 10) trips were in excess of 3000 miles.
Driving the distances is more a matter of just getting in and doing it.
Many VW repairs can be just a matter of a few minutes down town if you
have the simple parts required.
My Westy is an 83 and I can safely run 70 mph all day when winds and
temperatures are moderate but I meet many people with Bays and Splits
that are locked into the 60-65 mph range. These folks make equally long
trips successfully simply because they read their conditions and don't
overstress their vehicles.
I'm not discounting the condition of the vehicle but if you're proud of
your Westy or Van, more than likely its in good enough condition to make
the trips you want.
If your vehicle is displaying tell tale signs of poor performance, fix it
before the trip.
AAA is good trip insurance for those that are interested, the AIRS road
support group is good insurance and common sense driving is good
insurance.
With older vehicles there is always a slight chance that some obscure
part will fail when it is *put to the test*, but most parts fail slowly
and you'll have warning signs before disaster happens.
Get out there and make those trips in your Vans.

In a recent post you said........People, take your bus out on the road.
Drive it really far, it just might make it
And not only do we use our bus for trips, we use it as a daily
driver too, day in and day out.
