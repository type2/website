Subject: Re: Gas valve / regulator -CHANGES COMING

A good bet for gas valve/regulator/hoses etc. is your local gas company, or 
bottled gas distributor. Also, have you got a gas appliance repair shop 
nearby?He may be a few bucks cheaper. HOWEVER    Regulations governing gas 
bottles and fittings have changed recently, as a look at the new bottles at 
Home Depot will readily prove.[New fittings are externally threaded, and 
larger-easier to attach, somewhat more fool-proof] You may wish to consider a 
new tank, or a new fitting installed with the new valve, because one day 
soon, they won't be filling the old bottles anymore.Peoples Gas is already 
refusing to fill my old bottles, and as they run dry, they are  trash. Clock 
is ticking.  So the guys at Peoples Gas here in St. Pete tell me.This could 
be a major pain for you Westy owners, and I think you oughta look into this. 
The huge numbers of new grills and bottles being sold all have the new 
coupling setup, and all the gas guys are switching over.The gas dock here is 
full of old-style-valve castoff bottles, some almost brand new. Bummer, huh?
