&gt; Thanks.

Since Mexican buses have been made with golf engines, and there is a
diesel version of the golf out there, I suppose that it is possible.
There was also a diesel vanagon, which was probably the slowest type 2
made.

Anything can be done with enough money.  A TDI diesel in a baywindow would
probably be a hoot!
