This from a guy down the street whose bus I have admired from afar:

	Asking Price:   $3,500
                 Original Factory: Interior (brown vinyl)
                                   Exterior (white over yellow)

                 70,000 miles on Re-built engine
                 Recent brakes and clutch cable replacement
                 New Tires and good spare
                 Passed Smog Test (1999 to 2001)
                 Sunroof in working condition
                 Same owner since 1984

	Inquiries:     indianrock_at_hotmail_dot_com

I will add:

This bus is immaculate.  He claims it is factory paint, and if so it is
amazing.  Based on his other vehicles, it may be.  He takes very good care
of his equipment.  This is just a bus with the two bench seats, no camping
equipment.  The engine compartment is clean, all the components are there
and in working order (including blower system for heat).  The interior is
beautiful and all original square weave vinyl except for driver's seat which
has a very good match to the original vinyl.  If I didn't already have a '76
of the same colour, I would jump on this one.  And... he's a really nice guy
to boot.  Please don't let this vehicle go to his teenagers.

Later,
Niall
