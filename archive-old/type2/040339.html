Subject: Charging System Question

Would like some imput on this little problem I'm having with the charging 
sys. in my ' 78 2.0L FI westy. Here's the deal: With low beams on and my 
blower motor going for the heater, my alt light glows slightly. Same with low 
beams(110watt total) and windshield wipers, or low beams and anything else 
for that matter. With high beams, the alt. light glows brighter, and the alt. 
light grows in intensity as eng rpms increase. I replaced the voltage reg. 
with a Hella unit from Ron at the Bus Depot, but it had no effect. During 
daylight use, my voltage is a steady 13.8, but if I add any other electrical 
load, such as headlights, it drops down to 12.3v or lower. The alt. itself is 
of unknown age and dubious origin. y' all think its time to replace that 
puppy, or what?
Thanks,
Parker
