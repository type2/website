Subject: CA Central Valley

Hey All-

I lived a year in Tahoe and 8 months in S.F. and would have to agree
that the cental CA valley is among the most &quot;avoided&quot; areas for
me...That drive from S.F. to Tahoe, even with its short run through Sac
and Davis areas...YUCK!  And north and south  I-5, agreed...but then
just a &quot;short&quot; ways off that road are beauties like Mt. Lassen,
Yosemite, Big Sur...but god how that valley is awful...
