Consider, if you monkey with the arms to make poor fitting blades maybe 
work better, then you will have to monkey with them again if you put a 
proper blade on. You can end up so the right blades don't work and you can 
never get them to work as well as before the tweaking. Rather than bend the 
blades, buy the correct Bosch blades and have proper fit and function with 
no monkey business at all. The value of the poor blades was to get you home 
without a wreak. They were better than nothing by a long shot. That value 
is used up and if it means you have to start jury rigging a fix, that can 
be diminishment of the value of original function. The poor blades will end 
up costing more than the cost of new correct blades. If you do succeed in 
putting more pressure on the stiff blade to make them work better, you put 
that much more strain on the wiper shafts, promoting increased wear. Making 
non-stock parts or accessories fit and work is usually a waste of time that 
can create unforeseen damages. So that's the cost of new proper blades now 
functioning properly, or worn out wiper shafts repair sooner rather than 
later while function remains less than correct even with the tweaking of 
the arms.
