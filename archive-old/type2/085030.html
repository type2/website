Subject: RE: [T2] 72-79 Pressure Plate bolts

Hey Everyone thanks for the help on this issue from before.  And a little
extra information.

Karl is one the money with the 74-75 flywheel having 7mm bolts!  They are
7mm x 1.00 thread x 20mm long.  This also will give you a 11mm head instead
of that cursable triple square [12 point] head.

Why the Bentley does not list it is beyond me.

On the gravytrain to biscuitville!

&gt; Quick simple-ish question here that I really need to know quickly:
&gt;
&gt; What is the size of the pressure plate bolts on the 72-79 flywheel?  The
&gt; Bentley claims M8x20, but that size is not in a format I recognize.
Usually
&gt; it is something like M8 diameter x 1.25 thread x 20mm long.
&gt;
&gt; Any help is greatly appreciated... Trying to get a '74 Westi engine in and
&gt; to Edisto Freeze Yer Toe by midnight tonight :)  I have a side bet with
Dave
&gt; Easterwood for a 6-pack of Guinness that this bus will get there, and I
hate
&gt; to loose bets!

From: Karl [mailto:aufever_at_prodigy_dot_net]

Depends on your flywheel:
72/73 1700 uses a 210mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
74/75 1800 uses a 215mm clutch with 7mm bolts.
76 up 2.0L uses a 228mm clutch with 8mm bolts.
The 8mm bolts are 1.25 pitch. 1.25 is the 'standard' pitch for a 8mm bolt.
That is why the pitch is not given. The 8mm bolt normally uses a 13mm wrench
[Japanese cars use a 12mm wrench].
The 7mm bolts use a 8mm triple square socket.
