Subject: Re: [T2] Firewall removal with engine in.  Can it be done?

Yes - you can remove the firewall with the engine in.

Remember that there are two vertical screws on each side of the engine that 
hold the firewall in in addition to the ones you can see.  I think Bentley 
shows them.

Just remember that a few feet of quality fuel line is  much cheaper than a 
new bus.

Easier too.

&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt;This has been a wonderful summer.  Finally got my bus (1972 Westy,
&gt;1700cc dual solex carb)on the road after redoing the heads and rings and
&gt;stripping out the interior.  My wife and I took it for our first trip
&gt;two days ago and it ran great.
&gt;
&gt;Only problem is it smells like a gas station after filling it up.  I now
&gt;know I should have checked the fuel lines and tank 3 months ago when I
&gt;had the engine out but hindsight is 20-20.
&gt;
&gt;Can I remove the firewall with the engine in?
&gt;
&gt;How hard would this be to do by myself (one person verses a two person
&gt;job)?
&gt;
&gt;How long would it take?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
&gt;Craig
