Subject: Advice for the floor

A couple of days ago we ripped up the carpet in the bus to check out the
floor to see if it had any rust.  The good thing was there was
none....we have some scraps that we are going to use for the new carpet
we are putting down but what is the best thing to put underneath the
carpet?  We thought about plywood, or something along those lines but
don't know if that's the best idea.  Also we want to do some body work
and fix a couple of small holes.  There is one in particular in the
drivers side wheel well and we wanted to know the best way to handle
this one.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated
