Hi Volks!

&gt; &quot;Brake fluids are considered used oil and can be combined with your used

&gt; In australia, it is *not* cool to combine with oil as they say if you are
&gt; going to re-use(re-refine) the oil, it is not good to mix the brake fluid
&gt; in....unless you are just going to burn it.

And that's how it is in Germany.  I have made my usual mistake
of generalizing.  So please check with your local authorities
(which is *not* the guy in the garage -- *they* tell a lot of
nonsense every day, no offence etc. but they do. :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
