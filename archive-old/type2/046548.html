Subject: [T2] Re: Front Axle beams for Bay Window buses.

Volks,

Oh, my, two rusted out beams in one day...  'tis the season, apparently
:-(

On interchangeablitiy:  I *know* that '73-79 beams will all interchange, I
am told that '68-71 beams will interchange, and I *think* that '68-79
beams will interchange.  Having said that, I should also remind everyone
that '68-70 beams, with rare exception are drum brakes, that '71-72 (and
some '73 beams) are one disk system, and that '73-79 are a different disk
system.

My experiences are all with '73-79 late disk brakes.  I know that a '79
beam will fit a '73 body.  I've done it. Beyond that I invite others to
testify.

On installation, there is a whole write up in the library.  I won't repeat
myself :-)  The URL is:

The one addition I would make is that I had some doubt on the heater tube.
On a '73 this is a metal tube and passes over the beam.  On a '78 it is a
paper tube and passes thru the beam.

P.S.: 
Happy New Year!
