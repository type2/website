There is a BN4 installation manual and templates for cutting the needed
holes at http://www.kazmal_dot_net/vwheat/serviceman.html  I believe this is
different than the other manuals because its for a late model BN4 and
includes the templates. Its also not a service manual but an installation
manual.

I
