Subject: [T2] Spare: used or new? Was: Is it feasible with my bus!

A manual tranny halfshaft should be interchangeable to either side, so you
could keep it as a spare.  That's what I would do, since you might get a
great many miles out of a CV joint with intact boots.  You might want to
clean, inspect, and grease the &quot;good&quot; side.  It might last a long time...

If you have an automatic, I don't think the left and right shafts are
interchangeable.
