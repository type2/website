Subject: Re: [T2] There were NEVER any factory ragtop buses

Hi Joe,
Well, I didn't really think you were serious, but hey,
if I wasn't so crazy about VW's I wouldn't have bitten
like that.
I am highly literate myself,having written a number of
short stories &amp; I'm in the final year of completing a
degree that is far more academic than it needs to be
so I understand why you feel like you do about
particular articles.
Yes,their grammar is often reprehensible, but often
they got jobs at a VW magazine because they knew about
VW's, not which word to use in which position in the
sentence.
On this basis I'm prepared to be very forgiving.
You should see guitar magazines.
At least VW magazines give credit where credit's due.
If I read another article in a certain popular guitar
magazine that claims that the current album of drivel
by an obscure artist is the latest in high form music
I'm going to scream!!
They're so busy back patting that they never really
confront whether the music has merit.
They have a lot to answer for....Limp Biskit are
REALLY annoying!!!
Anyway,enough on that subject.
The buses you listed on your email sounded
fascinating.
Do you have any pics of them on the net?
:-)
Cheers
