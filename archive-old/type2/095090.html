Subject: NADA on drugs!


Just found the NADA site.  5000 for good condition, 8500 for high end, and 
3100 for low! What kind of drugs are these people taking? A 69 bus in crap 
condition is worth 3100?  Where do they get these prices?  What planet did 
they take them from? Whose but did they pull these out of? I look at !_at_#_at_!! 
bay almost daily, and am a car trader, and classified ad freak.  Since I was 
8, and I am now 32.  I have very rarely seen a fair bus at 3100.  And if I 
did, it had a hard time selling.  I mean median price on 68-79 is usually 
around 1500.  I did not even pay more than 2000 for my 67 deluxe walkthru 
from Walnut Creek Cali. no rust, or rot, a dual port 1600, and 3/4 original 
rack.  My 71 and 69 eack costed me less than 1000.  MY 71 was a no rust 
westie with 13,000 on the engine.  Needed a little tlc, but decent bus for 
700.  Where do these values come from?    B.G.
