&gt; Hydraulic lifters are a compromise between performance and function. No
&gt; adjustment but as I understand it there is an upper limit before they begin
&gt; to pump up higher than they should and I'll bet the clearances between the
&gt; moving parts within Raby's engines are close enough that they have
&gt; clearance problems with hydraulic cylinders and 8000 rpm (connecting rods
&gt; that grow and lifters that would (if they were hydraulic) pump up).

Exactly. I'm surprised no one has mentioned that there are a/c Porsche
engines that use hydraulic lifters. They have the same problem: good up
until a certain RPM then you need to replace them with solids. I'm sure it's
the exact same problem with the Type IV motor except the lifter design
tolerances along with the stock engine parts limit usage to the lower VW rev
limit of 5,000rpm.

Another issue, it would seem anyway, would be the hassle to the engine
builder of priming up all eight lifters before starting the engine for the
first time. I'm sure it's not as easy as squirting a little oil in the hole
like one does with all the bearing surfaces during assembly. He has to do
one valve adjustment anyway regardless of lifter choice so why not skip the
priming step.

As far as experience goes, think of the cores that he uses to build engines
from. Chances are they aren't good engines to begin with and more often than
not lifters come out in two pieces instead of one because the engine was
abused.
