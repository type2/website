That was exactly the info I was looking for!

The one remaining question it leaves me with is: If the bus is a Westy, does
the rear seat vent and control disappear? This is the one control (and vent
for that matter) that I haven't been able to locate.

The heater box flappers (on/off for all of the heat) are controlled by
the red knob on the dashboard.  Push it down to turn heat on.

Defroster heat is controlled by the lever on the vertical duct under
the dashboard.  Flip it down to direct air to the defroster ducts, up
to direct air to your feet.

Heat for the middle seat (vents on the floor, facing rearward, at
bulkhead) is controlled by the pull knob on the forward side of the
driver's seat pedistal.  Pull the knob to direct heat to the middle
seat, (which reduces heat to the front seats/defrosters)

Heat for the rear seat is controlled at the vents below the rear seat.
Move the knob outboard to turn the heat on, inboard to turn it off.

The heat controls were one of the most-often-changed features of VWs,
bugs and busses included.  Perhaps the factory had a contest to figure
out the most Byzantine control arrangement possible.
