&gt;Could anyone tell me where the step cam to adjust idle rpm when cold

&gt;the side of the carb, but can't seem to find anything like this on my
&gt;PDSIT's to adjust warmitup rpm's.

It is inside the right hand choke cover.  I have a similar looking
mechanism inside the left choke cover also but it doesn't seem to work.
