Since this seems to be my weekend for vacuum problems let me add that your
problem could very well be vacuum as well.  If you don't own a vacuum
guage, go out and get one, they are &lt;$30 at any FLAPS.  The place to apply
it on a late FI bus is the vacuum port on the right side of the air
distribution box... between the runners for cylinders #1 &amp; #2.  If you
don't have that port, then the port for the vacuum advance on your
distributor is fine.  What you want is *at least* 14&quot; of vacuum at idle
(800-1000 RPM).  Anything less points to a vacuum leak and that will cause
you to run lean, eventually overheating the engine. There are lots of
other reasons why a bus overheats. and others have suggested some of them,
but a vacuum leak should also be on your list of things to check.
