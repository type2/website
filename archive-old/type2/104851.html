Subject: Arcomobil / Grawomobil

Hello all-knowing list,

My friend has a rather seldom type of camper. It carries the name Grawomobil
and was made by a small company in southern Germany. This same company made
earlier campers by the name of Arcomobil.

Is there anyone else who can tell us more about these campers and has more
info or photo's of these buses.

He wants to start a website about Arcomobil/Grawomobil so all info is very
welcome.

Greetings from Holland and Belgium,
