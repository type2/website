&gt; well, back before i had done it twice with folks looking over my shoulder.
&gt; since i did by myself, i was bored one day and did the '77s valves again
&gt; AND the '74 again. hehehehe i was REAL bored.
&gt; 
&gt; and if i'm not mistaken, by doing your own valves you can get a better feel
&gt; on how your engine is doing. i'm not sure how you could get a view like this
&gt; with hydraulic lifters.

I get a pretty good idea of how my engine is doing because I seem to end
up fixing it all the timew :)  Don't need any solid lifters to tell me how
she's running.
