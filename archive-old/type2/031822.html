&gt; Here in California I'd say you'd have good luck with that quality/price combination. Saw a sage green for sale as you described a few months back. Don't know about Eastern States, prices probably a lot higher.

right, I was jumping to conclusions not knowing where he is
located... here in the East, lot more humidity and salt on the roads so
rust is the major problem, I feel like I'm in a rust race and it is still
neck in neck.....twice a year a take couple days and do nothing but rust
repair.. last time went through two cyl of gas for my welder.
