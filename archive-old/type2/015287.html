Hi List.
I have a 1776 in a 1970 Campmobile. I have a few questions that I can't
figure out from the archives. 

First the billet oil filler neck needs a fitting (brass is what I'm looking
at for replacement, maybe?) for the air breather box. What size is that
fitting? I don't have a box right now and will buy one soon. Right now that
filler just has the hole for the fitting and nothing else on it so stuff
can get in the case. Not good huh? In the mean time I want to put that
fitting on there so I can attatch a hose to a makeshift breather box type
deal.
Also I have a Solex 34 PICT 3 on right now. On a 1776, is this bad? Will
the bus run hotter? I have a set of dual carbs (Kadrons) Should I put those
on instead? If I do the linkage to the accelerator cable won't let me get a
full range of motion to the pedal. Should I attatch a spring to allow for a
better return?

Please Pmail me at: santose_at_cwu_dot_edu

Thanks so much. With your help my bus Maggie will be on the road again. And
together her and I can conquer THE WORLD! Er... Washington state atleast..
.or not.
