Seriously folks, does this ring a bell with anyone? Now and again nothing
will happen when giving the vanagon gas from idle. It doesn't stall or
stumble, it simply doesn't do anything. Usually if I let up on the pedal and
give it a second we're back in business.

Is this perhaps a symptom of the problem that is fixed by bending the needle
in the airbox? There is never any similar problem while underway, only from
idle and very seldom at that. If it matters, this happens to be an automatic.

Thanks for any ideas; this is a little disconcerting.
