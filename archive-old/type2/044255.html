Randy,

     Glad you got home OK.  I used to carry all kinds of spare parts but
have gotten real slack lately.  I do not even have a spare fan belt.  Thanks
for the story.  Time to get some spares.  BTW,  Did I get to meet you at the
show?  I was the 76 dark blue westy parked on the end by Jim.  Were you the
bright green westy?  This was our first event.  It was great.
