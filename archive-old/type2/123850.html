Subject: eureka / arcata / mckinlyville?

Our mechanic is based in redding, but one of his mechanics moved to Eureka, 
and he and his girlfriend visit frequently and love the area enough that 
they are seeking employment there. Check your internet yellow pages for Auto 
Tech in Redding, CA and ask for Paul.
