Subject: Crossover pipe for ' 77 bus
Message-Id: &lt;199905132213.PAA31437_at_ados_dot_com&gt;

Howdy folks,      I have heard various comments in the past about
availability of the crossover pipe for this year bus.  Bentley refers to
this piece as the &quot;transverse exhaust pipe&quot; (Engine and Clutch p. 13). 
My bus has just the lower piece of this diagram.  The pipe on my bus has
a couple thumb sized holes in it.  Are these pipes definitely not
available through any after market supplier or OEM?  If not, has anybody
done a repair on theirs?  Does it require welding, brazing, or cutting
out the entire horizontal piece and maybe welding in a replacement?  I'm
in need of a fix if not too expensive, so that I may carry out my plans
for a long road trip within the next month or so.  My trip will be long
distance, with high rpms over the course of a few 10 to 12 hour days with
a couple days off, then the same miles in reverse.  Should this have any
bearing on the type of repair?
Any and all comments about needed repairs, etc. will be thankfully
appreciated.
