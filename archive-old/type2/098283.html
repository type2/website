Subject: Re: [T2] Accessory Vespa for Bus 

Apollogies Scott,

My point was that the perception goes both ways and that 
other's perceptions of your &quot;Cool Level&quot; shouldn't 
affect your choice to purchase something you are 
interested in or passionate about.  Our own buses 
included.

Cheers,

Duke

&gt; Also, I am concerned not at all with looking like 
&gt; a &quot;stupid trend hopper.&quot;  I'll save that for the folks 
&gt; snapping up vintage Vespas to look Retro Cool. 
&gt; 
&gt; ..ouch .. older, classic vespas and those that own them and work on them do 
&gt; it for the same reasons we own and work on our VWs .. I have many friends 
&gt; that put just as many hours in turning wrenches and polishing paint on thier 
&gt; little two strokes as i do on my bus .. peace .. scott 71 vesty
