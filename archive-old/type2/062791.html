 This may be a friday thing - or not.

 Even a sinking ship is funny as long as you're laughing.

 I call this the aluminum case/ Alzheimers Theory.

 You've all heard about eating out of aluminum pots is the root cause
of the dreaded memory loss etc.

 What if you get it thru the pores of your skin?

 Examples of unnatural? behavior abound here.: 

 There are presently people trying to get off lug nuts and crack while
fondling their dip stick.

 Snuggles is installing a flight recorder in his van for the coming
hurricane.

 Have any of you noticed how the wrench you just layed down is gone?

 Then there are those who talk to their car. How does this differ from
those who talk to walls?

 I myself can attest to the need for blood being spilled in the engine 
compartment in order to get it to run.

 What about 10mm sockets? Where do they go? 

 The list goes on but you get the idea, unless you think this is all 
rational.

 Has it occurred to you that lurkers are Sociologists and Psychologists
observing the Group Mind of Vdubbers?

 As the saying goes, &quot;of course I'm paranoid, the question is am I 
paranoid enough?&quot;
