Subject: Admin: Kill This Thread (was Re: [T2] Underfunding and low
  moral at NPS)

This thread is killed.  While it is probably of interest to many 
on this list, it is NOT ON TOPIC.
The topic of this list is busses, not NPS politics (partisan issue 
or not, it makes no difference).

I don't disagree with you, but let's not get this thread killed 
over this. According to the story, the problem is not that they 
aren't armed but rather that they can't count on backup.
