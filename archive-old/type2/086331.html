Subject: Missing Wire To Flasher Switch


&gt;2) After I spliced into a black-red and took it over to the flasher and
&gt;then stepped on the brakes we got the passenger side front parking light
&gt;and the passenger side rear parking light to go on and off when brakes
&gt;pumped. But not both brake lights.

Break out the Bentley again. Start at each Tailight bucket and identify each
wire
on each bucket and trace each one forward and see where it ends up. Check
the colors
up near where they go into the loom in the engine compartment for color
change as
they may have been spliced by a PO.

Do the same with the wires on the Brake Light sensors on the master
cylinder. Trace them
up to the fuse box. Then Finally, open the turn signals and trace each wire
to the
flasher relay. Hopefully you'll find the crossed wires.
