Subject: Re: Camber/alignment adjustment?

&lt;&lt; Could you list the necessary tools needed for a do it yourself alignment,
 please?  (I'm primarily interested in a bus ball joint front end job).  I
 seem to recall from my Bentley readings that a rather thin profile large
 wrench is needed for the camber adjustment.  How many special tools are
 involved ($$Hazet$$Schley$$), and are there any good, cheap sources for
 these or make your own solutions?
  &gt;&gt;

Try the J. C. Whitney mag-mount caster/camber gauge 17-HY-9272X, about $65.
 You can use a pair of sticks to check toe-in (see St. Muir).  Caster is set
at the factory -- it's built-in to the trailing arms and reset through the
use of shims should the chassis suffer collision damage.  Otherwise, it's not
a field-maintenance item.  The thin open-end wrenches needed to rotate the
camber adjuster are (were?) carried by Sears and used to be available per
each.  Snap-on also carries them.  Or you can MAKE one out of 3/16&quot; mild
steel plate and a plasma-cutter.  The wrenches are in inch sizes but there's
a pair that are a good match for the camber nut (ie, pivot-socket-thingee)
for both bug and bus.  Sorry I can't recall the sizes.

Maximum toe-in for both the bug and bus is about 3.3mm or 1/8&quot;. Minimum is
zero (ie, straight ahead).  Shoot for an eighth and be happy if it's a tag
shy.

Camber is half a degree, give or take a third of a degree (30' +/- 20').
 Since the typical camber gauge will read down to 10' of arc (and the good
ones to 5') you will have no trouble matching spec.  But be sure to start
with a level axle and equally inflated tires.

Once you understand the geometry involved you can fabricate a single-purpose
tool to measure camber using a plumb-bob but it will only work on that
particular type &amp; diameter of wheel.  

Be sure your bearings are tight before doing any camber or toe-in adjustment
- -- and remember to reset bearing-play when done.  I've noticed that none of
the 'experts' at the local alignment shops bother with this critical
preliminary.
