I will be heading out tommorrow to meet &quot;Poor&quot; Richard Palmer. Those of you
who attend, please stop by the 71 Westy (can't miss it, three shades of red
and a white latex camper top, SC license plate) and say hi, me and my dog
Lucy would be very happy to meet you! Got chili cookin for Saturday
afternoon.(Spouses beware!!)

Travel safe.
Mark
