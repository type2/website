Subject: Re: [T2] Don's CV boots -- let's get serious here

&gt;From: &quot;Mitchell Motorworks&quot;

&gt;You can run into all kinds of problems with this job that could leave you 
&gt;hanging.
&gt;Strip out a bolt and you have to cut it off. (need new bolt and hack saw)

Vise Grips have worked wonders for me here. Using a combination of the 12pt 
in a rachet and the visegrips on the outside of the head of the bolt.

&gt;You can have a hard time pulling off the snap-ring.

Sit in comfortable chair and hold axle between the legs. Good SOLID snapring 
pliers are a must the kind with the changable heads don't cut it.

&gt;You can twist the bearing too far and all the balls fall out, then what do 
&gt;you do?

This can suck too. It might take a while to put back together it did for me. 
See Below.

&gt;How are you going to clean all the old grease out?

I actually took all of them apart to ease cleaning, but I did them one at a 
time so I could use the others as models to compare to when putting them 
back together. The first one was the hardest they get easier after that. A 
pail with kerosene would work well or the fancy carb dip cans with the 
basket.

About $10  and an hour to clean them up.
