Subject: alternator tip &amp; question

In putting in a new alternator, i replaced much of the
related wiring. I found a good $4 replacement at
Wallmart for the heavy positive line that runs to the
battery from the alternator. 

I picked up a 27&quot; battery cable meant for a riding
mower. It's just a bit heavier than the stock one and
has a eye hole at each end, so attaches in a second to
the alternator contact (i added a couple washers) and
to the positive battery clamp. It comes in several
lengths. I guessed on 27&quot; and it was about perfect.

Question: I just put 40 straight weight oil in my bus.
We are sliding quickly into fall. As it gets colder,
can one &quot;thin&quot; the oil by adding 30w or 20w of the
same brand?

I plan on switching to 30w at the next change and
warming up real good.

If this sparks an oil jihad, pls email me direct.
tnx
