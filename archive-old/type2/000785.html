&gt;Grant,
&gt;I think you miss 3/4 of the point. 1/2 of the kick of the dual advance
comes from the retard section and it is NOT turned off. It gives an
immediate 12 degrees punch when the throttle is opened.
&gt;PLUS, most miles occur in 4th gear, and the advance was always on in 4th.

Hi Al, well just call me dumbo, then.  But I thought that the retard was
basically an emissions feature there to make the heads hotter to burn the
rich mixture at idle, and was set to snap off the instant the throttle
cracks open.  So it really isn't giving you any extra power, is it?  Don't
you get the extra power when the retard goes away, when, as you say, the
throttle opens?  Isn't it just heating your heads, which is not, perhaps the
best thing for those of us living at or above 54 degrees?

Also, please let me know why I would want the vacuum advance to kick in in
4th gear and not in first, when I'm trying to overcome inertia to my heavily
loaded vehicle?  By the time I reach 4th the load is usually moving along
nicely.

Thickheaded regards,

Grant
