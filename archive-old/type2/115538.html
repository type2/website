Subject: RE: key broke in ignition

I had considerd it, but could not figure out what kind of adhesive would be 
strong enough, but also not ruin the inside of the lock.
When I look at the key whole there are two barels that spring into place and 
cover the key hole when the key is removed. I suppose I would have to 
separate them tiwh an additional tool as not to lose all the adhesive on 
theM. Then when I look down the hole there is a block on either side that 
can be pushed out of the way. Any one know if I have to push them out of the 
way to get it out?
Also, whould it be possible to just remove the switch and take it apart to 
an extent that I would be able to remove the piece and put it back together? 
I think this is what I would prefer to do, just fix it.
Thanks,
Kyle

bad luck is an understatment it has been terrible luck lately.
