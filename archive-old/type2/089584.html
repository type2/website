Subject: Re: [T2] Jupiter Tires?

Yep Yep, I got a set all the way around when I lived in the Bay Area
(CA).  Although they were not as cheap as $49.  I paid about $400 for
5.  But that could just be the Bay Area pricing.  I still have the same
tires 3 1/2 years later and they are doing great.  I have yet to rotate
them and they are just now showing signs of needing rotation.  Specs are
1800Lb _at_ 65PSI.  Hope that I will be able to find them again when I get
another set.

&gt; Went to Big O today regarding a tire for my other car and

&gt; then he said he had Jupiters for $49. Both are 8 ply tires D rated. Any body
&gt; hear of these Jupiter tires??
