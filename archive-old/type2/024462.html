My 75 Camper awaits new HD KYB shocks, replacement of the puny 2-ply tires,
new CV boots/grease and all fuel lines and will be spending a good part of the
winter safe in the garage with an occassional weekend run to keep things
limbered up. I ran a compression test and all 4 cylinders are in the 110 to
115 lb. range so with a recently replaced a clutch, I'm going to delay doing
any major engine work even though I need to replace the fuel gauge sender. I
refuse to cut a hole in the floor and am willing to do it the hard way.

If you or you significant other is having trouble thinking of the perfect
Christmas gift, don't forget, if you don't already have one, the official Type
2 List hat. Cost, ordering information and photo is at my web page.

I'm having car show withdrawal already and it's only November!!
