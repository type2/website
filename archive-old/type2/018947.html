Clark:
Yes, the BA-6 is under the center floor, replacing the center heat tube.
The &quot;A&quot; in BA-6 indicates Auxilliary. This is a completely different
heater than the BN-4. It really works well, putting the heat in the
original heat ducts.
Adding one is a real chore, though, because the installation is so
integrated into the construction. I doubt they were EVER dealer
installed.
They use the engine as a primary blower fan, and have a secondary blower
fan that recirculates air from the rear floor of the cabin under the
back seat. This hooks onto the intake of the heater with a y-fitting and
a flapper valve so that the heater can be used without the motor
running. (These things use a lot of power and therefore have self-timers
to limit the amount of running without the motor running as it would
deplete the charge in the battery in short order.)
I would say that I don't believe they are suitable for camping or other
long cycle use.
This same heater was used from 75(?) thru 79 and 80-83 in Vanagons and
also in the DA-6 (diesel)form in diesel Vanagons.
They are an electrical troubleshooting nightmare (in my estimation), but
really sweet when they work.
Parts, if available, are REALLY expensive. When I checked a few years
back the combustion air blower for my diesel was more than $700! (I
substituted the one from my 78, which seemed to work okay).
After living with one of these every winter since 82, I'm kinda low on
enthusiasm for 'em. I know where there are two in a junkyard, I suppose
I oughta take em out before they get crushed.
I'm really more inclined to take G.M. Bulley's plan and just use the
heat exchangers more efficiently.
