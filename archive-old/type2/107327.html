Subject: booster fan fuse

 I seem to blow out the booster fan 16A fuse every four or five months. I don't use it that often but I noticed that it squeals once in a while (can't hear it form the cab) and I'm wondering if it's seizing temporarily and causing the fuse to blow.

Anyone had any experience with this? Is the fan serviceable; does it require lubrication. It sat in one spot for a many years...
