Subject: Re: [T2] stock vs aftermarket exhaust.

 
&gt;I have a 78 and converted to the older 74-75 exhaust system which is
&gt;avaliable in Stainless Steel, good and solid and should last a long &gt;time.

Also consider smog and inspection laws in your state. We in california (and likely some others) can't get away with this move.

I'll have to smog my '79 till 2009!

Billy
