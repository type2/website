&gt; Somewhere I heard that a brake booster could be added to pre-71 Busses as an
&gt; option.  I don't want to switch my '70 over to disc brakes but would like to
&gt; need a bit less leg to stop it.  Anyone ever done this conversion?  I also
&gt; heard that there is an electrical part I can wire in so I don't need to run
&gt; the booster hose all the way back to the engine.  True?  What parts would I
&gt; need to come up with for this to work?

Electrical part? A vacuum pump is what you'd need. I don't know where you'd
get one.

I would suspect that you'd need everything between the foot and the master
cylinder, including the master cylinder but excluding the foot (the one on
the end of your leg will be fine) off a 71 or above to do this conversion,
plus the intake manifold center section (which is where the vacuum comes
from with no electric pump) and vacuum line to the engine. Use a new master
cylinder; the servo is expensive so a good used one will do. If you can find
a loaf bus in a junkyard with the whole brake pedal to master cylinder
subsystem intact, that will help a lot. If you can't find a 71 Bus with the
intake manifold intact, an automatic-transmission Bug has the same manifold.
