Subject: Heater Blower Fuses keep burning out
Message-ID: &lt;382B4726.284_at_usa_dot_net&gt;

I over that past couple months, figuring the weather would eventually
get colder (as it has) that I should get my heater system running as
good as it can be.   Part of that process was getting the heater boxes
to work properly (which they do now) and also to get my heater blower to
work (which it did, at least until recently).

Twice now, the heater blower has failed to work, and I'm finding out
each time that it's because of a blown fuse.  I just put in a fresh 16
amp fuse in the in-line coupler in the rear engine compartment, right
next to the heater blower.  Again, within minutes, the fuse was blown,
and although the wires were not hot, the in-line fuse coupler was so hot
that I could not touch it.

Any ideas on why I keep blowing fuses?  Is something grounded
improperly?  Should I be using a higher amp fuse?   Should I bypass the
system as is and hook up an alternative switch to the fan?

Any suggestions, particularly from folks who have had the same problem
in the past, would be most appreciated.   Thanks!
