Subject: Re: Bus body is rusted badly/considering getting a new body.

You can only get rid of rust by cutting it out and replacing it and treating
the rest of the metal. Outragously expensive. is a bit harsh don't ya think?
We have to make a living to and buy the tools and equipment to do the job
plus up keep on them. If it was easy monkey's could do it. Personally for
what i do, i don't think $30.00/ hr plus parts &amp; materials is out of line.
As for 7 panels that need replacing , shit your gettin off easy try
replacing everything up 8&quot; all the way around the bus as some of the split
guys do.
