Subject: Re: Dizzyness: Canister on wrong side

Is it possible that the coupler on the bottom of the distributor is
installed 180 degrees out?  I've never had one of those apart, but it
seems to be possible (and even easy) to mess up.

Also, you have to be careful when swapping wires.  It seems an easy task,
but somehow when faced with more than two wires I lose the ability to
count beyond two and distinguish clockwise from counterclockwise.  Label
the wires at both ends before swapping.  I use white electrical tape and a
sharpie marker to mark them more or less forever.

Since this is a part purchased from a FLAPS, they should make good on it.
Perhaps the counter guy doesn't understand that VW distributors often have
a retardation built into #3 and that it doesn't do any good if you move it
to #1.  If it were me, I'd return it and get a correctly assembled
distributor.

&gt; Anyway, does his advice sound right? I'm a little confused on the
&gt; relationship between the cam, valve position, and timing, but it seems to
&gt; me that you could not successfully install a dizzy 180 out unless you also
&gt; installed the distributor timing gear 180 out.
