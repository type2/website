Subject: Re: [T2] Checklist before leaving  and  fix-a-flat

Sage advise, ladies and gents.  I kept the stuff to prevent roadside
tire repair, or replacement.  No fun bangin' lugnuts on the side of the
road!  My usual MO was to use fix-a-flat to get off the highway, replace
the tire with a spare in a friendly parking lot, air out the fix-a-flat
tire, and keep on truckin'.  I knew tire busters had a severe aversion
(for good reason) to repairing tires with the stuff inside, hence the
airdown on my part.  

Looks like I'll be taking a look at my battle plan again, minus the fix-a-flat!
 Pre-slimed tires might be the ticket, to prevent the flat all together.
 I use Slime on all of the family bikes and bike trailer.  Of course,
they don't see freeway speeds ('cept on the bike rack).

Thanks,

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; The check list looks good I would advise you to loose the fix-a-flat.
&gt; That
&gt; &gt; stuff is really bad. It also contains flammable material which I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; personally seen explode at a tire shop while getting new tire mounted.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any feedback on &quot;Slime&quot; pre-puncture sealant...A buddy of mine uses
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; on his strictly farm-used pickup and swears by it. Just curious about
&gt; &gt; street use...
&gt; 
&gt; wouldn't touch the stuff with a ten foot pole, would drive on the flat
&gt; first, it does less damage to the tire!!!!  (and I know from first
&gt; hand
&gt; experience)
