Subject: [T2] Bus --&gt; Vanagon rear brake conversion

Hey all,
As I was flipping through the latest RMMW catalog I began to wonder if it's
possible to convert the late Bus rear brakes to the late Vanagon
self-adjusting rear brakes.

I'd like to hear from anyone who has done this.

My ideal scenario would be to keep the Bus backing plate and Bus shoes and
adjusters.  Screw the adjusters all the way in and leave them.  Replace the
metal bar that joins the tops of the shoes with the self-adjusting mechanism
found on the Vanagon (should fit w/ no problems as I recall).

The only pitfall I see with this plan is the large upper spring.  On a late
Bus like mine ('79) the upper spring is one piece.  It clips to a heavy bar
which is the push bar for the parking brake mechanism.

On the Vanagon, this bar is replaced by the self-adjusting rod.  However,
the Vanagon does not have one solid spring, rather it has two springs.  On
each spring, one end hooks to the brake shoe while the other hooks to a spot
formed into the backing plate.  I suspect this is to keep it out of the way
of the brake adjuster rod so that it can turn itself as necessary.  I'm
wondering if I just replaced the metal bar in the Bus with the Vanagon rod,
would the single large spring interfere with the rotation of the
self-adjuster?

I'd love to have the self-adjusting rear brakes on the Bus and I think it
might possibly work but the spring issue seems to be the real concern.

Anyone know if this will work or not?

I suppose the other possibility is to replace the Bus backing plate with the
Vanagon backing plate and just build it up from there with the Vanagon
parts.  Are the Vanagon and Bus backing plates interchangeable?  Of course
that involves some junkyard scrounging which I'd rather not do if I can just
throw the self-adjuster from the Vanagon into the Bus system :-)

Thanks in advance,
