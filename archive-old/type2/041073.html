My guess would be the condenser or coil.  You should carry spares of these
parts so this is a good time to buy them if you don't have them.

The fact that this is an intermittant problem bothers me though.  You
might just have a loose connector.  I'd do the coil/condensor thing first
and then go hunting for loose connections.
