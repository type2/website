Subject: Re: [T2] Carb replacement

&lt;&lt;  I am now ready to replace the carb setup that I have
&gt; on my 73 westy. I
&gt; currently have a Weber progressive single carb and I
&gt; think that I want to go
&gt; back to the dual setup.   
  &gt;&gt;

Aircooled_dot_net has lots of info on dialing in carb(s) (If only it were that
simple...) which may be the solution rather than starting all over a-
gain with a set of new/used carbs ...
