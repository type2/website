Subject: Re: [T2] Kick Panels

I've got some new kick panels for my '72 on order from Ron...  If you
don't have something by the time I get 'em, I'll trace 'em on something
for you...  Here's the url of the bus depot pic:

I'm going to try and brace the back of the drivers side panel when I
install the new ones.  Because I'm short I tend to &quot;boost&quot; myself with a
foot there...  Just one little rod or something wedged in there oughta
do it...  Anyone done this?  Can I insulate in there, or does it need to
be freeflowing?

They're $50 at bus depot.
