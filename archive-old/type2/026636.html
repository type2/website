ANY time there is fuel leakage you should be worried.  Fuel is very
flammable and Busses don't agree with being caught on fire.

You guess would be correct in assuming that the filler pipe is leaking...or
there is a crack/hole on that side of the tank about half way up (less
likely but a possibility)...In side the engine compartment there is a Black
knock out circle on the passenger side (right side) of the bus, that is an
access panel to the filler tube.  However you will probably need to pull the
tank to do the repair depending what's wrong...but that access point is the
place to start.
