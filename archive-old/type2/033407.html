Subject: Husbands, Busses and Obsession

Hi folks, I know this might seem like an odd question, so I waited till 
Friday. Here goes: Is there a point where a wife/s.o. should start to worry 
about their husbands/boyfriends love of VW busses becoming an obsession? I 
ask this for several reasons: 1) How much time is too much time to spend 
working on a vehicle that has already had everything rebuilt, and runs well? 
2) Is it manditory to &quot;tweak&quot; things on a regular basis? 3) How many 
accessorys does a Delux ' 78 Westphalia camper need, anyway? And the Big One: 
Is my husband the only one who looks at his westy and gets &quot;excited&quot;( I've 
seen him actually running his hands over the bus and drooling...Strange, at 
least in my book...) Please don't get me wrong. I love my husband, he really 
is a great guy, and I love the camper too, but on occasion, its almost like 
its the 2nd woman. Hope that doesn't sound too silly.
Thanks, Nikki ( whos husband mumbled something about &quot;wheel Bearings&quot; this 
morning and wandered off into the garage 2 hours ago...)
