Hi Volks,
Thought I would run this little idle problem with you guys and gals to get
your humble opinions.  I reinstalled the 1600 SP rebuilt engine in my 1970
bus.  I replaced plugs, cap and rotor and adjusted the carb as per Bentley.
When she fired up the first time she ran pretty good during the break in
session.
Afterward when I tried to adjust timing and idle  I have these symptoms..

- The timing light will occasionally skip a flash
- idles rough..like its missing
- when I turn on the headlights, the idle drops

Any thoughts?


Ciao
