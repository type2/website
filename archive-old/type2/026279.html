Also there was a Devonette and a Torvette early on.  Part of the problem
with identifying them is that each model changed over the years (eg the
inclusion of a Z-bed is probably age related rather than model related).
Also there were different options that could be ordered.  Mine has a
fairly basic spec (no fridge, wardrobe or electric hookup), but then has
an expensive spacemaker poptop.  You could almost say that no two
conversions are the same.
