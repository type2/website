Paul,

You are indeed very lucky -- if I read this, you make no mention of a fire
extinguisher.  US$10 investment that every home mechanic should have
on-board.  Get two, you never know when you can pull over and help someone
along side the road.

Fire trucks are great, but there are sure a lot of places -- especially on
the road -- where preparation makes all the difference.

P.S.  On your wire harness.  How far did the fire go?  Is the starter and
battery gone?  There really aren't that many wires that go to the rear
engine compartment on a type1 engine -- might be easiest just to do some
proper splices and extend the old ones.  Re-doing all the front wires is a
PITA, not worth it if it isn't required.

    Yesterday we experienced the dreaded engine fire in our 71 westie. 
Fortunately, we live in a small town and the response from the fire
department was incredibly quick.  Amazingly, all that was really damaged was
the hoses, wiring harness, and assorted plastic/rubber parts.
    Granted, I was probably careless in inspecting the fuel lines, and
granted I was also unlucky- but beware it does happen- it can also happen to
you.
    I guarantee that when it goes back on the road that there will be
braided fuel line on it, particularily where the line passes through the
metal.  Please don't let this happen to you!  It is simple to prevent-I
didn't and I got bit (thankfully there were no injuries)
    One last item-anybody got an extra wiring harness they want to sell?
Paul
