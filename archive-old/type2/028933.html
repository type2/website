Hi David,

Besides the two obvious screws on the underside of the track cover, there is
a third one on the siding door side.

The top edge of the track cover is bent down parallel to the van's side, at
the front of this lip right up by the sliding door there is a small nut
attached to a bolt that goes right through the pillar and has a cross point
screw style head on the inside of your van.

Once you've undone that nut/bolt and the 2 screws then pull the bottom of
the track cover out just enough to get the screw tabs clear of the tabs on
the body and apply upward force to break the rust and crud seal which has
developed over the last 20+ years.

You will probably want to give it a good clean and repaint while its off.
Also check that you don't have dried up grease in the track - it should be U
shaped from end to end.

Good luck

You all are awsome - you Rock! I got my lights working
perfectly. Now for the sliding door. I need to take
the guard off. I see the two screws at either end, but
after that how is it attatched? Won't seem to come
loose. Do I need to remove it to put the slide block
back in? Thanks again for all your help...
