These heaters have a timer switch that kicks off after like 10minutes....if
you are running off an aux battery, I doubt you could fire it more than a
few times without draining the battery..................

Point is really can't use it for hours on end.....if you could you would
burn yourself up with heat.

Those propane heaters put out CO as well, and when you fall asleep with one
of those on you might not wake up.

I fire my BA-6 right before bedtime, it gets it hot in the van, and then I
fall asleep.  If I wake up and am frigid, I will fire it again, and that
will make it until morning.  My sleeping bag is a zero degree model, though.

&gt; I haven't decided yet if I would use the heater when camping. I have to
&gt; admit it sounds tempting, but I haven't even fired up my BN-4 yet so I
don't
&gt; know how it performs or that it doesn't burn clean, etc. I would have to
get
&gt; a co detector to run it all and feel safe.
&gt;
&gt; My question now is: are there many people running the BN-4 on the list who
&gt; have had good experiences with it stock location or otherwise?
&gt;  I would like to hear some people say they use theirs all the time and
never
&gt; had a problem with it, even using it at night when camping.
&gt;   I have bought all the stuff I need to install it and am only a breath
away
&gt; from doing it. More input for or against it sure would be appreciated!!

&gt; &gt; Steve:
&gt; &gt; I see where this is headed and am really concerned that some of you out
&gt; there
&gt; &gt; are considering using the BN-4 or BA-6 as a camping heater. Carver (or
&gt; Porpex)
&gt; &gt; made camping heaters and possibly the newer Espars for truck sleeper
use,
&gt; might
&gt; &gt; be okay, but I sure wouldn't trust any of the old Eberspaechers that
I've
&gt; had
&gt; &gt; to make heat clean enough to sleep in all night! I'd want to add a
&gt; flexible
&gt; &gt; exhaust pipe about 10 feet long at least. IOW, they were ALL stinky!
Clean
&gt; &gt; enough if you were moving, but scarey if sleeping. I don't think they
were
&gt; ever
&gt; &gt; made for that.
&gt; &gt; At very least I'd carrry a portable CO detector.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also has anybody else thought or gone through with installing the
&gt; heater
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhere else besides the engine compartment? I was thinking maybe
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under the z-bed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hmm,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Running fuel lines in the passenger compartment is a big No-no, much
&gt; less
&gt; &gt; &gt; burning it there.  You are on your own, but from a safety standpoint i
&gt; &gt; &gt; dont think i'd ever consider putting a gas heater inside the bus. What
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; &gt; it springs a leak in the middle of the night, you want it separated
from
&gt; &gt; &gt; yoru sleeping loved ones (or if you are single &amp; love yourself, loved
&gt; &gt; &gt; one) by 1 foot of airspace or a firewall?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I know some old splitties had one inder the dash inside the bus
3
&gt; &gt; &gt; inches from the passengers Knee, but ask me if I am looking for one...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; take care,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
