I know this is a relatively straight forward procedure but since it is my
first time, could someone walk me thru installing a new clutch pressure
plate and disc on the 1776 engine I am about to put in my 1970 single cab.
What prep tricks, if any, should be done to the disc prior to install;
should I do anything to the flywheel surface, etc.? I am also going to
install  a new throwout bearing. All advice is appreciated. TIA,

Martin, Austin, Tx
