Subject: How about a car cover for a hightop?

So.....I am just sitting here, exhausted from playing with the bus all day, 
and started thinking about how I am going to probably baby it after she is 
all done up.

Then, I thought about how a car cover might be good, and would probably keep 
the paint and seals nicer for longer, provided I don't get lazy with it.

Anyone know of a company that makes car covers for hightop busses? Probably 
not, but I figured I would ask you all. I see them all the time for busses 
and westies, but not for the hightops....

Thanks all
