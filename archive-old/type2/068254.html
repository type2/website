Subject: Rust around bottom of windshield -- '81 Westfalia

Hi folks  --

I've seen this one come up a few times, but no satisfactory
answers yet.  Here's my question:  I have access to a number
of vans with less rusty metal than mine around the windshield.
I could cut that whole area out of another one and keep it for
the day when mine becomes intolerable... it should be intolerable
now, as it drips inside regularly :(  but I am very lazy.

I have already cleaned that area up once, but at this point there's
not enough metal to get completely rust free and bondo, it'd
fray away completely in the process I fear.

Is it more sensible to fix it later by attempting to weld in new
metal (I am not a welder but I am quite willing to learn...), 
by replacing that whole area of the front end (whatever
that means, I don't have specific boundaries in mind...), or
simply to wait a few years and buy another westfalia with a
better body and put all my nice healthy parts in there?

        Gary
