&gt; &gt;After installing my GORGEOUS new stereo.....I am having trouble...
&gt; &gt;....in the past two days I have found that my DIGITAL/QUARTZ clock seems to
&gt; &gt;be losing about 5 minutes every hour.
&gt; &gt;Now I did my science homework in my day, and as far as I know this isn't
&gt; &gt;scientifically possible, unless of course type 2's exist in a parallel
&gt; &gt;universe etc. etc. etc. or someone has used something other that quartz to
&gt; &gt;run this display
&gt; &gt;Any ideas

Hate to disappoint you but you're off by a factor of 3600. That's mps,
not mph.
Garp's bus is probably RHD so maybe they don't have to  go so fast as
LHD's.
