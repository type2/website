&lt;&lt; Walk into a FLAPS and try to order a FRONT main seal. It's in all the
computers as a REAR main seal. Probably a holdover from the fact that the
flywheel is pointing the wrong direction in all those other vehicles on the
road.

So If I ordered a seal for my old Mini, I'd order a &quot;right&quot; seal (that's the
side the flywheel's pointin' to... ?-)
