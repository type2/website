Subject: plug threads blowing out

could you just drive with 3 cylinders firing?  i.e. just remove the 
offending plug and limp home.

i have driven on 3 cylinders in my triumph; i have not tried it in my 
bus...it may not have enough power with only 3 cyl.  it could also 
unbalance the engine and cause wear, but we are not talking about big 
distances or long times at high speeds here.
