Subject: RE: [T2] Electric heat.. 12V blankets


wal-mart in Canada sells 12V electric blankets for $43 i think. that is
barely more than $25 American. I looked into them but then read the manual
for my bus and my heater has a preheat function as I am sure most bus's do.
I think that someone disconnected the wires to power it but I am going to
try to figure it out. There are three wires tied up and disconnected neatly
and I assume that they are they wires I need to figure out.

When we use 2 160 electric blankets off the inverter, usually the 80
watt setting is used if at night.  I have a continuous voltmeter on the
dash..  I assume it draws only the wattage of what you are running.
These blankets are good for prewarming the bed before crawling in.  As
to  the alternator, yes it too has 227+ K miles on it!  Anyone know of
direct 12v electric blankets??  MB

&gt; That 320 watts is drawing 30 amps from your 55 amp alternator (55% of its
&gt; peak capacity) continuously.  Might not be a problem in the short term,
but
&gt; at night (when headlights are drawing an additional 10 amps) you will
&gt; likely approach or exceed the rating of your alternator.  In this case,
&gt; your battery will not charge and may even discharge, and you risk
&gt; overheating or burning out your alternator.  If you can, try and find 12V
&gt; blankets to eliminate the conversion losses from the inverter
