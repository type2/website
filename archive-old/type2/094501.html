Subject: Re: [T2] Hot Start Relay Question 

[...]
The relay in line will not extend the life of the solenoid on the 
starter.  It is there to reduce the current path from the battery to the 
starter solenoid allowing heavier current flow to it.  The solenoid will 
still be doing the same job under the same conditions.
Two main  causes of clicking starter solenoids are:
not enough current/voltage  (low battery, over long small guage current 
path)
solenoid breaking down (heated worn contacts kicking out, overheated 
stressed coil dropping out)

Most bad starters are just the solenoid portion.  It takes a major 
beating doing its job.  Many fords have the solenoid remoted from the 
starter where it is quickly and easily replaced.  It is not unusual to 
find an older ford of this type still running on its original starter 
but 3rd or 4th solenoid.

&gt; My '77 developed difficulty starting when the starter was hot, so I
&gt; installed a hot start relay.  I then had clicking like you describe,

&gt; starter seemed to work OK.  Eventually the solenoid continued to 
&gt; deteriorate
&gt; to the point where it would only start when the engine was completely 
&gt; cold,
&gt; even with the relay.  A used solenoid/starter fixed both the clicking 
&gt; and
&gt; the hard start problem.  I now feel that the relay will allow you to 
&gt; extend
&gt; the service life of a solenoid, but not forever.  If my clicking ever 
&gt; comes
&gt; back I might try a lower-current relay, or I might just use that as an
&gt; indicator to buy a new solenoid.
