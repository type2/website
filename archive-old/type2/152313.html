&gt; At the end of my drive home from work yesterday I came to a stop to find
&gt; the garage door opener.  When I started up the driveway I heard 4 or 5
&gt; clicks and then a squealing.  I got out and looked around a little bit
&gt; and nothing looks abnormal at quick glance.  I got back in and it
&gt; squealed half weay up the driveway and stopped.  Does this sound like
&gt; brakes or a wheel bearing or something?  Any other ideas?

are you sure your alternator belt is tight??
