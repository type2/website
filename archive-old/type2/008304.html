&gt; To the owner of the too hot running engine:
&gt; 
&gt; maybe the oil cooler is partially plugged up, causing too much oil
to use
&gt; the bypass valve, and thus not enough is getting cooled.  Does
anyone know
&gt; if it is possible to get these coolers checked to determine the
resistance
&gt; vs. spec?  the Bentley says something about it (or maybe Haynes),
but many
&gt; services they refer to are no longer commonly available.

You could set up a test bench yourself.  You'd have to make a system
of a container (say, 1 gallon) connected via 3/4 inch or so pipe to
one of the ports on the oil cooler.  The reservoir should be 3 or four
feet above the cooler, and you would need another bucket to catch the
liquid that flowed from the open port of the cooler.  All you need to
do is record the time it takes for a quantity (measured between two
marks on the reservoir) of the liquid to pass through the cooler.

The reason for the large tubing is so that all of the resistance to
flow will be in the cooler.  You will need to be consistent in the
liquid that you use and the temperature of the oil during the tests. 
Two or three good coolers would give you a good baseline that should
be markedly different from any partially blocked cooler you encounter.
 I would be tempted to use water as the testing liquid, as its
viscosity varys much less with temperature than that of oil.  The
coolers would have to be cleaned out with solvent to allow water to be
used for testing.

At this point you put an ad in VW T&amp;A, advertising your oil cooler
testing service!  :)
