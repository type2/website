Subject: Fw: [T2] Turn signal lights on instrument cluster do not flash.(phase 2)

------=_NextPart_001_0001_01C1907D.A8FF9B40



Volks,
 I worked on the problem more this afternoon.

When I pull the emergency flashers knob with the key off, the instrument =
cluster lights flash like they should.  =20

When I turn the key to the on position, they flash externally, but do not=
hing on the dash..............

So, I think maybe it is the contacts in the turn signal switch itself.  S=
o I pull it off and spray deox on it.............to know avail..everythin=
g external works, but nothing internally when the key is on.  I looked at=
 the various t connectors, and all seem to be well.  Does anyone know wha=
t wires should be hot in the turn signal column switch?  There are quite =
a few wires...............I figure something in there must enter hot and =
then when you flip it to turn left or right, a contact is made and a circ=
uit completed to the flasher relay, and then the dash things work........=
...........

The previous owner says that they worked fine &quot;until&quot; he installed a new =
speedo a few years back.  Since they worked on the outside, he did not sw=
eat it.  =20

Hi,

I just went thru a similar deal with the 68 bus. The relay was flat
and square with three tabs. There is a whole in the center that a
screw goes thru to ground it to the bracket for the steering column.
The wiring diagram in the Bentley show a totally different setup
which I have never seen in any 68 or 69 bus.
There is a blue wire that comes from the e-flasher to one of the
light bulbs in the cluster and then it jumps to the other. You may
have a problem with the e-flasher.

Keep in mind that the dash blinkers only work when the ignition  is
in the run position.  Also make sure the e-flasher is secured tightly
to the dash. If it is loose things get funky.

I have spent about 8 hours of time and two of my friend Roy's fixing
weirdness with blinker, brake and dash lights but it is all right and
it feels good.  Don't give up!

&gt;I have been troubleshooting why the little green arrow=3Ds on my
&gt;instrument cluster do not flash ..............I tested
&gt;bulbs...good................old relay looked a little fried, and it
&gt;appeared to be stock.....only one of the 2 clickers in it slicked,
&gt;and when i manually clicked the other with a screwdriver, the arrow
&gt;on the cluster lit up...so I thought a new relay would solve the
&gt;prob.
&gt;
&gt;Externally, everything works fine.
&gt;
&gt;Well, just got the new relay in from the bus depot, and it looks
&gt;different, but had 4 posts.It had a p terminal (I figured must be
&gt;KBL on my old one) and a 49 terminal which I figured must correlate
&gt;to my 49+ on mine.  I hooked it up, same result.  Exterior works,
&gt;interior nothing.
&gt;
&gt;What gives?
&gt;
