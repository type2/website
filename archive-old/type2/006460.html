Can anyone please tell me when this show is.? (Bus content) Has anyone tried
successfully to rebuild the steering box on their bus? I have access for a
few weeks to a full machine shop and 2 spare steering boxes. I'd rather try
to do this myself if it can be done safely at home rather than wait 2 months
for Wolfgang. Any comments greatly appreciated.
