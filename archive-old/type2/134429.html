 Finding #1 watching the #1 intake valve go in and back out to find TDC.
Ok I am fine with that, but when the timing marks don't line up ??
 
As soon as the #1 intake valve is out all the way, should I be looking at
the timimg lines being lined up with the rotor in the dist, right away...
because I am having to rotate it another 3 inches to get the timing line to match
the dist line and the rotor.  Is the Dist. out 90 or 180 degrees?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Forget about watching #1 intake to line up the timing marks.

Remove the 3/4 valve cover. Rotate the engine IN the direction of rotation.
A remote starter button works very well.
Watch the #3 valves. You will see the intake open and close, then immediately 
you will see the exhaust open and close. As long as you see this, you are going the right 
way. Go around again and watch the intake. It will open and then close. Just as it closes,
STOP. At the instant the intake closes and the exhaust starts to move, look at your timing mark.
At the point of rocking, this is when the rocker arms actually rock, the timing mark had better 
be on dead zero. If not, your cam timing is off. At the point of #3 rocking, your #1 cylinder 
is at TDC to fire. Look at your dist rotor, it should be pointing at the index mark on the top
edge of the body.
