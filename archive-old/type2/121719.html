Hiya Warren,

Let's go to the one part of your post I can answer with any degree of 
certainty...........the 65 to 70 mph business.  Downhill, with a tailwind, maybe.  

Actually you can probably press a 1600 sp up to around 65 to 70 but you're 
gonna kill that engine.  You are wondering if you can get 50,000 to 75,000 miles 
out of that 1600 sp pushing around a Bus.  Definitely not at 65 to 70 mph.  
The heat generated by an engine working that hard will do it in.

With a 1600 sp and that heavy, heavy Bus you'd be better off thinking 55 mph 
with occasional forays up around 60 mph.  If you run that engine and Bus with 
the respect and care they deserve 75,000 miles is not out of the question.
