Subject: RE: [T2] Busted CV???

I don't think it's a good idea to drive it like that... could mess up the
tranny. I'm actually surprised that the differential is even driving the
good side. I would have expected the diff to just spin the loose drive
flange instead of the connected one. How the heck did she do that??? Was it
just the bolts that sheared? If so, you could try getting new bolts from a
dealer or an online vendor, and reconnecting it. I'd check all the cv's and
both wheels for freedom of movement and to ensure nothing else is too loose
or frozen. Also check both tranny drive flanges for freedom of movement
(jack the rear end up). I'm wondering if one side of the differential didn't
freeze up. The wheel rotation might then shear the CV bolts, and the frozen
side would allow the other side to deliver torque.

The wife was driving my bus and busted a CV Joint, assuming that was the
only
prob.  Busted it right off the wheel, Broke the bolts (allen head screws???)
right off in the wheel. OUCH!!!!!!  So, with that in mind, and Just
happening.  The bus still moves (With one driveline), Oh I didn't mention
this is the REAR CV, How do I attack this disaster.  I haven't consulted
with
my books yet.  It's seems to be just a  natural reaction to address the list
and read my book while the feedback comes in.
