How about contacting the local Rhino-liner® installer and asking... 
They have to have some solvant to clean their spray equipment...  Nah,
 that's too easy...

&gt; The PO of my bus thought it was a good idea to put rhino liner type material
&gt; in several parts of my bus.  Anyone have any suggestions on how I can remove
&gt; this tar like substance besides using a dual action sander?  Any suggestions
&gt; appreciated.......
