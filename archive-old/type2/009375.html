after the long trip out to ohio, which i made without any problems.  thanks 
to everyone for responding.  i have decided i must sell.  as much as i hate 
to, i cant do any work on it here in the apartment place and im broke.  the 
move has put me behind on everything and i need the cash.  im asking $800.  
i havent done much too it since i bought it so im not sure what needs doing. 
  it has a small oil leak, no idea from where.  the nose needs some body 
work and im sure the rest could too. it has a bit of bondo and sheet metal 
work that was done before i got it. so i dont know what it looks like under 
that. the floor looks good except for a couple small spots up front.  and it 
could use a tail pipe.  i got a couple of the flared tip ones and put them 
on just before leaving.  made it sound nice.  but i didnt tighten one of 
them down as well as i thought and about halfway i noticed it just werent 
there.  it also has the bed and the childs cot and the cabinets.  i will be 
honest it needs work, but i figured its gotta be worth at least $800.  if 
anyone is interested let me know.  i hope it goes to someone tha has the 
time to fix it up.  i will miss it. the bus is in columbus ohio.
