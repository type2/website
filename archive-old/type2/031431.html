&gt; I am in the middle of an engine repalcement adn  ihave discovered that the hoses from the heater control box all the way to the cabin have to be replaced.  Is it possible to replace them with comparable diameter HVAC flexible tubing?  If so, what is recommended?  I assume the only considerations would be heat adn oil resistance and ideally well-insulated.

I've had good results using flexible truck exhaust pipe.  I got a 25 ft
roll for about $50 it was enough to do the whole van
