Subject: [T2] UK based companys selling cranks.

O.K. This is for mainly UK list members due to shipping etc..............

I'm _at_ the point where I have to get a crank NOW if I'm going to progress
with Mr Whippys new engine over the festive season.

I have decided to go for a 69mm counter-weighted crank, I still have the
choice of forged original with weld on weights or cheap cast ones like SCAT.
The price is more or less the same _at_ £180-£200 with VAT delivered. Who/what
could you recommend? The list is long, but the main players seem to be.

German Car Co www.germancarcompany.co_dot_uk
Stateside Tuning www.statesidetuning.co_dot_uk
VEE Motors www.veemotors.co_dot_uk
Big Boys Toys www.bigboyztoys.co_dot_uk
Bernard Newbury www.bernardnewbury.co_dot_uk

Stateside say their cranks are new 25/25's welded, but I need input on any
good or bad quality you have received from any of the above. If you know of
any one else I should consider let me know, if their not in a mag
advertising cranks I might not have looked _at_ them.
