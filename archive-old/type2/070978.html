Subject: Re:  Fuel tank Venting: 72/77
Message-ID: &lt;b3b824f5.245a288a_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

&gt;I think the larger tube comes from the charcoal canister on the stock '72 
&gt;engine (Type 4, US spec), but that in later FI buses the fumes from this 
&gt;are reintroduced to the FI system. Is this correct? If not, can you tell 
&gt;me how the larger tube connects into the venting system? I need to know if 
&gt;I should plug it, leave it hanging, or in some way tie it back into the 
&gt;venting system.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for helping me vent! ;-) Joe

&gt;from what I understand on my '78 engine.

there's an air hose from the fan housing to the charcoal cannister.

&gt;from the other end (top) of the cannister, a smaller tube connects into 
the evaporation jobbies in the air intake vents which then lead into the 
2 small 'vent' tubes into the tank.

this gives a slight positive air pressure in the tank when the engine is 
running.

as far a I know, there's no fume recirculation going on on an FI engine 
apart from the EGR.

-if I'm wrong.. please let me down gently; - then I'll go and fix my bus.
