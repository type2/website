&gt;  I made a pressure brake bleeder from a one gallon garden sprayer

Which is why the Motive Products bleeder has a pressure gauge attached.

I'm sure it would.  I run mine between ten and fifteen PSI.
Just make SURE that master cylinder cap is screwed on properly and
tightly!  My neighbors certainly got to hear some colorful language, while
out working in their yard, last weekend.
