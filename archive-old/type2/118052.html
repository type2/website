&lt;&lt; Well, the problem (at least from what I
believe) seems to be from a BAD steering damper on my 73 Bus. I ordered a
new steering damper (and a few other items) from the Bus Depot,  &gt;&gt;

A new steering damper won't hurt, but it might tend to mask other
problems...My first (cheapest) guess would be unbalanced wheels, but
checking out the entire front end would be a good thing...
