Subject: el paso listees - care to look at a vw for me?

well, a friend, actually; he is planning on buying a T3 out there, but at
4K +, wants a look-see first!  he will pay $10 for your time; $25 if he
actually comes out and buys it. if this is laughably low, tell him:


David Wilcox &lt;lvlter_at_ev1_dot_net&gt;

Home number is 713.863.9985; work 713-666-5555.

he is under strict instructions to tow home any busses he finds while out
there :)
