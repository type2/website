Subject: Re: [T2] 1st fuel injection?

'72 was the first year of the 1700cc pancake with dual carbs then went to
1800cc in '73. Fuel injection was introduced in '75 on the bus with the
1800. '76 went to the two litre FI.

&gt; Near as I can remember '71 was the last year with a single carb but I 
&gt; don't know what year the air cooled started using FI.
&gt; Can anyone help me out?
&gt; Thanks.
