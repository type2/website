Just had to bring this site to your attention.

In the cars for sale section is a Kemperink type 2. A Netherlands
coachbuilt 1972 extended length, high roof type 2 panel van. Similar to
a  US built cube van. Interesting to note that if you look closely at
the engine, it's a 1600! Sure hope they have the Alpine ratio transaxle!
