Hi Volks,
   When I bought my bus. a 71 westy, it was in about 4 shades of primer 
grey.  I knew I needed to get that promer sealed up, but the body wasn't 
ready for a &quot;real&quot; automotive paint job.  So I went down to a local hardware 
store and got a gallon of Benjamin Moore fast drying enamel, it's part of 
their industrial line of paints.  Thin it out and it sprays OK, but the best 
part is it dries to the touch in 15 minutes and you can install windows in 2 
hours.  It was about $25 dollars for a gallon and comes in premixed or 
custom colors.  For another $25 you can get the hardener/gloss enhancer to 
mix with that gallon of paint.  Only problem with the hardner is that it 
slows the drying way down.  The paint is not as durable as &quot;real&quot; automotive 
paint but works good for the money.  Here's a link to it
