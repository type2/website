Subject: Jalousie window knob

Hi all,

	I have one  wrong and one missing knobs for opening/closing the
jalousie windows on my 70 Westy. On my parts bus (also a 70 Westy) it has
the proper knobs, but I was unable to unscrew them. I just figured that the
screws heads were striped out. I was just looking on the Bus Boys web site,
thinking about ordering new knobs, when I noticed that they list a screw
with a &quot;special head&quot; for 69-79 knobs. Does this mean that you need a
special driver, like a &quot;torx&quot;, to get these things off ? or is it more like
a special profile on the head to hold the knob in place? I may try drilling
the screw head out on the parts bus to get the knobs off.

Thx

Jeff
