I went to an Industrial Rubber and Gasket supplier here and they have 
sheets of neoprene (black) that goes pretty cheap - especially compared to 
what you find at the parts stores or the hardware stores. 1/4&quot; up to 1&quot; 
thick. They come in section 4 feet wide and as long as you can handle 
(afford) it.

Also should be able to get the same (or better) from commercial heating and 
cooling contractors. They also have a silver tape that makes duct tape look 
like a joke.

They use these materials to insulate duct work and equipment enclosures for 
temps and noise. I have no use for the yellow fiberglass like the hardware 
stores carry but I am instead buying the black neoprene type stuff. Much 
easier to handle and I think - at first glance - it will do a better job of 
not holding moisture. I took a scrap and saturated it and then let it air 
dry - very fast - 20 minutes (or less) and there was no moisture at all in 
the rubber to squeeze out. Seems to breathe. I don't think a heating and 
cooling man would want this to hold moisture for questions of rust and 
maybe fungus growth (?).

I haven't bought it yet, but will be this week. I don't think it will 
dampen major panel vibrations like a Dynamat would because it isn't heavy. 
However, I do think it will quieten reverberation noises (noise 
reverberating off everything in the bus). I also expect it to absorb noise 
much like carpet does when you first carpet a room. The echos go away and 
alot of the noises caused by voices, etc. seem to be muffled.

I plan to insulate the nose, the floors, and the door cavities. I have no 
intention of stuffing the material all the way down in the corners for fear 
that this might trap moisture - whether my material breathes or not. If I 
want more noise control, I'll be looking towards Dynamat or one the 
imitators for something heavier (literally).

By the way I have seen Dynamat alternatives in many, many of the industrial 
supply catalogs. And you can buy much larger pieces than the tiny sections 
that Dynamat sells. Much cheaper - no brand name to sell to the car guys. 
Generic but equal.

By the way a friend still has the OEM VW heavy rubber mat in the front foot 
well of her Riviera. Mine only had bare metal covered by a single layer of 
carpet. Big difference in cabin noise in the front seats. Could be tires, 
bearings, etc. etc. but I think that mat made a big difference for the 
front seat folks.

Also discovered that my bell housing motor/tranny mounts were broken 
allowing the bracket to slide over and ride against the frame sometimes. 
Alot of noise created there too! Check all of your motor/tranny mounts.

Last source of info. Visit a good stereo installer shop. My brother-in-law 
does this for a living and they routinely teardown new cars to add more 
soundproofing prior to major system installs. He said that there is a 
variety of materials available including sprays that help noise control. 
Some work better than others of course. He went on to say that the very 
thin sheets of jute (looks like lint in a sheet) with the aluminum foil 
backing really doesn't do much for noise. Too thin (and too expensive for 
what they are...).

Anyone else able to add to our knowledge here - or correct me?

I very interested in this subject since this about the next step in my 
project....

&gt;Howdy:
&gt;Anyone out there have suggestions more noise dampening materials to be used
&gt;in the engine compartment (in my case of a '70 Westy)? I read about using
&gt;the NASA insulation on the &quot;Heat, Rust and Noise&quot; page, and I thought I had
&gt;a source for it at Home Depot, but it was the wrong stuff. Besides, I'm not
&gt;sure I'm crazy about my engine compartment looking like grandma's tin-foil
&gt;lined oven. What else have people used in addition to the crappy tar boards
&gt;to keep down the din?
