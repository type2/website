Subject: Small cracks in heads

Hey all,

Looks like I get to rebuild my engine (again)! Yay. I managed to seize the 
front-most main bearing (somehow) last Wednesday morning. Fortunately, I 
didn't do any serious damage to the shaft. We did notice a fair amount of 
wear on the rod bearing nearest the main bearing as well (cylinder one, I 
think). Still not sure what caused the bearing to seize, but perhaps it was 
due to all the gas dripping into the engine while I was driving with the old, 
worn out carbs (about 4,000 miles), before I noticed and replaced the carbs.

Here's my bigger question: after inspecting the heads, we noticed some small 
cracks in and around the exhaust ports near the valve stem seats on both 
heads. They look to me like casting cracks, so I was wondering how common it 
is to find small cracks in the heads and will this be a problem, or do I need 
to replace them? Thanks.
