&gt; Went to see a bus today. Mid 60's split. Been inside over 30 years.
No rust. 
&gt; 10,000 on the odm.  Original paint very shiney! Belongs to a old
eccentric 
&gt; who said he bought it to play his old movies?? The guy bought it in
germany 
&gt; and thinks VW made a &quot;movie&quot; model. Give me a break. 
&gt; 
&gt; He has had in the family room of his very large (mansion) house all
these 
&gt; years and wifey making him get rid of it. He says he starts it every
once in 
&gt; a while to see if it runs and does fine. Who knows? The guy is
pretty old.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I bought it for cheap and gonna make a camper out of it.
Anybody want 
&gt; the insides? He says it all works. I will like the extra headroom.

Glad someone got this 'ol bus.  I was going to get it when I went by
last year, but he'd only let me take one of his VWs and I opted for
the '46 splitwindow.  I made it into a way cool Baja and ran it until
the engine broke.  I wonder if he has any more VWs?
