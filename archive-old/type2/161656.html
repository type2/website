Subject: Re: [T2] Name of &quot;partial&quot; pop-top?

I noticed in the brochure for the 83 they mention a
12,000 btu furnace.
http://wetwesties2.tripod_dot_com/1983_asi_brochure.html
near the bottom.
I really am interested in putting a furnace in my 74
Anyone have any leads on a used one? What's good
and not. I would like it to be propane, not gas since
I feel my gas tank isn't big enough to begin with,
and I do have a propane tank on the underside of
my westie that isn't being used for anything.

James
