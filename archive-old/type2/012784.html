Dave, i too have had problems tracking down aftermarket wheels that
are the correct dimensions.  for my bus (72) the dimensions are:
5 1/2 J x 14 with a 41.0 mm offset
(per Bentley)

everywhere i've called can get the 5 1/2 x 14 no problem, but when i
tell them i want 41 mm offset they say 'no go'.  they all say it can
be done with wheel adaptors. um, no thanks. no premature bearing
failure here. so if anyone knows where i can score some aftermarket wheels
that meet EXACTLY the same specs as stock, please let me know.

TIA.

What's a good source, web or commercial, for the small 5 lug Aftermarket Bus
wheels?  All I seem to see is the Wide 5 Lug or the Beetle 4 Lug.
