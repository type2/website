Subject: Mysterious Vacuum Gauge Readings

Folks,

First Question:

I was over at Barry's place yesterday giving him a hand with his 1700
type4 engine that he is preparing to install in his 1972 bus.  The steps
we accomplished are:
checked the dwell, which was fine at 48;
set timing at 7.5 BTDC, static.
set initial balance on the dual carbs.
At this point we fired up the engine and it ran OK but would not idle.
Because we do not have a uni-syn or equivalent we experimented a bit.  My
thought was that if we slapped a vacuum gauge onto the manifolds and set
the throttles to equal vacuum readings that would be pretty close on a
fine balance adjustment.

The problem is that the vacuum readings we got
were like nothing I hae ever seen.  We hooked one gauge to the left carb,
started the engine and the needle vibrated thru the range until it
actually stuck wide open.  We removed That gauge and put the other vacuum
gauge on and got the same result, tho we did not manage to get this one
stuck.  We repaired the first gauge and put one gauge on each carb.  When
we started the engine, both gauges did the same wild vibration.  Thinking
that perhaps the problem was that ach gauge was only reading two cylinders
I rigged a vacuum line across the engine and &quot;t&quot;ed the gauge in to read
both banks of cylinders. Again, the wild vibration.

I have seen a vibration across a range when there is a burnt valve, but
nothing like as wild as these vibrations were.  The compressions on this
engine are also good.  Not as even as I would like (110-130) but not out
of the range of my experience.

Does anyone hae any idea what could be going on here?  I left Barry to
recheck the valves and be sure that here is not a valve propped open by
any chance more ou of desperation than any hope that that is the cause.


Second Question:

(see web page http://www.everybus_dot_com/dworkin/carburetors/index.htm for
the pictures referred to)

Looking at the carbs it is not immediatly apparent to me where to hook up
the vacuum advance and retard hoses.  The '72 originally had a rather
complicated vacuum advance cut-off system that we are going to eliminate.
My plan was to look for a ported vacuum tap for the advance and a manifold
vacuum tap for the retard and hook them in.  Just from their position, I
beleive that the tap shown in picture P1010001 is a ported vacuum tap by
its location and should be good for the vaccum advance port on the
distributor, but the diameter of the tap is right for the vacuum retard
hose. I know that the taps in the boots for the disk brake booster (the
elbows at the bottom of pictures P1010002 and P1010004) should be manifold
vacuum and should be good for the retard side of the distributor.  Can
someoen check me on this?  and I correct?

My constant statement on the dual carb engines is that I have enver owned
one and that if I had one, I'd install FI on it first thing.  If I'da
wanted dual carbs, I'da bought a Triumph!

                           TIA,
                           Steve Dolan
