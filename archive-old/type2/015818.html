&gt;My engine is being rebuilt by AVP and will be ready soon. Now, who can
&gt;answer the following?  Email me with answers to any or all...TIA!
&gt;
&gt;1. Can I clean and reuse my oil cooler? How? Remanufactured ones are
&gt;available($120) but why not remanufacture my own?

Archives.

&gt;2. Are new heater boxes worth the $189 each when what we really need is a
&gt;bus that produces little heat? Mine are not in great shape, but here in
&gt;Indiana, we must garage our rust-free bodies from December to Mid-March or
&gt;the salt will eat 'em alive.

In your case I'd say they are not worth it.

&gt;3. This one bugs me:  3 years ago, I replaced my alternater. the new 55 amp
&gt;had a round fitting where you attach the rubber &quot;L&quot; shaped hose from the fan
&gt;shroud.  Well, I bought a new rubber piece at vw and it had a
&gt;three-quarter-moon shaped end instead of round.  So, there is no seal
&gt;connecting my alt to the cooling system, it just sorta blows in the
&gt;direction of the fitting it should be clamped to.     This was a real B%#$H
&gt;to work on with the eng in the bus, but now its out and I can fix it but
&gt;how?    See also #4.

You might be able to swap the rear covers with an older alternator that has
the correctly shaped cooling port.  I haven't tried it but I suspect it
would work.

&gt;4. Should I upgrade to the 70 amp alternater for my camper.  I hope to get
&gt;my dual battery setup working as part of this project, and I do have a
&gt;decent stereo/ amp.  I run a ac/dc tv and a ac/dc vcr while traveling any
&gt;distance to keep the 3 chili's smilin.  I know the alternater is expensive
&gt;and mine is only 3 years old, but man is it tough to get at once the engine
&gt;is back in!

It's not that bad to replace with the engine in IMO.  I don't know much
about the 70 amp alternator, but offhand I'd say &quot;no&quot;.  A 15 amp difference
doesn't seem worth it to me.
