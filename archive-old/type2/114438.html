&gt;Quickie question...
&gt;
&gt;I'm about to install the new clutch cable, and before I slide under the bus,
&gt;which end does the piece of plastic tubing slide to?  I'm assuming that it
&gt;covers the end up front where it exits the channel and heads to the clutch
&gt;pedal.

It's there to protect the cable after the clevis pin as it goes through to gap in the frame to where it enters the long metal tube that guides it through to the back.

I think the little white piece with the part number marked on it is just for identification. I could be wrong but my old cable didn't have one.
