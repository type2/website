Subject: [T2] New Volkswagen site update

I would like to thank everyone that has checked out the new site and has got 
a hold of us looking for parts. The response is overwhelming. Since we have 
had such a large response give us a few days to get back to all the e-mails. 
Don't think we are going to blow you off we are just packed with people 
asking for this part or another. Takes time to respond to every e-mail we 
get. Thanks again.
