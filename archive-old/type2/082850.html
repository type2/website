Here's one of the strange things about us trademark law. A lot of
times (from what i understand) to backup claims of trademark
infringement you must show that you have tried to protect that
trademark previously. That means that if VWoA didn't go after anyone &amp;
one day decided to, it would be quite hard for them to stop the other
party from using things like bug or bus. I don't know how much of the
claims VW makes would actually hold up in court, but most people don't
have the deep pockets like VWoA.
