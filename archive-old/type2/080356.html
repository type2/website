Subject: Hydraulic lifters


Another thing I forgot to mention.  One of the hydraulic lifters is stuck
from sitting so long.

This happened once before and what we did before was pour some Rislone (pine
tree smelling stuff) into the crankcase and it freed it up after running
(idling) a while.

Is this still recommended?  If see that the lifters are only about $10.  Are
these hard to replace?
