&gt; Only vehicle I ever had with a external resistor was a Sunbeam Alpine,

&gt; hangin out in space was hangin onto the coil, but it had Lucas 
&gt; electronics, so . . . .

The reason you use a resistor with a coil is so that you cut down the 
voltage going into the primary windings. MY Datsun Z car has a nice 
cermaic resistor (external) below the coil. It knocks down the 
input voltage so 
the output woltage is not too high, and does not tear up the plugs or 
points as fast. When you first start up the Datsun Z, the starting switch 
bypasses this resistor and feeds the the full 12volts to the coil. This 
way early morning starts are not so hard. You could always put one of 
these external resistors on a coil without one.

My 2 cents
