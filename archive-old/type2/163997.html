Subject: Re: [T2] Fuel Vents?

This list is so cool!

I just got back from the barn and sure enough, the filler cap is ripped at
the bottom of the ring.  It has two wierd flaps that I believe are the &quot;bird
beak&quot; flaps.  I checked the archives of the Type list and seems like the
&quot;birds beak&quot; model is for California buses?

I have a '79 Cal model.  Gowesty has a filler neck for $29.95 that fits
'79's.  It says &quot;No Unleaded Fuel Restrictor&quot;.  Would this work on my Cal
Bus?

By the way, Thanks again to the great wisdom of the list.  I'm am very
relieved it's only that.  (Hopefully!)

&gt; Remove the fuel filler cap and stick your finger in
&gt; the hole. Feel all the way around the inside of the
&gt; opening. Chances are you'll find a rip in the rubber
&gt; filler neck hose.
