Subject: idle problem/ pushrod tube seals query

Hi folks:

Perhaps someone can point me in the right direction on this one. I have a
'79 bus with a 2.0 litre engine and AFC fuel injection. When I start the
engine it idles properly. However, if I am driving and I step on the clutch
to down-shift, the engine races. If I then tap the accelerator pedal, the
rpm's drop down to where they should be. I had a defective air meter which I
replaced a year ago, and until recently the car had run properly.

Also, since I'm asking questions, I'm planning to change some pushrod tube
seals over the weekend in my '79 bus. Do I have to drain the oil from the
engine first?

Thanks.

Robert Mead
