Subject: Oh Happy Day, Looking for Syncro

I'm so happy I finally sold the Corrado, lost a mere $2800 or so
in depreciation of value and parts not counting gas on it in nearly 3
years.  Not to bad, a nice car but just not really me.

As to obligatory Bus content, well this is goin let me buy lots
o buses or maybe just start playing with a few select ones.
I'm still looking for a nice solid running Syncro any leads
please contact me.  If I can't find one its goin be time to build
an off-roadish '78.
