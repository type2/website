So I wrote:

Well Ernie, I've got a 78 like yours. No circuit diagrams, but I can
tell you a little bit.

The water pump is connected to power from the primary battery.
The wires are hanging down inside the cupboard nearest the rear. It has
a fuse on it to check. It should have unswitched 12V power. You can check for 
that. I had to replace my pump with one from Camping World for $25.
 
The auxillary battery just powers the 'fridge.

The 'fridge runs on 12V DC. When plugged into 120 V AC external power,
the transformer/ inverter under the back seat steps it down to 12V DC.
There's a checklight on the control panel to tell you it's working. 
It also has a quick charge feature with a timer
that should be able to charge your aux battery from the 120 V AC power.

My Dometic 'fridge doesn't work either, and folks say that these never
worked very well on battery, but work OK when they get external 120 V power.
I don't know about you, but I spend almost no time camping anywhere that I can get 
120V power (Like KOA parking lots, for example). If I did, I'd probably work
to fix my 'fridge. As it is, I think I'll rip out the guts and make it into
an icebox. Or buy Ron Salmon's extra propane 'fridge and do major
cabinetry to make it fit.

There's a relay in the engine compartment, back wall, driver's side,
just inside the back hatch. Its job is to go on and deliver power from 
the alternator to the aux battery (the one on the driver's side) when
you're driving, and shut off and isolate the aux battery from the primary
battery (the one on the passenger side) when you turn off the engine. That
way you can draw down the aux battery with your 'fridge (which only takes about
3 hours to suck that poor thing dry) without draining your primary battery
and stranding yourself. Mine is currently disconnected and I'm not sure how to 
hook it up, but there're basically 3 wires: one from somewhere near the alternator
(maybe after the voltage regulator?), one to the aux battery (+) terminal, and one
to the ignition switch. You'll have to learn which are which if yours isn't
currently hooked up. Since the aux battery is its whole separate circuit, I'm not
sure if it grounds to the bus body like everything else, or if the 'fridge connects
back to the battery's (-) pole. 

Hope this helps. Good luck, mon.
