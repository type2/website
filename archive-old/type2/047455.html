Thanks for the reply.

I am sure you are a bit confused as I myself am a bit confused and am 
probably not relaying the problem correctly.  I apologize.  I assumed I have 
ignition after the stall because I was able to start her the next day w/ no 
problem. After the 2nd stall, I was also able to start her the next day, 
although, after the second incident the engine sounded not so smooth as it 
usually does.  It seemed to be misfiring a bit or something like that.  My 
dad had a similiar problem with this bus before it became mine and he 
replaced the fuel filter and found it had a big chunk of gunk on the tip of 
it.  I guess I will try to replace that and see what happens.

I also had thoughts about it being a dual-relay issue.  I guess I will 
reread, again, my FI section of the Bentley guide.

Here is a newbie question.  How can I crank the engine and check for spark 
without having someone turn the ignition switch?  I was told I had to stick 
a long metal object into the engine to make it turn over but I was not told 
exactly where on the engine I should stick it.  I have no help around and I 
don't think my four year old should be learning how to turn the car on.

Sorry again for the confusion induced by my sheer lack of knowledge on the 
subject.

Thanks in advance,

Meredith
