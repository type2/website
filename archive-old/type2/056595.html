Subject: New gas heater article

Hey all,
Kudos once again to Ron Van Ness, our gas heater guru :-)

Ron has written up a very very informative article about the later-model 
Eberspacher BN4 gas heater and sent it to me for posting on my site.

This article covers the workings of the heater, its safety features, 
troubleshooting, and most importantly, proper maintenance.  This article 
will be of extreme benefit to anyone owning one of these heaters.  Ron, 
how much of the data in the article applies to the early BN4 heaters as 
well?  

This is not an installation article like Ron's other BN4 article hosted 
on my site, but is rather an article focused on how it works and how to 
care for it.

Thanks very much to Ron for what will no doubt be a very useful article.  
It can be seen at http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm -- scroll down 
until you find the GASOLINE-FUELED HEATERS section, and it's in there.
