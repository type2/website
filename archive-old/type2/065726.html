Subject: Who is L&amp;M

        I found a FRONT Tire Mount on a '77 bus in the junk yard.  
        It was/is like new, so I brought it home.  There is a faded
        metal sticker on it, with the name L&amp;M Products, Long Beach CA.
        The phone number starts wit 213 area code, so this could be an
        older item (I think the area code is now 310)

        I could not find this firm as an advertiser in HOT VW or VW TRENDS.
        
        Just curious if the company is still in business, and what the
        value of the tire mount is now.  I also got a trailer hitch
        of the old bus, plus bits and pieces for $30.  Little high, I thought.
        
        Sorry, I am not on the list.  My ISP is EROLS.COM, and they are 
        terrible for E-Mail.  barry burneskis  '78 Westy (love it!!!)
