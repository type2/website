Subject: Re: I am so cool now...who knew..oil temp ramblings

OK, as long as we're admitting our weaknesses here, let me say that I have 
never understood the air cleaner on my '70.  There seem to be two flaps.  The 
one on the right is controlled by some sort of weight, and the one on the lever 
has a lever that might have once been controlled by some sort of cable, but 
that's long gone.  Can someone explain what these two flaps do and how I should 
be setting the one on the left?  Or point me to some obvious reference that 
has so far escaped me?

Thanks a bunch.

See you on the road,
Jerry
'70 bus w/ new Mexican engine


&gt; A little history:  I have a 71 Westy, stock 1600 DP
&gt; setup.  Runs like a champ, never let me down. However,
&gt; I always had trouble on the interstate with engine oil
&gt; temps.  I could drive back roads and stop &amp; go for
&gt; hours and never get an oil temp higher than 200
&gt; degrees, BUT, whenever I drove at a sustained speed of
&gt; 55 MPH for longer than 20 minutes, my oil temp would
&gt; creep up over 220 degrees. Whenever it got this hot I
&gt; ALWAYS backed off to about 50 MPH, and it dropped
&gt; right back down.  I have done everything right, all
&gt; engine seals in place, change oil MORE than necessary,
&gt; kept valves adjusted perfectly and regularly. BUT,
&gt; whenever I drove at sistained speds of 55 for any
&gt; length of time, the oil temp reached 220 degrees.  I
&gt; did all my research and couldn't find any problems, so
&gt; I just accepted that this is how hot my engine runs.  
&gt; I see myself as a fairly knowledgeable person
&gt; regarding the mechanics of a bus, and I have been on
&gt; this T2 &amp; VB list for about 3 years, BUT I never knew
&gt; until two days ago (after someone on the list
&gt; mentioned it) that 71's have a thermostacally
&gt; controlled flap in the air cleaner assembly which
&gt; changes the intake air flow path from the heat riser
&gt; tube in cold weather, to cold air intake form the
&gt; engine compartment. Well, my flap was stuck in the
&gt; cold weather position, so basically all my intake air
&gt; was coming form the heat riser tube!  So I got it open
&gt; and too kthe bus on the interstate for about 50
&gt; minutes of 60 MPH sustained speed. The oil temp
&gt; hovered around 190-210, never made it past 210
&gt; degrees!!
&gt; Woohoo! This is going to make long trips much easier!!!
