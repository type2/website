Subject: engine hatch seal won't hold still

Howdy.  I'm putting my RMMW engine hatch seal on, and it seems to fit
beautifully, EXCEPT that the groove in the rubber doesn't fit snug enough
over the body lip to hold the seal in place, expecially across the top.  As
far as I know, the rear has never been hit, all original there.  Experienced
body folk:  do you ever install hatch rubber with a little smear of some
adhesive in the body channel?  I'm putting the rubber in now to get back on
the road.  Rust has been abused and treated, but not final painted, so I'd
like to install without having to de-goo in the future.  Suggestions?
