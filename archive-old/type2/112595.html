Thats what I'm talking about and it seems like they do interfere. I've looked 
at the 009 and the clamp rode up on the housing about an eighth of an inch on 
the housing of the 009, where the &quot;nubs&quot; are on the stock dizzy. I've spun the 
pinion, visualised, and given it a pretty good shove once aligned and it still 
won't drop in with the clamp on.
