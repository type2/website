Subject: Distributors 009 to stock?
Date: Wed, 9 May 2001 21:42:41 +0100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In my early days of owning &quot;Polly&quot; with her 1800 Twin carb Type V1 engine
(manual trans).  I was trying to cure a poor running fault and changed my
stock dizzy for a 009.  I am now much wiser (I think - and thanks to you
chaps).  I have the engine on the garage floor for some work. Before putting
it back in the bus should I

1. Re-install the stock dizzy (seems a bit worn to me)

2. Buy another (new) stock dizzy

3. Is it possible to use parts from the 009 to rebuild the stock dizzy (I
read in the library of something like this the other way around)

Any thoughts?
