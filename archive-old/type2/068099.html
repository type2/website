Subject: Finally Rebuilding my 1600!

Hi folks,

It's been over a year since I stripped down the original engine from my '71
with the intention of rebuilding it well in advance of the demise of my
current engine.  What I have accomplished so far is completely derusting and
repainting all the dual port tin and making various lists of parts I need,
which I misplace after a few months, and then make new lists.  So today is
special because I'm actually starting to buy what I've feverishly scribbled
on these lists!  I've placed an order with Berg for a camshaft, lifters,
piston set, oil pump and assorted seals.  Berg's prices on stock replacement
parts are in line with RMMW prices--it's when you start wanting the exotic
stuff that Berg gets really expensive.   Given the bad experiences people
have had recently with out of spec new lifters from certain parts suppliers,
I decided to go with the Berg Pick of the Litter assurance (and cross my
fingers).  I've also packaged up my rods, crank, and case to send out to
Rimco for machining.  I expected to have this engine rebuilt and in my bus
last spring, but my current engine refuses to die--forcing me to
procrastinate ;).

As this project moves along I'll post the costs involved in machining and my
parts laundry list and prices for a stock 1600cc rebuild.  Probably the only
modification I'll make will be the full flow filter.  I think the Berg kit
comes with 8mm ID hoses, but Bob's recommendation of the 1/2&quot; ID sounds more
convincing so that's the path I'll take.  

I spent last night perusing Fisher's &quot;How to Hot Rod&quot; book.  I wouldn't
recommend reading the section on how a huge percentage of New, stock VW
crankshafts aren't straight and quickly lead to a trashed case when you're
just about to go to sleep and you're already fidgety about getting the best
parts without going broke.  I think the advice about cranks is probably most
relevant to high RPM race engines (at least that's how I finally got to
sleep).  In any event, my crank is getting ground (like my teeth!).

The current engine in my bus I assembled 6 years ago from a Mofoco
shortblock ($259), JC Whitney piston set ($80), and single port heads
rebuilt by a friend.  Basically I slapped this engine together without
knowing/caring about deck height, balancing, full flow etc. and it's lasted
me 70k miles (which proves what you don't know won't hurt you ;).  The
bottom end has 70k miles on it and the heads 55k (only 5k from the dreaded
60k mile #3 exhaust valve drop curse!).  The crank endplay is now out to
.020&quot; and it is not correctible (crank siezes when shims are used to bring
endplay back to spec).  I have been good at maintaining proper endplay and
replacing my front oil seals at regular intervals during the life of this
engine.  I expect this engine to sieze up/drop a valve/implode at about 80k
miles, but we'll see!  

Now that I've eaten from the tree of knowledge (planted by God and
fertilized by Hoover and Berg--ok, maybe weeded by Muir ;), I'll be spending
more time, effort and money on this next rebuild.  Hopefully 100k miles from
now, I'll have data to compare the cheapo-let's get this bus on the
road-rebuild, with the loving care-ok, so I'll have to fast every couple
days to afford this-rebuild!

In other news, at a yard sale I picked up an old 1/8 HP motor and belt drive
pulley fixture to operate grinding and wire wheels.  For $10 it came with a
bunch of grinding, wire and cutting wheels.  It's a little weak, but just
what I need for sharpening chisels and grinding miscellanea. 
I also made a nice wiring harness for my auxilliary gauges (oil temp and
pressure and soon a cyl head temp) with different colored wires and soldered
connections--high tech!  I hope to have that installed this week so I can
begin collecting data on my tired engine so I'll have some readings to
compare to the new engine. 

Keep you posted!
