Subject: Brake Booster

I have built my type two engine up with Dellorto Twin chokes, on aluminium
aftermarket manifolds, and was wondering if those &quot;big&quot; bosses on the stock
intake manifolds are for the brake booster vacuum ports, and if they are, how
does one get the Vacuum port for this service, on aftermarket manifolds.  The
motor is the 1.8 L.  That was initially carbuerreted.  Thought someone else
might have &quot;engineered&quot; around this.  Thanks
Sid
