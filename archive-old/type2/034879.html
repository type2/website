Gentlepersons-
                       ...Drop that torch! Thoroughbred &amp; Classic Cars has a 
pic of a split-
screen on page 184 of the Jan. issue. Went for 3045 pounds (about $4,900 
American),
and &quot;...thankfully, it has been spared the custom treatment...&quot;
                       It did, however, receive a &quot;sympathetic 
renovation&quot;...For which I'm sure
it was very grateful.
