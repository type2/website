Subject: stalls out only first time driven each day

Hi all! I have an 80 Vanagon-Roger. It has an aircooled 2.o liter fi
motor. Lately it has been stalling out about 2 or 3 blocks from home,
when I stop for a stop sign. It only does this the first time i's driven
each day. It takes me anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes to get it to start
again, and then it's fine the rest of the day. It has a new fuel pump
and filter as of June. I changed the filter again this morning to see
what that does. It doesn't matter if it's early in the day and kinda
cool, or noontime and hot, the first trip is probably gonna be a little
longer than planned. Anybody have any suggestions what might be going
on? Thanks for the help,
Mike Byrd
80 Vanagon Roger
