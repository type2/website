A deep sump might run a bit cooler due to greater surface area, but I
cannot see how it could have a major effect on temperature.  More oil
doesn't mean it runs cooler, only that changes in temperature take a bit
longer.

Disadvantages:

Loss of ground clearance
More joints to leak
More waste oil to deal with.

IF you're looking to lower oil temperatures, and your tin and seals are in
good order it would be wiser to work on the cooler.  Either go to (in
order of difficulty) a close-fin type III cooler (no tin mod), a type IV
cooler (some tin mods) or a full flow cooler plumbed into the oil
gallery.
