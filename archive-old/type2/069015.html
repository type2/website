&gt; thanks to all who posted info on a tire carrier.  Turns out that there isn't

&gt;  All carriers I found needed extra holes drilled.  How sad.  Seems to be the
&gt; consensus that the 3 emblem holes would'n't hold the tire by themselves
&gt; anyway.

Our 67 came with a front tire carrier that used the same holes as the 
Large emblem. The holes were slightly enlarged for it, and mounted with 
fender washers inside the nose skin. If this would work for yours(I don't 
know your year) you can have it. Note, of course it works on 5 bolt 
pattern wheels. I could check its fit on later, 4 bolt rims. Let us know.
