X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

&gt;it is said:
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; _Real_ TSP is available and is the preferable material.
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, large commercial greenhouses often have a washtub of TSP
&gt;in solution for a quick handwashing before touching the plants.
&gt;Kills tobacco mosaic virus, inter alia, which is not something
&gt;you want spreading in an acre of hothouse tomatoes, say.

My father used to take stuff to a radiator shop, they had some sort 
of dip tank for cleaning parts. Not only did my father take in engine 
parts, he would have them dip wood furniture prior to refinishing and 
let me tell you that stuff came back looking like new wood.

Anyway, I have been using a steam cleaner bay at the auto hobby shop 
on a local military base. You have to let the fog clear now and then, 
but it works pretty well. The water/grease/oil mixture drains into a 
separator so I feel better about keeping storm drain pollution under 
control.
