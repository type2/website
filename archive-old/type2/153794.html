Subject: Re: [T2] 3rd wire on left goes where?

From Mike Benthin:

 (I sent a pic to Karl)
On the left side of the 78 engine below the doublerelay is a part of the
stock harness with 3 black wires coming out of it- one goes through the
inline fuse and out to + on the distr; the other comes from the double
relay to the outlet of the fuse holder, and the third ??? went where?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

I pmailed Mike that the 3rd wire goes to the back-up light switch on the transmission. It comes out of the
fused end.

Power starts at the 15 term of the coil, goes to the two wire end of the in-line fuse, un-fused power goes to
the double relay, fused power goes to the reverse light switch.

In-line fuse holder:  The two wire end is the inlet side, the one wire end is the outlet side.
