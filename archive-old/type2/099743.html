I nominate Richard for best photographer on the type2 list.

&gt;I bet it would be hard to find a gear in anyone's bus that isn't cracked a
&gt;little unless it's low mileage.

Mine isn't cracked... because it's made of metal!  :) 

I have a Vanagon speedo in my bus and after driving about 8,000 miles with it I noticed my gas mileage had dropped off considerably.  Turns out the crack in the gear had caused the odometer to stop briefly once each mile.  I love the Vanagon speedo and didn't want to go back to the original one so I made a serious effort to fix the problem.

Step 1: Try to use the gear from the original '73 speedo - nope, different tooth count.

Step 2: Call speedo repair shop.  Yes they can fix it, for about $100.  I tell them I only need one gear but they won't sell it to me, I have to pay the full $100.  No thanks.

Step 3: Try to find a good gear from another Vanagon speedo.  Nope, pulled nearly a dozen at the yards and every single gear was cracked to some extent.

Step 4: Back to the yards to find another vehicle that uses the same gear.  Checked every model of VW, none matched.  No luck with Audis either.  Next was BMW - pulled many speedos in 2002s and 3-series with no luck, then right when I was about to give up I found a metal gear in an older model sedan that was a perfect match.  

I've put at least 50k miles on it since with no problems at all.  I'm sorry to say that I don't remember the exact model.  I would guess mid-late 70's, either one of the earliest 5-series, or a 633 or similar.  After installing the gear, my mileage improved to &quot;bad&quot;, up from horrible.

So you can either pay the speedo shop $100 for a 20-cent gear or you can travel to San Diego and spend a few weeks tearing dashboards apart in the junkyard.  It would be nice if someone could find another source for those gears.
