Subject: Re: [T2] cold start injector

Phil, I agree that the problem obviously isn't the cold start valve. The problem is that's what the original poster has a spare of, therefore the solution! If it only worked that way.

From: phil cain &lt;bearsvw2000_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;
&gt;The only time the valve works is when it is cold, I &gt;think around 34 degrees,

Celcius? I thought it was below 70dF....

&gt;and then only as long as the starter is
&gt;engaged.

Err, Doesn't the thermo-time switch operate it by grounding it only at certain low temps, and then only for a maximum time length? Hence thermo-time switch.

Billy
