&gt; 1.  how long can I leave the fridge on?  Will the battery go dead?

You should have a second battery that runs the fridge.  That battery will
generally go dead after 4-8 hours.  My experience has been that the amount
of cooling provided by the battery alone is so little that it's not even
worth leaving the fridge on while parked.  I do run it while driving,
although it does little more then.  What I mainly rely on for colling is ice
in sturdy ziploc bags.  I save the fridge battery mainly to jumpstart the
car if the main battery runs down!

&gt; 2.  Where can I buy a new water pump for the sink?

Bus Depot carries these.

&gt; 3.  The propane tank may have a leak or need to be tightened in
&gt; one spot, b/c when i turn the gas on, white fumes leak (hiss) out
&gt; of the pipe running from the tank-- should I be able to show this
&gt; by anyone at a propane shop?

I had to replace some parts in the propone system when I bought my bus
(1988), and I got the parts at an RV supply place IIRC.  I have heard that
standards may be changing and the Westfalia system may no longer be up to
code - anyone know about this?
