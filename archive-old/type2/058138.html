Michael,

Your '75 is the last year of the 002 style transaxles
and is a one year only style case.  Some budget
minded offroad folks like to use this 002 as the extra
beefy ribbing on the 'pyramid' case was the best the
002 came with.  

Enough of that....  Does it lock up everytime in 2nd
or just sometimes?  Have you drained the gear oil?
If so, was there a grey paste on the magnetic plug
or 'major chunkage'?  Lots of gold color (brass) in
gear oil?  Does it grind when it does not want to go 
into 2nd or does it feel like you are trying to shift into 
a wall-like something keeping you out of the gear?  
First gear OK?  No problems either upshifting or 
downshifting? 

Let me know and we can ponder this some more.
