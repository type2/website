Subject: Tranny Mount

sorry to have to repost this but it's getting cold out and I need to get
my bus on the road.  I need a front tranny mount for my '74 westy.  I
have switched for auto to manual.  If anyone knows of any junk yards in
MD or VA that might have this I would really appreciate the info.
Thanks
Frankie
