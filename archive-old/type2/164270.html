Subject: Mystery diagnosis

If your solenoid &quot;clicks&quot; at key turn, and your battery is at charge, then
maybe your starter solenoid Kaput.  Start from this basic, then if it spins
over, and won't start, it has to be in the coil, dizzy, &quot;site&quot;, and after that
progress to wires plugs, etc, even if they have been replaced.  Electricity,
is like water in a hose, give it a chance to &quot;getout&quot; and it will, with
recurrent problems from there on.
