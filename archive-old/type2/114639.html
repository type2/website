Subject: 77 Auto Bus with 75 FI

Hi Volks,

Further research and development on my wife's 77 Sunroof Automatic bus 
has determined that the spare engine I (and a bunch of local 
bus-fiends) installed last week is a 2L VW of Canada remanufactured 
engine with a 1975 FI setup. I replaced the 77 ECU in the bus with the 
correct 75 unit.

On removing the original 2L/Single Weber engine (with 2 blown valves on 
#1 cylinder I discovered the P.). has done a lot of auxilary wiring. 
Some of it was for the Non-FI fuel pump and much of it is unknown at 
this point. before pulling it I did get the original engine running by 
jumping the starter.

This afternoon I wired up the FI and connected all the vacuum lines, 
and applied power to the starter. The engine turns over but does not 
fire.  There is no spark and no fuel pressure. I couldn't see any 
polarity indicated on the wires leading to the fuel pump, but I still 
have to check there for voltage anyway.

IIRC, the power flows as follows:
Ignition -&gt; starter -&gt; Double relay -&gt; Coil&amp;Fuel Pump. Guess I better 
put a long lead on my test light.

If anyone's been down this road and has pointers to share, please feel 
free to let me know how it went, and what to look out for.

Happy trails,
