Ah, Jessca, your first bus disagreement. Nice.
	The thing to percieve in a vw bus when reversing is that your backside is
directly above the front wheel. Go somewhere and practice. Have fun....
	Barry Wright
P.S. contemplate the consequences of geting busted in an unregistered and
uninsured bus. Or worse trashing somebodys Rolls...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i have just bought a bus an hour away from where i live it is unreg
&gt; with no roadworthy certificate. Previous owner drive it to mechanic,
&gt; which is close by. Needs it front disc brake pad replaced and horn
&gt; repaired, hopefully it will pass the roadworthy test then. Should i
&gt; bother getting the rego for one day or take a chance driving it home
&gt; (take about 1 and a half)? Nearly $40 for one day rego.
&gt;
&gt; Keeping in mind i have little experience driving buses. What do you
&gt; think, i am inclined to stuff the rego but my boyfriends wants to
&gt; play it safe. We are buying the bus together
&gt;
