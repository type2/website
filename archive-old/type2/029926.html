&gt; By looking at the last one I've seen, it must also have the &quot;added on&quot; sheet

Hard to find.  It is basically a bug part with additional sheet metal
added on to produce the desired profile.

You can go in one of three ways:

1. Get luck and acquire the correct '71 only front tin.
2. Get a doghouse bug front tin and add the sheet metal (not too hard, as
it is just a flat piece with a flange)
3. Get a non-doghouse bus front tin and add the doghouse exhaust hole.
