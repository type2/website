 Thanks all, for the great ideas on how to power the=20
gymnastic CD player.         =20
I think the solution for me is to put an extra interior =20
light switch on the left of the dash next to the stock =20
one, I'll wire this between the aux. battery and the=20
ignition lead.

 HEY, WAIT A MINUET!.... won't this send power=20
back thru the fuse block and power-up anything on
that circuit?

Jak (obviously not an electrician) =20
