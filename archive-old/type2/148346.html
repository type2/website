Hi Todd,

I have been using that pump with dual carbs with no problems.

 currently have a mechanical pump installed on my car and instead use a

stripped
 (76 Camaro).

 Do you think that is sufficient enough to be used with my dual carb setup? I
 have these two realy nice carbs, and I really think I want to install them
now.
