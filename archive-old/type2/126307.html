Subject: RE: [T2] Hydraulic lifters - mistake to replace?

Boy, oh boy...

I miss a digest or two, and the pooh totally hits the oscillating
blades!

Bob - a big THANK YOU to your well reasoned and thoughtful response to
the engineering issues associated with bus pilot-age, but I would be
really careful about admitting to Jake's e-face that I was an engineer.
He &quot;hates&quot; those guys, 'cause they're in league with the Evil One.  Jake
may/mayn't have Super-Powers.  Better get your aluminum foil hat on...

Richard - sign me up for some of them ceramic hydraulics too!  That is
such a kewl idea - think of the possibilities!  Cams and lifters that
will last 'til the next Ice Age, and will only require checking once or
twice a century :-)  Likewise - get yer aluminum foil hat ready...

David - You better be careful racin' Jake with the 'Stang, I &quot;heard&quot;
that he raced some guy in GA one time and made the guy's motor blow up
just by looking in the rear view mirror.  It was all over the STF - so
it must have been true.   Three words for you, buddy - Aluminum.  Foil.
Hat...

BTW - who's the admin-on-duty?  Would someone puh-leaze remind Mr. Raby
of the Type 2 List charter...  He did us all a great service with his
two posts over the last couple of weeks on the Type 4 head issues, but
nobody (I don't think) on this list is all about spankin' rice with a
hi-po bug or 'teening on the track with the big boys.  I'll posit that
more than just a few of us here are more the &quot;Hoover Endurance Run&quot;
types.  Keep &quot;The Fist and The Felching&quot; chat elsewhere, m'kay?  It's
kewl and all reading about it, but where's the bus content?  Speaking of
which - buses with an SVDA or a DVDA (instead of an 009/050) and a CDI
box installed will get better gas mileage.  I've been running the
Comp-u-fire points replacement rigs in my various Type 4 powered
vehicles - the only dead one is one I accidentally killed &lt;doh!&gt; when I
hooked up the loom to the relay board on my 914 while the board was
powered up.  The only two Pertronix units I've had the (dis)pleasure of
meeting had life-spans of 15 seconds and 15 minutes respectively.

So, in summary - to my esteemed colleagues, engineers, rocket scientists
(we still got any rocket scientists on board?), regular scientists,
computer scientists, statisticians, critical thinkers, college
granulates, ladies/germs and fellow bus pilots; I leave you with the
following thoughts.  You best be careful talking all that high falutin'
statistical analysis, causality, tribology, and experimental
design/testing standards with Jake - he usta be a Marine, and I &quot;heard&quot;
that he looked long enough and hard enough in the direction of a pesky
former customer in Puerto Rico, an' the guy didn't have HIS aluminum
foil hat on, an' the poor guy went crazy, an' then he pulled the trigger
on himself and quit the oxygen habit...  He can do it - it was on the
STF.  You've been warned :-)

Now ducking/covering, fashioning an aluminum foil hat of my own,
sprinkling a circle of salt, and saying the Rosary...  it's been nice
know you-all, and with that - I take your leave.

A Bus Pilot
