Subject: hydraulic valve lifters

i just adjusted my valves (~500 miles since rebuild). The Bentley said that for hydraulic valve lifters...all you need do is adjust them for zero clearance and then 2 more turns clockwise and then lock them down with the nut. Is this right? Tighten them? sounds odd to me. I have not driven it since adjustment...just moved the van to another spot. Sounded noisy and then quieted down some. I don;t think it is as quiet as it was after the rebuild. Anyone have any experience with this?
 
Many thanks,
Colby
