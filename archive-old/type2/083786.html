Subject: Whining (not me, the bus)

I'm hearing a whirring, whining noise from the engine
at high rpms. (its eclipsed by the engine noise at
speed, but noticable if i rev at idle, 1st or R. Seems
to be coming from the generator.

I'm getting plenty of juice. Nothing smells amiss and
the belt is not shiny.

Is a bearing going out on my generator or is this just
a natural sound (has about 12,000 miles on it.)?
