Anyone out there have an accurate wiring diagram for a mid-'70's Westfalia?
I have a bundle of wires (and a relay) on the left side of my '75
Westfalia's engine compartment, but I don't know what wires should have gone
to the FI that vanished years ago and which go to the camper gear.  I'd
really like my fridge and sink to operate when I'm not plugged in to shore
power.  I'd gladly accept scanned or faxed info if it's available!

Also - I've replaced a bad battery, r&amp;r'd the alternator with a good spare
(not as bad as I though the job would be) and the voltage regulator, and I
still have the alternator light glowing all the time.  The VO meter says
it's charging.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.
