Subject: RE: PopTop Seal--Prices!!


Boy! Was I off on the price for the Black Pinch on rubber, metal enforced,
and,-with the crush rubber seal!   It fit on to my Puck pop-top, Perfect,
and I am sure it would work for your pop-top camper--The cost was $12.00 for
16 feet of it!!! If anyone wants any I will get it for you--just let me know
the length--I can bring to Pomona,  Or if you really need it I will ship for
shipping costs! This is Not Junk!! It is Automotive Quality--On Monday I
will go to the place and check on the door rubber--I think it only comes in
Black  stay tuned--TWWM, uj
