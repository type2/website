Subject: Dbl Door Rescue (pt1) long

Yesterday (after following up on a few leads) we arrived at a fellow's farm
just a scant 35 miles from our boneyard.... Seems this fellow had for sale
an older bus which due to a recent and untimely divorce he needed to get 
rid of.

Following directions to an unknown area of rural Florida is always a
challange as the landmarks given usually go something like &quot;Take the
first left past the tree with three cows grazing under it&quot; or &quot;look for an old
barn which leans towards, you know,  the way the sun sets, what's that?,
yeah, West, I guess !...&quot;

After a few stops and a few more misturns we wound up at a place that
resembled the fellow's destination. Saw a few Beetle noses poking out
from behind a corner of a dilapadated cow barn, and the obligatory bad
dog which nipped at our elbows (tall dog!). I fed him what was left of my
7-11 hot-dog (always bring an offering to appease  potential watch-critters)
and after giving the him the secret handshake he allowed us to scatter-
walk up the winding cow trail to what appeared to be the fellow's trailer.

Trailers in Rural Florida scare the Hell out of me. `Specially in areas like
this where the random grouping of an intersection, Convienance Store,
and Self-serve car wash constitute a bonifide &quot;City&quot; in the minds of most
locals. All trailers here leave their front door open, some don't even have
the front door still on hinges (in which case you'll usually find it being used 
as a ramp to the gaping front door opening, which I gather allows them to
wheel their sat dish in and out in bad weather).

Houses and conventional &quot;Farms&quot; use the &quot;Hey Neighbor&quot; approach to
greeting potential residents. You stand at the fence, creak open the gate,
and holler &quot;Hey Neighbor&quot;.  Most times you get a response after a minute
or two from the SO who greets you at the front door wiping her (or his)
hands on a kitchen towel.  Trailers (without front doors) are taken with a
great deal of caution even IF you are being expected, and especially if you
have long hair and happen to be driving a late model American car that
can be mistaken for a ATF vehicle. Trailer people (TP's) also have a need
to holler, and usually not within the line of sight.  After trying our &quot;Hey
Neighbor&quot; greeting we waited stoically at the remnants of the gate for a
response. After a long pause (which gave the dog time to finish gulping his
offering and come bounding up behind us) we hear someone from inside
the trailer scuffle around and yell &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Here to see the bus&quot; I replied, Silence....... Dog's getting edgy after hearing
his master's voice but seeing no master... Starts looking at us like we might
just be  ATF agents and begins to growl the &quot;earn my keep&quot; growl. I start
fishing in my pockets for the sugar cubes I brought for &quot;mean Horses&quot; hoping
he has a sweet tooth.

&quot;You gottha wrong place, up the road, turn at the Smith's place&quot; the voice from
the trailer replies. The Dog turns friendly again. We say &quot;thanks&quot; and quickly
retreat to the relative safety of the waiting rescue vehicle (engine still
running)!
