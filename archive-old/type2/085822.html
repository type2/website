Subject: door locks, '71

The passenger and driver side door locks are problematic on my '71. I've 
replaced both exterior handle/ locksets and the door locks/ levers function 
great operated from the interior, so something is wrong w/ the mechanism in 
the door, I'm guessing. My machanic replaced a spring that he said was 
problematic and it worked great for 10 minutes! Any wisdom from experienced 
lock surgeons? Thanks, Craig
