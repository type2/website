Subject: Re: XM Radio

&gt;I was wondering what exactly is XM radio?

It's satalite broadcast digital subscription radio. Here's a link that
gives you a straightforward recent rundown on the two major players and
the costs. You don't actually need to buy any certain stereo as their
units plug in to your tape player, but that means the quality of your
current system will determine the quality of your sound.
