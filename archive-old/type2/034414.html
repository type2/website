Subject: diesel

I read somewhere (know idea where, it was a while ago) that diesel is often
used to clean out reg. unleaded engines. where you would fill it up and just
let the diesel run through and once you get past all the white smoke and
bucking youd have a cleaner engine. Im not sure of the validity of that, but
it shouldnt kill your engine, just anoy the hell outta you.
