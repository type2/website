You have to keep in mind, you are trying to cool an uninsulated greenhouse
down from 110 plus on a good day to say around 80 in minutes!!  Try that
with 7,500 BTU and it will not make it until the outside temps come down
along with the sun.

Those of us who remember the bus AC's when they were new can tell you the
stock system of I believe 12,000 BTU never did a very good job, just
minimal.  I would love to have a new 32,000 BTU unit, it would cool down
fast, then hold the temps even with the hottest sun shinning in all those
windows.

&gt; Gang:
&gt; 
&gt; 7,500 BTUs cools 14 Compaq Servers in a 10x10x10 area that I have as a
&gt; server room.  4 times that would probably be overkill for a van.
