I'm sorry to bother you with a private post but my reply keeps bouncing.  I
don't even know if the fellow is a subscriber.

 In a message dated 96-11-19 01:09:14 EST, you write:
 
 &lt;&lt; 
  I have a 79 transporter that is having some minor electrical glitches.
  When operating the turn signal the red battery light illuminates faintly
  is this because of the extra long distance that the electrical current
  must travel to reach the front turn lights?&gt;&gt;
 
 I doubt it, but I can't really say without more data.  If that is the only
 time you see the charge indicator lamp glow it may indicate a short in
 your turn-signal/emergency flasher relay or corrosion in your turn signal
switch.  There are a number of other
 possible causes but they would be accompanied by other symptoms in addition
 to those you've stated.  And don't ask me to list them -- the decision tree
 for debugging electrical problems has at least a hundred branches :-)
  
  &gt;&gt;Problem #2 
  After driving long distances (200+ miles), the van will fail to start
  once the ignition is turned off.  I thought my starter may be getting
  too hot and tripping a &quot;breaker&quot; so I ran a wire directly from my
  battery to the starter.  The wire is connected to the starter and
  dangles loose near the battery.  When it will not start I have to use
  my&quot;hot wire&quot; to get it going how can this problem be fixed? Why does it
  occur? &lt;&lt;
 
 How did it get started to
 begin with?  Are you saying there is a cooling off period involved?  If so,
 the symptoms could have several causes but it's most likely you have a bad
 ignition switch.
 
 Sorry I can't be of more help but I can't make bread without flour :-)

PS -- To All:

After re-reading this it occurred to me that the last time I saw BOTH a
flakey turn signal AND a balky starter it was due to the owner's habit of
drinking slurpies while he drove.  And spilling a drop now and then.  The
sugary residue had completely ruined all of the electrical terminals in his
steering column. - rsh
