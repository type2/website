Subject: Re: [T2] Electric fuel pumps

&gt;   All I see on here is everybody bashing these pumps.


Well, obviously they couldn't be 100% trash or they wouldn't be making them
anymore. Some decent ones have to be made.

But mine lasted only a couple months. Others I've spoken to who have or had
them have a range of experiences. Like your successes, to pumps that lasted
days.

Pertronix is the same kind of thing. There will be good experiences and bad
ones.

This is just the nature of inexpensive manufacturing.
