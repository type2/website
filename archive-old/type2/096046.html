Subject: re: Bus Sighting movies Update

&gt; OK I finally tracked down the Charlie's Angels movie here at work.

[...]

&gt; What a waste of a good bus!

FWIW, it may not have even been a straight, complete, or running bus.
It's easy to make a trashed beater look good enough for one or two camera
angles for 3 seconds at 50 feet.  Might've been a rustbucket with bad
rear torsion housing. :-)

I don't mean to excuse 'em for creaming what might have been straight,
torchable body panels -- just that I've seen &quot;how they done it&quot; specials
where you realize how easy it is to make beaters look like good cars just
long enough.
