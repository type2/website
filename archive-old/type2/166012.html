&gt; Has anyone checked their front wheel bearings? If so, how big a job is it.

It's not a horribly difficult job, but it can be somewhat tricky to get 
the old bearing seats out.  I used a large flathead screwdriver and 
deadblow mallet.  Then to press them back in, I took the old seat, 
ground the OD down about .5mm and used it as a mandrel to press the new 
seat into place using my vice.  A hydraulic press would have made things 
much easier.

Unless you have all the right tools and know exactly what you're doing 
(which usually isn't the key), then creativity is your friend.
