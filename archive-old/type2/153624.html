Subject: Battery vs. Alternator (Follow-up)

Reporting back:
I took it to another shop (good choice too) to have it inspected.  Basically
the sparkplugs in 3 &amp; 4 were not tight (4 was totally loose) and the dwell
was _at_ 70 instead of 59.  Mech is going to give me a whole tune-up in that
area.  Plus he is going to make sure all connections are good &amp; clean.

He ruled out the alternator right off the bat while I was in the shop with
him the other day.  He is going to check the starter/fuel pump and other
parts just to make sure that they are good and in working order.

Also, while I was there, I told him about my brakes.  Said the rear ones are
20% hence the e-brake won't work.  Front ones are 75%.  He is going to
replace that, the shoes and the bearings.  Says while its there, it's what
he does since it's easy.

He is also going to upgrade the front lights that I have (one is out) to
halogen for $70.  Just a replacement light is $30.  He is going to throw in
the chrome covers that are newer and not rusty for free because of all the
work I brought him.

I like this guy.  He really knows his stuff.  Once repairs are all done, I
will report back more in-depth, but just wanted to follow-up.

This shop is in Oregon, and I think that I found a good mech who tells you
like it is.  He spent 10 minutes on the phone with me explaining everything.

Hi Adam,

If you're having problems with charging and also intermittent non-
start problems, it sounds like you should investigate the quality of
all your high-voltage connections.

One corroded or loose link in the chain could easily cause BOTH of
these problems. Here's the path:


Do this BEFORE you have them replace anything expensive. You might
also consider replacing the tranny ground strap and battery terminal
wires while you're at I
