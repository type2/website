Subject: 1776 aspirations

&gt; OK, folks.. Get ready for some dumb questions.
&gt; A. Can a 1776 engine be run with a Solex single carb of any type?  &gt; (I do
not expect screaming performance, and I want to keep it as   &gt; simple as
possible).

I had a Solex single progressive for a while on my 1835 DP.  Ran OK but had
a problem with running too rich, maybe a stuck float valve, I would be glad
to sell you the one I have so I can get rid of it.

Three choices I would offer:

	1.  Dual Kadrons
	2.  Dual Weber ICT's
	3.  Dual Dellorto 34 FRDs

The Kadrons are easiest to find new but I don't know much else about them.
The Webers and the Dells are simple and very similar--34mm, single throat,
no choke.  I am running the Dells (&quot;Baby Dells&quot;) now and am very pleased.
Took a while to locate the linkage pieces and set up but it is a wonderful
difference. (hauls)

Don't be afraid of dual carbs, buy a good synchronizer and plunk down the
cash for the setup.  There are lots of dual carbs for sale on thesamba_dot_com
at reasonable prices.

&gt; B. Can a 1776 engine be retrofitted for fuel injection?

yes, but does not comply with your &quot;simple as possible&quot; objective.
