Casey,

Try replacing the rotor in the distributor, id probably do the cap to at
the same time but that is just me. I remember reading somewhere that
there is a resistor(?) in the rotor under that black filling. That would
be where I would start since you are getting a nice spark to the
distributor and not out of it.

Subject: [T2] Pertronix coil Help

I was driving yesterday and my coil fell of and shorted a fuse hence
causing 
my car to come to a stop. I tried another coil and I am getting spark.
When 
I pull the wire off the distributor it shoots a nice blue spark but when
I 
pull a spark plug theres no spark. Could the distributor have burned up.

Wouldnt there be no spark from the coil if that were the case. The car
was 
running great until the coil fell and left me on the side of the road 
getting blown away by mac trucks.

Casey
