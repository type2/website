Subject: Winnebego Conversions?

I am consideriing buying a '78 camper conversion. The owner says 
Winnebego did it. It is kind of ugly brown and wood grain. There is a
empty space behind the front passenger seat next to the sliding door.
The owner says the stove and ice-box was there (there is a propane tank 
under the sliding door and behind the front seat where the stove  
supposably goes some hook-ups which look like they are for the stove, 
also an electrical outlet there too) The sink and closet are behind the 
driver's seat. The bed is split in half so you can fold down a half at a 
time and have somebody sleep while another sits on the back seat. The 
pop-top has a snap on flap to seal it when it is down which the owner 
says Westies don't have. Also the pop-top isn't canvas but is a plastic 
material. Any info or ideas/tips on who canverted this 
or on fixing it up would be appreciated. Thanks.
                                                       Simon
