&lt;&lt;  Black PVC caps from the plumbing supply house...About five cents

Got a pic?  Or a detailed description?

No but even Home Despot has PVC caps. They look just like tiny cups and 
are used to cap off a PVC pipe. I have M-B alloys on my Bus and use black
(though they usually come white, but are paintable body color). 1/2 inch
fits the standard lug nut, tap 'em on with a hammer handle. Mine've been
on for a couple thousand miles, but at a nickle each, you could change
your color scheme weekly for a buck... ;-)
