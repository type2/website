&lt;&lt;  I believe 10 mm but I don't know the pitch.

That seems like the size of the head rather than the screw.

ETKA says N 013 890 5 - tapping screw, hex.hd. ST6.3x13-C

I don't know how to read the tapping screw dimensions...
 &gt;&gt;

I'm probably wrong, but I think the belly pan uses a slot
headed screw with the threads that match the bolts
on the engine tin. The belly pan screws are tapered at
the tip and &quot;self tapping&quot; but I'm almost positive tin
bolts fit... ???
