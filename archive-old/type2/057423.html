Subject: Bus starts then dies

Hey folks,

I've got a 78 bus, 2.0L typeIV, stock FI.  One day two weeks ago,
the gas gauge went dead.  Next day, it wouldn't start.  I figured dead
battery.
When I finally got around to playing with it (Sunday), the auto shop
said the battery
was fine.  So I cleaned up terminals and connectors, and now bus will
crank.

BUT...

Since it had been sitting two weeks, and the starter isn't in the
greatest
condition, I didn't want to crank a long time till the fuel pressure got
up,
so I ran the fuel pump for 30 seconds before I tried to start it.  This
is
accomplished by shorting pins 36 and 39 on the AFM connector while
the ignition is ON.  Okay, so, battery's good, I've run the fuel pump, I
go
hit the starter, and the bus fires right up immediately.  And
immediately
dies.

Crank, crank, crank, won't restart.

Go run the fuel pump again, and it fires right up.  And immediately
dies,
and won't restart until I run the fuel pump again.

Anybody have any idea what's going on here?  It's not the fuel pump,
because
that clearly runs.  I think (but correct me if I'm wrong), it's not the
double relay,
because running the fuel pump from the AFM proves out the relay also (I
think).
And it's apparently not the fuel pressure regulator, because it holds
the fuel
pressure from the time I run the pump until I get the AFM reconnected,
walk
up front, and hit the starter.

Eh, it's probably not the fuel system at all.  I'm probably just leading
myself
on a wild goose chase, but if anyone has any suggestions, I'd be glad to
hear 'em.
