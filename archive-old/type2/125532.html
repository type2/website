Subject: Back From BusFusion! (Short trip report)

Hi Volks,

We just got in the door after a VWonderful time at BusFusion.

This year was made a little more exciting than usual when the westfakia 
shredded a throwout bearing about 50 miles from home. All of a sudden 
it just came apart, and the pedal went to the floor. I pulled over 
expecing to find a broken cable dangling at one end or the other, but 
was surprised (and concerned) to see that this was not the case. 
Something had gone wrong inside the bell housing.

I decided it was best that I would do my best to make the remaining 150 
miles of the trip sans clutch. Precision alignment of engine speed and 
vehicle speed to match a desired gear ratio would be required, but I 
have done this before and the worst traffic was already behind us.

Starting a bus in 1st gear isn't fun, but it can be done in a pinch. I 
was able to time the traffic lights and plan my route such that I only 
needed to shut the engine off three times... one of those was for fuel 
and another was for a meal stop. The other was unavoidable traffic, but 
it was not a problem to get going again.

Many many thanks must be given to Hans Brouwer, Frank Condelli, Ben 
Huot, and Cory Petrie, for the loan of tools, parts and assistance.

Also many thanks for the efforts of Frank and the BusFusion Commitee -- 
we had a great time and are looking forward to BF2005!

Two teaser pictures, then I have to hit the hay....
