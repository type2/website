Subject: Re: [T2] Oil pressure adjuster - opinions?

I believe you can only adjust the top presure not the low presure, don't
see how you can get more presure than what the pump is putting out.

no facts just what I have heard or believe,

&gt; I was talking my FLAPS dude about the low oil pressure in my '65 1500 and he suggested I try one of those gizmos that goes into the pressure relief location under 
&gt; the engine -- it lets you adjust the pressure rather than relying on a pre-set spring compression.  IIRC, these gizmos have been around for years -- I seem to recall 
&gt; one that went by the trade name &quot;press-a-just&quot; or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Snake oil?  Boon to mankind?  At $6, seems worth investigating before I replace the oil pump.  Opinions appreciated.
