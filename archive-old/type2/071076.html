Subject: auto tranny switch
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all, I'm planning on putting a 77 autotranny into a 74 bus and I have a 
few questions.  The Bentley manual doesn't cover the late autotranny, does 
anyone know where I could look for info?  What should I do to autotranny 
before putting it into 74 bus, i.e., new seals, drain transmission oil, etc.? 
 Is there any thing I should look for to that would give me a hint that this 
autotransmission is bad.  The PO gave me the line &quot;it was running fine when I 
parked her there in 1986.&quot;  Will the 77 autotranny work correctly if I'm not 
running FI but carb?  Has anyone on the list done this switch and If so does 
anything need modified or retrofitted.  Thanks in advance
