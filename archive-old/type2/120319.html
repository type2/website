Subject: Re: [T2] Diesel Engine for later type 2?

&gt;That very well may be the only diesel Bay in
existence. 

No, there are quite a few.  There is a webpage
out of Germany for a shop that specializes in
this.  I remember babelfishing it.  Someone on
this list or perhaps vanagon list posted it.  I
remember it had fan boltered radiators mounted
under the belly.  Unfortunately, I've changed
computers and no longer have the link.  Anyone?  

A late Mexican loaf would be very easily
converted to diesel.  Lets see... a Mexican
address and permits for short term entry renewed
every so often.  This may work now that I live
only 50 miles or so from the border.
