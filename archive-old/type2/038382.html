Subject: Info on the electric bus in the National Geographic for children magazine (NESEA tour)

I had a conversation tonight with Topher Waring, of Riverside School,
Lyndonville, VT 05851 tonight.  He's a shop teacher who yearly disassembles
and rebuilds an all electric 71 Westy with his middle school kids to run in
the NorthEast Sustainable Energy Association American Tour de Sol
(http://www.ipd.anl_dot_gov/ttrdc/research/student_competitions/tour_de_sol/amer
ican_tds.html).

Great guy, from one talk to him.  Basically, he got the kids (the kids, now)
to create a conversion plate from 1/2&quot; tempered aluminum, and bolts a 19 hp
electric motor onto the standard tranny (spline to spline fitting by a local
machine shop).  16 12v deep cycle batteries give it a working range of 52
miles, 72 max on 144V at 500A.  Solar panels on the roof are good for about
15% of the energy he needs for the tour, the rest is recharged on a wire at
the overnight stops.  The kids come along and do the explaining and upkeep.
During the school year it's used as a gofer vehicle for the school and as a
real school bus.

I recommend you check it out and send the school your beer money for next
Saturday night, check made out to Helios Project.  They started with a
standard bus and gutted the engine and tank.  The kids did the rest and it
looks great.  My hat's off to him.  His email is tymzdork_at_sover_dot_net .  Would
I make this up?
