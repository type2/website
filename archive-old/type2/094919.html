Subject: Re: [T2] Light additions, inverters



&gt;Number #1 question:  If I had a fully charged battery when I pulled into a 
&gt;camp site, how long could I keep the 8 watt/ 0.5 amp drop light on before I 
&gt;drained the battery too low to start the fuel
&gt;
I know this is an interesting concept. I like it. I just wanted to say, with 
no affiliation.....that the Busdepot   www.busdepot_dot_com has a sale on for 
the 2 battery conversion. You have to supply the second battery. I do not 
have one myself, so I am speculating that it would be nice, but I will say 
this.....I use a marine battery and it  sure whips the llama. Or to put it 
more bluntly: a marine battery can handle recharge. And ive never let a 
battery sit like this one, with full juice comming strong every time. It 
likes to charge back up. 2 of them would rock.
