Subject: Re: [T2] Bus Cover

Actually, my rear fender is kind of banged up because
of him whacking it with his SUV. I should be pissed,
but my wife already banged it up once when we ere
moving, so I am kind of over it. As long as the
damage stays on the lip of the tail end, it never
really
gets worse.
