Subject: Re: Help with replacing Westy top in 68...

&gt;I guess that makes the most sense. Have to admit, I've been tempted to
&gt;implement some velcro technology on that tent canvas. ;)

Seriously, you're reading my mind. I'll report with details once I make
sure this works, but the mesh I got was ridiculously cheap and it seems
very strong. I was thinking about a mostly-screen top for summer and an
all-canvas one for winter; velcro all around. Is that crazy?
