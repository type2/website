Subject: Anonymous threatening letters left on my bus... Advice?

I have had a similar situation in the Netherlands, which rumbled on 
for months. The police came and checked the van (t2 1979) at 
least 3 times that I know of, and found it registered and roadworthy 
and correctly parked each time. If you pay your taxes, you have 
the same rights as everyone else, VW or not. In my case, 
neighbours had all sorts of funny ideas about parking regulations 
for campers, which turned out to be either cancelled 10 years ago 
or purely imaginary. The only reason the police came several times 
was that one person in the PD didn't know what the other was 
doing.
