Does anyone have or know where I could get hold of the combustion blower
vane housing for a 79 auxillary heater.  I think the heater is a
Eberspacher BA6, not but I know it is the stock one for a 79' bus.  The
combustion blower vane housing is a little metal cone that goes between
the combustion blower and the body of the heater. I guess it is there to
protect the propelor on the combustion blower.  Mine is missing and I
can't seem to find a replacement.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
