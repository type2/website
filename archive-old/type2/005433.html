Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for 74 heat exchangers

&gt; I'm looking for a set of decent condition heat
&gt; exchangers for my 76 bus.  I'd like to put a set of 74
&gt; exchangers in, because they bolt right into the
&gt; manifold and simplify everything.  My exhast system
&gt; now has some leaks. All the flanges on the pipes were
&gt; badly bent and will still not seal well after having
&gt; been hammered and filed.  I'm also in need a a muffler
&gt; that would fit a 74 and a set of heater control boxes
&gt; (mine are rusted through and totally useless).  If
&gt; anyone has these to sell and lives near the boston
&gt; are, please let me know.

You need more than just heater boxes and a muffler if you are going this
route. You will also need:

the 72-74 lower tin

the lower front cylinder tin on each side from a 72-74

both left and right hot air pipes between the boxes and the flapper valves
from a 72-74, they are round....75 up are oval

both air pipes that go thru the upper cylinder tin and the blower fan
connect to

the alternator support, 72-74 bolts to the side of the heater box

Just buying boxes and a muffler is not going to get it.....
And what about EGR? Do you have it / need it for smog purposes? How about a
catalytic converter?
