&gt; Lord knows that after 700 posts on the issue, I still don't know when and for
&gt; what busses the 30 year cal smog thing applies.
&gt; 
&gt; I know I have to smog my bus now, a 76' in DEC 2002 per DMV, will I have to
&gt; smog again?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems like I would be due in  DEC 2004, but my bus will be exempt on Jan
&gt; 01, 2005 right? Is there a way out of this?
&gt; 
&gt; If I pass smog next week, I'm considering some serious exhaust system work, so
&gt; that my engine will look like Scott's.

The engine swap rules allow you to put in an engine only as old as the
chassis.  If you put in a younger engine you essentially &quot;fountain of youth&quot;
the whole car as far as smog is concerned because the chassis isn't
responsible for emissions.

With that 1979 engine, you'll be exempt at the same time an original 79
model would be: Jan 1st, 2008. Those are the rules; whether they follow them
correctly is another matter.

BTW, I recently found out that both Pertronix and Compufire have a CARB
exemption (executive order) so it's CA legal to put in any car that has
points.
