Subject: Re: [T2] Cutting out at high RPMs: '77 Bus

From jon:

 Tonight, our '77 Westy began cutting out once it was warmed up, and at
 high RPMs.

 I am quite familiar with &quot;Vanagon Syndrome&quot;, and since the FI system in a '77 is not that too different from
air (and even water) cooled Vanagons, I am applying that same logic to solving this problem.

 So, here is my proposed troubleshooting &quot;flowchart&quot; (in order of my
perceived importance):

 1) Fuel filter (of course)
2) Water in fuel
3) Points, cap and rotor, etc.
4) ECU grounds/connections
5) AFM (but, it's not always at the same RPM, so I doubt it)

 Any other suggestions?

I would spend 95% of your time on the ignition system.

Sounds like the points are bad or the spark plugs are breaking down.

Are the plugs NGK or resister plugs or platinum plugs?
I like Bosch Super W8CC.......
