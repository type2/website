Volks,
I have the Porsche sump plate on my type 4 motor and a VDO oil temp gauge on
the dash.......

Timing is on, no pinging, car runs great...........

The temperature here in SC is about 90 degrees during the day, and once my
van is warmed up, the il temp gauge when going 70 or so on the interstate is
reading about 240 F.  This sure seems high to me.  Or, is it the norm?   I
know the gauges are not 100 percent accurate........

I need help on how to lower this temp, for it seems near the thermal
breakdown point of non-synthetic oil.....also thinking about switching to
synthetic for this reason.
