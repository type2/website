To the group.  I rescued a 1979 Type 2 transporter some 14 months ago. I =
have spent allot of time in both parts and body work to bring this =
beauty back to life.  The bus is currently running very nicely and I =
personally enjoy the hell out of it except for one thing, handling. I =
understand that the bus is a brick with wheels, so I am wondering what =
other bus drivers have done about this problem, if any.  I am thinking =
about lowering it about 2 1/2&quot;, but can't find much information on it. I =
would also like to put some newer type wheels on it any wheel, but don't =
want to drill out the axles and wheel unless that is the only thing you =
can do. I want to make several trips this year but don't want to fight =
this handling problem every moment.
