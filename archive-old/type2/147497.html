Subject: Re:  acetone  and superglue use by us-a warning

quoth George Lyle:
&quot;Acetone is also called &quot;Nail Polish Remover&quot;!
Well it can't be all that bad, since women apply it directly to their 
skin all the time.
&quot;
Now you are speaking to a histologist, microscopist, and 
inventor/putterer who unwillingly had to consult a dermatologist.
.
Women should apply acetone to their nails, not their skin.  Yes, nails 
are technically skin, but much more densely crosslinked.  PS; superglue 
is good for temp. binding of a badly ripped nail. Try using acetone to 
remove grease or auto paint (it is found in lacquers and car acrylics) 
from your fingers and it will turn the skin white as it easily 
penetrates and removes skin oils AND hydration.  Years of use gave me a 
&quot;work induced psoriasis&quot; on my fingertips, where the skin was thickened 
and cracking as though it had no collagen to bind between the ridges. 
Very painful, as it would crack upon any stress like hand-tightening 
bolts or pushing on screwdrivers.  Now, two years of religious 
non-solvent contact and minimal push pull on engine work my fingertips 
are fairly normal.  You should also avoid direct contact with gasoline, 
benzene, or tolulene, as they are also carcinogenic and can cause the 
same &quot;psoriasis&quot;.

-Re dissolving cyanoacrylate- In the musical instrument support I make 
(a medical device you will find listed in Markham's text on hand 
surgury) I use a lot of superglue to hold together brass tubing and 
parts inserted into it; ie, bike spoke nipples glued into 3/16&quot;&quot; tubing. 
  Engine workers note: Superglue will soften upon being heated so the 
parts can be separated.  That's one reason I use epoxy on parts that 
will be subjected to heat, such as patching heaterbox surfaces.
