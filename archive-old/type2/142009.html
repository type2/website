Subject: timing scale and more

Hi,

I need to find a timing scale, because I've lost mine (please don't ask me
why...)! Is there a place in San Diego that might have one for sale? I thing
that the real question is Where's the neerest scrap ward? Moreover, I also need
the little plastic T that goes on the vacuum line to the distributor. Does
anyone happen to know the part number so I can order it?

once again thanks a lot

Antonio
