&gt; If you want a well-machined aluminum type 1 case, all you have to do is
&gt; get a wasserboxer case and cut the water jacket off!  

hey george    That might not be a good idea. the main bearings for 
waterboxers have gone out of site .$155.00 a set if you can find them , he could almost 
buy a new Vw case for the cost of the mains alone. Then there is all the 
machine work.    later  mark Dearing
