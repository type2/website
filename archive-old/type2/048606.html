&gt;Part number is D195A.  They are priced higher on the website, but we will
&gt;manually adjust the price if you specify in the comments section of the
&gt;order form that you're a listmember.  (Or order toll-free at
&gt;1-866-BUS-DEPOT)   Note:  If you have a very late '72 bus (after 8/72;
&gt;probably sold as a '73), you may want to make sure that you don't in fact
&gt;use '73-85 pads, which are different from these.
