&gt;&gt;How difficult would it be to remove an 
engine 1600dp from a 66 bus, strip the componets (carb, gen, exhaust) etc.  
Install the componets on a new longblock, and reinstall the engine in the 
bus?  Is this too ambitious for someone with only basic mechanical skills and 
knowledge.&lt;&lt;

  I am living proof that this can be done be a novice with limited mechanical ability and only a modest set of tools. The best thing to do is to keep a step-by-step journal of EVERYTHING you remove and to LABEL all bolts, nuts, and parts and put them in zip-lock bags layed out in the order in which they were removed. Then when you are ready for the re-install, just follow your notes backwards. It also wouldn't hurt to take a few photos of the engine before in case you need to look at it for reference when you go to put it back together. If you can get a helper who has done it before it helps greatly. I say go for it! After all, there is only one way you are going to learn it.
