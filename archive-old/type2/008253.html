To All

For the last few Spring seasons North Carolina has been the site of one of
the largest gatherings of buses on the east coast (last year it was 106.)
That event is on hiatus for 1999 so.......

It is official! The 1st annual www.Type2_dot_com campout will be held in
Harmony/Union Gorve, North Carolina at VanHoy  Farms Campground on April
16,17 and 18. The date was chosen to coincide with the IVWA B?g
Bash(show,swap, etc.) on April 18th in Farmington, NC.

Over the next week or so I will get a page on the web with all the details.

If you cannot wait that long, pmail me for details vw69bus_at_mindspring_dot_com


See you there
