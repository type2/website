Hi Tom
I am no expert on this,, but I searched the archives and the
021-101-371H is for the T4 1800cc with 41mm x 34mm valves My guess is it
is for the 1974 Carb engine
 OR could be the same head with  39.3mm x 34mm valves f.i. models had
the smaller valve sizes; some had EGR holes; some had CHT sensor
