Subject: Re: More '67 Westy minutia items sought

3.
The last item is the aluminum ring that mounts between the interior cargo
door wood paneling and the actual off-white handle on the L-shaped what not
cabinet door. (The rear most of the two cargo doors.) I have the handle and
everything else. I am only seeking the alum. trim ring for now. Sorry no
part number.

it's actually a chromed ring.  do you have the spring that goes behind the
ring too?    there should be a spring and chrome ring on each cargo door.

i have these bits, and will send them to you for a small nominal fee, if you
like.

btw, i finally found the ring that the table leg screws into for my 65, keep
on lookiing for yrs!

cant understand what yr #2 zoobie is.


Nerd Alert! 
Kind of laughing at myself here ;-)

at the last cascade kombis meeting luke lukey (i believe) was showing a
camper bit he found NOS in the box, and someone piped up &quot; NOS?  We're not
worthy!&quot;
