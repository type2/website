Subject: Re: heater AND 2nd batt in 68 camper...


Suggestions:
1. Get a bigger primary battery (you can stuff a pretty big/tall one in
there, did it with my 71, which also had a gas heater.
2. Put a sealed spare under the rear bed; if they did it with a bug you
can do it with a bus.
3. Install a Propex or similar propane heater designed for interior
inswtall.
DO NOT put a gasoline heater in the passenger compartment -Unless you
can make an isolation chamber that allows outside air to come in for
combustion and prevent any intrusion of accidental combustion products
or leaking fittings.  I saw an internal install of a BN4 behind the
passenger seat, pic available to anyone asking, very scary!
