Have you checked for gasoline in the oil?

Since both your problems began right after changing carbs, it's possible
that for whatever reason an over-rich mixture is flooding the combustion
chambers and some of the fuel is washing past the rings and into the
crankcase.

Another, more remote, possibility is that the fuel pump was somehow
disturbed during the carb change to the point that it [the pump] is now
leaking fuel into the crankcase.

Stranger things have happened.....

&gt;&gt;  Then the oil light came on at idle only. This was about 2-3 weeks after
the carb was replaced.  &lt;&lt;


&gt;  I've had the same problem for the last two months and have been pulling
my hair out trying to identify just what's going on.   I had also replaced
my carb and that's where the problems started, but I don't think they were
necessarily carb related (I could be wrong).  &lt;
