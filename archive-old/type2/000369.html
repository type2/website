I saw that '71 westy and the other bay windows for sale.  Guess I'm glad I
found a '79 with only a bit of rust and a dinged up door for only $350.00
this past September.  Interior was all there and in great shape. (Havent got
it running yet.) My only question is there is an A/C unit in the cab.  It
looks factory.  Was there a factory A/C option available for busses then or
would it just have been  a dealer approved option?

&gt;
&gt; From what I've seen in recent years baywindow buses have definitely turned
&gt; the corner on pricing and are headed back up.  This was really obvious at
&gt; OktoBugFest [Puyallup, WA fairgrounds] last weekend.
&gt;
&gt; There were several Bays for sale there, and even truly ratty and trashed
&gt; rigs were priced at least twice what they'd have been asking [and getting]
a
&gt; year or so ago.
&gt;
&gt; One '71 Westfalia that was partially &quot;restored&quot; with a so-so paint job and
a
&gt; recent engine rebuild was priced at $5,800.  The camper interior was
&gt; incomplete, the upholstery was ragged and torn, and the only clean and
shiny
&gt; part was the newish paint.  There was no shortage of interested customers,
&gt; and not a peep about the price.
&gt;
&gt; A friend chose not to put his '69 European-spec Westy for sale at Puyallup
&gt; because he thought it was too beat and tired to attract interest.  In
fact,
&gt; there were plenty of early bay buses for sale there in far worse
condition.
&gt; The cheapest I saw was a gutted and rusted out '68 or '69, with mismatched
&gt; and worn out tires and hacked holes everywhere that was priced at $2,900.
&gt;
&gt; It won't be long before parts vendors pick up on this trend, and we'll
find
&gt; ourselves in the same boat as the splitty owners.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW.....

&gt; &gt;&gt;  My feeling is the Internet is helping to push prices up. You can still
&gt; get one for a decent price, but not
&gt; from someone on the net!  &lt;&lt;
