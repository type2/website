&gt;Any suggestions for freeing an ignition lock?

Randy:

Spray liquid wrench into key slot, let it soak in for a while.
Hit key slot with rubber hammer, do it again.
Insert key.
Attach ViseGrip TM pliars to key handle.
Jiggle key around while turning.
Pull the key out, stick it back in.
Jiggle some more while turning HARDER.
Hold key still while turning HARDER.
Otta' come loose.

I actually PAID a locksmith to do this for me one time. 8 |
