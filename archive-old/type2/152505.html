Subject: Re: [T2] GWB is down - At a loss...

Hi Don,
You will not find any mechanical advise in my email because you've certainly
received many already and i'm not sure I can help.

However concerning the GWB &quot;deal braker&quot;. Please please please, do not let a
bastard tow truck steal the GWB because it was told to do so by a bastard
Home Owner Association Agent (Drone) with no goal in life other than the
goal of braking people's dream. You would be charged crazy $$$ before you
can get GWB back from wherever the bastard tow truck would abandon it and
that would be a slippery slope that leads to GWB loss.

You can easily buy yourself 3-5 days by moving the bus to the street and do
street parking. To do that, get a yellow two strap at Kragen and tow the bus
with the Volvo. Once it is on the target street, manoeuver by pushing it
into the parking spot. Then move the bus by 6 feet every 5 days.

On the longer term, you may want to store the GWB for the winter, until the
finances and the weather improves. I'm sure there are tons of places within
30 miles (1 hour volvo tow) of Denver where you could park the GWB outside
for next to free for the whole winter. Or you may want to get rid of GWB,
because it is your right to do so.

This holiday season, when asked what you want for Christmas you could ask
people to buy a share of GWB.

good luck and keep us posted

- Arnaud
