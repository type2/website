&gt;I hope someone else will correct me if I'm mistaken, but I've never
&gt;heard of a Champagne Edition Westy.
&gt;
&gt;My '78 7-passenger is one, and it's Badger Brown and Fox Red.  It came
&gt;with polished bumpers, tinted glass, carpeting, and vinyl/corduroy
&gt;seating surfaces.  75 amp alternator and auxiliary gas heater plus
&gt;booster blower through the heat exchangers.  Stainless outside mirrors. 
&gt;Padded vinyl covered dash with clock.  I *think* that's all that made it
&gt;a &quot;Champagne Edition&quot;.

There were TWO types of Champage Edition busses in 1978...the first was the
two-toned 7 passenger bus which had a &quot;brick red&quot; top and dark brown
bottom. The second was the camper which had the same dark brown bottom of
the passenger van, but the the upper part of the body is painted white.

The campers had  brown plaid seats with brown curtains. The bus had two
toned seats with courdory inserts.
