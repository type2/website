Subject: automatic vs. manual trans
Message-ID: &lt;645434C1CC34D31190A900A0C986DCF4074FC9_at_MESSAGE1&gt;

i have read that an automatic transmission actually uses more gasoline -
that when the car revs and idles and changes it's own gears it uses up
more gas than is used through manual transmission - automatics also tend
to idle richer than manual (another gas waster) I think the NA auto
industry has a deal with the gas man - make less efficient cars so we
have to buy more gas - the gas man raises the price and more money for
all - 

mandatory bus info - I am finally going to have a garage to rebuild my
engine in and am wondering if there is anyone in the detroit area who
might want to help an engine novice with her first rebuild - i have a
wonderful beer collection -
