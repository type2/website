&gt;  in there but it does.  There's no way I can stop it coming into the door
&gt;  around the window, but I would like it to exit through the drain holes at
&gt;  the bottom.  I don't see a way of doing this without covering up the hole

Hi Dave,

I park on a camber outside my house and I get this too, even on the new bus 
(but not much). When I park on the flat this area stay dry.

If you were to put a complete plastic liner on the door this would stop the 
ventalation - I dont think I ever used it much and I dought if most owners 
do. 
but I suspect the flow of air is helping to keep the inside of the door dry.  

Also my feeling would be that as the back of the hardboard panel dosn't get 
wet (well it didn't on my '73) and dosen't warp this small amount of water is 
traped by the angle you park at and seeps around the door seal. Or comes out 
of drainage holes and ponds in the drainage channel until it overflows.

To prevent water from the glass going on to the panel, tape (duct tape will 
work) a piece of  plastic sheet to the bottom of the window inside of the 
door - this stop water driping from the bottom of the door onto the panel, 
forcing it to run to the bottom of the door.

Good luck
