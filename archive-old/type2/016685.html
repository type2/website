    After reading this rather long drawn out opinion, I want to make a
comment or two...

    I have a '73 Westfalia Campmobile with a solid lifter 2.0L engine
with Weber 2-barrel carb &amp; 009 distributor as well as an automatic
tranny (w/177K original miles.  I installed the Weber when the stock
dual solexes were deemed unrebuildable (by both myself and a friend who
actually prefers them).  Aside from a bit of fabrication to relocate the
throttle cable &amp; vacuum port for tranny modulator valve it was a
straightforward installation.

    My bus starts on the coldest morning because I change the choke
setting every spring and every fall.  I have not felt any noticable
&quot;Throttle lag&quot; and I've never experienced carb icing (it does get cold
here in NH).  The Bus idles at about 1050-1100 rpm (my choice, better
response from the tranny) with nice steady beat.  While maybe a second
or so slower off the line than a manual transmissioned Bus, I've not had
any complaints about holding up traffic.  It will hold a registered 65
mph all day long on the highway without overheating, and no constant
rowing the shifter to climb those steep New England hills (we call 'em
mountains)


     I will defend the decision for this conversion to anyone until they
can prove to me that MY bus runs worse with this set-up...  (BTW my Bus
passed emissions testing for '85 model year even tho it is exempt).

        Take care...

                JonR
