&lt;&lt; If anyone is looking for a good safe home for their old vehicles,
non-running or running, I can provide a great place and genuine TLC for the
vehicle.  It is a shame to send away these buses to the scrapper as they
become less and less available!!

Thank you,

Fine...Now come up with a free way to get them to you. Most of the buses
are scrapped because the owners have no other way to dispose of them.
Even free vehicles are often difficult to get rid of...Much less &quot;store&quot;...
Quick survey: How many list members have had to scrap a bus/vehicle
because the city/neighbors complained?-(
