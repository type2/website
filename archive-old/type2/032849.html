Subject: Distributor parts

Does anyone have an old Bosch parts book or something and would be able to
tell me what parts I need to replace the bearings on my distributor.  There
is some play on the shaft but nothing else wrong so I don't want to have to
buy a new one.  It's a 2 litre pancake engine with dual carbs and the
distributor part # (as far as I can tell from looking in the type2_dot_com
library) is 0 231 168 005.
Any help etc would be appreciated.
