Greg-
	I run a storage facility and from what I know of.  We are not
responsible for anything that can happen to you or your property (your
bus).  Also, just between you and me.  As long as you don't make a huge
mess.  Most places will turn there heads when your working on your bus. 
Sepecially if your very friendly to the employees.  I work out of my own
storage unit that I turned into a shop.  Works well for me.  You can try
it see what happens.

my 2 cents.

Chuck
