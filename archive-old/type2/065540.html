Subject: Re: Engine Seal Installation Procedure?

It's easy, real easy. The shiny side faces down, the foam up. Just work
your way around, first from inside the engine compartment, then readjust
from underneath. Stretch the foam just enough to get the two ends to meet
snuggly; you don't want no gap there. If the ends meet snuggly, it doesn't
matter where the junction is.
