I have a few questions about this 'repair'. The 71 bus
used a longer 38A generator. The large tin piece that
holds it to the shroud is dished to make up for the
longer generator.

!) How did you get the pullies to line up?? [rebuilt
generators don't come with all the needed pieces]

2) The bus 38A regulator is different than the 30A bug
one.

Sounds like you have a bigger mis-match than just
missing a ground terminal.
The hub between the generator and fan are different
between the 30A and the 38A also.
