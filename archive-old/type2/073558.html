&gt; So how big of a press do I need for the

&gt; Having wrecked out about five 80-83 Vanagons and driving my own Westfalia
&gt; for seven years I can without question say that every CV joint I've
&gt; removed required persuasion to get it off the half shaft.

My experience is about 70-30.  A few joints slide right off with only
finger pressure, but most require some persuasion.  Every new joint I've
installed required persuasion.

&gt; You can beat your brains out on these things or just take them to an
&gt; Automotive Parts store that offers press services and they'll press off /
&gt; on or remove and install your new CVs for about $20.00 labor charge for
&gt; the set.

&quot;beat your brains out&quot;?  Hardly!  Just support the shaft in the middle and
use a brass hammer on the hub of the CV.  Go round and round with
light-to-moderate taps and you'll work the CV off.

Installation is the opposite of removal.  Get the thing started and use
the brass hammer to tap round and round the _hub_ of the CV and work it
back on.  When the axle starts to emerge, you can put a large socket over
it and tap through the socket with the brass hammer until you can get the
snap ring into its groove.

The reason to use a brass hammer is so the hammer will be softer than the
hardened steel of the hub.  In a pinch, you could use a steel hammer if
you hammer through a drift made of softer material.

I think that it's important to be able to do this without a press, since
you can't be sure that a press will be available if you need to change a
CV on the road.
