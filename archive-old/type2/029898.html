Subject: Whatzit Week 4 - The picture is up!

Volks,

After a week off, I decided to cut it out onthe tiny obscure parts :-)
Instead, I have dug out a large (~2 feet) obscure part!  Sooo.....  Your
task, should you decide to accept it is to identify the mystery bit at:

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/whatzit/

and prove to the list that &quot;You know too much!&quot;

This week's whatzit is the last of those I took at John Anderson's place,
so I am open to suggestions for next week (tho I do have some ideas of my
own :-)

As usual. please send your answers to this address, not the list.  I will
keep the lines open until 10:00PM EST

                           H Steven Dolan

Today's guru was yesterday's
&quot;Can I drive on two cylinders?&quot; poster.
