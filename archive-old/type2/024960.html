Subject: Clean Tools

I have been working on my bug &amp; bus fixing exhaust problems and the tools are
all covered in oily muck. Now while I know oil will protect them, since they
live inside the house I don't want the smell and more importantly, oily handles
are dangerous. Washing in water makes things rusty so how does everyone else
clean &amp; care for their tools ?
