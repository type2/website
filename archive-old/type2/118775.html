Subject: Re: [T2] Torque Wrench

&gt; I own a 1971 Westy, and I want to start doing my own maintenance on it.
 Does anyone have any recommendations on which torque wrench to buy.
 Any advice will be appreciated.

Well....that is a loaded question:)

You would actually need 3.... a 3/8&quot; ft.-lb one for small stuff like the oil screen. A 1/2&quot; ft.-lb that goes
from something like 10 to 150 for wheel nuts. And then a big one for the rear wheel nut.
For the gland nut, the 3/8&quot; one works along with a Torque Meister.

As far as brands go, I like the Snap On like this one:

but it is $250..... and I do axle nuts with it.

But I keep one of these in my bus all the time for wheel bolts:

It is only $10 right now.....
