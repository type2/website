&gt;Second question which arose as I was driving to lunch with a co-worker.  My
&gt;turn signals don't turn off after completing a turn.  I had never given it
&gt;any
&gt;thought since I have always had to turn them off since I've owned the bus. My
&gt;co-worker thought it was odd though.  Are they supposed to turn off on their
&gt;own?

Kevin,

The turn signal switch is held on by two screws.  If they loosen up, the
whole mechanism can slide downward and the tab underneath the steering
wheel will no longer touch the ring in the switch assembly which cancels
the blinkers.  You might try moving the turn signal switch assembly upwards
a bit and see if that fixes it - worked for me on my '73.
