Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy


Sorry to say it, Stan, but you would be far better off getting a $300 Fluke
78 on the SanFranAuction site for around $50. Find  the specs sheet for
your $12.95 item and see the minimum range and least count accuracy for the
ohm meter?? If you can't distinguish between 0.1 ohm and 0.5 ohms, you
cannot verify a bunch of stuff on the low amp circuits coming from and
going too the ECU. Even the grounds for the higher amp circuits you need to
know you have less than 2 ohms or your still guessing.
