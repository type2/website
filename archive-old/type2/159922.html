Subject: Rebuild just one cylinder? Cam? Bigger valves?

Hello list, my '82 2.0 liter AC Vanagon w/ megasquirt went kaput last 
fall, making horrible noises and with zero compression now in #4.  I 
suspect a valve seat let loose or even a broken valve from the noise 
made while it ran for the minute or so in this condition.  It was 
running hot on a 3000 mile trip from Calgary across the rockies to 
Vancouver down the coast to Oregon and then home across Washington and 
through Glacier park.  I kept it under 450 degrees (Dakota digital) but 
mostly it was 420 - 430 so not good I know now for sure. The trip was 
only about five hundred local miles after my own rebuild including heads 
(by reputable local shop).

Question:  Is it OK to rebuild by replacing one piston and cylinder 
only?  If so, does anyone have one or where can I buy just one?

When I rebuilt it, I put in the Webcam 107i and their lifters. I could 
never put any pre-set negative clearance on those lifters without 
obvious trouble with some valves staying open. I ran zero clearance or 
even .006 like a mech lifter, but then was not getting the benefit of 
hydraulics.  I am thinking of pulling it and going back to stock (new) 
cam and lifters.  The rebuild was totally with stock except for the cam.

Comments on this?  Better breathing with this cam should have meant 
cooler running, no?

Now I am thinking of going to big valve (42 X 36) heads with the stock 
cam.  Is this a better idea for a few more HP?  Do the Headflow Masters 
guys still do a good job, or are there others worth recommending?

Obviously before it goes back in the van there will be a thorough 
reckoning of all factors leading to the overheating problem.

Thanks,

GG
