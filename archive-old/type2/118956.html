The &quot;EA&quot; Code indicates a 914 engine for the '72 - '73 model years.
1700cc's, 8.2:1 comp., D-Jetronic.

Maybe the distributor drive gear was inserted in the engine incorrectly, so
the plug wires have been &quot;rotated&quot; to compensate?  Find TDC for #1 directly:
remove the plugs, remove the valve cover on the #1 side, and rotate the
engine until #1 piston comes up to TDC.  (If you can't peer down the spark
plug hole to see the piston moving up and down insert a thin piece of soft
wire through the spark plug hole and do it by feel.)  Check that the valves
are both closed.  Now go look at the position of the rotor; if it's pointing
at the plug wire that goes over to #1 you're set, irrespective of whether
it's pointing at the notch in the distributor body.

http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/techarticles/914_timing/914_timing.htm has a
good article on timing the engine, including how to determine where the
timing marks are at.

I'm guessing what you're feeling pulling on the pulley is endplay.

&gt; Hello all:
&gt;
&gt; I've just spent the day messing with my new acquisition, a 74 Westfalia.
The
&gt; previous did a quick job of hanging a newly-rebuilt 914 engine in it just
&gt; before I bought it.  I am now trying to get it timed properly and I'm
finding
&gt; it rather frustrating!  When I line up the rotor with the notch on the rim
of
&gt; the distributor is it not supposed to be lined up to fire on cylinder #1?
&gt; Unless I'm interpreting things incorrectly it's lined up to fire on ##4
&gt; because at the notch the rotor is pointing to the lead for cylinder #4.
I've
&gt; removed the rubber plug on the fan shroud and I can from this point find
what
&gt; may be a TDC mark but I really don't know for sure.  It's more of a
&gt; lighter-colored spot on the fan that a 'mark' and it is certainly not a
&gt; 'notch.'  When I got the notch on the distributor lined up and the
&gt; light-colored spot on the fan showing and tried to set the valves for
cylinder
&gt; 1 one was open and one was closed so clearly I wasn't at TDC.  There does
seem
&gt; to be a notch on the pulley where all the timing marks are but when it's
lined
&gt; up with 0 there is no corresponding mark under the rubber plug.  I don't
know
&gt; if it makes a difference but the engine # is EAS600703.  I can't figure
out
&gt; what it is exactly.  I was told that it was from a 914 and there was an EA
&gt; series 1.7L 914 engine.  If this is true than I should be timing to 27.5
&gt; degrees BTDC but again I'm not sure.
&gt;
&gt; In all the fooling around I also discovered that if I pull straight out on
the
&gt; pulley I can rock it in and out a little bit. What does this mean?
Anything
&gt; is possible with this engine as some of the work seems to have been done
well
&gt; and some of it has been done very poorly.
