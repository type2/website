Subject: Re: Not for Purists

Have been there and done that. First bus was a 61 panel that i put ford
thunderbolt tear drop hood scoops on. Mounted them sideways with
teardrop in front,scoop opening in rear right over stock loovers. Second
bus was a 67 panel that i mounted 67 corvete 427 hood scoops on. they
looked better then thunderbolts. Both buses were in early Hot VW
quarterlys. Drove both buses in so. cal for years with no overheat
problems. Also mounted 356 engine lid loovers on rear deck lid where
lin. plate went on both. My best ?????? work of art was the 61 crewcab
that i chopped the top on. I chopped it 4 inches. Was painted gloss
black with magenta (hot pink) scallopes. You havent done nuttin till you
have chopped safaris windows and windwings on an early bus, took as long
as cutting roof. Molded vw bug hood emblem in the rear for taillights.
Looked cool at night. Hamile didnt talk to me for a while after that
one. He hasnot seen my latest yet. This should send the purists to the
medicine cabinet. I also do restore them stock. The sazsall wont get
close to my Binz crewcab. Hope to SEE SOME OF YOU IN HAVASU!!!!
