&gt; Peter,
&gt; Is your rig fuel injected?

Hey Oly, Nope, it's carburated.


&gt; The fuel line for carbureted usually goes over the tranny (with clips to
&gt; hold the hose to the top of the tranny tunnel) and through the firewall on
&gt; the driver's side of the engine.

Ah, I didn't see any clips. Will have to take a closer look. I have a fuel 
filter with two outlets and can T-off right under the tank and route the line 
as you've described....


&gt; In my experience the T for the fuel lines has been just in front of the
&gt; firewall when I get the vehicle with both lines going through the firewall.
&gt; There may be a functional reason that was done but on my installs I place
&gt; the T in the engine compartment, usually under the heater.

So then it doesn't really make any difference either way? OK. Thanks for the 
info.
