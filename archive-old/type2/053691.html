Subject: Sikkens Autocryl Rally Black

Has anyone ever tried this stuff (Sikkens describes it as &quot;a low gloss black
topcoat for use whenever a black eggshell finish is required&quot;) on engine
tin? It sounds like great stuff for cab floors and metal dashboard pieces,
but those aren't going to eat up a whole quart.
