Subject: Re: [T2] Syn oil to regular oil- Dangerous?


       I was recently told by my mechanic that regular 30W was the preferred 
oil for the type 4 engines. Of course we are talking about the vanagons but, 
he told me the synthetic just didn't do the job that was meant by regular 
oil. He said synthetic was &quot;too clean.&quot;
     Of course I use synthetic in mine and the whole oil debate is like a 
presidential smear campaign but, I don't truly know enough about it. I've 
always heard that synthetic oils are usually best for older engines while 
the standard is best for newer/rebuilt ones.
   I've almost always had older (100+k) vehicles so I've always used 
synthetic motor oil. Whether it helps or not I have no idea. My bus still 
uses about half a quart (sometimes) between gas tanks. But, this is also 
cause I haven't had the time, nor cash cause I've been fixing other things 
all summer, to rebuild heads, valves, and replace pushrod tubes and seals.
    So, in all this, I think you'll hear all kinds of advice. I usually try 
to listen to someone who sounds very smart worthy and keep that one to make 
my own decision. Take all the knowledge you can get and then make a choice.

  Good luck!

Joel,

Yes, it's expensive, but I believe it is worth it.

I don't change oil every 3,000 if I use synthetic....that is sure to get a
few flames&lt;grin&gt;.

Some of my cars use syn and some I use the reular stuff.

In my opinion....the synthetic lasts longer than dino.

I have some water cooled vehicles that I use only synthetic...go 10,000
miles between changes.  I *never* use any oil between changes in them and
I drive them hard.  The last one I treated that way had 127,000 on it and
still used *no* oil between changes...

As always....Your mileage may vary.  :-)

Cheers ,dave

 &gt; Volks,
 &gt; 	I'm looking at a vanagon that all it's life has had a diet of Mobil 1
 &gt; Synthetic oil. Being on the  verge of owning this van, and seeing how
 &gt; EXPENSIVE synthetic motor oils are, I'm wondering if it really is 
necessary
 &gt; to continue using the synthetic stuff. The van already has 130K on it and
 &gt; I'm looking for another 75K or so from it (without a rebuild (yes, it is
 &gt; totally possible)). Does anyone out there have any experience with 
switching?
 &gt; I guess I've just never been convinced of the advantages of the synthetic
 &gt; stuff; at least not convinced enough to go from about a buck a quart to
 &gt; almost 4 bucks a quart.
 &gt; My &quot;head smarts&quot; are telling me to just bite the bullet and keep going 
with
 &gt; the synthetic, but my wife (and our one income and two children) are 
making
 &gt; me look into the possibility of doing it cheaper.
 &gt; I always get ADVICE when I post to the lists, but what I really want is
 &gt; actual, real world, experiences. Of course, all responses, experience or
 &gt; otherwise, will be greatly appreciated.
 &gt; Thanks,
 &gt; Joel
