Subject: Re: [T2] Turn Signal Switch 72 Bus

Hello, John and list,

A couple of month's back I parted out a 72 westy. I
have the turn signal switch part # 211 953 531b. I am
not sure if it works properly. I wasn't able to test
it properly, the wiring on the bus was hacked up
pretty bad. When I did try testing it the dash light
would come on but the turnsignals wouldn't work, again
because the wiring was pretty bad. The switch to me
looks like it would work, all the wires are in good
shape, and none of them have been cut.

Is there a way I can test it without a 72 bus around?
I have a 78 and 79 bus. 

Or John if you are interested in trying it let me
know, I would be willing to send it to you for the
cost of shipping. Then if it does work for you, you
could maybe make a donation to the list for what you
think is fair. Or if it doesn't work all your out is a
few bucks for shipping. Let me know.

Thanks,
Shawn Reed

&gt; List-
&gt; The turn signal switch on my 72 bus has failed.  Bus
&gt; Depot tells me  
&gt; that the switch is backordered and has been for a
&gt; long time.  The 72  
&gt; bus has a switch that is 72 only.
&gt; I took the switch apart to glue the broken part but
&gt; don't think I can  
&gt; get it back together.  Will another year switch
&gt; work? Does anyone  
&gt; have a solution to this problem?
