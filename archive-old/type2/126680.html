Subject: Bus died while driving and now doesn't start(Help me!!!!)

I recently installed my newly rebuilt 2 liter FI engine in my ' 78 bus. Heres 
the story: 
       I had no problems with the engine for the first 2 weeks and everything 
was great until   I changed the oil after the first 250 miles. I made sure I 
didn't go over 45mph until I hit 250 miles.   Yes, the correct amount of oil 
was in then, and the dipstick currently measures full.  After the oil was 
changed I went to work and then after work I went on the highway and drove for 
about 15 miles at around 73mph with no problems and then I turned around and came 
back with absolutely no problems. The next morning I was driving again on the 
highway at about 75mph and everything was going great until I started to slow 
down to make a turn, my engine &quot;popped&quot; (it sounded like a backfire) and there 
was no response from the transmission.  I was in 4th at the time and the 
engine just revved after the pop as I still had my foot on the pedal.  At first I 
thought I just slipped out of gear until I downshifted to third and the engine 
would just rev.  I pulled to the side of the road and turned the engine off.  
 I waited about 5 min and then tried to start it but no luck. Now my bus is 
just in the garage.  It turns over fine, but it won't start.  Please help me 
diagnose what is wrong.

Thanks,

Mark
