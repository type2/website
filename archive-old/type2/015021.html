&gt;&gt; That's good advice, but it's not that simple to adjust.  You have to
&gt;&gt; purchase a special washer that you peen in place after you have the
&gt;&gt; adjustment right.  DO NOT REUSE THE OLD WASHER.  
&gt;
&gt;This is true and not true... once again the variation thru the years will
&gt;catch you if you are not careful.  
My answer was to the specific problem - on an '80 Vanagon.  I have an '82,
and I tried to reuse a washer.  (&quot;Why not?&quot; I thought.)  Because the nut
comes loose and you lose a a wheel or at least a bearing, that's why not.
