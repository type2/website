Right on!  Hopefully other places pick up on this.  I think smog testing is 
ineffective if you can plan on getting tested.  Here in BC everyone has to get 
checked every year.  But you always see cars on the road (not just old vehicles 
like ours but a fair share of 90's cars too) spewing smoke like they got a guy 
in the back seat shoveling coal into a furnace.

I think all cities should have remote testing equipment and a group to drive 
around and pull over cars that are smoking.  If they fail the roadside test then 
their car should be towed to the inspection station.
