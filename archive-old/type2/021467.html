When you say the timing is dead on, does that mean that your vacuum
advance is working correctly?

&gt; I have a 1979 Westy with a FI 2.0 liter and automatic tranny. The motor
&gt; idles and runs great. When I accelerate slowly the motor feels like its
&gt; holding back. Almost like I'm driving with my foot on the brake. No misfires
&gt; or stalling. It feels like the engine is slightly hesitating and slightly
&gt; surging. If I drive with a heavy foot it doesn't happen...only when I'm
&gt; accelerating slowly. The timing is dead on and everything else seems to be
&gt; in order. Any and all suggestions on this would be greatly appreciated!
