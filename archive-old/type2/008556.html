Jim and Others,

Geez, I hate to see these threads where everyone claims 
to have the answer. I hate even more to weigh in on them myself, but...

&gt; &quot;Conventional Wisdom&quot; strikes again..(SNIP)..The 009 is an acceptable
&gt; distributor in your dragster 2180 bug.  It is not an acceptable
distributor in
&gt; a 1600 bus.

I disagree. I have a '69 Westy 1600sp, 30/31 and .009 and it works
fine. Yes, there is a SLIGHT hesitation of the start which is cured by
SLIGHT slipping of the clutch.

This bus was purchased with this set-up (though I did have to replace
the .009 when it wore out), so I don't know how it would perform with
a vacuum advance. HOWEVER, my previous '69 station wagon had vacuum
advance and other than the slight hesitation in the .009, performed
the same. Yes, it got better mileage, but I attribute that more to the
fact the Westy is less aerodynamic and several hundred pounds heavier.

If I could get a vacuum advance for the same price as a .009, I'd
probably try it. But not 'til this one wore out.

As far as I'm concerned, this is a FART
(Frequently-Annoyingly-Recurring-Thread). There are ardent supporters
in both the pro-.009 and anti-.009 camps. Personally, I'm neither. It
was a matter of cash-flow in my case.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I recently purchased a 67 bus with a &quot;new&quot; 1600 DP engine.
Although it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;seemed to run pretty well when warm, it was barely driveable
when cold due
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to a horrendous hesitation (or stumble) at low RPM in each
gear.  I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;told that the carb (a PICT-34 I think) was new.  It also has a
new 009
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;distributor.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This dizzy/carb combo is legendary for this. Best is to lose the
009 and get
&gt; &gt; &gt; a real dizzy. One with a vacuum advance. Alternately you can
adjust the carb
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the point that you will get lousy fuel economy and it will
run nearly
&gt; &gt; &gt; okay.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I disagree. Stick with the 009 its a superior distributor. You
don't want to
&gt; &gt; have to rely on a vacum advance distributor.
&gt; &gt; They're ancient. When using an 009 with a 34.3 there will be a
dead stop upon
&gt; &gt; shift up through the gears.
&gt; &gt; Learn how to drive it best to eliminate that - overlap the clutch
with the
&gt; &gt; gas pedal a bit more and it will go smoother.
&gt; &gt; By the way, the 34.3 is a mediocre carb on its best day fresh out
of the box,
&gt; &gt; so you might consider switching to a 30pict1
&gt; &gt; and an adaptor plate, this will also help your dead spot.
