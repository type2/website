Subject: RE: [T2] scary noise

Ryan,

Since the noise got worse under load, that is indicative of a wrist-pin or a
dropped valve seat. Glad you stopped when you did.

Does it make the same cacophony when idling? If so,

Do a compression test for basic engine health and then a leak-down test
first to see if it is your valves. If your numbers are good and the noise
continues at idle, you should pull your motor and start thinking longblock
rebuild.

CV joints don't usually start tapping and suddenly get worse unless you were
messing with them earlier and there is a chance the bolts came loose. CV's
tend fail slowly over time and a first indication of failure is a tapping
around corners.

BTW, my 78 Westy was doing the same thing. Bad rings, dropped valve seats
and a bad wrist pin. Ugh.
