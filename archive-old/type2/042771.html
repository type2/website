You might want to take a small piece of sand paper and sand the connections.
When we got Jude back on the road recently all we had was one working tail
light and headlights I think... no back ups, signals, etc. After we fixed a
couple of shorts poorly fixed by the PO, we used a wiring diagram to hunt
down and then sand almost all of the connections to make the rest of the
lights work. Cruddy.
