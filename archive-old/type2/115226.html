Subject: Re: [T2] Combi? and introductions

Welcome to the neighbourhood! I grew up in Bountiful, UT, and am also an
internet Reverend. (Start secret handshake now)

&quot;Combi&quot; or &quot;Kombi&quot; means that it is a hardtop van with two bucket seats
forward, and a three seat bench in the very back, leaving a large cargo
space in the middle. (People and Cargo=Kombi). Handy, but it is almost
impossible to talk to your passengers as they are soooo far back.

I just got into type 2s earlier this year, when someone gave me an old
red-black-blue-yellow-with-daisies-on-the-hubcaps Kombi, though now I also
have a Westy (just white). Beware: These things are addictive! Make sure you
have a big driveway, and an understanding wife and neighbours.

Getting to know my busses has been a steep, but not too painful learning
curve for me. Three resources that have proven indispensable: The Bentley
manual, Muir's &quot;How to keep your VW alive&quot;, and type2_dot_com. This list is
populated with a variety of amazingly knowledgeable (if sometimes grumpy)
Volkswagen gurus. Also the archives and library also hold a ton of useful
info, and are a good place to start. They are great vehicles, and you are in
for alot of fun!

Cheers,
Matthew
