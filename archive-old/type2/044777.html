Subject: [T2] Magnetic front window screens website

You can view the front magnetic window screens I am making at:

http://pages.cthome_dot_net/rocknoats/busscreens/

I spelled the site wrong in a previous post, but this is the correct one and 
works fine.  E-mail me directly if you are interested in a pair.

Thanks,
