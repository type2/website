Subject: RE: [T2] 71 heat control levers

Paul,

That is exactly what we are here for. BUStedBUS is your ultimate salvage
yard. We have many heater and vent control levers and the wonderful little
plastic pieces that hold them in. FYI the plastic pieces can be removed by
finding the right size socket that squishes the tapered end and pushes them
out. Please check out our web site under Heater then heater control unit to
find these parts. Thanks.

Subject: [T2] 71 heat control levers


Hi Folks,
  I've been laying on the front floor of our '71 wondering how to fix the
broken heat control levers in my dash.  The only parts yard around here with
buses doesn't have any for an early bay.  The metal levers are broken off
just above the dash and of course there are no knobs on them.   So I'm
wondering;
    1.  does anyone have a pair of these levers to sell me?
    2.  what do I use in place of the plastic rivet that holds the 2 pieces
of the lever together?  The dealer says the OEM part is no longer available
and I dont see anything in the usual catalogs.
