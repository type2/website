&gt; But if you insist on converting an aircooled VW into a watercooled one, how
&gt; about scrounging yourself a dual-belt fan pulley off a smog-pumped Bus,
&gt; buying a water pump for an American car (a FLAPS advertising circular lists
&gt; them as &quot;starting at $16.98&quot;) and using that to run the water system?

&gt; This unfortunately defeats the purpose of the extra cooling by adding extra
&gt; load to the engine, which =  added BTU.  An electric pump is the only way I
&gt; can think of to bypass this problem.  If you were to use a full-sized
&gt; mechanical pump, Moroso makes an electrically driven one for drag-racing
&gt; V-8's.

To quote R.A Heinlein, TANSTAAFL. There ain't no such thing as a free
lunch. 

Running an electric pump is going to take a bit more hp than a
mechanical pump.  Why? Those electrons have to come from somewhere.  

In a drag racing application, the electrical system is &quot;total loss&quot;.
Meaning that there's no generating capacity at all.  AQfter all, the
motor only has to run for ten seconds.  (Actually, maybe ten minutes
when you include getting from the pits to the line and staging.) For a
street application a total loss system just isn't practical. So, you run
an alternator/generator.  That takes hp.  

If said dynamo is having to produce more power to run the proposed water
pump, it's got to get that power from somewhere.  Care to guess where
it's coming from?

Why more power than a mechanical pump?  Charging systems are not 100%
efficient.  A well designed system theoretically can be 90% efficient,
but never 100%. Neither are electric motors 100% efficient. As you
convert from mechanical power to electricity to mechanical power, those
losses add up. End result?  It takes more crankshaft hp to run the
electric pump than to run a mechanical pump.  Were it otherwise, Detroit
iron would use the system.  Less hp requirements = greater mpg.
