Subject: sportmobile info?

Hello Listees,

I have been busless for about 4 months. But I did something about it.

I bought a 70 sportmobile. Boy does it feel good to be back behind the wheel

of a bus. Does anybody out there have any info or lit. about sportmobiles?

Any help would be great.

Thanks,

Dave Parsons
