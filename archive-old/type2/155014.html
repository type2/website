Subject: Re: (Simple) Solenoid Question

David C Matthews asked...&quot; *where* is the starting solenoid on a '71
Camper?&quot;

David, the solenoid is part of the starter assembly.  You can access them by
laying on the ground under the right hand side of the bus.  It's actually
mounted on the front side of the bellhousing, toward the top, on the right
hand side.  You'll be able to access the terminals, to jump them, with
little or no problem, just be careful!
