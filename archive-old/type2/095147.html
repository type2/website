Subject: Engine Removal Question

Ok, for those of you with remotely mounted oil coolers and/or oil =
filters, do you remove these too (still hooked up to the engine) when =
you pull the engine or do you disconnect the hoses?  I'm curious how =
other people handle this?  It seems like removing everything in a =
still-hooked-up condition might be a little more work but would be much =
cleaner than trying to disconnect the hoses and having oil everywhere.

Any advice? I can take some pictures if you want.
