Subject: Sliding rear windows

Hi volks,
	    I have a louvred window (not the westy one but the type
fitted to Devon conversions in the UK) which is draughty. I am
thinking of replacing it with a sliding window, which I hope would
seal better but am concerned that I might lose one of the 
advantages of the louvred style- that is, it can be left open (to
let air circulate around my dog!) without seriously compromising
security.
 Is there any way to latch the sliding ones partly open? 
Alternatively, does anyone know of a way to get these to seal 
better?

Cheers,
	 W.
