&gt; On the left side of the fan housing on my 78 westy, there seems to be a

&gt; I just noticed it yesterday. It is on the left vertical wall of the
&gt; housing, facing the extra battery. Any ideas what its for?

That connection goes to the charcoal cannister.  Air from the fan
pushes fuel vapors out of the char-can into the air filter box.
It's part of the emissions equipment.  On my CA '78 engine, it is
on the right side of the fan housing.  I've seen a 48-state '76 bus
that had it on the left side.

&gt; I am just wondering if it as anything to do with the bus not starting
&gt; for more than 3-5 seconds... But thats another story for later on...

Probably not related to the fan housing fitting.
Check for vacuum leaks.  A vacuum leak on FI busses will kill the idle.
