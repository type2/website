&gt;Thanks, thats a good piece of information.  For what
&gt;its worth, they say that yellows and reds are more
&gt;expensive then other colors.

I asked Senik Paint Co in Costa Mesa, CA to fill a
rattle spray can with L20B Brilliant Orange for my
bus.

They said they would not.  The yellow and red paints
contain lead, and the State of California would not
allow them to sell it to me.
