Subject: Little girl from Wyoming
Content-Description: cc:Mail note part

A short time ago someone posted a message about a little girl from Wyoming who
was lost. They listed a web site. Today I saw that she was found dead. I can not
think of a horrible enough punishment for who ever did it. I can't think of
anything else to say. Go and give your kids a hug and a kiss.

The web site is:
