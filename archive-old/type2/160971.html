Right. I just meant that plugging one side wouldn't affect the other.

&gt; Plus, they would both have to be sealed from both the atmosphere  
&gt; and from each other, meaning that plugging one of the holes would

&gt; turn affect the other side's operation.

Look at the retard nipple. It's not sealed against the body.
