Subject: Nordstrom Shoes, Car Crushers, Classic Cars and Man-Haters

Happy Friday Volks,

I have been saving this as a Friday note.  It's not directly related to VW's, 
at least not yet, but we could be next.

A couple of weeks ago I saw the new Nordstrom's TV ad for their new shoe 
website.  For those of you who haven't seen it, it shows a wife having her 
husband's absolutely cherry 1958 Cadillac convertible being towed away.  Then 
you see it being very slowly crushed in a car crusher.  Finally you see the 
husband opening the garage door to find his beloved classic gone.  The tag 
line is - women do whatever it takes to make room for more shoes.

I started to write Nordstrom's but let it drop.  Then a few days later I saw 
another ad that showed a half empty closet.  Then you see the husband coming 
home to see all his clothes piled out on the street.  Once again the point 
was - women do whatever it takes to make more room for more shoes.

At that point I wrote Nordstrom's using their comment box on the Nordstrom 
shoes website.  The letter I wrote was long, but I made two main points.  
Regardless of the intent of their commercial, there can be absolutely no 
excuse for crushing an irreplaceable classic automobile.  (The shot was too 
much of a close-up.  It was not a fake.)  The second point was that the 
commercials were very obviously targeted to women who hate men and the things 
that most men love.  It was a commercial probably by, and obviously aimed at, 
man-haters.  After a few days I received the following reply:

Dear Mr. Hunt, 

Thank you for your letter regarding our new Make Room for Shoes ad campaign 
that is helping launch NORDSTROMshoes_dot_com, the world's biggest shoe store.  
We sincerely regret that the ad you mentioned
did not come across to you in the humorous and lighthearted way it was 
intended. The campaign was designed for comic effect rather than literal 
interpretation -- The extreme example is just used to demonstrate the 
irrational passion of shoe lovers in an attention-getting manner.  

We do know many of our customers love shoes, and the campaign provides some 
outrageous, but fictitious examples of what women might do to make room for 
more of them.  We greatly appreciate your feedback and
will give careful consideration to your thoughts as we move ahead with 
Nordstrom_dot_com and its marketing efforts.

Sincerely, 

Deborah 
Customer Service Specialist

You'll note that they do not deny that a geniune 1958 Caddy convertible was 
really crushed.  As a matter of fact, they think it was all a joke.  They 
also don't respond to the comment that this ad appeals to women who hate men. 
 Let this be a warning.  Today a classic Caddy - tomorrow a classic VW.  And 
if you're in firing range of a man-hater, better protect your VW.  

I don't believe in spamming, but....if you happen to actually see the 
commercial itself, write Nordstrom's and let them know how you feel about it.

David Hunt
