This is probably one of the most frustrating jobs
I've done to date.  Also the technique probably is'nt the best but it
worked.
Find a long socket about the size of the hole but big enough to push the
bushings out the top of the assembly.  Place the socket over the bushing
and tap till it begins to move.  There's not alot of room underneath to
hammer easily so be patient.  You can use more force as the bushing
moves up through he hole.  When you reach the limit of the first socket,
grab another one and hold with a vise grip as you continue pounding
away.  The job will get more difficult when you reach the second
bushing.  Keep pouding till the bushings release themselves through the
top of the hole.
The more critical part of the job is putting the new bushings in.  Press
them in slowly and SQUARELY with a c clamp and the above mentioned
sockets.  Be patient, do not use a hammer or any other kind of pounding
force to do this.  I ruined a set of bushings doing it that way.
When bushings are in place, insert pin if you can.  I had trouble doing
this. The pin was difficult to insert and bound up.  They mention using
a reamer to allow clearance but I found a brake cylinder hone did the
trick.  Don't get crazy with the hone.  Do a little at a time until pin
slides in with minor resistance and no play.
After assembly, inject grease ASAP.
Like I said,  maybe not the best method but she's solid after 6000
miles.
Good luck!!!!!
