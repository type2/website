Subject: Re: [T2] Sunday reading

&gt;Now it can be told...According to CR, a brand new bus
&gt;rides just like mine...Watta relief, I thought mine was
&gt;just old and worn out... ;-)

Haha, that was exactly what I was thinking. Really enjoyed reading it 
epecially when they said they had trouble doing the 0-60 test as they didn't 
have enough track.

But hey, how many 71 Chevy Suburbans do you see on the road these days?

71 Westy &quot;Keki Puko&quot;
