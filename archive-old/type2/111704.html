&gt;   On that note, does anyone have a favorite place to test vacuum?  My
&gt; initial thought was to disconnect the hose from the donut on the
&gt; distributor and test there.  Should I only test vac at idle?  I guess
&gt; revving with the vac advance disconnected probably won't work so well.

The proper place to check vacuum on a fuel injected engine is the vacuum
port on the air distribution box between the runners for cylinders 1&amp;2.
When you buy the gauge you should also buy a T-fitting, a short length of
vacuum hose appropriate to the port on the air distribution box and a
vacuum cap.  Install the short length of hose between one side of the
crossbar of the T and the port on the air distribution box, then attach
the old vacuum line to other end of the crossbar of the T.  Attach the
vacuum gauge to the vertical and you are ready to check vacuum.  When you
are finished, remove the gauge and cover the vertical with the vacuum cap.

Vacuum should be checked initially with all hoses connected.  If it is low
then you may discover the leak by disconnecting and capping each accessory
in turn.  A selection of vacuum caps and rubber stoppers is useful for
this.

While it is possible to check vacuum at higher RPMs, it is not terrible
useful. Vacuum will drop as the engine accelerates and will rise as it
returns to idle but the reading you are interested in is manifold vacuum
at idle.  It should be a steady 15 to 18 inches of mercury and higher is
much better.

                             OOK!
