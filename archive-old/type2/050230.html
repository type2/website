Subject: [T2] head rebuild question

hey volks,
ive got a question regaurding rebuilt heads.  my bus
currently has 2 rebuilt AVP heads that i have
definitely been happy with.  however it seems last
fall when i had a couple head bolts come loose and
cooked my #1 piston it also severly shortened the life
of my passenger side head.  the bus is running well
but low compression on #1 now.  my question is this,
has anyone had good luck having a local machine shop
rebuild their head as opposed to going through someone
VW specific like AVP.  i will probably get an AVP
head, but im a bit poor right now and thought local
might be a little cheaper, but im concerned about
longevity.  of course if anyone has an 1800 head in
great shape they would like to part with that would be
great too.  any advice appreciated.  im jonesin to
take a west coast trip this spring and need to get her
ready!
TIA
