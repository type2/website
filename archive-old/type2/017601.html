In my experience, HF has been great about returns, even paying shipping;
so it's low risk to buy from the catalogs.  Not long ago, I ordered the
tire changer, used it removing tires from rims until it broke enough to
be useless (50 or so acVW wheels -- don't ask -- and then returned it
(w/free shipping).

He's also right about waiting for the sales.  An alternative to waiting
is to save all the zillions of catalogs they send you; then, when you
want something, go back through them to find the lowest price -- they
seem to honor old catalogs almost indefinitely, unlike JC Whitney.  Just
yesterday, I went through about a years worth of catalogs, selecting
items for the &quot;come on&quot; items advertised for half price (or thereabouts)
off the covers and just inside on the first and last few pages.  Oh, and
don't forget to check the website, which sometimes has a still lower
price (as for the HVLP paint gun for 39.99 -- haven't used it yet).
BTW, the price is determined by the last four characters (one number and
three letters) of the number after the hyphen -- you need that to get
the price you want, though I think they are legally required to give you
the lowest price if you ask for it.

Todd, here's a question for you:  If I have a trans (68-70) that pops
out of 4th, and I want to squeeze the most life out of it before it
gives out, can I just keep it pulled back and in gear with a bungee
cord, or will this accelerate its eventual demise?
