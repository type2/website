Subject: Re: Help! '76 FI problems

Check the 3 FI wires going to the coil.
Coming down from the heater fan is a 3 wire harness wrapped in black. In it
will be a black wire, a white wire, and a blue/black. The black and the
white will be the same length, the blue/black will about 4&quot; longer. There is
also a single white wire coming across the engine from the passenger side.
Make SURE these wires are correctly connected or you will not trigger the FI
ECU:

Blue/black:  oil pressure sending unit
Black: POSITIVE [15] side of coil
Both whites: NEGATIVE side [1] of coil

The + [15] side should have 3 wires: red (key-on power), black to fuse
holder for backup lights, and black for FI.

The - [1] side should have 3 wires: green to dist, and 2 whites.
