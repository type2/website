Subject: Re: [T2] First Ride

	Mike, George, Bob, List, et al...

	Boy, did this thread take some interesting turns...

	I did notice that nobody, so far, has suggested that Mike take a
look at the actuating lever and clevis up at the front (FIF) in the clutch
pedal mechanism.  These babies wear out too - and when you buy your spare
cable, be sure to verify it's length with whatever is at your disposal -
it's a side-splitting Bucket o' Hilarity (guaranteed to leave you laughing
'til you stop) to be sitting there by the side of the road with a cable
that's too short...  Not that this has ever happened to me or anything ;-)

	Buy the clevis and a wing nut, in fact, buy a couple extras and keep
them with the verified length spare.  I've had circumstances where the
broken end of the clutch cable took the wing nut with it when they went to
Clutch Cable Heaven (tm)...  Check your bowden tube and it's deflection spec
while you're under there, and a clever owner will also take a peek at the
pressed metal bowden tube holder thingie, too!  Funny the way those things
will crack when nobody is watching :-0

	Bus Boys repops the actuating levers, although they are essentially
flat stock and NOT with the nice little off-set to them like the OE piece.
I had one on my '72 Weekender - it lasted a couple years, but it will wear
as will the clevis...  time to weld 'em up and redrill 'em...  If it's
feasible - goober the clevis and lever with some grease, too - I like Swepco
- it'll help hold off the Wear 'n Tear Monster.  A clever owner will also
figure a way to wrap the clevis/lever interface with a grease-holding
diaper...

	My 2 cents...
