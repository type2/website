Subject: Re: [T2] not sparking everytime

&gt;
&gt;DWELL DWELL DWELL. ok I'll say it again DWELL!
&gt;
&gt;I think this may be the dwell.  Set at 50 and she just
&gt;purrs.



Last night I changed out condensor, points, rotor, and dizzy cap. The Dwell 
is dead on 50...ok maybe like 50.25 but pretty damn close. Still not 
sparking on #4 consistantly and #1 juus most of the time. I think I'll try 
new wires.
