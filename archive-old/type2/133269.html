&gt; Ok, Ill try and get a deck to tow it on. It's an automatic so im guessing it
&gt; can't be pulled without damaging the tranny. It has to go about 90 kms
&gt; to get home.

right you cannot tow an auto tranny very far without overheating the
tranny and damaging it,.   put it on something or remove the half shafts.

&gt; Almost tempted to drive it 10 minutes, cool it. Drive it cool it. And see if

I would not try that without guages to monitor the temps, the engine can
overheat in a lot less than 10 minutes and need more than an hour to cool
down

good luck
Bob
