Subject: Re: [T2] cv joint replacement 

Well Steve, if you ever want to do the job i made a complete step by
step web page last year on the subject.
This was done with/for my 87GL but they are all the same!!! (Almost)

About 40$ USD including new screws, grease and boot.
If one velocity joint is worn, you will see it right away (about 50$
each including boot, grease &amp; bolt)

http://pages.infinit_dot_net/engine/cv_joint_maintenance.htm

It's a 3-4 hours job per side, very easy but messy.

Have fun, Ben
