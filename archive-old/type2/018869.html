Subject: '77 starts and dies, spinning noise heard b4 stall
Message-ID: &lt;37F828A4.38022A6C_at_redshift_dot_com&gt;

Hey all, first the stats, '77 type 2, 2.0 L fuel injected, stock,
automatic, 22k on AVP rebuild, recent plugs, points, use premium gas...

My bus has developed what I think may be a more serious than not
problem.  It was running great, I mean great, then in the course of no
more than a half hour it stopped running.  I felt an initial couple of
small hesitations, but was driving into a strong onshore wind near the
ocean, so figured it was that and not the engine.  I turned the radio
off, and listened and the next time I was sure it was the engine and not
a blast of wind.  I pulled off the highway at the next exit and went to
a gas station where it stalled out as I pulled in.  I decided to have it
towed by AAA back to near my home, and got a rental.  It seemed similar
in nature to a recent problem I had with low idle/stall that was
corrected by a valve adjustment.  I first of all checked the valves, and
found that 1, 3 and 4 had tightened and 2 had loosened, not by great
extents but enough that they needed adjustment.  I got in started it up
and it purred, sounded perfect to the ear, but then it stalled.  I had a
friend start it back up and I was going to check point dwell when I
heard it make a spinning noise right before it stalled.  I would say it
came from the area in front of the flywheel, near the distributor.  My
first thought is that perhaps my distributor shaft is worn and that some
sort of mechanism with &quot;teeth&quot; is not holding so it gets no spark... I
repeated starting it three times, and it did the same thing in about the
same amount of time (15 seconds or so) each time.  Giving it more gas or
anything else did not change the effect other than perhaps to bring the
onset of stalling aboout quicker.  Any ideas?? The sound was not
horrific, like grinding metals, but more on the lines of a spinning
sound, not unlike what a small electric motor would sound like.  thanks,
Scoob
