&gt; 
&gt; OK, Sean, you definitley have a point. A good point. A real good point. =
&gt; Here is more ASTM stuff - The RON affects low to medium speed knock and =
&gt; engine run-on or dieseling.  The MON affects high speed and part =
&gt; throttle knock, during periods of power acceleration or hill-climbing. =
&gt; After this it says- The performance of a fuel, in some vehicles, may be =
&gt; best represented by the RON. and in others the MON. Extensive studies =
&gt; indicate that, on balance, gasoline AKI  performance is best related to =
&gt; the average of the two. There, now tell me more about the CLC method, =
&gt; please. I want to learn as much as I can. Thank you. Jim Duncan OUT
&gt; 
Jim,
Thanks for the info on the different numbers.  

The CLC thing is US Cost of Living Council (according to the VW owner's
manuals I have), which is also the same thing as the average of the RON
and MON.  

So one is equal to the other.
