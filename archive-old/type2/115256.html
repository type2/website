 Learning more everyday!!!

 What's your opinion of using a buffing wheel on steel wool? Would that it
 closer to a mirror finish without harm?

Hey there-

I assume you meant using a buffing wheel on Stainless steel. This works well
in my experience. Actually, on small stuff, like a stove top, my favorite is
using a Dremel with a buffing wheel and the &quot;Brite!&quot; polish I mentioned.
Nice and shiny, and easy to get into all of the little nooks.

This may be a bit exessive when it comes to buffing wheels, but good
stainless shops don't mix thier tools between mild and stainless
applications. IE: If you use a stainless wire wheel to clean welds on mild
steel, the wheel will pick up mild steel, then contaiminate any stainless it
is used on, resulting in rust. I don't take any chances, and keep separate
wheels and buffers for stainless work.

Cheers,
Matthew
