Subject: automatic in 78 westy
Message-ID: &lt;a288660d.24a570e6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Folks,

Looking for some advice, I've been looking for westy and recently came across 
a 78 automatic in good shape.  What problems can I expect ? Is the 78 an odd 
ball year with hard to find parts ?

Is the automatic going to make it slower, and does anyone have one of these, 
are there any quirks with them ?  I have a 69 bus and was looking for 
something with a bigger motor so I can go 65-70mph...

what do you think ?
