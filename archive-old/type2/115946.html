&gt; I'm thinking of trying to check for vacuum leaks on my '79 bus and was
&gt; following the thread from HoneyBus. I was wondering what exactly did he do
&gt; with 
&gt; starting fluid?
&gt; Was he spraying it around?

A little is sprayed where a suspect hose or gasket meets a fitting.

&gt; Which throttle gasket did he
&gt; permatex 
&gt; and how much stuff did he remove to get to it?  Thanks, Laura :o)

It's the gasket between the throttle body and the air plenum. You need to
remove the air filter, the AFM, the s-boot, undo the accelerator cable and 2
screws holding on the throttle body. On some models (not yours) the linkage
for the EGR will have to be disconnected as well.
