Subject: Re: [T2] 77 FI bus - hesitation/stuttering problem FOUND (but
  not yet fixed)

Lots of lessons to be learned here.

At 12:03 PM 04/19/2003, you wrote:
&gt;  I kept assuming it was the fuel injection (I've replaced the
&gt;air flow meter before), and was ready to have the engine (which was rebuilt
&gt;not too long ago) converted to carburetion, and posted a message here asking
&gt;for help.

Every time the idea of assumption comes up, reject it and varify.

&gt;Well, my mechanic had done that and so I
&gt;assumed that was not the problem.  I replaced a lot of FI parts, and nothing
&gt;fixed the problem.

Predictably, the assumption leads to wasted time/money, more waisted than
actually required to diagnose in correct order and find and fix the problem.

&gt;     FIRST LESSON:  Everyone should get a timing light and learn how to set
&gt;your own timing!!

Know also that a static tech with an ohm meter gets me within 10 every time
on 4 cylinder dizzies. But a timing light will work on any spark ignition
motor and is a good thing to use to VERIFY.

&gt;  regapped the plugs,

I never regap plugs. Once they wear 0.2 mm, I know I'm not getting all the
energy possible. Gas mileage begins to fall.

&gt;     I pulled the distributor today, and wiped the film of oil off the
shaft,
&gt;and where the clamp sits on the shaft, the metal is all worn very shiny and
&gt;smooth!   I can only assume that this is why the clamp is not holding the
&gt;distributor the way it should.
&gt;     QUESTION:  is this something I can have a machinist &quot;roughen&quot; up so
that
&gt;the clamp will work, or do I need a new distributor (if I can even find a
&gt;&quot;new&quot; one)?  Anyone with any ideas??

You just might try a piece of shim stock. Clean the shaft then flush with
carb leaner to get it bone dry of oil. Roughen the area with 120 grit. Lay
on a thin layer of Alumaweld then hit the back side of the shim stock with
the 120 grit and wrap it around the shaft and hold in place with rubber
bands. Then use a new clamp.
