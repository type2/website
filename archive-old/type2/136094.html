Subject: Re: Am confuse!!! (very thecnical)

&gt;Here is the deal, ... to make a very long story
&gt;short, ... so like always, 006 on #1 and up to #2
&gt;but?? Now that am on #2, intake valve on #1 as now a
&gt;1/8in gap.

The above is something I've always wondered about. I
discovered long ago that TDC is not the loosest point
in the valve train on type IV engines, at least on
some of them, I haven't checked all of them. However
that, (TDC), is the point at which the valves must be
adjusted. If you adjust them at the loosest point,
they will be too tight and a compression check will
show very low, about 70-80 PSI.

Comments please?
