Subject: jet sizes

I have a 1600 dp, bone stock with a 30PICT-1 carb.  Its in a '71 campmobile,
and seems to be running a little hot--timing is mellow and all cooling tin
and new rubber seals are in place.  Motor has about 2300 miles on it.  It has
a 127 main jet; I haven't looked at the air correction jet yet.  Does anyone
know the optimum size main and air correction jets to keep the motor a little
cooler??  The geographical operating locale is Phoenix AZ--it's finally
starting to cool off here, but my motor doesn't seem to notice the
difference.

Thanks,
Buck
