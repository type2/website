I'm sure you don't drive like this, but...

My daughter learning to drive her '85 Cabriolet managed to keep loosening her
CV's.  Not only would the CV's loosen up, but also her axle nuts.  I couldn't
figure out what was causing it, until I took a ride with her.  Each time she
would shift, she would pop the clutch.  This must have put a lot of stress on
the CV and axle, causing them to loosen.

I've now been able to get her to clutch smoothly, and so far, no more CV
problems.
