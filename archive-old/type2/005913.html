+AD4-3. The basic problem involves the fact that the check
+AD4-valve (buy a NEW one from VW for +ACQ-10. or so) and the
+AD4-booster line are both 1/2+ACI- (or whatever the metric
+AD4-equivalent is) and the nipple from the manifold is
+AD4-1/8+ACIAOw- no one either at the dealer (or the FLAPS) could
+AD4-explain how to get from the big hose to the small hose+ADs-


Hold on there Dan,

My '71 has an adapter plate that installs under the carburetor with
a 12mm hose barb fitting cast into the adapter plate itself. It is cast 
out of aluminum and is the same shape as the bottom of the carburetor
and the intake manifold. 
Unfortunately I'm at work or I'd check to see if it had and VW +ACM- but 
the whole mess is stock, as I have the paperwork to prove it.

Anyone else have this plate, I hope....?
