Subject: Re: [T2] Vanagon seats in a 77?

Hi Volks,

One other &quot;Why Not&quot; just occurred to me...  Some Vanagon seats don't  
recline as far back as the original bay seats do.

Happy trails,

&gt; Hi Gary,

&gt; The only &quot;Why not&quot; would be if you're really tall. Since the  
&gt; Vanagon has a lower fender well where the seat is mounted, the seat  
&gt; itself is about an inch taller. Not a big deal for most people,  
&gt; but  it could be an issue for those who are really tall or like  
&gt; wearing fancy hats. ;-)
