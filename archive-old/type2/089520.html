Subject: Re: [T2] blown 1700 w/dual carbs - value?


&gt;
&gt; If you were parting it out, it would be fair to offer a couple hundred; as
&gt; there is a lot of stuff that you could get decent coin for on eBay.
&gt;
&gt; OTOH, if it's of no use to him, then $50 - $100 is a reasonable price.
&gt;
&gt; That's my $0.02, YMMV.

My thought was $100.  My plan was to rebuild it this winter and have a nice
fresh motor to put in Zeke next spring.  Then i could rebuild the other one
as a spare or just keep the good bits and dump the case on my old one.  I
would like to keep the enigine in my bus as close to original as possible.
I know that my bus is a 73 with a 72 motor, but oh-well.  thanks for the
info.
