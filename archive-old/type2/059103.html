Well, if the work is just getting rid of the water jackets, all you
need is a few minutes on a big band saw.  Never seen it done, though.

If you're planning on building a big engine, you're still left with
the problem of cooling the cylinders.  Type 1 cooling systems are
designed to cool a maximum of 1600cc.  Since bus engines are called
upon to put out their full power for extended periods, we can't rely
on thermal mass to save the engine as a bug driver who doesn't use all
the power continuously) would.

Anyone have a web reference on this conversion?  I'd _love_ to have an
aluminum type 1 case!
