Subject: Re: [T2] Distributor Vacuum Advance(Is this correct)??  


&gt;You are sort of on the right track.
&gt;You should have a dual vacuum unit dist, correct?

Yes I have 2 vacum hoses coming out of the distributor

&gt;Moving the breaker plate and capping the nipple on the advance unit is &gt;not 
&gt;a
&gt;very good test. You may be moving the plate the wrong way and capping &gt;the
&gt;wrong nipple.
&gt;Not sure where Muir came up with 7.5 after. No fuel injected 1800 [ED 
&gt; &gt;engine]
&gt;ever timed at that number. The correct figure is 5 after. BUT this is &gt;only 
&gt;if
&gt;the retard side has vacuum and it is at idle.

I may have remembered wrong while posting...it could very well have been 5 
after...there is a red dot on the dial that I was setting it to.

I've been setting the timing with the engine shut off and with a volt meter 
measureing where the distributor got power...is this the wrong way??



&gt;DOES the inboard pointing hose have vacuum at idle?

The vacum hose that goes to the dome side has vacum...the hose on the flat 
side doesn't...should it??

&gt;If no, trace the hose back and find out why.
&gt;If yes, does the timing change when you disconnect it at idle?

The idle speed changes when I disconect does this indicate a timing change??
&gt;If no, then you have a bad vacuum unit.

Thanks for any help
Jon
