Subject: Re: [T2] 80 vanagon adventures

&gt; I've got a couple of questions:
 &gt;1. Do all 81 Vanagons have fresh air blowers and 80's not?

Mine does not.  I stuck a fan on the dashboard.

&gt; 2. My 80 has only a bin instead of a glove box. Is this an 80 only Westy
&gt; thing?

I would assume so, but as I have only seen two 80 Vanagons I cannot be sure
about that.

By the way, my 80 Vanagon is still for sale in central FL.  Email for
details/pictures.
