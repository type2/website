Subject: RE: [T2] Can I borrow a backyard in Bellingham, WA?

What would be really cool is if we could all pool our money together and
purchase this in the name of Type2.  What better donation to the list than a
whole bunch of VW's.  We could keep the Bus stuff and sell the rest.  I
would be willing to pitch in for something like this.  I would really like
some parts off of that 77 Westy!

Just wishful thinking,
