Subject: Re: [T2] Gas in my oil

Thanks John,

&gt; Gas in oil is a symptom of running rich.

Idle feels good, maybe pressure regulator?  Maybe no way to fix running rich
with worn rings?

If you pull the hose off
&gt; the black cap and put your finger up towards the cap outlet while the
&gt; engine is running and feel a lot of air blowing on your finger, you
&gt; have excessive blowby in your crankcase, again caused by worn rings.

Yes, there is a LOT of air blowing out.  Plugging the hole with my finger
will make it stall, and the air smells like it has some gas fumes in it. I
suppose that could be from the oil. Compression feels good (haven't tested)
but bad rings may not affect that much? I better test it.  Engine was
rebuilt by a shop not too long ago (approx 20K ago), but before I got it.  I
get the feeling from lurking on the list that all rings are not equal and
may not even be replaced by some rebuilds.

I still don't get where oil and gas get together unless worn rings are
leaking one or the other.

Thanks Nik
