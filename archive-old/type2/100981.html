Subject: Fuel pump

HI Ben,
	I did have a fuel pump die just like that.  I attribute it to
running the gas tank down too low earlier in it's career and
starving/overheating the pump. AMHIK By looking at the check marks on the
diagnostic pages in the manuals used by the PO I think it, and the under
plenum grounds, had been a problem before.

	I agree with Billy, check the voltages right at the pump.  IMHOP
10.5 vdc should be enough to get some action at the pump. Test the pump
also by bringing 12vdc directly to the pump while observing the output,
that way you can do it without an assistant.  Try not to draw sparks off
the terminals while pumping gas. It should make a &quot;whirring&quot; noise during
operation.  Silence with DC on the terminals is not &quot;golden&quot;.  I use a
pre-filter and we have heard many times on the list about crud in the tank
blocking the outlet on VW's.  That may be a problem also.
  I now carry two tested spares retrieved from Pick and Pulls ($10 ea).

&gt;the fuel pump voltage when cranking and it was 10.5V. Presumably

Did you check the voltage at the fuel pump itself? Make sure wire is
continuous from relay to pump. What is the voltage?
