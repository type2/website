First I want to say a big THANK YOU to Charlie and Al, and ncbus for all the suggestions last night.  Although it turned out to be none of them.. lol. it was however, the Pertronix electronic ignition that we bought and installed in mid february.  It only lasted a little over 5 months. We had to drop back to the points system, and all seems fine.  Does any one know if there is a warrarnty on these systems?  It was purchased from Bus Depot.  The problem was that it was overheating and there was no way to keep the bus running, it would just die.
Again, thanks to the list for all the help... as always, ya'll are a great bunch.
Gail Doles
