Thanks to every one involved in putting on Everybus.
I had a great time talking with old and new friends.
It was great to see so many buses together.
The AIRS list save my butt on the way home.
I had a rear wheel bearing go out in Suffolk,Va.
on Monday morning. I pulled out my Airs list and called
a fellow named Jason in Va. Beach. He let me leave my beloved (DHARMA)
at his house until I could return to get it with a trailor.
I could have fixed it ther but I had to be back to work at 2:00 am Tues.
morning.
A great big thank you to him and everyone on the list.
Thanks,
 Dave Parsons
