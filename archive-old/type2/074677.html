Subject: Re: [T2] vw rubber floor mats

Depends where you are. Shipping will kill just about any good 'deal', even free
ones. The large cargo one is heavy and bulky. I buy them for 2 to 3 bucks each
at the local pick n pull but then it also costs 2 to enter [Pick a Part just
went up to 2!] + .57 environmental[?] tax + .08 sales tax on the entrance fee +
7.625 sales tax on the parts. At $2 each that equals 6 + 2 + .08 + .57 + .46 =
$9.11 and that is not counting the gas to go over to the yard. $10 is a very
fair price....except for me they are in Ohio, I am in Fresno, Calif..... the
shipping would be too high.


&gt; Hello all, what is a good price for a set of floor mats.  The rubber on my
&gt; 74 is torn and sections are missing.  If anyone has any for less than below
&gt; let me know.
