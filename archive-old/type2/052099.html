Hi All,

last night my poor bus sat in the rain all night long (it is usually in the
garage).. and this morning it would not start.  It is usually a little hard
to start in the morning (i think I have a bad cold start valve).. but it
usually starts by the second or third try.  This morning it will not start
at all.  It sounds like there is no spark at all.

My question is this.. could the heavy rain all night have cased any
problems?  maybe some condensation somewhere causing electrical probs?

Thanks for any ideas,

cheers
