&gt; I'm wondering if I can install the battery somewhere inside the cab
&gt; and vent it to the outside of the bus (or into the engine compartment)
&gt; to release gases when charging. Maybe that's even overkill. I just
&gt; don't know much of anything about the gases released by batteries and
&gt; the dangers thereof. Any insight would be appreciated.

Joe, check out   http://www.dcbattery_dot_com/optima2.html . These batteries
require no venting and can be place in any position.
