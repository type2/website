Subject: Re: starting problem

The lights-on-while-starting (use the interior light if you have a car with
headlight-cut-off on the starter) will diagnose the cables, and I understand
Kim has figured this out, it is likely her starter with integral solenoid is
the problem, likely due to poor workmanship in the rebuild.
