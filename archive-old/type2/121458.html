Subject: RE: [T2] Part needed

&gt;Who mounted a switch on the B pillar on your Westy?
&gt;I have never seen one on a Westy, only on buses.

My 77 parts Westy has a switch mounted for the light also on the b pillar,
while neither my 76 had nor my 78 has it.  I did find a bag of switches with
my 77 so I'm sure it was added on later.  It doesn't look very stock to me.
