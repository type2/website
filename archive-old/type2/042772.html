I agree! We just did this adjustment yesterday. You should feel some
resistance while turning the steering  wheel past the center position (when
wheels facing straight ahead). We didn't have to turn the screw much at all
to fix this. It's good to do with a helper who can feel the resistance on
the steering wheel as you turn the screw on the steering box.

We had zero resistance prior to the adjustment and the wheel literally flew
out of my grip when we hit a bump. It's much better now but the bus still
meanders a bit on the road. All other examinations show no other problems
tho... it seems to be what it does in the wind. I'm a brand new driver of a
VW bus so I have to get used to it. At least I've stopped saying &quot;whooooaaa&quot;
as we turn every corner!  ;-) We get our new 185R14s load Cs on monday and
then inspection and alignment on tuesday. :-D
