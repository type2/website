Subject: 74 Westy for sale near Dallas, Tx.

I saw an ad for a '74 Westy in the paper yesterday, &quot;Needs work&quot;.  No price.  Called and got some information on it.  It is in Arlington (between Dallas and Ft. Worth).  Color is green and it's an Automatic.  FI has been replaced with a single Weber.  Transaxle and 1800 engine have both been rebuilt - supposedly runs very well.  Minor rust under the windshield but he says it's a solid bus.  Pop top canvas is new.  The &quot;work&quot; needed sounds pretty minor - he said something about the brakes needing a little work, and I think some minor interior work.  Sounds like it has been well taken care of.

Price was $2,400 but I think it is negotiable.
