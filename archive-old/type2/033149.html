Subject: Re: Regular vs Premium

Doug,

Thanks for the tip, but it only proves my point,
though I probably didn't say it properly. I *should*
have said that If you are not experiencing any &quot;ping&quot;,
or knock that is related to low octane, you will be
fine. If you carefuly re-read the FAQ page (Page 4/4),
you will see they say the exact same thing.

And yes, &quot;Octane is octane&quot;, as you so eloquently put
it....doesn't really take a rocket-scientist to know
that. I said that there were two seperate methods of
rating octane, which you readily agreed to in your
reply.

I know that in the 3 busses (as well as the other 6
vehicles I've owned that wanted leaded/higher octane
fuel), I've not had a problem with unwanted knock.
Only with newer vehicles. Also, I probably know in the
neighborhood of 100 various VW enthuisiasts, and none
have claimed any problems related to octane rating (at
least not to me; and yes, I did ask many of them;-).

If you want to shell out the extra cash simply because
it makes you feel good, hey, more power to you (no pun
intended!).


This is why I called this subject a FART....

ftp://rtfm.mit_dot_edu/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/rec/autos/tech/

&gt; Read a little, learn a lot.

&gt; Octane does not effect your mileage, only the life
&gt; of your
&gt; engine.

&gt; &gt; Geez, next to oil preferences, this is probably
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; oldest FART
&gt; (Frequently-Annoying-Recurring-Thread;-)
&gt; &gt; around.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A quick check of the archives reveals that the
&gt; &gt; European method of measuring octane is different
&gt; than
&gt; &gt; in the U.S., so the 91-RON rating on the inside of
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; fuel cap is meaningless unless converted to U.S.
&gt; &gt; standards.
