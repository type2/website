Subject: VANFEST - now has it's own web site
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

Those list members in the UK will certainly have heard of VANFEST but for 
those not in the know it is an annual show and rally for VW Vans - certainly 
the biggest &quot;VW vans only&quot; show in the UK and probably in Europe (if not the 
world) too.

The show which is organised by the VW Type 2 Owners Club (www.vwt2oc_dot_org_dot_uk) 
now has its own web site so any one who has a blank date in their diary for 
14-16 September 2001 should point their browsers at www.vanfest_dot_org 

If you just want to see some of what goes on in the UK van show scene then 
take a look too as there are reports of previous shows on the site too.

Good luck
