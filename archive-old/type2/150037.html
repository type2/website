Subject: Re: [T2] The mystery Single Cab

What is weird is that it is a numbers matching 71. It even has the brake
booster plate on the front beam but it has never been used. The beam itself
hasn't been removed. Also the dash doesn't have a cigarette lighter and the
headlight switch is on the left of the steering column.

I wonder if this was a special order from the factory or someone's hack job.
It is possible, my 70 Double Cab had a 68 front beam with a 68 master
cylinder (since corrected).

???????

&gt; How sure are we this is a 71?

&gt;  it has wide-5 wheels and drum brakes!
