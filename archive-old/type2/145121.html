&gt; Not anymore. GM won a lawsuit prohibiting Chery from using their name in the
&gt; U.S.. So Malcolm Bricklin will have to pick another name for his Chinese
&gt; Yugo.

I don't normally side with GM, but in this case they have a definite bone
to pick.  GM designed a minicar for the Chinese market.  A few months
later Chery brought out a car so close to the GM design that the parts
interchange.  With China's lack of enforcment of intellectual property
rights the Chery is outselling the GM car 4-to-1.

I have a feeling that the first car that Bricklin imports will be
purchased by GM, who will tear it to pieces looking for their design.  The
US does enforce IP laws!

Bricklin is also playing the &quot;make the dealers put up the money&quot; game.
His claims of the &quot;number of dealers on board&quot; dropped from 200 to less
than 20 the last time I read anything about it.

Now if someone could just get the Chinese to repro beetles...
