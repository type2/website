Subject: Fwd: Re: [T2] Idle problem

&gt;John: I see that you have an assortment of ACVWs that is much like 
&gt;mine. I too had a 1600DP engine that I could not get to idle. I 
&gt;eventually gave up and parted it out.

I'm curious as to exactly which hose this was. The vent hose that I'm 
familiar with goes to the big vapor recovery cannister. Was this the 
one that was crimped?

Jack
