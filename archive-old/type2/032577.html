This subject has come up before, and I've assumed the writer had a badly worn 
distributor.

A recent experience raises another possibility for the incompatible point gap 
and dwell specs.

I have a benchtop engine analyzer that's 110 AC powered, but I rarely use it 
to tune our 1970 Campmobile with a stock 1600 SP.  

Instead I use a much smaller 12V unit that is basically a tach and dwell meter 
with a few added functions.  This unit has been very reliable, and the 
accuracy has been excellent.

Recently I installed a dash-mounted tach, and was puzzled to find a 
significant difference in the readings it obtained in comparison to the 12V 
analyzer.  After a lot of cross-checking with other meters/tachs, it became 
clear that my 12V analyzer had suffered some sort of internal seizure.  Both 
the tach and dwell functions were inaccurate, and the percentage of error 
wasn't consistent with a selector switch failure (# of cylinders, voltage, 
etc.)   In the past when I set new points very carefully at a loose .016, the 
dwell reading with the 12V analyzer would be 49 degrees, right in the 
ballpark.

I guess the point here is that if your distributor shaft isn't loose and 
wobbly and you still have to close the points a lot to get a proper dwell 
reading, the problem may not be in the distributor.  Of course, you need to 
read the dwell meter correctly, too.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps someone could explain why we must bend the specs a bit to achieve 
the end result.  Oh, yeah, '77 - stock dizzy (et al) -  I thought maybe after 
the rebuild this phenomena would be resolved, but no... &lt;&lt;
