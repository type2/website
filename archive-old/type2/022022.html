The recent discussion of FI vs. carbs is very timely. I was delayed on 
getting my 75 1800 bus engine rebuild finished waiting on front and rear oil 
seals to arrive. Big moment came last night when my son and I lifted the 
engine off the engine stand on to my home-made engine dolly. There it sit in 
all its glory with fresh painted sheet metal.

I have a unique engine-building system in that for some reason I clean the 
sheet metal and then lay it aside and wait to paint it when I'm actually 
ready to install it. That's probably the proscrastinator's method. I have the 
rear tin in primer and will paint it tonight and let it dry a short while and 
carefully place it on the engine and 
install the engine! 

I found a like-new single webber carb at a Porsche swap meet for $50 and 
bought the runners and rubber bellow pieces from the guys who advertise in 
Hot VWs for $59. If this thing runs to suit me and since I got the carb 
conversion at bargain-basement prices, I'll be parting out my working 75 fuel 
injection pieces at reasonable prices for spare travel parts. 

Email me off-line with what pieces you want with a reasonable bid and I'll be 
able to let you know during the next week if I'm going to sell the stuff.
