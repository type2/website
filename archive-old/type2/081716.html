Subject: Need Westy Ice Tray

Hi all, I am still looking for an ice tray for a 1970 Westfalia.  One guy
had one but I haven't been able to get in touch with him again now that I
fianlly have my bus back from trans. work and can measure to see what size
mine is.  If you are out there Karl and you still have it, please Email try
glenward22_at_aol_dot_com. Thanks!  Glen Ward
