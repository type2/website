&gt; Hey all:
&gt; Someone posted a week or so ago that the ride in their loaf was too stiff
&gt; with the installation of KYB Gas A justs (or however it's spelled). Anyone
&gt; else have a similar problem? Just ordered a set for my loaf, and in
&gt; hindsight, am worried about jarring the fillings out of my teeth.

I put KYB Gas-A-Justs, whatever, ;) in the back of my 79 and they are a
little harsh when I'm empty, and when I go over railroad tracks. They're
great on dirt roads though.  I left the stock shocks on the front,  so
I'd be interested in how the KYB's are on the front. I was also
wondering if Bilstein still made shocks for buses, and if anyone had
experience with them? I put them on an Alfa Romeo sedan I had and the
ride was like velvet....Maybe Bilsteins on the front?
