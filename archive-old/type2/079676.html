Subject: Re: [T2] re:Old Paint

Color-Back was one I've used several times to get the oxidized paint off 
initially. I see it in the stores from time to time. Was mostly a solvent 
and a cream polish. Required wax. Turtle Wax makes a good cheap rubbing 
compound - one is red for hard rubbing (abrasive) and one has a white cream 
in a green can for lighter polishing before waxing. I see it in most of the 
regular parts stores.

Sounds like a good time to learn to use a powered polisher.

Anything Meguiar and anything 3-M. Meguiar has a consumer line of products 
you'll see in the stores and a better line you have to order (more 
extensive and expensive). 3-M can be gotten at NAPA and any paint and body 
supplier. My father - street rodder swears by 3-M. Most of the Meguiar 
stuff I see in the stores seems to be finish waxes. 3-M has bunches of 
stuff for inital rubbing to polishing to finish waxing.

I like Zymol for a top coat wax. I have heard that the Wal-Mart version 
isn't as potent as the professional stuff but then at least I can afford 
the store version. The pro stuff is $100 I think(?)

If you've got oxidized paint problems - rub and buff it and use any good 
wax that you find. Doubt any will do that much better than the competition 
b/c the paint has failed and will need regular upkeep to stay glossy. That 
mostly rules out expensive waxes that claim to last longer than anyone else 
in my opinion. All of them will need to be renewed monthly or more.

&gt; &gt;3) Remove the oxidation with HAND compound.
&gt; &gt;5)put on a nice coat of hand glaze. This seals the surface
&gt; &gt;and evens out small pits.
&gt; &gt;6)Use a good quality carnauba wax. That's all you need.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I do agree however that a good Carnuba wax is probably the best--however
&gt;read what's in all the waxes
