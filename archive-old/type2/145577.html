What do you suppose it weighs now with all the rust???  ;)

Sounds like an exciting, yet somewhat stressful trip you had. How long do you predict it will take you to restore it? Are you worried about finding the replacement sheetmetal?

&gt;It's amazing how much power there really is with a 2200 Lb. bus and a 40HP
&gt;motor. This bus is bone stock, with the original reduction gears (not
&gt;IRS). 60 was not a problem....unless I was being passed by a semi.
&gt;Wow...makes Vanagon's (and Bays) feel stable.
