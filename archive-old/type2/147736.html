Subject: Re: [T2] front of bus bike mount

Hi Alan,

Jamie Rivers recently built a nice rack for a mini-bike, but the pic  
he posted is no longer online. It bolts into a receiver hitch  
installed below the front bumper.

Things to watch for: Be sure not to obscure the license plate, the  
headlights, turn signals, or the driver's view of the road.



Happy trails,

Greg Potts
