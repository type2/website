OMG, that's hilarious... a goat house?

I can only imagine the mess they had to clean up...

-------------- Original message from type2-digest-help_at_type2_dot_com: -------------- 
&gt; Hey Chris,
&gt; The only one I know about is in an 82 diesel we sold Robert in 
&gt; Highpoint (was veggie werks). the vanagon was used as a goat house after the 
&gt; engine 
&gt; broke the timing belt so the transmission should be just what your looking 
&gt; for. 
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry I don't know how to get a hold of him, but if you go to the business 
&gt; section on the full moon bus club site I believe theres a phone # an address. 
&gt; 
&gt; hope this helps 
&gt;
