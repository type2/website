Subject: Re: cool and fragrant

Not that I recommend putting a paper gasket behind your flywheel.
In my younger days I regularly made my own paper (normal writing paper
even!) gaskets for anything from carb gaskets to case/oil seal gaskets on
the small motor bikes I re-built. The paper always seemed to hold up, and
last well. (I'd get a cheap bike with a blown motor, re-build it, very
dodgily, ride it for 6-12mths sell it for a profit and get the next one).
A proper gasket will do a better job, but paper does work if need be. Just
make sure the you use the correct thickness.
