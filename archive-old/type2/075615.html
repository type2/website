Subject: RE: [T2] Fuel Pump for a 78

On those fuel injected f*rd vehicles in question there are two fuel pumps,
one in tank, and one frame mounted. The in tank pump is a low pressure &quot;lift
pump&quot; to supply fuel to the frame mounted high pressure fuel injection pump.
The frame mounted pump is the one you want.  It varies in location on the
particular model you scrounge off of.  But fuel injected rangers and f150's
from 85 to 88 have these pumps.  Other models and years may have them but
you have to verify that yourself. When I went to get mine from the scrap
yard it was already pulled and sitting on the sales rack.

Again,  I hope that helps.

&gt; P. S.  Only my dad is allowed to slam me publicly,
&gt; like you just did.  And that is even up to question.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe bus ownership gives us all a different way of
&gt; looking at things.
&gt; 
&gt; I can guarantee you that I have had many more
&gt; experiences packed into these 28 years than many
&gt; people twice my age.
&gt; 
&gt; PS, help me fix my pump!!

&gt; &gt; Not even Bosch can rebuild a Bosch FI fuel pump.
&gt; &gt; Watch out for that $127
&gt; &gt; rebuild by who????? If you want the most money when
&gt; &gt; your 60, pay the price
&gt; &gt; for a new Bosch pump now. Compromise is great risk
&gt; &gt; of pain for your wallet. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You wallet just ain't deep enough to carry the
&gt; &gt; freight??? Bust ass, get an
&gt; &gt; evening part time job. If you ain't got enough
&gt; &gt; time/money to make it work
&gt; &gt; for sure, how do you justify throwing away money on
&gt; &gt; cheap?????? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hit a junkyard, take your chances. Look for a
&gt; &gt; possible newer replacement
&gt; &gt; pump on a ratty chassis. Sometimes you get lucky.
&gt; &gt; The risk is quick failure
&gt; &gt; of an old pump that has been inactive for more than
&gt; &gt; a year. Might work a
&gt; &gt; week, might work for an hour, might not work at all.
&gt; &gt; You risk all with
&gt; &gt; hopin' and guessin'. You risk nothing with a new
&gt; &gt; Bosch pump, if you install
&gt; &gt; it correctly, and put in a new filter to insure
&gt; &gt; results. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Criminy, if you can afford 5 vehicles, two of which
&gt; &gt; are less than 4 years
&gt; &gt; old,  how is it you can't afford a new pump, how is
&gt; &gt; it you can afford to
&gt; &gt; throw money at squeeky cheap on the VW so's you can
&gt; &gt; make the mortgage
&gt; &gt; payments on the newer rides,????

&gt; &gt; &gt;Fellow Bus owners:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have figured out that my fuel pump is locked up
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; &gt;something. I took it out and it whirs, but it will
&gt; &gt; not
&gt; &gt; &gt;pull gas.  Is there a way of fixing it?  Paying
&gt; &gt; $127~
&gt; &gt; &gt;for a rebuilt pump is out of my league right now. 
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt;have bid on one on Ebarf and some guy bids it up
&gt; &gt; &gt;higher.  Anyways, anybody have a used one for sale
&gt; &gt; for
&gt; &gt; &gt;cheap, That works?  Can I cut mine open, free the
&gt; &gt; &gt;obstruction or rust, and have my room mate tig weld
&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt;back together?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Any Ideas? Any Help?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks
