&gt;install a cigg outlet, and buy an inverter and a little floor heater?

The little floor heaters are 1500 watts.  A 1500 watt inverter is $500, not
to mention that it would suck your battery dry in a matter of minutes, even
with the engine running.  There is a good reason why nobody uses electric
heaters in cars.  Something about conservation of energy.  :-)

&gt;A friend is taking a 74 westy up to OR and is going to freeze her azz off
&gt;unless I do something to help.

As they say in Scandanavia, there is no bad weather, only bad clothes.  Buy
her some mittens and long underwear.

&gt;If theres an aftermarket heater I could install that would be just as easy
&gt;and a little more long term, id be willing to give that a shot.

No aftermarket heater installation is going to be simple.

Sorry for the bad news.
