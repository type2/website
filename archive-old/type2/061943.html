&gt; Re: Westy Tent Poles - roll yer own

&gt;  His point was that the copper
&gt; was cheaper and about half as heavy as the 3/4&quot; conduit. His points were
&gt; well taken but I wonder which tent would remain standing longer in very bad
&gt; weather. Hopefully none of us will find out.

Electrical conduit is also availible in aluminum, and in several sizes. This 
should be a better weight to strength tradeoff. My guess is that the copper
(water pipes?) would be even worse than the steel conduit.

It (steel conduit at least) is also bendable with a &quot;conduit bender&quot; ($10-15 
Hechinger, Home depot or similar).

&gt; 
&gt; I recognise that Dan mentioned his using the OEM poles on his set up. What
&gt; considerations has anyone else or Dan given to the &quot;dirt&quot; end of the poles?
&gt; Rubber plugs? Tack welding short spikes on them?

Duct tape. Also prevents ends from scratching things when put down 
in the under the rear seat storage.

(With no real westy tent, only an el-cheapo awning.)
