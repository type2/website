	Hi Shawn,

Just had to reply on this one.

Never tought abut it that way. My ´71 Kombiwagen is insulated by the PO. I
only know it works the other way around. In the mornings when I jump into
my bus it´s always colder inside the bus than on the outside. The
insulation keeps the cold night air in the bus :-)
