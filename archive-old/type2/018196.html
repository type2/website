Subject: Heater-box flaps from fan housing
Message-ID: &lt;374C3FE8.7A1359B3_at_jps_dot_net&gt;

I was replacing the exaust manifold back onto my newly rebuilt engine on
my '78 Westfalia, when I noticed the two metal flaps that go between the
vents at the bottom of the fan housing to openings in  the heater-box
assembly. No matter which way I tried to fit them, they didn't seem to
want to be there. Yet I remember them somehow fitting when I took off
the exhaust. So I ended up just leaving them off. Is this a very bad
thing? Does anyone know how they are supposed to work and fit? Thanks.
