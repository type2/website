if you keep losing the same cyl something somewhere is wrong, fix that or
you will keep losing valves, possibly the intake runner to #3 is partially
blocked giving that cyl a lean condition?  or an air leak in that runner??

&gt; Our new house doesn't even have a driveway, let alone a garage, and I really
&gt; can't imaging doing this job on the street.  I've got tons of things I need to
&gt; fix in our house (104 years old) and prepare for winter and really don't have

I know the feeling my old house is 92 years old and I live in a major city
and don't have a driveway etc.   BUT I have rented a nearby garage to
store parts in and work on the bus when needed.   my bus needs some work
on it too. and my house is only part shingled, gotta get both done by real
cold weather.

&gt; the time for this project.  Maybe you can slap on a new head in a few hours, but
&gt; it would take me much longer!  I've done it once before and had a mechanic do it
&gt; the second time.

first time is the hardest.

&gt; I've been at this juncture before, and I've put thousands of dollars into this

and you will put that much more into anything else you get.   pick up a
junker for the spare car and don't give your hard earned $$$ to the next
guy to get your bus....your almost there.

&gt; bus already.  Time for me to move on.  I just want to know how long I can get by
&gt; with the bus in this kind of shape.

15minutes,  15 hours, 15 days, 15 months.  it's a crap shot  and how much
you think you can get for a bus with a known bad cyl????  you would have
to be honest and tell anyone looking at it that.

good luck
Bob
