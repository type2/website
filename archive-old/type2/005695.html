Greetings -

I just couldn't stop thinking about the person who wanted to put a taller
tranny in his bus. Seems like a reasonable thing to do, and improve on the
standard design.

This is how my bus got be as it is, and it's not done yet, I'm sure. I
wanted a &quot;bit more power&quot;, so I could handle some traffic situations with
the gas pedal instead of... well, you know.. getting the heck out of the
way. So...

1) The 1915 seemed reasonable. But I'm still in third gear before I get out
of the driveway! The 1915 can't &quot;spread it's wings&quot;, so to speak.
2) The 091 tranny seemed reasonable to lower RPMs. Now I'm running at (or
near) the torque peak at 60mph, and can &quot;gas it&quot; to pass, if I need to. But
the clutch seems to be overstressed, and is starting to chatter.
3) The Kennedy Stage 1 should last a while. But I was worried that the fan
wouldn't turn enough air to cool the engine.
4) A 2-quart oil sump, and an external oil cooler adapter/cooler gives me 6
quarts of cool oil to make up for the less air cooling. Sure, it'll cost
that extra few bucks at the &quot;Lube &amp; Fly&quot;, but it's worth it. But now that my
average speeds are higher (and I'm so concerned for the welfare of my
family).
5) Front discs are in order. Of course, ever thinking of the future (when
that 2110cc torque monster will adorn my Westy), I'm (as you know) looking
for larger diameter wheels, to get that RPM down to the magic 3000 _at_ 60mph
(what makes it magical? I dunno...). It sure leans a lot in those corners
I'm taking way too fast.
6) Anti-sway bars. Whoops! Maybe some smaller diameter wheels/tires to lower
the COG... Shoot. That raises the RPM. Where's that Gene Berg 5-speed?

And on.. and on... and on... Maybe I should leave the damn thing alone, and
accept it for what it is (was). I know, I'll get a Beetle, and breeeeth on
it a little...

Enjoy -
