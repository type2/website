Volks,
Just FYI here...
Finally dropped the engine (126,000mi) from the 75 and found that the exhaust valve in cylinder three had hammered its valve seat back up into the exhaust port - you could see it sticking up into the port all mangled and curled.  The symptoms (i was thinking i had a hole in something.;]) were unburned oil in the exhaust (it was dripping from a cracked/rusted area on the pipe just before the muffler), a nice clean and wet un-fired spark plug in cylinder three and the general feeling that 'this thing just ain't hittin' on all four'... wouldn't do over 30 mph...

Sure was fun pulling that engine, though. i had some help, but i really could've done it on my own. It was so easy. Of course, i had it stripped down so that it looked like a vw engine before i started loosening engine bolts. My auto tranny _does_ have rear mounts, btw.

Anyway - BBTA-ers: you WILL see me in Sept.  ;]
