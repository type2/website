Subject: Re: [T2] Could I have found THE problem?

You had at least better remove the heads and have a good head shop inspect
them.  Chances are your head studs just backed the nuts off with time, but
you may have developed a &quot;blow by&quot; situation which will in time cut a
channel in the cylinder to head mating surface causing that cylinder to
loose it's compression.

If the only problem you have on the heads turns out to be loose studs, a
simple and inexpensive fly cutting procedure will clean them up.

&gt; Listees,
&gt; I know that I have found A problem, but I am not sure
&gt; if it is THE problem.  I am in the process of
&gt; dismantling a 1972 1700 dual carb'ed engine from my
&gt; bus.  It has been sitting on the table in my shop
&gt; since September, so my recollection of all of the
&gt; reasons for removal and eventual overhaul is a little
&gt; fuzzy.  Here is what I remember...
&gt; 
&gt; -Frequent backfire, especially when starting and
&gt; occasionally when downshifting.
&gt; 
&gt; -Loss of power - I was told that the compression was
&gt; bad, I don't recall any of the important numbers or
&gt; pressure readings from the trip to the mechanic - good
&gt; reason to keep a notebook or journal handy I suppose.
&gt; 
&gt; -Overheating and some smoking after driving more than
&gt; 20 miles.
&gt; 
&gt; I had two well recommended VW mechanics look at it.
&gt; The first one indicated that the crank case studs may
&gt; have been elongated as a result of severe overheating.
&gt; The second one indicated that I needed to replace the
&gt; heads.  Neither one of them went any further than
&gt; sticking their heads in the engine compartment and
&gt; running compression checks.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I finally removed all (most) of the accessories
&gt; and the shrouds and I immediately noticed something
&gt; wrong.  Keep in mind, I am not a mechanic, this is the
&gt; most ambitious mechanical endeavor I have taken.  I
&gt; have exposed the four top crank case studs on each
&gt; side and two nuts were not secured to the studs.  Both
&gt; forward studs did not have the nuts on them.  In fact,
&gt; the washers and nuts were laying on the case next to
&gt; their respective stud.  Looks like someone forgot to
&gt; finish the job during the last re-build.  When I
&gt; bought it, the PO informed me that he owned it for
&gt; about a year and neither removed nor performed any
&gt; major work to the engine.  He claimed that the bus
&gt; always ran well for him, but he only took a couple of
&gt; trips longer than 50 miles, it was mainly an in-town
&gt; vehicle.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to my current financial situation, I would like to
&gt; not buy new heads unless they are absolutely
&gt; necessary.  I would like to put the nuts on the studs
&gt; and piece it back together.  Is there a chance that
&gt; damage has been done by not having the nuts secured to
&gt; the studs?  Can I replace the nuts and call it good?
&gt; Or would I be better off continuing the dismantling to
&gt; look for other problems?  At the least I am going to
&gt; expose the remaing studs to see if the remaining nuts
&gt; are in place, check the torque etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry for the long post, but any advice would be
&gt; welcomed.  I have been lurking in the list for a
&gt; couple of months and all of the posts have given me
&gt; the courage to tackle this project.  Thanks in
&gt; advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Peace,
&gt; Billy Ray
