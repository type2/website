Subject: Alternator

I am chasing a charging problem on my '75 bus. I read 14 VDC on the D+
terminal on the voltage regulator (engine running). But, I'm only reading
12.5 VDC at the battery with big red wire from the Alternator going straight
to the battery (again, engine running). I got underneath the bus and lightly
pulled on the big red wire at the Alternator with needle nose pliers and it
seems to be attached, although, I can't see the B+ connection on the
alternator because of the tin. Bad Alternator?  Or possibly a bad connection
on the  B+ connection at the Alternator? Thanks.

The wishing I didn't have to pull my Alternator...
