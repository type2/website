You will have to remove the fan housing, but in my mind that's a whole lot
easier than removing the engine and *then* removing the fan housing.  But
if you're removing the engine anyway, you don't have to worry about it,
right?  BTW, it's remotely possible that replacing the motor mounts will
help or cure your shuddering problem.
