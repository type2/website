Subject: 74 on the road..

Howdy!

	(this is a bit longish..sorry)

	A couple of years ago I saved a fairly clean 74 bus from the scrap
yard. The owner thought it was completely shot (bad tranny and bad
engine (dual carbs)). I got it for a couple hundred and drove it home
(barely). A $2 bushing fixed the transaxle (front shifter bushing) and
upon pulling the engine, I saw that the crossover between the intakes
had no rubber, but instead had hoses composed almost entirely of duct
tape.... A trip to NAPA yielded nothing, since they refused to sell a
hose that was not for its original purpose (I will not step into another
NAPA) so I headed for a truly fantastic parts store here in Santa Rosa
(Jordan's) and they let me wander around their store room seeing what I
could modify to work. Success, and I had the engine back in. 

	Shortly after this, my son was born, my time was filled, my bus sat....
until yesterday, when I went, registered it, smogged it, and drove it :
)   (BIG smiley face)

	Several years ago I got a friend's Triumph (that had been parked for
years) going for him. Fired it up and took off. At 40 mph that speed
bump looked about 6 foot high.... I got it going and forgot to check the
brakes.... Why do I mention this now??? guess......

	Fortunately, 2 of the 4 wheels have functioning brakes, and those are
the front... No kinetic bodywork on the bus, but I do need a new front
seat.... By this afternoon, I should once again have a fully functional
bus (which my wife calls the great pumpkin... ugh)

	Next on the list of things to do to the bus, I have been getting parts
together to add a CIS injection system (I HATE synching carbs..) and
eventually, replacing the rear quarter panel with some off of a 68-71
bus, filling those tail light holes, and putting in tail lights off a 48
chevy.... and repainting the ugly thing (after the usual replacement of
the sheet metal around the windshield...). Will have front seats out of
a Toyota mini van, and be insulated and soundproofed ala
http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/index.html 

	Has anyone had any problems cutting out the short walls behind the
front seats? I was just playing with the idea....
