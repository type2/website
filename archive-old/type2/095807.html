Subject: Battery Isolator Installed...

Thanks to all who replied and helped me with my battery isolator problem.
With the advise of the majority I took the thing back to Napa and went to an
RV supplier and bought one for $15 (half the price).  At first they tried to
sell me the same thing until I told them didn't want it to be hooked into
the alternator and they then pulled out the appropriate part.  I hooked it
up in about five minutes and it is working great.  I am also happy to report
that, by replacing the battery isolator, I am now able to use the timer to
charge the battery without blowing a fuse.  I have been having this problem
ever since I bought the bus in '95.
Thanks Again!
