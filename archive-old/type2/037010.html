Subject: MPG of a 74 Bus

I looked in the archives and it seems that a 74
bus should get 17-19mpg. Is this true? I had a 77
FI and it sucked, 10-12mpg. Was it just not tuned
right or do the 1800cc's with carbs get better
MPG? My wife is not happy about me getting this
Bus due to the poor gas use of my other Busses
(had a 70 also). Is there anything I can do to
get better MPG. The Bus is a Kombi, no camper
interior, no pop-top, no sunroof, just about as
stripped as you can find them with both rear
seats. I assume this will help, but is there more
I can do, should I change carbs or rejet the
stock ones? What exhaust is best,dizzy, etc..If I
am to keep this Bus, it will have to get at least
18mpg or the wife will not be happy.
I was also told that the 1800cc heads were the
best of the type IV heads, is this true?
