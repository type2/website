Hi Volks,

&gt; I second this option.  MUCH less destructive!

&gt; Funny how we cringe at the thought of yahoos lowering their busses or
&gt; chopping new holes in the roof, but we seem to advocate the wholesale
&gt; slaughter of irreplaceable Westfalia cabinetry.

Besides, millions of Panel Vans of all kinds and makes
running around in daily heavy city traffic with their
right sides unharmed might be able to tell you something.

I agree a window in the sliding door would be a nice
thing to have, especially for backing out of diagonal 
parking spaces*), but I never found myself wishing for 
another one behind it.

*) I help myself by opening the sliding door, backing 
out, and closing it again before driving off.  Yes,
it is a non-walkthrough.  :-)

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik.
