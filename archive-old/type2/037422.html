&gt; I'll be repainting one day, so I'll have the windows and interior out,

it's
&gt; out?  It looks like it was hit w/ a stone (round mark smaller than a
penny,
&gt; but the impact didn't cause the mini-crater on the inside of the
windshield
&gt; that is typical of a hit like this).
&gt; If it seems wise to replace it, I was thinking of replacing it w/ a tinted
&gt; windshield.  But does it make more sense to just keep the original,
&gt; imperfect one?  Thanks for any and all opinions.

I'm facing the same decision.  I think it depends on how bad the windshield
is and whether it's a VW original.  Mine is and I'll keep it even though
there is a haze around the perimeter from age.  Remember, it really can be
replaced another time if necessary without too much fanfare.  As to the
tinted option, I've heard that because of the high driving position in our
buses, You would be looking right at the tinted border if you are fairly
tall.
