Subject: Re: [T2] Steering Damper

&gt;&gt;What should I 
specifically use for hardware to bolt this in when it arrives?&lt;&lt;

i would suggest going to a junk yard, finding the necessary hardware
(2 bolts i think). then re-use them if they look ok, or go to
the hardware store &amp; match them up.

also a used parts vendor might be able to help. try bustedbus_dot_com.
great service.

i think there is also a bushing that needs to be replaced as well.

good luck,
