Subject: Type4 distributors

The latest issue of Excellence, a good but only 8issues/year Porsche
magazine, has a good technical article about type 4 distributors, complete
with parts explosion and which Bosch serial number goes on which engine.
December issue, with the new Boxer on the front, is the one.
