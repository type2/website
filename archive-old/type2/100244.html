Subject: Replaced heads, loose pushrod tubes

Hey everybody, as always thanks in advance for any advice/opionions.

OK, still in the middle of my head replacing job (1600 SP).

When i put the heads on the pushrod tubes were loose most of them, I thought 
they would seal up when I torqued the head but they didn't.  I thought that 
i had the head on snug but am wondering if maybe they were not flush against 
the cylinders or something.

The pushrod tubes match the old ones so i'm pretty sure they are right.

Thanks,
Daniel
