Subject: loss of power and my frustration with the fort meade community

ok- so tonight i decided after dinner to take a trip across post to roam the 
PX and kill time, i get about 3/4 of the way there when i start to loose 
power..i manage to kick start it by down shifting and dumping the clutch (by 
this time i had slowed sufficiently) and while she sputtered and backfired, 
she never really recovered...i finally coast to a side street...put my 
flashers on and try to figure out the problem...i open the rear hatch and 
watch as people swerve around me (there wasnt much of a shoulder) and gawk

&lt;rant mode on&gt; and one asshole even stopped next to me and had the nerve to 
ask me where the post high school was...as if it were perfectly normal for 
someone to stop in middle of the road, turn on his emergencys, pop the rear 
hatch and start monkeying with the engine &lt;rant mode off&gt; sorry about that, 
but it seemed awfully rude, to say the least...im still fuming over 
this...he didnt even acknowlege that i might have a problem a little more 
serious than a lost school....

so i tried pulling on the throttle arm of the carb but i couldnt hear the 
accelerator pump squirting so i popped the line off that goes from the fuel 
pump to the carb, disconnected the coil, and cranked the engine awhile...no 
fuel came out...i put a bag over the pump to make sure it wasnt just 
squirting to somewhere i couldnt see, cranked again, but still no fuel....

i put about 6 gallons in the tank (stolen from my ghia...the gas was a 
couple months old) but i hadnt drivent it far enough to burn off 6 gallons 
(i can account for mebbe 80 miles of travel)...even if i was running really 
rich, i dont think i could burn off that much fuel that fast...even if i was 
carrying a spare engine and tranny (im basing my fuel consumption figures on 
the rough consumption from PA to baltimore)

so whaddaya think? could it be the fuel pump went bad? blockage in the fuel 
line? ...???

any help would be appreciated...im gonna hike across post to see what i can 
do tomorrow...

oh, finally, someone, a retired marine, stopped to see if i needed any help, 
and towed me to the PX parkking lot, and then gave me a ride back to the 
barracks. mebbe there are decent people left on this post after all...

:)
i hope everyone else had a happy tuesday!
