&gt; Subject: 78 champagne
&gt;
&gt; All this talk about paint jobs.....
&gt;
&gt; I got a quote on my 78 Champagen edition this weekend and am thinking
&gt; seriously about doing it.  The quote is from a local guy who has painted
&gt; about half the cars that are in the local club.
&gt;
&gt; The only problem he has though, are the 3 stripes around the bottom of the
&gt; bus.  He says that finding some that are as wide(about 2&quot;) as what the
&gt; stock ones are is going to be difficult.

I have a friend here in San Jose that had a partial set of those stripes available
awhile back.  Let me know if you're interested and I'll check to see if he still
has them.
