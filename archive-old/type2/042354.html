&gt; You need to set these to the spec'd torque... mondo important.

Sorry, George, but I am very much with Sue on this one.  There are a lot
of nuts and bolts on a VW with a torque spec of &quot;moderate hork&quot; and a
couple with a torque spec of &quot;mondo hork&quot; (big rear axle nut), but there
are also many that demand a torque wrench.  Clutch bolts are definitely
among these.  More importantly, *spark plugs* are high on the list of
&quot;bolts&quot; with a very demanding torque spec (first reply that mentions
horking the plugs into an engine with a cast-iron head gets a wet carrot
up side the head!) , and once you have the wrench for them, you ought to
use it for everything else as well :-)

I have a Sears click-style torque wrench and I use it a *lot*.  Never
regretted doing so, either!  Yes, they are pricy (~USD60-70) but compare
it to the effort of pulling a T4 engine *again* to replace the warped
pressure plate ($130 from Bus Depot, last I checked) and it begins to look
cheap.  Comare it to pulling the heads to helicoil a stripped spark plug
hole and it is a pittance.

&gt; 
&gt; You really *do* need to get a torque wrench and do it right... Sears has 
&gt; them, click style (my favorite as more accurate) or pointer kind... not too 
&gt; expensive... definately cheaper than the clutch parts!!!  Also you will find 
&gt; you end up using it for everything (almost) and *know that 1-the parts won't 
&gt; come apart, 2-the bolt holes won't strip, and 3- things that need to be 
&gt; tightened evenly (like disk brake wheel studs, flywheel bolts, etc) will be 
&gt; even.
