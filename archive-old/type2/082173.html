Subject: Pop top Restoration--

To all that have toiled, and have had short term fiberglass pop top
shine retention---

I used this on an old glass boat years ago, a product by the name of
Penetrol----available at most Marine supply houses---

This stuff wipes on with a rag, and the surplus residue, wipes off with
another.

That's it----

The shine on a faded top is excellent, and it will last for a long
time---

I used it on a customer's Winnebago that was all chalked out awhile
back---

Wiped it on--wiped it off--and the gloss lasted for several years,
before it was required again----

Good, easy to use, simple solution, for a common problem, on a
Westfalia---


Later,
