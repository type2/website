Subject: Re: [VB] Remembering Josh Rodgers

Most of it's already been said.

I never got to meet him in person, but passed a few emails when he was
welding up Chad's bus.  My questions and need for encouraging, experienced
words as I started cutting and welding on my pickup were answered with an
excitement that Josh had about busses.

He's still missed.
