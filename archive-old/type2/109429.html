Subject: Re: [T2] anyone know up to what year T1 engine can be used for
  a '70  bus??

A better question is, does the engine have the 3 threaded mounting holes in
the rear of the block for the rear moustache bar? Newer Beetle, and
aftermarket cases, plus 68-71 bus cases have them, it is possible to mickey
mouse an oil pump adapter plate on to a Beetle engine, but expect to lose
all your oil at the worst possible time if you go that route.

1600 single port was up to 70, 71 was one year only 1600 dual port, then
years after that were all type 4 type pancake engines that you can't use.
