I used a set out of a late bug.  All you have to do is rotate the inertia
reel 90 degrees on its bracket, remove the locating pin (it unscrews) and
bolt the belt in place.  The buckles are joined together so you drill out
the rivet and bolt them individually to the bus at the stock locations.

Many VWs and Audis used the same inertia reels.  Your best bet is to get
two passenger side belts from two cars, as the passenger belts are much
less used then the driver's belts  The left and right inertia reels are
the  same, but the brackets are mirror images of each other so you should
get the brackets from the same car.

A little mixing and matching will yield &quot;factory&quot; appearing and
functioning belts for low $$$
