Subject: Re: [T2] svda dizzy


excuse my french, but this advice is bullshit.

It is true that you don't want to exceed 30-32 on a wedge chamber (no semi
hemi) engine UNDER FULL LOAD, but part throttle cruise requires another
10-15 degrees of timing (unless you like losing 4mpg and a hotter running
engine). If you understand how vacuum advance works, it disappears at 1/2
throttle, leaving you with the hose-disconnected timing (Wow, 30-32 degrees,
remember?).

Don't perpetuate the 009 timing settings as being all encompassing,
including vac advance distributors. If you don't believe me, take a stock
1974' or newer car and rev it in the driveway and tell me what timing #s you
come up with, it's not &quot;acceptable for a T-4&quot;, it doesn't matter which
engine it is.

Tell ya' what. I have $1k that says that SVDA will run cooler, and get 3mpg
better mileage, then a 009, if timed as I say to time it. Wanna' put your $
where your mouth is?

&gt; First, Tell James I need that 205T tomorrow and to check his e-mail
&gt; for my contact info.
&gt;
&gt; Second. If that dizzy advances to a total 45 degrees the motor will
&gt; be toast before he makes it halfway to Greensboro tomorrow. A type 4
&gt; dizzy will advance that much but and should but not a type 1
