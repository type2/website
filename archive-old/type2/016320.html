Subject: VW Font

Michael,

I've been there, but I don't have the URL bookmarked.  I remember that it was
located in the UK, if that helps.  Transporter club???  Had screen savers too.
 You might try searching on them.

I'll cc the type 2 list.  Maybe one of the UK members knows where the site is.

&gt; 
&gt; When I had my old computer at my last job I was able to find the 
&gt; origional VW font on the internet,  the font is the one with the 
&gt; single line underneath it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have searched and searched.  and cannot find it,   I have canceld 
&gt; my list membership till I get moved,  so could you post a email 
&gt; online and ask everyone if they have seen the website where you can 
&gt; download the VW font.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Buddah
