Subject: Re: [T2] what dual carbs for a T4 2. liter

&gt;From: &quot;schwarze&quot; &lt;schwarze_at_mail.ev1_dot_net&gt;
&gt;I'd advise against Dells because parts are difficult to come by
&gt;(at least for the DRLAs).
-----------------

Mike,

I'm a big fan of the Dellorto DRLAs.  They run smooth and they are easy to
tune.  I highly recommend them.  I run the 36's on my new 1776 type1 and get
close to 20 mpg.  Vac advance distributor.  I am actually obsessed with
these carbs, I would like to try the 40's next on my bus, and also install a
set of 40 DHLA sidedrafts on a '75 BMW 2002 but I digress. . .

I recently rebuilt those DLRA 36's--CB Performance had all the unusual parts
I needed. (above and beyond the normal rebuild kits).  Eurocarb UK Ltd has
everything for Dellorto carbs but the international post can get pricey (I
had to order some jets for my Dellorto FRD 34 &quot;Baby Dells&quot; that CB didn't
have in stock).  CB hex bar linkage is the way to go.

I also just drove a bus 500 miles with DRLA's on a 2.0L type4 and I am still
very happy with them, also got close to 20 mpg.

Like David says, gauges are key (oil pressure, oil temp, cyl head temp).

happy carburating,
Will A.
