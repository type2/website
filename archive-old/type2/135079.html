Alas, I really looked at the slop between one of my wrist pins ande a 
rod bushing and thought -- well, oil pressure will take care of that. 
It wasn't a lot of slop. It just wasn't that lovely hand-in-glove fit. 
And of course, I worried about that ever after. I really looked at the 
ring gaps in the right places and staggers, and then swapping one of 
the installed (new) pistons and rings to the other side of the engine 
(I can't remember why), meaning that now they faced the pavement. And 
remembering that I should have reinstalled the rings but now, halfway 
between San Diego and Yuma, it was a little too late to worry about 
that.

I doubt that I'm the only person who accumulates these sorts of errors. 
It's probably the case that every error, no matter how minor, shortens 
engine life a little -- but just a little, most of the time. The trick 
is to accumulate as few of them as possible. Or none, but I know that I 
am not capable of none. No errors is reserved for God.

Anyway, that's why I'm in this 
somewhere-between-a-$19.95-caliper-and-a-$228-micrometer place.
