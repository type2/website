(regarding on-the-road CV replacement)
&gt;
&gt; Bring a pre-greased spare CV with you, an 8mm six-point allen and a
&gt; triple-square tool with you.  Also, a jack, a jack stand, good vice-grips
&gt; (JIC), a hammer, and the Sears external C-ring tool.  Oh... maybe a
&gt; puller, tho on a bay probably not. Should take 1/2 hour by the side of the
&gt; road, and you can drive it home.

I've found that a brass (That's BRASS, not steel!) hammer is very useful
in getting CVs off and on the axle.  Remove the snap ring, slide the boot
up onto the axle out of the way, clean out all the grease you can using
paper towels.  Then hold the axle in your lap, pull the outer ring of the
cv outward toward the end of the axle.  Now you can clearly see the inner
hub of the CV, which is the only thing you will hit with the hammer.
Start tapping the inner hub toward the end of the axle.  Work your way
round and round.  The going will be
slow, but you will make progress.  If your Karma is particularly high, the
CV will slip right off the end of the axle!

To put the CV on, get the splines started, then tap round and round on the
hub of the CV (NOT the outer ring!) and work the CV onto the axle.  When
the end of the axle is even with the CV, put a socket that is larger than
the axle over the end and keep tapping until you can put the snap ring on.

The reason for the brass hammer is so that the hammer is softer than the
CV hub, so it won't get dented.

If you have a puller that holds the CV hub while pressing the axle, that's
dandy, but I never seem to be close to one when a CV needs to come off!
