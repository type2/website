Subject: Steering Problem
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I had a bit of excitement on the way to work today. As I was going around a
corner the steering locked into place as I was straighten out. So I push in
the clutch and roll to the side. Trying to free the steering wheel while
sitting in the drivers seat didn't work, so, I get out and in a adrenaline
charged yank while standing outside the bus I freed it up. I managed to get
to work and back home with no more problems. But, there is a small clunk ant
the base of the steering column now. Any ideas?
