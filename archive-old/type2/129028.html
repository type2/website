Subject: 72 PROBLEMS

Hello everyone,

My 72 van started loosing power the other night while driving
down the freeway and backfiring on de-celleration
It ended up stalling at the stop lights and would not start.
When cranking it over there was a low backfiring sound.
I had it towed home, adjusted the valves and it started up.
Now it will not go over 40 mph and the engine is loud.
Can anyone help me out will the possible problems.

Thanks as always,
Darren
