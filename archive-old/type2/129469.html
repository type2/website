Subject: Re: [T2] Which throwout bearing to use?

Re your part numbers for throwout bearing, karl-
The small face bearing supplied by mechanic is 088 141 165c  what is the
C?
The wide one I have as a spare from unknown trans is o-3151-193-041-
looks like the one on the 77 tranny we are putting in. Any clue from
this # what VW called for it?

karl quoth:

One bearing fits all diaphragm bus clutches from 71 to 92. Some have
wide faces, some have
narrow faces. I am
a little confused by Bus Depot listing the 113 151 165A as the bus
bearing. This bearing is for
a type 1 from
71 up. Bus Boys shows this same bearing for the bus also.
VW says it should be a 088 141 165 A from 71 to 79 buses.
OE VDub says 088 141 165 B for buses 71 to 92..... not sure where they
got the B from.
Vanagon part number is 091 141 165 D.

I have 2 different Sachs 228 pressure plates with 2 different size
openings where the fingers
end.
One T.O. bearing fits either one.
