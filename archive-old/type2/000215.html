' 71 Dormobile...but some strange noises in question...

First off....early mornin'....when I release the handbrake and move off I
get a sharp ' detaching' clunk from the brakes.....are my shoes worn?
...do I need to adjust the brakes......or is this normal ???

....also, upon moving off, reaching your terminal velocity in 1st,.....
...I depress the clutch to engange 2nd and....CLUNK.....2nd gear engages.
This can be avoided by changing at lower rev's ....but should I see this as
a problem ??
Thank you to all who play...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
