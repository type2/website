Subject: Re: JCW Engine Stands?

Yeas...I relate to the age thing...I think the days when I could heave a
completely assembled type IV motor around are long gone as well.....

I've been checking into a lot of 'specialist' VW tools and parts etc to
take home to Aus with me (they're so *cheap* here....).

LCW offers the bench mount stand for around $40 and the free-standing for
around $60.  I have the catalog at home and will post firm prices and no.s
this evening.

BUT as far as I can tell Southern California Imports offer the same units
with the price on the bench mount being $18 and the free standing $40 (I
don't know whether delivery costs would overcome this difference?).  I will
post this info tonight too.....



&gt;Now that peer/list pressure made me go public with my age, you can
&gt;understand why I don't want to spend another minute in a damp, chilly
&gt;basement hunched over an engine sitting on cinderblocks!
&gt;
&gt;So few days ago I was happy to see a request for the catalog number of
&gt;the JC Whitney engine stand that bolts to a bench.  But I never saw a
&gt;reply and presume it was handled off the list.
&gt;
&gt;My current (?) &quot;Summer Sale&quot; JCW catalog does not list the
&gt;engine stand either. Actually, I believe they offer two stands, one
&gt;free standing the other bench mounted. I'd be interested in price,
&gt;catalog #, and opinions of each. Maybe other listmembers would be
&gt;interested as well.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Tom F.
