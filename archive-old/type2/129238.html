Subject: Re: [T2] Warning - Schadek oil pump on Vanagon - no go

Thanks, sorry I missed that post.  I now have another pump so I'm done 
with that issue.

If anyone wants a never used, but slightly adjusted Schadek 30mm HD oil 
pump, and a dished Type 1 cover with one corner partially ground off, 
you can have it for $10 plus actual shipping cost.

The adjustment consisted of pressing the drive gear down it's shaft 
about 3 mm - press fit - and grinding off a few mm of shaft that would 
have sat proud of the gear. There's plenty of room for adjustment either 
way, just takes another bit of pressing if it doesn't fit your application.

&gt; Stop.  Take a deep breath.  i posted about this a few months ago.  I have
&gt; done this successfully.  Take the pump cover to a machine shop and have them
&gt; remove the entire lip on the pump cover.  What you end up with is a flat
&gt; piece of steel with the 4 holes for the studs.  Then you put it on and the
&gt; moustache bar fits no problem.
