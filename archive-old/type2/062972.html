Subject: Brake caliper problem resolved!!!

Hi all
I would first like to thank all those who responded to message.
I called the local O'Reily auto parts and they can get
my caliper for $28 with NO core charge. Sounds like a winner
to me. This will give me a chance to take my old calpier apart 
and discover it when I get time. Thanks again.......
