Subject: Re: [T2] Horsepower

Almost 20 percent more HP, tons more torque, the main bearings are larger,
the rods are bigger, the case is stronger, it has a built in oil pump and
full flow oil.

These type 4 style engines will outlast a type 1 engine in a bus 2 or 3 to
1.


&gt; So, they all seem to offer very close HP ratings ..... Am I right? What is
&gt; the big advantage of type 4 engines other than Fuel injection and hydraulic
&gt; lifters? Especially when it seems the cost of parts is like double that of a
&gt; type 1 engine.
