Subject: Re:  Fuel pump autopsy

Sorry to get in late in this post.  What your symptoms when the pump 
failed?  Did it run cold, but not hot?

A few years back my brother fitted an new fuel pump to his '74.  It 
worked fine for a while.  After a few thousand miles, it started 
failing when the engine was hot, but worked fine when the engine was 
cold.  The problem wound up being with the shaft of the pump.  It had 
not been hardened properly (as verified with a hardness test) and it 
wore down, shortening its length.  As the engine heated up and 
expanded, the shaft became too short to operate the pump lever with 
enough motion to sufficient fuel to keep the engine running properly.  
Needless to say, this took some time with a lot of 'blind alleys' to 
identify the problem.  We stuck in an old used OEM VW shaft and the 
pump has worked perfectly ever since.

Something to check if you've replaced this pump in the last few years.
