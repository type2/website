Subject: Pirates of Silicone Valley

Since this is Friday, I thought I would mention that I watched Pirates of Silicone Valley (or is it Silicon?) a couple of nights ago. There isn't a single street or road scene that doesn't have at least one air-cooled Volkswagen in it. Specifically appropriate to this list, there is a scene when they are still in college at Berkley, and the police are searching their Westfalia camper van for drugs and other stuff. They find some &quot;black&quot; boxes or whatever they're called and toss them back into the van. 

Pretty cool. You can buy the movie on VHS or V-CD, but apparently they don't sell it on DVD?
