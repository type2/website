Subject: Re: [T2] Electric winch for pulling T2's

&gt; 	We've picked up an enclosed car hauler that is tall enough for T2's

&gt; in most cases, I am having an electric winch installed in the front of it.
&gt; My question is, do I need a 6000# winch to pull a bus onto a car hauler or
&gt; can I go with something smaller?  The ramp is 6' long and the slope of the
&gt; ramp is not bad at all.  I'm just wondering if I can go with something
&gt; smaller since I'm not trying to lift a bus completely off the ground, but
&gt; just pull it on the trailer rather.

in a pinch I pulled mine onto a trailer with a 1000lb hand winch....not
gonna say for sure I may have just been lucky but I sure would trust that
much (but not enough to get under it)

YMMV
