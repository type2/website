Subject: [T2] Cleaning Westy Cushions

    I'm always amazed at how well this fabric cleans up. I just stripped the 
covers off my '77, the one over the engine hatch and the fold out bed, tossed 
them in the washer, and they came out looking great. Mine has the 
orange/green plaid, and the colors are a lot brighter. The rear bed cushion 
had a big stain on it, looked like a quart of oil was spilled on it, but that 
came clean as well. Getting the covers off the fold out bed is a pain, about 
100 or so staples to pull out on each cushion, and even more of a pain to 
staple back on. A heavy duty staple gun will do the trick, but an electric 
staple gun would probably make the job easier. The foam will have to replaced 
as well, as the bottom cushion crumbled when I took the cover off. If you do 
this, get the high density foam-on my last Westy I used the cheap stuff, and 
it was like sitting on a board. All this should make the interior smell a lot 
better as well! I've always just tossed the covers in the washing machine, 
run it on gentle cycle, then let them air dry. The results are worth the 
effort.    Jeff S.
