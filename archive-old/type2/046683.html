&gt;  Why would that little spring snap??

I guess old age. Get another identical one. It will probably last 30 years
too. Depending on your age that may be a 'lifetime' :-)

I also had the spring brake on me but with less tragic results. Keeping my
foot under the pedal was all that was required to keep the engine from
'running wild'.
