X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

VW made a transaxle just like you are looking for, called a Syncro. They
used them in the Vanagon Syncros. These Vanagons are hard to find and parts
even harder, but they are out there. The price reflects the rarity of the
Van. However, if you want to make an all-wheel-drive VW, this would be the
easiest place to start, with a used, possibly wrecked Vanagon Syncro. They
had an output for the driveshaft to the front and a differential in front.
The trans is a lot like the 091, but I do not think they share many parts,
mounting may be the same though. It may cost a lot for Syncro parts, but a
lot cheaper than having someone custom make parts for a regular trans. Put
out lots of feelers and you may get lucky with a Syncro that has what you
need, but the rest is trashed. The Vanagon list will be very helpful in
locating a donor or parts for such a project. Please note, I do not suggest
that you gut out a good Syncro for its drivetrain, these are to hard to
find, try to locate a damaged one.

Subject: [T2] Bay 4wd prototypes, rambling, long too


This probably should be a Friday question, but I was unable to post last 
Friday and I'm not patient enough to wait 'till next Friday, and there is
Bus 
content, so here goes.
I have a book called &quot;Automuseum Wolfsburg&quot; that is a guide to the VW
factory 
museum.  In it there is a late bay bus 4WD prototype.  It says that it was a

forerunner of the Synchros.  Neat to look at. 
Now, is there anyway that anyone can think of that a VW transaxle, either
bug 
or bus, can be tapped to provide an output for a driveshaft to go to the 
front of the vehicle to provide an auxiliary drive for the front wheels?  It

was done for the Schwimmwagen, but I've never seen one of those close up to 
see how it was done.
I want to build an amphibious vehicle (not out of my Westy or Doublecab!)
and 
with my sincere VW leanings I would love to use VW parts for it. The only 
drawback that I can see to using VW parts is the lack of front wheel (4 
wheel) drive to pull it out of the pond, lake, or whatever after a swim.
VW did it, so I assume that it is at least possible to get an auxiliary 
output from the transaxle.  I don't think that it will be easy.
If anyone could shed some light on this, or has tried it, or would like to 
discuss it, or whatever, please drop me an email.  (Can a Subaru ring and 
pinion be flipped so that a VW  motor could adapted to it and be rear
mounted 
with the Subaru 4WD system used??)
If anyone has a Schwimmer (or Amphicar) anywhere near Wheeling, WV and would

be willing to let me take a peek at it, please email me as well.
Lastly, and bus content, there was a white doublecab 'boat' pictured on the 
last page of VW Trends magazine sometime in the last year or so that had
been 
converted to a boat.  Does anyone know anything more about that?
Sorry for the long ramblings, but there is a very diverse and helpful group 
on this list, and it's quite a resource to be able to pick your brains.
Thanks
