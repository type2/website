When I drove/towed my '63 home and after I stripped the glass, rubber,
seats, interior, soda blasted the thing down to bare steel, chopped out and
ground down the rust, welded in the new steel and epoxy primed it, a guy who
does car restorations came over and told me I had at least 2 more years of
work to do. Outraged I went to work. There was no way I told myself.

Well, it has been 6 months of hammering out dents, more welding, more
grinding, removing bondo, applying thin layers of bondo, re-epoxy priming,
filler priming and spraying the &quot;first colors&quot;.  I got it started and drove
it out into the sun only to see the massive amounts of body work still
needed for anything close to a &quot;showroom&quot; look.

Then I got pissed off about not being able to easily and quickly start the
thing so I could move it in and out of the shop, so I bought a new 6V
starter. It didn't work. I took down the case stamp and found out I had a
'74 engine, which is 12V, so now I needed to convert to 12V. Well, I'll just
say that at every move I have found that the previous owner must have had a
bad LSD habit. Why he would load up a 12V motor with 6V parts is beyond the
understanding of anyone. He also, apparently, used any part that he had at
hand, and just left off some parts completely. I am spending alot of time at
the parts house with a small crowd looking at a part and scratching their
heads. They have never seen some of these.

I am only wanting this engine to drive in and out of the shop, I will
eventually put in a new engine and trans, but am not wanting to do that
until I finish the body work. Therefore, the added frustration of having to
do all this work to simply have a starting motor is driving me nuts.

I would have murdered any other vehicle. Only my love for this bus has saved
it from a big fire or a push off a cliff.

So, welcome to the world of the VW bus.
