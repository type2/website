Subject: FS: Mitutoyo Digital Micrometer Set

Hi folks,

Building a motor?  Need to check journal and piston sizes? Have I got a 
deal for you... (and I need to make the mortgage,)

I have three Mitutoyo digital micrometers left over from my aerospace 
quality assurance days.

Model No:         Range

293-722         1-2&quot;  25.4-50.8mm
293-723         2-3&quot;  50.8-76.2mm
293-724         3-4&quot;  76.2-101.6mm

These are each LCD digital mics that resolve to 0.00005&quot;/.001mm and read 
in both imperial and metric units. Mitutoyo says the first two are 
accurate to their resolution and the large one is accurate to 0.0001&quot; 
They aren't new, but they were new when I got them and I'll bet I 
haven't used them a half dozen times. They've just been sitting in the 
cork lined toolbox drawer for fifteen years. There's literally, not a 
mark on them. Carbide anvils, ratcheting thimbles, top-of-the-line 
stuff. You can find the details at Mitutoyo's website. Just search the 
Model Number.

The current retail cost of the three of them is $691, discount houses 
get over $650 for them.  I'd like to see them go to a good home, so if 
you're setting up to do motors or if you want to upgrade to new 
equipment, now's your chance to save a bunch of bucks. I could flog them 
on epay and easily get $400 for 'em.  Does someone want/need them bad 
enough to give me $350 + postage for the set? If not, make me an offer I 
can't refuse... Mortgage is due the fifteenth.

Jim
