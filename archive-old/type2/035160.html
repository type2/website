Subject: Rebuild Questions?

Hey folks,  I'm in the process of tearing down a 1700 pancake engine that has 
been abused by the PO owner and have some questions for the list. The engine 
has been converted to a single progressive carb and is missing lots of 
cooling tin and the thermostat had been disconnected.  Also did not have any 
vacuum hoses on the dissy.  I don't know how long the PO ran it like that but 
it was running when I started to tear it down.  Could not tune it like it was 
so I decided to tear it down and inspect.

My heads have the EGR holes in them and I would like to seal them up 
permanently any suggestions other than welding?

I broke one of the fan blades off trying to get the bolts loose on the fan, 
how much will the missing blade throw off the balance of the fan,  does it 
have to be fixed?

One of the exhaust valves is brown instead of grayish black what does this 
mean?
This same valve was sucking in air through a loose EGR connection in the head.

My brake servo is not connected to any vacuum how much loss of braking does 
this cause?

Thanks for any advice you can give,
