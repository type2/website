Subject: dizzy up the bus

Thanks for the suggestions.  This afternoon I took off the right side valve
cover and turned the engine over until the timing mark was at the top of the
crank pulley and the valves for #1 were closed, checked the rotor and it was
pointing at the firing position for #3.  I yanked that puppy right outta
there and lined it up correctly with the notch, put it back in, connected
everything and cranked her up.  Re-adjusted dwell, re-adjusted idle,
re-adjusted timing and the old girl is idling like a purring kitten.
FYI...when you completely block off that little vacuum hose that runs from
the air intake to the vacuum biscuit....the engine won't start.  At all.  My
vacuum hoses are looking pretty worn so maybe it's time to think about
replacing them.  Anybody got a good source?

Again...thanks,

Ben Beasley
