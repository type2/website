Subject: jet sizes, plug for brazilian solex
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

You can tell by pulling the jet which is located behind the plug that drains
the fuel bowl. Take the carb off (come on, it takes 10 minutes) drain the
fuel bowl, stick a long, regular blade screwdriver in the hole and the main
jet will come right out. It says right on the jet what size it is.

And here I would like to put in a plug for the &quot;cheap, sh$tty Brazilian Pict
34-3&quot; carbs.

I have been rebuilding PICT 34s for about three years now. And I have yet to
rebuild one that runs worth a damn when I'm done. I soak them in carb
cleaner, blow out every passage with compressed air, carefully reassemble
them using a rebuild kit, and they invariably run like crap. They don't
idle, you can't adjust them, and they get 13 mpg. Crap.

So I finally broke down and bought one of the Brazilian (or is it Mexican? I
forget) Solex carbs, and friends, I'm a believer. NEVER has my bus run
smoother, NEVER has it idled more evenly, NEVER have I had a carb that
actually responds to adjustments. People poo-poo these carbs because they
aren't German. Well I'm here to tell you that given the alternative (a
crappy running, worn out German Solex) spend the $130 and get a new
Brazilian (or is it Mexican?) Solex. You will be happy you did.

Full disclosure: I own VW of Brazil :)
