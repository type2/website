Subject: Re: [T2] 80-83 Aircooled West- Fuel Tank overflow




&gt;I've been avoiding this but here goes.
&gt;What is the cure for the fuel tank overflowing out the filler pipe when
&gt;you get about six gallons in the tank?

I found that the pump usually has two or three settings so you don't have to 
hold it. If I put it on the fastest one, gas will spew out sometime during 
the filling. So I set it to a slower pump rate and I never spill a drop. I 
usually use the slowest setting, it gives you more time to wash the windows 
and check the tires.
