Subject: Power loss after fitting new mechanical fuel pump

After discover a leak on my old pump, I gave in and fitted a new 
braziliam fuel pump (1600DP, carburettor, mechanical pump, 
generator/dynamo). Things sounded great at idle/on the level, but at 
speed or uphill suddenly have power loss, which feels very like running 
out of fuel. I have noticed two things. First, the pump does not look 
like the picture on the box - the outlet nozzle is vertical, rather than 
horizontal. Second, most suppliers recommend buying a new push rod at 
the same time as a new pump. After browsing archives, I am convinced I 
have the wrong pump (looks like the right one for an earlier engine), 
but can't find an answer to why it is best to but a new rod to go with 
the pump? Whilst I wait for the proper pump to arrive, can anyone shed 
any light on my problem?

Incidentally, I checked the timing and valve clearances after fitting 
the pump. didn't mess with the carburettor as the idle seemed OK, and I 
could not imagine how changing the pump could mess the carb up. Was I wrong?
