&gt; Does anyone know of a WOODEN steering wheel that is available to fit

&gt; I have one in my second car and, as I like the feel of it so much, I
&gt; wondered if there was an option for the bus

I don't know of any &quot;stock&quot; wooden wheels for a bus, but I have seen
aftermarket wheels from places like Boyds, and others in the larger
diameter to fit a bus. You would have to get an adapter, or have one
made if none are availible. Does anyone know if they make an adapter
for the Bus?
