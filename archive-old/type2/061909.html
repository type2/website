Subject: Re: California Permits

Hey

Have you considered maybe getting your permit in Canada - maybe you could get it
registered, licensed, and insured in canada then just take the plates to
California when you go - im not sure if it is possible but as long as you have the
VIN and receipt - you should be ok

Just a thought
