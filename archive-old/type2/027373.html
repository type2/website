the engine was drained before i removed it.  but then again before that i 
was litterally leaking 1 quart of oil per 100 miles, maybe 80mi.  anyway, it 
was leaking oil from just about every gasket and seal on the thing.  I am 
just hoping that I replace enough in the rebuild to stop the leaks.  the 
other option is to buy a rebuilt and just replace it... this is my first 
rebuild and i am not to confident that I am going to fix everything the 
first time around.  I guess thats how to learn.
sounds like I'll clean the heat exchangers and pipes out, thanks for the 
advice.

&gt;was the motor taken out with the case full of oil and tipped to the
&gt;side? Oil could run past the rings into the heads and past open
&gt;valves into the exhaust and heater boxes. Let hope!
&gt;&gt;I don't know I took the whole exhaust system/heat exchangers as one
&gt;&gt;unit and set it up against the wall in my garage.  now there is a
&gt;&gt;pool of oil in my garage.  I will investigate where it came from
&gt;&gt;tonight when i go home.  wait, how do i find out were it really is.
&gt;&gt;I think it is in both the pipes and the box.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;adam
&gt;&gt;&gt;is the oil in the pipes or in the box? f in the box you likely have a
&gt;&gt;&gt;leaky fn seal.
