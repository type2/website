Subject: Re: Coleman Plat Cat heater report--HEADACHE when used

Catalytic heaters rely on a ready oxygen supply to function, and if you
run them in an enclosed space they will use up the available oxygen.  

In a low-oxygen atmosphere, they will either shut down (hopefully) or
start producing carbon monoxide due to incomplete combustion.  One
symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning is a headache.

A garage is usually leaky enough to provide ample oxygen, but a bus is
a well-sealed box.  Don't operate a cat heater in a bus unless you
provide some positive method of ventalation!
