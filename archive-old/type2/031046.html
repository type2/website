OK from my Fuel Injection trouble shooting manual.

&gt;    I spent the later part of this muggy afternoon looking over all i could, 
&gt; taking all of your suggestions into consideration. still cant get the bus 
&gt; started and its four days to set departure day. Looks as if there is gonna be 
&gt; a lil' bit of a delay. Don and i ran all the tasts that we could to figure it 
&gt; out, and he suspects the ECU. Here's what we did in a nutshell:

I don't suspect the ECU (yet)

&gt;   We had good spark at the coil and all cylinders, we had good fuel pressure. 

how much presure, the ring needs 35psi to operate the injectors properly

&gt; The plugs were next to pull and they were dry as a bone. We used a spray 

This says there is no fuel being injected,  this will happen if

. insufficient fuel presure  (35psi in the ring)
. clogged injector (but unlikely all 4 at the same time)
. no signal to injector
. clogged fuel filter

if you have low presure check to see if your fuel pump is running.  should
be able to hear it, it is behind the drivers rear wheel on the frame.


remove an injector (take the trigger wire off the coil so there is no
spark) put a container in front of it, run the starter, fuel should be
injected into the container, it should come out as a fine cone shaped
spray

if no spray check
. wires reversed on fuel pump
. presure regulator defective
. wire or hoses to fuel pump reversed
. is fuel pump defective
. check that double relay is operating
  to check double relay
   .  connect test light to terminal 88y and 85 you should get current
     no light means break in wire between 88y and battery
   .  if light then check between 86a &amp; 85, operate starter, you should
     NOT get current.  if current, replace double relay
   . if no current check for breaks in the wire between terminal 50 on
starter and 86a on relay


&gt; have a multi tester, so we did what we could with a test light. What we did 
&gt; was arc the tester from the positive contact to the negative ground of the 
&gt; injector wires. I hypothesised that the light should come on with all twelve 
&gt; volts as the engine was cranked, but it only generated a slight pulsatiing 
&gt; glow.

nope, you got the correct reading, a slight pulsating glow,

Next step in the trouble shooting chart,
Disconect wire from temperature sensor, connect ohmmeter,  resistance
should be approx 2.5k ohms between the lead and ground.


&gt; As the same thing was done to the cold start valve, the glow was much 
&gt; more intense for the first half second, but then cut back to a light glow 

sounds about right, although usually more than 1/2 second but not much

&gt; on a fully operating system. Don suspected that the valve wasnt operating 
&gt; properly, so we deposited some gasoline into the air distributer through the 
&gt; intake hose. This did absolutely nothing, and i was left in a state of 
&gt; dumb-dum. 

hmmm, are your valves operating.

hydralic valves are set different than solid valves, go to top dead center
of each cyl just like solid lifters, then tighten them until there is
solid contact, then take 1 more turn tighter (some manuals say 2 turns,
both will work) then lock your valves down,  Muir I don't believe has this
correct.

&gt;    I plan on bringing a multi tester over to check out some readings tomorow, 
&gt; but dont have the Bently's or Haynes' manual. I dont think that it would be 
&gt; possible to to acuire either of these by my deadline. So i'm gonna have to go 
&gt; with any clues Muir may drop. I also just had an idea! My friend has a 78 FI 
&gt; engine that is (barely) running. If i were to take readings from his, and 
&gt; compare to mine, i may be able to find some incompattible sequences. However, 
&gt; this is the friend that was inquiring about a new wiring harness. 
&gt; Thanks again for the advice, and any that may come.
&gt; Any suggestions of stuff that i may have overlooked is greatly appreciated...


OK then, 

1st  check your valves
2nd  check your fuel presure and deliver
3rd  check your injector operation
4th  check your double relay.

27th, replace ECU

Good Luck
Bob
