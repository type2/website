John, the south winds are really easy to work on and put together from just
parts and pieces.  Check each piece out per the manual before you assemble
it.  If you find a couple parts heaters, and you can mix the 6 and 12 volt
sheet metal parts together with the exception of the motors, actuator
solienod (in the metal cup on the end of the burner) and the coil.  I bet
you could put a working one together.  Parts heaters are easier to find and
much cheaper, plus you will know it has freshly checked parts in it.  I have
all the rebuild parts and manuals at:

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; I am looking for a 6 volt Southwind\Stewart warner gas heater (12 volt could
&gt; also work).  Can be from a bug or bus, doesn't matter, but preferably it would
&gt; be complete &amp; working.  I have a TON of stuff to trade including an
&gt; Eberspacher early BN4 (although it has a dead coil, it still has all other
&gt; parts including glow\spark plugs and fuel pump), as well as ANYTHING you would
&gt; need (except seats and interior panels) from a '66 kombi, including an entire
&gt; 1500 engine. Or I can buy outright for cash, but I prefer to trade. Anyone
&gt; wanna do some bartering?
&gt; 
&gt;
