I just took a look at Chad's chart at http://www.instability_dot_com/vw/aero.html. I guess this works nicely theoretically, but from my experience buses can go faster than 70 mph.
I just returned from a 1000 mile Thanksgiving trip with my 79 Camper. Cruising speed was 75-80 mph, at times 85 miles (according to speedometer with 185R14C tires). I know that the speedometer always reads a bit more than what you are actually doing, but my engine has approx. 150k miles on it, feels pretty tired, and had an exhaust leak during this trip. My point is that a stock camper with a healthy engine should be able to do more than just 70 real mph.
Back in Germany I have a 74 Camper with an engine that puts out approx 110 hp at the flywheel (2L, Porsche P&amp;C, large valves, 296 cam, dual 38mm Solex). I had this camper up to 160 km/h (approx. 100 mph), again stock (but pretty accurate) speedo with 184R14C. According to the chart more than 140 rear wheel hp would be needed for that, and even 90 mph would still require 120 hp at the wheels.
I don't know where these discrepancies come from, but our buses are not as under-powered as we tend to believe.
