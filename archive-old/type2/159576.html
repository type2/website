Subject: Re: [T2] Nominal battery voltage

A single lead acid &quot;cell&quot; generates 1.2v across it's terminals.  There's 
12 cells in a car battery, so the voltage should be 12.6v when fully 
charged.  Charging should bring it to around 13-14v. 

Despite what most people think, when a battery hits 10v, it's pretty 
much dead-flat.  Running a battery down below 10v causes the elements to 
sulphate, reducing both it's life and the amount of charge it can hold.  

Put a trickle charger on the battery for a day, and let it charge.  Then 
take off the charger, run the headlights for about 5 minutes (to pull 
off any surface charge), and see what the voltage is.  If it's below 
12v, you need a new battery.  Others may say you can keep using a 
battery that &quot;rests&quot; below 12v, but that indicates a weak cell, and a 
dying battery.  Better not to be stranded.

IIRC, the ECU in busses needs at least 10V.  With one dead cell in a 
battery, that drops the voltage to 11.4v (about).  With the load of the 
starter turning the engine over, the voltage sags more and the ECU may 
not see it's required 10v.  So it won't start.  

So try the above charging/testing routine and see if it helps.  If not, 
pony up the cash and put in a good battery.  

Hope it helps!

&gt; I've heard that auto batteries don't necessarily read exactly 12V due  
&gt; to the details of construction in the individual cells. What would be  
&gt; considered normal for an FI system? I measured my battery today using  
&gt; a DMM with the probes directly on the battery terminals and only saw  
&gt; 10.6 V. (I've also been troubleshooting other electrical problems in  
&gt; the last two months and never saw any static voltage over 11.)
&gt;
&gt; Would anyone see this as a problem? time to get a new battery? Would  
&gt; it cause any of the FI components to not work?

&gt; Thank you,
