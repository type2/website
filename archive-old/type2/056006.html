Subject: 200k possible?

I'm only the second owner of a 1976 Campmobile which just rolled over to 170,000 miles on the original engine.

Seems to still be running fine, but should a person look for a new engine before this one goes or run it until it drops?  Has anyone heard of original engines lasting 200k and more?
