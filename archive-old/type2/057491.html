Subject: Re: title waves...

I seem to remember a thread a few months back...

Someone said that if you carry a title-less car to AL, the local DMV will
set you up with a new title lickety-split(well, a few weeks or so).  I'd
check into this, or maybe a closer state to you that also has this policy.

Might pay off in the long run!
