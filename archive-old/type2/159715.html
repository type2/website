Subject: alternator options for my 78 westy

Hey Everyone,
So, I've been having trouble with my voltage.  It likes to hang out 
around 13.2 and I've changed out my voltage regulator and put in a new 
battery and it's still low.  So, now I'm thinking of changing out my 
alternator.  It's old anyways so I look at it as preventative maintenance.

What are my options?  I'd like to get a high-output alternator if 
possible because I also have a pretty loud stereo and that seems to draw 
a lot of current.  I'm also going to put in a battery isolator to keep 
my extra battery charged so I want to make sure I have enough power to 
keep everything running smoothly.

I was looking at Bus Depot and they have a high output alternator, but 
it says this: &quot;For models factory-equipped with high-output alternator.&quot; 
  Does that mean that it's a different mounting?  Also, what output is 
the stock alternator, and what output is the high output alternator?

Thanks!
Mike
