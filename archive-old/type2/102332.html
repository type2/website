Subject: removing &quot;extra&quot; bits?

While setting my valves, etc., I couldn't help but notice (ouch!) a few 
bits and pieces that me and my 1976 2Ltr. bus might be able to do without.

Dirt-catching things seemingly related to cabin heating, which we don't 
need in the tropics. Sheet metal plates and ducts at either side of the 
engine, plastic box with small fan and hoses next to the air filter, flex 
hose under the chassis, cable for little doors, etc.

Can some of this stuff go, in the interest of keeping things clean and 
tidy? Anything need to be plugged afterward?

Peter Nielsen
