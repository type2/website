Subject: Re: [T2] 78 engine / 091 tranny -&gt; 72?

Hi Paul,

My westfakia has a 2L engine hooked up to a 73 3-rib transmission...  
It bolts up fine as long as you change the engine to a 210mm or 215mm  
clutch and flywheel and use the 3-rib tranny's starter. IIRC you  
might also need longer studs in the engine to get through the deeper  
bosses of the 3-rib bell housing. No rocket science required.

On hills the 2L gives you HP that isn't lost to the higher ratios of  
the 6-rib transmission. It potentially sacrifices 5% in fuel economy  
and top speed when compared to the 091 tranny, but it has worked  
great for me when pulling a trailer and fully loaded for the trips to  
EveryBus and John Brown's Buses. Top speed hasn't been a problem for  
me, I rarely need to go faster than 80MPH, and the 3-rib will easily  
get there on flat land.

One thing you haven't mentioned is how you're feeding that engine...  
I think putting FI into a 72 would be a nightmare without the access  
hatch above the motor. But if you're swapping in the carbs from the  
1700 then you're going to want to move up to 137 main jets and you  
will also need to add an electric fuel pump, preferably with a cut- 
out relay to shut it off in case of accident. Neither of these  
options are impossible, they're just something extra to be considered  
as part of the process to get you where you want to go.


Happy trails,
