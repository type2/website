&gt; no you cannot just drop solid lifters in, there are different cam

In a type4 engine the solid lifters can be just dripped in as well.
It's the type1 engine that requires splitting the case to remove the
lifters. But even though many people have moved to hyd from solid and
not changed the cam I still feel it's a bad idea to mix/match metals
that have been work hardened to match.
