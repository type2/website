Subject: R: [T2] R: [T2] Temp Gauge

Well, I think it's cool enough if I have my Oil Temp in 0F other than
Celsius... in this list everybody talks Farenheit anyway!!!

As for the head temp the same, for the RPMs it just doesn't apply, no?

I'm waiting for bus depot now.

The VDO gauges are available in metric. My '84 VW Rabbit (Golf) had them.

By the way you can install them in three 2&quot; holes between the radio and
ashtray.

Measure 4 or 5 times!!!

VERY stock looking.

I even removed the glass fronts and painted the needles white to match the
speedo.
