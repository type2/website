&gt; wanted to see what the other bussers thought before purchasing and installing engine.
&gt;
&gt; it is a bent and berkley or something not a Viton.seal like at bus depot...

Bus depot has expidited shipping, you can get it overnight if your willing
to pay the shipping,  a seal should be cheap, I just ordered a starter
motor expidited, now you don't wanna know what shipping is on that heavy
thing.....

when it's your daily driver you do what you gotta do.
