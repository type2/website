 Stephen, that ring pops off....

well...even after all that trouble yesterday....it did abso-funking-lutely
nothing.  Not a thing.  Hours and hours of work for nothing....and I STILL
don't know what the problem is.
It seems as if the cable isn't being pulled far enough to disengage the
clutch....but I went through the pedal assembly and there is nothing wrong with
it.

Now I'm thinking gland nut ...I didn't think that the bearings in there would
grab that hard though.  maybe I can find it somewhere else
today....hopefully...because I don't want to pull the motor again and I REALLY
don't want to replace a gland nut.

anything that I'm missing???
I've been through the clutch, pressure plate (the correct one), the T/O
bearing, the clutch fork (welds are fine and its not bent), new cable, new
bowden tube, wingnut is fine and not stripped, and the pedal assembly seems
just a-OK.



&gt; The newer style pressure plate takes a
&gt; throwout bearing without a ring on it and the old style pressure plate
&gt; takes a throwout bearing with a ring...
