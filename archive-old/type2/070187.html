Hi Bus fans,
Y'know there's no excuse for getting stuff in the fan like that and not
knowing it...  I had a small piece of electrical tape in there and that
was enough to make the engine (1600) vibrate like it was running on
3 cylinders!  If your engine starts that, check around back for a leaf
or something.  It will save you a valve job, or worse, a crankshaft.
