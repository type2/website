Subject: Testing Thermo Time Switch 

Volks: Well I'm getting ready to reassemble my scorched bus.
      I'm trying to test the various parts on the bench before I 
    re-assemble it. I've go two cold start valves, both of which
   click, and pass air when I apply 12V.
  Now I'm trying to test teh thermo time switch which controls it, and
 am having trouble.
My understanding is that the thrmo time switch is in series
with the cold start valve, and controls it. If the engine is cold, then 
the Thermo time switch should allow power to flow through the cold start valve,
for about 10 seconds, and then intrupt the power shutting the cold start valve.
If the engine is warm, it is an open circiut, and the cold strt valve doesn't
get opened.
However, the gizmo I think is the thermo time switch has about 20ohms 
of resistance, and if I hook it up in series with the Cold start valve, there 
is not enough current flow to open the cold start valve. Also, the resistance
of the thermo time switch does not change after 10, or even 60 seconds.
I tried cooling them off in the freezer, and even with frost growing on them
they seem to have a constant 20 ohms. What I believe to be the thermo time
switch is a 3/8&quot; diameter by about 2&quot; long rod thingy on a bracket that looks
like a water temperature sensor, or a small water heating element that was
mounted below the air distributor above teh block just left of teh centerline
of teh engine. Is this the thermo time switch?

If this is indeed the thermo time switch, what's going on? Am I wrong about
how this works?  How could I test it? Does it actually control a relay, or 
something in the brain box?
If this isn't the thermo time switch, what is it, and what does the thermo time 
switch look like? 
Note: I've got two of these things. One came off the burn victim, the other
came with a box of parts I bought. Both act (or refuse to act?) in the same way?

I'm also trying to rebiuld my wiring harness, any idea where I can get
some of the connectors? I need the five pin that goes on teh throttle switch, 
a six pin for the air flow sensor, adn 3 two pins for the cold start switch, 
aux air reg, and thermo time switch.

Thanks for any help
