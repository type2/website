Subject: Re: [T2] Yet another Roadtrip!

W.A.S.T.E in NJ quoth:
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, when Renault brought out the R-10, they ran full-
&gt;paged ads calling it, &quot;The Renault for people who swore
&gt;they would never buy another one&quot;...

	The geopolitics are outlined in The
Romance of Renault and in J Dewar McClintock's
independent history.
	VW sales surged in N. Amer. far beyond
any previous Eurocar.  Very skillful ads in Life,
etc, pushed quality &amp; economy.  Regie Renault
achieved low-60s mph  -  with the poorly
water-cooled 850cc Dauphine.  The VW 1200 Beetle
of that period could cruise for many h flat-out,
so detuned was this 36 bhp SAE motor (30 bhp DIN
i.e with generator and a few other 'accessories'
connected).  The corresponding Splittie microbus
like my '57, geared down 1.4:1 by the gearcases
which also gave larger groundclearance, would
cruise at 63 mph pretty comfortably  -  max &amp;
cruising speed.
	Froggis bought up 6 Liberty ships,
cranked up a comparable advertising campaign in
e.g  Natl Geog, pusing the Dauphine - similar top
speed to the Beetle's, but Froggis had failed to
foresee the unutterably crude driving of
Norteamericanos on long straight highways  -
floor it, hours on end.  A well maintained VW
could do it; the 850 Dauphine could not.  Con
rods emerged etc.  63,000 Dauphines were left on
sales lots &amp; wharves, grass growing up thru the
bumpers, while VW sales surged further.
	Thus VW was setting the standard for
comfortable economical reliable cruising.
The regie, by now owned by the Republic, was not
going to let die Krdute win so easily.  They
tried seriously for unburstability in the the
mighty Sierra motor  -  powered the Floride
(quaint feeble attempt at playboy image), the 8,
the 10 (essentially a long-nose 8), 12, and some
versions of the 4 &amp; 5.
  I rank it the top small water-cooled 4-stroke.
Nothing of interest to me has come along since.
*  Five large main bearings;
* no block but 4 jammed-in centrifugal-cast iron
sleeves (as used by Richard Pearse  -  4&quot;
drainpipes in his case, and largely air-cooled)
and a lot of water;
*  high camshaft  so small inertia in pushrod/rocker
*  alum head
*  4-wheel disc brakes with no power or even vac assist
*  1300cc version in pretty little coupes,
breathed on by The Sorcerer, Amidie Gordini (to
Renault roughly what Abarth was to Fiat) won the
le Mans 24-h Index of performance 20 mpg
averaging 100 mph for 24h.  7500 rpm is all you
need, if you get breathing good  -  Munro &amp;
Gordini agreed on this.
*  R8 Gordini production 4-door 1255cc 105 bhp
with a year's guarantee; still defeats 7-litre
Mustangs on windy tracks; watch for it at Laguna
Seca.

	The 10 was the best small car  -  beetle
2nd if I recall  -  in Road Test 's incomparable
reports of the late '60s.  But Renault never
quite lived down the (somewhat unjust) reputation
of the Dauphine.
	 This 1600 lb car gets double the economy
of the 1600cc 3000 lb bus  -  53 mpgImp cruise,
same as stupid Honda &amp; Toymota 1500cc hybrids.
Oversteer is if anything more vicious than VW -
but in principle controllable.

	So it was geopolitical rivalry that
evoked the Sierra motor, and kept VW improving
design &amp; quality while trying to 'do a Citroen'
i.e get a couple decades ahead of the other mfrs
and then make only marginal changes for a couple
decades.  Jawa did this 1954-74 with their
Swinger {sic} 250 &amp; 350; VW with the centrifugal
fan / carb(s) flat 4; Renault didn't achieve any
such long runs of one type of vehicle, but the
mighty Sierra motor shone on in Latin Amer. 12s
for decades.  Marginal improvements of the flat 4
could still be made, and Brazil (etc?) supply
good buses &amp; campers for sensible people who
realise that, with competent hobbyist
maintenance, such vehicles can do 100,000 miles
with only small chances of breakdown.
