Subject: Potential fire averted

I was adjusting my rear/parking brakes this morning and took the time 
to inspect things overall.

It was good thing that I did the inspection. I found a fuel hose that 
had a crack and would hiss out gasoline when touched. The hose 
otherwise looked good and was not brittle, just goes to show you that 
there is no substitute for human touch (I have a side business as a 
massage therapist). I replaced the hose and did a good inspection on 
the others, they seem to be good, but I will do them all real soon.

The bad hose was on the return side of the fuel injection loop, right 
where it goes back into the fuel tank. It was not the high pressure 
type that I got from Ron at the Bus Depot. I am not sure that this 
particular hose needs to be high pressure, but I did replace it with 
a length of the good stuff, I think it is better to have the armour 
protection.
