Subject: Re: [T2] headlight chrome ring question

In a message dated 10/2/02 8:08:42 AM, dbolen_at_shockwaverider_dot_com writes:

&lt;&lt; I have two different kinds of chrome headlight rings on my 78 and need to 
know which is the correct one.

The passenger side is metal with a hella part number 11-941-175A
The drivers side is plastic with a KOA? part number of 211-941-177

Cheers, dave
 &gt;&gt;

My '71 had metal, the '79 plastic...My guess would be the later
the bus, the cheaper the parts...;-(
