Subject: transmission/shift linkage problem?

i've searched the archives and think my problem may be related to the shift
linkage -- but wanted to run it by the list as i couldn't specifically find
the 'exact' problem in the archives.  here goes...

recently had the engine ('76 Westy) removed to install a new clutch and
during engine reinstall I was moving the shifter between 2nd and neutral to
assist in alignment.  the engine went in, and I can turn the engine over
using the alternator pulley.  the bus isn't currently running, so this
weekend I was going to continue with my work to get it on the road -- i
shifted into 1st (shifter didn't feel like it was completely going into
first -- resistance), so i gave the bus a push and it rolled as if it were
in neutral.  i continued this process through the remaining gears with the
same result.  i'm not sure what i've done, but some guidance in
troubleshooting would be helpful...

unfortunately it looks like we're going to be getting a lot of rain the
next few days here in New Orleans...which is going to slow my progress.
ugh.

Thanks...Chris
