Subject: Was: Engine Oil Removal   Now: engine elevation

 &gt;I really don't want to try to drain the oil again.  It is sitting on a
 &gt;dolly, and I would have to 'lift' the engine another 8 inches to get below
 &gt;it.

Hint from Heloise (Oh, how I miss her!!)

I found that I can elevate my '72 engine/bell housing pretty easily. By 
myself. One hand, if you please...

Like the 'Arch' said, 'given a lever long enough and a place to stand, I 
could smack my landlord hard enough on the head that he would give me some 
heat in February!!'

So, given a sufficient number of blocks that could be trusted to make a 
solid pile, I could lift a '72 engine/bell housing high enough that I could 
get under it to make all necessary adjustments and oil changes.


Golly, I don't know why, but with just one hand, I can lift one side of the 
muffler end of the engine at least 3 inches.  Then I can slide a 2&quot; block 
under that side.  Next, do the same with the other side, just 2&quot; at a time 
so it does not get unbalanced. And I have a bunch of 2x6 cut stock from Home 
Depot....

But I cannot lift the front (starter side) of the engine, where the bell 
housing/starter is attached, even with both hands!!  I am a bit weak.

Well, after I get the rear (muffler end) of the engine elevated, I put a 
brace of block(s) under the middle of the engine, so it just fits, and 
touched the bottom of the engine.

Then I REMOVE some of the 2&quot; blocks from the rear (muffler) of the engine, 
and the front (starter side) of the engine pivots up in the air.  I slip 
another block under the bell housing/front/starter end of the engine, and 
then I repeat:

I again walk the rear (muffler) of the engine up 2&quot; at a time on each side 
until I get decent air under the block(s) at the middle of the engine (1&quot;), 
add another block or plank in that new air space, drop the rear (muffler) 
again and thereby pivoting the engine and raising the front (starter) -

and on and on.

I know, a lot of you have used this technique, but I am still amazed that I 
can do it, still a newbie after 8 years of VW ownership.

But I still don't have enough heat this February...
