Subject: Re: [T2] Ignition switch problems :-(

 After you have done what Mark said to do, put the
 bus in netural, set the parking brake and chock the
 wheels. Disconnect the battery. Crawl under the bus
on the passenger side by the rear wheel and check the
 wires on the starter. The small one(female
 connection)from the Ign switch, make sure it has a
 good contact. The big wires coming from the
 battery,alternator and other things that are
 connected to the big bolt(8mm with a 13mm nut on it) 
on top of the solenoid make sure the connections are
clean. Connect the battery and try to start it.. Phil
