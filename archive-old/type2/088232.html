Subject: Re: [T2] Keeping a bus from being stolen

How about some sort of a fuel-shutoff solenoid under the fuel tank?
I've thought about installing such a thing just as fire insurance: the
idea that I own a vehicle with an unlimited, unstoppable, gravity-fed
fuel supply flowing directly into the engine compartment gives me the
creeps.  Now that I think about it, though, this would make a great
anti-theft device as well.  Same scenario as another listmember
described: stolen bus can be found stranded in the middle of the street
not all that far from the scene of the crime...
