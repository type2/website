&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; did not come over well. But am I right in cutting a 4&quot; square hole in
&gt;&gt; &gt; the middle &amp; 4&quot; back from the 45 degree of the wheel arch section?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All I can say, is don't cut your bus there!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;I came in late.  Why do people make this cut?  

It's an easy way to change the Fuel tank sender without pulling the 
engine.
I've done it twice with no side effects, and would do it again.
