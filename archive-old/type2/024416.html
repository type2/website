 Hi again,

&gt; The senders are likely to be compatible, since they are all VDO.

 Turns out this was cack- the oil temp gauge is not electrically
compatible, apparantly.

 I'd also like to apologise for consistantly spelling gauge incorrectly
throughout the entire post!! :-(

 At least it will have reduced the credibility of my wildly inaccurate
assertions!!

Cheers,
