&gt; I am going to add a CB radio to my bus.  Went to Radio Shack, they have

&gt; large buggy whip bumper mount and a cell phone antenna look-a-like that
&gt; sticks to each side of the glass.  Anyone using either of these?  Any
&gt; suggestions for alternates?

Neither of these will be ideal, but ideal isn't really possible.

The bumper mount is too close to the body and won't radiate properly.  The
through-the-glass antenna is probably better for you situation, but it is
pretty small for that frequency range.

Better for a bus is a 4' firestik whip (found at truck suppliers) attached
to the drip rail or to the luggage rackk.

The through-the-glass antenna will probably meet your needs for
caravanning.  I prefer FRS, but sometimes your buddies only have CB.
