&gt; Hi Dennis,
&gt; 
&gt; I mounted a HANG-ON!!! strap from a passenger bus on the inside of my 
&gt; slider. It uses one of the existing bolts and I drilled a hole for a 
&gt; short sheet-metal screw. I've used it at least three times and it 
&gt; hasn't snapped off yet!

I've had one of those on my slider for about 5-6 years and use it daily
since I get in and out via the slider, it came loose once but better
mounting has caused it to stay put.
