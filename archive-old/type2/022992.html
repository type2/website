Let's see... The 72-75 bellhousings appear to be idential, as do 76-79 
which are 1/2&quot; thicker.  The 76-79 trannies are also 1/2&quot; thicker in the 
nosecone area than 72-75 for a total increased thickness of 1&quot;, which will 
cause problems if you try to swap an entire tranny with bellhousing between 
these sets of years.

 From memory:  The ratios for 1st through 3rd gears are identical for 68-79 
trannies. 4th gear was .82 from 68-73 and .88 from 74-79.  Ring and pinion 
was 42/8 (5.375) for 68-73, 34/7 (4.86) for 74-75, and 32/7 (4.57) for 76-79.

1974 was a big transition year - I'm not sure the 4th gear change occurred 
at the same time as the ring and pinion change so don't bank on a '74 
tranny being what the book says.  Which brings up a point - everything in 
this post is contained in Bentley, and is also in the archives multiple 
times.  You know what to do.

&gt;It's WAY more complicated than that! 68-mid 69 are the same, mid 69 + 70 are
&gt;the same, 71 is the same as 70 with a slightly different bellhousing, 72 has a
&gt;different bellhousing again, and different input shaft,  73... I can't
&gt;remember, 74 and 75 have different ratios, but 75 case is a little different
&gt;than 74. 76-79 are a LOT different, enough to warrant a different type number
&gt;(091 vs 002 of the earlier ones) bigger gears, bigger r+p, different ratios
&gt;again. It goes on up thru Vanagons, basically every time the engine changes,
&gt;the trans changes. Partly because of torque curves and requirements, sometimes
&gt;to build them easier i.e., cheaper. (091/1)
&gt;David Schwarze can probably fill in some of the gaps in my database.
