Subject: What goes where #1 (injection)

Good day guys, as am almost ready to install my 78 injection on my 73 i 
would need precise picture of all vaccum and hoses, as to where they 
connect!

I have a good idea but am missing quite a few tube, hose and vaccum 
location, the Bentley pictures are far from showing them all. If you 
have good pictures or a good URL please send them to me (p-mail).

This post is the first of a few, i will appreciate your kind help so i 
can get that bus going, since my last trip to Mexico ( 
http://www.eurokitplane_dot_com/intro.htm ) it as been sitting in the 
garage. I have 10 days before a show to get that bus running (the engine 
is not even in the Bus, but it's ready), i need your help (It's now my 
turn to ask for some help.................)

For now am still in the painting and cleaning proccess, the FI i got was 
very dirty.
Like everything i do, i do it very nicely. So there is no way am putting 
that dirty and uncheck injection in my Bus.

please send any clear pictures you have to my e-mail, am &quot;cable&quot; so 
picture size dont matter.

Best regards, Ben
