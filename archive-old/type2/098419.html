Subject: friday bus sighting

anyone have the discovery channel?
ever see that UK show called &quot;perfect partner&quot;?
i have seen this one before but they are playing it again today...
the guy they are trying to find a &quot;perfect partner&quot; for today is a guy
who drives a bay window bus. the whole interview with him, the tv crew
taping him tell us what kind of girl he likes, he is sitting IN his
bus!!! not just a bus cameo, you see it half the show! way cool. he
called it the &quot;love bus&quot;, LMAO! and it has big spots on it, not exactly
like cow, more like leopard spots only the size of cow spots.he has a
handle on the slider door up next to the jalousie windows. ok, i dont
know the changes enough to know the years, but it had the taller
taillights than i have on my 70, so i dont know what year it was. oddly,
there are sliding doors on both sides of the bus. is it normal for busses
in the UK to have two sliding doors? he took the first girl on the date
in his bus!  while they are eating dinner on the second date, there is a
reflection of a yellow golf in the window.

for those who dont know, the premise of the show is this:
2 family members look for the perfect date for the person in question
while 2 of that person's friends look for the perfect date for them. each
team asks lots of questions of people on the street, when they find an
available match, they take a polaroid of them. then each team gets
together with the host of the show and narrow it down to one person. they
go on one date with each team's choice and choose the one they like
best... and sometimes they dont pick either.
