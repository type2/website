Subject: Hardwood floors in a westy

O.k. this is coming from left field, but I've read about a few others who 
have seen it done.  I would like to put oak hardwood floors in my 71 westy.  
I have the entire rear interior stripped out right now, and have a bunch of 
oak and plywood left over from doing the floors in  my house.  It seems very 
possible to attempt it but I have a few Q's.  Will the height of the 
subloors, and oak combined cause a disturbance with the bed and tall cabinets 
 Also,  I would seal all the wood including subfloor before puttting them in, 
but will moisture still be an issue? Would it be o.k to run some wiring for 
guages under the floor before I install it?  (I was envisioning a wire 
cooking in a puddle of water under there someday)  Speaking of the subfloor, 
I've read 3/8 and also 11/32, and 13/32 plywood.  Which is the correct one to 
level it out? 

Thanks
