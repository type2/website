Subject: Re: heat smells like exhaust

I think a lot of times, we mistake the smell of oil (which has dripped down
into the heater boxed from leaky valve covers or pushrod tubes) as exhaust.
At least I do. Problem is, even once you repair the leaks, it takes some
time for the oil smell to burn away.

Good luck! Joe

&gt;Needless to say it never went off and after running the heater every day for
&gt;about a week the smell has diminished.
