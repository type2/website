Subject: 72-74 EGR Filter

Hi all -

Sorry for re-posting this, but I'm really stuck for an
answer. Can anyone help at all? Summary: Am I correct
in thinking that a '72-'74 EGR filter will *not* fit
on my '78 that has a '72-'74 exhaust conversion? (the
original '78 filter doesn't fit)

---- original message ----

I did the fabled '72-'74 exhaust conversion on my '78
Westy a few months ago. The only thing I haven't yet
resolved is the issue of the EGR filter. With the new
setup, the bottom pipe on the original ('78) EGR
filter looks like it lines up OK with the connector
flange on the muffler, but it's 3&quot; too short!

From Richard's microfiches, it appears that the
'72-'74 EGR filter
looks completely different
(http://www.ratwell_dot_com/technical/Microfiche/t201800.gif
- part # 43) - it looks as though it definitely would
not fit. Bus Depot doesn't have any pictures to refer
to, but this filter at cip1_dot_com resembles the
microfiche:

Mid America has pictures, but doesn't tell you which
is which:

The original '78 looks like the bottom right one. None
of the others look like they'd fit the current setup.

Am I correct in thinking that a '72-'74 EGR filter
will *not* fit? I'm almost resigned to the fact that
I'll just have to weld a 3&quot; extension on my '78
filter, but if I can buy a filter that I am certain
will fit without modification, then I'd rather do
that.

Thanks!
