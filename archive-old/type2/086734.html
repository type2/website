Figures, you try to explain your real needs... and you just get a smart-ass.
Pat yourself on the back there Nemo.  You're a real winner.

OK.  Then buy a new GEX engine, preferably 1835
or larger, put the biggest carbs you can find, at
least dual 40's, a chrome 009 (this is really the
key), and a Monza exhaust.  Everyone knows that
these are the best engines for your kind of
driving.  They are featured every month in VWT
and HVW.  This combo will run well for at least
3-4,000 miles and is guaranteed not to overheat
much during that time.  No way are you gonna be
stuck in the slow lane, dude.  You can probably
easily do 85mph with this combo.
