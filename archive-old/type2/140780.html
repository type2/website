Subject: Re: [T2] fuel tank sending unit information

From Marcus Schaper:

 I would take one or two if the price is right. BUT, there is no 73-79 unit.
 There was at least one change in this range - I think in 74. Can you get the
 p/n or verify for which years these senders are?

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

He is correct. The split between the early 5 screw sender 211919051 and the late twist lock sender 211919051A 
was up to 1/73 (chassis #2x3 2138 900) and from 2/73 (chassis 2x3 2138 901).
