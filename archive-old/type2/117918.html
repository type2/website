Subject: Re: [T2] Toyota Bus??

Hi Folks,

I owned one of those Toyota vans (model name: Van), and they're pretty good, 
except for the fact that nobody likes to work on them anymore.  They have 
about the same amount of interior space as a Bus does, and are pretty well 
appointed inside.  The engine is between the front seats, which makes it a 
pain to work on, but it's water cooled, so they have real heat.  Mine had 
4WD, so it made for a great backcountry camping vehicle.  They'll cruise at 
80 on a flat road, and are as reliable as Toyotas can be expected to be.

Obligatory Bus content:  When I bought my Bus, I sold my Toyota, and cleaned 
all my stuff out of it.  When I put all the stuff into the Westy cabinets, I 
had a lot of space left over -- I guess the Japanese never had much of a 
market for camper conversions for the Toyotas.  Plus, nobody really ever 
waved at me or stopped to chat about their old Toyota like they do with my 
Bus.  And perhaps the best reason of all for owning a Bus, there's no list 
list the Type 2 List!!

Thanks again for making Bus ownership fun.
