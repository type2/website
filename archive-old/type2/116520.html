Subject: Banned in the EU

Well, Bob,

Few of us bus pilots us are lucky enough to have 1998 T2's imported via methods we refuse to mention on our websites, so you're living a bit of a luxury compared to the rest of us. And more power to you, really.

The rest of us have to deal with the realities of keeping an old vehicle functional, and some of us are a little perturbed about the way in which the auto/oil industry/gestapo is removing one of the main vestiges of do-it-yourself-ism.

You sound a little too skittish about perceived &quot;dangers&quot; these vehicles pose.

It's been pretty much agreed upon around the world, and it's just like guns...

A bus is a just a tool, it's all about the operator.

&gt;I don't comment on the driving laws in California &gt;and other parts of the USA

I don't think that means I can't comment about the laws in the EU...

&gt;but as a citizen of the EU I don't want structurally &gt;unsound vehicles on OUR roads endangering MY life -

How big a danger is this? Really?
I'm much more worried about drunk drivers than structural defects.

Billy
