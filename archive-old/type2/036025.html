Subject: Just Kampers rock!

I just snagged a NOS RH underside tin piece from Just Kampers for my 2.0.
These bits are hard enough to come by used in the UK, but *new*...  It still
had the original picking slip taped to it with a date of June '78.  This tin
has been sitting in a warehouse longer than my bus has been on the road.
Type 2 archaeology!  I don't know where they get this stuff from but you've
got to hand it to them.  I think they will be sending a load of rare panels
to the states soon.  Don't know where to.  Ron?
