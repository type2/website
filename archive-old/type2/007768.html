Subject: Half a ring job -- can I get away with it?

'76, 2 liter

Compression test numbers:

#1  115 plus/minus 3 psi
#2  115 plus/minus 3 psi
#3  115 plus/minus 3 psi
#4   30 psi dry, 60 psi wet

I am planning a rebuild, but not for about six months. In the meantime I 
want to drive it (In moderate ambient temps) no more than 5,000 miles all 
together. Some long trips and some short ones.

Can I get away with putting new rings on #4 piston (assuming no serious 
damage) for the short term? I have to put new pushrod seals on both 
sides, but I would rather leave 1/2 head alone on the theory that if it 
ain't broke don't fix it.

So is that the operative theory? Opinions requested and humbly welcomed.

Mark Hineline
