Subject: Re: [T2] Fool moon in June(Deerfield park south of Ashville)

I hear ya, Phil! Last year my girl Robyn and I *did*
quit our jobs to go camping, and we happened to be in
N. Carolina for the Full Moon in Joon campout last
year with Snoopy, Uncle Dave and the rest of the crew.
We had a blast and can't wait to get our camp on out
here in California with other VW'ers some time soon.
Hope all you FMiJ'ers had a great time... and great
burritos!!  

xoxo,

Peter, Robyn and the Brave Little Toaster
it's never too late to quit your job and go camping

&gt; Did anyone go to it, anyone to report on the
&gt; campout.
&gt; would like to hear about it. I hate having to work,
&gt; think I'll quit so I can go camping.  Phil
