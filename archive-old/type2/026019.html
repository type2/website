Subject: Anyone need anything for a 78?

I have a 78 ex-westy donor in Virginia Beach, Virginia that the city informs
me must be gone within a week (although I am asking for an extension).
Serves me right for living within a mile of the courthouse!

If anyone needs parts for a late bay let me know. Engine is gone, interior
is (mostly) gone, but much of the rest is available either cheap or free.
Tell me what you need and I'll see if I can find it :)

I'm not much interested in shipping so if you can't pick it up then there
would be some cost involved.
