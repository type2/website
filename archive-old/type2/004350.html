Subject: won't start, no lights
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello,

My '70 westy w/ a 1600dp   won't start.  The situation is I drove her this
afternoon, started, ran no probem, get in her this evening to go to the
store and nary a click.  no dash lights, nothing.  In reading the idiot
guide, they take you from  dash  lights on but wont start but I'm not even
there!  Could this be an ignition switch?  It seems weird that it happened
out of the blue, no prior sign of impending doom.  I plan on starting
diagnosis tomorrow &amp; any head start you folks can give me is a  plus!

thanks,

Dave
