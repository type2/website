Hi,

I've never seen one of the switches you are looking for in person, but I've 
seen pictures of it (http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/pix/603293.jpg).
It looks like the rear defroster switch but with a yellow lens with the 
drawing of a fog light. As I understand it is a 2 position switch, the 
first one turns on the rear fog light (or the front ones, maybe?) and the 
second one turns both the front and rear fog lights. If you find a source 
for them, let us know.

Regards,

&gt;Also, I like for stuff to LOOK stock, and I was wondering if anyone knows 
&gt;of a fog lamp switch that is similar in style to that of the factory knobs 
&gt;used in the mid 70s busses.
