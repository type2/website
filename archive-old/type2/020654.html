Underbelly gas heaters can be expensive,, as much as $300 on Ebay,iirc, I sold
one to a fellow in Korea and he was willing to pay the us$250 + us$120
shipping,,

I included the Duct that Karl is talking about,, which you CAN get out in one
piece,,not from underneath tho. 
Karl is right about the torsion tube,,

I don't know about different floor patterns,  so i can't say what is involved
with that ....
measurements i give are examples only,,, not to scale,, YMMV  :-)

Take the duct out from the top [inside the bus] by using a saws-all ..cutting a
slot in the cargo floor, cut more floor than you need from the donor,,put the
duct in the same way,, but cut a smaller hole from the good floor, and place the
duct in from inside the bus,,  you can rivit or varethane or weld it back in,, 
measure where you took the duct from and mark it right on the floor part you cut
out

Imagine a 4&quot;x10&quot; part under the floor,  so cut the donor 6&quot; x 14&quot; or bigger,,
you can trim it later,, and lift the duct up and out,with a part of the floor
attached,

then cut your installation hole 4 1/2&quot; x 10 1/2&quot; so that you have a flange to
sit on the floor and hold the duct from falling thru the hole.. then rivit it in
,, or varathane,,,, or cut it EXACTLY and weld it in and grind the welds and
paint it OG and only you would know it wasn't factory!

in other words,,, have you ever installed a dryer vent in the side of your
house,, it has a duct and a flange,, so you cut a 4&quot; hole in the house,, and
slide in a 6&quot; cover. same idea here.

The Rest of the stuff is easy, just make sure you MARK the wiring, and get all
the controls from under the dash...
sorry,,  a total loss of c drive and i don't have the fische pics or photo's any
more,,,

Best I can do for now,,

&gt; &gt;      I have a chance to buy a '79 bus with a
&gt; &gt; under-belly gas heater (BA-6??). 
 transferring the complete heat
&gt; &gt; system into a '76 Westy?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it is a BA6.
&gt; Good luck!  The floor is different. You will find a duct that is mounted
&gt; under the rear seat that was put in before the rear torsion tube was
&gt; installed. With the tube in, you cannot get the duct out! [this duct pulls
&gt; the air from inside the bus to run thru the heater] Also, the main unit is
&gt; mounted on rubber mounts, like the FI fuel pump, that are screwed to
&gt; brackets. These brackets are welded to the frame.....they are not there on a
&gt; bus without the BA6 heater....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, what is the going price for a complete
&gt; &gt; under-belly gas heater system?
&gt; 
&gt; No idea....
&gt; I had the same idea, pulled a complete BA6 from a Canadian 79 also.....
&gt; still haven't installed it in my 77.
