Subject: good battery brands?

We have a fleet of four ac vws o n our &quot; lot&quot;.  The neighbors might not be
as enthusiastic about this as we are, but.......

Two of these  -  a bus and a '79 vert  -  have been sitting throughout the
winter months while I rebuild engines.  In the past week,  I've finished a
rebuild and needed to start an engine on a test stand in the garage. Two of
the four batteries which worked just fine last autumn were dead and
wouldn't take a charge at the local gas station.  Both were less than three
years old. So it looks as though I'm in the market for batteries.

Before I head on down to Sears,  does anyone have good or bad experiences
with various brands to share?  Does any  brand beat the odds and give a
good unit every time?

Thanks, Jack
