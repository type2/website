Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg
  dipstick oil temp sensor

Hi All, here is a summary of recent work on overheating

I went for a 40 mile ride on Saturday. I was able to drive the bus
normally (55-60mph) in 80+ degree weather. There was flat and also
hills.

At 60mph on the freeway oil temp is around 200F
A 5 mile 40mph uphill on third brought oil temps to 220
Around town oil is in the 180-190F range.
(All temps read with turkey thermometer stuck in dipstick, engine idling)

Head temp readings were often under the 350F mark. (VDO)

This is at least 20F reduction compared to the oil temps I observed
earlier this season YIPEE !!  Here is a list of things I did to limit
overheating. My estimate of the cooling effect is rated from 1 to 3
(maximum)
-	changed fan belt from generator (slick) to alternator (cranks),
engine to fan ratio increased from 1:1.75 to 1:2 (3)
-	Fixed yet another power brake related vacuum leak (a few loose
clamps on vacuum line) (3)
-	Went from main 120 to main 125. Eventually I may go to 127.5 or 130
but would like to see AFM measurement before doing this (3)
-	Used proper idle/power jets. On the Brosol 30/31, the idle jet is on
the right in the front. Behind it at 45 degree angle is the power jet.
I was inverting them. Went from idle/power 65/55 to 55/65. Means it
runs richer at higher RPM (2)
-	Still playing with timing on the stock advance/retard dizzy. Timing
seems to be a real compromise between power and fuel economy on one
side and heat and pinging on the other. The 71 dp is supposed to be
timed at 5deg ATDC with the stock vacuum advance/retard distributor.
That is not happening for me, with such a setting the engine does not
have enough power to idle and even when it does it has no power on the
road. At 0deg it does idle and seems to not overheat but fuel economy
and power are not great (16.5 mpg). These days I'm experimenting with
2.5 deg BTDC. The power is there and temps look OK. In the early days
of the overheating problem timing was set to 5 deg BTDC and I believe
I could hear pinging on up hills in third. Timing IS important (3+)
-	Repaired the lower part of the oil cooler exhaust cover tin. This
little piece of tin gathers the warm air from the bottom of the cooler
into the air duct. (1)
-	Checked both oil pressure valves. Looked OK. Extended both oil
pressure and oil relief springs manually with the hope that it
increases oil pressure and oil flow through oil cooler (2 ?)
-	Scraped paint on valve covers (1)
-	Cut the inside of PO's mudguards. The mudguards were covering the
whole section under the rear wheel wells, in my opinion reducing the
air flow around the exhaust, resulting in more than optimal heat from
the muffler staying around the rear apron. I cut them so they are
thinner and let the air &quot;coming from the shocks&quot; cool around the rear
apron(1)
-	Switched from WT40 to WT30 oil hoping that the lower viscosity would
improve flow. Since I do not let the oil get hot anyways I don't need
the higher flash point / viscosity of the thicker oil (1)
-	Cleaned exterior of oil cooler (fins) with carb cleaner (1)
-	Sealed fresh air hoses to heater boxes (more air through heater box,
more heat taken away from around the heads) (1)
-	Swapped &quot;high performance&quot; air cleaner for a stock oil bath air
cleaner (not sure if it does anything related to overheating) (0)
-	Bought a turkey thermometer graduated until 220 degrees F to read
oil temps for 8$. Very useful to know if a modification helps or not

I hope these will give another couple ideas to the others on the list
with hot oil. For now I keep the bus oil cooling stock and will see
how far it takes me.

Like others said; when it comes to cooling oil, it is a bunch of small
things that add together and bring the oil temp down. Not one big
thing.

This week-end the bus will drink Pemex .
