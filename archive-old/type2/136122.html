Subject: something else

Hi all - 
 
Something else that I don't think is related, but what the heck do I know - 
 
I have a hybridized 81 Vanagon.  It was originally CA emissions.  The exhaust system was a piece of rust, and replacements were no longer available, so taking the advice of the Bus Depot, I replaced it with a 49 state system and had my local mechanic put in a spot for the oxygen sensor.
 
The EGR filter was also a huge piece of rust.  Apparantely the pipe I need to connect a new one is also no longer available.  I disconnected the remains of the old EGR and sealed up the hole that leads to it from the engine.
 
So, I'm running without an EGR at all.  A few VW people told me that wouldn't be a problem, since in 1980 the CA vanagon didn't have one.  In 81 and on, the CA vanagons had both an EGR and O2 sensor.
 
My local VW guy also ripped out part of the CA system.  He even replaced the electronic distributor with one with points; said it is much more reliable.
 
I don't know if all these things are even relevant, but I thought I would post them anyway.  If any of them are making a difference with my problem, I don't understand why it would be getting steadily worse.  Shouldn't it be the same all the time if these issues are causing a problem?
 
Thanks again for your time.
 
Marc
