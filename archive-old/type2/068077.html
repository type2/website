This reminds me.  I bought new rubber seals to go around my rims (on
my '66, the adjusters are at 4 and 10, FWIW).  I can get the seals
into the gap between the bucket and the body without significant
problem.  What I can't do, however, is get the rims themselves on
afterwards.  They're a pretty tight fit without any rubber in there,
and I can't seem to compress the rubber deep enough into the gap to
get the rim to hook onto the bucket (this is on the side away from the
hold-down bolt).

This indicates (choose as many as apply):

A The nose-skin is bent
B The bucket is bent
C Everything's bent
D Find some non-wimp to do the installation
E Go get a caulking gun, like everybody else
F ?
