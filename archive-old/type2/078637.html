Subject: Re: [T2] Looking for the air hose to make my wiper washer work

Hi Adam
Are you talking about a Bus, or a Bug.... &lt;surprized look on my face&gt; I didn't
know they *made* a hose that goes from the windsheild washer fluid bottle to the
spare tire, like a Beetle.

Maybe it is a rare option? ?   I dunno,, just asking,, 

I have always used a bicycle tire air pump to add the air to the bottle.  

Adam, I am not saying there isn't a hose like you asking for,, I have just never
seen one!.. and that would be interesting to know about :-) I have never seen a
million dollars,, But I know *THAT it exists!

No offense intended,, but have YOU seen one of these ??
