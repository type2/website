Subject: '78 VW type2 gas heater

Hello,

I was given this address and told I could find information here about
my VW bus.

The problem with my heater is that when I turn it on it blows cold
air for a few minutes then trips a circuit breaker under the dash and
quits. Both fans seem to work OK.

Would appreciate any advice and/or information about how the system
works and electrical diagrams.

Hopefully,

Joe Scilla
