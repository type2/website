&gt;  I finally got ahold of a fuel pressure tester today, but of course
&gt; since nothing is ever simple in my life, the gauge has a threaded

&gt;main.  Not deterred and after seriously considering cutting off the end
&gt;  
&gt;  Shouldn't the fuel pressure gauge (brand new) read at least something

in the 30-34 psi range

&gt; since fuel is being pumped?  This fuel pump is an FI pump but had been
&gt; pumping to a carb for the last couple of years, could this have
&gt; over-worked it and caused it to drop it's pressure output?

can't happen, a carb uses 2-4 psi  FI uses 30-34 psi  (check Bentley for
exact presures.


was gonna answer more of your questions but got tired of manually
formatting your original message, turn on your word wrap and set it at
about 74 or so then repost and I'll answer the rest of your questions, or
maybe someone else will.

&gt; My Bentley says the hose from the fuel pump connects to the pressure regulator, but mine goes to the ring main on the left side of the engine before eventually reaching the regulator on the other side.  Do I have something backwards?   Looks right to me.
&gt;  
&gt; Last question (for now): Fuel flows from the tank out of the return hose when unplugged from the regulator,  that's supposed to happen right?
&gt;
