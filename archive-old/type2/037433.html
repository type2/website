Jeff, 
You will probably have to hit the junkyards for this part. It may be an
extended search, depending on the year of your bus.  The 71 is a 1 year
only part, to accomodate the doghouse oil cooler.  If you are going to
remove the engine(which you'll probably have to do to get it out) you
might want to consider upgrading to the doghouse if yours doesn't have
one.  Much better cooling.  The bus tin is just like the b*g tin, with
an extra piece welded to the top.  I made my breast tin (71) from a
doghouse beetle tin and some 22-24 gauge galavanized sheet steel.  Just
use your old one for a template.  Use pliers, etc. to turn a 3/16&quot;
flange on the top edge.  A few pop rivets, and some RTV, and good as,
well it works:)
