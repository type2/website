Subject: Re: [T2] Nutz &amp; Boltz


&gt; I pulled out the rear seat seatbelts.  The bolts out of the body were the
&gt; original Repa 8.8s.  17mm heads.  I went to chase the threads and none of my
&gt; metric dies would fit.  Lo and behold a 7/16 coarse did the job.
&gt;
&gt; So, what's the deal here?  Metric heads and standard threads?  What gives?

It should have been 7/16 fine thread. I believe it is universal, world-wide,
because Fords use it, Mercedes use it, VW use it......
