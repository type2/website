Subject: Re: [T2] Aux. battery relay

Thanks, that does have some good info. and has the wiring diagrams for both of
the ways I have tried it.

In the response by Ron from Bus Depot he states &quot; It is also important to note
that you must use the
wire gauge provided with the kit in order to maintain that intended rate of
charge.  This is a case where upgrading to a lower gauge (heavier) wire is
not a desirable thing, and in fact can result in the relay overloading and
popping the fuse.&quot;

That sounds like exactly what is happening in my set up but I used only the
wires that came with the kit. Maybe I'll shoot Ron an email and see what he
thinks unless he sees this thread first.

  Jamie Rivers has a pretty good write up about the different ways to
  wire an aux battery in.
