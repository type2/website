Subject: [T2] My bus website

Hi all,

I have done a bit of updating on my website, nothing major but it now
reflects the actual number of buses I own again. All of them &quot;Transporters&quot;
, ranging from '69 (T2) to '00 (T4). (Eric M: I'm sure this will confuse the
US members of this list :-)

So if you have some time left between counting votes and eating turkey you
can see for yourself on: http://www.hrps_dot_demon.nl/jwbus/index.htm

Of course the 'piece de resistance' is still the 'welding for absolute
dummies' page.
