Subject: Where to stick your bikes???

(I knew I would get your attention with that subject line!!) 

Why not in FRONT!

There are some bike racks that will attach to a mounted spare tire.  I
haven't seen any good ones, though.

But it definitely will give pedestrians second thoughts as they try to
cross in front of you!!(good)

Every driver will look at you and think you are a loony, hippie bus
driver, and give you a wide berth (good)

And I have statistics show that bikes mounted up front have a lower
occurrence of pilferage/theft than bikes mounted in the rear. (Of
course, as any consultant worth their salt, I also have statistics that
will show the opposite)

Now the serious part.

Why not take the front mounted spare off, and devise a bike rack that
would securely attach to the 3-point bolts of the vacant tire mount?? 
It would keep the bikes closer to the bus body, and you may be able to
use the front bumper for 'bounce' support.

A relatively easy to make a portable mount might be devised by cutting
out the middle of a 'junk' wheel for the portable mounting attachment,
and weld/permanently attach a bike rack to the cut_out_middle_etc.  

Probably need straps to hold the sides of the bikes to the side of the
bus, but you should not need straps to go up and over your windshield to
the top of the bus (where there is nothing to attach it to, anyway!!)

The tire could go inside the bus (novel idea, what!!)  

Or, could you buy another tire mount from Bus Depot and place it BENEATH
the front of the bus, on the SPLASH PLATE between the front wheels?? 
The fastenings will probably need to be reinforced, and spare tire
access may not be convenient, but when was the last time anyone changed
their tire when they had taken bikes along ¿¿ &lt;&lt;-- rhetorical question:
I have statistics for that, too!!

And with bikes mounted up front, where you are constantly looking at
them, you WILL drive cautiously, and look for deer WAY down the road!!
