Subject: How many 34PICT-3 designs are there?

Wow!!
I agree with David, I have seen a number of slight variations, I even have 
one from Brazil which is very different.
I too have never seen that adjustment before, so not certain how to adjust 
it. What that diaphragm does is to open the choke up slightly if you drive 
off when still cold. The normal non adjustable ones do have a stop cast into 
the cover in the picture. My guess would be to adjust yours to the same 
length as the non adjustable one. It's function will not affect normal 
running, so I can't see the adjustment being critical.

At least two! I have two BOCAR 34PICT-3's made in Mexico that are
different in several ways(different styles of jets, different number of
vacuum ports,...). Maybe one was a Calif version? What I am curious
about here is that one has an adjustment for the automatic choke vacuum
diaphragm while the other does not. Here are pictures of both types:

I've gone through the archives, library, and all of my other information
sources and cannot find a procedure for adjusting the choke vacuum
diaphragm. Does anyone know what the procedure is?

Sincere Thanks,
