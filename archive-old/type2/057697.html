I assume you're replacing the jugs and pistons, not just the jugs.  There
is no reason to split the case if you think the bottom end of the engine is
good.  It will not hurt anything.  Splitting the case is a lot of work, and
if you go that far you should do a full rebuild and replace all of the
bearings.
