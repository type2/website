You'll probably be fine with the JB Weld as is.  It was a good idea to
roughen the area first.  I would not put it inside.  If it falls off, I'd
rather have a crack/vacuum leak again than clumps of JB Weld rolling down
the manifold, trying to get by the valve and into the combustion chamber.
Don't think the intake valves would appreciate the company...

&gt; OK. So I started her up this morning and started spraying carb cleaner
&gt; until I isolated acrack in the manifold! The rubber &quot;boots&quot; are fine.
Doesn't matter how
&gt; much I spray them, theRPM remains the same. But that crack in the
manifold...
&gt;
&gt; I pulled the carb and manifold.
&gt; The crack is just below the vacuum port for the brake assist. I cleaned
&gt; the manifold as good asI can. Used a file to roughen up the surface and
applied a liberal coat of
&gt; JB Weld over the areaof the crack.
&gt;
&gt; I then turned my attention to the carb. I sprayed it off with carb cleaner
&gt; and polished it some. I looked for identifying marks but could find none.
&gt; It sure looks likeall the pictures of the Weber Progressive 32/36 DFEV.
About that time the
&gt; UPS guy pulled upwith my order from BusDepot - including a rebuild kit for
the DFEV. With
&gt; luck, tonight I willrebuild the carb with my father's guidance - giving me
something to do
&gt; while the JB Weld setsup.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had any experience with using JB Weld in this kind of
&gt; application? ShouldI put JB Weld on the inside of the manifold (where the
crack is coming
&gt; through? I'll probablyswap this out in the fall for dual carbs, but or now
I'm trying to save
&gt; bread.
