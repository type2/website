Subject: Roofs

I might as well take this opportunity to ask if there is anyone interested
in a free 71 Westy roof?

All the camper parts are gone, but the metal shell of the roof that remains
is in pretty good shape.  I remember not too long ago there was discussion
to swapping a regular roof for a sunroof/camper roof.  Ambitious yes but I
don't remember if anyone ever actually did it.

Anyway, if someone wants it, it is free, but you have to come pick it up.
I'm in suburban Atlanta.  In less than a couple weeks this poor parts car is
heading off to the recycler, so speak soon so I can get the roof off,
otherwise I will just leave it alone.

Also, I have a regular roof off a 72 someone can have for free also.  Again,
you have to pick it up.  I got this from another list member, and never have
used it, so, anyone, anyone, Bueller?
