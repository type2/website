Subject: Re: [T2] WTB Window Crank

And for those who are looking for the best repro of the Black with Chrome
Disk style used on the 68-69 Models (also fits 70-79 as well), VWG has been
making these for a little over a year. Light-years in quality ahead of the
Brazilian Crapola in the J&amp;L Bags, these are a virtual repro from a NOS
German handle. The knob doesn't come off in 3 weeks (or less sometimes), and
the fit and finish is outstanding. Sold under original number 113-837-581 D
_at_
http://www.airheadparts_dot_com.
 Airhead/VWG went thru the second shipment in June so fast (a lot of Bugs &amp;
Ghias &amp; Type 3s use them as well), that we're out right at this moment, but
have another 1000 coming in the next 30-60 days.
