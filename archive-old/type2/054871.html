&gt; So ive heard everything from needing a 20inch one to a 24 inch one. I havent

NO :-( 19&quot; is not high enough.  mine goes to 19 1/2&quot; and if I put it under
the shock mount in the rear, jack it up all the way, put a jackstand under
the rear torsion bar housing, and lower it, the unloading of the rear
suspension will just *barely* keep the tire off the ground (maybe 1/2&quot;).  
At the rear tire, between the ground and the bottom of the frame on my '73
there is nearly a foot of air (11 3/4&quot;, i just measured it). You have to
go up a foot from there to get the tire off the ground, which means that
24&quot; is fine, anything less will be a PITA.  You *can* use a jack with a
shorter lift. I do.  All the time. And curse it.  All the time.

&gt; Is 19 inches the majic number I should be watching out for? or do I need 
&gt; higher?

In my opinion, 24&quot; is the majic number, honest!

&gt; ive been doing some shopping around and ive heard of people carrying this 
&gt; SUV specific set that includes the jackstands as well, but havent been able 
&gt; to find one yet.

Barry Burneskis found this set, nice jack stands and a 24&quot; jack, on sale
at ?K-Mart? some time last year and posted it to the list.  I did not take
advantage because I had a jack and stands. Since then I have seen what
Barry bought and I am kicking myself every time I use mine.  I strongly
recommend looking 'til you find the right jack.  

On a side note...jack stands.... do not buy the tube-in-tube style with
the sheet metal saddle...  they are a joke.  Look for heavy guage steel on
the base and a cast saddle. Buy like your life depends on them, cuz it
does!

I went looking for a 24&quot; decent jack and alas, cannot find one :-( The
closest I came was a 21&quot; from J.C. Whitney:
http://www.jcwhitney_dot_com/item.jhtml?ITEMID=28043 
which I think will still be too short, but has got to be better than my
19.5&quot;.  I *know* there is a hi-lift Chinese-made jack out there, I have
seen it by times, just can't find it on the web when I need it :-(

Harbor Freight has one that is nearly perfect! Alas, while it lifts to
30&quot;, it is 54&quot; long and weighs 138 lb... plus it is $150.  Their site is:

Not for tucking under the back seat, but a nice item to drool over :-)
