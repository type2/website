&gt; Don,

&gt; Check out www.roadcow_dot_com to learn more about a good location for the
&gt; radiator. From what I read, the radiator will work in place of the back hatch,
&gt; but roadcow had a better solution. A little more work and it changes the look,
&gt; but the cooling is not a problem. Plus it has fans when stopped. This toyota
&gt; engine has many miles on it and has proven to be reliable.

I'd do that if I didn't have a hitop already. I can't imagine making
this thing any taller... heh

KEP says that electrics aren't enough, and only an engine driven fan
provides enough airflow. I'm thinking about installing a thermostat
controlled electric as a backup as well. Depends on how much room I'll
have with the engine in.
