The archives, it is the best tool/resourse out there. 
Run a search on &quot;tool&quot; and you'd be surprised what you
find!  
Reguarding another FART, I purchased a set of 195/75/14

D rated Yokahamas for my 75 this past weekend.  I like
them so far, I will let you all know if I find them
exceptional or a bust.  Can't wait to do some serious
camping this summer. School is keeping me away from the
Everybus campout, have great fun.  My wife did the scan
of the recent LIMBO and indicated an interest in the
High Mountain campout in NC, any comments or
suggestions.
