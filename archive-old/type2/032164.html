&gt; I'm sure these heaters have their place and are good for their purpose. But
&gt; the advantage of a petrol heater is that they can be used while on the move.
&gt; The use of a propane/butane (LPG) heater while on the move is quite a fire
&gt; risk and in the event of an accident a broken LPG line could shoot a jet of
&gt; LPG onto the the hot exhaust which could ignite with disastrous results.
&gt; Personally while moving I always turn the LPG off at the tank.

--&gt;  All of the other points you made are good, however I have to disagree
a little with you here.  It's true that in an accident a broken LPG line
could cause a fire; however, I think the risk of this is actually lower
than that of fire from a broken gasoline line.  Propane requires a certain
concentration in air to burn, and, being a gas, tends to dissipate.
Gasoline will collect in a puddle and ignites readily in a wide range of
concentrations.

I only make this point because I see so many people who are scared to
death of the idea of running cars on propane.  In reality they only think
gasoline is safer because they're used to it.  If we were switching from
propane to gasoline they'd be terrified of the stuff, and probably rightly
so.

All your other points about the dangers of a catalytic heater in a moving
vehicle are good ones; this thread comes up at least once a winter.
