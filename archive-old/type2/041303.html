&gt; The AIRS site was intended to help the members of this list, and help us

and while I haven't needed it I have always carried the list of the states
I have driven through, and responded as best I could the one or two times
someone gave me a hollar
&gt; 
&gt; I think some people's worries about the site being public are well-founded.
&gt; I would hate to know that some leech was pulling names and selling them to

if you do go public I want off, not because I don't want to help fellow
bus owners, but I get enough garbage on this here machine daily to last a
lifetime

&gt; spam generators and such.  I would almost be tempted to find that person and
&gt; practice the good old southern religious move of &quot;laying on of hands&quot;.

and I will hold em down for you

&gt; Please be patient with us, and give input into how we may resolve this
&gt; issue. 

be careful what you ask for you may get it.

&gt; As always, I am at your service, just rather quiet these days.  I
&gt; said so much for two years I have very little to offer anymore.

and I do appriciate it.

AIRS pages for the states I'm going through
