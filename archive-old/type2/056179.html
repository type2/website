Subject: Clutch slips in only 3rd. gear.

I posted this one to the list many moons ago.  Everyone said my clutch's days
were numbered, so I want to update everyone.

Problem:  My '74 Campmobile's clutch will slip when I'm accelerating, and only
when I reach 3rd. gear.  It usually only does this when it's cold, but
sometimes not.  I accelerate going up a long hill.  1st. gear is fine, shift
to 2nd., no problems, shift to third, and as I give it gas, the rpm's come up
as if it's slipping.  If I back off on the gas a little, the clutch seems to
catch, and I'm fine.

My clutch seems to be adjusted correctly, and I can pass the clutch test in
1st. gear.  I suspect that I have weak springs in my pressure plate.  The
clutch is only a couple of years old, and I've put over 10,000 miles on the
bus since.  I experience no clutch burning smells, and I haven't had to adjust
the clutch since the initial install.

Any one have any thoughts on what my problem may be?  (with my clutch that is)
