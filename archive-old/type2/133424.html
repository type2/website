&gt; &gt;&gt; whats the best and cheapest way to ship a bus tranny?
&gt; &gt; in the back of a friends bus,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; barring that, strap to pallet and contact freight forwarder, about $100
&gt; &gt; coast to coast.
&gt; depends on where to where, but forwardair is good for this sort of thing.

again as said it depends where to where,, I have used Yellow freight with
good results, DHL is new in the business so might be &quot;hungry&quot; also there
are the bus and Amtrak package freight you pick up and drop off but quite
resonable.
