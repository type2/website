Subject: Molding clips
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 1971 Bus which I've been driving a while, and
have finally decided to restore. In gathering parts,
one thing I can't seem to find are the metal clips
that hold the 1&quot;-1.5&quot; wide beltline molding (Specific
to '71 and '72, if I'm not mistaken) in place. Anyone
have a source for these, or should I start fabricating
now?
