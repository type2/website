Subject: Re: [T2] Breaking in an engine (really long :-)

Thanks for thorough comparison!  I didn't know about that article on the
t2 site so I'll go find it.  Also, I found an article on the
aircooled_dot_net site that says the engine should be run at 2500-4000 on
the initial run because 2000 rpms don't properly oil the cam.  hmm..
here's the link:

http://www.aircooled_dot_net/gnrlsite/resource/articles/engnbrkn.htm

Another difference that I noticed between the aircooled and the
motorcycle procedures is that the motorcycle one says never to lug the
engine, and the aircooled_dot_net one says it's ok to lug the engine. 
hmm....

&gt; &gt; It's much different than the &quot;run your engine at 2k for 20 minutes&quot;
&gt; &gt; method...
&gt; 
&gt; Mike,
&gt; 
&gt; I think that it is only different in being more theoretical and less
&gt; procedure oriented.  There are some differences, but they are minor and
&gt; related to the different natures of the vehicles. The discussion of theory
&gt; is solid (brake vs. break aside :-) and valuable for us to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Below, I compare Joe Fournier's procedure in the library to the NTNOA
&gt; page:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From Joe Fournier:
&gt; 
&gt;   1.Immediately upon starting, run engine up to 2000 rpm for 20 minutes.
&gt;     Watch oil pressure and temp gauges. You're letting parts machine
&gt;     themselves to each other for preliminary fit.
&gt; 
&gt;   2.Drain oil while it's hot. Replace before starting again. If time
&gt;     allows, let engine cool and check valves.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From NTNOA:
&gt; 
&gt;     An engine's initial run should be used to bring oil and coolant (air,
&gt;     oil, and/or water) up to operating temperature only, with little or no
&gt;     load, then shut down and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. This
&gt;     is important. After each run the engine needs to completely cool down
&gt;     to ambient temperature.
&gt; 
&gt; My comment:
&gt; 
&gt; Both agree on a no-load run.  To bring a properly tuned and cooled VW
&gt; engine to full temp takes 20 minutes, so they match in that respect.  The
&gt; time would be different for a bike engine which is smaller and has no
&gt; forced air cooling. Really the only difference is the 2K RPM which is not
&gt; spec'ed in the NTNOA article, but is implied elsewhere in the article by
&gt; phrases like, &quot;We must achieve a happy medium where we are pushing on the
&gt; ring hard enough to wear it in but not hard enough to generate enough heat
&gt; to cause glazing.&quot;  I'll bet an inquiry on initial run to those same
&gt; experts would produce a recommendation of close to 2k RPM.
&gt; 
&gt; One flaw in Joe's article is the &quot;if time allows&quot;.  Time *should* be
&gt; allowed!!!  The NTNOA article is correct, IMHO.
&gt; 
&gt; Joe Fournier:
&gt; 
&gt;   3.Inspect drained oil for metal particles. React accordingly; check for
&gt;   magnetic properties to distinguish aluminum and brass from iron.
&gt;   Aluminum = bearings...some wear is expected, but no chunks. Brass =
&gt;   timing gear or valve guides. Shouldn't find much of this, if any.
&gt;   Iron/steel = crank, cam, rings, cylinders.._dot_definitely no chunks, but
&gt;   I'd expect *some* of this in breakin oil.
&gt; 
&gt; NTNOA:
&gt; 
&gt;   Oil change comes much later, read on...
&gt; 
&gt; My comment:
&gt; 
&gt; This may be apples vs. oranges, the load on a &lt;500 lb. bike is way less
&gt; than a 1 ton bus.  The idea of &quot;lightly and gently&quot; for a bus is hard to
&gt; imagine... put it in 1st and you are pushing a ton, no matter what.
&gt; 
&gt; Joe Fournier:
&gt; 
&gt;  4.Run engine for 5-10 miles doing the drive up to 55; then wind
&gt;    (down-shift) down to 20 mph...at least 5 times...as many as 10. You're
&gt;    letting parts further machine themselves to each other with the
&gt;    emphasis being on the cylinders, which must machine themselves under
&gt;    load because their position/geometry is slightly different at different
&gt;    RPMs...thus, the variance in RPMs and the downshifting. I don't fully
&gt;    understand this, but Bob Hoover instructed me to do this and I do it
&gt;    religiously. I consider this as important if not more important that
&gt;    the 20 minute breakin.
&gt; 
&gt; NTNOA:
&gt; 
&gt;   This time give the engine light loads at relatively low rpm and stay
&gt;   out of top gear. Lugging the engine, i.e., low RPM with a lot of
&gt;   throttle (manifold pressure), is more detrimental than high rpm. Another
&gt;   key is too constantly vary engine load during the entire break-in
&gt;   period. A constant load is not ideal for breaking in bearing tolerances.
&gt;   This second run should last only 10-15 minutes before another complete
&gt;   cool down.
&gt; 
&gt; My comment:
&gt; 
&gt; There are definite differences here.  Going to 55 (in 4th, I hope!) then
&gt; slow down vs. light loads and stay out of top gear being the biggest, but
&gt; I think this may be a motorcycle vs. car thing.  MC's have more gears and
&gt; run at higher RPM's.  The times are, however roughly equivalent, if you
&gt; match minutes vs. miles and the constant variation of load is the other
&gt; vital point both articles make.
&gt; 
&gt; Joe Fournier:
&gt; 
&gt;   5.Let sit over night. Check valves.
&gt; 
&gt;     I record all valve settings (per valve) and maintain that information
&gt;     for the first 300 miles. I check and adjust valves at the following
&gt;     times:
&gt; 
&gt;      after 20 minute break-in
&gt;      after 5-10 mile break-in
&gt;      at 25 miles
&gt;      at 50 miles
&gt;      at 150 miles
&gt;      at 300 miles
&gt; 
&gt;     If I notice trends, I check more often. Since work is about 25 miles
&gt;     round trip, I usually get pretty close on these.
&gt; 
&gt; NTNOA:
&gt; 
&gt;   The third run should see slightly higher rpm with light to medium power
&gt;   loading using short bursts of acceleration to help seat the rings. Again
&gt;   10-15 minutes of running should do it and again avoid top gear. A forth
&gt;   run should consist of light to medium engine loads with a few more
&gt;   bursts of medium-high rpm, and lasting just 10-15 minutes varying the
&gt;   engine load and again avoiding top gear. Next while the engine is still
&gt;   warm drain the oil and change the filter. This gets out the new metal
&gt;   particles that are being worn away. Most of the metal particles will
&gt;   break away within the first 50 -75 miles. To ensure the rings seat well,
&gt;   use the same high quality oil and don't be shy about short duration high
&gt;   rpm blasts through the lower gears after the oil has been changed.
&gt; 
&gt;   A few more 15-20 minute sessions should be used to work up to the
&gt;   engine's redline gradually increasing the engine loads. After some
&gt;   definite hard running and 250-500 miles it's a good idea to check the
&gt;   valves.
&gt; 
&gt; My comment:
&gt; 
&gt; Here again there are more similarities than differences.  VW's are very
&gt; sensative to valve adjustment, Nortons may well be less so.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that the Norton's first oil change occurs at ~1-2 hours of run time
&gt; rather than 20 minutes, but the initial oil change occurs rather quickly
&gt; in either case. This is a point of contention among many people I have
&gt; talked to.  Do you leave the initial oil and it's filings in to speed
&gt; break-in or change it to slow it down... intelligent people I respect vary
&gt; on this and I am not sure there is a &quot;correct&quot; answer.
&gt; 
&gt; In either case, you are building the engine up to &quot;normal&quot; operating
&gt; conditions over a series of runs with frequent checks.
&gt; 
&gt; Joe Fournier:
&gt; 
&gt;   6.At 300 miles, pull the engine and retorque the heads. This is a step
&gt;     many people skip, but I'm not inclined to. It will tell you a lot
&gt;     about how your engine is running and is neccessary to assure engine
&gt;     longevity and reliability. It gives you a chance to tighten up tinware
&gt;     and do those things that you meant to do but were in too much of a
&gt;     hurry to do the first time around.
&gt; 
&gt; NTNOA:
&gt; 
&gt; After 500 miles re-torqueing the head is suggested.
&gt; 
&gt; My comment:
&gt; 
&gt; Again, a slight difference in mileage, but not significant.
&gt; 
&gt; In closing:
&gt; All in all, given the apples and oranges nature of the beasts, I would say
&gt; that there are more similarities than differences and if someone told me
&gt; they broke in their VW engine using the NTNOA procedure, I would certainly
&gt; not have any problem with that.
