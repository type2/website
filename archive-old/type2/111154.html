Subject: timing advance question

timing advance question

I have read conflicting repots on where to set the
timing for a vaccum and mechanical advance dizzy
(svda) 

I have read that timing should be set at 32 deg total
mechanical advance with the vacuum hose plugged. 
(unknown engine with degree pulley wheel and
*probably* standard bus cam -t1 1600 in '75 kombi with
34 pict3 carb, had a 009 so the throttle hole in the
butterfly is soldered up, 150 main jet, 1.5mm
decompression rings, ) 
This then lets the vacuum advance the dizzy more than
32 deg total advance at high revs, with a good vacuum
signal. (getting close to 40 deg) I have also read
this is bad. 

If I retard it to 32 deg total advance it has a big
flat spot and idles too low 

At 32 deg mech advance only (vacuum blocked) it ends
up static _at_ tdc. Runs well with heaps of grunt (yeah
who am I kidding its a 1600.....) cannot hear pinging.
Have yet to run for &gt; 15min on the road to see how hot
it gets (oil temp)
