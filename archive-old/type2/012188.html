Subject: engine sounds like a diesel
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com

hi list. the 79 bus i've been looking at makes a
diesel like noise when in lower gears under 30 mph.
once above it 30 mph it goes away.  i went to one
mechanic and he said it was possibly the gears but
couldn't tell for sure without taking the engine
apart.  has anyone else had this type of problem and
can diagnosis it for me? also any leads on a decent
bus in the bay area for less than $2000 would be
appreciated as well. 

thanks,
tesa
