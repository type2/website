    So if I decided to get another nose cone for my '73 002 tranny to
fix my shifting problems, I could stick in the ring and pinion from a
dead 090 I've got and get the higher gear ratios with little problem?
And I could use the bellhousing as well, giving me back the ability to
use non-automatic starters too.
