Subject: rebuild break in, tune up &amp; doink

hi all bus piloteers - i am banking what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
i fought the fight today, but ultimately lost it to the grass pollen.
nothing gets done in june it seems, so its dubly bunk when the rig goes
down and i'm trapped in the valley willamette. before i succumed i managed
time in the engine compartment and returned in with puffy eyes and a giant
question mark over my head. hoping you can help with the question mark.
after 500 miles on the 1600sp rebuild, i thought, then feared it time to
retune it. 009, reconditioned intake manifold, new --&gt; fuel pump, bosch
ignition wires, plugs &amp;points, straight 40 castrol cocktail at 250 miles,
fuel filter, fuel lines, and fan belt. symptom: perfect idle, dwell
remained perfect on the button, lugging had begun at 350 miles becomming
more severe by now. today i pulled it off the track and did my best pit
stop. new fuel filter again, check and recheck valve adjustment, pull and
recondition 30/31pict, double checked dwell, pulled and found a clean fuel
pump screen, and set timing statically. when i hit it with the timing light
i came upon something i'd never seen. the cut mark on the pully was at 4
o'clock and idle was good. (&quot;??!&quot;) it is supposed to be up at the split in
the case, r-r-right?  when i tried to bring the cut mark around to the top
the engine cut out, so i reset it statically, and ran for shelter. was dr.
volks von frankenstein here earlier? i cannot drive this bus. after two
blocks it stammers and clobbers itself back home. any ideas what i am
missing? please send forth wisdom, and thanks in advance - steve
