Subject: '78 camper for sale in Seattle
Message-ID: &lt;19990630004708.43874.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

This time my bus is really for sale. Last time I put on the list I decided 
that I wanted to keep it but now I need the money to go to school. So here 
are the details.

Riviera pop-top camper, 2.0 litre fuel injection, hydraulic lifters 93,000 
mile, runs great, very dependable. I have driven it to Oregon and all over 
here in Washington.

Body is light brown on top, darker brown on bottom(below windows) with 
stripes all the way around. I think it is the Champagne Edition.
Body is in good shape, afew minor scrapes and a tiny bit of rust. Overall 
pretty good.

Interior is in great shape. Full Camper with pop-top, it is a full bed not 
just a cot. Bottom bed can fold out half at a time wich is a nice feature of 
Rivera's over Westies. The sink/closet is behind the driver. The 
stove/fridge is not in it but the propane tank is still underneath. This 
however creates alot of extra space wich is nice.

Overall this bus is in greatshape and runs excellent. I have maintained it 
very well keeping it tuned up. It has been a great camper as well as a daily 
driver. I think somebody will enjoy this bus for along time.

I live in the White Center area of Seattle. You can call me, stop by or I 
can come to you. I'm at 10746 27TH s.w. Seattle, WA (206)431-9023

Thanks,

         Simon King
