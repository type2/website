Subject: Poptop Canvas Installation

I'm about to begin installing the PLF poptop canvas I got last fall.  I've
removed the remnants of the old mildewed tent and will start installing the
very ORANGE replacement top (I can't type in capital letters loud enough to
emphasize just how ORANGE the new top seems compared to the old one - very
cool).  The plastic strips on my current top are shot - in fact, one side of
them bears some strong evidence of a fire in the bus at one time (REPLACE
YOUR FUEL LINES).  Has anyone used strips of vinyl flooring instead of the
stock plastic strips?  Seems the right thickness, etc., and I happen to have
some scraps in the garage.  Any hints/tips for an easy install would be
appreciated.  I can see that getting the correct tension on the canvas is
going to be tough, given that everything seems to be fastened on the side
that is most difficult to reach with tools, and the stapling and other
fastening are best done with the top partially dropped.

Thanks in advance,
