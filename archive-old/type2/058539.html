&gt; would not be too hard (for someone who knows what they are doing) to make
&gt; a circuit board and plug, and write a simple program in basic, that could
&gt; install in an old PC/XT or similar. Ideally it would start the diagnostic
&gt; on boot, then print. No monitor or keyboard. That would save one of those
&gt; preposterous aluminum cast PC cases from the junkyard and a matrix
&gt; printer too.


    I recall seeing these for sale sometime back in HVW&amp;DB. Don't know
if they are still available. Seems like the price was around $500.
