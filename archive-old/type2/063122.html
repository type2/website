&gt;A smart road is in between.  If I were brushing a product containing
&gt;them out of a can, I'd hardly worry about more than a quality filter sty=
le
&gt;respirator, with organic vapor cartrige.  For occasional spraying with t=
hem I have
&gt;used such a mask in fact though usually use a better mask from the local=

&gt;paint shop custom made for the purpose (refill inserts about $40 a pop)

I bought an excellent cartridge style respirator rated for organic vapor =
for
about $20 at our local Quality Farm and Fleet store. If you really want t=
o go
for the maximum protection, they have one for about $40 that was rated fo=
r use
with pesticides (yuckk! can you say carcinogens?). Replacement cartridges=
 were
very resonably priced. They also had a nice selection of spray guns, comp=
ressors,
sand blasters, ect. Matter of fact, their $20 spray gun did a very nice j=
ob on
a boat I painted this summer. I used an etching primer, and needed the re=
spirator too.
