Subject: Re: [T2] What is it with the 009?

Ihaven't had any problems with the vacuum dizzy since I've never had it in.
That's why I want to install it for a comparison. Who knows? I might find
it's my new favorite.

&gt;What problems have you had with the vacuum advance?  You could just
&gt;disconnect the vacuum line and then you've got the same thing as an
&gt;009.  If you've still got problems, then something's wrong with the
&gt;centrifugal advance, not the vacuum.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Before I go on, Thomas Tarka's post about his 009 is prompting me to
write
&gt;&gt; this&gt;snip&lt;Why is everyone thinking that an 009 is better?  I don't get
it,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't get it either, but from the other direction. I am running an 009
on
&gt;&gt; my 74 1.8ltr and it does quite well. Good power and acceleration, no
&gt;&gt; unexpected trouble on hills, etc, etc. I am planning to re-install the
stock
&gt;&gt; vacuum dizzy after I repair my carb to make a comparison, so maybe then
I'll
&gt;&gt; understand.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My thinking is that while the 009 may not be perfect, I have never failed
to
&gt;&gt; get an air cooled VW to run with one. Can't say the same for the vacuum
&gt;&gt; dizzies, but my experience may be somewhat limited.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My two kroner worth.
