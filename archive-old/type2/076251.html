Subject: Re: [T2] Which meter to buy

Sean:

I got a nice general purpose multi-meter (volts, ohms, amps) at Radio Shack
several years ago for something like $30 or so, and it's worked just fine.
It has nice long leads, a small, swing-out wire &quot;stand&quot; that allows me to
set it upright, and a large, clear readout that's easy to see.

I use it once or twice a year on my '81, I'm careful with it (no greasy
hands, no dropping down into the engine, etc.) and I expect it'll last as
long as I care to use it.

You can spend a heck of a lot more for these items, but unless you're using
a multi-meter every day, why bother?

Subject: [T2] Which meter to buy


&gt; Well I want to buy a meter (Ohm/ammeter ?) to help troubleshoot problems I
&gt; might have with FI, wiring, instruments, AFM, ECU. Does anyone have any
&gt; preferences/suggestions on which one to get? Please explain why you prefer
&gt; it (sorry, I want the reason why you like it too). This will be for my
1980
&gt; Westy primarily.
&gt;
&gt; I was looking at some nice units at a new Checker Auto Parts just down the
&gt; street.
