&gt;Around that time of year(October?) is oyster season in these here parts
&gt;ie: Maryland.  It is actually a pleasant experience to camp at Asseteaque
&gt;National Seashore (less bugs) and taking the thirty minute trip to
&gt;Chincoteaque for a bushel of oysters $30 - $45 to roast and to slurp.
&gt;You get to see wild horses and can fish and catch mussels.  I 'll spring
&gt;for at least a bushel of oysters even if we choose an alternate spot.  So
&gt;if someone wants to organize it or needs assistance, I'm in like Flynn.

Ha, Ha, Patrick, In like Flynn Indeeed!

Actually, this sounds like quite an adventure. I would be willing
to try out the westy bed that I picked up at the Bugout
and give it a shot. Order a bushel of oysters for me, 
and you guys get some too!
