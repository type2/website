Hi Volks!

My latest baby, a first-owner '74 Kombi from Delmenhorst (Germany),
came home to Braunschweig last Saturday.  78k original kilometres,
everything original, some rust, some welding, but nice.  And it 
came with all the goodies: sales contract and license from '74, 
all TÜV reports since, drawings for the company inscriptions they
planned to have painted on it back then, everything.  (The inscriptions
themselves need to be restored though.)  Colour is orange, name is
&quot;Delzy&quot; from the original number plates DEL-ZY 51.

The drive home was agreeable enough once I'd left the Autobahn.  The
old bus didn't feel like going faster than 80 km/h (50 mph) without
getting noisy, so I decided to baby it until the oil gets changed
and the ignition system overhauled.  Other than lack of top end
power, it drives nicely though.  Except for the brakes, which feel
soft and produce a distinct rumble from the rear.  Fuel consumption
is a bit high, around 11 litres per 100 kilometres instead of the
9 that I expected from my other Buses.  Time for the ignition
check indeed.

A bit of work on the brakes, maybe a couple of hours of welding,
and hopefully I'll pass TÜV in March.  All that for 700 DM (which
is less than US$ 350) -- I really cannot complain.  I already feel
home in it, too.

Speaking of homes, I also reached agreement on the '78 Westy I
co-own with an ex co-worker: since he doesn't have the time anymore,
we split the thing fairly: I get the bus, he gets the stereo.
Ooof.  Up one and a half Buses in two days, to a total of five
and a half.  Well, I can't say I haven't been warned.  Any of the
Germans on the List need a Westy project?  For details p-mail.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
