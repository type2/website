Hi Folks,

Since it's Friday, and since the (original) type2 server seems to be up, I 
thought I'd pass along the URL to my new website, which features Sweet Pea, 
my 1979 Westy.  Some of the pics are large, so give them a few extra seconds 
to load.

The URL is http://www.jzupper_dot_com/sweetpea.htm

Thanks again for all the helpful info.  FWIW, I've found that if you adjust 
the mezner screw on your hoover bit about 3 turns, your Bus runs a lot 
better.  Use a 7.5mm double-square socket....
