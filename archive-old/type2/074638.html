Subject: Re: [T2] *sigh*

Mmmm, sounds like trouble, Beth.
Like my Camper that had a little rust in the floor
until we left it a couple of months.
Then we had rust in the drivers step,wheel arches,
passenger floor &amp; step, front apron, drivers side
skirts and cargo floor and windscreen.
And we don't even know what's going on with the
engine, which could be VERY costly to replace or
repair if it's a 1700,1800 or 2litre.
If your &quot;friend&quot; has such little disregard for the
upkeep of her bus I'd say it probably is worth a LOT
less than the storage fees.
Good luck...but don't hold your breath:-/
Let's hope someone comes along that'll give it the
respect it deserves.
Cheers
Andrew

&gt; Be warned... this is a sad story of bus abuse. The
&gt; names have been changed
&gt; to protect the guilty.....
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of a friend has a pretty nice 1978
&gt; transporter. Very nice rust
&gt; free body (at least for the east coast) and the
&gt; interior isn't bad
&gt; either...
&gt; 
&gt; Now, said person is realllly harsh on her bus. It's
&gt; been towed god knows
&gt; how many times because she couldn't move it for
&gt; various reasons (blown
&gt; starter, blown *fuse*) all basically easy repairs
&gt; that she neglected to
&gt; do. And if you've ever seen a major east coast
&gt; city's towing crew there is
&gt; no way in hell you'd let one near a nice bus. Hell,
&gt; I'd never let them
&gt; near a crappy bus. They're not the most graceful of
&gt; people when it comes
&gt; to illegally parked cars.
&gt; 
&gt; Said friend takes bus on a 500 mile trip to North
&gt; Carolina. Notices she's
&gt; low on oil while down in NC. Fills it up with oil.
&gt; Drives back up. Bus
&gt; stalls on the way. Notices she has no more oil in
&gt; the engine. Fills it up
&gt; again. Makes it to Virginia before it stalls again.
&gt; Cripples it to a
&gt; hotel. Opens the engine compartment. Oil is
&gt; *EVERYWHERE*. She forgot to
&gt; put the oil cap back on, so she claims. Pours in
&gt; more oil. Turns it over.
&gt; (yes, i know, I was waiting to hear the word &quot;major
&gt; fire&quot; right about at
&gt; this point too. Fortunately it didn't happen.) Oil
&gt; is pouring out of the
&gt; passenger side of the engine. She says it's near the
&gt; valve cover. Who
&gt; knows?
&gt; 
&gt; So, ok, I'm listening to this and am just horrified
&gt; (but trying not to
&gt; show it). What she says next though made me want to
&gt; cry...
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of getting it to hell, even a vw dealer, for
&gt; what could be a
&gt; pretty simple fix (or a not so simple), she leaves
&gt; it in the hotel parking
&gt; lot and treks back up north by calling a friend to
&gt; pick her up.
&gt; 
&gt; And leaves the bus in Virginia.
&gt; 
&gt; For what must now be 3 weeks at least.
&gt; 
&gt; And, that's right, you guessed it, the hotel tows
&gt; the bus. And she's mad
&gt; about it.
&gt; 
&gt; So, ok, the conclusion of the story of the battered
&gt; and abused bus that
&gt; shouldn't have been battered and abused.
&gt; 
&gt; The bus is *somewhere* in a Fredricksburg Va tow
&gt; yard. I don't know where,
&gt; exactly, i'll have more details tonight or tomorrow.
&gt; I have no idea what
&gt; is wrong with it, engine wise, since i didn't look
&gt; at it. Body wise, it's
&gt; pretty damn good. She wanted to know if anyone (me
&gt; specifically) wants to
&gt; buy it. I told her that the storage fees alone might
&gt; be around about what
&gt; it's worth (not only that but I have too many
&gt; projects right now). I'm
&gt; fairly certain she'll hand it over to someone who is
&gt; willing to get it out
&gt; of storage. I'll talk to her tonight and try to get
&gt; more details.
&gt; 
&gt; So, yeah, anyone want to deal with a *VERY* flakey
&gt; kid who should have
&gt; *never* owned a 22 year old bus in order to get a
&gt; shot at something that
&gt; might or might not be an easy fix? ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, if anyone is interested in it let me know.
