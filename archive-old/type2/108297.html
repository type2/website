Subject: RE: [T2] Suspension Clunk

My suspension clunk turned out to be a broken front sway bar that had been
that way since before I bought the bus.  Look very closely near the sway bar
brackets.  My break was actually inside the bushing; very hard to spot.
Symptom was clunking and excessive vehicle sway when turning in one
direction only. I replaced it with the larger diameter aftermarket bar.

&lt;SNIP&gt;
In the ongoing quest to improve my '78 Westfalia's handling, I have replaced
the shocks with KYBs, the tires with BF Goodrich All Terrain tires, and
replaced the steering dampener. My wheel bearings have always felt a bit
loose, so I replaced the rear wheel bearings (which turned out to be not
nearly as difficult as I had anticipated) and adjusted the front ones. Now
there is no play in the wheels, aside from very slight play in the rear
left. It handles better, with less &quot;yaw&quot; when I drive, but the clunking I
hear when I go over bumps that I thought was the loose wheel bearings is
still there. It is coming from the front right wheel area, and also from
somewhere in the rear. What else in the suspension could be causing this
clunking? Could it be my motor mounts? How would I tell? It is very loud and
distracting, and the handling is still not tip top (whatever tip top for a
bus means).

P.S. Has anybody had a chance to check out How to Modify Volkswagen Bus
Suspension, Brakes and Chassis for High Performance by James Hale yet? I've
got it on order and I'll give a report when I get it.
