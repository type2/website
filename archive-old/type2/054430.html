Subject: Looking for a good, reasonable body &amp; paint shop in San Jose

The title pretty much says it all. I need a good body &amp; paint shop to take
all the dings and dents out of a bus and put good quality paint job on it.
Preferrably without having to give up my first born son.

San Jose or San Cruz area.
