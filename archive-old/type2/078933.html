Subject: I need a short course on lifters.

I bought the Wilson book and found that mine are flat (no light between). I
wonder why there is nothing in the Bentley about that? Anyway, I have been
told by Dave E that if I buy new lifters, I need a new cam. I have to get
reground lifters? What's up with that? Are they readily available? What else
do I need to know?
