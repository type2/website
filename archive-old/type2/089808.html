Subject: Re: [T2] Re:76 can't have hydraulics if original

Sure it could have them,
I put hydaulics in my 74, at 32,000 miles     ( original )
So it is a modified ( for the better) orignal engine--that's all.
If the Bus is a late model 76 is could very well have hydraulics--
Anything is possible--:&gt;)

Later,

E-mail message   
  
Regarding the 76 bus and why I said it couldn't have had hydraulics-, I
said this because he implied it had its original engine: 
Vanagon man wrote: 
&quot;The motor is a type 4, 2l with hydro lifters. It only has 50,000 actual
miles on it, not rebuilt and not removed from the bus since it's
original 
installation.&quot; 
Totally possible someone did a motor swap and put a 2liter in the bus...
Rare to find original engines in these old cars.
