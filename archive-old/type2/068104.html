&gt; Thanks to all who responded to my rant on welding. It's nice to know there
&gt; are virtual shoulders out there on which to lean when things don't go the
&gt; way you'd like.
&gt; 
&gt; I spent the better part of last night hooking up my gas on the Lincoln.
&gt; Finally, late at night, I made my first MIG weld. Damned if it isn't a whole
&gt; new world. Instead of hissing, spitting and burning nearly out of control
&gt; like the flux core wire, the MIG is a placid, beautiful green flame that
&gt; seems perfectly happy to join two pieces of sheet metal in holy matrimony :)
&gt; The first time I touched electrode to metal, my spirits soared. Thoughts of
&gt; my 70 Westy humming along the highway crowded my head. Yes, I told myself,
&gt; by this time next summer, we'll be peacefully camped in Door County
&gt; (Wisconsin), top popped, beer in similar state, fresh fish on the Coleman
&gt; simulating the sound of a MIG electrode with the proper stick out...
&gt; 
&gt; Not quite there yet. My welds look a little beady. A good weld is a thing of
&gt; beauty. Mine so far are a thing of utility. Practice, practice, practice
&gt; before I takle that rusty window, and those holes in the cargo floor. Oh
&gt; yeah, and that rusted out rear fender panel. And those coupla holes where
&gt; the driver's feet go, etc.

I thought those holes were there to let the water out! Now I got
something else to fix ;&gt;)
