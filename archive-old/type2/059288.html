Subject: brocks magazine

Is brocks vwmagazine a comercial site? - if so is it appropriate to
advertise it in this group? - should the advertising be reserved for
fridays? - i must confess to being in the dark about what the 'rules'
should be here - but it would seem that allowing commercial sites to
advertise might be better left to fridays if at all - but hey - what do
i know?
