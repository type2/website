&gt; I have a flywheel with a bunch of short hairline cracks visible. The
&gt; cracks are no longer than a centimeter in length. They all extend
&gt; radially on the shiny portion of the flywheel. Should the flywheel be
&gt; replaced? Turned? Ignored? :)


If these are really cracks i'd scrap the flywheel.
