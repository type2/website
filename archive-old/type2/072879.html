&gt;MX-446 - transform rear deck into huge multi-segmented tool box with planks

Hey, I did that too.  Looked nice, kept expensive things outta the sight of
thieves... weighed a TON!
Finally junked it when I snagged an arm on an exposed screw while digging
for the distributor that kept rolling around under there.
Now the bus interior is about 20 db louder, sits around 6&quot; higher  :)

I'm gonna have my TIG friend fab me a new one outta aluminum; then I just
have to worry about the tin-can people busting my windows to recycle it.
