Subject: Blue Bus

&quot;The Blue Bus is calling us...&quot;

-Jim Morrison

Remember Buses on the Blue Ridge?

LET'S DO THAT AGAIN!

There will be a gathering of buses at the Mount Pisgah Campground.

http://www.nps_dot_gov/archive/blri/pisgah.htm

Loop D has historically been the area where buses converge.

The event is planned for the weekend of October 26th, 27th, and 28th.  This is
the last weekend that the campground is open.  Sites are first come, first
served.  I think they are $19 apiece.

It will be cold, especially at night, so be prepared.  Bring firewood.

There is no electricity or showers - cold running water only.

The last Buses on the Blue Ridge was 1998.  My daughter was 4 at the time.
Now she is 14 and she's putting me up to this.  :)
