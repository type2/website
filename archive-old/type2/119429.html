Subject: Re: [T2] Tranny to engine bolt 78 engine

Snoopy

Usually this indicates you previously had the 002 bellhousing, that uses
the SR17 starter
and you are installing a 091 bellhousing that takes the longer bolts and
uses the SR87 starter for the 228mm flywheel.

You better make sure your starter is going to engage your flywheel.

&gt; I was going camping this weekend and my tranny went bad about an hour
out of
&gt; town.  73 bus with 78 2l engine., I am trying to use a spare tranny I had
&gt; (thinking it is also a 78) but the top tranny to engine bolt and the &quot;D&quot;
&gt; head starter bolt are too short.
