Eric, and the other 1000 folks on the list too,
   To get those screws out can sometimes be a real bear of a job.  To 
increase your chances of success there are a couple of things to do.   
First, make sure the area around the head of the screw is clean as you can 
get it.  Next, clean out the screwdriver slots before you even try to loosen 
the screws.  Now, just a little penetrating oil on the screws.  OK, now hold 
your starter/solenoid in a vice that is well mounted and make sure you have 
good access to the screw heads.  Time for the trick that will get the screws 
out, HEAT the area of the starter that the screws thread into.  I use an 
electric heat gun and make that area too hot to touch.  Then I use a large 
screwdriver that has hex flats just below the handle, and a 6 point box 
wrench on the flats to loosen the screws.  Really lean into the screwdriver 
as hard as you can,so it won't skip in the screw slots, and apply the 
turning force with the wrench.  I find it easiest if the starter is mounted 
so that the screwdriver can be held horizontally.
   The real magic is the heat.  I've done a few peoples starters, and this 
method has never failed me.  While you've got the starter out and on the 
bench why not do a complete disassembly, cleaning, inspection, repair as 
neccessary, and reassembly.  It's really not hard, and in my opinion, 
prevents the dreaded hot start problem.  Of course YMMV.
