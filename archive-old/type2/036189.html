Subject: rebuilt starter question

Hi ya'll-

I'm looking at maybe buying a rebuilt starter
for my 77 Loaf.  Do these typically include
the solenoid as well?

My starter currently stays engaged,even after
the key is switched back to off. I have to
disconnect the battery to get it
to kick out.
 
I recently replaced just the solenoid, which
worked for a while, and this problem arose.
So I'm thinking a whole &quot;new&quot; unit would be the
way to go.  I can't think of anything other
than a malfunctioning solenoid that would
cause this to happen. (I have an aftermarket
push button start switch, like an airplane,
so I don't think it's related to that.)
 
thanks much

matt
