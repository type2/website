Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Calif. &amp; Ariz. Emissions Laws - What's the latest?

Not sure where California fits into that picture...

But, as of 1/1/03, 1974 buses no longer have to suffer emissions
tests, although later buses in some counties (SF comes to mind) will
soon have to undergo dyno tests. (for emissions, not power)

&gt; Regarding AridZona Emissions law--
&gt; At present it is required that all vehicles 1967 and newer pass
&gt; emissions--BUT ! There is a law being past that IF your car is 15 years of
&gt; age or Older -- AND you have Classic Car insurance -- You will NOT have to
&gt; go through Emissions--At present this bill has Passed through AridZona and
&gt; it is waiting to be signed by the EPA--
