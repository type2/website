Subject: LEDs in the dash (was '69 electrical FIXED!!)

All,

After a few listee's comments on replacing dashlights
with LED's (apparently a 'Hooverism'), I went to Radio
Shack and checked out the various options.

12v LEDs do exist, but they only have them in amber,
red, and green....no clear. They have clear in 2v, but
I figure that'd be way too dim. It seemed like the
colored LEDs were in a colored-housing, and might have
a clear diode, so I bought a couple to try out....

Well, it was indeed a colored housing, but the diode
was colored too:-(

Also, I compared the OEM light vs. the LED, and the
OEM was *MUCH* brighter...bummer. If anyone has any
other suggestions; I'm all ears.


Still, having replaced the single bulb that was
burned-out (I'd really hoped there were *several*;-),
my dash lights up to a reasonable level. I guess I'll
just have to dim the VDO tach (now mounted where the
clock goes in the guage cluster) so that it doesn't
overpower the other guages.... Oh, well.


Thanks for everybody's help, I appreciate it!
