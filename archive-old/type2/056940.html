It was funny to see your post today about sunroofs.  This morning I decided to
fix the sunroof on my '76.  Same thing it was bolted down and caulked up.

Mine has two pieces, the external part, and a separate interior piece that
runs on a separate track.  After some effort I got the interior part to slide
all the way back exposing the under side of the top piece, which hadn't moved
at all.  I finally just took out all the bolts and took the entire thing off.
The rails are aluminum, so they aren't rusted, but the outside of the top
piece was covered in rust and scratches (from sliding back) and the rust from
this had run down through the seals, and gotten into the rails.  There's a
worm gear that goes through the rails, and it was completely gunked up with
old grease, dirt and this rust runoff.  After a few hours, gallons of liquid
wrench, and millions of Q-tips I got it all cleaned out.  I'm going to repaint
the top panel before I put it all back together, but at least the cable can
run smoothly through the rails.  I'll let you know what happens when I get it
all back together.  If nothing else it won't be any problem to bolt it back
down and recaulk it, which it badly needed.
