Subject: Re: [T2] To Sump Or Not To Sump?

A caution should be noted. If you use the vehicle for short run commuting, 
the motor will take longer to fully warm up. In this case, monitor the 
condition of the oil. If it smells of gas or gets milky, change it and note 
the mileage. You will get a margin more of use from the extra capacity, but 
a higer rate of contamination, so I wouldn't use one if that was the 
primary use.

For Westies climbing mountain grades it makes good sense, understanding 
that ground clearance is reduced and a steel plate should be fabricated to 
protect from disaster, and fabricated such that it promotes air flow over 
the pan so it doesn't reduce the cooling, but enhances it.

If your running hot due to out of spec timing/mixture or clogged fins, the 
extra capacity pan won't solve the problem. But for spec running engines 
under high temp stresses they can extend the life of the oil by keeping 
temps lower. The pan is a much better way to reduce heat because it doesn't 
create any more load on the pump to push through the lines to an aux. 
cooler with the resulting volume and pressure drop at the bearings.
