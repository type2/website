hello,

this isnt exactly &quot;at the same time&quot; but i have seen CB's at truckstops
that has a button for 19.  You set your dial to 2, and then when you
want to check 19 you hit the button.  When you are sick of 19, you hit the
button again and the CB goes back to the previously tuned channel.  2 in
this case.

peas,

Steve
