&gt; Hello all,
&gt;  I am stumped on this ,,
&gt;  I just added a dog house oil cooler(new) and an
&gt; alternator to the 1500 singleport in my 68 .
&gt; ... the oil cooler is new an the mounts oil
&gt; passages are unobstructed.


Are you sure?  There are a variety of washers for this application,  I
think that the proper washers are the flatter ones for the 1500 case to a
Doghouse cooler.

Also, are you running the proper fan for the doghouse shroud, and is its
clearance properly adjusted?
