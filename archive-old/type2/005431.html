I haven't seen the bug on bus combo.  Sounds pretty cool.  You could have
the poptop room without the leaks if the weld job was done right.  Although,
as someone mentioned, all that steel &amp; glass up there has got to be taxing
on the suspension &amp; very top-heavy.  While I was living in Jackson, WY the
Rainbow Family of Living Light came through the area (about 10,000 hippies &amp;
wannabees who, no kidding, would wash their hair in the supermarket produce
section.  They'd wait for the spray to come on &amp; there goes all that who
knows what all over your fresh lettuce.  Proclaiming environmental purism
all the way they illegally camped out in a national forest leaving gigantic
piles of trash &amp; starting a forest fire which they then blocked fire
equipment from getting in to because &quot;that's the way nature cleanses
itself.&quot;)  Anyway, my wife &amp; I were taking a 9 year old kid to a local hot
spring where it was known that people had left their tropical fish which had
flourished &amp; were free aquarium starters.  When we got there, there was a
&quot;clan?&quot; of about 11 completely naked bathing Rainbows camped out there in
their 69 Chevy bus which had a Transporter greenhouse welded to the top.
They said they slept up there.
