Subject: 70 Trans - a bit wordy sorry

I am trying to figure out if my trans is shot.
Since I got it on the road in April, it has never really wanted to go into
or stay in third.
Now it doesn't seem to want to be in first.
Downshifting is becoming non existent.

I checked the GL4 fluid and it was maybe a pint low, not bad after 9k miles.
It appears to be leaking out from where the CV connects.

I see that one of the rubber or plastic inserts is missing on the shift rod
by the nose cone.
I know that is not good, but I don't believe that is what's causing my
problem.
Is it??

I believe it is time to replace it, what do y'all think?
I use Ma Cherie' for work and I travel about 1-2k miles a month.
I know some will say that I shouldn't do that, Blah, Blah, Blah. But that is
my only option I can afford.

Also, where is the best place to get a new trans?

Lastly, if I do replace the trans, I sure would love some help as I have
never pulled one before.
Later,
Jim
