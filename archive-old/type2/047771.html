Subject: Fw: [T2] Too much gas?

Nathan- you will not be able to floor the pedal, and probably snap the cable trying.
have someone floor the pedal first, and look at the carb linkage. is it fully open?
or is there room to turn the butterfly, and can it be adjusted to do that with the
pedal as it is now ? That should be simple enough to resolve the question...
full pedal on the freeway ? go for it...

&gt;I have a 74 bus, and I was was wondering if the tab on the gas pedal that 
&gt;keeps you from pushing the pedal all the way down is necessary? I have a 
&gt;tachometer so I know I won't over rev, but I would like to be able to stay 
&gt;above 60 on a hill when I have to drive on the interstate with people going 
&gt;75 behind me. So basically I want to know if I removed this, could I give 
&gt;the engine too much gas? I am running dual kadrons if that makes a 
&gt;difference.
