Subject: Re: [T2] The ramifications of high crankcase pressure

[...]

&gt;
&gt; There isn't a problem with the oil pressure. The gauge reads about 4-5
&gt; bars of pressure (60-70 PSI) when then engine is cold, eventually
&gt; dropping to about 1.5 bar during extended highway runs.  But it doesn't
&gt; hardly leak at all when it's cold, even though the pressure is a lot
&gt; higher.
&gt;


Whoa!  The 60 to 70 lbs DOES sound high.  The spring is suppossed to kick in
at 55 lbs or so....could be inaccuracy of the gauge, no telling,  I test my
motors on the stand for oil pressure, and with all the bells and whistles
have not had one hit 70 lbs, ever.
