Subject: Re: [T2] Oil Cooler Cleaning?

Chris.
In the six Westies with Type IV engines I've had over the last eight
years I've found that many have the top side of the oil cooler stopped up
with everything from disintegrated cigarette filters to just plain grass
clippings. Once the cooler collects a light coating of oil things just
seem to cling after that. If the flapper over the oil cooler is tied down
(thermostat absent) it keeps stuff trapped and it doesn't have a chance
to blow on off.
Many times the timing is the cause for overheating, on the Type IV
engines it needs to be set properly.
Tuning the engines to lean running to pass state inspections can cause
over heating with detonation and eventually dropped valve seats.
I've found that closely monitoring the spark plugs for a few hundred
miles will enable you to adjust the AFM to get a light chocolate color on
the plugs and this procedure has worked for me in getting as much as 140K
out of an engine and the heads were still in very good condition.
I wouldn't totaly ignore the condition of the oil cooler, I've seen
coolers that evidenced a fair amount of crushing in the outward end that
might be the culprit.
I've never cut a Type 4 cooler open to investigate how much this might
effect the cooling but any damage is cause to replace the oil cooler.
In the very least the cooler should be removed, cleaned because sludge
build up will cause the oil to just bypass back to the sump, skipping the
cooler completely.

&gt; On a Type IV I mean blow it upwards not down.
&gt; 
&gt; Certainly worth the .50 cents or buck that the car wash charges.
