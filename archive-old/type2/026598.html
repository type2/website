Subject: Parking Brakes Stuck!!!

X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

And now for an entirely new problem.  As many of you know, I went through a
frustrating time last week trying to get my engine to work on all 4
cylinders (see previous posts for gory details).  Anyway, I fixed the
problem Saturday, and experienced a feeling of euphoria as I was finally
able to drive my bus under full power.  So I drove around town all afternoon
in the rain.  This morning, I went to start the engine for my commute to
work, and it started and idled very nicely.  When it warmed up, I released
the parking brake, put it in first, and gave it some gas.  Much to my
chagrin, the bus didn't move.  It lurched forward slightly every time I gave
it gas, but it was stuck in place.  It became apparent to me that the
parking brake was stuck.  I tried moving the brake handle back and forth,
hoping to release something that was stuck, but nothing has happened.  Also,
when I release the handle, it doesn't seem to spring forward with the same
force as it did before.

Is it possible for something to happen in 36 hours that would cause the
parking brakes to stick?? I was driving in the rain, so could it be rust??
I need to be able to drive my bus to work, because if I can't, I end up
driving my mother-in-law's car, which is an '83 champagne pink Corolla.
HELP!!!!
