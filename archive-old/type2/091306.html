&gt; &gt;the rubber grommet part of the nipple that secured them to the tray holes
&gt; &gt;acted as a raised point that prevented all of the water from freely flowing
&gt; &gt;out and off of the trays.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just having plain open holes will actually allow for better pan draining,
&gt; &gt;in my opinion.
&gt;
&gt; So why did VW put them there?  I think the idea was that the grommets would allow the water to wick out via capillary action; without them you have
&gt; a hole through which more water and dirt can enter.  Not absolutely sure of that, but generally I try to replace the plugs when I can.  You can often
&gt; find reasonably non-dried ones in junkyard cars.

For the short term, I think the grommets are good but, as Bob says they do
allow liquid to remain and in the long term they might be a rust source.
If the paint around the hole is undisturbed (and it probably will be) a
little liquid buildup won't damage anything.

I think that VW put them there to limit the amount of air (and dust)
sucked into the engine bay.
