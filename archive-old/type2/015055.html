Nick:
The following are the events that I know of:

1. Air Affair, Sunday, March 11th, at Volks Authority, Stockton St. San
Jose, Ca. (I believe this is the first one, This is a well respected VW
shop and should be worth while going to IMHO.

2. VVCA Spring meet, Sunday April 22, San Jose Historical Museum at Kelley
Park in San Jose. (This is a must attend show/swap, stock, custom Type
1,2,3's of all kinds plus the best swap meet this side of Sacramento!).

3. Bug-O-Rama 47, Sacramento Race Way, Sacramento Ca., (the grand daddy of
Nor Cal shows, show, big swap meet and drag racing. Fine show if your not
showing your vehicle(it's lost a lot of it's grass roots type of
personality over the years and fair judgemanship, of course this is just my
bitter opinion).

4. Vallejo usually has a show around August, but in the last few years it
has not been an annual thing, some times the &quot;Good Guys&quot; a car show
promoting concern puts it on and sometimes not. They used to also put on a
great show at Pleasanton fairground but not for awhile, I heard it is going
on this year but not sure when.

Check with your local VW shop or VVCA (Vintage Volk. Club of America)golden
gate chapter web site, they are a good source of info.  Hope this helps. PS
If anyone finds a discrepancy with this info please correct!

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I was just wondering if there are any Bus/VW shows in the near future in
&gt;Northern California.  Is there a good website that lists upcoming shows?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
