Subject: FREE 68 SQUAREBACK IN WASHINGTON!!! (sorry, no bus content, but
  this is an emergency)

my aunt has a squareback on orcas island that the owner of the property
MUST get rid of. she cant find anyone to take it or it will go to the
crusher. thing is, it was rolled over... dont ask me how... i think the
body, aside from the roof, is still good... it has been a LONG time since
i saw it, so i dont remember. if i remember correctly, she said the
engine was newly rebuilt at the time of the wreck, and she even drove it
to the island to park it, but that was years ago, so no telling what
shape the engine is in now. i dont know anything about squarebacks, other
than the fact that i would like to have one, but she did say something
about it being a pancake engine... i would assume all 'backs would have
had pancakes due to the style of the body... but like i said, i dont know
anything about them.

anyway, the owner of the property where it has been sitting is trying to
use the property as collateral for a loan and has to clean it up. she has
tried to find anyone on the island to take it, but no one wants it and i
hate to see a classic VW go to the scrap... it is red and it's name is
otto... or auto, not sure which... p-mail me if you can help us out,
thanks! i would take it but i live in OK and it would cost me more than i
can afford to get it home...

i would post it on the samba, but i dont have internet access at this
time...

thanks for your time and i hope this poor thing doesnt get crushed,
chris
