&gt;We'll, I broke out the digital multimeter with

&gt;kill it?
&gt;
&gt;Are there any multimeter for dummies pages out
&gt;there?  I really have NO CLUE what to do with
&gt;this thing?  I don't really even know what some
&gt;of the symbols mean.  Kind of explains my
&gt;aversion to FI, right?

Don't meters come with manuals anymore?
Anyway here are 3 meters from $5 to $20.
I'd think that any of them would tell you if you have a ground or how many
volts you have at a terminal or the resistance of a spark plug wire and at
ten bucks you can afford an extra for the next time you cross the wires.
