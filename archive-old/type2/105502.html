Hi Bob,

Jamie Rivers carries his &quot;Blue Sky&quot; tarp poles this way on the drivers 
side of his 74 westy. It keeps them outside the vehicle and the center 
of gravity is nice and low for better handling. You can see the poles 
enroute to EveryBus 2002 in this pic:

Happy trails,

&gt;&gt; BTW, if you carry sheet goods a lot, you can make hooks that slide 
&gt;&gt; into
&gt;&gt; the jack points.  These hold the sheet goods upright against the side 
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; the bus.  Tie-down straps attach to the hooks and extend up to hook 
&gt;&gt; over
&gt;&gt; the drip rail to secure the load.  Much more convenient than trying 
&gt;&gt; to fit
&gt;&gt; the sheets inside.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; hmmmmmm   never seen these, sounds like a slick idea...not sure what 
&gt; kind
&gt; of shape my jack points are in either since I never use em.
