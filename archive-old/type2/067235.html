Subject: BA4/BA6 gas heaters  (longish)

I agree with Chris (&quot;QUIT BLASTING THE GAS HEATERS!&quot;) that a properly 
installed BA6 gas heater (factory optional from '74 thru the water-cooled 
Vanagon) is both sufficient and safe for heating a bus.  A while back I 
bought one at a junkyard and put it in my '77 Westy.  It delivered plenty 
of heat, relatively quickly. It was also perfectly safe to use, both while 
driving and while camping.  In fact, the dash control has a built-in timer 
that is specifically meant for use while the bus is shut off, and allows 
you to turn the heater on long enough to warm the bus, after which it shuts 
off automatically.  

The negatives? Well, if you're going to run it while camping (with the 
engine off) for a lot of time, you will need a second battery. Also, 
installation is somewhat time-consuming, assuming you use all of the 
sensors, relays, etc. that make it so safe (and you should!).  And new 
replacement parts are either incredibly expensive or nonexistent.  On the 
other hand, if you locate a cheap used one you could have excellent heat 
for very little investment.  

John Anderson mentioned using a BA4 heater from a Type 4.  This heater is 
virtually identical to the BA6, except that the smaller furnace puts out 
slightly less heat.  I put one in my bus before I found the BA6 at the 
junkyard.  When I found the BA6, I was able to use all the BA4 wiring, 
sensors, dash control, and fuel pump that I'd already installed.  While I 
preferred the BA6, the BA4 was certainly sufficient, and somewhat easier to 
find since every type 4 came with one.  
(By the way, I do have a fairly complete BA4 for sale, if anyone's 
interested.)

The Propex heater sounds like a very nice unit, and certainly has its 
advantages.  But for those who can't afford $600, don't dispair - a cold 
winter in the bus may yet be averted if you can find a good used gas 
heater.  Before spending a fortune, try the local junkyards; sometimes you 
luck into a nice Vanagon BA6 for $25 or $50 if they don't know what it's 
worth.  And then allow yourself a good weekend's worth of work to put it in 
and get it working right.  But considering the alternatives - $600 poorer 
or cold as heck- a hundred bucks and a weekend's time ain't too bad.
