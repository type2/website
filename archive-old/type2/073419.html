&gt;Hi all, I've got a couple pairs of 34pdsit carbs and was considering trying
&gt;to return my bus to sort of a stock setup.  The manifolds which I have EGR
&gt;valves on the sides, my question is can I get these carbs to run without
&gt;using EGR valves on the rest of the smog system that is supposed to go with
&gt;it.  I'm missing the Mixture distribution assembly, and the EGR tube filter
&gt;which also connects to the manifolds, when I look at the Bus boys catalog it
&gt;shows the mixture distribution assembly with all sorts of things connected to
&gt;it.  Is there anyone out there running these carbs without all this other
&gt;stuff connected? And if so could you share this with me.  If anyone has an
&gt;old 34pdsit setup lying around and would like to unload also let me know,
&gt;everything but carbs themselves.  Thanks in advance.

You can block off the EGR to the manifolds easily.  I used gasket material
and small plates that I cut to fit.

As for the idle distribution pipe, you can probably get away with using
hose and a tee while you search for the correct pipe at a wrecking yard.
Hook the two parallel ends of the tee to the manifolds via hose and run the
remaining end of the tee to the top of the left carb.  Get the strongest
(thickest) hose you can find that is impervious to gasoline and make sure
you route it to avoid sharp bends.  Don't worry about the other connections
to the distribution assembly - they are non-essential.
