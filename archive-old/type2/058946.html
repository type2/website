The original post mentioned that there was no oil pressure at idle.  My
question is what was your rpms at idle?

I noticed that my rebuilt engine will run very smoothly and quietly at about
500 to 600 rpms.  This isn't enough to build up the oil pressure.  Check your
Bently manual for the correct idle rpms for your specific year and options.

If your idle checks out okay, then does this problem occur only when your
engine is warm?  What type of engine oil are you using, and what is your
engine temp when this problem occurs.  It could be that your engine is running
hot causing your oil to thin and the pressure to drop.  You should check out
your fuel delivery system and ignition, and check for vacuum leaks which is a
common cause for hot engines and low rpms.

Just a thought.
