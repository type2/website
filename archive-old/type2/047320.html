Subject: Re: [T2] 1974 VW Safari engine questions

&gt; That is what the local VW dealer told me. I have a 1973 with dual
&gt; Solexes and an automatic tranny.  The dealer told me that the 1700
&gt; and the 1800 were available in 1974.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Where did you hear that?  Every manual I've seen states otherwise.  1974
&gt;&gt; model year U.S. busses came with 1800 engines from the factory.

I have a Volkswagen microfiche showing all the engine types that were
available for each model year the T2 was built. For model year 1974 it
says:

1700cc CD0008723  --&gt; CD 0011000 (produced until dec 1973), buses with
M249/M251/M157
1700cc CB0101139  --&gt; CB 0110000 (produced until dec 1973), buses with
M157/M251

1800cc AP 0000001 --&gt; AP 0027465 (aug '73 --&gt; jul '74), buses with
M251/M249/M251
1800cc AW 0000001 --&gt; AW 0037000 (aug '73 --&gt; jul '74), buses with
M157/M251 or M157/M249/M251
1800cc ED 0000001 --&gt; ED 0000639 (jan '74 --&gt; jul '74), buses with
M157/M249/M251 or M27/M157/M249


M27 = Compliance with exhaust emission standards California
M157 = Exhaust control system and activated carbon container for
absorbing fuel vapour.
M249 = Automatic transmission (1973 -&gt; 1979)
M251 = with type 4 engine (instead of type 1 engine)


Of course the type 1 1600cc engine was also available...and blieve it or
not...in 1974 the T2 was STILL AVAILABLE WITH 1300cc ENGINE!! Never seen
it in real life though, must be pretty rare. There is an M-code for that
engine:

M252 &quot;With 1.3 liter engine (44 BHP) Instead of 1.6 liter engine (50
BHP)&quot;.._dot_can't really call that &quot;an optional extra&quot;.
