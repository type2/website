Subject: Re: [T2] Does the grim reaper drive a bus?


&gt;I drive hyper-defensively and feel safe in the bus. I
&gt;even haul kids in it! I wonder if there's a way to
&gt;find accident stats for bus freaks.

I should think the relatively low insurance rates for the buses says 
something about how safe they are. Or maybe you just can't do much damage in 
a vehicle that slow...
