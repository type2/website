Subject: Re: Camping list, was &quot;Going Cross Country!!!&quot;

Okay, Rick, I gotta admit, that was a great list. But just lemme ask you

PANTY HOSE??? What kinda camping are we talking about here?? I've driven my 
bus all over the country in the last twelve years, without a single pair of 
panty hose.
What am I missing??
