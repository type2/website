&lt;&lt; How about the steering wheel repair kit that is offered by POR 15. They 
show

you how to repair the cracks, plus have special paint for the grip. I have

not seen this done before, but they have a good reputation with their

paints.

Along these lines, anybody know of a site/formula for &quot;bakelite&quot; -
but not black...to repair a steering wheel?
