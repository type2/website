While we are on this topic I would like to ask a little question esp
to Mr Lyle.

Looking at Kennedy Engineerings web page they list the later (EJ 22?)
2.2 litre engines as only being suitable for vanagons due to clearance
problems with the intake system and the fuel tank.  I was looking
under the bonnet of my friends Subaru Liberty (legacy) the other day
and could see that the throttle body extends almost past the edge of
the engine / bell housing mating section.

I then looked in the back of my bus (77 model) and the clearance does
appear extremely tight, however what I was thinking was modifying the
throttle body so it feeds downwards into the plenum of the intake
tract instead of from the back of the plenum.

Does this sound feasible?  the increased height of the throttle body
will not really be a problem inside the bus 

Are there any other reasons apart form this why the 2.2 doesnt fit?

I'm looking for a reasonable power increase as my bus is undergoung
the Bajaification process and I need more HP and torque to turn the
larger tyres I will be running.  And after looking at HP stuff for the
T4 engine the Subaru option starts to look really attractive

Any ideas
