Don't YELL I can see you


but in my 78 I've found.

. darker shinny side goes down
. find middle of the seal and start it in the center rear (pully end, rear
is rear)
. work from the top 
. however I found that the area from the fuel injectors to near the
starter work better from the bottom, so I stuff the whole thing through,
work from the underside, then push it back to the top to finish up along
the firewall
. take your time, use your fingers, I have found surgical gloves seem to
make it easier to handle.
