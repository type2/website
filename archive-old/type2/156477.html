Subject: Re: [T2] Baywindow axles

There's an Autozone one block from my local Advance.   It  almost always either has in stock, or can get the next day, any common  part that I need.  It has saved me a bunch of times when I was in  a hurry.  Advance rarely has what I need.  They just aren't  keeping up with old VW's anymore.  They used to be my first  call.  Not anymore.   Might check the Zone.  And the  quality of parts they sell has improved since they started to serve the  commercial repair business.   Cheers....KR

I work at Advance Auto parts.  We used to be able to get rebuilt CV 
axles for $60 (less actually but round numbers will do).  Last week one 
of my customers called and asked if we had them and I told him of 
course, until I looked in our catalog and it said Nu-uh.  Does anyone 
out there know of another chain that carries the almost universal manual 
transmission axles for about the same price?  I'm gonna stock up.
