With all due respect, I am confident that removing tin will increase my
engine temp. Many credible preople have been saying so since these things
were first built decades ago and I have no reason to doubt the collective
wisdom of all those VW designers, owners, and wise mechanics. In a very
practical sense this conclusion matters most, since it tells me how best to
maintain my precious bus. 

This thread first attracted my attention because it was a discussion of WHY
this might be the case. Does air ramming help cool the bus? If I removed rear
tin (or side tin, or front tin or airflaps, or...), as you suggest, and only
observed engine temperature I would only learn that engine temperature
increases, but I would still be guessing about why it does so. Would I be
sucking in hot air (from the muffler or the engine or the transaxle or...),
or would I be dissipating positive pressure that would otherwise contribute
to cooling?  If I were really interested in the pressure difference at
freeway speed, I would do better to directly measure it than to continue to
make inferences from indirect measures.
