Subject: RE: [T2] Paint question

If it was caused by silicon (ie grease) it would cause fish eyes. This
sounds more like incompatible or poor quality paint.

I have never painted a car with spray cans, but if you paint enamel over
acrylic you can get a problem just like this. If this is the case, you
should not paint with spray cans and start again with real paint.

I would say it is caused by the spray can paint being poor quality (no
offense intended), or by the original paint underneath being incompatible
with it (in which case you could put on another 2 heavy coats of primer (you
need more than 2-3 light coats)).

I hope this helps....

Nicholas

Subject: [T2] Paint question


Hi all,
So I'm having some painting frustrations.  Never done body work before so be
gentle with me.
The top coat is acting funny.  It's sorta making spider web-like patterns in
some areas.  These
webs are slightly raised above the rest of the paint, almost as if the paint
is wrinkling; a funny 
looking bubble. A friend told me it's due to oils from my (or anyone's)
hands under the primer.  
But that doesn't seem correct.
Some background on what I did.  Sanded the rusty spots down to bare metal.
Not all spots were
rusty so I didn't go down to bare metal.  Some spots got POR-15 but most did
not.  Primed, 2-3 
light coats.  Sanded with 400 grit.  Top coated.  First top coat
&quot;spider-webbed&quot; or wrinkled or
whatever.
The real odd thing is this has only happened on the top half of the bus.
The white half.  This isn't
happening on the bottom half.  The only difference is I'm using a white top
color on top and a
yellow on bottom.  Yes, I'm using cheap rattle can Rust-o-leum (no flames,
please) but that 
wouldn't explain why it's only happening in some places.
So I'm a bit frustrated.  Makes me want to grab a paint brush and just start
slapping it on.
All helpful comments appreciated.
Thanks,
-PM
