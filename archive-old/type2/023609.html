OK, sat down and watched &quot;Jaws&quot; again last weekend.
About 55 minutes into the movie when they are showing 
all the tourists coming to Amity Island the day before
the 4th of July, there is a shot of a white over red
split... looks like a deluxe. Didn't want to stop and rewind it, (movie purist... turn the lights off, no
stopping the movie, etc.) Lasts just a second or two.

Anyway, a good excuse to watch a great classic.
