I had the same problem in my 79. What I did was to remove the switches
&amp; clean them. Let them dry. Then pump once or twice to flush out the
small passages in the master cyl that feed the switches. After doing
this &amp; bleeding the system again, I did notice that the lights came on
earlier, but still not as quick as I had hoped.
