&gt; Talk's cheap - there are a great many 10 year old cars on the road here in

&gt; or my 60 bus - Why? Road salt and winter driving! There is a reason why
&gt; there are very few early cars around Southern Ontario - and that reason is
&gt; road salt.

our city determines how bad a winter they had by how many thousands of
tons of salt were spread on the roads...  and I ski so get to some mighty
cold places.

&gt; As I say, talk is cheap - its easy to say to someone buses are meant to be
&gt; driven when it is their bus rusting out and not yours. What kinda person
&gt; would spend thousands restoring an old bus with cheap replacement Brazilian
&gt; panels (becuase they are all you can get). Then drive that bus in the winter
&gt; to replace those same panels again in 4 or 5 years???

been there, doing that...

&gt; windshield so I could see - Know what 30 below is like? But - that was on
&gt; the praries where they rarely use road salt.  I would never do that in
&gt; Ontario - unless I absolutely had to.

well I like to drive my bus and it is a personal opinion, not telling
anyone how to treat their bus,  but I prefer to drive and weld than let it
sit all winter.  some panels are coming up on their 3rd replacement, and
all the frame members have been re-enforced with 1/4 inch angle iron, etc
etc etc... I still like driving it and as long as I can keep it safe and
reasonably dependable I will probably keep driving it.  (besides I can't
afford another car and have no place to keep it if I did)

YMMV
