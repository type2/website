&gt;&lt;&lt; I posted on my 80 Westfalia apparently overheating before and now that I
&gt;have
&gt; an oil temperature gauge, I know it. Down the highway/freeway it indicates
&gt; 220 + in our 100 degree ambient temperatures. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Probably normal, vanagons weighed alot more then kombi's.

Weight has nothing to do with a steady-speed cruise down a level highway.
The van could weigh 100lbs or 10,000 lbs and it would require the same
horsepower to keep it moving.

220 is not very hot - I doubt your engine is overheating.  I regularly run
230 in 100 degree heat, and I still don't consider it to be overheating (I
have a highroof, which actually DOES take more horsepower to move down the
highway because of the increased frontal area).

Of course, I just have the crappy, OEM Porsche VDO gauge mounted in the
sump plate, which some have suggested could be off by 50 degrees (not).
