&gt;Subject: Re: Subject: Source for 2L heads?


&gt;But be aware that even Marc Stephens isn't perfect. David Schwarze and I
&gt;have both gotten unsatisfactory heads from MSHP. Inspect thoroughly!

I too got two bad heads from them.
And, as I do not tire to point out, MSHP will routinely cheat you out of your core
charge.
They do this with such impertinence and efficiency that it is disgusting.
They still owe me $200 and I still get mad just thinking of them.
