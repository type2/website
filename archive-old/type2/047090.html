&gt; hey volks,
&gt; ive got an easy one for you this evening.   i recently
&gt; got ahold of a childs cot out of a 68 westy and
&gt; decided to play with it a little and see how it
&gt; worked.  im not sure if i read it somewhere or heard
&gt; it somewhere but i assumed (i know) that it went
&gt; between the front doors?  well i unrolled it and it is
&gt; too small to fit.  where does this thing go?   ive got
&gt; a 73 riviera but the dimensions of the bus are
&gt; obviously the same.  help a mentally challenge guy
&gt; out:)  
&gt; thanks everyone

Shelby,

I installed an early bay child's cot on our 1972 bus. It was a bit of work
to get it right but It can be done. If you have the right cot the poles will
be of equal length and round. at the end of each pole the is an ear the
hooks into mounts that are screwed into the A and B pilars. One pole goes
between the two sides of the windsheild and the other goes behild the front
seats in the B pilars. If you dont have the mounts go back and get them.
There is only one &quot;sweet spot&quot;  where the poles can mount. If you need
serious installation details let me know.
