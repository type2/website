&gt; I cannot speak to all the canisters and superceeded canister replacements you
&gt; mention.  I'll bet Karl could though!  But 175 201 801A  IS the current VW
&gt; replacement canister for my application (1970 Bus) as well as yours.  It is
&gt; indeed, the ill-fitting plastic cylinder model.  I was very unhappy with it.
&gt; It was what got me started on refilling my old canisters.

Even more confusion: what I pulled off was 171 201 801 A, yet another
number.
