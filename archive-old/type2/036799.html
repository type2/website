&gt;This is not true either.  If the fuel pressure is higher, clearly for any

Sean is correct.  In fact, adjusting fuel pressure is a very easy,
predictable way to change your mixture a couple points at a time.

&gt;&gt; 3) to flow more air, get rid of the air box and strap a k&amp;n air filter to
&gt;&gt; your AFM.

&gt;If you don't mind sandblasting the inside of your engine ;-)
&gt;The reason the K&amp;N flows more air is because it is a much less restrictive
&gt;filter than stock, i.e. more crap winds up inside your engine.

I used to think that too, but now I am a big fan of K&amp;N filters.  I picked
up several horsepower on the dyno (in the Mustang) by swapping in a freshly
oiled K&amp;N panel filter in place of a new Motocraft paper filter (in the
stock airbox).  What's more, I have been running that same K&amp;N filter for
60,000 miles now and have noticed no ill effects.  I clean and re-oil it
every few thousand miles, and the large amount of dirt that is removed each
time is comforting.  Bottom line - if I could find a K&amp;N filter that would
fit my bus, I would be running it.

The auto manufacturers do not equip cars with filters like the K&amp;N from the
factory because they require regular maintennance, and they are
(relatively) expensive.  It is a better mass-market solution to use a cheap
disposable filter that costs a couple of horsepower.  But that doesn't mean
it's right for everyone - certainly not me.

When my bus was at the dyno, I tested it with and without the paper air
filter in place.  There was about a one horsepower difference if I recall.
There is no doubt in my mind that using a K&amp;N filter instead would give me
that one horsepower back.  Percentage wise, that would be about the same
improvement that I saw in the Mustang.  1hp may not seem like a lot, but
every little bit helps, and in a bus I've found that an increase of a few
hp is very noticeable.
