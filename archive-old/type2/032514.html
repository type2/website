Hi folks
Monday, just read the weekend mail and saw a lot about throttle cable/pedal problems so I thought I would tell you about mine and what I did. When I bought the bus, it was not happy with any and I mean ANY kind of hill. The slightest incline meant a trip into 2nd gear. What I found was that each and every link in the throttle system was so worn that cumulatively it meant that when the pedal was moved through it's full range of movement (pedal to the metal) the throttle on the carb was moving only about 25% of its range. I made all new parts for the linkages beneath the cab floor and introduced some phosphor/bronze bushes to the system. Now there is no slack whatsoever and there is now full range of movement at the carb. All this was caused by the PO's inability to put a bit'o' grease on the linkages allowing them to wear to an unrecognisable degree.
I haven't tested it on the road yet as the bus is in a state of severe rebuild but I am confident that the original problem will be cured.
Mike
