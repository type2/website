Subject: Re: [T2] 2003/04 Brazilian VW 1600 Type 2 Danbury campervan

Not sure about the belts, but I've bought parts mailed from Brazil
listed on a popular auction site. In subsequent email, he told me he
would get me anything I wanted from Brazil. He even checked crate
motor price for me. Not sure I could find his email at this point.

&gt; I don't know about anyone else who got this email from Nigel, but I'd sure
&gt; like a set of those retractable seatbelts.  Are they available in the
&gt; States?
