&gt; Easy there, Tiger. This is an international list about busses. Right or
&gt; wrong, there are lots of other forums for you to discuss your political
&gt; opinions.
&gt; Let's try to stay on topic, shall we?

I took what he was saying to be sarcastic.  This remark tipped me off &quot;We
support only countries that place a high priority on human rights, like
Iraq.&quot;  Maybe, I'm wrong!  

I thought it was cool to be considered a cowboy.  If only there was enough
head room in my Westy to wear a Stetson!  We could all remove our front
spare tires and mount some horns there.  That would teach them!

Have a great weekend,
