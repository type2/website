Michael,

You are describing a manual choke.  While they were never stock, I like
them very much.  J.C. Whitney used to offer one.  I'll bet they still do,
but am too tired to look :-)  I wish there was a device that was an
automatic choke, with temporary (run time limited to 5 minutes)  manual
override.  Another idea is an automatic choke that sensed oil temp rather
than having a heater element.

The good news is that manual chokes work well if you do a lot of stop and
start driving in cold weather.  After all, humans are ~75% smarter than
machines in complex situations.

The bad news is that people are only ~75% smarter than machines in complex
situations. If you forget it is on, you can burn up a tank of gas in 50
miles while wondering at the lousy acceleration. (ask me how I know :-)
