I have a 79 with a sun roof you could lower a cow through. It leaks and
I was wondering if any one has experience using weather stripping bought
from a hardware store to replace the old stuff or does one have to go
to a dealer and get the official weather stripping and if so, how much
did that cost?
Thanks - CLW
