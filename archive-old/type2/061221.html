	Pete,
	The friendly VW dealer often has a surprising number of the
little rubber grommets and seals. Drop by when you can spend a few
minutes looking at the fiche with them. It will all be special
order and each seal will cost $1 or more, which is either a lot based
on what they're worth or not much based on what they do :)
	Plus you can make &quot;latex novelty&quot; jokes with the parts
department people from then on :)
	Wolfsburg West and others also have some of the rubber parts. 
But this is one area where the dealer is often your only hope.

	Bill
