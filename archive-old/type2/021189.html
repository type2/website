Well you beat me-my 78 turned 224,000 mi yesterday- but can you claim
never a rebuild, not even the alternator or fuel pump?  Oil pressure
gauge finally installed (thanks Bob &amp; John Perry); 60 cold, 25 hot &amp;
60mph, 10 idle.  Is thqat within limits?  I'll be at Westies in the
Woods  this Fri (NJ) for those who want to drive it and tell me if that 
vibration/rattle that goes away at full load or full throttle is a
bearing death knell or just referred trans noise through the shifter?
