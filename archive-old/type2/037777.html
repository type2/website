Don't remind me!  I'm taking a field trip of 50 physics students there
(Magic Mountain) on Monday.  

Luckily, I talked my wife into chaparoning with me, so once we heard the
kids into the park we can stroll about and pretend we're teenagers
ourselves :)

I have had quite a bit of experience in driving the bus in crosswinds as I
used to work in the Antelope Valley.  I don't mind constant crosswinds all
that much, but the gusts in and out of road cuts keep me on my toes.

Of course, I used to ride a motorcycle in the same conditions, so the bus
doesn't seem all that bad by comparison.
