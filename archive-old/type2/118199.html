Subject: Re: [T2] looking for T2-microfiches

I have been slack about reading list mail lately but I saw your name 
and am really glad to see that you are still around! The work you 
have done in the area of production detail has been of great interest 
to me! Thanks!

I have to agree with you about the CDs. The line drawings are helpful 
but the NLA in lieu of data is frustrating. Several years ago, the VW 
dealership parts manager loaned me his person copy (which I promptly 
disassembled and copied) of the T2 dealer parts books for the model 
years 1968 thru 1972. I have found it a great resource and would not 
own a bus without a copy.

A friend of mine purchased at a swap meet a four volume (A4 paper in 
four ring euro-binder) VW shop publication dealing with body work and 
repairs for T1 and T2 Transporters. I has descriptions, line drawing 
and photos. I need to make some high quality copies.

Keep up the good work!

&gt;Yes I know the ETKA. I also have it but so many parts
&gt;are mentioned as 'Nicht mehr lieverbar' / 'No longer
&gt;available'...after I click on them. Actually I am not
&gt;interested to see if they are still available. I want
&gt;to know the extra info that comes with certain parts:
