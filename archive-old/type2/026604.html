Last night, while trying out a new parking plan in my yard, I almost hit my
wives car.  In my valiant effort to avoid the collision, I was turning the
steering wheel very fast.  Well, my had missed the spoke in the steering
wheel but did not miss the turn signal switch lever.  Yep, I broke that
little lever right out of the housing.  The plastic piece that it goes into
is broken, so there is no fixing it.  If anyone has a good condition,
properly working turn signal switch, please sell it to me.  Just let me know
how much you want for it.

I think that the '72 is a one year only switch, but I am not sure.  I do
know that the lever is metal, painted black, with a black 'plastic' tip on
the end.  Please help me find one of these.  I have 2 parts busses, but both
the turn signal switches were already broken.

By the way, I did not hit the car!!!

Thanks,
