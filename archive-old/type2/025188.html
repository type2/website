Subject: sparkplug sizes and compression tests
Date: Mon, 7 May 2001 11:08:07 -0600 
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

this past weekend i decided to do a compression test on my 71 westy.  i
started the test and my first cylinder came out to 65.  not so great.  i
gave it a little oil, and it went up to 69.  the second and third were both
a 90. didn't get to do # 4 because of time, i am going to do it this
afternoon after work. the weird thing was that the sparkplugs changed to  a
different size on 3 and 4.  i couldn't really figure it out.  i sat there
for awhile trying to figure out what was going on.  the 2 spark plugs that
came from 3 and 4 are both really black. 

my first question: does it matter that the sparkplugs are two different
sizes?

from what i have read, since the oil didn't help the compression on #1, it
isn't the rings. second question:should i start look at a rebuild? 

TIA,

Rawls Moore
