Subject: riviera poptop

Hey everybody,

I'm considering making my '73 sunroof bus into a camper.  I can get a
Riviera poptop and canvas for $25 - $50.  I want to make sure that I'll be
able to reasonably attach this poptop before I make the hour-long drive to
see/buy it.

Does anyone have any closeup pictures of a riviera poptop.  I'm especially
interested in how it attaches to the roof of the bus.

Thanks,
Brian
