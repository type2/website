Subject: BusFusion Camping was great! with picture links

I was at a camp out this weekend close to the Capitol City of Canada 
Almonte was bustling with Arts and Bus folks ,I have heard over 100 campers!
The main page is http://members.aol_dot_com/BusFusion/bfhome.htm

Dave Homer, London, Ontario took some photos, and posted them 

Wow! Dave did a great Job on the photo's.. I sure hope I can meet up with him
some day!
Maybe Niagara Falls in 2 weeks http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/BBTF2001.htm

You'll see the VW cookies to the Art painted Buses.. to the serenity of the
Carolinian trees and the beach!
Dave's pictures tell a nifty story,,

He didn't provide captions,, so I added some narration here

I didn't even get a chance to meet him!
But here are some links to my favorite's of his pictures 

As you will see there is Buses from early flip seat sub hatch westy to a Rialta

This is as close as I got to the Early Westy,, I only seen it in pictures! .
It was in the Bus painting contest,

There was a Riviera Camper ,strange bumper though ;-)

There was a 68 Devon Camper that has traveled alot of the world, and still is
originally owned!

Arabia, Britain, etc.
