Better not try to drive the bushing out of a kyb shock for a BUS!  You'll
never get it back in!.  I use a vice grip on the old bushing, a little heat,
maybe some WD40  twist and  smack it with a big  F**D wrench should come
off.  Oh, did you say bug?  Never mind....

&gt; I have two KYB GR2 gas shocks to put on my 70 bug, but when I took the old
&gt; ones off, the bottom steel spacer/bushing stayed on the bottom torsion arm
&gt; on the shock mounting! I thought &quot;no problemo, I'll just drive the
&gt; spacer/bushing out of the new KYB shock and put it on with the old bushing
&gt; still stuck there, but no way can I drive it out! Suggestions? I don't
have
&gt; access to heat to try to free up the old bushing, but I have a
&gt; dremel/grinder, can I carefully cut this old bushing away? Is there
&gt; something I'm missing re: driving out the new bushing on the KYB shock? It
&gt; is NOT moving either!
&gt; HELP!
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Courtney
