Subject: WTB-  in-dash fans for 68-78 bus 

Anyone out there have a lead on those nifty fans that go in the fresh-air
ducts, just below the dash?
I know at least one Listte has them (got 'em from Mexico I believe)...
local junkyard is out.
Pmail me if you know the whereabouts and costage of said bugger.
TIA
