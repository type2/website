Subject: Re: Please help me

&gt;the little nub on the front of the front axle beam has developed a tear in
&gt;the metal about 2 inches long making it difficult to steer and impossible to
&gt;convince my wife that there is any value in spending any more money on my
&gt;beloved 71 bus.  Any thoughts on replacement/repair?  ...


Chris,


Not knowing the extent of your &quot;tear&quot; or where you are located, I do
know that there is a '71 bus sitting in the Wilmington CA Ecology
wrecking yard just waiting for you. The front beam is complete and can
be remove fairly easily. I was looking at it real closely last weekend
and decided to wait a bit before tearing one out for my '60.  They
quoted me $88 for the entire assembly (with the disc brakes), AND this
saturday they are having a 50% off sale.
