&gt; Looking at purchasing another bay, and have found an add

&gt; Anyway, before I go traveling across the town to look at it
&gt; I was wondering if someone could tell me what kind of motor
&gt; was in these models, I'm presuming it's a Type IV motor, but
&gt; have no idea of capacity, or whether it's EFI or Carb....?

If it were a US model, with the original equipment, it would have a 1.8l
fuel injected type4.  Of course, it would also be left hand drive and
called a &quot;Transporter&quot; or &quot;Station Wagon&quot;....

I dont know what the NZ/AU models might have been....maybe you should let
us know when you find out. ~grin~  (..or ask the owner.  it's very
possible that whatever it came with originally is no longer there...)
