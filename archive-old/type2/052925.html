Thanks to all of you that replied and tried to help me these last few days. 
I went out with a clear head last night and had another look after work, and 
I found that the hose that goes into the crank case right below the right 
carb was off. It took me a while to find it but when I did I put it back on 
and it started and idled fine. I guess I will be putting a clamp on that 
hose now and I will learn to relax a little more. As for the valves I don't 
think I will be having any problems as long as I make sure everything is 
nice and tight.

Thanks,
