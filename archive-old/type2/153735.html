Subject: Re: [T2] tire pressure

Kevin said:


Hey guys.  I looked in the archives and didn't find the  answer.  I got my Hancooks today.  17 days after I
ordered  them!  The plate on the steering wheel says 185 SR 14  Reinforced.  Front pressure....30 PSI,
Rear...40 PSI.  But  the tires say 65 PSI.  I've never had a 65 PSI tire before!   So what is correct?

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

65 is the max pressure you can put in that tire, NOT what you should run it at.

Larry Chase on the Vanagon list made a good website on tires:
http://www.roadhaus_dot_com/tires/guideline.html

In it, he says the 30 and 40 specs were for the reinforced sidewall tires. I agree with that :)

He shows tires that were OEM on Vanagons and Syncros:

185R14C  6PR
- Min Load Index 99
- Max Load 1710 lbs
- Min Load Range C
- Max Inflation 55 psi

and

205R14C 6PR/8PR
- Min Load Index 109
- Max Load 2270 lbs
 - Min Load Range D
- Max Inflation 65psi

For these, he recommends 50 psi minimum. [all the way at the bottom]
