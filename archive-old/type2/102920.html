&gt; Can we simply run a tap through these threads to clean them out, or do
&gt; we need to drill and re-tap one size larger?

Rust can make threads look really bad before it is cleaned away.  Oxidized
metal takes up a lot more room than the original metal did, so the threads
may well be OK.

Go ahead and run a tap through carefully.  Lube it often and go in small
steps in and out.  Remember the idea is to clean out the existing threads,
not to cut new metal.

Put on the new backing plates and torque the bolts to the correct spec.
If the threads hold the specified torque, they should be fine.  Otherwise,
you will have to take corrective measures.
