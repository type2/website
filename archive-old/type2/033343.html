Subject: Weber 32/36 DFAV Jets &amp; More

Searched the archives and could make little sense of the conflicting info
on the subject. For some reason, I think the list may have matured on this
topic since some earlier debates, so I'll toss it out again. 

I have a 32/36 DFAV Weber progressive that I picked up used from another
list member. I want to rebuild this for a spare fuel delivery system, but I
have read (in the archives) of jetting and icing problems. Obviously, I
want a nice, balanced power curve and no ice. Logic tells me that if I
supply warmed engine air via heat exchanger ducting, I can probably
eliminate or reduce the carb icing problem. I can imagine a low-complexity
ducting system that will address that problem, but I'd love to hear what's
worked for you.

Jetting is another issue. I'll be honest--I'm not certain I even know what
a carb jet is. I only know that lots of people have said you need the right
ones. I'm thinking these are the passages that supply fuel to various parts
of the carb and on the webers, they are replaceable for various applications.

It appears that 009 distributors have caused problems for some users. I
have a stock vacuum advance dizzy on my '77 2.0 liter, but no vacuum port
on the 32/36. I see where there are locations *for* vacuum ports on the
carb. Can I drill one with any chance of success or am I into engineering
beyond mortal skills? (I ain't no engineer!)

My particular application is an 1800 engine...or a 2.0 liter engine with
1800 heads. I have the 2.0 liter now and will have the other in a few
weeks. I want to put this carb on one or the other. So where do I go from
here?

I figure to start with I'll get the best Weber book I can: which would you
recommend? Haynes or Pat Braden's &quot;Weber Carburetors&quot;?

As to jetting and pre-heating, I would love to learn from your experiences.
I will be happy to volunteer to compile a collection of p-mails and/or
postings into a tech article for the Type2 site. It appears that these sort
of questions come up often enough that it would be a good addition.

For the FI afficianados, I have learned a great deal about FI and I like
it. I'll probably keep that on the bus for now, but I want to expand my
knowledge base to learn about carbs as well. Nothing wrong with knowledge,
except in the small amounts you have at the beginning.

Thanks! Joe
