&lt;&lt; Now don't get me wrong... buses have a hell of a lot more going for
them than that -- there's the relationship to the Beetle; the
beauty/simplicity/genius of the whole air-cooled thing; the functional-
yet-stylish-in-a-quirky-way design; etc., etc....
 &gt;&gt;

How many VW vans would still be on the road today if they needed
an engine hoist? Same with many new cars...Priced a clutch replace-
ment on some cheap-to-begin-with FWD cars...Being a selective lud-
dite, I appreciate the &quot;modern&quot; features of the Type 2 as well as its
&quot;vintage&quot; owner-servicability...:-)
