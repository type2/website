Subject: '68 Konbi hesitation

I have a ^Ò68 Type 2 Kombi.  Basically it has a stock 1600 single port, 
stock carb, 009 distributor.  The engine was rebuilt 1 year ago and has 
about 9K miles.  
For the last 3 or 4 moths it has been hesitating when going from a dead 
start in first gear, and sometimes does it when beginning other gears.  
It bucks 2 or 3 times, then sometimes backfires, then goes OK.
I have changed plugs, plug wires, points, fuel filter, distributor rotor 
and cap, none of these helped.
After reading many messages at from this list, I am under the impression 
that it may have to do with not having a vacuum advance distributor.  
Also the other day there was a message linked to Boston Engines, which 
after reading it I was under the impression that maybe I should try 10 
BDTC.   So I tried it, and it runs much better, but when I reach 45-50 
MPH on the highway it seems like the engine is being overworked.  It 
sounds much louder from the cabin.  When at TDC(which is what the place 
that put it together set it at) it runs smoother and quieter at 
45-50MPH.
I have also tried readjusting the carb, with no success.

ANY help or ideas will be greatly appreciated.

Also should you think that the distributor is the prob., do you have any 
idea where I can get a vacuum advance distributor?(and the approx. 
price?)

Thank You Again,

Joe
