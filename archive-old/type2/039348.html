Subject: Door window trim removal

OK, got the doors off and now I would like to know from you experts if there 
are any tricks on removing the door window seals - felt channels, etc. I 
checked the library and can't get into the archives. Bently's is helpful, but 
not as much as I would like, so any help would be appreciated. (BTW my 
bently's has some color wiring diagrams. I heard some questions from the 
group about them)

My fiancee saw her first splitwindow SC, and now SHE wants one. The 
programming is going along nicely ***diabolical laughter*** We will soon have 
another in our ranks....

TIA
