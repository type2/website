Subject: Speedo with trip and Big valve heads for sale (INFO)
X-Diagnostic: MESSAGE MAY NOT BE TOPICAL

Over the last 24 Hours I have be hit with a large number of e-mails about these
two items. I would have pictures, but the darn things got lost in cyberspace
between my work computer and home. I will be back to work in a few days, but no
picture till then, I ma sorry. The Speedo with tripometer is in perfect working
order and looks great, comes complete with the rest of the instrument cluster
and housing. I have had over 12 ask for this and I was taking offers. I have
decided to just ask for the first person to give me $100 for it will get it. I
hate Ebay and do not want to run my own auction, so this is the fairest way I
know how to do it. 
The type 4 1.8Lheads also drew a lot of mail. These are good condition used
heads. 41mm Intakes, the largest stock valves used by VW on type 4 heads. These
are only stock on 74 1.8L heads and Porsche 2.0L heads, thee alow you to get
big valves and use Bus engine tin. These have no cracks and have not droped
seats or anything, however they do need rebuilding due to normal wear. I would
like $150 for them. First one to respond gets them. 
I am posting this to the lists due to the overwhelming interest I have had in
them. This way all get the message at the same time. 
If you want, you can call me after 2pm (west coast)at (360)400-0935.
I will let the list know when they are sold.

Scott Solomon
Working to get my new Westy.
