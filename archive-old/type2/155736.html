Subject: Re: [T2] FW: Spill-proof cans -- suck!

&gt; CARB has finally returned my calls. I will be turning this CARB
&gt; mandated design into a consumer safety issue which I believe is
&gt; punishable by death here in CA.
&gt;

Can you work on them for the stupid vapor recovery nozzles at the gas
station too? I've probably dumped 5 gallons of gas on the ground since I got
to CA 2 weeks ago.

The 73 with its recessed filler was much less of an issue than my 78. The
paint around the filler is starting to peel from the gas. :(
