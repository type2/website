Subject: Re: [T2] steering coupler folks be aware!!!!

Just wanted to let y'all know that Mercedes uses the same coupler as VW on 
several of its  1970-1990 models, but it is built much stouter than the 
aftermarket VW couplers, and this should come as no surprise, about twice the 
price. Just thought I'd pass it along.
