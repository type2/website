Subject: transmision compatability

Well Ezmereldas Tranny continues to pop out of first,
but as I dont drive around in 1st overmuch, its not a
big deal..yet. However getting another tranny is on my
mind and I seem to recall compatabilty issues. She is
a 75 with the origanal motor in her. what year trannys
will fir her. To complicate matters I have just
purchased a 72 LB for a spare motor (thanks Brandy),
so Id like a tranny that will fit both. What are the
issues here?

Duncan
