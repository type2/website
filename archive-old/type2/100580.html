Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

  The problem I have found with putting plywood on the roof rack is it
really affects the handling of the bus at 70 plus MPH, also I noticed that
in cross winds it is like a sail moving me all around. I did this when I
drove to NM and have since removed the plywood. Going to Jerome with it
loaded and slower made no difference in the way it handled.

  Did make a great photo platform though!

The full length rack is a great thing to have, even if you don't put cargo
up there/  Get a sheet of 1/4 inch CDX plywood, prime and paint it white,
and attach it to the rack with electrical conduit clamps.  You will get a
reduction in interior temperatures of 10 degrees or more with the top of
the bus shaded.
