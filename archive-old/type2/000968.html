someone said recently here that if i am backfiring when i decelerate it
means i have a lean mix? i am in CA and have all this cool smog crap on my
bus which i disconnected. (either way it b/f's)i do not have big backfires,
just these small mini ones when i decel. does that still mean i have a lean
mix? and how the heck to i mix it right? i've never had my carbs redone
since i have dual carbs and it'll cost too much to fix. after november i am
planning to rip out my dual carbs an switch to single carb so i dont want to
redo my duals now. anything i can do in the meantime that doesnt cost 50
million dollars? thanks :)

regards, dave :)
