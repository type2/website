All:  If you were to get an oil temp gage, which would you get?  Do they
make one which will screw in to the pressure sender as well?

Don't know how to order, but I received an address (since lost) in which the
advertizer had for sale heater to body tubes for my '72.  Sure would like to
find out how to order those things.

Regards,
