I too have been considering installing an O2 or CO sensor to calibrate my new FI
engine.  Can anyone recommend a place to weld the threaded insert on a stock
1600 exhaust setup with heat exchangers?  I've considered mounting it between
the heat exchanger and muffler on one side or the other.  I realize this only
measures one side, but that's better than none, correct?

Thanks for the input.
