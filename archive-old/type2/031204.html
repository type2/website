&gt; I have had starter problems for the past 12 years on my '77 Westfalia.
&gt; Typically with a hot engine: no start, just the hum.  I developed a work

&gt; switch that crosses the starter terminals...I mounted this in the engine
&gt; compartment.  

yes, I have done this for years
&gt; 
&gt; Today, however, I installed a genuine Robert Bosch relay kit (about $8) made
&gt; just for hot start problems in older VWs.  It mounts near the starter and is
&gt; very easy to install, about 30 minutes.  Good instructions, pictures; goof

yes, I keep procrastinating.

&gt; I haven't used mine enough to know yet whether it will always work, so I

don't take out the old switch, it works great for bumping the engine while
working on it, or just crank the engine while working on it.
