Subject: Re: [T2] cheap busses and brakes

That would never work for me. I try always to pay what something's
worth, not what I can get it for. (That's not &quot;market economy,&quot; it's
&quot;moral economy:&quot; see E.P Thompson's &quot;The Making of the English Working
Class.&quot;) Just as I would never charge anyone to help fix their bus, or
accept payment, so too do I think that taking advantage of another
person's hardship is not the bus way. But that's me. I suppose it's
kind of un-American. On the other hand, a VW is not American either.

A debate on this point is not appropriate for this list, so I don't
want to touch one off. I know from experience that there are some on
the list who agree with me, and some who think I'm daft. To each his
own.
