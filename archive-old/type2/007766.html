this message is going out to my corvair friends and bus friends, I have a
71 bus with a transvair kit in it
(110 hp corvair engine) and I am freezing in it at night. I work nights and
get off at 11:00 and have to go iinto the mountains on my drive home. I
have been doing alot of research on the heating problems for buses and all
air cooled vehicles and even with the best stock heater boxes etc. these
systems seem inadequate.
 From what every one seems to say especially in the bus world is that gas
heaters are the way to go. So the other day I called a company which sells
Espar heaters and found the unit that would fit my bus and they wanted
1,200.oo bucks for a new one.....I'm cold but not crazy,  so since I have
spent alot of time researching the type2 archives I found some info on
early corvair Stewart Warner gas heaters which came standard on some early
Corvairs.
 Today I have found 2 for 50 .oo bucks and my question is this ....has
anyone installed one in a bus.
can you still get parts for them and are they safe and reliable. also are
they better than the Espar heater. Basically I would have a ton of
questions about them.
  Also what is cool is the fact that I own an early corvair shop maual
which has about an inch thick chapter on the gas heater and has expoded
views , how to service them etc. the only problem is that corvair put them
in the trunk, up front and the bus installation would obviously be totally
different.

If anyone knows anything about thisset up on a bus, PLEASE give me a
holler, thanks....Keith
