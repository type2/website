Subject: Re: [T2] fan shroud flaps

&gt; While replacing my heat exchangers yesterday I noticed that the flaps on the
 fan shroud are missing on mine. I know I've read about these flaps but can't
 remember exactly what they are for. Something about the airflow while the
 booster fan is off or something like that right? My question is, are these
 flaps a critical part of the cooling for my motor? Should I pull my exhaust
 again and replace them? I really dont want to if I dont have to. It was a real
 PITA to get everything lined back up and bolted.

Unless you have a gas heater, i.e. BA 6, you do not need them. 
They stop heated air flow from escaping thru the fan housing when the gas heater is on.
During normal running, the air blows out the bottom and into the heater boxes.
