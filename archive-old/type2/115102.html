&gt; What hooks up to the coil and on what side?      I have run a new wire front
&gt; to back.  The wire that was fried was in #12 on the fuse box.  I replaced
&gt; that wire.  could I have the wire to the coil messed up with the oil idiot
&gt; light?

Terminal 1
 - green wire for condenser
 - white wire for the FI harness

Terminal 15
 - black wire for booster fan.
 - black ignition wire (goes to fuse holder and double relay from same side
of the fuse holder, the other end of of the fuse goes to the backup light
switch)

&gt; Mystery wires one on them have a brown vw union/splice connector on it.  I
&gt; assumed that one goes to the oil sender.. I am second guessing everything
&gt; now!  damn!

Oil pressure sender is a blue wire. The only solid brown wire in my engine
compartment is at the double relay and it comes out of the bundle of wires,
and grounds to the screw holding in the series resistors. All the rest are
grounds for the rearward lighting.
 
&gt; What is required to make in start?

I had the same problem when I put my engine back in. I turned the key and
nothing happened. It turned out to be a black wire on the left side that I
had not plugged in.

I'm sure you're close to making it happen.
