hey guys/gals...I'm going to be putting an engine together for the heck
of it soon..and noticed someone on the list said they had &quot;semi hemi cut
heads&quot; and can run anything without overheating...well...
I just want someone to explain to me what this is and what the pros/cons
of this are....and how expensive it usually is...or if I can do it
myself (have acess to a nice milling machine)

thanks!
