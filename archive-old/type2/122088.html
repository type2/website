Subject: charcoal canister hose

I don't have the hose running from the charcoal canister to the nipple by #2 
cyl. - I just noticed today. Very interesting that there's a post about that 
exact thing. What is NOT happening because that's missing?

By the way - very happy today. I'm recovering from a bad ankle injury, and 
for the first time in 10 weeks I could drive my bus! I had to pick it up 
from the mechanic, who patched my fuel tank. It started but wouldn't idle. I 
made it home, badly and bummed.  After 30 mins scratching my head I found 
one of the hoses on/near the intake manifold was off - I think it may have 
been the aux air regulator. Presto! Back on top! Drove around for an hour 
this afternoon!
