&gt; My engine is rebuilt. It has an alternator, not a generator. The red
&gt; light stays on at idle (the engine is generally idling a little slow, but
&gt; better than it was), and then appears to go off during normal driving.
&gt; However, when driving in the dark, I've noticed that the light actually
&gt; doesn't go off completely--it sort of glows softly. It just isn't bright
&gt; enough to notice during the day.

I had a bug that did this, drove me NUTS, I tried all kinds of things to
straighten it out... turned out to be a dirty connector off the battery.
I think Muir suggested painting over the light with nail polish if it
bugged you!
