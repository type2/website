Subject: New Engine won't start!

Okay List,
I have a 73' bus with a rebuilt 2.0 (purchased longblock), new 009 
distributor, replaced the dual carbs with the Weber Progressive kit...
I know some of you are squeezing your eyes and saying, &quot;Your problem is the 
Weber&quot;, but wait just listen.

I want to stay positive about the Weber since the engine hasn't even started 
yet!

Problem: No Start

Scenerio: Engine installed everythings connected (double checked).  Engine 
Cranks, but no start.
I installed the 009 Bosch Dist. after finding TDC on the Number 1 cyl, with 
the fan pulling marking '0' degrees on the scale.  I noticed that the drive 
slot did not look like it was in the correct position.
Meaning: The book shows for dual carb/fuel injected engines that the drive 
slot should be at around 12 degrees.  Visually in the book the top of the 
slot starts at say the 11 0'clock position down to the 5 O'clock position 
(looking straingt down at it).  However, when I find TDC, Both valves closed 
and the fan pulley is at '0'on the scale the drive slot on my van is more 
like; starts at 1 o'clock down to the seven o'clock position.  I decided 
since the fan pulley only goes on one way ('0' mark correct on scale) and 
the valves were closed and I can visually see the piston at the top (sligtly 
on the downstroke when pulley is at zero)that maybe the drive was set 180 
out or something.

The Dist. only goes in one way so with that in mind, piston at TDC, valves 
closed, pulley marking zero.  I dropped the distributor in.  The rotor faces 
a 9 O'clock pos. (right on the dist. marking) if you are looking straight 
down at the distributor.  I placed my number one plug where the rotor was 
facing.  I then started my 1432 firing order from there (clockwise)
I've got fuel to the carb (no leaks)
I've got spark from the coil
I've got spark at the plugs
But, still no start.
I put the timing light on it while my friend cranked it over for me and the 
pulley is straight on zero.  I advanced it slowly to 8, 10 advanced and it 
seemed like it wanted to get a puff, but Still no start.
I'm now on a beer brake! Calming down...

Question: Am I missing something obvious here?  I know sometimes when I get 
in a rush, or just damn tired, I skip a few steps or just can't
think anymore.

Requesting a meeting of the minds session...So, if anyone wishes to comment, 
help, offer advice.  All would be appreciated.  Please, positive attitudes 
only.
Lo
