It'd be great if you could &quot;walk me through&quot; all the modifications
I'll need to make.  What about the oil breather? It's definately different.
You can reply to me &quot;off-list&quot; if it is easier at
Matthew_S_Cuddy_at_aoncons_dot_com  or mattcuddy_at_hotmail_dot_com

Thanks to everyone who threw in their 2 cents.

&gt;The 80 long block should work fine (condition warranted).  Just strip
&gt;the tin, etc off the 79 block and put it on the 80.
&gt;
&gt;The only change will be the 12 mm bolts on the engine carrier, and
&gt;which ever way you want to go on the dip stick.
&gt;
&gt;I can walk you through it if you want.
