Subject: On the road again

Well, the old '75 orange Westy is back on the road again....after a
transaxle swap....2 stitches to left middle finger....and a brand new
clutch disk....

Now I gotta hook up the heater cables so that when the temps drop
tomorrow night we can have some heat in &quot;Baby&quot;

Anybody out there interested in a rebuildable 1200 bug engine?  Leave
E-mail.
