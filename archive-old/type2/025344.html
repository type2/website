The bus is located in Hazlehurst, GA which is in the southern part of the
state. 3.5 hrs from atlanta toward savannah sort of.

Particulars:
Engine:  1600 DP  Good

Rebuilt completely 6 months ago by a local VW shop in Vidalia, Georgia. The
engines cranks good and runs good and strong! Cruises well at 60-65 mph.

It does need a new generator, and the light does come on to accentuate that
fact.

Tranny:  Good

Shifts very nice and does not pop out of gear.  Shifts good and easy with no
play, no more than expected of a good shifting bus anyway.  the clutch is
strong and in adjustment.

Brakes: fair

It stops but more than likely could use a good bleeding.  (I wouldn't use
the leeches, just the bleeding will do.  Thats what did old papa George in.
: )

Body:  Good

Color: Red

The PO had killed the rust and tried his hand at bondo for all the rot
spots.  The rockers had some rust but instead of replacing the panel he
doped bondo in it and sanded on it.  I would replace the panels eventually
but it's good for now.

Its actually all very straight.  if you are not a total resto freak you
could get by with an earl schieb paint job and this bus would look pretty
good.  For that matter 2 cases of wally world spray paint would do in a
pinch and for the time being.

The front clip is straight but it does have some rust around the windshield.
The glass is not broken and someone has filled the leaky places with
silicone.  it looks like they used enough to last at least a coupla years.
If it leaks I would be surprised.

Pop-Top:  Good

Canvas is in great condition.  it does have a small tear toward the hinge
but it shouldn't be a problem to iron on a patch.  It's about the size of a
half dollar.

The mosquito netting is good, but has one or two small tears. It does have
the three side neeting on the top canvas.

The canvas doesn't appear to be to old.  it's olor is nice and the fabric is
stiff.  

Interior:  Good

Z bed and jumpseat are there, but no sink.  The covering is good and appear
to be the stock &quot;baby dookie yellow&quot;.  It needs new carpeting and the front
seats need covering.  All is OK after that.  the cabinets are there and are
in good shape. 

Pan:  Good

Solid as a rock and doesn't appear to have any damage or rust.  I looked at
it fairly well and it's cool.

Driving:  Good

the bus drives great. The tires are good, look to be fairly new, and the
shocks appear to be pretty young as well.

The front end is tight and so is steering.  if I didn't need the money for
my business I would keep the dang thing.

I am asking $1500 for the bus.

Only serious inquiries please.  Please reply to me privately and keep it off
list. 

This is a drive-away bus!

Thanks,

Charlie Ford
