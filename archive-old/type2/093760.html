Subject: dwell went south

After my weekend valve adjustment and tune-up my points went south this morning.  The bus started to chug alot and a quick check with the dwell meter gave an erratically low reading between 11-21 degrees.

I took the points out and notice a big pit so I filed them flat and put them back in. Now the dwell is back to normal.  Why did this happen?  The adjustment screw wasn't loose.

Something else I'll pass along: on the first try dwell was set to 54 so I thought I'd take it for a drive and see what the results were.  Well, no low end acceleration power but once the RPMs increased sufficiently accelerating within the crusing range was no problem. I believe the list advice that 49-51 degrees is optimal.  The night before when it was 50 was great.

Question: if I file the points flat is this the same as new points (any value over 50 degrees per Bentley is out of spec).
