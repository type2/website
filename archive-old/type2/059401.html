Subject: Re: 34 PDSIT carb - idle mixture enrichment
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Jim,
Thanks for the information.  I tested the resistor and it is stuffed.  No
circuit.  this means it won't heat the strip so it will allow the idle to be
too rich after warmup.  Its summer here now so I would prefer to cope with
rough idle at start and normal mixture when warm.  So I rigged the little
valve - it is a little round brass plug that fits into hole - so that it is
always closed.  What I'm not sure of is whether the resistor and bimetallic
strip causes the plug to close the hole when warm or open it when warm.  I
have gambled on it closing when warm, but a bimetallic strip can operate
either way depending on design.  To decide whether I have gambled correctly,
I need to know how it works.  I assume that air flows through the enrichment
valve, not fuel and not mixture.  If so, why would the valve close when
warm, cutting off the extra air which would otherwise make the idle mixture
leaner when warm?  On this view of things it would make more sense to open
when warm allowing the air through?
If disconnected, wouldn't the engine idle fine when cold but not when warm?

&gt;Because the 34PDSIT's are chambered and jetted for rather lean running, the
&gt;purpose of the enrichment valve (also called enrichment valve resistor) is
&gt;to allow a healthy dose of fuel into the idle circuit during warm-up.  As
&gt;the resistor inside this heats up, the valve eventually closes, just like a
&gt;choke operates, allowing the choke butterfly to open up.  The engine will
&gt;run with it disconnected, but idle at stone-cold start can be rather
&gt;erractic for the first 5 minutes or so because of the lack of fuel
&gt;enrichment.

If disconnected, wouldn't the engine idle fine when cold but not when warm?

&gt;It is correct to connect the resistor in-line with the
&gt;choke/cut-off valve wire(s).
&gt;
&gt;VW no longer makes these units, but I have a couple of NOS carb tops with
&gt;these attached if anyone's in need of replacing theirs - see my &quot;Oddball
&gt;Page&quot; on the website.
