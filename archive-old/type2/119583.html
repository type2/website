&lt;&lt; Moral of the story, busses are overpriced! I finally found one here on the 
E.

Coast that I liked. Cost me $1800 and needs so much work it makes me sad. :-(


I mean, if you see a bus for $10,000, that better be one damn nice bus! ;-)


My $0.02 cents,

What's your labor worth? Even at minimum wage, I'd bet you could get
thousands tied up into an even free bus...Hate to say it, but it's sup-
ply and demand...They ain't makin any more of 'em so if you want one,
you've got to deal with them that's got 'em...
