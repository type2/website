Subject: Siliconing Side Opening Windows??

The silicone on my side opening flap windows (the long narrow ones) that was
put there by the PO is starting to come off.

Does anyone have any suggestions for when I redo this?

Thanks in advance,

PS It's better if you email direct (awebb_at_sfu_dot_ca), cause I'm digesting:-)
