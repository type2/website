Subject: 250 degrees to high?

Yea, I think that is too high! 250 is way out of bounds as far as I'm 
concerned. My old (now sold) 69 ran that high once. Scared the crap out 
of me, I was a long way from home.
But my current bus, a 63, with a stock 1600 single port with a doghouse 
cooler only never gets hotter then 220. In fact, in 90 degree  weather 
at 65 mph it stays about 210. Hills will push it higher to 220, but then 
it drops off. Normally, in 80 or so weather it sits just about 190. 
Different oils can handle extremes, but what is your engine saying to 
you if it is running hot? Maybe you need to look at the overall picture. 
I have seen 1776 and near 2000 cc engines with a doghouse keep thier 
cool as well.
Jason
