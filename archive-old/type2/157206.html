Subject: Re: [T2] First time points adjustment...

&gt; It makes pretty fireworks with Pertronix too. Which
&gt; is why I'm running
&gt; points at the moment... ::blush:

Gee, Don, you too? I was leaving on a trip and just
buttoning everything back up after having the engine
out. It was about 10PM and dark, but I knew my way
around in the engine compartment well enough - just
couldn't see the colors! Needless to say, it was one
more delay in hitting the road! -BaH
