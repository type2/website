Subject: RE: Mexican 1600dp longblock group purchase

Hi Fred,
[...]
This is an area that I had noticed some differences too.  Wild
speculation on my part:  Do they _really make_ a case in Mexico?  I
almost wonder if all cases are made in Brazil and Mexico (VW) imports
them...

Has anyone ever had/seen a Mexican 1600 Magnesium case?

BTW, my visit to the show is what prompted me... I figured a group
purchase might get the price down to $1K (no core).  I'm very curious
what these local dealers are paying..

Another issues.. besides the cast vs. forged crank... is &quot;VW factory&quot;
offering the warrenty?  What are the local FLAPS offering on these?

&gt; 
&gt; At the Puyallup show vendors had both Mexican and Brazilian new Type 1
&gt; 1600 DP 
&gt; longblock engines.  Same specs, etc., but built in different
&gt; countries, and 
&gt; same price of around $1200.00.
&gt; 
&gt; EXCEPT, the Brazilian longblocks allegedly have a different, and
&gt; better, alloy 
&gt; in their crankcase castings.
&gt; 
&gt; The one vendor I talked to that had the Brazilian engines said they'd
&gt; changed 
&gt; to them from the Mexican engines because of the improved case alloy,
&gt; and that 
&gt; they were quite pleased with the change.  They've done some custom 
&gt; modification on these engines and have found that the Brazilian cases
&gt; machine 
&gt; much more cleanly than the Mexican cases and that the difference was
&gt; obvious 
&gt; when you get inside the cases.
&gt; 
&gt; This is obviously heresay information.  Can anyone confirm these
&gt; allegations, 
&gt; and provide details on the different case alloys?  Inquiring minds
&gt; want to 
&gt; know.....
