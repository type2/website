Subject: RE: [T2] 15&quot; rims for my '78 Westy

&gt;http://www.gowesty_dot_com/ has 15 inch rims. They even have factory looking
&gt;rims that are 15 inches. They're pricey though. I wish I could find
&gt;someone else who sold 15 inch factory looking rims. You can even reuse
&gt;your old hubcaps. Did the Brazilian buses go to 15 inch rims? Where is
&gt;GoWesty getting these?

Tire Rack and others sell Mercedes steel rims for their snow tire packages. 
Less than $40 per wheel. Should have correct or nearly correct offsets. 
Check load capacity of course. I have not had the $$$ to pursue this. The 
Merc wagon has a GVW as high as our VW's so that should make us feel better 
.I remember a friend showing me an article which confirmed (once long ago) 
that the Merc wagon was rated for a higher GVW than the Jeep Wagoneer at 
one time. Check that bit of info yourself. That was WAY back in the 80's.

Stockton Wheel in CA can weld your wheel center to ANY size rim.

I'll be pursuing this one day I hope.
