Subject: Fuel Cutoff Switch &amp; Stalling
Message-ID: &lt;37129093.FF16CC1E_at_english_dot_usu_dot_edu&gt;

Hi Listees,

I was having some problems with my bus (70 Westy) stalling every time I
came to a stop unless I was able to give it a little gas.  The little
ballet I was doing every time I came to a stoplight became tiresome so I
finally buckled down and tried to fix it.

As per the archives, some recent posts on one of these lists, Muir, and
a friend who is more mechanically inclined than I, I did the following:

	Ran some carb cleaning gasoline additive through a few tanks.

	Ran some carb cleaner through the carb.

	Thought about running diesel fuel through the carb as per 
	Muir.  That freaked me out too much so I decided against it.

	Finally tightened the Idle Fuel Cutoff Switch on the side 
	of the carb, which was loose.

All for nothing, I was still stuck doing my little ballet at stoplights.

So finally, I went and saw my mechanic (who graciously takes my money
when I've screwed something up badly enough) and asked for his advice. 
He unscrewed the Fuel Cutoff Switch and said it was a no workey.  His
advice:  cut off the plunger on the switch and put it back in; I don't
need it.  Hmmmm.

So anyway, I drove home and lo and behold!  I was idling just fine at
the stoplights -- with no fancy Patrick Swayze dance moves, not even a
little jig.

I'm assuming that Blake (the mechanic with all of my money) playing
around with the switch, &quot;fixed&quot; some faulty connection. 

Anyway, I assume that this is probably a temporary situation so my
question is:  Do I trust Blake's advice and just cut off the plunger
when I have problems again or do I just go buy a new switch?  I know
there's no damage done if I'm not a cheapskate and buy the replacement
part, but I'm all for saving a few bucks too.

Thanks is advance for any opinions offered.
