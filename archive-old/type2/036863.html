Subject: Louvered Window Seals

This can get confusing!  The Interior seal for the Jalousie/Louvered window
is not
available anywhere, to the best of our knowledge.  Wolfsburg West had talked
about
making one, but I asked them earlier today and they have not gone forward
with it.

The two part numbers on our web site are both for the exterior seal on the
68-79 Westy:
241 522 L/R is the West Coast Metric part number and 231 845 413 is the same
seal
with a traditional VW part number.  The prices are a bit different as our
cost is higher
on the 413 part.

Thank you,
