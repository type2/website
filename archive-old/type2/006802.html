Greetings to the List!

About 10 months ago when I bought my Bus (1970 Transporter in very good stock 
condition) I noticed that one of the few things I'd have to repair was the 
turn signal switch.  One had to move the lever up and down to get any sort of 
flash.  The PO had also wired in a replacement flasher.  I found a good 
original flasher and installed that in the fuse block..........it worked 
fine.  The lights actually blinked on their own.  I turned my attention to 
the switch.  The springs inside were weak and the lever would not cancel 
after the turn.  I replaced the switch with a used one which had a good 
return.  I had cleaned it out and resoldered all the connections.  
The problem I have now is that I have no right rear turn signal.  When 
signaling a right hand turn I get a flash on the dash indicator lights and 
then they are dead although I can hear the flasher working.  Front right is 
OK.  Everything else is OK.  And the emergency flasher will operate all four 
corners.
So........I'm thinking it's the switch, right?  But VW changed this turn 
signal set-up around so much in the late sixties and early seventies. I'm 
wondering if there might be any other possibilities.  Any ideas out there in 
listland?

Thanks!

Mike
