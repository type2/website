Subject: Re: [T2] Vacuum Leak, I OWE you one

hope you find your problem as easily as you just solved mine, was phutzing
with it all afternoon,  just went out and went to check the crankcase
vent hose and it was loose and completely off the S boot, but visually it
looked fine, it apparently just worked looose enough, put it back on and
she started right up and ran fine in the test drive around the block

Thanks, if your coming to everybus I owe you a big one....

I knew it had to be soomething simple but had to find that &quot;little
something&quot;

thanks
Bob
