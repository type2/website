&gt; &gt; hey does anyone out there know how to change out the rear rubber mounts on a

Rear is Rear, right?  If so, you mean the rubber mounts on the support
bar?  On 68-71 at least, it's trivial: bolt at top and bottom.  I was
able to loosen the bottom bolts and lift the engine high enough with a
floor jack to swap the rubber mounts out.
