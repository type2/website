1.
I came on this list back in November of 99 after we found a 72 bus and
wanted information about this year and how good a 72 bus would be. I
asked several questions that I bet had been asked just weeks before, I
know I have seen similar questions by new folks to the list since. I say
that because everyone on the list excepted me with open arms and
answered my questions, just as I have seen over and over, no one
screaming &quot; LOOK IN THE ARCHIVES&quot; but now that I'm an experienced user I
find the archives and Library to be a great asset.
It has taken almost 6 months, but we now have our bus to the point that
we can call the restoration complete, YAHOOOOOOOO....
I want to take this opportunity to THANK EVERYONE that has ever
responded to any of my questions, thank you for your TIME and your
KNOWLEDGE, that has given us ONE AWESOME BUS.

Since it is complete I have posted several new pictures on our web sight
at: http://my.treeway_dot_com/MurrayBus
check it out if you like, also look under new westy for other new pics.

We will be camping out at Circle Yer Wagons if any one would like to
stop by and say hello, we will be in the bus that is on our sight.
