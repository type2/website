&gt; it this way?

I have a 78 and I take the engine out by itself almost all the time, just
last week put in a new tranny, took the engine out, then the tranny, put
the new tranny in, then the engine...so it not only is possible some
people prefer it that way.

HOWEVER 

you always have to remove the

. 3 pieces of tin on the rear
. oil filler tube

I have gotten a transmission jack (Harbor freight on sale for $60) and it
has made taking the engine out a real simple job, compare to the hyd jack
I was using.  took that big 2 liter engine out and put it back by myself
last week 3.5 days for a new tranny install, from drive in to drive out.
(automatic)

Now I have the automatic transmission and there are some differences, I
don't have to pull the engine anywhere near as far back before I can lower
it, so there is more clearance, but it has to go in ABSOLUTELY straight
where a manual can start a little angled and become straight as it goes
in, and the shaft is big enough to line things up without damage, compared
to that little oil pump shaft that sticks out the most on an automatic.

remember.  you have TWO fuel lines one on each side of the engine
and there are a couple &quot;funny&quot; wires one up near the fuel presure valve
under the air cleaner. 

MARK all the wires AND the hoses.  really you will never remember the
locations where they go back.  I use little dots of colored paint.  red to
red, blue to blue etc.  also handy is to take a polaroid photo BEFORE you
start of the hoses and wires.

if you do decide to drop em both together I use a chain fall to hold the
tranny up. really easy and there are slots to hook em into on the yoke.

REMEMBER this engine is not a little beetle engine it is HEAVY.

good luck
