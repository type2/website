Subject: advance/retard

I keep hearing reference to retarding timing to cool an engine down.  This 
seems contradictory to what I thought I knew years before and to my own 
experience.  It seems to me that when my timing on my bus/truck/camper was 
retarded ever so slightly, it had slower performance and ran hotter than 
normal.  I was under the impression that advancing (no more than total 
allowable) made it run cooler.  Where did I go wrong?
