Subject: Oil Detergents - What are your feelings?

My '79 FI 2000 Engine has what sounds like a stuck lifter all the time.
Warm, cold, running for 25 minutes, right at startup-- all the time.
The tap-tap-tap is loud enough to cause concern, in my mind.  Last time
I changed the oil I considered dumping in a bottle of &quot;Oil Detergent&quot;
that is supposed to remove build-up and sludge, freeing stuck valves and
lifters.  I guess it is run in the motor for about 5 minutes and then
drained out between oil changes.  I resited temptation on the &quot;too good
to be true&quot; grounds.  I thought I'd see what listmembers think about
these kinds of products.  Can damage result from using this kind of
internal engine cleaner on a 20+ year old motor?  I don't want to cause
more harm than good.

For additional info, I adjusted the valves (they were pretty far out)
and the engine does sound a good deal better, but has not lost the loud
tap-tap-tap.  

Any thoughts and input greatly appreciated.  Thanks to all,

-Ross
