Subject: PDP A/C

My '76 has a PDP air conditioner, minus the compressor. Questions:

1. Does anyone on the list have a working PDP unit?

2. Where did the compressor go? Where is the pulley?

3. Could I retrofit a generic compressor? (I would be retrofitting the 
system with R-134).

I am aware of the issues wrt using an a/c with an air-cooled engine.
