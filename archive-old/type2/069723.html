&lt;&lt; On my 76 Type II, the drivers side wiper catches on the top of the
 windshield on the return stroke if the window is slightly dry.
 As far as I know, everything is stock, but I may havve reversed the left,
and
 right wipers when changing the wiper motor. 
 Are they the same? HOw long should the wiper blade be? &gt;&gt;

Length of stock Bosch, SWF or Hella Blades is about 405mm (US books say 16
inches which is close).  Same blades as on Rabbits 75-84.  The rubbers on the
blades should be cleaned regularly with an old toothbrush and a mild soap
solution.  I usually do this when I wash the vehicle - only takes a minute or
so.  Do not use Armor All(tm) or other protectorant, because that solution
will cause the wipers to smear.  Being in an almost Smog_free environment for
the past three years has allowed the rubbers to last a little over two years
doing this procedure.  In Southern California, I had to replace the rubbers
(or the blades) once a year no matter how much cleaning I'd do.  Left and
Right Arms AND Blades are the same and interchangeable on 69-79 Buses
