Hey Matt,

I tried to dye my curtains, but with no success.

The first time I tried a slightly darker RIT Dye.  All it did was generally
discolor the curtains.  Very blotchy.

The second time, I went to a craft / fabric store and bought an expensive
professional upholstery dye.  Same results except that this time I spent
more cash and it stained the tub I used and my hands for about a week.

Until later,

Darrin

&gt;     Realizing that this has been discussed at length in years past, I
would
&gt; love to chat up anyone who has SUCCESSFULLY re-dyed their late-'70's
&gt; curtains.  There were varying opinions on types of dyes and whether this
&gt; fabric will even take a dye.  Anyone actually tried it?  Thanks!
