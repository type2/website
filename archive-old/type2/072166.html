Subject: Re: [T2] Late Bay Hitch
Cc: &lt;type2_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

This is a bad design for a trailer hitch!!  Don't use this type.  The
weight of the trailer tongue is held up only by the bumper and the forward
and back forces press and pull against the engine cross member which then
pushes/pulls against the front tranny mount.  Terrible engineering.

The best hitch is the one that mounts on both sides of the rear frame where
the bumper mounts then has it's own round cross member that is hidden
behind the bumper.  The bumper does not hold anything and could even fall
off with no affect to the hitch!!  Also any forward or backward pulling
forces are directed straight to the frame which is much stronger than the
early busses.  This hitch does not impare getting to muffler, or changing
oil.  This is a well thought out design.

***I would like to buy ***one of the better hitches if anyone would sell me
one, thanks.


&gt;Here's a .jpg of the pdf I got from hitch-web on the late model bay
&gt;hitch.

&gt;Uh, I'm not seeing this &quot;vehicle cross member&quot; on my '79 deluxe.
&gt;
&gt;Am I blind, or is this wrong?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
