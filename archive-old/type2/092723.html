Subject: Re: [T2] How to best clean Westy top?

Check a marine supply store - your local fishing boat dealer - they'll have 
what you need.


&gt;Hello all... I'm pretty much a newcomer to the list...  I bought a '76 Westy
&gt;(my first) about 7 weeks ago... The pop top and luggage carrier are pretty
&gt;grungy and I was wondering what you all would recommend for cleaning them - I
&gt;think some of it is oxidation and then a lot of it is just dirt and grime...
