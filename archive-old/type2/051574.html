Subject: [T2] Any NW Indiana or NE Illinois folks heading south?

Im looking at a dune buggy thats in NW Indian, but I need to get it down to 
North Florida or as close as possible. It would be an easy tow if anyone is 
heading south or knows of anyone that is. Please drop me a note if you can 
help. I can help pay for gas or ?

Thanks,
David
