Subject: Re: [T2] Bentley on Automatics

Yep that is what I did. The seal I used doesn't have holes nor did the one 
at NAPA. If it did I guess it would have to have four of them.

&gt;From: &quot;Rob Henley&quot; You can tell the difference in the gaskets when you go 
&gt;to the FLAPS because
&gt;there are a different amount of bolts in the 2 different models. The 
&gt;picture
&gt;in the Bentley is for the early model. Count your bolts on the pan and then
&gt;check the gasket against that when you go the the FLAPS to make sure they
&gt;give you the right one before you remove the fluid and pan. Also I didn't
&gt;find a &quot;drain&quot; plug on mine....we had to loosen the bolts and let the fluid
&gt;collect and drain at one corner...this will make a mess!! So be prepared
&gt;with a large container to catch the old fluid.
