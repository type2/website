Subject: Re: [T2] battery to choose?

I use a group 24 battery, which works well.  I think that our buses came
originally equipped with a smaller b*g battery, but the group 24 fits fine
and is a lot easier to find.  It also has more plate area.

I usually buy batteries at my local pep boys for about $45 each.  These
come with a 72 month warranty, and usually last for 5-6 years in our mild
climate.  A bus doesn't need much battery to start, so you don't need to
be picky about specs.  The bigger then numbers, the better!

You should select a supplier that you are pretty sure will be available if
the battery dies before it runs out of warranty.

&gt; I know this has been talked about before but I couldn't
&gt; find a good answer.  I am looking for a new battery and wonder
&gt; if it mattered what one I buy. I asked a guy at Autozone to check
&gt; the price on a battery for my bus and he said the only one that
&gt; would work is $50.  After looking through the archive I saw some people 
&gt; saying get a group 24 battery. The bently says I need a 54
&gt; amp hours battery.
&gt; Anyone got any suggestions on what kind to buy?
&gt; As in specs not brands, what works?
