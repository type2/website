&gt;&gt; OK.  Why do you disconnect the battery by removing the ground cable??
What's so bad about removing the power cable?? &lt;&lt;

Removing the pos cable first can cause an arc from the wire to the post
which can ignite any flammable gasses in the engine bay.  Gasses that are
likely to be right there are from the battery itself.
