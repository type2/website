Subject: Converting bus to 72-74 exhaust.

I am not sure, you will need to check, but if you are going to use the 72-74 
heater boxes, make sure that they match the exhaust on the van. Some were 
square port, and some weren't , Check the Bentley. I do rember that some of 
the features of the 72-74 exhaust were changed in 75, and then changed back 
in 79........

Hope this may be of some help.

Chris

&gt; Since I am in SC, I am thinking of swapping my heater boxes/exhaust to 
72-74
&gt; style.................I guess I have to swap the left side intake runner,
&gt; too.............
&gt;
&gt; Would this work for me?  Anything else I am missing?  The distributor that
&gt; is on it has 2 nipples, too............
