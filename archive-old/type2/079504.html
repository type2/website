More or less, that's exactly what you should do. Call up some paint places
in the phone book and look for a place that does media blasting. When I
was in the process of repainting my Vespa it took me two days of
handsanding just the front fender to switch to a chemical stripper and
another day to say &quot;screw it&quot; and pop for the cash and get the rest of it
media blasted.

Depending on how much you want to spend and how much time you want to put
into it, I'd suggest doing the cheapest (a nice dual action sander, forget
hand sanding, the bus will rust around you before you finish) to media
blasting.

Personally, I hate chemical strippers. Anything strong enough that I've
encountered to get the layers of paint off that you need to get off pretty
much glows in the dark it's so toxic. Anything that doesn't glow in the
dark you're gonna need a 55 gallon drum of it to strip an entire bus.
Maybe the commercially available stuff is better but all the stuff I've
ever used was a pain. BTW. if you accidentally splash a tiny bit of
chemical remover on your arm you'll know true pain. as Ralph Wiggim
said &quot;It tastes like ...  burning!&quot; except you won't taste it, you'll feel
it.
