Subject: Cracked heads normal?

My brother has a reasonably new engine, new case, new heads, type I.

The heads are big-valve.  The engine now has about 10k km on it.

Anyway, we poped off the heads to have a look at how everything was 
holding up and we discovered cracks between the valves.  They were
really small (as in maybe a third of the width of a hair).

We called the engine builder and he said that this was normal (I get scared
whenever I hear that) and the crack doesn't go all the down, its just
on the surface.  Something about temp changes stretching the surface or
something or other.  We aren't planning to pull the valves or anything
like that and at this point are planning to put the heads back on.

Can anyone comment on what the builder said about the cracks being normal
and not a problem?

Thanks,
...Markus
