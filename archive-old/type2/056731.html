Hi,

&gt; I've had a spoiler under Ashley for about 6 months and it does make a BIG
&gt; difference to stability in cross wind, he doesn't hop about anything like as
&gt; much and can be driven faster on motorways as a result.

 Ah, good. That's what I was hoping for.

&gt; Don't know if it is
&gt; better than a lowered bus as I've no experiece with one.

 I was more concerned that it might _only_ be effective on a lowered bus. Given the amount of space under a stock bus I thought that a 110mm airdam might make little or no difference.

&gt; At 35UKP it was a good buy.

 Yes, that seems like a good price- if I can find one for that sort of money I'll be happy. :-)

Thanks for your help.

Cheers,
        W.
