Hi Volks,
   I'm selling my '82 Camper. It's a former diesel converted to gas via an
'83 Rabit GTI motor.  Runs well (finally, after a few FI adjustments)
passes Mass emission standards, new brakes and shocks. Has good tires. I
replaced the diesel trans with a trans from an aircooled Vanagon (better
gearing).  This bus cruises along at '75 MPH all day without breaking a
sweat.
   The body is in great shape.  Interior is good (it has a couple of dings)
but no rips in seats.  Everything works, stove, sink, fridge and is
complete; tables, curtains and bug screen.
   I'm looking at another camper so I'm selling this one to make room for
the new one.  Asking price: $5500.00 OBO.

  If you would like more info please e-mail or call (number below).  Thanks
and take care.
