&gt;Ron, Nat, et al:
&gt;
&gt;What you have described is a fairly classic &quot;bad coil&quot; symptom.  Performs
&gt;fine when cold, but once it warms up, the magic goes away.  Another
&gt;possible cause is bad wires, but I would try another coil first.
&gt;Seriously.  Other things to check include (but, as the warantee book says,
&gt;are not limited to):
&gt;
&gt;Is there a bunch of side to side slop in the rotor shaft inside
&gt;the distributor?  If so, get a new one.
&gt;
&gt;Are there carbon tracks inside the cap?  If so. a new cap and rotor are in
&gt;order.
&gt;
&gt;The 1-3 and 2-4 wires are about the same length.  if you switch the 1 to 3
&gt;and the 2 to 4, do the symptoms now manifest on different cylinders?  New
&gt;Wires, mein freund.
&gt;
&gt;Given that you have installed a new (rebuilt) engine, I would have advised
&gt;new spark plug wires, new plugs, new cap and rotor, and a new set of
&gt;points as part of the job.  If you are still running the old ones, I would
&gt;now advise adding a new coil to the list as pennance for your sins ;-)
&gt;

&gt;PS: (stop reading here if you like your &quot;009&quot; distributor)
&gt;
&gt;Sermonette (rant) on &quot;009&quot; Distributors:
&gt;
&gt;I HATE 009 distributors!  At their very NOS, OEM, Bosch stock, they suck.
&gt;There is a flat spot a mile wide built right into those things from the
&gt;factory.  And the SOTB (brazilian/mexican) repros have an advance curve
&gt;straight from hell.
&gt;
&gt;They were never meant to be run on the street, only the race track.  They
&gt;have a bit more advance over 4K RPM, which gives racers a tiny advantage,
&gt;at the cost of rebuilding after every race.  To get that maximum advance,
&gt;however, you need to advance the idle timing to a ridiculous degree.  You
&gt;don't run over 4K RPM on a regular basis, you probably don't want to
&gt;rebuild after every drive, and you probably spend way more time at idle in
&gt;a week than a Formula V racer does in a year.  The stock vacuum controlled
&gt;distributor will give you much better performance in the range you usually
&gt;drive in and better acceleration too. Honest, believe me, Please!

Thanks for the reply Steve,

The 009 is new, complete with new rotor, cap and points.  The wires I
replaced last summer and don't have more than a couple thousand miles on
them.  The coil is also brand new &quot;Bosch Blue&quot; as are the plugs.

I plan to try switching wires tomorrow and see if symptoms switch sides.

I appreciate the 009 comments.  I am getting clear message from a number of
list members that this is a terrible distributor for the bus.  I guess I
was sold onit when I put onein my 68 bug which ran really nice with the
009.  But is also only had one carb.  I'm seriously thinking about digging
out my old one and trying it tomorrow.

Thanks again,
