Subject: Looking for parts

List,
     I am in need of some parts.  I know I could get them new, but I don't 
have a whole lot of money, and would rather buy used froma private party 
since that is usually cheaper.  If you have a used but working part that you 
can offer me that is on my list, please let me know how much!

Side Markers Front &amp; Rear
Good thermostat &amp; cable
Heater Control Boxes (Flapper things in the rear that control heat output)
Heater tubes that connect control boxes to rear Y ducting
Plastic Oval Alternator Adjusting Nut Cover Plate
Heater Blower Mounting Bracket (Mounts blower to Engine Compartment)

Thanks,
Jay Ollom
