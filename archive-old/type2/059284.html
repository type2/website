I just saw this.

Its a 67. In fair to good condition, some minor damage to front nose panel, no
major rust. Has plates and looks to be drivable condition. Front driver door
different color then rest. Engine looks ok. Has small pop top but no other
inside camper equipment. Interier needs some work in headliner area, floor
carpets and seats good condition.

Located in Dover NY (Dutchess county)
