Many moons past I did a survey of type2 owners, asking them to tell me 
what they paid for their buses and how much they invested to bring them 
to reliable and comfortable condition. The result was the number I am 
giving: $5000. 

Under that, you're running on luck. Which is fine. But I don't see the 
point in kidding ourselves.

A reliable vehicle costing $5000, these days, is cheap transportation.
