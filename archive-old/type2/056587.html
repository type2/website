Subject: I lost the battle, but...

I won the war.  }:)  Well, I will.  

Several times, recently (and not so recently) I've posted about problems
with a 1600DP bottom-to-top (and side-to-side) rebuilt engine.  It's been a
rocky ride, I've been doing my best to do a good job on it, despite my
inexperience and numerous character flaws.  &lt;:)  

This past week, I've been trying to start it, without much avail.  Today, I
found out why it won't start, and it's a problem that I didn't find
mentioned in the archives when I searched just now.  This is probably
because most VW lovers seem to live in places *other* than New England,
with its dementedly umpredictable weather, humidity, and rain.  Or if they
do, they didn't leave their rebuilt engines sitting through a NE winter.

So I thought I'd explain what the problem was, since so many of you have
taken the time to send me messages of encouragement, advice, and even come
over and physically help me work on the thing.  You volks are wonderful,
you know that?  :)  And, if you've let your engine sit in a damp place for
a long time, and you have a mysterious starting problem that sounds like
timing but isn't... read on!  

Ahem.

Starting an engine is a murder mystery.  

No, really.  :)  

In the old murder mystery TV shows (and in detective novels), you'll find
the statement:  &quot;A murder is a three-legged stool.  The legs are 'Motive,'
'Means,' and 'Opportunity.'  Without all three legs, the stool can't stand
up, and neither can an accusation of murder.&quot;  Usually said by the
pipe-smoking homicide detective.  

Starting an engine is a three-legged stool.  The legs are &quot;Spark,&quot; &quot;Fuel,&quot;
and &quot;Compression.&quot;  Without all three legs, the stool can't stand up, and
neither will your engine.  This is usually said by the grease-stained
monkey-wrench detective.  

I have a wobbly stool sitting in my driveway.  And I had to figure out why
it ain't standing up, which means I had to find out which leg(s) were
wobbly or missing.  

As my tool, I used Sherlock Holmes's Razor:  &quot;Once you have eliminated the
impossibilities, what ever is left --no matter how improbable-- must be the
solution.&quot;  

So, in trying to track down my starting problem, I'm attacking a stool with
a razor.  I *love* this job.  :)   

By dint of Herculean effort (not the Disney version, either) I, and my
trusty sidekicks, managed to figure out that two of the stool's legs were
perfectly steady.  &quot;Spark,&quot; and &quot;Fuel.&quot;  The timing was set, the
carbeuration was working properly, the spark plug wires were fine, the
plugs were all sparking and the carb was functioning as it was meant to be,
so was the pump and everything else in the fuel and spark system that I can
think of.  

That leaves the third leg, which I had considered an improbable source of
trouble.  &quot;Compression.&quot;  

You know, I think in the future, I'm going to check the thing that can't
possibly be the problem, *first*.  

I was under the impression, since the pistons and cylinders are new and
unseated, and my rebuilt AVP heads had been ported and polished and the
valves checked and alla that, that my compression would offer no problems. 
After all, nothing's changed since now and then, right?

Naivete, they name is Jazz.  

My first clue that things were not right in Compressionville was when I
took the air cleaner arm off the carbeurator... and gasoline dripped down
out of it.  &quot;Ah-ha,&quot; I say!  One or more intake valves is remaining open! 
This would keep the engine from starting completely, yes?  Yes.  

I recheck my valve adjustments, and what do I find?  *Not* an improper
valve adjustment!  My valves are a hydraulic conversion, and they're all
set to one turn in from zero lash.  *But*, for the intake valves of
cylinders #2 and #4, there's a big old gap between the swivel-foot adjuster
and the valve stem.  I'd say, almost 1/8&quot; of a gap.  Significant.  And it
isn't an improper adjustment; I *just* adjusted those valves to 1 turn in
from zero lash, the day before.  

This is exactly what I was looking for.  

No, I ain't psychic.  After finding the gas, I called my grandfather, who
is a retired mechanic with a lifetime's experience on all sorts of old
cars.  Filled him in with the problem (which sounds exactly like a timing
problem, but ain't), and he said...  

&quot;You're in New England.  And that engine's been sitting for a year, now.  I
had the exact same problem 20 or so years ago with an air compressor; the
damp and the cold-and-heat made the valve-guides corrode a little, and the
intake valves were sticking, causing blow-back and uneven compression.  Go
turn the engine over by hand and check to see if any of the intake valves
are stuck.&quot;  

My grandfather /never/ passes up a chance to be right.  &lt;:)  

After finding out that he was, after all, right on that count (he made some
other, more exotic suggestions, but the first was the most likely), I
called him up, he told me how to try and fix it without tearing down the
heads and replacing the valve-guides.  

	&quot;Take some Marvel Mystery Oil and put it in a squirt-gun with one of those
long tubes, get some into the compression chamber while the intake valve is
a bit open.  Then take off the rocker arms,  use a brass drift with a
*flat* end, make sure it's perfectly square against the face of the valve
stem, and perfectly straight, and give it a sharp tap or two with a
ball-peen hammer.  Then check with a straight-edge to see if it came back
out flush with the other valves.  It didn't?  Do it again.  Just loosen up
that valve from where it's sticking, with the MMO in the compression
chamber, then turn the engine over.  
	&quot;Worked for me and your Uncle Richie on a whole bunch of cars ever since
we found that problem in the first one, and don't let the engine sit
through a New England winter without being started, at least once a month. 
If that doesn't work, you can take off the heads and have the guides
replaced, but it shouldn't be that bad.&quot;  

I have company over right now, else I'd try it out right now and tell the
list how it works.  I'll do it later or in the morning.  If it does... I'll
have a three-legged stool.  

Let's see how it stands up. 

This has been a public service announcement from a novice mechanic learning
new things from his grandfather.  }:)
