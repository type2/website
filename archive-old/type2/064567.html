Subject: Floor protection/cover for underside.

Hi, I wondered if anyone new of such a thing as an underside floor 
cover. Some kind of cover that will stop the dirt and water getting onto 
the underside of the van (specially behind the rear wheel arches). My 
van used to live in Spain where this would not be a problem, but having 
lived in the UK for the past four years and now Sweden, those rust signs 
are coming through!

Regards
Ian
