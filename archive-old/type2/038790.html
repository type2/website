Subject: 75 Heater Blower

 My Brothers and Sisters,
    The relay that sits above my blower is barren. Since I live in Northern 
California heat hasn't been an issue, but efficient cooling is a biggie. Can 
someone please tell me which wires attach to the four prongs on said relay? 
Where they come from and whence they go? TIA
