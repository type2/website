RE:     Copy of: Re: The &quot;4 legged stool&quot;

I stand corrected. You are right , my friend.  I now remember seeing an orange
'73 westy that had that beigeish almost-the-same-color-as-the-vinyl, &quot;burlap&quot;
upholstry on the camping components. Quite a repulsive interior, indeed.  And ,
ditto, again, I now recall seeing a '74 deluxe Yosemite Yellow westy with the
blue/green plaid console box.

 The question of the hour is.... did '74 deluxes come with both the console box
and the 4 legged stool?

Any '74 deluxe owners out there know the answer to this one?
