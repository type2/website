Subject: BN4 Works!

Greetings everyone...
With BN4 heat so elusive, getting flamed by George for a test message was a 
welcome alternative to Vancouver's cold and damp winter (He was kind and 
quick about it)
	OK, if you remember, I had BN4 installed after long rebuild period with all 
systems go *except* fuel pump. Hmmm...
	Then came Luc Perron (71 Dormobile) - another reason to keep Quebec in 
Canada. &quot;Look in the duct in front of the heater, check the thermostatic 
regulator. That's where you're problem will be&quot;, he said. I did as he said, 
and found the most *interesting* thing. You were right Luc, the problem was 
with the regulator, but there wasn't a problem with *it* exactly. The 
problem was that when I removed the heater from the bus the very first time, 
I accidently pulled the yellow wire from it's connector on top of the 
regulator. It's behind tin and never saw it, until Luc's advice directed me 
there - thank-you, thank-you!
	So I solder them back on, install tin and heater, turn it on and 
WHOOOSH...HEAT! All that bench testing paid off and the thing works great. 
Safety systems, shut-off and run-on all work well.
	Now a question for you luc...I checked and adjusted the fuel pump and fuel 
output to specifications, but the heater smokes off and on. I adjusted the 
fuel regulator cap screw until the exhaust runs clean. Is this an accepted 
procedure?
	You certainly know your stuff!
Thanks,
