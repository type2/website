&gt; explain the process in which the heater should start. With the engine

&gt; place is that a relay clicks over.

check to see if the overheat safety switch is stuck in the
&quot;on&quot; position...it is normally open switch that closes in the event of
overheating/overhigh temps.  it creates a ground fault that blows the fuse
and shuts the system down
