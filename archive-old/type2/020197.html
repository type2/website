Subject: VW Radios 1960-1974  HUGE Listing!

I finished going through my stack of Sam's Photofacts and have created an index
of all the radios that I was able to find.  This list only covers the radios
that Sam's published schematics for.  I have sorted the list by Year, Radio
Name, Model #

It can be found at

http://www.dolphinsci_dot_com/vwradios.html

I will post updates if I locate any of the missing volumes.

PLEASE, I'm not setup at the moment to scan/xerox the approx. 1400 pages and
start emailing/pmailing them.

If you look at the list, you can quickly see that each year brought a new model
number for the radio.  Even if it was still the same base model radio (ie:
Sapphire I).  The year and type of vehicle originally installed in is coded into
the model number.  This held true until the '70s.

R2BG - Sapphire I - 1962 Ghia
R2BT - Sapphire I - 1962 Transporter
R2BV - Sapphire I - 1962 Sedan
4TBG  - Sapphire I - 1964 Ghia
4TBV  - Sapphire I - 1964 Sedan
4TBVT - Sapphire I - 1964 Transporter

Enjoy,

Scott
