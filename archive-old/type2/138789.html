Subject: Parts hunt

Tried to order a timing scale from B.D. but they are NLA right now. Does
anyone have one in good condition for sale?
Also looking for two latches that hold the engine hatch closed. Both of mine
are broken and need replacement. haven't seen them for sale at any of the
vendors. I don't know how they got broken. I don't see any pry marks on the
hatch but the engine mounts were all broken, could the engine moving have
lifted the hatch enough to break the latches?
Thanks
Tom
