Subject: RE: [T2] Front Axle Beam Needed

Not to be a smart *ss, if you have some one replace it for you it's going
to cost plenty ($1,000.00-up) And if you can't do it yourself, don't
complain about what they charge, cause it is a big job. I just replaced the
beam on my '77 back in January. It took me 4 or 5 weekends to do the job,
but I took the time to thoroughly clean everything while it was apart ( I
also had to replace the torsion arms as well)and I replaced the front brake
lines, and every seal and grommet I came across. 
It can be done by a person with average skills. While a second person to
help would be nice, I did mine all by myself. Check the library for an
excellent write up (only thing missing is that the clutch cable runs
through the beam and must be disconnected) on how to replace the beam. I
used to have a web page with pictures of mine while the beam was being
replaced, but that was on AOL and I haven't recreated it on Earthlink yet. 
Good luck,   Jeff S.

&gt; needs to be replaced anyhow), does anyone know where I could look in the
&gt; greater massachusetts area and what this baby may cost me??  
&gt; 
&gt; Any help, as usual,  is greatly appreciated.....
