Subject: [T2] Heater Fan

Volks,

I have a 72 day camper conversion that I am fixing up for someone. I
adjusted the valves and installed an 050 as the original carbs were removed
and webers were installed. This distributor seems much smoother than the 090
that I used to get the thing running. Did a compression test at operating
temp and all cylinders are between 110 - 117.5. That was nice.

Now I need to get the heat working. I was able to replace the heater boxes
with another set I had (and some JB Weld). However, the tube that goes to
the front fell off. The Y connector in the rear is still there and in good
shape. 

I need suggestions for replacing the tube to the front AND getting the fan
working. I was going to use PVC for the pipe, but heard that they could melt
or sag. 
What diameter pipe should I purchase?
Was thinking of getting the flexible exhaust at my FLAPS.

Also, where is the switch to turn on the fan?
I have an extra fan and would like to test for voltage to the fan.
It would be quite helpful to know what kicks off this fan as I have only
owned pre-71.

These pancake engines are interesting, but can be a bitch to work on.

Also, can I use a thermostat with the temp range of 65 - 70, or will it run
too cool. The thermostat on the bus was 85 - 90, but I have no idea if this
is stock or not. 
This bus came with a VW shop manual, but it does not have a lot on heating.
The library also glosses over the fan portion of the system.

TIA

Matt
