Subject: Re: [T2] Rewiring A Bus/Smoking Wiring Trouble

I haven't done a VW but you can do the whole system if you take it one wire 
at a time.

We've done several fully loaded hot rods.

Just takes time.

I'd use the same wiring layout as the VW though.


&gt;Has anybody ever rewired their bus completely?  I am beginning to think 
&gt;that the stock wiring layout is not so good.  Twice I have had smoke 
&gt;coming from the wires.  Today after finally getting a rebuilt engine 
&gt;running something went wrong with the starter and the wires under the dash 
&gt;started smoking.  Now everything is wasted.   I am thinking about tearing 
&gt;all the wires out and redoing it all in a more repair-friendly 
&gt;fashion.  It looks to me like the main hot wire leading from the rear up 
&gt;to the dash is about 1/2 the size it should be.  Also it appears that 
&gt;there were no fusible links or anything on the wires.  Is there any reason 
&gt;why a guy couldn't just run the wires along the floor inside the cabin or 
&gt;along the ceiling in a pipe?  I notice the the wires are exposed at some 
&gt;points underneath, that can't be good.  I have the bus from Hell.  GW
