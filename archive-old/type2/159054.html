Subject: Re: [T2] Re:[T2] VW's minivan

&gt; Boy oh boy, that's one uninspiring, boring, minivan.
&gt;

And HOW! Makes everything about the Eurovan interesting by comparison. 
FWIW I like the Eurovan, but can't afford a $40K Weekender.

Maybe that is the key - Eurovan Weekenders for $25K. Sell a million of 
them. Hey, why not - the design is already paid for!!!!

Seriously think about it: what makes the Eurovan more expensive than the 
average minivan? Materials are about the same (and represent only a 
small part of the actual cost of building a vehicle)... Ask Chrysler to 
allow VW to build the Eurovan in America! I'll take mine with a 2.5L 
turbo diesel - thanks... VW still being bitten by the tariffs on their 
trucks/vans?

Of course the American's might not &quot;get it&quot;...
