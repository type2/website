Subject: auto tranny and etc?'s

well, i've been working in my little spare time taking
the stuff off of the old engine and putting it on my
running engine and when i went to take the plate that
bolts up to the torque converter off i noticed that it
had the triple square bolts on it like the cv's but
bigger, so, what size are these?

also, when i took the flywheel off of the good engine
i noticed what looked to be an inductive circuit of
some sort that plugs through the case right behind the
flywheel like something for measuring rpm's but it was
ruined.  i'm tempted to take it completely out but
then i'd have to plug the hole with something else so
i'll probably just leave it alone.

also, when taking off my carbs i noticed one engine
had a spacer between the manifolds and the heads and
the other didn't

one engine had big bolts on either side of the head
just to the outside of where the manifolds bolt down
and my other engine only has one on the drivers
side????

anyway, gurus please send me your wisdom, thank you.
