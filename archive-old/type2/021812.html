Subject: Re: [T2] Sportsmobile Information

Hi Westyman
You could check out http://www.sportsmobile_dot_com/
they even have a social club that meet at least twice a year at a campout,,,

I was camping with the Founder of the Club this summer in Niagara Falls NY..
they are from the Alexandria [sp?] area of Virginia,, near washington DC ,[the
city]
Mind you this couple are a sportsmobile fan,, not necessarily a Vw fan.

Hope that helps
Jamie Rivers

&gt; If any of you have information on Sportsmobiles, I sure would appreciate it.

&gt; I recently acquired a 1970 model and my knowledge until now has been all Westy.
