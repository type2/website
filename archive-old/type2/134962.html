Subject: Re: [T2] 'Remanufactured by Bosch' Alternator

&gt;I know that it is probably cheesy to inquire, but with only a 1 year
&gt; waranty, why should one spend $100 or more for a Bosch rebuilt when thay
&gt; can get a rebuilt alt from Advance for $58 with a 1 year warranty?

When you replace the alternator you should replace the regulator as well and 
have a good battery, all of the above rely on each other and one bad apple 
can spoil the bunch.

The bosch warranty is saying, that if it is a bad alt it will go bad in a 
year, so after a year of service you should be good for a 5-10 years 
depending on use.

Also doesn't Bosch have 24 hr road side assistance with there warranty?

Bottom line you get what you pay for.
