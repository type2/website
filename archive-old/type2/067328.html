&gt;&gt; By the way, I was wondering, what is the proper way to spell Westphalia,
&gt;&gt; I have seen it written both ways, with a &quot;ph&quot; and with a
&gt;&gt; &quot;f&quot;...
&gt;
&gt;I thinks the proper way is with an &quot;f&quot; because with the &quot;ph&quot; you are
&gt;implying that your camper has something to do with male genitalia.

And you mustn't do that. That would be a ph*cking disgrace. Decorum must be
maintained, and you can be confident you haven't offended anybody if you
use the f-words instead of the salacious ph-words. ;)
