Hey guys-

Thanks for all of your help thus far, I am beginning to feel more
comfortable with our bus. We went to run some errands today and had some bus
trouble for the first time since we bought it. Hopefully soon I will be able
to help people with their postings, but right now I need all the help I can
get!

Just a little background info, it's a 76 westy, we just got the valves
adjusted and an oil change. We let the bus warm up for about 10 minutes and
then headed out. It was fine for a block and then started shaking violently,
kind of lurching back and forth. We thought it was an isolated incident; it
has happened a couple of times before, but not enough to not feel safe
driving it. This time it kept shaking and then occasionally dying, so we
decided to head home. We kept it in a low gear, but it didn't seem to matter
what gear it was in. Could this be something with the timing? What is going
on?!?!


Thanks for all of your help!
Cara
