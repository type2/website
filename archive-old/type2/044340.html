Subject: Re: [T2] re: rear deck lid

the engine compartment is at a NEGATIVE pressure (slight vacuum), since the
carb and fan are sucking the air out of it.

The air scoops are located so they allow COOL air into the engine
compartment. If the decklid is open, the HOT air (that just cooled off the
engine, and that is sitting on the hot blacktop) is drawn into the engine
bay. Obviously cool air cools better than hot air.

This is also why having ALL the engine tin and sealing rubber in place is so
vital. One small piece of tin missing (or rip in the seal) and your engine
temps shoot up.

What you choose to do with this information is up to you.
