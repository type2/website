Subject: Re: [T2] Aux air valve/ was when temp sensor II goes bad

It sounds to me like you were testing the thermo/time switch that powers the
cold start valve with the test light taking the place of the cold start
valve.  If that's the case, then I'd say you can mark that test as &quot;passed.&quot;
The cold start valve should squirt just on startup and just when the engine
is pretty cold.  It has nothing to do with keeping a cold engine running.
The thermo/time switch doesn't play a role in the aux air regulator.  The
aux air regulator closes in response to heat generated by its own heater and
engine heat.  I don't know &quot;how long&quot; or &quot;how hot&quot; things have to be for the
aux air regulator to shut down, but it's fairly quick after startup,
probably less than a minute, I'd guess.

Subject: [T2] Aux air valve/ was when temp sensor II goes bad


&gt; I drained the tank this weekend after completeting all of the FI tests I
&gt; could without a pressure gauge ( will get one this week). I noticed some
&gt; rust in the filter and replaced it but it did not seem like enough to plug
&gt; the filter as I was able to drain the tank from the output end of the
&gt; filter. Tank had 5 gallons of good looking fuel. Anyway I was thinking
&gt; about the aux air valve and how long it should stay open. In doing the
test
&gt; with my test ligh tit seemed to work okay but I was wondering how long
when
&gt; cranking it shoud keep my test light on? It made the test light come on
and
&gt; then the light got dim and went out after a few seconds. If my problem is
&gt; some how cold related how warm (head temp guage on #1, oil sump mounted
&gt; guage)  does my engine need to be to be warmed up?
