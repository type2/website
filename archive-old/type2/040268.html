Subject: Albuquerque parts?

Is that how it's spelled?
We're going down to New Mexico from Denver next weekend. Thought I may do
some parts searching while the soccer games are going on. Does anybody know
a source in or near Albuquerque that might have some interior parts, e.g..
rear seat or zbed, camping interior, outside trim, etc. A decent junkyard
would be fun. I've got a '71 that runs well but has alot of inside missing
other than the front seats.
Good bumpers would be a real blessing.
Thanks in advance.

Joel in Denver, '71 trans
