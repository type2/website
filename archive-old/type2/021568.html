Make sure all the connections are very clean.  I had once where the
wiring harness to the battery got really nasty and things would still
kinda work.. but sometimes it'd just click and nothing would run.  I
took off the old harness, wire brushed the fat cable, put a new harness
on and it worked great.

I think the 500 watt amp helped speed up the corrosion on the terminals
:)

&gt; OK.
&gt; 
&gt; After work, in the parking lot, the starter/solenoid would NOT kick over.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran a wire from the battery, outside, to the ignition wire spade on the
&gt; solenoid (I took the ignition wire off the solenoid).
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing...
&gt; 
&gt; I put a voltmeter in line with wire, from the battery to the ignition wire
&gt; spade on the solenoid.  The wire actually was a remote starter switch, from
&gt; the battery to the volt meter, and the volt meter to the ignition wire spade
&gt; on the solenoid.  I could push the remote starter button and watch the volt
&gt; meter (digital)
&gt; 
&gt; When I pressed the button on the remote starter, I got a reading of 12.7
&gt; volts going to the ignition wire spade on the solenoid.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing...
&gt; 
&gt; I push started the VW by hand, as I have done at least ten times before.  It
&gt; started fine.  I got it home.  I parked it on an incline.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, after a solid run of 13 miles, it started.  Again I tried, again it
&gt; started (turned over and fired off and ran)
&gt; 
&gt; OK, how about some help here!!
&gt; 
&gt; Would I be getting 12.7 volt reading if I did not have a good ground??  BTW,
&gt; I have an additional ground wire running from the lower starter bolt to the
&gt; frame, along with previously pulling the ground strap tot eh transmission,
&gt; and cleaning and sanding to bare metal the ground point.  You see, I have
&gt; had this problem for teh past three years.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a Ford starter relay about three years back, and after a while (less
&gt; than two years) it failed to kick the starter/solenoid, even though I could
&gt; hear the Ford solenoid kicking in from the driver's seat - doors open.  I
&gt; replaced the Ford relay with a Bosch starter relay last year, and a few
&gt; months back it failed to kick the starter/solenoid.  I pulled that Bosch off
&gt; and put on another starter.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the fourth starter.  I am prepared with a fifth starter in reserve.
&gt; (Two starters burned up on me; melted the inside plastic stuff, covering the
&gt; starter 'coil' with solid plastic.  Smelled burnt, too)
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions??  This time I was able to get a GOOD measure of the voltage
&gt; to the ignition wire spade on the solenoid.  It was just too much to
&gt; believe.  It laughs at the idea of jumping the ignition wire spade to the
&gt; power connector on the solenoid, and for putting a piggy back connection on
&gt; the ignition wire spade, wired to be touched to the battery terminal when
&gt; needed (this is what I had with the remote starter switch from the battery
&gt; to the ignition wire spade.)
&gt; 
&gt; I need some solid technical advice, not 'take a friend' or 'park on an
&gt; incline'.  I am using those techniques already!!
&gt; 
&gt; Any savvy friends out there care to respond??
