&gt; My engine is rebuilt. It has an alternator, not a generator. The red
&gt; light stays on at idle (the engine is generally idling a little slow, but
&gt; better than it was), and then appears to go off during normal driving.
&gt; However, when driving in the dark, I've noticed that the light actually
&gt; doesn't go off completely--it sort of glows softly. It just isn't bright
&gt; enough to notice during the day.

&gt;I had a bug that did this, drove me NUTS, I tried all kinds of things to
&gt;straighten it out... turned out to be a dirty connector off the battery.
&gt;I think Muir suggested painting over the light with nail polish if it
&lt;bugged you!

I read that also after seeing the dull red light. Figured I'd ignore it after
a visual inspection was fine. Saint Muir was wrong (in this case). Was on my
way to Oktoberbus and the poor girl just quit. No warning as the last 20 miles
had been down hill. Coasted into Billy Bob's Redneck gas station. Another
examination revealed a wire off the regulator. Cleaned and fixed. All I needed
was a charge. I said &quot;I need some help&quot;, they said &quot;if you are driving that VW
Bus out there, you still need help&quot;. Refused do do anything. Bastards. I hate
them.

As luck would have it, there was a tractor dealership next door. I pulled the
battery and had it charged and was on my way.

Don't ignore it. (This an answer to the stock setup. Alt might be different.)

On Muir bashing, when I bought my bus 16 years ago, I would have been at the
mercy all local mechs for all the things I could do better than them. 

On my honeymoon 14 years ago, I had a coil failure. Same story, we do not f**k
with VWs. Asked if I could work on it in the parking lot. Got Muir out and
went through the trouble shooting. Figured out the problem and called a part
store who brought me a new coil. On the road again.

I go nowhere with out St. Muir's book, and never will.
