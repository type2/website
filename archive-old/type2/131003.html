Subject: Looking for good used parts for 82 Westy...

Listees....

I would love to find the following parts used, semi-cheap, and in good 
condition. I know it's kind of a long shot but I had to try. If anyone has 
any pm me please. Thanks in advance.

Oil Cooler
Injectors
Set of heads
clutch
stock exaust system (complete)

Also I have a good Type 1 engine case if anyone wants to do some trading.

Thanks,
Daniel
