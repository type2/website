Hi Ian,

I've got a recent rebuild which works pretty good
except for oil pressure at idle when it gets hot. 
It's got a high volume oil pump (Melling), which I
believe is a good idea for any type IV engine (mine is
a 2L 1980 Westy.  I think the advantage of the high
volume pump is it cools the oil quicker when it gets
hot (I measure my oil temperature at the oil pressure
port).   If you're stuck in a summer traffic jam where
the oil heats up even more than usual, it doesn't take
too much of a rev increase to whip a lot of oil
through the cooler and get the temperature down and
the oil pressure up.  Unfortunately, the Melling
doesn't solve the problem of why the oil pressure is
low at hot idle to begin with.

Rob
