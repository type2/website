Subject: Split:Ventilation Cover Screws

Any screw gurus out there?

One of the screws for the overhead ventilation cover plate on my
'67 Deluxe broke off.  I have drilled it out (carefully) and
would like to run a tap through it before replacing the screw.
For some reason, the threads in all of those holes are *tight*
when I put the original screws back in and I would like to run
the tap through them all before I seal it back up.

Problem:  Even the Type 2 _Parts List_ doesn't appear to list
this screw so I can confirm the thread specs.  Illustration A38
has the cover, the flaps, the knobs etc., but not the screw.
Being familiar with the _Parts List_ I even looked for screws
&quot;nearby&quot; the part for the cover but to no avail.

The screw appears to be 3.5mm diameter and I already tracked down
an M3.5x0.6 tap (for the rare window-frame screws), but the
thread on those for the vent cover appears to be more course.

Anyone have the low-down on these screws or am I better off just
taking the screws on a search mission and eyeball to see if the
threads match?
