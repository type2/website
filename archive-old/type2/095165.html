I just search on vw bus, so you might choose to modify your search =
phrase.  But here's what you can do.  After you perform the search then =
over on the left it will show you how many responses are in each of the =
categories.  Click on the &quot;eBay Motors&quot; link and it will limit the =
search response to items only within that category.  You can also opt to =
search text within the entire message or only the item title.  Sometime =
items are titled poorly and the more detailed search will discover some =
otherwise missed items.  Also utilizing advanced boolean search phrases =
can help to narrow the responses.
