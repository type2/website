Heh, aren't we all :-)

&gt; Anyway, I was thinking about reducing the bore of my engine a bit.  
&gt; This would have two benefits - cooler running and better mileage 
&gt; (maybe - I know there are a lot of variables).

I guess the question is ... does it reduce power enough that it's not 
really worth it?  I have a Westy that I already feel is underpowered on 
some of these pesky San Francisco hills, so for me, reducing the engine 
displacement is a non-starter.

I have pretty much decided to install a CDI.  I think there is plenty 
of anecdotal evidence to suggest that I could see around 30% 
improvement in mileage (15mpg -&gt; 19mpg ... I have heard reports of as 
high as 21mpg in a FI Westy with a CDI).  Parts, including a Malloy 
HyFire VI-A, high-output coil, high-energy/low-noise wires, new spark 
plugs, and a rotor with the resistor removed (I'm too damn lazy to do 
this myself :-), come to about $240.  I figure that's about 5000 miles 
at today's San Francisco gas prices to pay for itself.

...and it seems a lot easier than trying to make a non-standard engine 
configuration work :-)
