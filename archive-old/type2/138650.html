Subject: Re: [T2] Case sealing methods

&gt;From: Mark Hineline

&gt;&gt;You may have gotten lucky with the last one not leaking, but how many 
&gt;&gt;miles did you get out of it? How many drip free miles would you like to 
&gt;&gt;get out of the engine this time?

&gt;Well, the absence of sealant made no contribution to my engine problem. I 
&gt;can't remember who suggested doing without. It was someone on this list 
&gt;whose judgment I trusted (and who turned out to be right).

What I meant was you did not have the longevity that might have presented 
the oil leaks later in the engine's life.

&gt;I don't think that sealants are snake oil, exactly. I do tend to think (a) 
&gt;that if the case parting surfaces have a problem, then sealant won't solve 
&gt;it, (b) case sealant, poorly applied, is far more likely to kill an engine 
&gt;(by closing or restricting oil returns), (c) applying it uniformly is 
&gt;probably an art, and (d) careful torquing of the case bolts is probably 
&gt;much more important.

That is why I would agree with the 574. You take as long as you like and it 
only cures when the case havles are bolted together and the air is removed 
from the equation. We all know you will take as long as you can. ;-)
