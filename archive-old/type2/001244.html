Subject: quarter light
Message-ID: &lt;000901beb96e$172081a0$f112883e_at_tps&gt;

Dear all,
    Isolde was sadly assulted last weekend.   Someone who had obviously seen
me welding on her decided to jam up the lock (which didn't work) and smash
the quarter light- in order to get in and steal my MIG welder and some power
tools.  Yes, I shouldn't have been so stupid as to leave them in there, but
they were well hidden from view, and the welders just too heavy to lug
backwards and forwards- please if you are in my situation make the effort to
take the welder home and not leave it inside the van.
    The result is, I need a new rig, and a quarter light.  Does anyone know
where I can get the glass- can someone like autoglass just cut me a new
piece or will I need to get one s/h- if so can anyone recomend anywhere
(UK).  Time is running out as my new job starts in 2 weeks.  Thanks for all
your help.

    cheers
        Tristan and Isolde
