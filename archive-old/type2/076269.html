Subject: Re: [T2] Oily Air Filter

Definately switch to a lighter weight oil in the winter.  I run 10W30 
synthetic.  Oil in the air box coming from the breather... that's been a 
problem for me also.  I am not sure yet, but I think that excessive blowby 
due to worn rings and/or valve guides is the culprit.  I plumbed in a catch 
can between the breather and the air box which helped some.

&gt;I have a 74 Riviera, 1.8 ltr, Weber progressive carb that uses the

&gt;a way to tesat them or clean them? Could this be caused by oil viscosity
&gt;being too high? I'm running 20/50 synthetic and the temps around here have
&gt;lately gone to around freezing at morning start-up time and 40's/50's during
