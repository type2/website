Hi Volks!

Friend of mine here in Germany does the conversion.  He
uses parts from the Diesel Vanagon from the clutch housing
backward, including engine.  Radiators are in the engine
bay.  Works well; he has converted a dozen or so, using both 
standard and turbo engines out of the Golf/Passat/Vanagon, 
including his own, a '78 home-made highroof camper, which 
he's been driving for years, and hundreds of thousands of 
kilometres, since the conversion.  

A bit of cutting and welding is required, but no special
mechanical parts need to be fabricated.  Almost everything
needed is available over a VW parts counter.

Without a Diesel Vanagon parts van, though, it's somewhat
expensive.  More info via e-mail from me -- he's not online
yet.  He sells a conversion how-to, but there's no English
version available yet.

Airhowlingly yours,
   Erik.
