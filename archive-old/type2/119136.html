&gt; I think you're going to need a slightly more complex trigger for the 
&gt; relay than just the alternator.  When you're starting the engine, the 
&gt; alternator output is probably not going to be enough to close the relay 
&gt; and allow fuel to flow to your carbs.  You'll probably also need to 
&gt; trigger the fuel pump relay from the &quot;start&quot; position on the ignition 
&gt; switch. 

Ah, but you are forgetting that ye olde float bowls usually hold enough gas 
to the engine started up and spinning the alternator. ;-)
