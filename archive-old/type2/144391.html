Subject: AC compressor question

I have a 1978 Westy with &quot;Dealer&quot; installed air conditioning. I am getting
ready to get it going again with new hoses, new receiver drier, new
expansion valve, and a new compressor. It has the York / Tecumseh style now.
I want to upgrade to something like the NipponDenso 10PA17 swash plate
style. Does anybody know the exact make and model of a replacement
compressor? I could do a lot of fabrication and get the 10PA17 to fit, but I
would rather buy a bolt on and spend my time flushing and flushing out the
old evaporator and condenser.
