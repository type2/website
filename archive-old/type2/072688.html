&gt;.Do your other cars feed the exhaust
&gt;to the air intake before the air filter or after, into the throttle, like
&gt;VW does?  Are the passage tubes of similar size?

To my knowlege the type 2 is the only vehicle that used a filter on the
EGR. All vehicles I know of vent to the throttle body after the throttle.
The purpose for the EGR Valve is to shut down the flow during idle so it
isn't affected.

I'm wondering if it's true purpose is to get us to make a $250 donation to
VWOA every 60,000 miles.

Tnx
