Subject: Re: [T2] Type 4 motor, engine stand question...

I hear you Jason, but you are missing my point. Because of all the
mickey-mousing, something could go wrong just because of the stand
test, or between the stand test and the final R&amp;R.
--------------------------------------------------------

i think test stands are those industrial/automotive types of us that know
how to build and operate a heavy equipment and testing gear.  not fodder
for the back yard one time rebuilder.  if you don't know enough about
system dynamics to build and operate the stand your right to just throw it
in the van and test it there.

as for the pallet idea i think the point was missed.  you put a complete
engine and transmission on a pallet and run it.  strap it down with some
cord or straps.  in addition you need a can of gas and a battery.  not
really rocket science but i have a lot of years of wrenching and equipment
building in so i would feel comfortable doing it.
