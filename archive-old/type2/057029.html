&gt; It seems heavy key fobs or large amounts of keys on your chain are a
good
&gt; way to ruin your ignition switch.
&gt; Apparently all that weight swinging around off the end of your key
will
&gt; just chew the inside up.....

&gt; Not meaning to be a killjoy, just know what a bugger it is to
replace the
&gt; damn thing.

Good point!  I neglected to mention that I keep my house keys on the
&quot;VW&quot; keyring and the bus key on a plastic keyring by itself.  I didn't
do this to save the lock, I just thought that it was a bit stupid to
have something on the keyring that readily identifies the car to which
the keys belong.  

Side note: the same thing applies to those keyring remotes for car
alarms.  Put the car key on them and the person who finds them has
both the means to defeat that expensive alarm system and to figure out
which car the keys fit!
