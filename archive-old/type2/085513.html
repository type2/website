Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 &amp; fiberglass

west coast loafer sends:

&gt; The folks at POR-15 claim that it is good for fiberglass repair/resto. I
&gt; understand that it needs to be topcoated... is there anyone who has used it to
&gt; redo a poptop? If so would you use it again or go with gelcoat?

In New Bern, NC, there is a boatbuilder called Hatteras--named after the
home of man-eating sharks. They make seagoing yachts (the smallest boat in
their line is 50 feet long), and they paint all of them with urethane paint.

Your Bus's poptop deserves no less. You deserve no less.
