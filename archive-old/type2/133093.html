Subject: Re: [T2] This turbo kit?

Don,

There is a guy in Tulsa, Ok. that has come to the Eureka Springs show the 
last two years.  Beautiful customized bus with an incredible paint job
and a custom turboed type 4...also a beauty to behold.

I heard someone talking at one of the vw shops over in Tulsa and they were 
trying to catch up to him on the interstate in a late model Honda or 
something....never did catch up to him&lt;grin&gt;.

I didn't personal hear it, but some of the guys at the show said it makes 
the most beautiful sound when it starts spooling up....and IIRC it is 
an automatic transmissioned bus!!

So it is posssible....

Cheers, dave

&gt; Any possible way to get this working on a Type4 1700? Intake and
&gt; exhaust manifolds would be different, right?
