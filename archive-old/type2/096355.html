also the cemetary on the top of the hill, problem though is that the
National park service no longer allows parking in Harpers Ferry they have
a shuttle bus from a remote parking lot, so no photos of our buses in

&gt; us.  Trying to get an event going in our area.  E-mail me at

I will probably come just for Saturday but will commit for a site if you
need the extra for group rate. just need a place to park and open up my
picnic lunch...possible I will come Fri late and just crash in the back of
the bus, but it is not a Westy soooo.
